1ipjnlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRVing/comments/1ipjnlf/inverting_more_outlets/,Inverting more outlets,"My Rockwood came with a 1000 watt inverter that only runs the two outlets next to the bed.  The way I think it runs is that there is a breaker that runs AC to the inverter and the inverter passes that through.  It has a built in switch that does DC-AC conversion if the AC  input is shut off.

SO, it has a 14-2 wire for the output AC and I am curious if anyone knows much about how that is run.   My first guess is it goes right to the bedroom and powers those two outlets.

What I want to do is add other circuits to the inverter.   Specifically the TV and outside fridge along with kitchen outlets.   It's a pure sine inverter, so it should work for TV/Fridge.  It's a little light on watts, but I would love to be able to run a small coffee pot with it.  I am thinking that's going to be impossible to wire..

My two heating options are a wood stove and a tiny wall heater, both located in the living room. The bedroom has no heating whatsoever. 

When I first moved in, the landlord told me she would provide firewood so I wouldn't have to use the wall heater. She dropped off one load several months ago, but when I let her know I was out she ignored me. The next message I received from her informed me that I was responsible for procuring my own firewood and that she wasn't happy I had used the heater. 

If I was on my own, this wouldn't bother me too much. I can get by on an electric blanket and plenty of coffee. However, I have a ferret who needs to be warm. I can't stand the idea of her freezing while I'm at work, so I leave the heater on for her. 

I wasn't provided a copy of my rental agreement, so I can't reference any potential heating clauses. Even so, this feels less than legal. Any advice is appreciated. ",1,1739563527.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

# 3: Cast down into Babel

*“Chaos is the score upon which reality is written.”* 

*-Henry Miller*

# September 25th, 2022

 “The government has confirmed that it is, in fact, a spacecraft that is headed towards Earth…”

“Some Representatives claim that the pictures are a hoax by the government to distract from the state of the economy…”

“The Prime Minister stated that they would work with their fellow NATO partners to make sure…”

“Most major markets were down today, with the Dow down 3% today amid a wave of both buying and selling as jittery investors reacted to…” 

“President Xi Jinping accused the United States of withholding information about the craft this morning as the US in turn…..”

“New York City was tense today as demonstrations of people for “peaceful contact” were met by “anti alien” counter demonstrators. Police had to….”

“No, look, I’m just saying the timing of the announcement is terribly convenient for…”

Fiona stopped flipping through channels, sighed, and turned off the TV.  There had still not been any contact or any communication from the alien ship, and it was now just three days away from Earth.  The streak as it flew through the sky was now easily visible to the naked eye. The US government had finally become unparalyzed enough to confirm its existence yesterday after giving its scientific establishment time to analyze the pictures the satellites had managed to pick up.

It was pretty much what she had expected. Her own thoughts interrupted her. No, to be honest with herself, it was worse. Sure, intellectually, she knew people would spout conspiracy theories, be afraid, and so on. She knew chaos would result. But she didn’t expect it to build this quickly and this loud, did she? 

It would be easy to blame the reaction of the public or the average member of parliament on ignorance, but the truth is, they were all ignorant. Even those “in the know” knew very little. 

She snorted as she remembered the precis on what they knew about the ship. The list of “unknowns” had been very long. They knew how big it was now, and that was about it.  They *believed* that the crystal hair-like protrusions near the end were radiators to help deal with heat, and that the orange part was the power plant, but the scientists Randy had talked with had made it clear those were 100% genuine SWAG(1). 

There was one additional thing Randy had confirmed, however.  By now the projections were certain: unless the alien craft radically changed its velocity or course it was going to enter orbit around Earth itself in five days. She didn’t really know why that made things worse or more emotionally immediate, but it did. 

She sighed, stretched, and sent an email out to the team so they could discuss next steps. Hopefully with the people she had put together they could come up with some sort of plan or response that was more organized than the incoherent mix of fear, paranoia and hope that she saw at Parliament and elsewhere.

(1) Scientific Wild Ass Guess

# September 26th, 2022

“The internet is a mess right now. More than usual, I mean. New conspiracy every minute. Lots of different reactions. No clear overall trends.”  

Bindi was finishing up her presentation on the general response of the population to the formal public announcement of the alien spaceship headed towards Earth. As she finished, she rubbed her head as though fighting off a headache. 

She was not the only one. Since she had seen everyone arrive and settle in, Fiona had struggled not to let her alarm show. She had selected each of these people to help guide their efforts, and had hoped they would be able to rise above the chaos engulfing the world, but she could feel their tension.  Every statement, every movement was alive, vibrating with the energy of the world outside going mad.

Eduardo, thankfully, seemed unaffected.  “Thanks, Ms. Khatri. Ms. Lee, I’m sure all of us read your excellent memo, but if you could go over the highlights for us to refresh everyone’s memory before we proceed, I’d appreciate it.”

Sophia, the only other person who seemed unaffected by the mood, nodded calmly.

“Certainly.  Similar to Ms. Khatri, there’s very few clear trends because the reaction in governments has been a bit chaotic and varied. The major powers accusing each other of hiding information about the aliens is the main point I wanted to raise.  Russia and China are accusing the US, and vice versa. The EU response is a bit more muddled, but they seem inclined to side with the US. Various countries outside of that circle all believe the major powers are also hoarding information to one extent or another. Japan fears China, Latin America is suspicious of the US, and so on and so forth. Lots of local variations, but the main trend is suspicion. On an intergovernmental level, same thing. The FBI, CIA, NSA and so on each are worried the others are hiding something. I could give you other examples, but you get the point.”

“\*Are\* any of them hiding something?” asked Randy.

Sophia shrugged. “Our own channels into the various intelligence agencies as you know, are highly informal right now, so my assessment is something like an informed guess. So far as I can tell, everyone knows next to nothing beyond what we already have established, which as we well know, is next to nothing outside of the observable physical characteristics of the craft. If anyone knows more, they are keeping it very quiet.”

Gérald frowned. “We need better intelligence if we’re going to start preparing any sort of military response.”

Sophia nodded. “Of course we do, which is the primary thing I am working on: making better contacts and more contacts. Do any of the people you know from the various armed forces have any information?”

Gérald shook his head.  “Not that I can tell. Dr. Groves, anything from your corner?”

“Not much. The one thing that’s come out is the well, not even a theory, more of a supposition and I want to emphasize that, that the alien ship is powered by a fusion reactor of some sort. That being said, it fits the facts we know. The amount of energy required for the ship to be at the speed it’s at without the assistance of gravity **and** its steady deceleration at its current rate for the amount of time it has held that steady deceleration is immense. In the world of space travel we refer to this as a spaceship’s “delta v”, that is, the amount it can change its own acceleration.  Given the size of the thing, it's difficult to see how a fission reactor could practically produce the energy required for the amount of delta v it has produced. Even if it **is** using fission it’s to a degree of efficiency and power we aren’t sure how to duplicate.”

Bindi sighed and looked up at the ceiling. “Great, so the one thing we know is that it's technologically advanced to a degree that we aren’t sure how it's doing what it’s doing, which we already knew, but now we know it more. Fantastic.”

“We really need to expand our connections with the intelligence community. I feel like we’re fighting blind here.” Gérald grumbled.

“I am aware of that, I’m working on it.” Sophia stated with deliberate precision.

Bindi glanced at Randy, Sophia and Gérald in quick succession.  “I don’t want to add to the chorus here, but it's going to be difficult to shape any sort of public relations campaign without at least some more facts. From anywhere.” 

Gérald sighed. “Thing is, the armed services in general don’t have the right kind of internal intelligence networks for this task. They are organized around assessing the capabilities of armies, ships, planes, that sort of thing. It’s why I keep coming back to mentioning the more general intelligence agencies like IntCen(2).  I think we should expand our efforts to make inroads in those circles.”

Sophia's voice remained calm, but became cold with controlled annoyance. “Certainly. And while I continue to do that, you can talk to some of the folks you know and remind them that they control at least a few spy satellites that at this point could observe the thing and give us some more of that information we need.”

“Yes, like you, I’m…”

“Yes, well, maybe you…”

Fiona, caught by surprise, watched it unfold as the tension in the room finally snapped and became a chaotic argument with everyone trying to talk at once.  Up to that point everyone, however frustrated, had managed to keep the discussion at least somewhat calm but then suddenly, all the tension that had been building for days as they all tried to find any answers exploded.

“I just think..”

“What you don’t see..”

“Not going to be…”

 

“It’ll be us who die…”

Suddenly, Eduardo stood up and knocked firmly but calmly on the table. The room fell silent.

Other than standing up, his face was impassive, and when he spoke into the sudden silence his voice was quiet, conversational.

“Alright folks, I need each of us to take a deep slow breath.  All of us here are trying our best. The fact of the matter is all of us, all human beings, know very little. You may remember I mentioned that we needed to get used to and become comfortable with not knowing things. This is what I meant.”

He smiled slightly as he looked around the room.

“I see in front of me a group of hard working dedicated people who are, without anyone ordering them or as part of their actual job, trying to put together some sort of coherent picture of what is happening. The problem is, that picture is still being drawn. You are all correct: we need more information.  All of us are trying, I can assure you, to get that information. But, and I want to make sure we all really start to take this to heart, we will for the foreseeable future be making highly educated guesses about what is going on based on incomplete information. Even if, right now, we could answer some of the questions we all have, more questions would arise, and we would still be here, confused. How could we be anything else? The world around us has been thrown into chaos, and we here can only reflect that as we try to make sense of it.”

He sat back down as the silence continued.

“Ms. Lee, Captain Amar, Dr Groves, please continue to make the efforts you have been making to make contacts and gather information.” 

He nodded to Gérald. “Captain, I understand and share your concern about the lack of intelligence and its likely impact on military operations, but remember, we are in essence in the same position as the people of Mesoamerica when the Spanish arrived. We are by definition at a disadvantage. If we need to fight these aliens, it will be the type of fight that people at a technological and military disadvantage fight against an invader. In other words, I need you to start thinking like you are fighting a guerrilla war….as the defender.”

He again smiled gently at each of them in turn, then turned that smile on Bindi. “Ms. Khatri, I likewise understand that effective PR work needs information. But we are not yet at a point where we will start our PR campaign. What we need from you is similar to what we will need from the others. Dr Groves will tell us of scientific developments and the reactions of the scientific community. Ms. Lee and Captain Amar will do the same for the intelligence and military communities. But your job is just as important because one of the key facts we need to know before we start taking concrete steps is the shape of the reaction of everyday people to these developments. Popular support is one of the prerequisites for a successful guerilla resistance movement. To build that support, we need to know what people are feeling and thinking, why they are doing that, and what strategies and stories seem to be having an effect. Then, we can plan an effective PR strategy.”

He chuckled with little to no humor. “I’m aware that ‘wait and gather more information’ is a challenging thing to do right now. We want to act and act decisively. But all of us will need to get used to waiting, to investigating and then building plans not for a rapid victory but for an eventual one. As the defender in this potential confrontation, we cannot, given the gap in our abilities, achieve a rapid victory. We can only prevent the aliens, if they are aggressors, from winning a rapid victory themselves. I know putting together the picture that will see us out of our present chaos is difficult, but we will put it together, piece by piece.”

He shrugged.  “The fundamental reality is that our towering confidence that we are alone in the universe has just been cast down and we are scattered, confused, and searching among the rubble of that confidence for meaning.” 

He nodded to each of them. “Very well, let us gather ourselves back up and begin to see where we all are, so we may begin not to rebuild, for what we were is inevitably and permanently lost, but to build anew.”

Bindi drank her chai as she scrolled down. The titles of the various videos were enough to give her a pulse of how things were developing.

And so it went. She sighed. No change since the first public reveal, just more of the same.  The internet could be depressingly predictable some of the time.

She kept scrolling.  Two more days.

“It’s going to enter the atmosphere.”

“Hmm?” Randy looked up from the memo he was reading. 

Carol, his lab assistant, pointed at her screen. “It’s going to enter the atmosphere.”

He walked over, saw the latest reports and models on the ship's current trajectory. He nodded, smiled at her a bit, then reached for his cell phone.

\-

# September 30th, 2022

“Good Evening, this is BBC Nightly News. Our top story this evening is that scientists are confirming that the alien spaceship is on a course to enter the atmosphere and that it will do so within about two hours. We’re keeping up to date on the latest developments from 10 Downing…”

Fiona switched the channel again.

\-

“Look, I’m just saying, why don’t we shoot it down with some jets, hmm?”

Gérald glanced down from the TV from the bar he was in. Pierre shrugged.

“If they were friendly, they would have said something, *non?”*

Gérald shrugged. Pointed up at the footage of the various protests around Paris, as well as the crowds just out on the streets, experiencing the moment that was in the air.

“My guess? The governments are too distracted.” 

–

Sophia tapped her fingers on her desk as she thought for a moment. “What can you tell me about where they estimate it’s going to land?

Greta, her contact at the SIS, sighed a bit and rubbed her eyes. “Latest I heard is somewhere in central Africa.”

“How are your connections there?”

“Decent. Fiona put me in touch with a few people she knew from when she was Chief of Station at Lagos and Deputy Chief of Africa Affairs.”

“Ok. Talk to those contacts. Tell them that if the ship lands wherever they are posted, we want at least some access.”

“I can’t promise you direct access to the ship itself, Sophia.”

She waved that away. “Didn’t expect it. I imagine that’s going to be a circus anyway. But can you at least get me some samples of anything they find? And let someone observe from a distance?”

Greta chuckled. “You don’t want much, do you?”

Sophia nodded. “Trust me, I understand. Everything is up in the air. But I know and respect your work and we have worked well before.  I have confidence in you.”

“I understand. Can’t promise, but probably. Probably not much. Whatever we find will instantly become the most valuable stuff on Earth, even if it's just dirt.  Bring someone to the landing site.  I’ll see about giving them some access, but at a minimum they can receive a sample.  I can already tell you it’s going to be all but impossible to just ship this stuff without someone intercepting it.”

“I can do that. I’ll send you the info on who to expect.”

“It would be nice to be able to predict at least a few things right now.”

\-

Eduardo kissed his son goodnight then went downstairs. He turned on the TV and sat down on the couch with his wife, hugging her a bit. Other than the TV, the house was quiet.

The minutes passed by in companionable silence. He sipped his coffee.

“We’ve gotten reports from the Pentagon that a live feed of one of the satellites that will be in position to see the ship enter the Earth will be made available to us when the time comes, until then we’re here with General…”

“What do you think is going to happen when it does land?” his wife asked.

“To be honest, I don’t know.”

“But aren’t you…” she gestured vaguely. He had explained to her what he was a part of. Had told Fiona that one of his conditions was being able to tell her. If he was going to be working late for the foreseeable future and taking random trips, Cecilia deserved to know why.

“Yes, but it's difficult for me to convey the exact depth of uncertainty that our informal little group has of things, an uncertainty shared by the people we talk to. And between us, trust me, we talk to quite a few people.”

She sighed, clearly anxious. “I wish we knew more.”

He shrugged. “Can’t disagree with you there.”

\-

Fiona was back to flipping channels. It was the information junkie in her, she knew, but it was a habit she couldn’t stop.

On Valentines Day. I’ve always meticulously shopped for my wife’s favorite chocolate, she loves coffee mugs and cats so trying to find one of those…spending 20 plus minutes finding the right card, with the right words that would segue into what I would right, and beautiful flowers. Something different every year but all centered around her favorites.

This year, things are different. As I felt the anxiety build of what to get, how do I express myself to her, how deeply I love her, and believe…that something new could be made moving forward. Then I realized something that caught me off guard. There’s no desire….for any of that. No cards. No flowers. No fun tumblers or coffee mugs…nothing. One of the things I was most scared of, losing my desire and maybe even love towards her, it seems like that has happened. And though I can’t lie and say there’s zero conflicting emotion, this, was one of the more freeing things I’ve encountered thus far, the freedom to not have to force or lie about desire and love.

1ipjik1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ipjik1/need_advice_on_my_girlfriend_who_isnt_affectionate/,Need advice on my girlfriend who isn’t affectionate,"TLDR: alcoholic and mentally unstable gf is not affectionate in the least and don’t know what to do.

This might be stupid so sorry in advance.
I’ve got this girlfriend who i love dearly, literally the only girl that I’ve ever just been hit through the heart Cupid style head over heels for. The catch? Lots of unresolved issues/trauma/baggage. She is also an alcoholic and avoidant and potentially narcissistic ( I don’t like calling people that because I don’t want to be mean to her especially so please help if it sounds true or not).

Context is everything so I’ll try to be as concise and impartial as possible:
She is early 30s, mum died tragically at 21 a few months before a major sports achievement (that she successfully achieved!) then her two grandparents (all her fav family essentially) family kind of broke apart after that, father drank heavily and had new lady within a few months, wouldn’t let her stay with him when she needed a place, older brothers moved far away. She never felt she had a home or support. When I met her had just gotten out of an engagement to a very wealthy older guy who was apparently quite abusive and controlling and he broke things off.

When I first became her friend I found out about this and about a suicide attempt (booze/drugs +wrists) prior and I felt for her.
We spoke for months and I tried to not let myself get too invested because I didn’t want to put pressure on her or scare her off but I really started to like her… she also treated me kinda like garbage though, defense mechanism I guess, but I didn’t hold it against her. I got her a coffee every day and left it in a special spot so she could grab it without people thinking we were together (I didn’t want to make anything uncomfortable for her in public) I would drop off care packages at her door when she would have a downward spiral. I even was first response for first aid when she had a seizure at work.
Bought her a bunch of gifts (I’m proudest of an engraved frame for photos of her and her mum) for her 30th. At this point (4 months) I had made her dinner and taken her out a bunch and only ever gotten a kiss on the cheek (stoked!). 
Night before her bday we slept together ( I was SHOCKED, asked her if she was SURE she wanted that three times before I even agreed) we had an amazing time, just sensational, then 3 or 4 days later she got super dark on me when I asked her out to lunch and she screamed at me to leave her alone and give her some space. I was hurt but agreed. She didn’t speak to me for 6 months, no word or reason or anything. Cold and MEAN and hurtful at work and I had no idea why and I was heartbroken.
6 months later she reaches out and I’m pretty hesitant cause she fucked me up big time. But I still had love for her so entertained it at a distance as long as I could.
LOTS of sex happened. Then sadly, my mum had to move in with me because she had to have chemo in my city for 6+ months (blood cancer) so I was helping look after her and still seeing my lady.
Time went on (approx 6 months) and more sex, super happy with her and work and family. Then she got pregnant, I was shocked but she was more shocked, she told me that her ex had told her she couldn’t get pregnant (never mentioned anything prior) so I found that a bit strange (before ex fiancée she had gotten pregnant like 3 times and ended them) but was happy cause she was happy she knows her body works. Yay! 
I’m scared cause I’m a Personal Trainer/ striking coach and don’t make a lot of money but I love this girl and for the first time ever I’m like holy crap I wanna have a kid!!! But I calm down and say hey! Whatever you wanna do I support it, I know it’s a lot but love you and will love this. She gets quiet and I also say that if she doesn’t want to keep it I’ll be very sad but respect her decision cause it’s her choice, the only caveat is that there won’t be a second time cause I don’t want her to go through that pain again.
We continue with life, I take her to any appointment she needs, I wanna be there for her 24/7 whatever she wants. She starts drinking quite heavily around me, starts pulling away, less contact, less affection, ignores calls and messages. Day of op I have to beg her to let me even wait in the car park of the hospital, only reason she lets me in is because she doesn’t have a phone charger so I run around and buy one for her.
Op happens, she’s drugged up and I’m very sad. I ask her if I can stay with her that night and she says she needs space so I leave, I’m devastated.
Next couple of days I message and get no replies, I make her a bunch of fried chicken and vegetables and drop it off for her, no hug or kiss, barely even looks at me. I’ve seen this pattern before, she’s getting ready to leave, just like last time. 
4 days after op, seen her once and spoken maybe twice. Messages me first thing in the morning at work and breaks up with me. Devastated I tell her I love her and I’ll always hold space for her if she needs me, she tells me don’t, she can’t do it anymore. Radio silence… (3 hours later I get my contract terminated at work, long story but bad day/week essentially.
I’m pretty much close or at the worst I’ve ever felt in my life and I’ve lost my dad at 10 and buried my best friend at 24.
Here’s the hard part, just to prove that I’m a PoS and don’t deserve sympathy. The day before she dumped me I slept with a friend of mine, a girl who had for a few months the year prior stayed with me while waiting for brain surgery on a tumour that was killing her.
Yes I was spiralling, no that’s not an excuse. Yes I’m still trash.
I had also slept with this girl while she was staying with me (she initiated it because I felt super weird sleeping with someone I was trying to help) but had stopped when I had started catching feelings for my lady even though we weren’t even dating at the time cause I didn’t want to be a fkboy.
So after feeling low enough to jump off a bridge the lady who dumped me suddenly did a full 180 24 hours after dumping me and suddenly wants to go to dinner that I had been booking and cancelling the last 3 weekends (she was too sad/sore to go) all of a sudden. IM essentially recovering from emotional whiplash as the guy who’s been stomped on multiple times by this girl who I just wanted to love.
She kinda implies she still wants to be together but when I ask she avoids the question for more than two weeks.
Her lease is running out so I offer to help move and help sell a bunch of her stuff while she looks for a place or moves in with her bro.
Girl I slept with gets pregnant (even though she has mireena…dang) lady finds out and breaks a bunch of my things and cuts up some clothes (understandable).
She moves in with her brother and sis in law.
Has a huge fight with them after a few days and throws her mums ashes around the house (yikes).
I turn up cause she texts me (I need help now! I’m in danger) won’t answer calls so I freak out and see that scene.
I try to speak and she slaps me in the face a few times and screams at me that I made her get an abortion (not true at all, hurtful though) family is shocked.
I help tidy things up and put some items in her car.
She’s screaming at me to take her home (don’t want to cause she’s violent and unwell)
She messages me a photo while I’m waiting in my car after she has retreated to her room to calm down of her arm with bloody letters “done” carved into it. I RUSH into the house and show her brother the photo and we open the door… she’s asleep with a knife in her hand but no marks. She faked the photo and when she sees our worries faces she laughs.
Yes fair point I should’ve cut ties then. At what point does love become idiocy? 
She “calms” I offer her my spare room until she finds a spot because she doesn’t have a “safe” place or a “home” she has “no one”.
She gets a little comfy after a while and kinda wants to be together again.
Comes to family Xmas, family love her and buy her gifts and treat her as family. I tear up cause it’s really nice and all I wanted.
New year comes, intimacy drops a bit but she’s busy so that’s okay! I get her some herbs and veg and tidy up the house and backyard so she can tan and chill out.
Been over 2 months and not once has she helped clean or do laundry or wanted to help with anything. I’m like cool she’s really busy and stressed that’s okay! I make dinner 5-6 days of the week just for her (I meal prep a lot).
I’m busy one day and ask her to just swap the washing into the dryer and turn the knob to “extra” to dry, I get back 3 hours later and clothes are still wet and dryer got put to “damp” Or some weird setting.
I ask SUPER politely “oh babe what happened? I asked it to be put on this setting, it’s still wet. It’s no problem! I’ll just Chuck em on, sorry if I wasn’t clear!” 
She gets really upset saying that she can’t do things to my standard so that’s why she doesn’t do them. 
I’m pretty confused but apologise if I said anything rude to her.
Two days before my 30th I feel pretty burnt out and depressed and she is watching Netflix on my ps4 and I come home miserable, she’s drinking as per, I hop in the shower, door open as I do, and then a bout hits me and I turn the shower off and sit in there with no water for probably the better part of an hour. Finally I pick myself up and get out. No check in on me, no question. 
I pluck up the courage to say hey I’m feeling terrible, she asks if I’m okay, asks if she should call one of my friends, then asks if I want to come to the shops for a drink (she needed mixers) I say no thank you, she asks if I’d like some cookies and I’m like actually that would be lovely. Gets drinks but doesn’t make cookies. No hug, no kiss, nothing.
I ask why no affection or check in or even hug?
She says “I did my best” 
I just say I would’ve loved a hug at any point.
She says “you didn’t ask”
I just get really sad and go, do I always have to ask for a hug from my girlfriend when I’m sad?
She gets angry and says that she’s tired and she did her best and that she’s clearly not enough for me, I freak out cause I didn’t mean to upset her I just felt really down. She then proceeds to get mad at me and I snap and raise my voice (subjective I know but not a super loud, I hate yelling more than most things) and ask her why when she’s sad the world needs to stop and apologise and I’m here with love and hugs and food and anything she needs, but when I’m sad I get told to suck it up, don’t be a victim, it’s not all about me. 
She starts hiding in the corner behind a chair shaking and having what seems to be a panic attack (never seen one before in person) and I immediately switch into caregiver mode and ask her what’s wrong and she’s saying don’t hurt me don’t hurt me (I’m 6”1 but holy crap I’ve never put my hands on her I’m a goddamn softie).
I freak out and she hides in the bathroom in the tub and then I ask has someone hit you? Was it your ex? And she’s like “of course it was” so I apologise for raising my voice and she’s like no I’m leaving and moves all her stuff into the spare room and says she will go when she finds a place.
I ask her to stay and what can I do and we talk for a while and she says don’t yell and if you want to say something write it down first. I’m like okay done. I just ask her to be nice to me, hug me without being asked because that’s what people do who love each other.
Birthday arrives, no happy birthday, no hug or kiss. She takes me to dinner but we wait at her (new) work for over an hour before dinner cause she’s busy. It’s okay I love spending time with her.
She bought me a ticket to Fiji the week prior cause she had leftover miles from a canceled trip last year.
My (ex?) drops off a cake without a word on my door morning of my birthday, even makes it gluten and dairy free for the girlfriend to share.
I get yelled at, no messages all day and i apologised even though I hadn’t been in contact with her since the incident (she had to deal with it on her own cause I’m a PoS)
GF cancels the trip because she “can’t find her passport” finds it the same day she cancels but sadly just hours after she cancels “oh well I can reschedule any time”
Birthday kinda sad, no sex and no cuddles in bed.
Valentines week.
Last minute she tells me her old friend needs a room for a night cause she’s flying back to Europe, I clean the back room and whole house and set up candles and towels cause gf is too busy. GF spends all Monday with her friend even though she had brought up and I had agreed we should go see my parents and have a mini vacation at the beach (step dad was put in hospital a few days prior) cancel that plan because she spends the whole day with friend (love to see her happy) then gets heat stroke cause she was drinking alcohol but no food or water at piha) spend 3 hours that night looking after her 10pm-1am with ice tea towels and AC and monitoring breathing and pulse. Next day I just let her rest but she goes A&E for water in the ear (poor thing) put on movies and cook and look after her. Wednesday I special order Dubai chocolates for her and take her to yum cha and get her a big bouquet of flowers, I get a big smile and a hug (first hug of the week) after the flowers.
On way back from lunch I politely ask why no intimacy lately? Love her to the moon and not about sex but also no head, no affection, no cuddles, no hand holding even.
She immediately gets mad saying I’ve made her feel shamed and I apologise profusely.
I sleep on the couch cause she doesn’t say a word the rest of the day. I’m just trying to give her space and not set her off.
Next day tidied up her own mess for once (I message her thanking her for making the lounge look so nice) even makes me a snack before training (can’t remember last time she did that)
It was very sweet.
Go to bed, no contact.
Valentine’s Day. She gets up, no hug or kiss or happy V day, says she’s taking her car to mechanic and has a bit of work. Leaves at 8:30am. I rush out to get the stupid chocolate that I pre ordered and leave a simple note “happy Valentine’s Day” on them.
I get back at 4pm and she hasn’t been home, no message or call, lots of Instagram posts/stories though.
She gets home, barely acknowledged the chocolates, opens up some clothes she got, shows me the articles she wrote (she has 4 jobs)
9 in one day, fantastic, very proud of her! I’d been sad all day cause again no affection but the little things kept piling up like time to post but not to say hello? And I didn’t want to bother her or have her yell at me so I held it in but I asked her for a hug, didn’t move, I went to her… I whispered “hey I’m really sorry for asking and I don’t want to upset you cause I love you but I was just wondering…” and ask why no love? She gets upset and tries to leave. I beg her to just answer and explain how I feel and why I feel that way. She just repeats the same thing she always says. Her mum died and she hasn’t known love since then and she’s so busy and she doesn’t have the time to be more affectionate, she’s done nothing wrong, she will never be enough for me, she has things more important to do because she needs money to make sure kids she has can grown up how they want… I ask if it’s a time thing, she spends 10 minutes at least every night chasing after the cat I let her adopt to give it hugs and kisses, is asking for 5 seconds of her time for one hug and one kiss too much? She didn’t answer.
Gets to the point where I ask “what purpose do I have in your life?” Because it feels like I am just barely an afterthought. She says she’s probably be dead if I wasn’t here and that I overthink cause I have the luxury of having too much time (ouch cause it’s been hard start of the year with clients).
Then almost in the same breath says that maybe we aren’t the right people for each other because I need someone who’s more affectionate. I ask what do I add to her life. She says “a lot” I ask for an example and she says she shouldn’t need one. I beg for any. She says “you feed me, you clean up after me, you do my laundry” I’m her maid, heartbroken…
She then says it’s cause I’m on my period and I have a sore ear and I got heat stroke and I’ve got so much work.
I just begged “please just tell me if you’ve checked out of this so I know what to do with myself” she says she’s tired and needs to go to bed but then moves almost all the stuff she has into the spare room and walks around the house saying “you slept with her again didn’t you?” (I haven’t, not even close, I’ve been 100% for her) then picks up a cleaver and says it would be nice to smash the kitchen window, then says yes you’ve been cheating she’s text me (I haven’t been cheating so know I’m scared cause she’s just saying things now.
I tell her I still love her and I’m not kicking her out but if you are wanting to leave just let me know when.
I got to bed and she messages me a photo of some relationship quote saying “not everyone wants to change, let them. The best way to love someone is to love them as they are”
The thing is I DO love her, the way she acts hurts me to my bones. I still love her. Always will. 
I wake up and she’s cold as fuck and has written a note saying “please don’t hurt the cat, she’s all I have left. TY” 
I ask what she means by that? I’ve never hurt her or any animal and especially not her kitten.
She leaves without a word to work and I’m left here. Depressed and feeling like over a years worth of love and dedication and patience has been all for nothing.

I guess what I’m asking is. Am I the bad guy?
Am I being a little Whiney douche? 
I train and I work and I cook and clean and I listen and I offer advice and I give space. I respect her and love her and value her.
I’ve just started to hate myself more and more every day and I don’t know what to do.

1ipjiju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1ipjiju/nanny_use_of_our_credit_card/,Nanny use of our credit card,"I am interested in peoples’ views on our nanny’s approach to using our supplemental card.

We currently employ a nanny full time who is a few months into the role (and she historically temped with us years back, so is relatively known/trusted by the family).  We have always issued our nannies a supplemental credit card so by they can pay for expenses without it hitting their own bank account - e.g., trips out, kids’ clothing purchases, groceries etc.

We’ve always been fairly trusting and never asked for receipts each week/month (a) because it’s a hassle to go through; (b) we can see activity on the card statement (or banking app in real-time) and (c) we like to think we hire sensible nannies.

A week or so ago a new card came in the post for the nanny (addressed to me). I called the card company and they explained the previous one had been flagged as lost and a new one requested. Nobody told me about this.  I checked the account and there was no obvious fraud, so I assumed our nanny had lost it and decided to order a replacement without telling us. Trying to see the positives, I guess it’s proactive/efficient, but it’s not very transparent. That made me mildly irritated, but nothing more.

I looked more closely at the transaction history from that week and noticed a couple of odd transactions including a taxi charge and a juice bar which is not in the vicinity of our house or the school (where she picks children up each afternoon). I called the card company to get timestamps - the taxi charge was 12 minutes before her shift started that day; the juice bar was an hour before school pickup when she is child-free and gets on with admin (eg meal prep or out the house to get things for the kids). It seemed that she had used our card to Uber into work and then buy herself lunch outside the house a couple of hours later before heading off to school.

I pulled her up on the replacement card, asking if she had lost it, and queried both of these transactions. Her response was that it was fine and couldn’t have been fraud, as the old card would have been automatically cancelled when she ordered the new one (slightly missing the point). She said the taxi may have been a mistake on Apple Pay and she’d check (a week later she has said nothing further) and she was silent about the juice bar (which btw was just under £10, and happens to be the cost of a sandwich at this ridiculous overpriced Gen Z favourite High St chain). I was peeved but my wife said to let it slide in the interests of good employee relations - we had put a marker down and she should get the hint going forwards, my wife said.

Today, our nanny went to pick the children up from school, but left very early (it’s a 10-15 minute drive, she left 70 mins before the gates opened). She seems to have used our card to buy herself a coffee/snack from a well known high street chain, 25 mins before the kids came out of school. I may be missing something, but is it normal for a nanny to take herself off to a cafe solo and buy herself a drink with the boss’s card? For what it’s worth, I spent an obscene amount (thousands!) on an automated coffee machine at home last month which I’ve told her she’s more than welcome to use (with speciality beans delivered to the house each week). This has irked me, but I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable/stingy.  I won’t divulge our nanny’s salary, but she is well paid. It takes just about 6 figures of our gross income for us to afford her salary+NIC+pension etc.

We have always told our nannies (and our contract expressly states) they can eat/drink whatever food is in the house while on the job. But using our card to cover the cost of coffee/lunch/snacks out the house when not with the children (and when she could otherwise be doing this in the house with existing supplies) is taking liberties, in my view. Am I being unreasonable? I haven’t brought up today’s issue, but wanted to get a sense check from the Reddit vanguards before making a fuss.

It’s not so much the cost that bothers me, but the concern that this behaviour could be part of a broader tendency to play fast and loose in other respects.",1,1739563311.0,Nanny,1,0.67,False

Can be summed as:

“We will protest with the economy! Dont spend on anything!”

If super rich class wants to dismantle the economy are we not playing into their hands? 
Is this call not screwing up what little left of middle class that the rich wants to make extinct for the past 50 years?

If Tech Bros really plan to dismantle governments and establish feudal network states, are we not helping them further by rattling whats left of the economy?

The call should not be cut all spending, instead the call should be cut all Transnational spending. Instead of buying Starbucks go buy coffee from your local coffee shop. Go to local farmers markets etcs. Juice from local shops instead of coca cola.

The only way to survive is to strengthen local communities, the very thing they want to destroy.

Making everyone poorer will just make everyone ever more desperate to be the cattle in their feudal network states.

Before grinding the grinder will sound perfectly normal but after running a dose through it, it sounds like the burrs are rubbing together. Is this just coffee being stuck between the burrs resulting in this noise? When I turn the machine off it seems like the burrs stop quickly as if theres friction between them. This grind also stalled the machine for a second at the start but still pulled 40g in about 15 seconds. Any help would be appreciated.",1,1739562685.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

He is the first man I was able to trust blindly and the one who showed me that love and loyalty can be real and true. He healed me and my inner child, he gave me tenderness and support I never had experienced before. But even in something so beautiful, we had many issues. He is a full time musician getting busier and more popular as time goes by. Me being an introvert who wants a quiet simple life is not compatible with the kind of lifestyle he leads and wants. Even though he is not a touring musician yet (although it's highly likely it will happen soon), he is still very busy and it was hard for him to make time for me. It was so hard for me to have to do so many things alone that I would have wanted to do with him. Simple things like going to the park or going for a coffee were special occasions because he was just not available. Even though he did try so hard, he was never going to be able to give me the shared time and life I wanted with him. I am so deeply and desperately in love with him but missing him so much and feeling so separated from his life was making me unhappy. I feel in my heart he is and always will be the love of my life, but after almost 2 years of trying I couldn't see another way anymore. Breaking up with him has been the hardest thing I ever had to do. I should have known from the beginning that it was not a good idea, but I couldn't help falling madly in love with him. My heart is hurting. The only comfort I have is knowing that he will have the amazing life he deserves. ",1,1739562616.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

Sleep came fitfully. The high desert can seem to be so alive with roaming terrors on such moonless nights. 

I was ever so glad to see ol’ Sol on the horizon the next morning. 

Over coffee and breakfast burritos, I outlined the plan for deposing the world of the Rosalita Number 8 mine once and for ever. 

“OK, here’s the plan. I’m staying back since my suit’s a fucking disaster and I had enough of all that yesterday. So, we’re going to plant cases of dynamite in the entrance of each raise and winze off the mezzanine. I want to connect the Seismogel and lower it down the main shaft. We’ll mine the main tunnel with RDX on the way out. Arch will do his spider monkey act and C-4 the exterior adit and I want to set all the RDX and PETN our military friends gave us right around the campfire the boys built. We’ll do the raises and winzes electronically, the C-4 we can handle with the blaster board. I want a central tie-back to a pile of whatever we have left over to take out the mezzanine. Questions?”

“Order?” Jerry asked.

“The raises and winzes first, then the main shaft. We’ll charge the main adit and that’ll be next. Then the big one in the mezzanine, followed by Arch’s handiwork on the mine adit.” I replied. 

“Questions, comments, *et cetera* anyone?” I asked.

“Nope”, they replied, “Let’s get after it.”

“Indeed.”, I agreed. “Cletus, you’ll be on logistics support. You and Leslie can drag back what we need.”

Cletus agreed. “I’ve built a sled of sorts out of sheet tin, so we can drag in all the shit we need in one go.”

“Outstanding.”, I replied, “Remember to galv every single circuit. I’ll hold on to the radio detonators until you all are out of harm’s way. “

“Roger that”, came the reply in unison. 

I spent the day running circuits, checking the manifests and doing the inevitable mountain of paperwork that attends all these little outdoor chores. I was able to disappear each time the local news weasels showed up. I was on the phone with the Sheriff several times to advise him on how things were progressing. 

“How are the families holding together?”, I asked. 

“It’s really dreadful, Doc”, the Sheriff replied. “There were two set of brothers with those kids off the Nation. I’m glad you kept a lid on the news as the families wanted to come out to thank you and your teams for your work and see that mine breathe it’s last. Damned thing is, they all were most broken up about the need for closed casket funerals. I saw one of those kids you recovered for just a second when we took them to the county coroner. Damn, Rock. You must be made of cast iron to look at that, shoo the bats away, and roll them over in the dark for a little dignity in that stinking shit-filled mine.”

“All in a day’s work”, I lied. Truth be told, I might have to seek a little head-shrinking help in slaying some of the new demons I’ve picked up recently. 

But that’s for another day. We have work to do and I told the Sheriff that we’d be kicking off at 1400 hours, MST. He was most welcome to observe and help keep those newsy root weevils out of our hair. 

The charging of the mine went as planned and actually faster than anticipated. It was now noon, and I had a couple of Deputies on loan to keep everyone the fuck away from the mine. They also guarded all our electrical ordnance initiators, keeping them safe from prying eyes and agile fingers. 

“Jesus, Cletus”, I said. “On the way home, stop off at the truck stop in Aztec and get those machines washed. God damn, they stink.”

“You’re not coming back with us?” he asked.

“No”, I replied, “I’ve got a bit more to handle after the show this afternoon. I’ll meet you all at the hacienda tonight, around six or seven.”

“Roger that, bossman”, he replied. He and Arch shared a sly grin. What the fuck were these two up to now?

The Sheriff arrived, as planned, right before the big show. I was shooting what looked like outsized bottle rockets into the mine to scare the bats out. 

“Sorry, guys, but you’re evicted.” I said to no one in particular as the rockets screamed off into the inky blackness.

Two PM rolled around and the air was filled with people clearing the compass, calling out if things were clear and blasting air horns. 

“FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE!”

I let the Sheriff mash down the radio button that actuated the servos and initiators on the cases of dynamite that were in the raises and winzes in the far backside of the mine. 

You felt, rather than heard the detonations. Evidently, dynamite and a hundred years’ worth of bat guano makes for some simply spectacular KABOOMS. 

Jerry hit the radio detonator for the Seismogel, all 250 pounds of it, hanging in the main shaft. There was an Earth-rattling explosion and a gout of black smoke, soot and batshit shot directly north out of the mine from a small opening we had missed. 

I used the blasting board to destroy the main tunnel. KER-BLAM. FAGROON. KUBBLE KUBBLE it voiced as it collapsed in on itself. 

Elaine hit the radio detonator for the grand mezzanine. The explosion was incredible as the top of the mine collapsed in on itself. It left a surface scar some three hundred feet in diameter. 

I pointed to Arch and he lit off his C-4 handiwork. The bat sanctuary sign disintegrated, a nice touch. The rest of the C-4 sealed that hole for ever and ever, world without end, amen.

I left it to the teams to police the area and get things stowed. I shook everyone’s hands and told them that they had all earned bonuses. They were pleased, but more than one told me that’s not the reason they were doing this. 

“I know”, I said, “That’s why I hand picked you for my teams.” 

Everyone had their marching orders and I went with the Sheriff to take care of a little unfinished business. 

We stopped by all the families who had lost someone to that mine. I wanted to meet them and see if they had any questions or if there was anything I could do for them. 

This took a couple of hours and totally emotionally drained me. They were all so glad I found their children, especially those of the Nation, as now they could make the journey. If their bodies were lost, so would be their souls. 

I’m not religious by any means, but it does make one think. There’s such a difference in how one group handles a catastrophic loss like this and how others see it. I had hoped to bring about some closure for all the families. I passed out my business cards with the admonition to call me if they had any questions or just needed to talk. 

They were all very appreciative and I was somewhat gob-smacked. I don’t know if I’d act the same way in talking to the guy who found and recovered a dead child.

Since our house wasn’t that terribly far, the Sheriff offered to have one of his deputies run me to the house and drop me off. 

I accepted as I was trashed mentally and physically. I really didn’t want to even think about driving. 

We made it home in record time. Especially since the deputy loved to drive like a loon, run the siren and scare the bejesus out of the locals on the road. 

“Well”, I said, “We’re here. Thanks for the ride. Take it easy heading back.”

“Oh, no problem, Doc”, he grinned widely with one of my cigars firmly planted in his yap. 

He smoked down the road, onto the freeway and was gone in 60 seconds. 

I looked and saw that Cletus and Arch had the dozer and load lifter hosed off, as well as my truck and they were all nestled, snugly along the western wall of our house. But then I noticed one of those big, fucking bus-sized RVs parked next to our eastern wall. 

“What the actual fuck?” I wondered aloud. 

Someone heard me and blew my cover. As I was walking across the road, I hear Khan flipping out, Clyde meowing, and a voice I’ve not heard in the first person for some time. 

“TOIVO!”, I shouted, “What the blinkered hell?”

I opened the gate and was greeted by Khan, Clyde and strangely enough, another Mastiff of the Tibetan variety.

“Toivo?”, I asked. “What gives?”

“Well”, he laughed as I could see he was deep into my liquor cabinet, “You always said that the doors were open at the *Casa de Rocknocker*, so here we are.”

“Who’s we?”, I asked.

“Oh, you’ll meet her in a few minutes. Her name is Shirley and we’ve been going together for the last few months.” Toivo explained. 

“So that’s your monstrosity parked next to the house?”, I asked. 

“Yep”, Toivo beamed, “Got it for a song down in Oklahoma. Fucking Tower Topplers is going great guns. So instead of going to the job and then going back, we just show up, blast the damned things and spend the night in the field before heading to the next job.”

“Very efficient. I’m impressed.”, I reply. “Now, what’s this all about?” I ask as I’m blindsided by mastiffs on both sides. 

“One of the guys I had working for me had her”, he explained. “He got sent upstate (i.e., up the river, in the pokey, detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, booked at the gray bar hotel, etc.). Since he’s out of the picture, I figured since you had Khan, well, he needed a playmate.”

“Really?”, I asked. 

Clyde disappeared. He realized this was all dog talk and therefore, boring. 

“Yeah”, Toivo beamed. “She’s a real peach.”

“She?”, I asked worriedly. 

“Don’t worry”, Toivo said, “She’s already been fixed.”

I took in a long, deep breath. 

Kahn seemed to like her just fine. I am wondering about Esme though…

“So”, I asked, “What’s her name?”

“You’re going to love this”, Toivo beamed. “T’Pau.”

“Really?”, I asked. 

“Oh, c’mon. Tell me you don’t know the source of that name…” he drifted off. 

“It’s the name of the Vulcan High Priestess in Amok Time, Star Trek, The Original Series.” I said. “T'Pau was a Vulcan diplomat, judge, and philosopher who became one of the leading figures in Vulcan history.”

“I knew you’d know”, Toivo laughed. “C’mon, let’s get to know her.”

“Let me in first so I can call Es. I’ll meet you all in back at the fire pit.” I said wearily. 

“OK”, Toivo said, “See you there!”

“What a day…” I muttered as I sloped into the house, dropped all my gear and slipped off to my office. 

I called Es and told her I was back and that things were generally horrible. However it was all over and we can put another one in the dead zone. I neglected to mention Toivo or T’Pau, as that’s just not something you drop on someone over the phone. 

We expressed our mutual love and I assured her I’d pick her up at the airport in a couple of days when she returns. 

I changed into my household togs, grabbed a couple of cigars, got a drink and headed back to the fire pit. 

I met Shirley.

“Squirrely Shirley”, as she put it. 

“Charmed”, I replied. 

Toivo roared with laughter. 

I sat down, fired up a cigar and called to T’Pau. She responded instantly and was by my side immediately. 

So was Khan. 

She’s not as big as Khan, but probably goes a good, solid 200 pounds. Furry as a grizzly bear, bright attentive eyes that actually gave the appearance of innate intelligence. 

I looked to her and looked at her face and collar, which boasts her rabies vaccination just a few weeks ago. 

I ordered Khan to stand down, as I wanted to see if T’Pau had been trained. 

I have to give her that. Well trained, and she listened to me because, I think, Khan listens to me. 

“Well”, I said, “Khan. What do you think?”

“WOOF!”

“OK”, I resigned, “It’s official, we’re now a two-mastiff residence.”

T’Pau must have understood as she crawled into my lap and demanded a proper petting. 

Khan stood there, looking on approvingly. 

Toivo laughs. “I’d hate to be a burglar around here. Imagine jimmying a door only to be greeted by 500 pounds of furious canines.”

“Oof. Maybe I was wrong”, I said, “She’s two and a quarter if she’s an ounce.”

I gave her a little push as I was reaching for my drink. She and Khan loped off, barking and carrying on. They got on like gangbusters. 

“What am I going to tell Esme?” I wondered aloud. 

Clyde slunk out from behind my chair. I reached down and gave him a good ear scratching. He allowed that but then grew weary of humans and sidled off somewhere to do feline things. 

“Damn”, I exclaimed, “What a menagerie.”

I was able to make it another hour. I had to excuse myself as I was still body-shocked and brain-weary from the last few days. Toivo said that was OK as he and Shirley were going hot tubbing. 

“Enjoy”, I said, “Just keep it down. I need some sleep.”

“That’s affirm”, Toivo chuckled. 

I pad back into the house and see Cletus and Arch sitting at the breakfast table. 

“You guys are free to head home if you like. Or you can hang around until after New Year’s”, I said. 

“We’ll hang for a bit if you don’t mind”, Cletus said. 

“By your leave”, I said. “Right now, I’ve got to get some sleep. Please lock up before you hit the sack. See you all in the morrow”. 

I turned to pad up the stairs and into our master bedroom. 

I see Esme’s bed, but where my bed used to be is now covered by over 500 pounds of sacked out Mastiff. 

“OK you two”, I said, “Shove over. I need some sleep.”

After an inordinate amount of cussing and pushing, I had Khan on my left side and T’Pau on my right. I couldn’t roll over or move much, but damn, I was warm as toast all night. 

Of course, nature’s call must be heeded and there’s nothing more fun than shifting two snoring behemoths at 0200 hours.

“Where did I take that wrong turn?” I asked a pitch-black and silent room. “Where did I lose control?”

A distant voice seemed to say, “Where did you get the delusion that you were ever in control?”

Time, as its wont, passed. Cletus and company had all departed after I filled their trunk with frozen hams and turkeys. I could tell this latest job had weighed heavily on them as well. I made certain they were paid and strongly bonused. 

Toivo and Squirrely Shirley decided it was time to move on as well. He explained that he had to hotfoot it back to Texas to drop more of those awful bird-choppers. I did ask them to stay until after New Year’s, but he was adamant. 

“I need the cash. Shirley’s got expensive tastes.” He lamented. 

“Except in men”, I chuckled. 

“Asshole”, Toivo said reverentially. 

“Shithead”, I replied in kind. 

A jovial manly handshake ensued. Toivo and Shirley blasted the RVs horn shrilly as they departed. 

“This was a Christmas for the books”, I exhaled heavily. 

Now, only one little item left to go. “I said to myself, reminding me that I needed to drive to the airport and retrieve Es in a day or so. 

With a little sleight of hand and use of well-worn credit cards, I procured a limousine to pick her up at the airport. I made certain it was well stocked with libations and comestibles, along with a post-Christmas present of finest silver from the north of Spain. 

I talked to her before she left the Turks villa and explained that I was head-down, ass-up and up to that ass in alligators. 

It wasn’t far from the truth. 

I said that I’d have her met at the airport and driven home in utmost luxury. 

“What have you done?”, Esme asked conspiratorially. 

“Me?”, I tried to sound offended. “I’m working like a rented mule.”

“Yeah.”, She chuckled. “OK, see you in a bit.”

“I’m counting the minutes”, I said. 

I arranged for the house to be scrubbed stem-to-stern. All laundry done and put away properly. Groceries delivered, pantry stocked, and garbage binned. I even had Khan and T’Pau visit the doggy groomers for a bath, clip and proper poofing.

I hear the melodious tootle of the limo’s horn and rush out to greet my wife and grab her baggage. My wallet also took a hit as “he’s such a good driver” and was tipped accordingly. 

“So, how were the flights? Hungry? Want a drink? What’s up? What’s new?” I asked trying to make like everything’s normal. 

Around here, normal is most abnormal. 

“Time to switch to decaf, Doctor”, Esme chuckled. “What’s going on?”

“Oh, nothing”, I replied as we entered the house. I had Khan and T’Pau out in the back so I could wrangle a few minutes to try and come up with some story for Es. 

She leaned over to scratch Clyde behind the ears. 

“Where’s Khan?”, she asked. 

“Oh…”, I ummed, “He’s out back.”

“Well”, Es decreed, “Go get him. He’ll get all pouty if I don’t let him welcome me home.”

“Sure”, I replied, “Just a minute.”

I went to the door and whistled. 

Khan and T’Pau ran in and almost bulldozed Esme. 

She scratched both behind the ears. She complimented them on their natty razor-clip hairdos. 

I just stood there slowly blowing fuse after fuse. 

“Well”, Es smiled, “Aren’t you going to introduce us?”

“Um, what’s, a, the deal here?” I asked. 

“Toivo called me while you were out on that last job. I knew you’d never say no. I’m a little irritated that you think I would.” Es explained. 

“You knew?” I asked. 

“Yep”, she grinned, “Even before you did.”

“So”, I exhaled, “I bought that silver bracelet for naught?”

“Hardly”, she smiled and shook her wrist to show me what I had bought her. 

“I like it”, I said. “But I love you. So, she can stay?”

“If you think I’m going up against you *and* Khan, you’re a little more shaken than usual.” She said.

“I do so love you”, I said. 

“You better, you bet”, Es smiled, “Because you’ve just spent every good husband token in the bank. I own you.”

“Damned if I’d have it any other way”, I said. 

After dumping the luggage upstairs, I suggested we get comfortable and spend some time in the Jacuzzi or just around the fire pit. 

Esme agreed. 

I said I’ll whip up a couple of her favorite drinks and meet her Jacuzzi side. 

“There is one thing you must do first, though,” Es noted. 

“What’s that?” I asked. 

She pointed outside, toward the fire pit. 

“Train T’Pau to stay out of my recliner. It looks like it’s growing a new dog with all that shedding.” She chuckled. Her recliner now hosted our newest family addition. 

“If it’s not one thing, it’s another”, I sighed and walked the tray of Mai Tai’s out to the Jacuzzi.

I 20f have been dating my boyfriend Milo (not his real name) 19m for about 3 months now. I’m sort of spiraling about this for some time now, and I’m truly starting to think I did something for this to happen. Here we go. To start off, he is very religious than i am. I never had a problem with this in all honestly. I think it’s great that he has his bible studies and takes time to talk to god and what not. He does a lot that follows the book and what not. Whereas i just go to church here and there. It also doesn’t bother him that I’m not as religious as he is either. Some other things too we met at work where we work with children, and the reason i fell in love with him was because of how well he works for kids. We’ve gone on a lot of cute dates like coffee dates dinner dates. The other thing i really love about him is how nurturing and caring he is about making me feel comfortable with myself. I used to very insecure and used to hate how i looked or felt. Especially past relationships made it hard for me to revel skin. But Milo has made it to where i feel beautiful again and i try really hard to be the best girlfriend I can be. Now here’s when it started to get odd. Or maybe I’m overthinking it. I have strict parents that i live with currently until i can eventually move out of. Money goes to paying my school so trying to buy an apartment isn’t an option right now. When one of us really wanted to see the other, I’d either sneak out of my room and we would go in his car and drive around. OR he’d come into my room and we would do the deed or watch movies in my room. We just did a lot when we couldn’t be together in public. And the only reason I believe we never went to his house to sleep was apparently because his parents can hear every thing that goes on in the house? (His words not mine) So anyways, every Thursday and Sunday is when Milo would come over to hang out with me since this was when our schedules aline the best. Recently I noticed he’s been a little distant when we cuddle or hang out lately. Me, having anxiety, would ask him if he’s alright, and that i was here for anything if he needed to talk. But he always assured me he was fine. I always left it there if he didn’t want to tell me anything more but I would try and be extra loving because I didn’t like to leave him alone. Then we come to yesterday. We decided we would celebrate Valentine’s Day a day early since we both work on Valentine’s Day I figured we could exchange our gifts together. I snuck out and he took me on a cute little date, we watched YouTube and ate in-and-out. While we were driving he said he had something to tell me. I was nervous excited and kept poking at him to tell me. I was laughing and joking because I felt like he was going to say something funny. And then he told me, “God spoke to me recently” I blinked and said oh? And he kept going “God told me we can’t have sex anymore until we’re married” To that, I didn’t really react at first because I thought it was a joke but he looked upset so I just nodded, and asked why. He told me “Because it’s distracting me from achieving things and well.. it seems kind of meaningless.. or I just, I want to express myself to you in other ways and I’m just..” he was just mumbling at that point but that was the sum up of the conversation. I didn’t really say much I just tried to comfort him because he’s been feeling this way for a while. I didn’t ask a couple questions. Like if I was the problem and if I did something to make him feel this way. Which he did say no, but he wasn’t looking at me anymore. And my stomach felt tight. He gave me a list of dos and don’t from now on.
Dos: We can cuddle, kiss, make out, hug, hold hands, sleep together.
Donts: No sex, masturbating, nudes, or dirty talk.
He said we’re aloud to be handsy but that’s it. Which once we got home he started feeling me while going to sleep. I was just staring at the wall, wanting to cry, and I suddenly felt small again. I feel I truly did something for him to change his mind like this. I don’t know why it just was very out of know where for me. I know that this is also part of his religion, and I understand that. But why would he tell me to send him nudes and revel myself to him so much if he had been secretly wanting me to wait to be pure? (Which my first time unfortunately was not with him) I’m not against it, but I feel sad. I don’t know what to do, I haven’t really told anyone how I’ve felt about this because I don’t know how I could explain this feeling. I know he says he loves me, but I feel there’s just a lot he’s hiding from me. I’m sorry this is so long. ",5,1739561872.0,relationship_advice,10,0.73,False
1ipiy3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1ipiy3a/how_i_was_able_to_start_feeling_energetic_and/,How I was able to start feeling energetic and healthy again,"I wanted to make a post to try to offer any tips and advice to people it might be able to help. I have had increasingly bad G.I. issues since I was a toddler up until now or I finally have been diagnosed with gastroparesis. 

At one point, it was getting so bad that for months all I could do was sleep. I couldn’t barely keep anything down, with severe bloating and acid reflux. I was in a constant state of flareup to the point I was losing 3-7 pounds a week and in constant pain.  Now, I am finally at a place I can maintain my weight, have energy, and no pain. 

What has helped me: 


1) A positive mindset - You genuinely have to believe that you are going to get better. You also need to find the positives about your situation. One thing I always told myself is that one good outcome about this is I have been overweight my entire life I was finally losing weight. 

2) Adhere to a diet of safe foods strictly - I do not eat or drink anything dyed, acidic, fried, high in sugar, fat, or fiber, raw foods, red meat (wild caught fish I can tolerate), or heavily processed things. I have entirely limited my diet to safe foods with the exception of situations where I do not have any food available. In those *rare* I have to get fast food, I will eat a piece of pizza, a burger, or an egg burrito because those two cheat meals do not give me as severe side effects as others do. My go to eats are mashed potatoes, baby food, low sugar, high nutrition protein shakes, avocados, fish, steamed low fiber skinless vegetables, yogurt, organic light pasta, and coffee. If you’re going to consume dairy, make sure to limit it as much as you can, and take Lactaid with it if available. I do understand finding a diet of safe food is pretty expensive sometimes and that’s why this list is pretty much the only things I eat right now. 

3) Powdered nutritional supplements - previously I was so nutritionally deficient and anemic that every time I stood up, I would get lightheaded. I bruised so easily that i looked like I was being beaten up. The fatigue was so incredible that I did not have the energy to leave the house. I couldn’t even take a warm shower because I would immediately feel like passing out. In tandem with the diet, what has helped me immensely is getting powdered vitamins. In pill form they are much too rough on my stomach and I can’t digest them. This is made worse by the fact that with gastroparesis you’re supposed to eat very small frequent meals since you are supposed to take vitamins on a full stomach. I am now feeling so good that I can go to MMA class. I’ve even noticed that I’m not bruising nearly as much as I used to. I have more energy and I’m not feeling like I headed and fatigued it all the time.

4) Exercise - I have definitely noticed a trend where motility seems to be increased when I exercise. If you can get yourself to the point where you have enough energy just to take a walk after eating, do it. Don’t push yourself too hard though and attempt a full workout when you are fatigued and under nourished. I have also noticed that strengthening my core muscles has been really beneficial because I can expel bloat better. In my opinion, you should save working out with any higher level of intensity for after you feel better. 

5) Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate - Not only does it help with motility, it helps with energy, and keeps your body working when you’re having flareups and you can’t eat. Water with a liquid IV packet is a godsend. A Gatorade can work if you are desperate but I would get a zero and do your best to avoid dyed anything.

I really hope this helps. Please know this advice is only based off of my personal experience.",1,1739561849.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False

“However few”, I smile reptilian-ly back at them. 

We flew low and fast. We made Miami a full seventeen minutes ahead of schedule. 

We putter around Miami International Airport and set gently down next to a gleaming blue and white Gulfstream jet. 

Saying goodbyes to all, I am hustled out of the helicopter and fifty feet later, up the stairs to an empty aircraft. 

Empty of passengers, but a full flight and service crew. 

“Doctor Rock?”, I was asked, “Please follow me, we’re next in line.”

“You’re kidding”, I said. “This place is jumping.”

“That’s true”, the flight attendant observed, “However, we have flight priority. Please find a seat and strap in.”

No sooner than I had buckled up that the jet roared to life. All hatches secured and we were rolling out onto the tarmac. 

There was a bulkhead display of ground speed, altitude, and various exterior cameras. 

It was great fun to watch the numbers fly past as we chewed up the scenery. We were on our way west a mere matter of minutes later. 

We did settle out at 58,000 feet AMSL and flying at Mach 0.96.

Now I know how Chuck Yeager must have felt. 

I was offered lunch and drinks, and of course, accepted. 

Smoking was verboten, but I could wait a few more hours. 

In chatting with the air crew, they were amazed that the jet had been seconded for just one person. I regaled them of tales about abandoned mines, rescue and recoveries. 

Even these military folk admitted to getting the jibblies when I described some of our nastier turns of events, especially with recoveries. 

“Why do you do it?”, one of the air crew asked.

“Not for the fame nor fortune”, I said. “I really don’t know. I’ve never just sat down and analyzed my reasoning. The thing is I can do it, I know that I’m the best one for the job, I have the teams, the tools and the talent, so I just go.”

“But stuff like that must be big news.” He says. 

“I hate publicity”, I said. “If I could, I’d live my life in a state of quiet anonymity. However there’s just something about these abandoned mines and their attraction they hold on people. I’d really like to go out of business tomorrow, but in the lower 48, there are over 500,000 old, discarded mines. There’s 47,000 on federal BLM lands alone.”

“Damn”, he replied.

“Indeed”, I noted back, “And I live in mine central, out in the Four Corners area. I started out just closing these old mines with explosives, but it evolved into a search and rescue *and* recovery business. There’s not many of us out there doing this any longer, so as long as I’m able, when the call comes up…”

“Damn, Sir”, the airman replied, “I salute you. I’d never go into one of those old mines, let alone go in and search for people.”

“It’s not a pretty job, nor is it in any way, shape or form safe”, I replied, “We’ve been lucky and extremely diligent. So far, we’ve had a couple of tough scrapes and near misses, but we’re all still here plugging along.”

“That’s really brave of you”, he said.

“I’m not brave”, I replied, “I stay alive by being scared to death of these fucking murderholes. The same for my crews. These old holes, well, they’re like a fucking rattlesnake, maybe docile but they can turn and fuck you up in an instant. We try to stay away from those instants.”

He got up and returned with a fresh drink. 

I thanked him and he said: “No. Thank you.”

That felt really good. The first time on this benighted trip that I felt anything but dread and foreboding. 

I look at the bulkhead and see we’re already over Texas, near Dallas. We’re schlepping along at 59,000’ at Mach 0.98.

“Sweet Zombie Jesus”, I thought, “I have got to get me one of these.”

A relatively short time later, were approaching Durango-La Plata County Airport. We’re flagged as “first in” as there’s a CH-53K “King Stallion” helicopter sitting at the end of the tarmac patiently puttering away, waiting for me. 

“I could really get used to this”, I thought covetously. 

We touch down and run over to near the idling helicopter. I shake hands with the flight and service crew, thanking them for all their kind words and work. 

“Go get’em, Rock”, one was heard to say as I stepped off the plane. 

“One way or the other. We always get our man.”, I say, thinking that ‘getting our person’ sounded just too weird. Pronouns vex me sometimes.

I wander over to the idling helicopter, the side door opens and I’m grabbed by an airman and dragged aboard the last aircraft of the day. 

I hope. 

“Sit down! Strap in!”, he commands. 

I do so and think: “What the fuck. What did I do to this character?”

There is a terse exchange of verbiage between the two in the passenger compartment and the pilots of this sturdy, noble bird. 

We lift off, do the requisite pirouette, and immediately am pushed back in my seat as the young pilot firewalls the General Electric GE38 turboshaft engine. 

We are headed generally southwards at a ridiculous clip. 

“Is there some problem of which I should know?” I asked the young airman. 

“Yeah!”, he shouts, “There’s nearly a two tons of explosives back there. We want that shit off our helicopter as soon as possible.”

“Hey”, I reply, “we’re on the same team here, Scooter. I want them off your bird as soon as possible as well.”

“Then hang tight, old man”, he snarks. “We’re going in hot.”

“Just to be clear, Scooter”, I say, “I’m a Major in the US Army Reserves, plain clothes division. Watch that ‘old man’ shit.”

“Yes, sir”, he salutes crisply. “Sorry about that. We’re not used to having all this artillery aboard. Why do you need it, if I may ask?”

I tell him of abandoned mines, rescues, Turks and Caicos, beach volleyball and human recoveries. 

I also explain that I kill these old fucking murderholes so they will never take another life. 

“That’s why I need the ordnance”, I say as I plug in a fresh cigar and look out the port side window. 

“Need a light?” He asks. 

We became fast friends after that. 

About a half hour later, I see my truck, Lulubelle and Leslie the Load Lifter. I point it out to the airman who relays it to the pilot. 

There’s really not a lot of good places to land one of these behemoth helicopters out here. 

The relief’s all jagged and disorderly, with loose flaggy rock , scrubby vegetation, plus the occasional coyote and roadrunner. But there is a wide, freshly graded road. 

I call Cletus on the phone and tell him to block off the road 200 meters in each direction from my truck, even though there’s no traffic in sight. We’ll land on the road and get Leslie the Load Lifter to help de-ordnance the chopper.  

Which is exactly what we did. 

No sooner than we touched down, Cletus is walking Leslie over to the helo. Now the problem becomes apparent: a tall load lifter and whirling chopper blades. 

“So much for touch and go, guys”, I say. “Spool’er down and we’ll unload once you’re static.”

With a trifle less enthusiasm than I’d have liked to see, they agreed.

I stood back and goggled over Lulubelle and Leslie’s new paint jobs. 

“Cletus”, I ask, “What did you do to my vehicles?”

“Well”, Cletus says, “I thought painting would be so easy after degreasing and washing the two. But that shit’s hard.”

“…and?” I demanded.

“Well”, I knew these guys from Jaurez. Car painters.” Cletus lied. 

“Automotive painters?” I exploded, “They’re taggers. My serious company vehicles look like the sides of an abandoned freight car!”

Swirls, tags, throwies and pieces! 

“Oh, my!”

“All that expensive paint!”, I hollered. “Son of a ….”

Cletus physically shrank from my protestations. He’s never seen me really pissed. 

I took off, walking around Leslie the Load Lifter and Lulubelle. I was smoking like an old steam engine. There were cumulonimbus amounts of angry cigar smoke. 

Then I thought “We don’t have time for this. I need my team, all my team, at 100%.”

I looked Lulubelle over again and gazed at the painted dozer blade with a *Rocknocker Resources* sticker up front and central.

“Yeah”, I said to no one in particular.

I walked over to Cletus. Arch had heard and come running. 

“I thought it over”, I said, “Not bad. It’s unique, I’ll give it that. Thinking on your feet and realizing you were in over your head. Good idea.”

“So”, Cletus brightened, “You really like it?”

“It’ll do”, I said aloud. “It’ll do.”

I walked a few feet more distant.

“Just don’t ever fucking do it again.” I said to no one in particular. 

With that out of the way, it was just starting to get dusky. I had Cletus remove the Army and Space Force’s donation to our little group. I sent the Up-In-The-Air-Junior-Birdmen on their way with a brace of Havanas each. 

Two other teams had shown before me. We talked about the drone flights and the recorded footage. 

“See anything?”, I asked. 

“Nothing definitive”, Edweird the drone pilot replied. 

“Well”, I said, “Spool up what you’ve shot so far. I’ll review it directly, after we sort the explosives.”

We packed the explosives on Lulubelle’s and Leslie’s trailer, along with the blasting machine and galvanometer, in the back of my truck. 

“We’ll need that no matter what.”, I said. “Let’s go take a look at the flown footage.”

Arch was flying a drone and I instructed him to hold the camera at a 45-degree angle to the ground. 

“Why should I do that, Doc?” He asked. 

“With the low sun”, I explained, “More contrast on the ground, exaggerated shadows. Easier to spot something new or out of the ordinary.”

“Gotcha, Doc”, Arch smiled, “Learn something new every day.”

“I always hope so”, I smiled back. 

We sped through the collective footage until it got too dark to fly. 

“Nothing”, I spat. “Son of a bitch. Now we’re going to be here for a while. So much for an ‘In and Out”. Get camp pitched, let’s break open the chow and the drinking light’s lit. Can’t afford any of us stumbling around in the dark”. 

I told them where to dig the pit latrines, and where to avoid pitching their tents. I myself dragged out a couple of Director’s chairs from the back of my pickup and proclaimed that here is where my home for the evening resides. 

“I’ve got to make some calls”, I told the small group. “We’re wheels up at Zero-Light 30, so don’t get too happy out here tonight. I’ll be back directly.”

I called Esme to let her and family know I made it OK back home. Everyone wished me well in our endeavors out here in the high desert. 

I called Rack and Ruin and left messages as they were probably out doing something more or less secret and probably dangerous, especially if you ask them. 

I called the local constabulary, introduced myself, and told him of my last day or so. I asked if there was any news about the missing seven boys. 

“Doctor Rock”, the sheriff replied, “Not a word. I was hoping when I saw your weird out of state phone number, you might have some news.”

“Not a thing, yet”, I said. “But mark my words, Sheriff. We’ll have news tomorrow, one way or the other.”

“I hope so”, the sheriff replied, “I’ve got some mighty distraught families here.”

“We’ll do the best we possibly can with the tools with which we have to work.” I told the Sheriff. 

“All anyone can ask”, he replied. 

I reminded him of our “No one left behind” policy and how we’ve never undermined that oath, as it were. 

“I hear you, Doctor”, he replied, “If I hear anything, you’re over by Crazy Squaw Wash, right?”

“Yes, sir”, I automatically replied. 

“Good”, he said, “If I hear anything, you’ll be the second to know.”

“Thanks”, I replied, “Appreciated.”

“Well”, I thought, “That’s enough for now. Time for a sit, a ponder, a drink and a smoke. Been a long, weird day…”

After a not terribly satisfying canned dinner, we all sat around the campfire in Crazy Squaw Central and mulled over what we were doing out here. 

Where would seven boys, or young men, I guess, go and what would they do? 

The possibilities seemed endless. 

There’s virtually no traffic out here and none of the guys we’re searching for had vehicles, so that means they’re on foot. Being on foot, they’re probably only going to make two and a half to four miles per hour. So let’s take three as an average, and that it’s now forty-odd hours since they disappeared, they could be in a circle diameter of one hundred thirty-eight miles, or an area of fifteen thousand miles square. 

“Fuck” was the general consensus. 

“Well”, I said, “Even the savviest desert dweller is not going to fuck around wandering the desert at night. We can imagine a million scenarios but until we have some more solid data, we’re just pissing in the wind.”

“OK, folks”, I announced, “Your bossman and fearless leader is bushed. I’m going to crash. Last one down, feed the fire, I don’t want any weird visitors tonight. See you first light. ‘Night all.”

“Night, Rock”, they said as our voices dissipated off into the eternal ether. 

I was feeling very, very uneasy as I began to drift off. 

It was a night filled with collapsing adits, unexpected detonations, endless falls down rocky shafts, flapping bats, premature blasts and brutal, stinking, suffocating gasses. 

Sometimes this job can be real nightmare fuel. 

Luckily, first light shown earlier than expected as there were no clouds or dust storms or evil genius’ contraptions blocking out the sun. 

I walked over to the camp and rousted everyone. Gave out chores as I wanted the drones in the air early to catch the initial breaking sun. I also wanted something other than canned Macro-Raviolis for breakfast.

And I really, really needed coffee. 

Over my second cup, I’m with Arch as we fly a grid that I designed the night before. I plug in a cigar, and offer one to Arch, just to see him retch. 

We’re flying north and south, south and north. Up and down, down and up. We have another drone in the air doing the same east-west. 

And both are not seeing a single God-damned thing out of the ordinary. 

The battery on Arch’s drone is about flat, so I tell him to orbit left and head back. 

As he does, I see something on the screen. Something out of the ordinary.

“Whoa! Whoa!”, I shout, “Orbit left! Look. There!”

“What?”, Arch asked. “Doc, I need to get back soon, nearly out of power.” 

“Then crash the damn thing!”, I said, “Get Jerry and his drone over here. NOW!”

“What’s, uh, the deal?”, Jerry from my Las Cruces crew asks. 

“LOOK!” as I point to the screen. 

“Wait a minute”, Arch finally twigs and sees what I see. Cletus walks up to see what’s all the commotion.

“That mine, right there!”, I said, “Rosalita Number 8. Remember her?”

“That’s a bat sanctuary hole, right”, Cletus asks. 

“That’s right.” I said, “One we just finished two months ago. Remember that job?”

“Holy shit”, Cletus says. “That’s where we mixed all that concrete, used them old railroad ties and rebar to shut the adit except for a small hole for bats to come and go?”

“That’s right!”, I exclaimed. 

Arch was perplexed. 

“So”, he asked. “What’s the big whoop?”

“There used to be signs. Signs on plywood. STAY OUT! STAY ALIVE! Bat Sanctuary. Rosalita Number 8. Trespassers will be prosecuted. It is a FELONY to enter this mine.” I said.

“So?” he asked again. 

“All the wood it gone.”, I exclaimed, “Every last piece. And what do idiots in abandoned mines do with wood?”

“They make fires…”, Arch and Cletus stiffened. 

“That hole is a bat sanctuary because they’ve been there for a hundred years. Tons over literal tons of guano. And loads and loads of nasty gases…” I trailed off. 

It’s nut-cuttin’ time. 

What to do? 

What to do?

“Arch? Cletus? Which of you want to take a stroll with me this bright and early morning?” I smiled like a reptile. 

“One, two, three. Ha! Rock break scissors.” Cletus beamed. 

“Arch. P-4 containment. I want every seam taped and I want positive pressure. Kent, Jerry, Elaine, you’re on ‘help the miners get dressed this morning’ duty. Let’s go, times a-wastin,” 

Kent and Jerry helped secure Arch. Elaine and Cletus helped me get suited up. 

“OK”, I said as we both re-bivouacked back at camp central. “Who here can handle Lulubelle besides Cletus?”

Jerry was licensed and a pretty good Cat Skinner. 

“OK, Jerry, you’re our chauffer. We’re not walking the two and a half miles to Rosalita Number 8 in these suits in this weather. Cletus, you follow with Leslie. Jerry, drop us off and blade a grade to bring my truck up. Once we’re done here, no matter the outcome, that mine’s going away.”

“Roger that, Doc”, Jerry said. 

“Let’s get going, time’s seriously against us.” I said as I crawled into the driver’s seat of Lulubelle. 

“Sorry, Jerry”, I said, “Old force of habit. You’re the driver. You have the conn.”

“Roger that”, he faux-saluted me. 

We clanked and clunked over some gnarly desert surfaces. Sand, flaggy rock, tumbleweeds, boulders, scrub, blowouts, you name it. 

Jerry was taking no prisoners, but Lulubelle’s pretty, newly painted blade was getting the short end of the trip. 

“That’s what she’s built for”, I said, “Fifth gear, Jer. Let’s make some tracks.”

I went over a plan map of the Rosalita Number 8 mine with Arch. It was a fairly simple design that resembled a frightened mop or the total eclipse of the sun on a stick. 

A main entrance adit and horizontal tunnel back one point two kilometers to the mezzanine, or central shaft, area. From the roundish mezzanine, there were three raises and three winzes. In other words, three tunnels extending from the central shaft going up and three extended going down. 

The mine made some money on copper and silver but was abandoned in 1919. It was then left and forgotten until I found it with all its nasty little inhabitants. 

Bats.

Bats by the billions.

I spoke up as the unofficial chairman of the group.

“Sir, we were just trying to help.”

“American?”

“Yes sir”, I replied. 

“Names and dates of birth?”

We supplied the information. 

“Wait here. Don’t touch anything.”

He departed and we sat around wondering where the bathrooms were. 

“We’re in deep shit, Rock”, Tom said. 

“Nah”, I replied. I knew what was going to happen.

“Go ahead, run our particulars. I know of a group in Virginia that’ll give him the straight dope, as it were.” I thought. 

“Rock”, Mikhail said, “You seem completely unconcerned.”

“Very observant”, I replied. 

“You know something we don’t?” He asked. 

“Most assuredly”, I replied with a snicker. 

The constable returned with a completely flummoxed look on his face. 

“You”, he addressed me. “Are” reading from his scribbled notes, “Doctor Rocknocker?”

“Yes, sir.”, I replied. 

“And these?”, pointing to the remainder. 

“Friends and family”, I replied, “We’re here on holiday, in Turtle Cove Villas.”

“You can verify your identity?”, he asked.

“Just ask anybody”, I snickered. 

Everyone in the group nodded in agreement. 

“What you’ve done is highly irregular”, he stated. 

“Par for the course”, I replied. 

“So I’ve heard.” He said. “You are actually in the US military?”

“Reserves”, I said, “Plainclothes division.”

“How many passports do you carry?”, he asked. 

“Sorry”, I replied, “That’s classified.”

“As I thought”, he said, defeated. “What am I to do with you people?”

“We really didn’t break any laws”, I replied, “and we did clear the roads for commerce here to continue.”

“Breaking and entering, theft of governmental equipment, pilfering fuel…” he began. 

“We fully intend to lock the gate when we leave, we used and returned the equipment. We performed a service free for all the island’s fine folks here as our little Christmas present…” I replied.

He shook his head.  

Mikhail walked over and put his arm around the constable. 

“See?”, he said, voice dripping with treacle, “We are so enchanted by your island, that we saw a problem, and fixed it. For free. For the people. For the greater good.”

The constable knew he had lost this argument. 

“But what am I to do with you?” he asked.

“Let us lock the gate. Then come with us over to the pub so we can buy the island’s finest lunch and a couple of holiday pints.” Tom suggested. 

He looked at the amassed crowd, all smiling idiotically and shrugging their shoulders a like “Can’t think of a better idea”.

We later returned to the villa to be greeted by some not terribly happy wives. 

I showed Esme the constable’s calling card, and said he’ll vouch for us.



I explained that we used the machines, cleared the roads, and now the island’s back in business. Besides most shops here don’t open until after 1:00 pm. So just tell Joko to call the driver and you can all go out and snag those post-holiday bargains. 

After the ladyfolk left, we all agreed we had just dodged a massive series of bullets. 

The next day was one where nothing was scheduled. No fishing, no sightseeing, no shopping. Just rest and relaxation. Basically, this was the first opportunity for these activities after our abortive beach volleyball debacle the previous night. 

Anyone over sixty and attempting to spike a volleyball should be restrained.

So, I’m puttering around the kitchen on a bright and blue morning as so often happens here when there’s no hurricane. I’m making a pot of Greenland Coffees for whoever desires a bracing eye-opener. 

Mikhail descends the stairs and asks if I know anything about the large black helicopter that’s been circulating up and down the beach. 

“Nope”, I reply, adding just a touch more Grand Marnier to the pot and handing him a coffee. “Not this time, I’m off the grid until after New Year’s.”

“Well”, he sips and gets a little more eye-widened, “I hope it’s not the IRS or other form of governmental headfolds because they’re now tearing up the volleyball pitch landing on the beach.”

“Aw, shit”, I reply as I scope the Sea King helicopter with the large THE NAVY logo emblazoned on the tail of the thing. 

“Then again, Mike”, I say, “They could be here for me. Maybe we didn’t get off so Scot-free yesterday. Let’s go find out. Grab me a cigar, will ya’?”

I fire up a morning stogie and wander out the front of the villa, toward the noisily humming helicopter now spooling down on what remains of our volleyball court. 

“What now?”, I voice lowly to no one in particular. 

“Never ask that question”, Mikhail admonishes. What I see next only goes to reinforce what he had just noted. 

The side door of the chopper opens and out pops two characters that I’d easily recognize at a thousand meters through a sniper’s scope. 

“Oh, my giddy aunt.”, I say and decide to find a chair and wait for the pair to invade our little soiree. 

“Rock?”, Jewel says, joining our little crew, “What’s all this? Who are those guys?”

“Wait one”, I say, letting the two get from the beach to the finely manicured lawn of our villa. 

By this time, the helicopter has awakened everyone in the villa and most are filing out to see what’s going on.

They march in rigid lockstep, but both will deny ever doing that, and announce their presence with a hearty “Merry Christmas, Doctor Rock and friends!” 

I turn to the massed crowd and announce, “Folks, these here are Agent Rack and Agent Ruin, late of Langley, Virginia. We’ve worked together a bit before, for decades. I have no idea what the hell they’re doing here now so far out of their native jurisdiction.”

Pleasantries were exchanged as Joko appears and asks if she should set two extra plates for breakfast. 

“Gents?”, I ask, “Hungry?”

Of course they were. Free food? 

Sheesh. Silly question.

We all shuffle into the villa and are seated at the grand dining table. 

Joko surreptitiously asks me how many others are waiting in the idling helicopter. 

“Probably four”, I reply, “Pilot, copilot, navigator and sonar operator?”

“OK, Herr Doctor”, she smiles and scurries off to the kitchen. 

“Well”, I note, “That was a bit out of the blue.”

After an elegant repast of cornmeal and banana porridge, Mangú, steamed cabbage with saltfish, ackee and saltfish with johnny cakes, pastechi, fried breadfruit, bammy with salted mackerel (mackerel rundown) and mint tea or Greenland Coffee, Agents Rack and Ruin, now sated, ask for a private intermezzo. 

I excuse myself and the Agents and go into one of the lower-floor drawing rooms and ask them the reason for the visit.

“Doc”, Agent Rack says with all the seriousness of a recent myocardial infarction, “We have a *situation*.”

Code for “the shit has once again hit the fan”. 

Time to get serious. 

“Continue”, I said. “And why me?”

“Right”, Agent Ruin took up the conversational slack, “There’s been a disappearance of seven youths, ages 12 through 19, four from the (Navajo) Nation. Last seen thirty hours ago in your neck of the woods.”

“By ‘my neck of the woods’ I assume you mean where I’ve been lately closing mines and not the city near where Es and I reside?” I reply. 

“That’s affirm”, Agent Rack replies. “These seven youths were last seen as a group”, he produces a topographic map of the Four-Corners area and circles a spot with a well-chewed pencil. 

He continues: “Heading from this settlement out into the field where you’ve been working building bat sanctuaries and closing those extraneous mines.”

“OK”, I reply, “Now I understand. Situation report update?”

“They have just disappeared”, Agent Ruin noted. “POOF! Families went out hunting and there’s been some more locals helping because of the holiday season. People home instead of working, y’know. They’ve been using dirt bikes, ATVs and even horseback, but there’s been no trace of the kids since the last sighting.”

“That’s not good”, I reply. “So, it’s all hands-on deck, as it were?”

“You’ve got clearance from the highest office”, Agent Ruin continued, “What you need will be provided. With all this illegals business, showing a bit of compassion for far-flung locals is thought to be worth the effort. Especially since most were Local Indigenous Personnel.”

“Navajos of the Diné Nation”, I replied, calling them their preferred moniker. 

“Right”, Agent Rack added. “So? How about it? You taking over?”

I look at my watch and announce that as of this time, on this date, I am taking over the search and rescue or recovery mission. 

“Times a-wastin’”, I announce. “Let me grab a few things, make a couple of calls, say *Adios* to everyone. You can figure out the best and fastest manner to transport me to New Mexico.”

“Roger that”, Agent Rack said as I stood to exit the room. 

“Give me fifteen minutes. There’s a lot of goodbyes I need to share.” I said. 

Back to the living room and I motion to Esme for a private confab. 

“Let me guess?”, Es smiles, “Disaster back home and they need you to do all the stick and rudder work?”

“Close”, I said, “Seven lost kids in the Jicarilla Bat Sanctuary area. Four from the nation and three otherwise. No sign of them for the last thirty. I have to take this one, it’s been flagged all the way to the top and between me and you, I’ve got a *real* bad feeling about all this.”

“Go”, Es commands. “Go now. Go get them and bring them back home. Don’t worry about us, we’ll manage without you.”

“That stings a bit”, I said. 

“You know what I mean”, Esme smiles in the certain way that makes me go all jellified. 

“Your skills are needed, go practice your art. And be damned careful. We’re mostly adults here, we can sort out the details. Don’t worry about us, just go and find those kids. Hell. It’s Christmas, can’t the world let up for even a few days?” Es laments.

“Evidently not”, I reply and kiss Es deeply and wish that I didn’t have to leave. I don’t want to go. First real holiday time off in years. Then this shit has to happen. 

However, duty calls. One *must* answer.

I dash upstairs to grab my bag of phones and other necessary field equipment, like cigars and emergency medicinal flasks. I trot back downstairs to distribute my goodbyes. 

“Sorry folks”, I say to the assembled crowd, “We’ll try again next year. Or maybe in June. There’s loads of birthdays and anniversaries, so mark your calendars. I need to dash, a little matter of some lost kids in my work area. Needs my special talents and those of my crews. You all have the best New Year’s you can and let’s all keep in touch. The *Casa de Rocknocker* is always open door. Please do drop by.”

A quick hug for our new grandkids, hugs, kisses and handshakes all around. Soon, I’m trotting out to the spooling up The Navy Sea King parked on our poor beach volleyball court. 

Joko appears and thrusts four bags into my hands. 

“For the helicopter crew. Shame they couldn’t join us.” She smirks slightly. 

I hug her, and she’s a little disconcerted. She’s not big on emotions or their unbridled display. 

“Joko”, I say, “Thank you so much. Please take care of them for me, they are my family.”

“And friends”, she adds. 

“Like I said”, I reply. “I’ll be back home in a few days. I’ll call to square accounts.”

“Do not worry yourself, Herr Doctor”, Joko smiles, “I know where you live. I also know what you’re doing instead of your vacation. God bless and God speed, Doctor Rock.”

“Much appreciated”, I say as Agents Rack and Ruin are grousing that I’m taking two minutes too long.

I plant myself in a rearward seat, am unceremoniously strapped in and head-phoned. I hand the bags to the Sonar Operator. 

“Breakfast for you and the crew”, I smile, “Compliments of Turks and Caicos’ best house mother ever.”

“Hey! Thanks, Doc”, he replies. 

I turn to Agents Rack and Ruin as the pilot kicks out the jams. We ascend a bit, he does a natty pirouette to make certain the way is clear, then firewalls the twin General Electric T58-GE-8B turbojet engines. We all slide back in our seats as the huge whirlybird claws it’s way through the air and off to our destination. 

The agents want to have a chat, but first, I need to mobilize my crews. 

I call Cletus and Arch back home. They pick up on the second ring and I fill them in on the problem. They will take my pickup, Lulubelle and Leslie the Load Lifter, all freshly painted, out to the coordinates the agents have provided. They’ll also set off the emergency beacon on our proprietary frequency that’ll send a phone message to our other crews. 

I tell them I need drone teams out there and start flying grids looking for trail disruption, tracks or traces of seven boisterous boys. I tell them that I just took off in a Navy helicopter and am headed back to New Mexico, but I’m still just over the Bahamas. I tell them I’ll let them know when I’m to be expected on site, as I still don’t know how I’ll be getting there. 

“Oh, yes”, I said to Cletus, “Go in my office, grab my bug-out bag and hardhat sombrero.”

He affirms that he will.

“Also”, I noted, “Make certain the animals will be taken care of while you two are gone. Fuel and water up at the Speedy Way station before you get on the road. Buy a couple of cases of beer for hydration, vodka and bourbon for medicinal purposes. Use the corporate card and get some easy chow. I don’t think we’re going to be making camp for long.”

However, I could be completely wrong. 

“OK”, I say into the cellphone telephone device, “See you in about…”, I look to the agents and they flash me a sign, “…seven or eight hours.”

“Roger that, Rock”, Cletus said, “We’re green.”

“That’s affirm”, I reply and hang up. 

“So, gentlemen”, I ask, “What’s the plan?”

“OK, Herr Doctor”, Agent Ruin chuckles. 

I groan audibly. 

“We’re here”, as he points to a map on the bulkhead of the helo. “We need to refuel before we hit Miami. We’ve got a Zumwalt-class destroyer sitting off Cuba that can take us and feed the bird.”

“That’s going to be interesting.” I remarked. 

“Coming from you”, Agent Rack chuckles, “That could spell real danger.”

I exhale audibly as I shake my head. I plug in a new oscuro Monte Cristo #7 that I had bought in the Providenciales International Airport upon arrival. 

“No smoking”, Agent Rack notes. 

“Is it lit?” I ask. 

“Anyways”, Agent Ruin continues, “We’ll fly you to Miami. There’s a Gulfstream G700 being broken out of mothballs and will be waiting for you. You’ll fly on that to Durango, Colorado. We’re using a Gulfstream because it will fly at 68,000 feet and hit Mach 0.99.”

“Holy shit”, I remarked, “Someone’s finally on the ol’ governmental ball.”

“Yes”, Agent Ruin, chuckled, “The Army General who is assigned this plane was a bit ratty about it. But once explained that it was for humanitarian purposes, he gladly acquiesced.”

“I’ll bet”, I chuckled back, “Don’t like it? Tough shit.”

“Or words to that effect”, both agents chuckled. 

“Then what?” I asked. 

“We’ve arranged an CH-53K to meet you in Durango.  It’s from Schriever Space Force Base up in Colorado Springs. They’ll fly you to the field area. Total time elapsed, some seven plus hours.” Agent Ruin explained.

“Gentlemen”, I say, “I am impressed. However, there’s one little problem we still need to handle.”

“Well”, I reply, “I’ve got my teams and most tools headed to the field. What I don’t have is ordnance. Neither Cletus nor Arch are licensed to transport the stuff and besides, I still have the keys for my shed out back.”

Agent Ruin produces a notepad and asks me what I need.

Ever hear the expression: “Kid in a candy store?”

More like “Giving Dracula the keys to the blood bank.”

“Well”, I drawled, “I’ll need a whole lot of C-4, a spool or two of Primacord, a couple-three cases of Herculene 70% Ultra Fast, twenty canisters of Seismogel, a few gallons of No Shok Nitro, a couple of boxes of blasting caps, a couple boxes of millisecond-delay superboosters and, ah, yeah, a blasting machine and galvanometer. Oh, and any binaries you have lying around and det cord. Lots of det cord, and a couple boxes of initiators and radio detonators.”

“Really, Herr Doctor?”, Agent Rack asks. 

“Hell”, I protest, “You asked. Besides, I don’t think there are many shops out in the Four Corners area that can supply and deliver any of this. We’re on a humanitarian mission, ‘a mission from God’, if I can quote Jake and Elwood.”

“OK”, Agent Ruin sighs, “I’ll have the whole list sent out to Colorado Springs. We should know by the time we hit Miami what they will have available.”

“Fair dinkum”, I say and sit back to enjoy my unlit cigar. 

A while later, we’re coming in hot and circling the damned strangest looking boat I’ve ever seen. All weird angles and black and gray paint. No windows, or so it seems. We circle a couple of times as a sailor appears as does a large “X” on the deck of the beast. 

Five minutes later, we’re all being hustled off the helicopter as the bird receives its service. It’s swarmed by sailors, all with specific jobs to do. 

Rack, Ruin and I are led to the bridge to have a say howdy with the driver of this boat. 

Agent Rack tells me to lose the cigar. I just smile back and ask a passing sailor for a light. 

“Why must you always be difficult?”, Agent Ruin asks. 

“You’ve *never* seen me being really difficult”, I smile back and tuck the never-lit cigar in my shirt pocket. 

We jog up a series of stairs and are allowed onto the bridge. 

The captain of the boat, one Darterrius Boone greeted us. 

“This isn’t a boat”, I said, goggling around at all the nifty high-tech gizmos, “This is the Starship Enterprise.”

The captain smiles broadly and says that they need tall these electronic toys for the cat-and-mouse games they’re playing with the drug cartels and for human trafficking interdiction. 

We spend about ten minutes chatting about this, that and the other thing, when a sailor reports that our bird has been fed and washed. We’re ready to depart anytime. 

We say our goodbyes and hustle back to the Sea King. We’re headed Miami bound in a scant three minutes. 

“Doctor?”, Agent Rack asks. 

“Yes?”, I answer.

“Your passport please”, He requests.

I hand it over and he produces a stamp. He whacks my beleaguered passport a couple of times. 

“Welcome to the USA”, he smiles as he hands me back my documents. 

“Well, now”, I smirk, “That’s certainly efficient.”

“We have our moments”, they both grinned back at me.

I initially was looking at the Lelit Anna, but then was leaning towards the Bambino Plus for the auto milk steaming option - as she's new to espresso machines I didn't want to overwhelm her with too much to learn, so the auto milk function seemed like a nice feature. She will typically drink one coffee drink per day, occasionally we will be entertaining and may have a need to pull multiple shots in one go.

“You’ve got the compressor here, Eastwood Concours Pro Paint and Detail Guns, there’s a sink for non-water cleaning, a kerosene parts washer, a GOOP dispenser for cleaning human tissue of automotive paint, plus all the bits and bobs you’ll need for this little task.” I noted. 

“Packer’s colors?”, Cletus snickered. 

“Yep”, I said. “All for a bit of nostalgia.”

“And you’re leaving us to fill in the details?”, Arch asked. 

“But, of course”, I said, “Doesn’t have to be a Picasso, but I’m trusting you all will do a fine and clean job. Leaving the details to your discretion, but I want those vehicles to advertise our company and be instantly noticeable in the field. I ‘ve had decals made for our equipment. I’d like them placed at an eye-grabbing location on the machines.”

I should have never mentioned Picasso. 

“Yes, bossman”, they both replied. 

With that done, I told them to pull out my truck with Lulubelle and put Es’ Deep Purple on the side of the house, under the carport. How they’ll maneuver Leslie the Load Lifter is up to their imagination.

“Now, I want you to work with extra care.”, I warned, “I don’t want a gold and green garage, although I do have several industrial fans and positive-plenum air flow in there. Please exercise utmost care, as I don’t want green and gold neighbors either.”

“Yes, bossman”, Cletus rather mechanically replied. 

“Cletus?”, I asked, “Still here? We green?”

“Oh, um, sorry Rock”, he instantly replied. “Just thinking how best to do all this.”

“Fine”, I replied, “Good man. I trust you and Arch. Don’t consider that your job hangs in the balance of how you do, just have some fun with it…”

I’ll regret that statement as well. 

“Roger that!”, Arch pipes up. “No worries, Doc. We’ll handle it so you don’t have to worry a bit.”

I shook my head in agreement. I had no real other choice. We needed to get to the airport and begin our long-awaited and anticipated family reunion and Christmas holiday. 

A bit later, Es and I are picked up by the limo I had contracted to take us to Durango Airport. From there, we were off to Denver, and a bit of a layover. Then off to Miami, a bit more of a layover, then the brief hop to Providenciales International Airport.

As we’re trundling down the jetway in Turks and Caicos, I am heard to mutter “What a bloody, fucking nightmare that was…”

“Oh, now Rock”, Es consoles, “It wasn’t that bad. I mean we did get the free upgrade to First Class…”

“Oh, about that”, I grimaced. “I spent a bunch of frequent flyer miles to upgrade us. Even Business Class gives me a pain in the back with the hours spent sitting.”

“Well”, Es grins widely, “We’re here, the kids are either here or on their way. You can spend your days lying in the sun, fishing, or doing fuck all. For once, we’re on a real holiday. I’ve packed your cell phone telephones and carefully removed the batteries until after Christmas. The rest of the world can go hang. It’s our holiday now.”

“Yeah”, I brightened. “I like that and love you. Fucking-A, Bubba. The world can just wait until *I* decide to return.”

Esme smiled that sort of smile that would melt large portions of Siberia and I grinned like a slightly more grizzled and primal Chesire Cat. I wandered over to the nearest bar, ordered a couple of tropical libations and hired a couple of locals to fetch our luggage. 

“Aren’t you afraid they’ll abscond with our luggage?” Es asked while sipping her Tiki drink.

“Nope”, I smiled, “I gave them each half a Benjamin. They want the rest of the bill; they’ll return with our bags. Old ‘fuckabout in Russia’ trick.”

“Clever, Doctor Rock”, Esme smiled and continued with her Tiki drink. 

They did in fact return with our bags and we walked with them to the ground transportation section of the airport. True to form, Joko has a ride waiting for us. I repatriated the severed Benjamins as I had promised to our luggage luggers and they were so pleased that they helped the driver load the baggage into our limousine.

We had a slightly harrowing 15-minute ride to the *Villa de Rocknocker*, which is what the locals had dubbed it since my companies had started renting the domicile. 

Es and I emerge from the vehicle and instantly there are four nattily dressed local guys, all about 18-23 years of age or so. They attacked the limo to retrieve our bags and the other two valets handed Es a tall cold drink and myself an even larger one. 

Sipping cautiously, never know when they’ll try and slip in some light white rum in lieu of vodka. But no; it was a frosty, limey, glacial, and fruity collation that scored highest marks. 

“I could certainly get to like this method of living”, I smiled deliriously at Esme. “Although, I know this little soiree is going to cost my company a fortune.”

“Partially tax deductible”, Esme replies, “Add in advertising revenue and word of mouth, and it’ll all be good.”

“But, of course”, I replied, vowing to say nothing about costs while we’re here on holiday with our far-flung family and friends. 

“Stuff it”, I said, thinking of stinking abandoned mines and body recoveries, “We’re all on holiday, it’s Christmas and we’re going to have a time that will be recorded in the annals of You-Bet-Your-Ass-We’re-On-Vacation Quarterly.”

“That’s the spirit”, Es replies, “Just promise me one thing: that you’ll still be ambulatory for midnight mass Christmas Eve.”

“But of course”, I replied, fingers firmly crossed behind my back. 

Es had scouted the islands and found that Our Lady of Divine Providence church was where she wanted to go on Christmas Eve. It was only one and a half kilometers from where we were now standing, and had the requisite Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. I am, of course, no longer Catholic. I used to be, but I got better. However, Esme has earned so many Brownie Points in putting up with me for the last forty-five years, the last thing I could do is be so callous and hard-hearted to deny her the highlight of the season. 

Christmas is Esme’s favorite holiday, season, and time of year. Sure, I spent buckets of cash bringing our expanding and far-flung family and friends here for the holiday, but this is just frosting on the proverbial Christmas Cake. 

Besides, she’s allowing all the collected menfolk to go deep-sea fishing on Boxing Day. She knows that it’s going to be an ethanol-soaked aqueous Bacchanal so I really have no other choice. 

Our luggage disappeared into the bowels of the villa. We stroll in to be greeted by Daughters Number One and Two, their husbands or significant others, as well as our newly minted twin grandchildren. 

And there was much rejoicing. 

Joko arrives and asks a few select questions about storing our clothing in the en-suite walk-in closets, such should they be hung up by color or activity? She asks about an update on our friends arrivals, harrumphs slightly when I admit I have no idea when they’re supposed to arrive.

“Well, Herr Doctor”, which is what she likes to call me, “We shall just go ahead with hors d'oeuvres then. We will soon have an assortment provided consisting of conch salad, conch fritters, cracked conch, ceviche made with local fish, and Caribbean shrimp cocktail with mango, banana, and papaya. As per your orders, we will also be providing bar-be-qued fruit skewers, cheese and plantain chips, mini crab cakes, coconut shrimp, jerk chicken skewers and parsnip-wrapped *Devils on horseback* (A vegetarian appetizer made with soy sauce, smoked paprika, and smoked almonds -ed.).”

The vegetarian chow was a bow to Esme’s oldest friend, a Greek-American national who’s married to Tom, a one-time coworker and failed paramour. Jewel by name, she is a sometimes pain-in-the-ass vegan. But more often, we’ll just pump her full of Ouzo, Agiorgitiko, Mavrodaphne, Xinomavro and she’ll demolish a blue porterhouse with all the carnivorous trimmings. 

Our other soon-to-be houseguests are Mikhail, my oldest and dearest friend, who is surprisingly not Russian, but American as apple pie and napalm. We go back over 60 years as we both attended the Roosevelt Street Kindergarten all those decades ago. He’s stayed more or less put in SE Baja Canada as I went out and traveled the world, several times. A high school graduate who wastes no time calling me “College boy” and other defamatory verbal attempts. I laugh and promise to write him some scurrilous X-rated prescriptions as I do hold both a PhD and DSc and am a doctor of some repute. 

He owns and runs the most highly sought after automotive and motorcycle speed shop in the quad-state area. He has a permanent placard for his philanthropy and his company’s efforts for the common man at the Great Lakes Dragaway (*not* Dragway) in Union Grove, Wisconsin. 

Visually, I swear, he most closely resembles a frightened, aging Jesus whose death sentence has just been commuted to life imprisonment with no hope of parole. 

He hates it when I remind him of that fact. In fact, it looks like Jesus has put on a few kilos, but who am I to say anything? 

Long hair, pony-tail and full beard. 

Brothers from other mothers. 

He’s married, for nearly as long as Es and me, to Susanne. A real southern belle, but in asking her of her background, she’ll claim to be a southern ding-dong. 

She’s southern as a gourd dipper, speaks the plain truth and calls a spade a fucking shovel. Sugar coating is unknown with her, unless she’s baking and producing her world-class desserts such as pecan, shoo-fly, and chess pie. She drinks, smokes, and loves to play poker with the boys. I am afraid that I did request a full poker set of chips be available for quiet nights around the fire pit overlooking the Caribbean Sea. 

They were unable to have children for reasons never asked nor divulged. They have been Godparents and doters on both our children and grandchildren. 

As Hawkeye Pierce would say, “Finest kind”. 

Damned thing is that I invited Toivo and his brood down as well. I figured he’d leap at the prospect of free feeding and lounging around the Caribbean like peripatetic leeches, intent on an orgy of freeloading that would make a lamprey look like a piker. 

But no. It seems that duty has called and he’s overwhelmed by the number of those eyesore electrical windmill bastards that must come down. 

I jocularly asked about the environmental friendliness of those fucking bird-choppers. 

""These bastards have a twelve-foot-thick concrete foundation that covers over a third of an acre. They’re over four hundred feet tall. A simple two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tons of steel requiring 170 tons of coking coal and 300 tons of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. You have any idea how much diesel will have to burn to mix that much concrete or make that steel and haul this shit out here and put it together with a 450-foot crane? You want to guess how much oil it takes to lubricate that fucking thing? Or winterize it? In its 20-year lifespan, it won’t come close to offsetting the carbon footprint of making it. Nor will it even come close to paying for itself. If it wasn’t for massive government subsidies, ‘wind farms’ would be as oxymoronic as ‘Government intelligence’."" Toivo fumed. 

Toivo is nothing if not eloquent. 

And busier than a one-legged man at an ass-kicking contest. 

“Well”, I sigh, “There’s always next year. Drop by New Mexico whenever you take to the hankering for a cold one, a cigar, and some down time.”

“Rock”, Toivo said earnestly, “I guarantee you that we will.”

He rang off and I felt a sudden chill. 

Little did I know…

Christmas was near upon us and besides all that usual seasonal folderol, it’d be the grandkids first Yuletide. Everyone was in the holiday spirit in the villa, where tidings of joy and good will towards men flowed like the treacly sentiments they were; only to be captured, distilled into rum and thus toasted with rum punch and other high-octane beverages. 

Of course, there was the usual sexual schism in the villa. 

All the womenfolk wanted to go shopping and sightseeing. 

All the menfolk wanted to stay home, watch the UEFA Europa League, drink, play poker, drink, smoke cigars and drink. 

However, there were twin and newly minted grandchildren about, so that also had to be factored into the equation. 

The women all went shopping and sightseeing. 

The men stayed home with the new kids on the block. 

The men also called Joko to arrange a brace of nannies for the new tykes. 

The men were, and I quote, “Swine” as described by the women when they returned. They discovered a heated poker game in the parlor with the nannies upstairs watching over the young’uns. 

No harm, no foul. But there was absolutely no grousing by the guys over the gals shopping tallies. 

I mean, hell, it’s Christmas. 

We all had a Christmas dinner that couldn’t be beat. It consisted of openers with saltfish fritters, Jamaican patties, Trinidadian doubles, and fried dumpling. Side dishes included Jamaican hard food like green banana, yam, plantain, cassava and breadfruit. Mains included roasted turkey, curry goat, jerk chicken, escovitch fish and jerk pork. Desserts included home-churned exotic tropical fruit sorbets and ices, Caribbean black cake (also known as fruit cake or rum cake). There’s also coconut drops from and sweet potato pudding.

Bloated to near critical mass, we all retired to the living/drawing room and immediately passed out, snuffling and snoring. 

A rude awakening a few hours later as we were informed that Midnight Mass was on tap as “we had promised”. Midnight Mass typically begins just before Christmas Day starts at midnight. It was a quiet, but poignant service, recalling the birth of Jesus - whom Christians regard as the world's true king - born in the wee small hours, in a provincial backwater of first century Judea. 

Seemingly appropriate in this particular beach and sand dune venue. 

We all returned and exchanged gifts. There was a lot of strung molluscan concretions, auriferous and argentiferous baubles as well as a vintage Soviet-made shortwave radio that were exchanged. 

I received the radio and I feel I made out the best of all the Xmasian exchanges. 

Mikhail received a bottle of Macallan 18-Year-Old Sherry Oak Whisky of which we all helped him sample this ware and give our impressions. My cigar stash took some ferocious hits, but luckily Joko had “an uncle that worked in the cigar trade”. She assured me she could provide me, for a price of course, an endless supply of stogies. 

I did and she did as well. Those were some fine smokes. 

Time and tide rolled on. I had to remind everybody that we had to sober up as all us guys were off deep sea fishing the next day. 

There was little rejoicing. 

The next morning, Boxing Day to the Brits, all of us guy fellers were deposited by cab at the docks in Providenciales. We had contracted with “Wahooters” fishing charters for the full day treatment. They provided a 48’ Bertram offshore fisher, sort of like the USS Minnow of Gilligan’s Island fame, but with fewer holes. We’re off for nine solid hours, going after Barracuda, Cero Mackerel, and Mahi Mahi, Amberjack, Wahoo, and King Mackerel. 

We selected a 9-hour trip, so we embarked an hour earlier than those other bourgeoisie linewetters and went to sites rarely fished towards West Caicos. We headed to the western side of Providenciales and turned south along the reef. This is where we started to troll for the big fish. We headed to West Caicos and fished the southwest bank where the tidal currents bring nutrients from the deep that attract BIG fish. Only the larger Deep Sea Fishing boats like ours could go there.

A full gourmet lunch was served on board, with water, soda, light beer, and all the fishing goodness.

Nearly a deal killer on the light beer thing, but cooler heads prevailed and we had six cases of Mexican lager delivered before departure. 

Our captain was a local Caribbean denizen, a punster and great practical joker, by the name of Kordal Nembhard. We had two deckhands, named Kasen Slaughter and Treshaun Creighton, Jamaicans all. They knew they had a boatload of landlubbers once my son-in-law slipped on the dock and slid headfirst into the boat. 

Of course, we were polite enough not to snicker. 

We roared with laughter instead.

After a brief shakedown, we fished and fished until our fishers were sore. 

We caught more fish on that one trip that I think our entire lives, collectively. We actually got tired of catching fish. Mikhail, for some reason, couldn’t catch anything but Mahi Mahi. We’re all catching groupers, sharks, tuna and the like, but he just kept dragging in huge Dorado after huge Dorado. 

We’ll eat well tonight. The crew will fillet and ice our catches for us before we finish our trip. 

I tied onto a massive marlin that really put the hurt back into my lower back and shoulders. He fought for over two hours. We saw him jump a couple of times, and the captain of the boat swore the fish weighed over seven hundred pounds. 

If he didn’t know his fish, who would?

However, alas, this time the fish won. He broke off or threw the hook. We would have released him if we ever managed to get him to the boat. But still, it’d been nice seeing the beast up close. 

We caught tuna until our arms ached. There were wahoo boated as well as kingfish. We decked Nassau grouper, red snapper, mutton snapper, gray snapper, yellowtail, horse-eye jack, permit, and barracuda. 

After seven hours, I threw in the towel. I retired to the flying bridge with beer and cigar in hand to help Captain Kordal navigate. The bridge provided a spectacular view of the calm, blue sea. The bloody seagulls, knowing that leftover bait and the occasional overboard spew, provided their daily sustenance, wouldn’t leave us alone. They were brazen and sneaky, landing near the live wells while we were otherwise occupied, only to duck into them and snatch a beak-full of cigar minnows before skedaddling. 

We returned to the port and called a cab to take us and our catch back to the villa. Of course, we tipped the boat hands handsomely. So much so, they told us of more impromptu offshore outings, with their uncles and cousins.

We were hung down, brung down, sun and wind burned and in ridiculously cordial spirits. We said we might take them up on the offer, but for now, it’s back to base to ice our catch and take long soaks in the Jacuzzi or shower. 

Joko had the cooks prepare ceviche, for our dinnertime *amuse-bouche*. We all dined on charcoal grilled Mahi Mahi, smoked barracuda, and baked grouper. There were the inevitable Caribbean accompaniments followed by gelato and ices, all homemade. 

After dining, we all returned to the beach to watch the sun go down, the moon rise and for the men to regale the bored womenfolk of our manly exploits that day. 

We were all snoring in the deckchairs within an hour. 

The wind came up, fresh off the sea and Joko roused the slumbering crew. We had to get inside and close off all the windows as these usually led to dust and sandstorms the likes of which were rarely seen by Alexander the Great.

The next morning, over Greenland coffee and New Orleans beignets, the discussion turned to what we all had planned for the day. 

None of them involved just staying at the villa and mooching around the place. No, there was shopping, sightseeing and events to be visited. 

However, Joko arrived and said that none of that was going to happen today. Seems the roads had been sand-locked by the blowing and drifting Caribbean carbonate clastics from last night’s blow. 

I asked her if the island didn’t have some sort of municipal crews to go out and correct these slightly trifling matters. 

“Oh, Herr Doctor”, she explained, “Typically there are such crews, but the time here between Christmas and New Year’s was one of rest, relaxation and buggering off.”

“But they do have a municipal department with the machines to correct these problems, correct?” I asked. 

“Of course”, she explained further, “But there’s no one to drive the equipment.”

I smiled crookedly. 

“Gentlemen”, I said, “Put on your work clothes. We have some roads to clear.”

The municipal department was only a fifteen-minute walk from the villa. Tom, Mikhail, my son-in-law and myself arrived. We were looking at the chain-link enclosure which was guarded by a heavy, sliver padlock and stout chain. 

“Well”, Tom asked, “Now what, Herr Doctor?”

“Mikhail”, I said, “Time to impress your villa-mates.”

Mikhail smiled and produced a small leather roll-up. There were an assortment of little metal devices nestled within. He selected two of them and attacked the padlock. 

Covered in sand and probably filled with is as well. The lock protested but popped open in less than thirty seconds. 

Mikhail chuckled, “Puny lock”. 

We removed the chain and swung open the gates. 

There they were. The machines that were to mark the day. 

I called dibs on the Caterpillar 140 Motor Grader, and Mikhail opted for the T-86 tracked Bobcat with 81” angle broom. We promised my son-in-law and Tom that they could go in for Round 2 as we’re not terribly certain just how much road needed clearing. 

Both machines were left with the keys in them, as this proved convenient. However, we came up against what at first looked like a deal killer.

Both machines were nearly out of gas. 

Leave it to Tom and Mikhail again as they popped the lock from the lone gas pump in the enclosure. My ever so handy son-in-law found the outdoor electrical box and popped the circuit for the pump. Both were petrol, not diesel, powered, we made certain of that fact. 

Gassed up and ready to go, I told Mikhail to follow me and clear off what the big grader missed. I didn’t want to chance scraping the road too closely, for fear of removing the asphalt as well as the offending debris.  

We fired up the vehicles and took a moment to get acquainted with the controls. We pulled slowly out onto the roads that were uncharacteristically devoid of traffic. 

It took me a few minutes, but the grader was a machine designed much like Lulubelle back home. Instead of a frontal blade, it sported one amidships. 

“Easy peasy”, I chortled as I revved the machine up to a blistering three point six miles per hour. 

Up and down Blue Hills Road, past the airport and back again. We handled the western portion of the Leeward Highway handily, and down South Dock Road to South Chalk Key. There really wasn’t that much windblown sand, but there were areas with some impressive carbonate sand drifts. The grader pushed that stuff aside and the broom swept the roads clear as the day they were first lain.

After an hour and a half or so, we returned to the lot, refueled and swapped drivers. Tom took the grader, as he was a cat skinner from way back. My son-in-law manned the Bobcat. They headed east and cleared the eastern portion of the Leeward Highway and Lower Bight Roads. They cleared the Governor’s Road, Bristol Hills and Turtle Key roads. 

In the interim, Mikhail and I found a local pub, Bugaloo’s Conch Crawl, that was open. We proceeded to partake of the British tradition of a couple of pints and a few bags of scratchings. We also found, and sampled, the Turks and Caicos one locally brewed beer: Turk’s Head. It’s brewed in four beer variants: lager, light lager, amber, and IPA. 

Of course, we had to sample all four. 

For science. 

Plus, we also discovered the locally produced Bambarra Rum and Osprey Vodka. 

Mikhail sampled the rum, while I opted for the vodka. 

Big surprise there. 

We heard the big Cat grader and little Bobcat broomer chugging up the road. We paid up, tipping the owner and barmaids handsomely. We sallied forth, fortified with the notion that we’d done a great service for the local populace of our recent stay.

The constable who greeted us back at the municipal lot didn’t share our sentiments. 

We parked the machines and were told by the constable to gather in the municipal office. 

He waivered between being exceptionally stern and silently chuckling. 

“OK, guys”, he said sternly, “What’s the big idea?”

Just downloaded bumble a week ago and had a decent convo with a guy so I agreed to meet for coffee the next day. I just couldn’t tell if it was me being awkward or if he didn’t like how I looked in person. The convo was pretty surface level but still not bad in my opinion but I don’t know because I don’t talk to men much. He was talking when the barista came to tell us that the cafe is closed. He immediately got up and started putting his coat on and said nothing. When we got outside I said I had a nice time and he rushed off not saying much. He didn’t ask for my number or anything and I didn’t get a text for a few hours so I messaged that it was nice to meet you and to let me know if you want to meet again- still no text after a couple of hours and so I unmatched. Also had to delete the app because I can’t take anymore of these rejections.

I don’t really know what I’m looking for advice on but it was just very discouraging because it’s the first time I actually went on a “date” and he seemed like a decent guy too so it hurts to wonder what he thought about me to leave like that. ",1,1739561510.0,Bumble,2,1.0,False
1ipit03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rocknocker/comments/1ipit03/so_how_were_your_holidays_part_1/,"So, how were your holidays? Part 1.","“Es, Holy wow! Calm down”, I say over the phone. “I’m finished with my Power Squadron down here in Galveston. Now, what’s the problem?”

“The problem is that there’s a reefer semi-truck parked outside”, she calmly exploded, “That has over a hundred honey-glazed hams, smoked turkeys, and other assorted items that they say you ordered.”

“I did order them”, I replied, “I order them every year for my employees. Every year, they get a bonus check and their choice of a smoked ham, smoked turkey, natural ham, natural turkey and for the vegans in my employ, a whole smoked turducken.”

“Oh, yes”, Es replies, “but these bozos want to deliver the whole order here.”

“Ah!”, I reply, “And therein lies the problem. Evidently, trying a new delivery company wasn’t such a good idea. Put the head bozo on the line, please.”

“Hello?” I hear a new voice. 

“Yeah”, I replied, “Listen up. I had my company administrator, i.e., my wife, place a rather large order to be delivered before the holidays. You were sent an Excel spreadsheet with the addresses, contact info and assorted information so that my employees would receive their annual bonus before the holidays. So why in the name of all that’s fermented are you at my home trying to make a delivery?”

“Well”, came the half-hearted response, “This is what I was told to do.”

“OK”, I said, “By whom?”

“My boss”, he replied. 

“Groovy”, I counter, “Put him on the line.”

“He’s not here”, the driver reports. 

“Then”, I say in a most exasperated manner, “Give me HIS phone number.”

“I don’t think”, whereupon I instantly agreed, “That I have it.”

Checking my cellphone telephone device, I noted that I did have the number in storage from when Es and I made the initial order. 

“Here’s an order I think you can follow”, I barked, “Do nothing. Sit in your truck and do nothing until you hear from me or your boss. Got that, Scooter?”

“That’s not my name”, he grumpily replied. 

“Your name will be ‘Mud’ if you do so much as move a single centimeter”, I said. “I’m calling your boss. Wait until you hear from him or me.”

“OK”, he relies *sotto voce*. 

“Meathead”, I mutter, “Let’s see. Super-Fine A+ Shipping…”

The phone rang and rang to be picked up on the fifteenth ring or so. 

“Yes?”, a disembodied voice responded. 

“This is Dr. Rocknocker out of New Mexico. I paid your firm a load of cash to deliver my employee’s holiday bonus. However, there’s now a reefer truck sitting outside my residence with all the bonus birds and hams. What the fuck gives?”

“Who is this?” the voice asked.

I mentioned my name again and once again informed them that I was getting a bit more than peeved at their lack of service. 

“Well”, the voice continued, “We’ve got your manifest and your address so we delivered it like it says.”

“Look again, this time a bit more closely”, I said, “Notice the 105 names and addresses that accompanied the order via a well-drawn spreadsheet.”

I hear paper being unfolded for the very first time. 

“Oh, my”, the voice said. 

“Yeah”, I replied a bit more icily, “’Oh, my’, my fucking giddy aunt.” 

“Looks like there was a bit of an error”, the voice continued.

“Looks like I’m going to have to visit Pigsknuckle, Arkansas”, I said, “And kick some well-deserved ass.”

“Oh, sir”, the voice continued, “There’s no need for that.”

“Oh, yes there is”, I spat back as a reply, “I spent some serious coin with your firm to have a relatively simple order executed. Now it’s 5 days before Christmas, and I’ve got a load of meat sitting in my front yard rather than being delivered around the USA and Canada.”

“Well, sir”, the voice continues, “What would you like us to do?”

“How about your FUCKING JOBS?”, I yelled. “Do what I contracted with you to do and in the time frame which was agreed upon by both parties.” How about that?”

“Well, sir”, the voice continued, “There’s no need to get nasty.”

“Oh, the fuck there isn’t”, I said, grinding my teeth in frustration, “Over 105 reasons for me to be seriously pissed off.”

“Well, sir”, the voice continued, “If you don’t tone down your language, I’m just going to hang up.”

“You do that”, I sneered. “And I’ll have the oilwell service dudes closest to your shop pay you a visit. You’ll recognize their colors and large, noisy Harley Davidson motorcycles. See? Their families love Christmas ham and turkey and when I tell them they won’t be getting this year’s bonus because some cloistered bumble-fuck in Pigsknuckle, Arkansas fucked up the delivery, they’re not going to be terribly happy.”

The voice on the other end of the line was silent, but I could hear him unfolding and rifling the papers of the spreadsheet as he looked for people closest to Arkansas.

“Yeah”, I said, “They are some of my most loyal workers and when I inform them that you and your Arkansas company fucked up their Christmas orders, well, I’m just glad I’m in New Mexico…” 

“Well, sir”, the voice shakily said, “I apologize. Let me make this right.”

“Very well”, I replied, “Now we’re both on the same page. You have the list, and you know what to order. Get this stuff delivered as per our agreement and I’ll keep the wolves at bay. If not, I’ll be riding the lead motorcycle when we come for a visit…”

“I’ll have to re-order everything”, the voice replied, “To keep to your time frame, I can’t wait for our original shipment to return.”

“That’s an ‘SEP’”, I responded, “’Someone Else’s Problem’, not mine.”

“Even if I get the truck back,” the voice continued, “We would have to destroy the first shipment, as custom orders cannot be returned. Nor can drivers be on the road for extended hours when delivering foodstuffs.”

“Tell you what I’m going to do”, I said. “I’ll take as much as our freezers can hold. I’ll have my wife call our friends and neighbors in town to help with the rest.”

“But then that means…” the voice clamored. 

“That you eat the cost of the first shipment”, I responded, “The first shipment that I paid for, that you fucked up and I was going to sue your ass into oblivion over. However, you do this, you get your truck back faster and you can finally fulfill my order.” 

Utter silence over the phone. 

“Hello?”, I cheerfully said over the rap rod. “Anyone home?”

“Yes. Sir”, the voice replied through clenched teeth. “Very well. Go ahead with your plan. In the meantime, I’ll have all reordered and sent via various carriers for delivery. This will cost me a fortune…”

“And that, again, is not my problem”, I recalled. “If you did your job as advertised, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation. So, the clock’s ticking, and you had better fulfill our contract or you will be hearing from Rocknocker Resources. Llc. league of litigation-loving lawyers.”

“Yes, sir”, said the voice on the other end of the line before I heard a nasty <CLICK>.

“Awful jackass”, I replied to the silent phone. 

I called Es back and told her about my little plan. I also had her gin up a two-line note to all in my employ that consumable Christmas bonuses might be a day or two late. Their bonus checks were already in-hand so no one was going to get too vexed and ratty over a late ham or turkey. 

I had a day or two left in Galveston after my Power Squadron training and testing to find an applicable boat to rent for the extended family to travel to the Turks and Caicos Islands for the holidays. Rocknocker Resources Llc. had procured an eight-bedroom villa, on the water, rented for just such activities. 

So, after a hearty repast of local seafood and Bloody Mary’s at Gaidos on the Seawall, I sallied forth in search of a suitable craft that would ferry friends and family from Galveston to Cockburn Town in Turks and Caicos. 

I had no sooner sat in my rental car than my phone rang. 

It was Es. 

“Yes, dear?”, I said. 

“Change of plans, Rock”, Esme informed me. 

“What’s the deal?” I asked. 

Seems my eldest, with her retinue of newly minted twins, decided that even if we were renting the Queen Mary, that six-month old twin boys and longish nautical adventures just don’t mix well. 

“Well”, Es continues, “They’re teething and cranky as all get out.”

“OK”, I said, peevishly, “They can still fly, can’t they? It’s just a short hop from Texas to Turks.” 

“That’s what she suggested”, Es noted, “So, should I revamp the schedule and get flight tickets for everyone?”

“Damn”, I replied, “I really wanted to drive there. I did the Power Squadron thing and came in tops in my class. However, I can see her side of the issue. Go ahead, get the tickets for all concerned. Use the company card so I can glom the frequent flyer miles.”

“OK, Rock”, Es brightened, “So, are you coming home soon?” 

“Yeah”, I replied, “I’ll just drive this rental back. No use getting a room and waiting on a flight. It’s just about 1100 miles. See you in seventeen or so hours.”

“OK”, Es replies, “I’ll handle the logistics from this end. Drive carefully.”

“As always”, I replied and stopped at the first package store for a cold twelve pack of Shiner Bock and a couple of local cigars. 

“Abilene to Clovis to Albuquerque, oh my.” I thought out loud as I settled into the middle lane, punched the rental to 85 mph and settled in for the long, boring trip back. 

In the meantime, Es procured tickets for our girls, their husbands or significant others and children. Besides immediate family, we were to be joined by Mikhail and Susanne, my oldest and dearest friends. Also, we were to be joined by Tom and Jewel, Es’ closest and dearest friends. 

My company had a long-term rental on a villa near Providenciales and it was used for wooing potential clients and rewarding exceptional workers. It was situated right on the water and possesses eight bedrooms, all with *en suite* facilities. 

The homestead here, as it’s a rental and used sporadically, it is lorded over by Joko, the home Majordomo. While my company rents the villa and uses it around the year, Joko is the hookin’ bull on the property. I tell her when and who will be using the villa and she takes care of everything from pick-ups at the airport to staffing at the villa to lunch and laundry and keeping the place in tip-top shape. 

She’s a treat. Native Turks and Caicos Islander, probably about 150 years old and I wouldn’t mess with her on a dare. However, you need something, and I mean anything, see Joko and it’ll probably arrive within a couple of hours. 

Anyways, I’m motoring home and in-between some really awful cigars, I’m on the phone trying to get everything planned for the trip. Before, everyone was to meet in Galveston, get loaded onto the boat I had rented for just such an occasion and we’d take a couple of days lazing our way to Turks and Cacios. 

I had planned on taking Khan and Clyde, but with flying and all the attending nonsense that entails, they are going to have to stay home. I can’t find a doggy jail or cat compound that’ll take either on such short notice. Besides, Khan gets all huffy for weeks when we leave him alone in doggy-jail. Plus, it’s bloody expensive to board a vivacious and voracious 300-pound animal in places that are more use to teacup Shih Tzus, micro-poodles, and pocket gophers. 

I have decided that it’s necessary to call Cletus and Arch, along with the rest of his brood, and see if they’d house, dog, and cat sit for us while we’re gone. It’s going to be a tad dicey, because I hadn’t included Cletus and his crowd on this trip to the Caribbean. 

“There’s always next time”, I say aloud to no one in particular, and ring Cletus’ number. 

“Yo, Cletus, Doc here. You got a minute?” I ask over my cellphone telephone device. 

“Yeah, Doc.”, Cletus sounds a bit worried, “What? Another mining disaster? How many this time?”

“No, no”, I reply, “Nothing like that. I just need a favor from you.”

“Oh. OK”, Cletus replies, “What’s up?”

“Well, Cletus”, I say, “It’s like this. We’re taking family and some friends down to the islands for the holidays. I was going to drive a boat from Galveston and take Khan and Clyde with us, but that’s changed.”

“Yeah?”, Cletus says curiously. 

“Well’, I continued, “With Es and I being new grandparents, Daughter #1 and husband balked at the boat ride with a couple of newly minted twins. So we’re going to fly instead.”

“Yeah?”, Cletus says curiously.

“So the thing is”, I went on, “Is that I need someone to look after Khan and Clyde as we need to leave them home now.”

“OK”, Cletus says. 

“So”, I conclude, “I’d like you and your family to stay at our house and mind the critters. It’d be for about a week and a half or so. Of course, you and Arch, if he decides to join in, will be paid for your time.”

“OK”, Cletus replied quickly. “So you want me and the family to stay at your place and take care of Khan and Clyde? You’ve got how many bedrooms in your place?”

“There’s 6, all with attached, private bathrooms.” I note. 

“OK”, Cletus is gearing up, “You’ve got a pool and hot tub, right?”

“Yeah”, I said, “You’ve seen both when you dropped me off here a couple months past…”

“Right”, Cletus continues, “And we can smoke outside?”

“Sure.”

“And we can raid your freezers and bars?”

“I…suppose”. 

“Well”, Cletus says, “In that case, when do we need to be down there?”

“Look, Cletus”, I say, “You can bring your crew down here for the holidays. We’ve got a shitload of food in the freezers and I will expect you to have a spot of decorum when you attack my liquor supply. However, under no circumstances does anyone go into my office. I’m not locking that door, but I expect my humidors to be as full as when I left them. Plus, you need to keep prying eyes out of the nerve center of Rocknocker Resources, Llc. You diggin’ me Beaumont?”

“Ummm. Yeah?” Cletus stammers. 

“WE GREEN, MISTER?”, I holler into the phone. 

The codeword has dropped. We’re into some serious shit territory now. 

“Yes, sir”, Cletus replies. “Green as grass.”

“Alrighty then”, I say, “Gather your herd and meet Es and me tonight at the house. We’ll go over a few particulars and the next morning, we’ll be out of your hair. We’ve got a car and driver to take us to Albuquerque and we’ll fly to Turks & Caicos from there.”

“Right, Doc”, Cletus said with a bit more iron in his voice. “I’ve got to arrange a bit of work around here before we go but we’ll see you no later than 1900 hours.”

“Groovy”, I say, “That’ll work just fine. I may have a couple of extra jobs for you while we’re gone, that is, if you want to make a few spare bucks over the holidays.”

“Sounds good, Doc”, Cletus chirpily replied. “See you this evening.”

“Great”, I replied, “See you then.”

I hung up the phone, slurped a half-can of road beer, and smile that I’ve now got things back on track, as it were. Then I remember that open containers are frowned upon in New Mexico, so I kill the brew and chuck the crushed empty into a paper, rather than a translucent, Stop-N-Rob monomolecular-thick, plastic bag. 

“West bound and down…” I think as I zip past Clovis and head in a generally northwesterly direction. 

Later that evening, I pull into the palatial digs and headquarters of Rocknocker Resources, Llc. 

“Hello, honey”, I said, channeling Jackie Gleason in more ways than one, “I’m home!”

I am immediately blindsided by Khan and Clyde. They’ve sorted out their canine-feline differences and have instead teamed up to bury me under a good three hundred twenty-five pounds of fur and fluff. 

“ACK!” I said, which was soon thereafter followed by “OOF!”

“Collective heads of knuckle!”, I roar in faux fury, “Let me up, you goofs!”

Esme appears, surveys the situation, snickers and helps me back on my feet. 

She also hands me a large, cold high-octane libation. 

“How did you know?”, I asked as I gratefully accept and down half the potable potation. 

“Forty-four years of marriage”, Es sheeshes, “And he asks ’How did I know’?”

I plant a sloppy wet buss on her cheeks and smile disarmingly. 

“Let’s go, you”, Es orders. “After seventeen hours of driving, you’ve got to be locked up solid. Strip and in the hot tub. Now, mister.”

I can never deny Esme, my love and betrothed, when she orders me to get naked and go for a soak. 

With the pulsating waters and potent potables, we’re relaxing in the Jacuzzi when the topic of our Turks and Caicos trip comes up. 

“Yep”, I replied, “Got Cletus and his crew coming here to pet-sit the beasts.”

“And when are they supposed to arrive?” Es chuckles. 

I look her in the eye and grimace. 

“They’re right behind me, aren’t they?” I ask. 

“Oh, yeah”, Es smiles as she’s wearing a swimsuit and, well, I’m not. 

“Tell my soon to be ex-employees to go into the house and not look back for at least a few minutes. Any deviation from these orders will result in both immediate shock and termination.” I growl. 

I hear Cletus and Arch snicker as well as a cacophony of new voices. 

A lot of new voices. 

Khan and Clyde are beside themselves getting to know their sitters. 

“All these new people to lavish praise upon and feed us,” I’m certain they were both thinking. 

I show Cletus and Arch the whys and wherefores of the Villa de Rocknocker and remind them that they’re house and pet-sitting, not on freeloading holiday, as it were. 

“Yes, bossman”, they both deflect my litany of things not to do while inhabiting their boss’ digs as their eyes goggle at our bespoke Hemi-powered coffee machine. Plus, they were enchanted with the long list of our other kitchen appliances from around the globe, our large 103” Panasonic TV, complete with all the available streaming services, stereo and reel to reels, the general house layout, especially the outdoor Jacuzzi and fire pit.

“OK, gents”, I continue, “You have the run of the place save and except for my office as per previous threats. Here’s the closet where the pets’ foods are kept. Make certain the fridge herein is closed as we don’t want any of the raw foods I have for Khan and Clyde to go bad. That shit’s expensive.”

“Yes, bossman”, I hear in unison. 

There’s now Cletus, Cletus’ wife, or ex-wife, I never figured out that relationship, Arch and his most recent paramour, along with three more of Cletus’ youngster brood. 

“Here’s the garage freezer”, I note, “It’s jam-packed with chow; steaks, hams, turkeys, and the like. So go ahead and help yourselves. There’s no way that you’ll even make a dent in this supply.”

I retrospect, I shouldn’t have laid down that wager. 

“Um, Rock”, Cletus hesitantly spoke. “That extra work you mentioned earlier…?”

“Oh, yeah. Here’s a bunch of cans of automotive paint. If you’re so inclined, I want Lulubelle and Leslie the Load Lifter cleaned, de-greased, and painted in the official *Rocknocker Resources* business colors.”

“Which are?”, Arch asked with arched eyebrows. 

“Dark Green (PMS 5535 C), Gold (PMS 1235 C) and White (11-0601 TCX)”, I smiled *Smilodon-tly*.

“Green, gold and white…?” Cletus smiled and Arch groaned. 

“Yep”, I smiled even wider, “Official Green Bay Packers colors. I’ll leave it up to you to figure out the proper method and mode for color placement.”

I’d live to regret that decision as well.

1ipisa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opusdeiexposed/comments/1ipisa2/josemaria_escriva_rockstar_prima_donna_opus_dei/,Josemaria Escriva: Rockstar Prima Donna (Opus Dei),"Being on tour with a band is a hard life.  
  
You’re in a different city almost every night. Drive to a new city, set up the equipment, soundcheck, perform, breakdown, back on the bus, next city… over and over again.  
  
It is relentless and exhausting.  
  
To make things run as smoothly as possible, a band’s contract with the concert promoter will include a rider that includes the band’s requirements and the things necessary to make the show run smoothly. It will include stage dimensions, power requirements, time needed for setup, etc.  
  
The rider will also include things such as the food and beverages that the band wants backstage.  
  
That makes sense.  
  
Touring is grueling and having a selection of food and drinks available as well as other items that can help the performers relax before a show can only help them give their best.  
  
But sometimes performers get a little high on their own sense of self-importance and the requirements in the riders start getting weird.  
  
Like, really weird.  
  
Van Halen famously insisted on having no brown M&M’s under any circumstances. Motley Crue’s Nikki Sixx required directions to the closest AA meeting, a sub-machine gun, and a 12-foot boa constrictor. J-Lo insists that her coffee only be stirred counterclockwise. Mariah Carrey requires butterfly shaped confetti, a pink carpet, 100 doves, and 20 white kittens.  
  
Which brings me to Josemaria Escriva.  
  
It seems that he had some rockstar prima donna tendencies.  
  
The new HBO Max series includes a story that when JME was traveling, there was a female numerary who travelled as part of his entourage to make sure that everything was perfect for him.  
  
One of his “rider requirements” was that his bedsheets be turned down by the women of Opus Dei. But they had to wear lots of his favorite cologne (Atkinsons) when doing it so that he would not be able to smell that they had touched his bed.  
  
That’s Mariah Carrey level prima donnaship.  
  
That example is top of mind because I recently saw the second episode from the HBO series.  
  
But it is far from a one-off incident.  
  
Maria Tapia’s book and Opus Libros cite many examples of similar behavior. Traveling with a cook who could make meals just as he liked them. Insisting that a nax re-make his omelet 5 times because he didn’t like the way she made it. Requiring that out-of-season fruit be shipped internationally so it would be available for him when he traveled.  
  
Can you imagine Francis of Assisi or Teresa of Avila doing things like that?  
  
I can’t.  
  
But I could imagine David Lee Roth or Mick Jagger doing things like that. (And I don’t mean to sully their reputations by putting them in the same category as JME.)  
  
Josemaria Escriva had a lot more in common with prima donna rockstars than he did with men and women the Church has canonized as saints.  
  
*“Aren’t you attacking his reputation?”*  
  
Absolutely.  
  
I am attacking his reputation for holiness.  
  
Why?  
  
Because he was not holy according to the Church’s own criteria for holiness. Many of the practices he put into place and ways of thinking he taught his “children” are not compatible with Christian charity.

*“But isn’t it bad to speak ill of the dead?”*  
  
Maybe.  
  
But Opus Dei uses his reputation for holiness to attract people to itself and to justify its continued abusive practices.  
  
So, his reputation for holiness is very much a live issue.

I have hypothyroidism and diet controlled type 2 diabetes, along with PCOS, and at 33 this was my second pregnancy (I miscarried at 8 weeks when I was 26 years old, too) we were so thrilled!! After 3 days, I started wiping pink when I went to the bathroom. After a couple of days, I began experiencing some cramping- both of these things, I discovered were completely normal. I went to the EPAU, and waited for hours to be examined to be told that I wasn’t having a miscarriage and that I should only go back if I had severe cramps and started passing clots. The following week, I went back and was told the same thing ‘you’re not likely miscarrying, it’s a threatened miscarriage’ I was absolutely beside myself. Thankfully, as a ‘high risk’ pregnancy, I was able to book a 6 week scan. I went into my 6 week scan with a horrible feeling in my stomach that they wouldn’t be able to find a heartbeat. My husband said he was still holding on hope and that I should try to do the same. Within seconds, the doctor running the scan said ‘I’m not seeing a pregnancy’. As I got dressed, literally crying in this bathroom, she spoke to my husband and said ‘there definitely was one at some point, or it could be that we’re just too early’. She told me the same as I’m there crying, because I KNEW the pregnancy had gone on that Friday before the scan, before they told me I’m probably not miscarrying but might be. I then had to do 48H HCG testing to see how my levels changed in that time. I had to take more time off work to attend the hospital. On Wednesday, I’m trying to work, waiting for a phone call, and I get the phone call, which lasted less than one minute saying 
‘It looks like your levels halved and so your pregnancy failed- come back next week so we can check again’ and that was it. 
I’ve taken even more time off work (I work a public facing support role and I have nothing to give anybody right now) and I can’t function. One minute I’m fine and feel guilty for feeling fine,  next I’m scream crying at my husband. I wonder if I hadn’t had the hope, the carrot dangled in front of me the whole time, it would have felt better? The afternoon after I was told my pregnancy failed all of my bleeding stopped, my body felt the way it did before I was pregnant, and I had more energy- in spite of switching to decaf coffee the second I found out about the pregnancy.. what do I do now? When do I go back to work and pretend to like people again? 
Do we try again? I don’t know. ",1,1739561349.0,Miscarriage,0,1.0,False

I gave UGC Valet a try as a beta tester. I was curious about how real this tool was and if it could really replace the hassle of traditional video production. Here’s what I experienced:

# A Smooth Start

I signed up and found the login process refreshingly simple. The dashboard welcomed me with clear options, and choosing an actor didn’t feel confusing at all. I picked one that matched my brand tone, and it felt like the process was designed with non-techies in mind.

# The Script Writing Process

At first, I worried about how well the AI would write a script for me. To my surprise, the built-in script writer handled it like a pro. I even tweaked a few parts to match my voice, and the changes were seamless. The word counter and time estimator were great additions since I like keeping my clips brief.

# Watching the Video Come Together

When I hit the “Create Video” button, I watched as the actor lip-synced perfectly to my script. The subtitles were spot on, and each emotion I selected was captured in the delivery. I received the finished video in minutes—saving me hours of work compared to past video projects.

# Profiting from It

I then used the video in a small ad campaign on Instagram. The response was impressive. Engagement increased clearly, and a few clients even reached out afterward about similar projects. UGC Valet gave me a real taste of how this tool can boost business without a long learning curve.

Working student (ride-hailing app rider) ang boyfriend ko (M24) he just continued studying this school year after huminto for 3 years because of the pandemic. I (F21) met him online in May 2020. Within those 3 years, hindi siya nawalan ng sideline. Lahat ng kinikita niya from Monday-Saturday, gagastusin niya sa pamasahe and food namin every Sunday. Halos lahat ng klase ng sideline, pinatulan niya just to have an income at hindi matambay sa bahay nila. Pumupunta siya dito sa bahay since pandemic nga that time. 

Today, our initial plan was to go to the place he recommended from before pa. But recently, sagad talaga. Hinatid niya ako nang maaga sa school then bumyahe agad siya afterwards. He was supposed to pick me up then go to the place together pero kulang pa raw pera niya. I told him na okay lang naman sa fast food pero ayaw niya.

Kanina, nasa jeep ako habang binabasa ko yung message niya. Sobrang nasasaktan ako, hindi ko alam kung bakit. Siguro nasasaktan ako in a good way? Ang sarap mahalin ng lalaking to, ang sarap niyang magmahal. Sobrang mapagmahal siya sa pamilya, kaibigan, sakin, at sa pamilya ko. Gentle, soft-spoken at funny. Lahat ng adjustments ginagawa niya para sakin. Sobrang bait kaya natatakot ako na baka nat-take advantage ko na siya nang hindi ko alam. 

Bago niya ko puntahan tonight, sinundo niya muna mommy niya. Nakaidlip na ko kahihintay sa kaniya then he woke me up with a boquet of a single sunflower surrounded with other different flowers. 😭😭😭 HE STILL GOT ME FLOWERS 🥺🥺🥺
Okay lang naman kung hindi, kasi naiintindihan ko. Pero jusko Lord 🥺 sobrang nakaka-touch huhu. Tinanong ko siya kung nap-pressure ba siya sakin, sabi niya hindi raw. Siya yung nagp-pressure sa sarili niya to treat me the best that I deserve, at isang beses lang naman daw sa isang taon na girly girly ako. After that, bumili kami ng food sa fave coffee shop ko then watched netflix.

Mahal na mahal kita, ba. I'm sorry na ganito yung situations natin both. Tangina sana ikaw pa rin kasama ko kapag sumakses na tayo. Sabi ko sa kaniya kanina ""sana ikaw na no? Kasi parang hindi ko kaya kapag hindi, hindi ko alam kung paano makaka-move on.""

For some background, my boyfriend is a bit of a health nut. He used to play football in college and still takes weight training seriously (sometimes too seriously IMO). He cares a lot about maintaining low body fat. I don’t really care if he put on some more fat (in fact I would kinda prefer it). At the beginning of the year, he cut coffee. He mentioned that it is messing with his sleep and that he feels like his stress hormones are out of whack. Ok, noted.

This past two weeks leading up to Valentine’s Day have been brutal for him work-wise. He wakes up at 6-7am and works until 2-3am. Even though I want my boyfriend to do cute and nice things for me leading up to Valentine’s Day, I’ve stayed out of his way due to work. I came over last night in the hopes of finding time for connection, but he said he has to wrap up this project and that he will be more available socially and emotionally once the project is complete. I watched some TV on my iPad and fell asleep in his bed. 

I decided to work from his apartment since I was supposed to have a light day and he said he would be free after he gave his client pitch at 7-8am. I usually wake up at 6am and watch something or read, so I went to his living room to hang out while he slept. When I went to the refrigerator, I noticed that he had ordered Chinese food last night (which is against his diet goals). At 6:30am, he rolled out and bed and made a coffee, which bothered me given that he’s made a big deal about what he can and cannot eat on a daily basis with me.

When he came out of his meeting I asked him “what happened to no coffee,” and when he was confused by it I clarified that I was frustrated that he isn’t sticking to his own health goals that he set. He just told me to leave his apartment without discussing it. When I tried to ask him to talk it out, he raised his voice to demand I leave. 

It’s been a few hours, and he has turned off his personal phone. I’ve tried his work phone but he has been screening out my calls. I’m considering going back to his building to talk about it. 

Was I wrong to point out how him not following through on the goals he set are bothering me.

1ipiezn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ipiezn,"The Andes Traverse: Bikepacking 7,000 Miles Across South American Backcountry","I’ve been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina and my progression across the Andes has crept slowly, cautious, painstaking. After rounding the Darién Gap by sailboat to Cartagena was a 500-mile marathon along la Ruta del Sol. Heat indexes pushed +120°F [48°C] through Mompox toward Bucaramanga. Eight liters of water each day still wasn’t enough. The cold couldn’t come sooner. And then it stayed forever.
 
Each passing day brought new personal records for highest mountain passes. First the wintry páramos of Colombia’s Northeastern Cordillera. Purple bricks of bocadillo [guava paste] became my saving grace.
 
Then the Trampoline of Death between two militant valleys en route towards the Trans Ecuador Volcano Corridor. I crashed atop Chimborazo when the winds grew too strong. Each day saw insatiable hunts for locro de papa [bright yellow potato soup] with chicha morada [purple corn drink], but food wasn’t always so easy to find.
 
Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].
 
When I look back on those roads now, my instinctual response is choked in trauma. “No way, I could never,” as if forcibly forgetting each cruel bend in the gravel. It’s been perhaps the most beautiful part of the journey thus far, but also the most backbreakingly difficult. You reach your physical and emotional capacity by 5pm each day, yet have no choice but to throw yourself past it week after week for months without letup. Your body crumbles over and over, but there’s nowhere to escape to and no way to get there.
 
From up above the clouds, each payoff remains breathsnatching. Camp colors, indelible. Ahead lie Bolivia, Chile and Argentina still. It just might take some time to come down.

### 🌐 AI: The Digital Detective

AI is essentially our new-age Sherlock Holmes. From decoding complex data patterns to predicting patient outcomes, AI's ability to parse through vast datasets with lightning speed is nothing short of a superpower. By doing so, it uncovers insights that might take humans decades to discover. Imagine having all your medical records sifted through by the best digital detective, identifying even the slightest anomaly. 🕵️

### 🧬 Drug Discovery at Warp Speed

What used to take labs years to discover, AI systems can now determine in months. Through machine learning algorithms, AI is enabling researchers to simulate how drugs interact with the human body before they even move to trials. This isn’t just a game-changer; it’s a lifeline, potentially saving countless lives with timely discoveries! 🚀✨

### 🤝 Bridging Gaps and Customizing Care

One of the most heartwarming benefits of AI in healthcare is its ability to make personalized medicine possible. By analyzing a patient’s genetic makeup, AI can suggest tailored treatment plans, enhancing effectiveness and reducing side effects. Are we looking at a future where each medication is custom-made for individuals? AI says, ""Yes, we can!"" 🧑‍⚕️🔬

I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)

I avoid most carbs because it causes me excessive abdominal swelling and I drink mostly lemon water, Diet Pepsi and coffee with heavy whipping cream. I work in an office and walk around throughout the day but I only average about 4500 steps a day.

1ipi1fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1ipi1fz/functional_disorder/,functional disorder,"I have had an eating disorder since I was 12 years old - I am turning 31 in a couple of months. It started with a diet that turned into obsession when I was 12. My dad's criticism and the overall toxic family dynamics at home were a huge instigator to this. I had periods of being better, and then doing worse. I struggled the worst between ages 16-19 (ranging between >!13.5-15.5 bmi!<)

The disorder over time transformed beautifully from purely restricting, to restricting and overexercising, restricting and binging and using exercise to purge, to then restricting binging and purging. I was formally diagnosed with AN binge purge subtype at 17 and was put into therapy against my will which never helped. 

I recovered by myself when I was around 20-21 and was living alone away from my family - I believe having my own space and not having to be around their toxicity helped me a lot. I completely stopped all exercise around this time and slowly slowly got myself eating again. I overshot my weight gain by my standards to about 19.5 bmi but was able to accept it. I had a stable relationship from age 23 to 27, this also helped me accept myself more as I felt loved and desired. My partner was also a big foodie and she made me excited about trying new cuisines and restaurants - I discovered that I actually love food and always did, I just didn't allow myself these pleasures. During this period my eating disorder was pretty much quiet. 

The thoughts and behaviors came back around the time this relationship ended in 2021. I lost around >!10% of my bodyweight!< in a few months and been maintaining there since (>!17.5 bmi!<)... however over time I also started being very OCD with my diet and exercise. It creeped back slowly but surely. 

Right now I can't eat anything that's out of my routine or it will trigger me to binge and purge, or I will feel so angry and out of control if I just have to sit with having eaten something that I wasn't planning on eating. I exercise 6-7 days a week as a must. I've not lost more weight but lost significant body fat% due to eating super clean and in a deficit (with the occasional B/P) and exercise. I haven't had my period for over a year now. I've also started telling everyone in my life that I can't have dairy and gluten, so I can say no to most food without anyone challenging me. 

Despite all of this, I am very functioning, I work a full time job which is super demanding (accountants, busy season anyone?), I will cope with the stress a lot of times by binging and purging WHILE working on my laptop at home... as if having to work 14 hour days isn't hard enough, I make it even harder for myself physically - just to cope with the situation mentally I guess. I don't feel like this is impacting me negatively weirdly. I do feel more lonely now though as I pretty much avoid social things - I only really agree to see people for coffee or if it's a super healthy restaurant and I know the calories. I also stopped drinking alcohol almost completely, not worth the calories (nor the hangover anxiety tbh).

There is no real point to this post. It is just a story time. Can anyone relate to being a lonely super functioning ED girl who looks like has it all together? ",8,1739559554.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

For some background, my boyfriend is a bit of a health nut. He used to play football in college and still takes weight training seriously (sometimes too seriously IMO). He cares a lot about maintaining low body fat. I don’t really care if he put on some more fat (in fact I would kinda prefer it). At the beginning of the year, he cut coffee. He mentioned that it is messing with his sleep and that he feels like his stress hormones are out of whack. Ok, noted.

This past two weeks leading up to Valentine’s Day have been brutal for him work-wise. He wakes up at 6-7am and works until 2-3am. Even though I want my boyfriend to do cute and nice things for me leading up to Valentine’s Day, I’ve stayed out of his way due to work. I came over last night in the hopes of finding time for connection, but he said he has to wrap up this project and that he will be more available socially and emotionally once the project is complete. I watched some TV on my iPad and fell asleep in his bed. 

I decided to work from his apartment since I was supposed to have a light day and he said he would be free after he gave his client pitch at 7-8am. I usually wake up at 6am and watch something or read, so I went to his living room to hang out while he slept. When I went to the refrigerator, I noticed that he had ordered Chinese food last night (which is against his diet goals). At 6:30am, he rolled out and bed and made a coffee, which bothered me given that he’s made a big deal about what he can and cannot eat on a daily basis with me.

When he came out of his meeting I asked him “what happened to no coffee,” and when he was confused by it I clarified that I was frustrated that he isn’t sticking to his own health goals that he set. He just told me to leave his apartment without discussing it. When I tried to ask him to talk it out, he raised his voice to demand I leave. 

It’s been a few hours, and he has turned off his personal phone. I’ve tried his work phone but he has been screening out my calls. I’m considering going back to his building to talk about it. What should I do to get him to understand how frustrating it is to see someone not follow through on their own goals?

Tl;dr: my boyfriend hasn’t followed through with his own health goals. I voiced my frustration about it, and now he won’t talk to me",1,1739558964.0,u_Ok-Bake-8080,0,1.0,False

I have neeeever had someone beaten.

Like grow up? punching the wall? Breaking your hand punching the door?? Lying to your surgeon about how you broke it???????
Reeeeeeal piece of work
-punches walls 
-thinks he isn’t emotionally stable enough for a job and i watched him rage quit door dashing after two orders 
-tweaks at his mom about what she is doing in the house or providing for him as if he wasn’t 29 (now 30) when we dated…… you wanna screech at her about drain flies???? Fucking fix it you’re a grown ass man oh my god she’s old just leave her alone. 
-been to jail now after he got on me and a detention center as a kid for sending child porn (nudes) of his ex which he did again as an adult? Put revenge porn of his younger ex on Reddit with her name and town.  
-can’t handle other people getting special attention and having special days ❤️ he ruined the two performances i had in our relationship, my birthday, and Halloween :’3333333333 huge blowups, so awesome. those were the sole special events in our relationship too, he didn’t have any besides Halloween which we shared a love of I thought. but needed to ruin mine and his alike. 
-told me he needs his mom to die ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
-thought a guy at the gas station was going to fight him for looking at him funny
-slept outside my house in his car 
-has hit a couple women, if not 3 or more. 
-didn’t even have the patience to learn to play jack box with my friends and made it kinda weird 
-accused me of not being serious enough about him (one of his first weird signs) when we had been dating for a few weeks and i had been paying him,giving him little gifts and spending all of my available time with him because i have a mortgage at my current house.. like what, you want me to just go be trapped somewhere with you right now? Ew
-❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️read my journal❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
-admitted to reading my journal in order to confront me about an entry pertaining to some hookups i had before we dated cause he thought a client i was selling a video to with the same name was the guy i named in my diary. 
-i told him my ex slapped me once, pushed me in public out of impatience, and before we ever dated he gagged me unconscious during sex (i clearly don’t have the best standards of treatment im working on it) and after i told him my exs name he assumed he would be in my followers or following on instagram and asked me about a guy with the same name who i met at a convention and talked to me and my previous bf about stuffed animals and our collections. He thought he must just be the same guy, that i would have my mean ex in my followers. Another bad sign. Like why would you even think that, you think im someone who keeps people around who treated me badly like.. no i get rid of you and push you far away. He was very determined to treat me badly so i guess this logic tracks for him. 
- accused me in many ways, several times of cheating or planning to cheat on him. the last visit we had, i found a light blue Covid mask i had never seen on his floor when i was always tidying his room and had a pretty good memory of his things. I get in the bed? Pair of women’s pants. I ask if they’re his moms, instead of looking and guessing he says something to entirely dismiss it. Like “I don’t know, im not sure what they are” basically. Right 
-oh did I mention he ruined our only camping trip too 
-he turned down his only offer to perform live I saw him receive throughout our whole relationship, he was not taking his music stuff seriously and then decided to have a blowup at me for asking him to let me sleep when he was working on a song right next to me in the morning. Yelling at me as if I was not supportive of his art. I helped him film a music video and he was my most listened to artist on Spotify last year, number one. deluded. 

Here is the kicker ❤️ we dated from the end of may to November 1st, we spent sooooo much time together the whole time. On November 1st, I show him a message I received from a prospective customer. He had agreed to buy content soon, I texted that morning and said “you gotta buy content today or im removing you sorry” which was something I had started doing for my boyfriends comfort and security. The man responds “never sent me the stuff” when he had never agreed to buy anything before. I showed it to my boyfriend and I say “this is so annoying like what does he mean” basically. He snatches my phone and sends voice memos, I forget what they said at first. He gives my phone back I think and I delete them. He sees I’ve deleted his voice memos and takes my phone to send more, where he tells this guy where he lives ❤️ he just spares the house number, and invited him to fight basically. he then insists we must know each other and show me whether or not he follows my ig, he is a perfect stranger that he’s just told where he lives. he didn’t follow my instagram either. 
He insists that he needs to go through my phone now. I’m like okay please just sit with me and let’s do it together, he eventually sits next to me and snatches my phone again. In my head in this moment “he has disrespected me for the last time, and he is not telling anymore guys who buy my content where to locate us”. I stand up, he is so distracted trying to read my texts that he doesn’t notice me getting ready to snatch it from him, I do. He begins yelling “ow my hand!! Why are you doing this my hand is broken!!!” trying to make a fuss and make me look crazy. I forget what exactly happens next, he angrily shoves the coffee table while we are standing on either side of it. Then he’s like you need to go, im like yeah duh. He thought he was going to drive me home all crazy angry though, absolutely not. I go up to pack and call my nearest friend for some help. He comes up saying something weird like “darling, are you packing?” Real nightmare stuff. He was being really really erratic before this.

He sees me on the phone, immediately displeased again, thinks im bringing other people into it. I explain it’s a woman who is just going to help me and stay out of it ❤️ I then go to pack up my bong, he rips it from my hands and I then scream dont break it, leave me alone im packing get the fuck away and let me pack my stuff like you said. 
I then remember being on the bed, sitting back with him gripping my shoulders and I raised my knees between us yelljng get off get off get off get off, he said “don’t try to kick me in the balls” which I was not in fact doing he was scaring me and I wanted him to stop grabbing me so close so I made space with my legs that he couldn’t invade. Then he ripped me to the floor. 
He grabbed my thighs, pulled me to land on my tailbone off the bed, then he was fully over me. He wasn’t punching me, he was wrapping me up in a stranglehold and grabbing me and biting me. I somehow inched towards the door, I have already screamed for help at this point with no response. So my body just tried to pick up my phone and call the police, he slaps my phone to the floor and says something like don’t try it. he had my neck again by the door I believe and i said “please stop babe im scared im scared” he just goes “..i know you’re scared”. 
my next memory is im somehow out of the bedroom door. he grabs me at the top of the stairs by the back of my sweatshirt. i am trying with all of my might to just walk down, it was like a slow motion dream. he somehow turns me around, i am going down the wooden stairs backwards. I try to slip myself down and out of my sweatshirt with my arms over my head since i think he was holding my sleeve? he then grabs my actual arm and turns me around to getting in a stranglehold that actually began cutting my air and making me choke for air. the bottom of the stairs and front door are separated by maybe 8 feet. my memory here is just kind of us walking forward to the door while he choked me. I don’t remember a struggle for the doorknob while I unlocked it. He let me go as soon as I got the door open, I walk to their (his parents, this is their house) garden gate and sit down believing he’s done bothering me with witnesses. he yells at me that “this is why your house burned down”. It burned when I was 15, it was a hoarder house my parents were keeping me in and it fixed my life a lot to not live there. he knew that. he then yells at a woman passerby that I did something very bad to him. I call the cops, in my memory I said “my boyfriend was just getting on me a lot and choking me”. he took my phone twice while I tried to call for help if I remember right, then makes me walk down the sidewalk after him demanding it. Probably trying to make me look crazy some more. He throws my phone in the grass and then goes to “help! Help me!” While walking away. The police call me back and ask only for my location so they can come quickly since my calls got disconnected. they take him to jail for a month ❤️ 
I was only able to describe to the policeman that we were “up and down the stairs” and that he was choking me at the door while I was in shock. He is out of jail now ❤️❤️❤️ what a man!! i pity any women in his vicinity he is demonic ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",1,1739558682.0,BreakUps,8,1.0,False
1iphovk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1iphovk/question_do_any_hyperrealistic_business/,"Question: Do any hyper-realistic business, management, or landlord games exist?","I got curious the other day because I’ve been in the mood for the running a business, hotel, or apartment building game kinda mood lately and I remembered my old hospitality and tourism class. We had this sim where it was meant to be a realistic version of a hotel. You’d adjust room costs, adjust employee wages, fire employees cause they were on their phone while people were at the check in counter, you’d adjust the prices of the hotel restaurant food so it could both be bought cause the price was low but also be high enough to pay for the wages and ingredient costs. Basically, it was a hyper realistic sim of hotel management meant to train you on what you’d do as a hotel manager. So I was wondering if GAMES like this exist. Like a lot of non hyper realistic games have weirdly realistic features that I wish were put all into one hyper realistic game. Like FNAF pizza sim had fucking lawsuits,  papa’s games like pizzeria or frosteria had regular customers tip more, 911 operator and 112 had real life calls put into the game. Shit like this is always in game that aren’t particularly realistic but they have these weirdly realistic parts to them. So I’m wondering if there is a game that’s kinda like all those realistic parts made into one hyper realistic management game. Like managing a restaurant and being able to bribe customers to keep them from using bad reviews, or a coffee shop sim that lets you give specific customers discounts so they tip more and come in more often, or a apartment manager where inflation can cause the price of goods to go up in which tenants might not be able to pay you cause they have to afford said goods. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any hyper realistic business or apartment/land management games like I described?

TLDR: anyone know any good extremely hyper realistic business/residential management games that are extremely similar to real life.",2,1739558669.0,gamingsuggestions,2,1.0,False

I think I’ve done a #2 TWICE within the last three weeks. Nothing has changed in terms of my diet and exercise. I always eat enough fibre and protein, I am quite active (work a job in healthcare where I’m standing and walking a lot, go to the gym 3-4 times a week, constantly getting 8-15k steps a day). My doctor prescribed me these fibre powder packets I mix in with water that make me so incredibly nauseous but also does jack shit to get my bowel movements going— so I have resorted to laxatives which is SO not fun.

I struggled a lot with constipation before first starting birth control Jan 2024. I have switched pills 3 times since and the 2nd one was the only one to relieve me of my constipation symptoms (from what I presume is bowel endo) but the pain was coming back after 3 months so my doctors switched me to a new pill. And on top of that, my cramps are back at almost the same intensity as it was pre-BC. 

I’m just feeling so frustrated. I’m currently on the waiting list to see an endo specialist (which might take months) and until then I really don’t know what else to do to help with all of this. I hate feeling so bloated and heavy. I hate going through my day pretending like I’m not in pain from my ovaries wreaking havoc and getting random vaginal spasms. I’m just so tired. 

I do everything to try alleviate my symptoms. I eat dried fruits (dates, raisins, apricot), chia seeds, nuts, whole grain bread, beans. I do abdominal massages to help get things “moving”. I do yoga and pilates. I drink coffee in hopes that kicks things into gear (because usually after 1-2 sips I’m SPRINTING to the toilet). I drink 2L of water, I eat smaller portions, I’ve tried spicy food, etc. 

For my cramps there’s not much I can do— I’m afraid to take more ibuprofen because I’ve taken WAY too much and it’s damaging my stomach lining. No other over-the-counter pain medication helps. Heating pads and blankets can only do so much before I give myself toasted skin. Raspberry leaf tea does nothing for me.

It's advisable to consult with your insurance provider to ensure your policy meets the necessary criteria. Remember, having proper insurance can help mitigate financial risks and ensure peace of mind during your stay.

# Health and Safety

Your health and safety are paramount when applying for the Belize Digital Nomad Visa. You will need to provide documentation showing that you do not have any contagious diseases.

By ensuring you meet these health requirements, you contribute to maintaining the health and safety standards within the country.

* Recent medical records
* Health screening upon arrival

# Background Check

In addition to demonstrating your income and health status, you will also need to undergo a background check. This ensures that you have no criminal record that might pose a risk to Belizean society. The background check process usually includes verifying your identity and checking for any criminal history. Providing accurate and complete information during this process is crucial to avoid delays or rejection of your application.

Keep track of your application status and respond promptly to any additional requests for information or documentation.

# Supporting Documentation

While the above documents are essential, you may also need to provide supporting documentation to strengthen your application.

These additional documents can help convince the authorities that you are a reliable and responsible digital nomad.

# Exploring Local Cuisine

One of the most delightful aspects of living in Belize is sampling its diverse cuisine. Breakfast could be a hearty plate of fry jacks, a traditional Belizean dish made from fried dough, often served with eggs, beans, or cheese.

# Work-Life Balance

Many digital nomads find that the relaxed pace of life in Belize helps them achieve a better work-life balance.

Co-working spaces like Pangea Pod in San Pedro and Hubworks in Belize City offer not only a professional environment but also a sense of community.

Many language schools and private tutors offer classes tailored to travelers and expats. Even a few phrases can go a long way in showing respect and building rapport with the community.

# Embracing the Slow Pace

One of the biggest adjustments for many digital nomads is embracing the slower pace of life. Unlike in fast-paced cities, you’ll find that people in Belize take their time to enjoy each moment. This can be both refreshing and challenging. To fully adapt, try to adopt a more relaxed mindset, savoring the simple pleasures of daily life. Whether it’s a leisurely stroll along the beach or a sunset yoga session, finding moments of stillness can help you integrate more deeply into the Belizean lifestyle.

*(Fair warning this is a decently long read,* *consider yourself informed)*

I want to talk about something that’s been frustrating me for a while—the fact that Wargaming constantly undermines its own goodwill with relentless, often exploitative monetization.

Even when they do something objectively good—like solid map reworks, announcing their development of a new Match Maker, and implementing Crew 2.0 improvements, or long-overdue tech tree buffs—I can’t help but notice it’s almost always immediately overshadowed by some predatory sales tactic. 

The most recent examples being the Lunar boxes with clone tanks and the recent sale of Waffentrager E 100 for 100k gold... So instead of celebrating the previously mentioned positive changes, the player base is constantly left waiting for the other shoe to drop because history has conditioned us to expect the worst from WG. 

# Wargaming Is Inducing Player Amnesia?

Really this all boils down to a trust issue. Players can’t give credit when it’s due because they can’t **trust** Wargaming. Every time they build goodwill with good changes, they immediately burn it down with some absurd monetization stunt. 

And this is something that goes far back in the game's history. Unfortunately, the relationship between **monetization and power creep** (and its subsequent negative effects) is so deeply embedded in the game’s history that players almost **expect** the bad with the good. And this is because this power creep happened for well over 7 years, if not longer.

This has resulted in Wargaming effectively **training** its player base to dismiss anything positive. When something good happens, it’s met with skepticism because past experiences tell us it won’t last.

I also think this conditioning has led to some other interesting perceptions and behaviors that we see almost everyday if you follow WoT content: 

# The “Fix Your Game” Phenomenon

Whenever Wargaming posts about a new premium tank on sale (or in development), you will almost always see some variation of the following comments:

**“Buff the Type 5.” “Fix your game.” “Nerf the BZ-176.” “Add more maps.”**

And honestly, I find myself liking those comments, almost instinctively. Even though I KNOW that the post was made by the marketing department and not the development team? Now why do players keep making these comments ad nauseum? And why do I always find myself liking them? Simple. Because the game has long-standing problems that haven’t been addressed, while the marketing team aggressively pushes new premium sales. That’s where the company's focus seems to always be. 

The problem is that most players don’t see Wargaming as a collection of different departments—**marketing, development, balance, community management** (bless you guys), etc.—they see **one entity** that has consistently prioritized monetization over game health. But are we really wrong to do this? 

# Marketing and Monetization's Harmful Relationship With Game Development

I believe there are many Players who see marketing and development as a **zero-sum game**—if Wargaming is focusing on monetization, it *must* mean they aren’t working on game improvements. And while that’s not necessarily true, (balance and monetization can obviously exist at the same time), Wargaming’s **own actions reinforce this negative perception** because monetization often does in fact impact gameplay.

**A few examples:**

* The **ELC EVEN 90** is always on sale, which effectively makes every other Tier 8 light tank obsolete, ruining **T8 light tank matchmaking**.
* The **BZ-176 was released in an extremely overpowered state**, reinforcing the idea that balance is thrown to the wayside by the want for more sales. 
* The **constant sale of more powerful premiums year after year** has made many Tier 8 tech tree vehicles (& some old premiums) an absolute pain to play / grind. 

When marketing decisions **actively affect gameplay**, it becomes harder to separate them from development.

# The Broader Context: Wargaming Isn’t In Good Company 

All of this **isn’t happening in a vacuum**. Rampant monetization is a **pattern** we’ve seen across so many other companies in recent years:

* **Netflix hikes and splits its subscriptions** while removing content.
* **Everyday necessities become more expensive** under the guise of “inflation,” when in reality, it’s often just **corporate greed**.
* Starbucks **charging more and more for coffee** also because “inflation”
* **Every company has a subscription now**, even ones that don’t need them…

The point I am driving at is that players aren’t just frustrated with Wargaming—**they’re already distrustful of companies in general** because *this kind of exploitative monetization is everywhere*. And when Wargaming pulls stunts like they did recently, it puts them in very bad company.

Wargaming needs to tread carefully, because if they alienate too many players, they won’t get them back. Ever. Right now, more than ever, they should be working to rebuild trust—not following in the footsteps of companies that are actively driving their customers away.

# Wargaming’s Path Forward: Building Understanding

The biggest issue here is that Wargaming doesn’t seem to **fully grasp** how their marketing **actively damages** player trust in their development efforts.

When players see a loot box event filled with reskins, they’re **less likely** to believe that balance changes were made in good faith. That new content was added for **game health, not just sales**. Or that Wargaming actually cares about improving the game.

The problem isn’t just the marketing itself—it’s the damage it does to the perception of everything else.

# Breaking the Cycle: Why Transparency Isn’t Enough

Part of healing this distrust is being **more forthright and transparent** with players—not just in general, but *especially when it comes to selling stuff*. But even then, a lot of players (myself included) see this as the **bare minimum**. ""Oh great, you didn’t do something exploitative. Nice, want a gold star?""

So I wonder—would transparency alone really move the needle? I don’t think so. What Wargaming really needs is **consistency**. And it’s quite simple:

Firstly, and most importantly, **Make good changes to the game.** Then follow up with monetization that can **offer real value to players**—not just a blatant cash grab. **Be as transparent as possible** and **Stop purely extracting value** **from players**, because it’s insulting and only guarantees this cycle will repeat.

At the end of the day, it’s Wargaming’s choice whether they want to break this toxic cycle—or keep digging the hole deeper.

# The Bottom Line

If Wargaming wants players to recognize their positive changes, they need to stop shooting themselves in the foot.

* **Bad monetization overshadows good development.**
* **Players have been conditioned not to trust them.**
* **Even great updates are forgotten if they’re followed by sleazy sales tactics.**

This year, Wargaming has an unique **opportunity** to **fix this**. They can keep making solid game changes that lead up to September, pair them with monetization that actually respects players, and slowly start to rebuild the trust they’ve spent years destroying.

But if they don’t? Well, we already know how this ends.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

This was written firstly with the intention of being feedback for Wargaming. But also for other players to share their thoughts. 

**Some discussion Questions:** 

What are other examples of WG shooting themselves in the foot after good changes? 

Can you guys think of any examples where you enjoyed giving money to WG, instead of just feeling like you are being milked?

Hi folks, I'm immensely grateful for this thread and this community of good people who just want RELIEF and are willing to share incredible information on their healing journeys.

I am only 25 yrs old but have been struggling with IBS-C/slow motility for 10+ years. It has gotten much worse in the past 2 years, with constant bloating no matter what I eat and even when I wake up without food. I have a bowel movement in the mornings but only after coffee, and I still feel incomplete. I was seeing a highly respected GI doctor in NYC for 1.5 years (others here have seen her), who did several tests and prescribed me doxy twice for my SIBO. Ultimately she said I am chronically constipated and dysbiosis. I've been doing pelvic floor PT for a while and am told I am doing well on that front. I have also been taking Motegrity (a prokinetic) since May, which has only helped trigger a BM but has not helped evacuate me. I have had my bloodwork tested too -- everything looks good except my T3 and ferratin levels are slightly low. So the GI wanted me to try a thyroid medication, which freaked me out because again...I'm only 25. But maybe the thyroid is playing a role in all this...who knows. My T3 levels were normal only a few years ago and I was still dealing with constipation.

I then got a 2nd opinion with a functional medicine doctor at Weill Cornell who I was referred to by my PT (others on this thread have seen him too). He recommended that I don't take the thyroid medication. He takes much more of a ""natural"" approach -- wants me to have warm, mushy foods; do abdominal massages; take powders; eat prunes, etc etc. I take magnesium citrate, triphala powder,every night, and still I am backed up. This doctor doesn't want to prescribe antibiotics for my SIBO, but wants me to do all the lifestyle changes before trying an herbal protocol (biocydin, I believe).

I am frustrated because I have followed these doctors' orders -- both of whom take very different approaches -- and I am getting worse. My bloating and constipation are out of control. I want to get a 3rd opinion from another doctor in NYC, but I find that it seems like there are few people who really know how to get to the root cause AND have good bedside manner. I just want someone who gets it and can really give me relief.",2,1739558153.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I tend to like body and complexity over clarity, and I use light to dark.

So I have been looking to get a good hand grinder for a while (upgrading finally from one of those awful blade grinders), and am trying to decide between the X Ultra, J Ultra, and K Ultra, and have spent a lot of time researching my options.

This will be used both at home and on the road while touring around.  The key is I can only have one grinder, and I want it to be capable of doing a range of coffees at least decently.  I tend to like my coffee with some body and complexity of flavor -I am not super obsessed with clarity.  I also tend drink medium/dark roasts with the occasional light roast.  Workflow is not hugely important (we are talking 1-2 coffees per day at most, and occasionally grinding for up to 4 people a few times per year).

I am mainly looking at espresso and aeropress or immersion dripper, with the occasional french press, possibly moka later, occasional turkish, and maybe pourover once in a while.  I am also currently trying to pick a portable espresso maker for both home/on the road (contenders are leverpresso pro, flair pro 3 (a bit too big), picopresso, or the staressso plus, if that helps) to pair with this grinder.

I know the X Ultra is a popular candidate for general use & travel.  But my concern with it is it does not seem to have a way of easily keeping track of what rotation it is on without taking notes, which could be an annoyance as I may be doing espresso one day, dripper/aeropress the next, and I am not sure I would want to have to reset it each and every time I don't remember what I set it too last.

The J Ultra is of interest to me, since it seems to focus on the finer side of grinding, but I am not sure if it can do decent enough french press.  I know it is not at all ideal for pourover.  I do like that I can keep track of the number of rotations it is currently set to, and it should from what I understand do great espresso and good aeropress (immersion dripper as well?).

The K Ultra I am the most uncertain about, first of all it is priced a lot higher (really not sure why it costs 1.26 times what the J Ultra does), second I am not sure it can do espresso particularly well (my understanding is it is general use slanted to pourover, and that it can grind espresso, but lacks in the ability to dial it in), and that it tends to be more on the clarity side of things.  I do like that all the settings are on one round of the device.  Is this really worth looking at over the X or J?

Anyway, My main candidates seem to be between the X and the J, really not sure about the value the K brings over the other two for my uses (especially for the price difference).  Would the J be the better choice, or the X?",2,1739558090.0,1zpresso,1,1.0,False

I’ve been there—more times than I’d like to admit. But I noticed something wild: whenever I pause and focus on **at least one thing I’m truly grateful for**, my day tends to turn around. It’s like flipping a switch that powers you up with positivity.

So, why does gratitude matter so much?

- **It reframes your day**  
  Instead of dwelling on what’s going wrong, you start seeing opportunities. Missed the bus? Maybe that 10-minute walk did wonders for your mind (and your legs).
  
- **It gives you perspective**  
  Has anyone else found themselves scrolling Instagram, feeling envious of someone else’s perfect life—complete with avocado toast? Gratitude keeps you grounded: you see your own wins, big or small, and realize you already have more blessings than you first thought.

- **It builds resilience**  
  Life throws curveballs (always at the worst possible timing, right?). Being thankful, even for small things like a comfy bed to crash in at night, can help you bounce back faster when the unexpected happens.

**But how do you practice gratitude when you’re ridiculously busy?**  
- Keep a gratitude journal. Even if it’s just three bullet points scribbled before bedtime, it helps you reflect on the positive in your day.  
- Give random “thank you” notes or texts to friends, family, or even that coworker who showed you a new trick in Excel.  
- Try a “gratitude walk” and notice all the little things—like that brilliant sunset or the snazzy new coffee shop that makes your favorite latte.  

It’s amazing how a small shift toward gratitude can set the tone for your whole day. You might even start looking forward to those moments you can say, “Wow, life isn’t perfect, but I’m glad for what I do have.” Feels kind of empowering, right?

**So here’s my question:** what’s one thing, big or small, that you’re thankful for today?

Looking for other's experiences with treatment options. I am 39 and have two children.  I was diagnosed with PMDD while in my 20s; since having children, my periods have been so heavy I’m left faint and fatigued every month. I have extreme moodiness with irritability, anger, and anxiety.  I imagine I’ve had the same experience with treatment options as most women. I suspect you might get relief from one symptom, but then you experience an adverse reaction and find a new issue.

I've tried many different SSRIs, but that left me with other unbearable side effects – jaw pain, NO libido, lack of interest, brain zaps, weight gain, etc. I did have one doctor who recommended Zoloft with Wellbutrin to combat the side effects, but I didn’t want to be dependent on those if I could help it.  Thoughts?

Recently I’ve seen a functional doctor who’s prescribed a shit ton of vitamins – anyone who’s experienced PMDD knows there is no amount or type of vitamins that can fix this problem. I do eat mostly whole foods prepared at home, some coffee, and occasional wine.

The same functional doctor prescribed progesterone with and without DHEA. Progesterone 75mg days 5-13 and 225 progesterone days 14-25.  Once I started the progesterone, I noticed an immediate increase in anxiety, specifically driving anxiety.  I’ve had anxiety for years, but the SSRI took care of that for the most part. I haven’t been on them for two years now.  The anxiety is back, and it's terrible. **I’ve read that some women cannot tolerate a low dose of progesterone, but a high dose might actually be tolerable and beneficial.** Does anyone have experience with different doses?

I was on birth control for many years in my twenties with varying results.  I’ve read on the IAPMD website that Yaz and similar drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives could be helpful.  I guess I could give that a try.  Any experiences with this increasing or decreasing anxiety? Libido?

Anyone have success or feedback with **5a-reductase inhibitors, high-dose progesterone,** or **continuous estradiol - plus progestogen?**

I would love to hear your feedback on successful treatment results that have worked for you. ",1,1739558034.0,PMDD,1,1.0,False

They looked good on paper to tick the boxes to get into training however lack communication skills , have no clue how to manage their on calls and are becoming a nightmare to manage. 


They had visa issues and started their training post 2 months late. They missed induction and were placed on calls 2 days after landing in the UK. They never communicated to the rota team ( normally IMGs in trust grade posts get a period of shadowing ) 


They have struggled with their portfolio. It has been almost 8 months whereas their fellow GPST1s ( including IMGs who worked as trust grades for at least 2 years ) are on track. 

This GPST is struggling at home ( brought their kids and spouse here- spouse has passed PLAB exams but can't get a job ) , has 2 small kids , one of them is starting school soon. The family struggled to rent initially and spent 100s of pounds on bed and breakfasts / Hotels / public transport. And out of desperation found a place to rent which is a 45 min taxi ride each way. Due to their expenses , they cannot go less than full time.


They have a completely blank portfolio. A lot of their colleagues and nurses have raised concerns about them and as I am their CS , I am trying my best to help them. 
None of the team on the ward have anything positive to say about them. 


I have gone to extremes to go through their portfolio in detail and spent at least 2 hours each week helping them get assessments but despite this they are struggling. I have spoon fed them everything as leaving them be wasn't working. 


I spoke to their Educational Supervisor and programme director. The TPD is good friend and mentioned to me that IMGs new to the NHS have been struggling a lot and many TPDs have raised this to NHS England’s Workforce, Training and Education Directorate however NHS E hasn't responded to any emails. When this was raised in their trainee committee meetings , it was fedback that they will look into it. This was 1 year ago. 


Their ES suggested referring them to occupational health however the GPST declined despite multiple reassurances that OH is there to support them and it's not punishment. 


I also buddied them up with another IMG GPST who has 2 years experience in their home country, 2 years NHS experience in the same trust as a trust grade. They were confident and although they were extremely helpful , my GPST trainee felt very discouraged ( I presume  they started comparing themselves to that other well settled GPST ). 


I have been spending almost all my SPA time on this trainee - i have tried becoming friendly by doing ""coffee chats"", have buddied them up , reassured everyone that they are not a bad doctor - it's just bad circumstances. 


I really feel for this lovely doctor. They were doing really well in their home country. I supervise IMGs regularly and it breaks my heart how they are misguided and told that everything will be fine.  


I presume this GPST will get an adverse outcome in their ARCP - likely an extension instead of being released from training and I can only hope that with time they settle in.  


But they are on my ward for the next few months- what else can I do ? I have other trainees too and I have only 0.25 programmed activities ( 30 min per week) for this. The trust has declined more PAs for this.

    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iphajn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1iphajn/how_to_keep_marriage_going_after_21_years/,How To Keep Marriage Going after 21 years,"Here's a little story that may inspire a few fellow husbands:

At the start of the year, I bought one of those giant wall calendars that lays out the entire year. I immediately noted all important events, birthdays, anniversaries, and of course, Valentine's Day. 

Next to my desk is a big whiteboard where I make notes to myself and keep track of the most important things I need to get done. So at the end of last week,  I  made a note in RED  that Friday is Valentine's Day. 

I suppose a few people are asking, do you really need two reminders? And all I can say is yes, between being a husband, father, running a business, and taking care of employees, my brain can be easily distracted by the demands of the week. 

Thursday afternoon, I see my notes reminding me I have very little time left to plan. While running to pick up the elder kid for school, I stop and buy a card and flowers along the way. 

I get home, but it's not Valentine's Day yet. So I left the flowers in the car. I know, that's bad, but the temperature was in the 50s, so I knew they wouldn't go bad too quickly 

Then, wait until she's distracted. Ah, she's taking a bath, perfect. 

Get a vase, run out to the car and get the flowers, put the flowers in the vase with some water, and fill out the card. Then, leave it in the garage. 

The next morning, our alarms go off at 6 am. She hits snooze; I jump out of bed. I get her a cup of coffee (I set the coffee pot the night before). Then, I go to the garage and retrieve the flowers and the card, and put it all on her nightstand. When she wakes up, she'll find coffee, flowers and a card. 

So what happens next? Well, nothing in particular. I go about my day. And that's the point. Expect nothing in return. Marriage is about giving and not waiting for something in return.

Now to plan dinner!

- Distinction in undergrad (BBA) - studied in Italy with exchange semesters in Finland and Denmark 
- Came in first in two extracurricular competitions 
- Was in a leadership position at our student fund
- CFA Level 1 passed
- Lacking solid internship experience
- Had coffee chats with 110+ professionals across Canada
- Applied to 1000+ places
- 25-30 interviews


Following are notable job interviews I gave and their outcomes:

Equity Research Associate at RBC Capital Markets:
Made it to the 3rd round interview (total time taken 3-4 months and had to send email twice just to get a rejection email)

Equity Research Associate at TD Securities: 
Made it to the 4th (final round) interview.
Got referred for another opening in a different team. Gave two more interviews only to be rejected again.
Got referred for another opening. Gave one more interview only to be rejected again.
(Total time taken: 6 months)

Equity Research Associate at BMO Capital Markets:
Made it to the 2nd round (held on 24th January) and now completely ghosted. I emailed 3 different people I met during the interview and no one responded. 

I don’t think I have felt so low in my life. I don’t know if it is normal to be treated like this especially when you have made it past the first round. I am really questioning my decision to come to Canada and study at McGill (apologies if this offends anyone - that is not the intention). I know the job market is tough right now but I do think that my Muslim/foreign name and the colour of my skin has something to do with it as well. I saw a lot of my white Canadian classmates land really good roles while all the international students in my class are either working at a sub par role or still struggling to land a role. 

I really don’t know what to do. I have no energy left to network and go on coffee chats anymore. Sometimes I feel like making a LinkedIn post or YouTube video describing all this but I don’t know what I will achieve from that. That is why I’m venting out here. I would love to hear some feedback from you guys.

I was also thinking that maybe we can form a group where all those struggling to find a job and maybe have some entrepreneurial spirit in them can meet up for a coffee and brainstorm some ideas for starting a business. Idk how feasible this would be but would love to get some feedback.

Thank you!

Everything was wonderful at the beginning. I’ve thought I’ve met the sweetest, funniest, thoughtful man ever. We used to have a lot of fun together, although I felt that things were moving too fast at certain times. 

Everything was nice, till he started questioning me about my past bf, friends, even getting jealous out o nowhere about a guy I’ve used being friends with. Every week he started to tell me that he dreamt that I was cheating on him or seeing guys behind his back when we were at the beginning. He also asked me why I hide some notifications on my phone from him, even though I was only checking the weather at 6 o’clock in the morning. 

We live in my apartment and I’ve always reffered it as our home, not mine. It took me long talks to make him understant that he has to help me clean and cook. Now he helps me sometimes with cleaning, but usually I have to remind him to do the things he said he will do. 

If I am late from work he tells me stuff like “oh, you’ve stopped to shop” or “the trip back home was longer than usual”. He always asks me for pictures, when I get home and if I don’t answer his messages he calls me. If I don’t respond, he assumes something bad has happened to me. I must add that his parents died when he was a teenager. 

Fastforward to the last couple of months when I’ve told him “no” to sex because of cramps, or being tired (I have a very demanding job) and he usually gets upset and asks me if it’s something wrong with him. Once I’ve told him I have an UTI, but he still initiated sex. I didn’t have the energy to justify why I don’t want sex. My fault, I guess. 

Last time it was early in the morning and he wanted sex. I’ve told him no, because before coffee it usually lasts too long for me and he usually loses his erection. He got really mad telling me that he can prove me that it’s not the case. I wanted to leave the room, but he started throwing tantrums. I gave up, got back to bed and we had sex. I felt like an object, abused. 

Now he wants me to forgive him, crying, demanding physical touch. I feel like I am going crazy. That it’s also my fault for what happened. At the same time, I am feeling controlled and abused, but in a way I still love him. I am really lost. I don’t know if it was my fault. 

TL;DR: I [F,29] been with bf [M,30] for about a year. I feel he is very controlling and somehow forces being intimate with him. I also feel like it’s my fault and I am very confused. I don’t really know how to proceed and how to think about this situation. I feel that he is not inherently bad, but I can’t shake being uneasy around him now.

Here’s what happened. I was driving to a new cafe that a friend had recommended, minding my own business, sipping on my iced coffee, vibing to my playlist like I’m in a music video. Everything was chill, until my GPS suddenly went “turn left.” I was like okay, cool, no problem. I turned left, and bam, immediate regret. I ended up on a one-way street, and as soon as I realized it, i was stuck with cars approaching from the other direction. Not every one-way street is super obvious, especially in an unfamiliar area. The road I was on wasn’t clearly marked and wasn’t narrow, so it wasn’t obvious in that moment. As soon as I turned, I realized, but by then, I was already committed. People started honking, and I was just sitting there frozen, gripping my steering wheel like it’s a lifeline, while my GPS stayed silent, no recalculating, no apology…just quiet, probably laughing at my misery.

A few days later, I was cruising down the highway, peacefully munching on some fries, when my GPS confidently ordered “take the next exit.” Seems simple right? Except, there was no exit. Just a giant concrete wall. I don’t know if it expected me to phase through solid matter or take an early trip to the afterlife, but there I was staring at a dead end, wishing i could just disappear.

And my personal favorite? Just this morning, my GPS cheerfully said “you have arrived.” I thought, finally maybe this thing’s got it all togethet. But no. I hadn’t arrived at the cute little bookstore I was expecting. Instead, I found myself parked in front of an abandoned warehouse that looked like it was either haunted or the headquarters of an underground fight club. I just sat there for a sec, sipping my drink, thinking...well, guess this is my life now.

Honestly, I just have the worst luck with directions. And to make it worse, all of these happened in areas I’d never been before. It was my first time in each of these places, and I couldn’t even get a heads up from my GPS. Some of the turns were so tricky, and it was hard to know if I was on the right track until I was already too far in.

But hey, I’ll keep going. Hopefully, tomorrow will be a little less chaotic.

Just needed to vent. It’s been a rough week with this thing. Fingers crossed, i won’t end up in a lake tomorrow.

TLDR- My GPS went rogue, nearly crashed, took me to a wall, and left me at a haunted warehouse. Maybe I should’ve just stayed home and binge-watched Netflix. What a trip.",3,1739557330.0,tifu,16,0.59,False

Yesterday was absolutely insane day for Noah’s lives. He posted 2 Lives. The first one was 54:38 long. The second was an outstanding 151:52. 

With that being said I am leaving the second Live in the communities hands. I do not have the time to cover all of that. 

Live 1: 54:38 

2:00 Some random guy joins Noah’s Live and Noah is the sane one between the two. The guy is trying to convince Noah to “take matters into his own hands” when it comes to Noah’s situation. 

3:00-9:00 Noah is actually kinda clear minded here for awhile. Noah gives a monologue on his beliefs and is speaking very positively here. This is the best I’ve seen from Noah ever. He speaks on being his authentic self, and how he is going to focus on his goals. 

9:00 “It’s not about the money you make it’s about the person you become in the process” 

Noah says that when he does obtain wealth he will file lawsuits. For “Justice”. 

Noah might be becoming Batman. 

10:00 “I pray for those who oppose me” 

Noah is on his super hero homeless arc. 

I do hope that this live is a turn around for Noah. Normally I watch these videos ready to type out things that Noah has done that make me laugh but this live Noah is absolutely locked in. 

12:00 Noah claims the following 

He had put in 140 applications on indeed alone. This is not counting other websites 
He had gone to 89 Interviews 
Back ground check 
3 violations

13:00-16:00
Noah says things are fine with mom and grandma. He stayed there last night and went to get coffee with his grandma the following morning. So this goes against what Dixie has said. 

This is good news for Noah. 

He used to work at Jack in the box until Brandon Hansen came to his work and TPd his truck. He was then “discharged because I couldn’t ensure the saftey of my workers”. This does make sense. 

Noah also says that he got into an argument with Brandon Hansen at Jack in the Box. It is possible Noah handled this situation really poorly. Which could have also led to his dismissal. 

However Noah has said he’s on the spectrum and sometimes it can be more difficult for people on the spectrum to control their reactions. So either way it’s in very poor taste for a man to come and TP a man’s truck while he’s at his place of business. 

16:00 Noah claims here that he was exposing Eddie in the family group chat. 

Then Eddie came to Noah’s house smashed Noah’s chest. Eddie allegedly kicked his dog then threatened to kill his dog.

The police were called and Noah has said he dead asked if he’d like to press charges and Noah said no. This is class from Noah. 

Eddie then backed his truck into Noahs trailer. This might have been the same trailer that Noahs grandmother got him I believe. 

17:00 Noah stands on business when it comes to standing up to Eddies father who is the one to have allegedly done inappropriate things with family members. Noah believes that Eddie is taking up for his father. 

Once again pretty clear here for Noah. 

Much more coherent than previous lives. 

18:00-24:00 Noah proceeds to read his Bible. 

25:00 Noah is worried about the feds that have been circling him. So he’s gotta “step”.

Followed up by another classic freestyle. 
Noah serves up these freestyles like a 7 year old playing Popa’s Pizzeria. 

26:00 Noah when saying he needed to “step” said he wasn’t going to say where he was going because the feds were watching his live. But he then quickly says he’s going to Taco Bell. Not very secretive Noah. 

27:00 Noah references the infamous Picks and Licks from a previous live. 

28:00 “Eddie likes to cheek clapage his kids”

33:00 Noah sets up for a game of chess against Luke

54:00 The match ends and Noah is victorious! I really like to see Noah putting his brain to work here. So much better than the penjamin. I would however like to see Noah and Luke play chess off dat penjamin. 

54:25 Evil Laugh 

Now we are onto the Second Live. As previously stated I’m leaving this live in the communities hand for the most part. I will skim through and get to all the good stuff. Please add events with time stamps if I miss anything good. 

Live 2: 151:52

8:00 Noah and Luke fight is always a good watch. During this fight Noah is free styling! What a combo here! 

9:20 “I got more cartilage in my bones” alright Noah

15:00 Freestyle Continues

23:00 Noah says he applied for a restaurant Job

27:00 Cig is lit! Love the Lucky Strike. I feel as if now in addicted to cigs. I’ve started getting that itch whenever he doesn’t smoke. It’s as if I’m a cigarette smoker but I can only get my fix watching Noah light up. Let me know if the community feels the same on this one


50:00-55:00 Just some good Dog content here. 

65:00 Noah getting all nice and toasty with a fire. This is kinda legendary. Smoking a cig in the garage with a fire going does kinda sound nice. 

Around this time Noah muted himself again. He just keeps playin the hits! 

86:00 Noah just makin some food and eating it here

92:00 Noah Luke fight again 

99:00 Noah makes Luke Tap out. (Who’s the loser now luke? Certaintly not news anchor)

105:00 Shirtless Noah 

112:00 Cig in the bed. Outstanding! 

The rest of the Live he’s just chilling in the bed. 

So community I’m not sure if the Dixie interaction was in this Live. I couldn’t find it. 

However yesterday I did join Noah’s live and if you could take anyway anything from everything I’ve put out today please let it be this. I left the Live because I wanted to get the full video in context before I reported but apparently that’s not an option. 

On Noah’s live yesterday dixie joined and Noah stands on business. He goes directly at the Hansen name in all the ways he has before. Noah goes in on Dixie about the fact there are inappropriate relations going on within the Hansen family. Dixie’s response was “No comment”. 

This shows me that Noah is not just making these things up. 

I’m really unsure why Noah wouldn’t post this.

1iph2z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/YTEntitledFiles/comments/1iph2z8/hoa_karen_wages_war_against_veterans_american/,HOA Karen Wages War Against Veteran's American Flag... BIG Mistake,"There are two types of people in this world: those who mind their own business and those who are the business. Unfortunately, my Homeowners' Association (HOA) president, Patricia Greer—self-appointed queen of our suburban nightmare—was the latter.

She wasn't always this way, according to my neighbor Bob, who'd lived in Maple Grove Estates for twenty years. ""Used to be normal,"" he told me over the fence one day, voice hushed like he was sharing state secrets. ""Then her husband left her for a yoga instructor, and well..."" He made a spiraling motion with his finger.

Patricia transformed from a regular suburban mom into the neighborhood's self-appointed dictator. Her physical transformation was equally dramatic—trading in her casual wear for an endless parade of beige pantsuits, cutting her once-long hair into that iconic Karen bob with frosted tips, and permanently affixing an expression that suggested she was perpetually smelling spoiled dairy.

That's where I come in. Name's Mike Dawson, retired Army veteran, twenty years of service, three tours in Afghanistan, and the poor sucker who made the mistake of buying a home in her domain. After years of military discipline, I thought I knew everything about following rules. But Patricia's rules? They made military regulations look like friendly suggestions.

I should've known something was off during the home viewing. The real estate agent kept nervously glancing at her watch, rushing me through rooms, and whispering something about ""approved viewing hours."" But the house was perfect—three bedrooms, a massive garage for my tools, and most importantly, a price I could afford on my military pension.

The closing went smoothly, and I moved in on a sunny Saturday in April. My sister Sarah helped me unpack, commenting on how quiet and clean the neighborhood was. ""Almost too quiet,"" she joked. ""Like one of those horror movies where everything looks perfect until the bodies start piling up.""

She wasn't far off.

My first week in Maple Grove Estates was deceivingly peaceful. I spent it unpacking, arranging furniture, and setting up my workshop in the garage. The neighbors seemed friendly enough—though I noticed they kept their conversations brief and kept glancing over their shoulders, like they were afraid of being caught socializing.

On day six, I hung up my American flag. It wasn't anything extraordinary—a 3x5 foot standard flag that had traveled with me through three different states and seven different homes. This particular flag held special meaning; it was given to me by my unit after my last tour. The sight of those stars and stripes gently waving in the breeze made my new house feel like home.

That peace lasted exactly 47 hours.

I was enjoying my morning coffee on the front porch when I spotted her—Patricia Greer, power-walking down the sidewalk in a beige pantsuit that somehow matched both her shoes and her clipboard. She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw my flag, her face contorting like she'd bitten into a lemon.

The next morning, I found an official-looking notice taped to my mailbox. The paper was expensive cardstock, and the HOA logo was embossed in gold—because apparently, regular paper wasn't fancy enough for violations.

 

 VIOLATION NOTICE

Your property is in breach of HOA regulations due to an unauthorized external decoration. Remove it within 48 hours to avoid fines.

First Offense: $150

Second Offense: $300

Third Offense: Board Review and Possible Lien

Sincerely,

Patricia Greer

HOA President

Maple Grove Estates

 

I read it twice, then a third time, convinced it had to be some sort of joke. My next-door neighbor, Tom, was watering his meticulously maintained roses when I walked over, notice in hand.

""Hey Tom, what's the deal with this?""

He nearly dropped his watering can. ""Oh man, you got flagged already?"" He winced at his unintentional pun. ""Look, Mike, my advice? Just take it down. Patricia... she's relentless. Last year, the Hendersons put up wind chimes. Wind chimes! She cited them for 'noise pollution' until they moved.""

But I wasn't about to back down. Twenty years in the Army taught me to pick my battles—and this was one worth fighting.

I marched inside and dialed the HOA office number. The phone rang twice before that nasally voice answered.

""Greer Residence,"" Patricia answered, as if running an HOA from her living room was completely normal.

""Hi, this is Mike Dawson, new homeowner at—""

""I know who you are,"" she interrupted, her voice dripping with the kind of authority that comes from spending too much time policing other people's lives. ""I was expecting your call. The Anderson's called to inform me about your... installation... the moment it went up.""

Great. She had informants.

""Right. Well, I got this notice about my flag—""

""Yes, you need to take it down immediately. External decorations must be approved by the HOA board,"" she said. I could practically hear her shuffling through papers, probably looking for more rules to cite.

""Patricia,"" I said, keeping my voice level, the way I used to when dealing with particularly difficult superior officers, ""I served under that flag for twenty years. Three tours in Afghanistan. I'd like to see where in the bylaws it says I can't fly it.""

""Article 7, Section 3, Subsection B clearly states there is a strict uniformity clause,"" she snapped. ""If you'd read the rules, you'd know that. We maintain property values through aesthetic consistency.""

""That's interesting,"" I replied, pulling out my own folder. ""Because I've been doing some reading myself. Are you familiar with the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005?""

Silence on the other end.

""It specifically prohibits HOAs from restricting homeowners from displaying the American flag. So unless you want to explain to a judge why you're violating federal law—""

""Fine,"" she huffed, cutting me off. ""Keep your flag. But don't think this means you can just do whatever you want in this neighborhood. There are still rules, Mr. Dawson, and I intend to ensure they're followed.""

The threat in her voice was clear as day.

""Have a nice day, Patricia,"" I said, and hung up.

Later that afternoon, I was fixing my garage door when Bob came over with a six-pack of beer.

""Heard you went toe-to-toe with the dragon lady,"" he said, handing me a cold one. ""Not many people stand up to her anymore. After what happened to the Johnsons...""

""What happened to the Johnsons?""

Bob took a long sip. ""They tried fighting her on the garden gnome ban last summer. Next thing you know, their trash isn't getting picked up, their mail's getting 'lost,' and their kids aren't allowed in the community pool because of some mysterious 'paperwork issue.'"" He shook his head. ""They sold at a loss and moved to Arizona.""

I looked at my flag, still proudly waving in the evening breeze. ""Well, she better get used to disappointment. Because this flag isn't going anywhere.""

""Just watch your back,"" Bob warned. ""Patricia plays dirty. And she's got eyes everywhere.""

As if on cue, Mrs. Anderson across the street quickly ducked behind her curtains when I looked over.

That night, I installed security cameras around my property. Twenty years in the military taught me another valuable lesson: always secure your position when you're in hostile territory.

And make no mistake—I was in hostile territory.

Two peaceful weeks passed—well, as peaceful as things could be with Patricia's minions documenting my every move. I caught Mrs. Anderson photographing my house no less than six times, and the retired couple next door suddenly developed an intense interest in power-walking past my driveway multiple times a day.

Then came the truck incident.

My Ford F-250 had been with me longer than most relationships. Desert tan, a few battle scars, but reliable as the day is long. I used it for everything—hauling supplies for my woodworking projects, helping neighbors move (the ones brave enough to accept), and towing my small fishing boat on weekends.

One morning, I found another one of Patricia's gold-embossed notices fluttering under my windshield wiper:

 

VIOLATION NOTICE

 

Personal vehicles must be stored in the garage overnight. Oversized trucks are not allowed in visible driveways. Commercial vehicles are strictly prohibited.

 

Fine Schedule:

First Offense: $200

Second Offense: $400

Third Offense: Vehicle Subject to Towing

 

Additional Note: All modifications (including after-market accessories) must be approved by the Board.

 

Sincerely,

Patricia Greer

HOA President

Maple Grove Estates

 

I surveyed the street. Dr. Morrison's BMW sat in his driveway. The Wilsons had two SUVs parked outside. Even Patricia's precious Mercedes was visible from the street.

This was targeted harassment, plain and simple.

I grabbed my phone and dialed the now-familiar number.

""Mike,"" she sighed dramatically before I could speak. ""Are you really going to argue about this too?""

""You're damn right I am,"" I said. ""I've counted seven other vehicles parked in driveways on this street alone.""

""Yes, but yours is an eyesore,"" she spat the word like it was poison. ""This isn't some military base. We have standards.""

""It's a Ford, Patricia, not a Humvee. And unless you're planning to cite everyone else with a vehicle in their driveway—""

""We are a community of aesthetic harmony,"" she interrupted, her voice rising to that particular pitch that made dogs howl. ""And your military-style vehicle—""

""Show me where in the bylaws it specifically prohibits trucks.""

""Article 9, Section—""

""The actual clause, Patricia. Not some vague reference you're reinterpreting.""

The silence was deafening.

""I'll have the Board review this matter,"" she finally said.

""You do that. In the meantime, my truck stays where it is.""

That evening, Bob came over with more beer and news.

""She's called an emergency Board meeting,"" he said, settling into one of my porch chairs. ""Tomorrow night at her house. Heard she's trying to push through a new vehicle regulation.""

I took a long pull from my beer. ""Who's on this Board anyway?""

""Patricia, obviously. Mrs. Anderson—no surprise there. Dr. Morrison, but he never shows up. And..."" Bob looked sheepish. ""Me.""

I nearly choked on my beer. ""You're on the Board?""

""Keep your enemies closer, right?"" He winked. ""Someone's got to be the voice of reason. Though usually, I'm outvoted.""

The next morning, my security cameras caught Patricia herself measuring my truck with a tape measure at 5:30 AM. She was wearing what appeared to be tactical black clothing, as if she was on some covert HOA mission.

That's when I decided to up the ante.

I drove to the auto parts store and bought the biggest American flag mount they had. By noon, Old Glory was proudly flying from the back of my truck, visible from three blocks away.

The text from Bob came within the hour: ""Emergency Board meeting cancelled. P is having what the Anderson's are calling 'an episode.'""

 

Patricia's retaliation came swiftly and, quite literally, under cover of darkness.

It started with whispers. Walking down the street, I'd catch fragments of conversations: ""Did you see Dawson's lawn?"" ""Such a shame..."" ""Bringing down property values...""

My lawn was immaculate—20 years of military precision doesn't disappear in civilian life. I mowed in perfect lines, edged weekly, and maintained a watering schedule that would make a botanist proud. But suddenly, neighbors were looking at my yard like it was a toxic waste dump.

Then came the anonymous ""helpful"" notes in my mailbox:

""Lawn care services recommendation! Call Patricia for details!""

""Your grass seems stressed. The HOA's approved landscaper can help!""

""Consider professional intervention before it's too late!""

 

I threw them all away. But on Wednesday morning, at precisely 6:17 AM (according to my security footage), everything changed.

I was doing my morning PT routine when I heard the distinctive sound of a spray tank. Through my window, I spotted a figure in a neon yellow vest methodically spraying something on my lawn.

I burst out the front door, still in my workout clothes. ""Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?""

The guy—barely old enough to buy beer—practically jumped out of his skin. His name tag read ""Tyler.""

""Uh, the HOA sent me. Said your grass was too patchy and needed treatment."" He gestured vaguely with the sprayer, looking like he wanted to disappear.

""Patchy?"" I walked onto my pristine lawn. ""Show me exactly where.""

""Well, uh..."" Tyler shuffled uncomfortably. ""Mrs. Greer said it was preventative. For the, uh, fungus problem.""

""What fungus problem?""

""The one she said is spreading through the neighborhood?"" His voice went up at the end, making it sound more like a question than a statement.

That's when I noticed something peculiar. Through the morning mist, I could see strange patterns emerging on lawns up and down the street—brown patches in otherwise healthy grass. They appeared random unless you knew what to look for: targeted chemical burns designed to look like natural damage.

""Tyler,"" I said, using my calm-but-serious sergeant voice, ""what exactly are you spraying?""

He looked at the tank, then at me, then back at the tank. ""Mrs. Greer provides the solution. Says it's proprietary.""

""Does this 'proprietary solution' have proper EPA registration?""

Tyler's face went white.

""I'd suggest you pack up and leave. Now. And Tyler?"" I called as he hastily began gathering his equipment. ""You might want to find a new job. One that doesn't involve illegal chemical applications.""

He practically ran to his truck.

I took samples from the spots he'd sprayed and photos of the ""mysterious"" dead patches appearing throughout the neighborhood. Then I marched straight to Patricia's house, evidence in hand.

Her house was exactly what you'd expect: beige on beige with carefully cultivated roses and a ""Blessed"" sign hanging above her door. I knocked firmly.

The door opened, and there stood Patricia in her morning glory—a silk robe over what appeared to be a tennis outfit, clutching a ""World's Best HOA President"" mug that she'd probably bought herself.

""Can I help you?"" Her smile was as fake as her frosted tips.

""You sent someone to mess with my lawn.""

""I sent someone to help with your subpar landscaping,"" she corrected, taking a sip from her mug. ""The Board is very concerned about the declining standards in the neighborhood.""

""The only decline I see is where your hired guy is poisoning people's lawns.""

Her smile flickered. ""That's a serious accusation, Mr. Dawson. One that could be considered defamatory.""

""Funny you should mention legal terms,"" I said, pulling out my phone. ""Because I've got some interesting footage to share with the EPA and the County Environmental Board. Not to mention the police.""

 

For the first time, I saw real fear crack through her perfectly maintained facade.

They say revenge is a dish best served cold. In Patricia's case, it was served with a side of perfectly organized paperwork and enough documentation to bury her HOA career six feet under.

First, I did my reconnaissance. Twenty years in the military teaches you to gather intelligence before launching an offensive. I started with Bob, my man on the inside.

""The HOA financial records,"" I asked him over beers one evening. ""Where are they kept?""

Bob grinned. ""Funny you should ask. As Board treasurer—even though Patricia never lets me actually handle anything—I'm supposed to have access. But..."" He pulled out a thick folder from his briefcase. ""I've been keeping my own records. Every receipt, every expenditure she's tried to hide.""

The documents told a story that would make an IRS auditor salivate:

\- $15,000 for ""landscape maintenance"" that mysteriously aligned with Patricia's new backyard renovation

\- $10,000 for ""security services"" that consisted of her nephew driving around in a golf cart

\- $25,000 for ""community improvements"" that all seemed to center around her property

\- Countless smaller expenses for ""office supplies"" delivered to high-end boutiques

 

But I needed more. So I went door to door, building my case and my support base.

The Hendersons shared documentation of false violations that disappeared after ""private consultations"" with Patricia. Mrs. Johnson, who'd been denied pool access for her kids, provided emails showing Patricia had altered their application dates. Even Dr. Morrison, the absent Board member, had a story about ""donations"" required for architectural approvals.

Then came the annual HOA meeting. Patricia had scheduled it for 2 PM on a Wednesday—when most people would be at work. She didn't expect half the neighborhood to show up, much less with me leading the charge.

The community center was packed. Patricia sat at her little throne—actually, a slightly larger chair she'd specially ordered with HOA funds—looking confused as people kept filing in.

 

""Before we begin,"" she started, shuffling her papers importantly, ""I'd like to address the recent concerns about property values—""

""Point of order,"" I stood up, my voice carrying through the room like I was back on the parade ground. ""According to HOA bylaws, we need to address any member-submitted agenda items first.""

Patricia's perfectly plucked eyebrows drew together. ""I haven't received any agenda items.""

""Check your email,"" I smiled. ""Sent certified mail too, just to be safe.""

She glanced at her phone, face growing paler by the second.

""Now then,"" I continued, setting up my laptop and projector—another military habit: always be prepared. ""Let's talk about financial accountability.""

For the next thirty minutes, I laid out everything: the misappropriated funds, the selective enforcement, the illegal landscaping scheme, even the private security force that was really just her nephew playing cop.

""This is slander!"" Patricia screeched, standing up so fast her special chair toppled backward. ""I'll sue!""

""Actually,"" came a voice from the back, ""it's all public record."" A man in a suit stepped forward. ""John Martinez, County District Attorney's office. We've been very interested in Mrs. Greer's creative accounting.""

Patricia's face went through several interesting colors before settling on a sickly shade of gray.

""I move for an immediate Board election,"" Bob called out, right on cue.

""Seconded!"" came a chorus of voices.

""This is ridiculous!"" Patricia stammered. ""You can't just—""

""Article 4, Section 7 of the bylaws,"" I quoted. ""Members can call for emergency Board elections with a two-thirds majority vote. Shall we count hands?""

The vote wasn't even close. Patricia Greer's reign as HOA queen ended in a landslide, with yours truly elected as the new president.

The aftermath of Patricia's dethroning was both swift and satisfying. Within 24 hours, her precious ""World's Best HOA President"" mug was packed away, along with her collection of violation notice templates and her gold-embossed letterhead.

My first act as president? Establishing the ""Common Sense Committee""—a group of reasonable homeowners tasked with reviewing and revising every single one of Patricia's ridiculous rules. We called it ""The Great Purge.""

Out went:

\- The ban on garden gnomes

\- The ""approved colors"" paint chart (which, suspiciously, consisted of various shades of beige)

\- The ""aesthetic harmony"" clause

\- The ""mandatory landscaping service"" requirement

\- And about fifty other petty regulations

 

In came:

\- Transparent financial reporting

\- Democratic decision-making processes

\- A reasonable approach to property maintenance

\- And most importantly, a ""Mind Your Own Business"" clause

 

But the real justice came from the county investigation. Turns out, the District Attorney's office had been building a case against Patricia for months. The evidence I gathered was just the final nail in her beige coffin.

The headlines in the local paper said it all:

""HOA President Charged with Embezzlement: 'Queen of the Cul-de-sac' Faces Multiple Counts of Financial Misconduct""

 

Patricia was ordered to pay back $157,000 in misappropriated funds, plus fines. Her Mercedes disappeared from the driveway, replaced by a used Hyundai. The pantsuits gave way to sweatpants, and her perfectly manicured lawn—well, let's just say it's amazing how quickly grass dies when you can't afford to illegally poison your neighbors' yards anymore.

The neighborhood transformed. Kids started playing outside again. People actually talked to their neighbors. The Hendersons put their wind chimes back up. Mrs. Johnson's children splashed happily in the community pool. Someone even painted their door fire-engine red—and the world didn't end.

My flag still flies proudly, now joined by several others along the street. My truck sits in the driveway, occasionally accompanied by a boat or a trailer, and nobody files a complaint. The grass grows, people mow it, and somehow property values haven't plummeted into the abyss as Patricia predicted.

I still see her sometimes, power-walking past my house in her discount store activewear. She always glares at my flag, my truck, my perfectly normal lawn. And I always wave, usually while sitting in my front yard on a non-HOA-approved lawn chair, drinking a beer at an unapproved time of day.

Last week, Bob and I installed a new sign at the neighborhood entrance. Under ""Welcome to Maple Grove Estates,"" it reads:

""A Community of Neighbors, Not Rules""

 

Patricia drove past as we were putting it up. I swear I saw her eye twitch.

But the best part? Every Fourth of July now, we have a neighborhood-wide flag display. This year, I might even put up two.

Because sometimes the best revenge isn't just winning—it's creating something better from the ashes of tyranny.

And that, my friends, is how you take down an HOA Karen.

I just want to be normal. I want to be able to not have to pinch myself everytime someone at work initiates conversation, I want to stop overthinking and I want to initiate social stuff. 

Here's what I've tried:

1. ""Just expose yourself to situations""
I have a 40hr work week with 60% as a programmer and 40% attending university. At work, I have chill coworkers and like them. But I HATE talking to them in non-work contexts. Lunch is the worst time of the day, so is grabbing a coffee. I just want to work but this job forces me to be social so I obviously am, but I hate every minute of it and I've been working here for months now. Meanwhile at uni I have some friends and I'm quite talkative and its a bit more bearable but thats just status quo, nothing improved. And I can't make them more than uni friends cause of said anxiety. Like when I say I can't bc of my anxiety, it might as well be ""I physically cannot"".

2. ""Take small steps""
Yeah so the smallest step I can take is a step that doesn't leave my comfort zone. It might as well be binary: anxiety inducing or not.

3. ""Challenge underlying issues""
Easier said than done. Tell me how to challenge whatever the fuck is wrong with me, when I don't know what it is. Is it autism? Or a mental illness? I'm one year clean from self harm but I might as well be doing worse than when I wasn't clean. I completely hate myself and have no self-confidence. Essentially it's not a viable approach.

Here's what I can't do funnily enough BECAUSE of my social anxiety:

1. CBT or prescription medication (too scared to get a therapist, talk to them and do literally anything that involves talking about myself)

2. Seek help through friends


What has worked for me so far?

Alcohol. Literally makes me feel like I'm normal. It's the best solution I've found but obviously not viable in formal situations and also actually in most normal social situations.

1ipgyxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ipgyxt/what_doctor_do_i_see_for_extreme_sensitivity_to/,What doctor do I see for extreme sensitivity to most medications?,"Hi everyone,

I have a constant theme in my life where normal doses of medication are way too high for me, causing a bunch of issues. 

All of these examples below are separate events:

A standard dose of lidocaine (they didn’t tell me how much). Made me immediately dissociated, high, and euphoric. Similar reaction to this study.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519830/


Hydrocodone 2.5mg given after surgery made me pass out and fully lose consciousness. 

This happened after 2 separate surgeries, 10 years apart. It took a while to realize the hydrocodone was the issue as they kept insisting it was a “very low dose”

For context, they switched me to tramadol 50mg and I cut the pill into 4ths, and that gave me adequate pain relief directly after surgery.


Antibiotics literally will make me hallucinate. Both Metronidazole and Clarithromycin caused this to happen. 


I feel like there’s a theme of drugs that shouldn’t be crossing my blood brain barrier, crossing it. 



I haven’t been able to get any doctor to take me seriously. I talked to a neurologist about the blood brain barrier stuff and he hand waved it. I talked to a Gastro as well and he gave me a gene test for drug metabolization. It was semi helpful, but doesn’t give info about the drugs I’ve had issues with. 

This sensitivity is also the case for me with weed and alcohol. I can get extremely high on a 2.5 mg edible (for non partakers, a common dose for adults is 10mg).

With alcohol, I can get drunk off of a single drink. My tolerance has never raised.

I literally can’t have a cup of coffee or I feel like I’m going to die. I feel the effects of the caffeine still in my system the next day.

Does anyone know what type of doctor I should go to for this? In general I want to be able to advocate for myself so whenever I’m given medication, I can say “hey I have this thing, so you have to give me less”. The most recent event was the lidocaine, which seems like it was at CNS toxicity levels, which I’m not thrilled about. I want to make sure I’m not permanently damaging my body. Also would love to fix the blood brain barrier thing so I’m not constantly having psychological effects from medication that isn’t supposed to cause them.

It causes such an issue in my life where every medication seems to reach toxic levels in my body, and gives me extreme side effects. 

Would a doctor that knows about livers and kidneys be a good option?

Also if anyone else can relate, I would love to hear from you too.

1ipgylp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/1ipgylp/cutting_out_some_of_the_lengthwise_decor_support/,"Cutting  out some of the lengthwise decor support on a coffee table  (goes between the left and right legs, under the table top) What power saw should I use?","PICTURE BELOW. I'm making a rectangular cut in the APRON of the table

I have a long coffee table 3.5 to 4 feet made from reclaimed wood that I picked up at a yard sale. It's a wonderful beast and a musician friend has talked about using it as a music stand for few table instruments as the wood helps the sound.

BUT---the APRON, the front length of the table (under the table top) has a long support running length wise 3.5 feet, parallel to the table top but set in a bit . We'd like to cut out some of this wood (U shape or rectangle) to allow feet/ knees to go under the table, sit closer. The wood is a  1x5 or 1x 6 running about 3.5 feet.

I have a circular saw and a sawzall and an Oscillating Multitool (which I've seen people make cool quick cuts through floors, molding)--the circular saw would make fast work of the job but the overhanging table top would prevent the circular saw from making a long horizontal left to right cut. The circular saw frame can't rest flat on the table top and the apron and is recessed just enough that the circular saw would only cut through about a 1/2"" through the length of the decor piece (which might not be bad --maybe finish the cut with the sawzall and have a guide groove to insure a straight cut?)

I could use the sawzall  for the entire job--though I worry I might get a less straight cut when I do the horizontal (time to buy an industrial aluminum straight edge ruler / level with some chunk.)

Is the sawzall the best way to go?--maybe I'm worrying too much--just need to get it done. It looks like fast work, making two upward cuts and a 3.5 foot horizontal--Done. Most folks that do this daily wouldn't blink an eye.

I've never used the oscillating multitool--which maybe the exact right tool for the job?

I see how the legs assemble and disassemble so i could also just try (we didn't built it) to loosen legs, take that piece of wood out, use circular saw (if the wood comes out with ease)--better outcome.

This doesn't have to be finish work but getting it in then nice zone would be a bonus.

I want to cut out part of the Apron of the table, it's about a 5 inch wide Apron, 1 to 1.25 inch thick. I want to cut out the apron between the left and right legs (leaving  part of the apron close to the legs intact as mounting screws go in there)

I'd say I want to start the cut about 4 inches from the left leg and 4 inches from the right leg, very close to the table top. I'd be cutting a rectangular inset or U shape if I had to.",2,1739556816.0,Tools,3,1.0,False

I'll be coming into ABQ to drop a friend off at the airport, but it'd be too much time for me to take off from work. So I figure I'll just work from a café for the day. Based off of previous posts, I found that people recommend Humble Coffee, Zendo, Little Bear, and Michael Thomas. 

I'll need a space that is open at least 7-4 (that already knocks out Michael Thomas), is cool with someone sitting there all day (I will get breakfast and lunch, and drinks throughout the day), has good wifi, and big enough table tops for a laptop + writing space. Bonus if it's not too loud, but not so quiet that I'll feel terrible if I chat with my friend.

1ipgxbf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ipgxbf,~12$ Big Bialetti boi needs a handle fix,"So, my mum's 6tz pot hooked me into moka pots, then I bought cheap 3tz for myself, and when i wanted to make much more tasty coffee for my family and wanted to buy 12tz i stumbled upon an auction for 18tz ex-display damaged Bialetti and i bid for the lolz...
And now somehow, i'm a proud owner of ~12$ 18tz Moka Express with broken handle.

Now the question is what would be the best method to repair it? 18tz replacement handle can't be bought anywhere. I thought about replacing it with available 12tz handle but it is smaller. Or, i'm overthinking all of this and just go and superglue it like it is now. I could also try to extract the pin, take the broken plastic part and glue it to the handle and reassemble it, but is it worth it? Will the glue hold the weight of fully loaded moka pot glued either way? What's your take on this?",5,1739556724.0,mokapot,8,1.0,False
