As I got to berthing, I noted khakis everywhere, inspecting junior sailors racks and lockers. A chief grabbed me, saying ""C'mon …I got you."" 

I had to ask what a health and comfort was, not having even heard of one before. Turns out they needed to reinspect the property of one of the biggest thieves I'd ever known, and they said they couldn't pick on him specifically, (really!?) so they were inspecting EVERYONE. 

I opened my top rack, and propped up the lid as the chief looked in. And what's the first.fucking.thing he sees? A small plastic baggie full of whitish powder. The chief picks it up gingerly by his fingertips, and lifts an eyebrow quizzically at me...

I facepalmed, as I explained, ""Remember back when we were in the yards, and the ship's coffee mess was closed? If you wanted cream and sugar, you had to bring your own, and that's my creamer. 

Chief looked at me, raises the eyebrow a bit more, and says ""All right, …, I guess I believe you."" He set it down and carried on. Sometimes, it's really great to be known as a hard worker, and a good guy, and not as a shitbag. 

They found all kinds of interesting stuff in that inspection, like the full leather zip kit full of syringes and drugs and such on one sailor, but nothing further was found in my stuff. 

And that's the story of how a baggie of coffee creamer almost got me into hot water during a health and discomfort inspection.",2,1736230104.0,MilitaryStories,1,1.0,False

I've liked him for a long time and since I want to show that, I want to get him something. The thing is that he has money so he has everything. Plus, he owns a lot of things so I am not sure what to get him. I was thinking maybe adopting a penguin in his name since he really does like them (by adopting I mean by donating to help save penguins. It's run through the San Diego Zoo), but I'm worried it might be too much or I'll scare him away. I am planning to write him a short letter, but is adopting too much? I did want to get him these good coffee grounds from Mexico (since he likes coffee) but when I suggested, he didn't want that. He likes penguins, scooby-doo, his fav color is cyan, loves rhythm games, coffee, John Wick films, Wallace and Gromit, old COD, old Need for Speed, and wears a lot of brown clothes. He's also in the military and wants something that will be useful.

1hvkz3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hvkz3t/aitah_for_cutting_contact_with_my_birthmother_and/,AITAH For Cutting Contact With My Birthmother And Pursuing A Bond With My Birthfather Instead?,"I 23F have had a pretty tame life for the most part. Trials, tribulations, obstacles? Sure. But, the way I came to be is much more... dramatic?

23 years ago I was adopted as a 2 week old infant by a single 42 year old mother and her 10 year old daughter. I would also like to add that I am in fact black, and my mother and sister are white ( as well as the rest of my extended family). In reality I was adopted by 2 sets of grandparents, 5 sets of aunts and uncles, and 13 older cousins. I consider them my like my blood. Just because we don't look the same, doesn't mean we love each other any less. If anything, I think they love me even more because of it lol. I had my hardships with race growing up (racism, bullying), but my family has always been there for me whenever I need it most.

My birthmother met my adoptive mother multiple times before I was born. I was not her only child, I was in fact her 5th child at 21. She had 3 children, one child that had passed away before me. She had told the agency that she had met my birth father at a party, and didn't know who he was. So, for 18 years of my life I was totally at peace not knowing who my birth father was.

On my 18th birthday my adoptive mother took me out for some coffee, and casually asked me if I wanted to talk to my birth mother over the phone. Mind you, I had never seen and or spoken to her before in my life. But when she asked me I really felt ready, so I said yes. I spoke to her it was really nice, we even had the same laugh! But then she tells me, that she lied to the adoption agency about her not knowing who my father was. She gave me a first and a last name. She stated that she didn't want him to know where I was and she wanted to protect me from him because he had gone to jail while she was pregnant and that he wasn't a good guy (I was born in a city with a lot of gang, and gun related violence). We talked for a little longer and agreed we wanted to stay in touch. But I was absolutely in SHOCK to say the least.

Fast forward about a year later I've been sitting on this guys name, and curiosity finally killed the cat. I looked him up, but I couldn't find any phone numbers or emails ANYWHERE. But, I found his brother, who then called him to tell him I've been looking for him. And as it turns out... he's been looking for me too.

I found it odd that, out of the 5 children that my birthmother had, that I was the only one that was put up for adoption. I was always told it was for my ""best chance"" at life. Like I said, I love my family, but I always wondered ""Why was it ONLY me that was put up for adoption then?"". Well after listening to my birthfather's side of the story, the picture, slowly started to become more clear. I will say that my birthfather is by no means an innocent man, he's made some pretty dumb mistakes in life, and is currently in prison now for it.

What my birth mother said about him going to jail while being pregnant is true, but my birth father knew he was going to be a dad, and was actually really excited for it. He knew I was going to be a girl (he already had one son) and was over the moon about having one of each. But while he was in jail my birth mother gave birth to me, but told him that I had died in child birth. He was devastated. He asked where he could see my grave site but my birthmother said she didn't know and that the hospital took care of it. She stopped speaking to my dad after that.

A few months go by and my birthmother's sister contacts my birth father and says ""She told you that that baby died, didn't she?"". My birthfather, obviously confused, asked her what she meant by that. My ""birth aunt"" (???) tells my birthfather, that my birth mother put me up for adoption and didn't tell him. She went on to say that my birthmother got back together with one of her other baby daddy's, and he told her he didn't want to take care of another man's baby.

And so, I was put up for adoption, and by the time he found out, I was already home with my family. All he knew what my first name was. The rest of my birthfather's family was devastated as well, they tried to go through the court system to find out where I had gone to how they could fight it. But, none of his information was on my adoption paperwork and all they had was my first name. But he made it very clear that he and his family WANTED me. But him and my birthmother didn't get along (obviously), so that's how everything played out.

AGAIN, I'm in shock. On one hand, it sounds absolutely ridiculous, but on the other...? There was only one way to find out.

I tell my birthmother that I got in contact with my birthfather and that we spoke (we had only spoken a few more times and she didn't reach out again after that for months). She was surprised, but still asked how it went. I simply asked her if she had told my father that I had died at child birth, and all hell broke loose. I had 30 some odd missed calls and text screaming talking in circles about how I can't trust him and how he's a convict and HOW DARE I call HER a liar. I never said she was a liar, I just asked if there was any truth to it. But by the way she went on screaming, texting, calling... I got my answer. I haven't met either parent in person yet (I have a lot of anxiety surrounding the whole thing now), I've only spoken to them over the phone (we all live in different states now).

I've spoken to my birth father more and actually started to get close to him, but he is back in jail and I do miss him. I think I may want to meet his brothers, sisters, and the rest of my birth family. I'm not sure when, but FaceTime is good enough for me for now. I've never had people that look like me before, I never realized how beautiful of a thing that can actually be!

So guys, am I the asshole for wanting to pursue a bond with my birth father and NOT with my birthmother?

1hvkx1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1hvkx1n/my_surprisingly_consistent_austin_stay_hyatt/,My Surprisingly Consistent Austin Stay (Hyatt Regency Austin),"I travel to Austin for work every 4-6 weeks, and while I've tried a few different hotels (Thompson when their rates are good, Tommie when everyone's rates are high), the Hyatt Regency has become my reliable go-to. I checked in today for 4 nights. It might not have the same trendy buzz as The Thompson or Tommie, but honestly, this place delivers where it counts.

* **Upgrades are surprisingly common:** I usually book a standard 2 queen room with my corporate rate, but more often than not, I end up with a king with a view, and this time, even a corner king! All it took was a quick text to the hotel after booking. I've never gotten a suite but don't want or need one on these trips.
* **The welcome amenities are a nice touch:** This time around, I had sparkling water, some local treats, and vouchers for cocktails at the bar AND coffee drinks from their new ""Market"" (which replaced the Starbucks). It's always a pleasant surprise to get these but it is inconsistent... sometimes I get them, sometimes I don't/
* **They still offer the good stuff:** Room service breakfast is still an option (a rarity these days!), and you can choose between 500 points or a $10 food and beverage credit if you decline housekeeping.
* **The staff is genuinely friendly:** From the front desk to the room service folks, everyone is consistently helpful and welcoming. Plus, they're super responsive to texts, which is a huge plus for me.

Hyatt's app is seriously lacking compared to Marriott's. I'd love to see them add mobile chat and request features.  
  
Overall, the Hyatt Regency Austin offers a solid, comfortable stay with some unexpected perks. Highly recommend!

1hvkvnn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hvkvnn,Chapter 4: Screen Shadows,"
The morning had dawned cloudy, promising rain in the afternoon, but inside Cristiano and Georgina's mansion, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. There were only three days left until the trip to the World Cup, and with the weather changing, the poolside day plan was scrapped for a more homely one.

Georgina, dressed in a comfortable, loose dress that inadvertently played with her figure as she moved, decided it would be a good day for a movie marathon. ""JR, do you fancy watching a movie with me? It seems we won't be able to enjoy the sun today,"" she called from the living room, her voice echoing with a friendly invitation.

JR, who had felt his world revolve around Georgina since the day at the pool, accepted with a mix of enthusiasm and trepidation. ""Sure, what do you want to watch?""

""Something light, how about a romantic comedy?"" Georgina suggested, placing popcorn and drinks on the coffee table.  Their closeness, even in mundane tasks, brought a tension to JR that he didn't know how to handle.

They settled on the couch, Georgina right next to him, close enough that her every move sent an electric current through JR. The movie started, but their attention was divided.

""I love this part,"" Georgina said, laughing at a scene where the protagonist was clumsily trying to impress his love interest. ""It's so... hard to be subtle when you want something, don't you think?""

JR, interpreting the comment as a double entendre, felt his heart beat faster, his mind wandering into unexplored territories.

As the movie progressed, Georgina leaned back a little further, her head brushing against JR's shoulder. ""I hope you don't mind, it's more comfortable this way,"" she said, her voice soft and not malicious, but each word resonating in JR like an invitation.

 ""No, it's okay,"" he replied, feeling every brush of her hair against his skin unsettled him. 

In a scene where the main characters were kissing in the rain, Georgina commented, ""I love the rain, it makes everything feel more intimate, don't you think?"" 

JR, his mind elsewhere, heard ""intimate"" and thought of Georgina, of how they would be right now if it hadn't been for the storm, if they were alone in a more private place. 

The rain began to fall hard outside, creating an even cozier atmosphere inside. Georgina stood up to adjust the curtains, and as she did, her dress rose slightly, revealing more than she intended. ""I hate it when everything sticks together because of the humidity,"" she commented, adjusting her dress back, not noticing how JR interpreted her words. 

Returning to the couch, Georgina stretched, her body arching in a way that JR found almost erotic.  ""Ugh, I'm so tired, but I always feel better after a good session of... relaxation,"" she said, and JR couldn't help but think about what kind of ""relaxation"" she might need.

The movie ended, and as they got up to go to the kitchen for more drinks, Georgina tripped on the edge of the carpet, falling towards JR, who held her by the waist. ""Wow, I'm so clumsy, you need to hold me like that more often,"" he joked, laughing, but to JR, each word added fuel to the fire of his forbidden desire.

At the end of the day, with the rain as a backdrop, JR headed to his room, his mind filled with images and phrases from Georgina, each one echoing in his head with a double-meaning echo. In the solitude of his room, as he lay down, he thought about how each moment with her made him want more, how each phrase, though innocent, seemed loaded with promises he didn't dare explore.

 The rain beat against his window, a rhythm that accompanied his thoughts, knowing that in just three days, they would be together in a new country, under Cristiano's proud gaze, but the ghosts of those days at home would continue to haunt him.",2,1736229492.0,Georgina_Rodriguezzz,0,1.0,False

1hvkmsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hvkmsi/my_25nb_new_boyfriend_27m_seems_to_be/,My (25NB) new boyfriend (27M) seems to be manipulating me to end my marriage. Or is my husband (25m) suddenly jealous? ,"TLDR: Got a new boyfriend but he asked me to change almost everything in me to please his parents and now tells me he thinks my marriage days are numbered and my future is with him 

I want to start saying that I'm sorry the post got so long, I tried adding as much details as I felt needed.

Me (25nb) and my husband (25M) met at school and have been together for 5y now (married for 2). For context: we are both polyamorous and have relationships with other people outside our marriage. We call this relationships ""relations"" or ""flings"" depending on the seriousness which i will stick to for clarity sake.

I work in a pretty specific job involving a very popular game. I am also asexual, autistic, transgender (nonbinary) and have a very alternative looking. (all relevant info, i swear).

Around 7 months ago my relation ended and I almost immediately started seeing a friend (27M) with who I had a lot in common (I'll call him Jay in this post).

At first I thought he wanted to cheer me up since i was really sad about the break up. We hangout for 5 or 10 minutes before he tried to kiss me. One thing led to another and we started seeing each other in what I thought was a fling. He was very romantic, he wanted to see me almost everyday, always with giant gestures and showering me with gifts.We kept like this for 4 months until he asked me to be officially his partner on a romantic picnic followed by a romantic concert. At the time, my husband told me he was concerned that it was all going too fast, i took into consideration but went with it anyway.

I talked to him, explained how my marriage works, what i expect in a relation, we talked about boundaries and set that we would be exclusive with each other (except for my husband, of course) and started to date officially.

It started really well and we were hanging out two or more times a week, but soon he asked me to pretend to be cisgender (I don't really pass with my look so I had to change my clothes and hair style a bit) to his parents and not say anything about being married already since they are conservatives and i agreed because i know how difficult it is to explain things like this to family and I thought it was just at the beginning. He also asked me to not post anything related to my husband on my social media since his mom was now following me.

We also started playing the game-I-work-for together but everytime he insisted that i played as different role than the one Im used to (being vague on purpose, sorry).

As I was introduced to his parents I felt something was off, his mom treated me poorly and kept asking a lot of weird questions in an accusative tone such as why did i choose to work in this field, if I make enough money and if my mom didn't mind that I was always at their house (even tho I don't live with her). When I talked to Jay about it he said she was normal and it may just be my autism making me hear things differently.

At the end of November I quit my job due to problems that lead to health issues but kept life the same as I had some money saved. Some days later we were heading to his house and I complained about always going there. He answered me in a rude tone saying I shouldn't want to go out since I was now unemployed and he would have to pay for everything (I never asked him to pay anything). I stayed silent for the rest of the ride and told him I was going home. He cried. A lot. He begged me to stay and started to hyperventilate. I got worried so I said I would stay. He calmed down immediately as if a switch was flipped and we went inside. As soon as we entered his mom asked me if I was going to get a job soon (not even saying hi) and started going off about how I should  get a lawyer to sue them. I was so confused surprised and disturbed that I just kept quiet and nodded to end the conversation.
This was so disturbing to me that as soon as he took a shower and looked better i got my things and went home. Two days later he apologized for crying and for the comment, he brought me flowers, a very special gift and a box full of my favorite chocolates and candies.

During all this time he was very sexual, always initiating things when we were alone (and sometimes even in public) and frequently tried to negotiate boundaries during the act, which I told him made me uncomfortable and under pressure. He also refuses to use protection (it's okay for me but ONLY IF he get checked and show me the test results which he did not) and want me to realize his fantasies and participate in his kinks. As I said, I identify as Asexual but I do have (kink) sex occasionally and he was aware of that from the beginning.

As I saw that he was so ""sexually active"" (idk how to say that? english is not my first language) I tried to add to it so I started to surprise him with sexy clothes and things like that which leads us to the reason of this post.

At the middle of december he invited me to drink at my favorite place (that I showed to him), paid for my favorite drink and such, but he seemed really nervous. After what seems like an hour he said he had something to say. He confessed he was with a girl 15 days after asking me to be his partner. 
I asked why. He said he was just testing, ""trying this poly thing"" were his words. I asked who she was and if i knew her. He said she was no one, just an internet friend that he no longer speaks to. I asked why he waited so long to tell me. He said he felt too guilty.
Then I matched the dates in my head: Just a day before I was meeting him and his friends. I worked really hard on my look that day, choosing a dress that he told me he would love to see me with. I was sexy and provocative, made his friends jealous and initiated sex as soon as we got to his house. I did it all for him. 
When I realized that I told him I was leaving. Threw my drink in the nearest thrash and went home. He didn't went after me (not that I wanted, just pointing out). He kept sending me messages and calling me crying and begging for forgiveness.

A few days later he asked me to see him. I accepted and found him with a giant bouquet of rosed and chocolates. He apologized and begged for a second chance and told me he didn't know we were exclusive, that he misunderstood the situation. That he came clean and would never do it again. I accepted because he looked truly sorry and as an autistic myself I know how it feels to misunderstand something. I just asked him time to get past that. Again it was like a switch was flipped and he was happy again.

Jay started going on and on about the New Year's Eve, about how he was spending it with hid buddies and would like me there. I said I couldn't because I was looking after my brother in law's cats and would spend with my husband and my best friend (24F will call her Lila) who has no one else to be with. He went quiet. He told me it should be my husband's chore to look after his brother's cats and I should be able to ""get out of the house a little"", he asked me to come and bring Lila with me since he had some handsome friends for her (ugh). He was talking a lot about my husband's ""need"" for me at the house and how it seems weird and controlling on his part. I asked him to stop and never talk about my husband again. We fought about it and I went home.

Christmas came and I traveled to be with my family and I ended posting a few pictures of me and my family (one which includes my husband with all the other family members in a big table) forgetting about Jay's mom. New Year's Eve also came and went smoothly as planned.

Five days ago he asked me to go on a date and I declined because I was not feeling well, he called me and asked again if we could go somewhere to talk. He was crying and said his mom saw my pictures and started cursing at him, telling that he was less of a man for accepting such thing and many more things. I accepted seeing him because it looked like an emergency.

He was pretty ok, not even with a sad face, we have some coffee and talked about unrelated things. He dismissed me every time I touched the subject of his mom.

After an hour he finally said his mom was pretty mad and I was no longer accepted in the house. It hit me like a truck. We end up talking about our relationship and i brought up my suspicion that he was not ok with the poly relationship, as he often sounded like he wanted me to end things with my husband. He confessed he though my marriage had the days numbered and would not last long. He said he wanted me to move with him and have kids (both things I was clear I didn't want and would never happen). I asked what if it never happens and he said he didn't want to be with someone with no future.

We talked some more and I decided to end things. I was honest and said I didn't see a ""future"" with him and we should part ways. He cried a lot and begged me not to. He said he saw future in us, that he loves me very much and said so many sweet things and made a lot of promises. I agreed to stay.

When I got home and told my husband, he said Jay was manipulating me and that he can see in my eyes that I am unhappy with him, I called my best friend to talk about and she said my husband must be jealous but jealousy was never a problem for him before (I don't think we would be poly if it was).

I don't know what to do now, because I do agree that listing things like that looks like Jay is being shady but he seems sincere when he talks. Also I don't know if I want a relation where my in laws don't like me and I have to pretend to be someone else.

First shot was poorly dialed in. I did 40 clicks on K6 which worked for silver oak but was too fine for cold brew. Dialed back to 45 and it was good. 16gms in, 36gms out. Had it with 170ml milk.

The flavour profile is noticeably bold and a touch bitter. Definitely has that dense dark chocolate taste. My last coffee was BT birthday blend which had a sweetish tangy taste. I thought that's mild but after having this one, which has absolutely no sweetish flavour, I realize how sweet it was 😄

Cold brew does miss a lingering aftertaste which I yearn for. The quest continues.",5,1736228253.0,IndiaCoffee,4,1.0,False

It pairs nicely with references from film by giving it a similar grain. I enjoy the process of rendering in this manner. 

This was made while drinking coffee and ending my career with alcohol. I would draw for hours to keep my hands from reaching for a drink. It brought me back into a world of art I had neglected for a few years.

The images would take around 4 hours to 8 hours. Throughout multiple sittings. I used to do this to be alone with my thoughts, then it became the thing I did at the bar to avoid drinking and that inevitable cured my loneliness and need to drink. People would come and talk to me as I sat and illustrated. It renewed my will for many things. I hope you enjoy.

The image is not perfect. But this was a few years ago. And, lo, I am soon to start teaching illustration in our new studio. ",2,1736227889.0,drawing,1,1.0,False

I had this friend, let's call her... Kristine. We were best friends through high school except sophomore year as some... stuff went down. After high school, she started seeing this guy, let's just call him ""Gamer Jerk."" (reason will become apparent later.) 

Kristine, GJ and I hung out a few times, with other friends, and got along pretty well. Then January of 2015, Kristine told me that she had been cheating on GJ for about 8 months of their 10 months together... and dumped him on Christmas Eve. And had started getting into using the devil's lettuce. I didn't want to be around that, so I cut her off, and didn't consider us friends anymore. I reached out to GJ to see if he was okay, like a decent human being. A few weeks later we were dating. (Kristine and I were 22, GJ was 23)

Flash forward to 2019, I was 26, GJ was 27. We start having relationship issues, I feel like something sketchy is going on. GJ spends most of his time on his PC playing games instead of spending time with me.  Most of the time, it felt like we were roommates, not a couple. I have periods of low libido, and he would try to guilt trip me into \*giggity\* time, saying ""If you really love me, you'll do this."" (barf)

One of his coworkers, Anna, stayed with us for a month before she moved out of state for a new job. I was fine with this, we got along pretty well and were good friends. I considered us best friends. Then things went downhill. 

Anna left for her new job and GJ and I started fighting a lot. Mostly over Discord, as I shut down in verbal disagreements. We fought over the stupidest stuff. Like one of the things was that I had forgotten to wash a thermos and it got moldy. (I hadn't been diagnosed with my conditions at that point, and everyone just thought I was lazy. I have ADHD and fibromyalgia which makes cognitive function a bit difficult sometimes. I do my best, and I have come to realize, I'm not lazy. I'm disabled.)

GJ took me to Hooters for my birthday dinner. And I had to drive because he didn't. He had his license, but didn't drive unless I planned to drink. The next day we broke up. 

I had to stay with him in the apartment (luckily we had a two bedroom place) for a few months, as I couldn't afford to move out yet. That was awful. I basically survived on coffee. Barely got out of bed to go to work and went straight back to bed. 

GJ was having the time of his life, talking with his online friends and Anna. Anna came to visit in early 2020 (before the pandemic) and they spent all their time together. Like I was just an inconvenience. Not a ""friend"" like he wanted, or like I thought I was with Anna. We went out drinking with some of GJ's coworkers that I had hung out with before. I went home early, as I had had enough of sitting on the sidelines, feeling unimportant. 

I heard when they got home. I heard her heavy breathing like one does in the act of \*giggity\*. So when she had calmed down, I stupidly asked him to come into my room so we could talk. I asked him point blank, ""Did you sleep with her?"" He said no. I didn't believe him. 

Anna went back home, and I just kept feeling like I was being lied to. One day, the curiosity got the better of me. I had the day off, and he was at work. I snuck into his room and went through his things. 

 I found a letter she had written to him, detailing how they had cheated while she stayed with us. (We were still together when she stayed with us.) They worked together, so they carpooled. At the time, I didn't think anything of it, just that I didn't have to make an extra stop. On their car rides together, they'd hold hands in the car. She had also detailed how she liked that he had squeezed her butt in the kitchen while I was ONE ROOM OVER. 

I lost it. I broke every gift I had given him that I could find, burnt her letter and tore up the card that she sent him for Christmas. I had some of my stuff packed up, gearing up to move, so it took me a grand total of three hours to get everything I owned in my car and a U-Haul trailer. 

On my way out, I left EVERY light on, EVERY faucet on hot. He had a bicycle that he would work on sometimes in the yard, and his tools were laying on top of an old hutch I had left because it was a piece of crap. So, I flung them into the grass, making it harder for him to find them. 

Turns out he was gone for the weekend. So every light and faucet was on for at least 96 hours. I left around midday on a Friday. I have no idea when he returned, I was already gone. 

A few months later, I realized I had left some things behind that had sentimental value. GJ agreed to send them to me, and I would send him a check. Shipping was about $25. 

When I got my stuff, I sent him a check. One that he wouldn't be able to cash. I used a feminine version of his name with the animal he got called when he was a child as his last name. And in the memo line, I wrote ""Lying Cheating B\*st\*rd."" 

  
I spent almost 5 years taking care of him. I drove him where he needed to go. I set up his dental appointments. I got him gifts to show affection, I did everything I could to make sure he felt loved and cherished. But joke was on me, he decided that wasn't enough and needed to cheat... After being cheated on **twice**.

1hvkcqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JeremyDewitte/comments/1hvkcqj/jeremy_dewitte_defense_sentencing_memorandum/,Jeremy DeWitte Defense sentencing memorandum. ,"Here is Jeremy's attorneys pre-sentence memorandum at the end of this post. It is not only short but one of the worst written presents memorandums for a defendant I've ever read. In defense of the federal public defender when you have absolutely nothing but shit to work with this is what happens. Booker and FanFan are 2005 cases from the Supreme Court that made the United States sentencing guidelines advisory instead of mandatory. They require the judge to use United States sentencing guidelines section 3553 to calculate the sentence and then give reasons or laws or sentencing guidelines to depart downward or upward. 

First of all the prosecutor is going to investigate the college degree, sick child, and any other factual claim he has made. The IRS special agents assigned to the case will get subpoenas from the district court judge so ordered and have it by the end of the week. But what's most shocking, and I guess the federal public defender has to file something, is that United States sentencing guideline 3553 is going to be used against him by the judge. The judge will go through every section and give specific examples of prior charged conduct or 404B uncharged unconvicted or even undetected bad conduct which includes more than just criminal conduct. He is fucked. And if he lied say about the college degree this judge will upwardly depart and find that he lied under oath. He would do that by putting him on the stand and asking him the question. The federal public defenders pre-sentencing memorandum is not under oath but governed by attorney ethics rules. However if Jeremy said he graduated from college and we don't know if he means a 2-year college for your college or a 1-hour course it AutoZone on motorcycles. Yes the federal public defender should have put the specific college length of attendance graduation and a certificate amended to the memorandum. He probably didn't do so because Jeremy couldn't produce one. 

And the other surprising thing that no one has brought up is that federal magistrate judges are appointed by the district judges who serve for life. Magistrate judges have 10-year terms. They are each assigned to an individual district court judge. Yes it's true that magistrate judges handle most search warrants, most first appearances, even some trials with consent, and take guilty pleas I am somewhat surprised that when the magistrate was elevated to the 11th circuit United States Court of appeals the district judge didn't just grab the case and get the sentencing over with today or tomorrow. It could have been as simple as the district judge being on trial or starting a trial. 

Whatever any of the above influences is yet to be seen. My strong gut experience based on my education training and experience tells me the sentences will be consecutive they will be at least what the US Attorney is asking for 54 months I think and the judge will upwardly depart by 2 years minimum under United States sentencing guidelines section 3553 factors when even one lie or misleading statement occurs. 

Remember, Jeremy has an absolute right not to testify at a sentence in hearing just like at trial. However 99% of federal defendants who enter into a plea agreement testify and it's under oath. Jeremy will not testify. Can the judge outwardly hold that against him, no way. Can the judge inwardly or subconsciously make a reasonable inference that the reason he didn't testify is that he knows he would be caught under oath finally for myriad lies. Remember, at sentencing hearsay is acceptable even double hearsay If material and admissible under the Federal Rules of evidence. 

And another interesting thing that no one caught in the plea agreement is that the United States Attorney agreed to recommend 54 months. He did not agree to cap the sentence of 54 months and if the judge goes higher consent to the plea being withdrawn for no cause needed at all. I may have this wrong because I quickly skim the documents but that is a very very important distinction which shows that the United States Attorneys Office doesn't believe a word out of his mouth and hopes he testifies at the sentence in hearing. That means the recommendation is just that a recommendation that could be changed at any time for a valid offer of proof on behalf of the prosecutors. If it were capped then Jeremy would be smart not testify and roll the dice on what the judge is going to do because there's no way that the prosecutors could get around the cap and most judges have sentencing will honor the cap. 

I'm surprised the prosecutors did not involve the Department of Defense and whatever individual entity within handles stolen valor cases and link them with the United States attorneys office Washington DC DOJ headquarters and the attorneys who handle stolen valor cases and get all the videos together and get those people served judicially signed subpoenas to testify and authenticate the videos. That would have been the final nail in his coffin. Impersonating a police officer is one thing and a bad thing they can get people killed. In my opinion even worse is impersonating that you are a decorated war hero severely injured in combat by a broken parachute and received an honorable discharge. And that you were member of various US military special operations groups. There is not a United States attorney assistant United States Attorney probation officer IRS officer Magistrate Judge or district judge that would not view that as heinous depraved indifference to the Constitution and what it is to be an American, though he can't consider the last part outwardly. 

And to link in customers at least three with videos in his office and have the IRS special agents interview them to see if their decision was based at all on the military paraphernalia and/or Jeremy's own statements about being in the military or the police. This is prosecution 101. I think that most of us while rightfully so you Jeremy as a true menace to society. But federal prosecutors do have cases that have to be prioritized in front of this especially Cyber terrorism, the drug trade internationally etc. But I can tell you unequivocally from clients It is much different when two men in blue suits wearing American flag pins and who look like buster Brown knock at your door at 6:00 a.m. and identify themselves as IRS special agents and who inform the witnesses that lying to a federal agent is a 5-year prison sentence where line to local county or state police is not illegal. Most people after they have shit themselves and went and got their depends will spill the beans faster than the guy in the Colombian coffee commercials. This for reasons we may or may never know was not done. I think they know it's going to be consecutive and I think that they know he will fuck up in prison and forfeit his good time both in state and federal and spend 10 to 12 years of actual jail time. For them and the fact that no one was seriously injured or died makes it enough of a sentence.

And to answer the question in the other thread because I'm too tired regarding jail credit in local county federal state cases in which multiple levels of government are involved he gets credit for any time he was in any jail cell for 24-hour period. So it means that in every single case whether it be Windermere or federal Court he gets credit for time served. Sometimes it confusing where to place that credit but that is a discussion for another thread. 

I'm just glad this punk is getting punked by the legal system and will soon learn what it is like to be punked out in prison. And just like we have access to Pacer gang shot callers have access to Pacer through friends and family. They'll ask him to produce his paperwork and sometimes the feds will even give him fake paperwork showing a drug charge so they don't have to deal with all the attacks and sex offender bullshit from other inmates. But the gang shot callers will find out quickly he forcibly raped a child 12 years or under and it's game over. They will come to his cell and tell him he has one hour to report to the guard shack or the guard on duty if the yard is shut and check into segregated housing stating his life is in danger. And if he discloses why the gang shot callers have tentacles in every county state or federal prison. There is no way for him to survive disclosing who made him check in as they say. 

That could be looked at as the true justice in this case. The Federal Bureau of prisons and the state of Florida Department of corrections have their hands full because between Jeremy spewing bullshit to other inmates about why he's in there and then they find out the truth and the whole transfer process has to happen and with the feds it's on Conair typically to another side of the country because I suspect it will be almost in every 6 month transfer in any prison. He cannot stay in segregated housing unless he has committed some egregious prison violation and even then with recent court cases not over a year without special approval from DOJ Washington. He can't stay in segregated housing claiming to be schizophrenic because a psychiatrist will give him the MMPI and determine he is a malinger, psychopath with pathological liar and intermittent explosive anger disorders but nothing to keep him in segregated housing under a psych designation. 

Jeremy's going to have to learn what it's like to piss at 33,000 ft in turbulence shackled at his legs and hands and donuts to dollars the wardens will put a special instruction and to put a black box over the handcuffs which is even more uncomfortable and usually reserved for people who tried to escape or high value inmates and with the United States Marshall holding your orange jumpsuit. And to have to go through that the entire prison sentence or if it's the state on buses or small transport planes is going to cut to the very heart of Jeremy that is total and complete and permanent loss of control which in and of itself in my humble opinion is worse than any prison sentence he could receive.

They're a huge Coffee & Whiskey fan. Last year during the Spring Semi Annual Sale. They had the ""Paris Cafe"" wallflowers. I bought at least 7. I know it's coming back as a candle in the ""Spring"" collection. But is it coming back as a wallflower also? Has it always come back as a candle & Wallflower? I remember seeing it as a candle for the past few years. But I'm not sure about the wallflower. I wish I grabbed more, ugh.

  
Now the Mahogany Apple. The store I shopped at, during the last wallflower sale around Thanksgiving, I think? I only grabbed a few because I wasn't too sure if others would like it as gifts. (I must have good taste because every scent I gifted someone. They loved it) 

The store had at least 20 of those Mahogany Apple wallflowers, the next day I'm going to assume with the rest of the fall stuff. It was put back for the annual sale going on now. (I'm hoping during the last week of the sale, that will be when the clearance wallflowers will be $1.99) 

If I don't find anymore. I can't remember how it smells. I have some still new & I'm not opening it because they're gifts for Christmas 2025. 

Does Mahogany Apple & Honeycrisp Apple come back as a wallflower every year? I know Mahogany Coconut, Mahogany Vanilla, Mahogany Teakwood, always comes & goes.

I recently smelt the country apple wallflower scent & it kinda smells like HoneyCrisp Apple. But that Honeycrisp apple is really good !!!.

Don't get me started on that ""Cranberry Orange Seltzer"" Lord, I love that scent. Reminded me of mixing Fanta orange soda with cranberry ginger ale. 

I need to learn to start buying at least 5 of a ""Scent"" that I know it's either seasonal or it's going to sale out. That coco paradise wallflower sold out QUICK the other day at my store lol

  
I really hope Paris Cafe, Honeycrisp Apple, Mahogany Apple will return as a wallflower one day this year.

Experience -sure?
Size - minor importance
Normal drinks - homemade cold brew (black), med-dark roasts with cream
Bought a df54 grinder (awesome) and delonghi ecp3420, but the machine is so-so. I don't love the wet pucks, semi inconsistent shots, and the 51mm is a little small (with my not do big bottomless portafilter that I'd also return). I don't really care about the steam wand capabilities in a machine. I'm new to home espresso, I've rotated through French press, pour overs, etc. Former sbux barista, so the machines did 99.8% of the adjustments for me.

I'd like something similar to the gaggia classic, but it's at the top of my budget.

I like to tinker, but that wouldn't be something I'd like to do in the next 6-12 months, and I'm not too fussy about my beans. Having a machine that's very consistent would be ideal, similar results when using the same gring/dose/time would be amazing. Future upgrades and servicability would be nice.

A friend will part with their fairly new breville barista express for $200, which seems like a steal  (they aren't local to try the coffee/machine myself). As an exception to tinkering, I'd modify the grinder sooner than later if the results made a big difference. I'd also be happy using the df54 with this.

The gaggia fits my general interest to modify things, has commercial style build, and seems to be built to last. Maybe there's another machine to consider?

Thanks in advance!

I begin to get angry like it invalidates my progress and I was misled. 

Suddenly friend comes back says he clarified with his wife and it's technically not unethical but what she should have done was said she can't take me on but will recommend somebody... 

So it's not unethical but she shouldn't have done it? 

I have therapy agian in 11 hours and this has been racing thoughts for 2 days now and it's all I wanna bring up in therapy but I'm worried I'll hurt my Ts feelings or make her feel bad.

[ La Spaziale S1 MV2, DF83Variable ]","For some time now maybe 2 years after getting this hardly used machine, I have been pulling 9bar shots, and once I changed grinders I have been loving the cups from this 53mm beast.

Recently in the past 2 weeks, I noticed something off, and was paying attention to the machine work, and **I see the gauge pegged at 15bar**, then the lowest it goes is about 14. This has a 5 or so second pre-infusion, so normally it hits around 9barrs after that.

Now it does the pre-infusion at the same normal amount, but then ramps up to 15bars.  
After back to back tries, 1 of the, maybe 5 or 7 shots actually hit and stayed at 9bar (same beans, same grind in testing). Then the next few hit max again.

So.... I thought the OPV valve seat might be worn, and ordered it from Clive, and since his shipping is so high, I ordered a tube so I could feel better about it.. I replaced the OPV seat, and put everything back....BAM, I still hit max bars. I adjusted to lower it further this time, and it got to 13-14bar, and that's the MIN, as I unscrewed a touch more and it comes apart.

I dont think I have descaled the machine, as I have been using mostly evaporated water, and I use a coffee sack as well. Maybe that introduces scale? But then I would think the pressure would be lower when clogging.

Water flow without the PF LOOKS OK. I have not measured it, and not really sure what to measure for. I have read something like 250mL in 20 seconds/ ?

1hvjszh,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hvjszh/my_saudia_long_haul_experience_best_economy_class/,My Saudia Long Haul Experience: Best Economy Class Ever  ,"I took four long haul flights on Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) between US and S.E Asia in addition to a Umrah stopover.

Booking: easy enough to book a multi-city trip, but the website was a bit clunky for sure. Advance seat selection was not free on my basic economy ticket and 2 free checked bags were included. I did not need to do a credit card verification at the airport.

Pre-Departure: Except for the SIN - JED segment, there was a charge to choose your seat during online check-in, which was bizarre, but it was easily sorted out at the airport. Every staff member I interacted with was so easy to talk to and polite, regardless if they were Saudia employees or third party contractors. I was able to request a window seat of my choice and the agent did tell me they always block off a chunk of seats until airport check-in, so they can seat families together at the airport.

Economy Class Seats; I was on the 777-300ER and had to double check if my seat was economy plus, the legroom was AMAZING.  Saudia advertises their long haul configured 777-300 with a seat pitch of 34 inches and a layout of 3-3-3. That coupled with the generous recline and breathable leather upholstery made the seat very comfortable. Even with the generous cradle recline, it was easy to work on the laptop. The 787 was also a comfortable aircraft but I could definitely feel the narrower seat pitch and width. Still better than the 787 seats on most North American airlines and I saw people working easily on their laptop as well. For comparison, Saudia has a 32 inch seat pitch while United has 31 inches in their 787 seats.

Service: every single crew member I interacted with was so polite and hospitality oriented, with crew asking time to time if we enjoyed our meal and if we needed anything else, they were always happy to oblige. Right after departure, the crew provide a fragrant hot towel service, amenity kits, bottle of water, earphones, followed by Saudi date fruit 'sukkari' paired with Saudi coffee 'kahwa' in traditional style cups. The flight between Saudi Arabia and S.E. Asia included a hot meal service followed by a hot snack pre-arrrival meal. Flights to/from the US were longer so we had 4 services: a hot meal, a light snack with drinks, a hot mid-flight snack, and a hot pre-arrival meal. 

Amenities: on each long haul flight, we were provided a amenity kit that included a high quality plush eye mask, ear plugs, dental kit, and slip resistant socks. A soft green blanket and pillow was provided as well. The crew were happy to provide additional amenity kits and blankets on request. There is a Musallah (Muslim prayer area) onboard as well. I also found the built in bidet in the lavatory to be a nice touch but it was only on the long haul configured 777-300ER aircraft. Lavatories also had eu de toilette and sanitizer along with soap. 

Catering: I enjoyed my meals on all my flights apart from the on my SIN - JED segment, the main meal a fish curry paired with okra stew and rice. The catering by SATS catering from Singapore to be kindof mediocre. However the crew gave me another dish, the pasta dish, which was very tasty and an improvement. The catering on flights departing out of Saudi Arabia were definitely better, with a delicious dessert, refreshing starter, warm bread, butter, and a choice of entree, For on demand snacks, there was potato chips/crisps, date muffins, chocolate chip cake, and granola bars. (Ofcourse this can vary by route)  On one of my flights, a Hindu passenger did not request a vegetarian meal and the only choices were meat or chicken, so the crew arranged a vegetarian medley for him from business class. I also appreciated that unlike most airlines not from East Asia, Saudia does offer green tea, which I find to be uncommon from that region where black tea and coffee is more popular. As it is a dry airline, alcohol is not served at all on Saudia flights.

Entertainment: I personally am not into watching TV all that much so I just enjoyed the IFE map and read my book. The earphones they provided were really low quality though, but that is common across most earphones provided in economy class, even on airlines like Turkish and Singapore Airlines. I did have an issue where the IFE screen was not working on one of my flights, so the crew offered a different seat, but I only cared about the map so I stayed put. Saudia did wound up sending me a 200 SAR voucher to use towards a future flight as a compensation.

Transit: definitely easier compared to mega-hubs like IST. There is also a mass transit train within the airside so the walk times were pretty short. It seems every other gate had a bathroom wedged between it so that was convenient. I also liked the waiting area seats, they had high backrests with a curved edge making it easy to to rest my head on it and doze off for a bit. My only two complaints were the lack of a rest area in the terminal and the phone number verification to use the WiFi. However, the cashier at a Starbucks coffee was kind enough to let me connect to their WiFi. The ground staff were also polite and professional as well. Shout out to the gate agent for one of my flights, I was told my row was empty on my flight, and they even happily showed me the seat map on the screen.

Punctuality: Saudia was ranked among the top air carriers for on time performance, and it shows. My flights were all done timely and seamlessly. My bags all made it without issue.

The Little Touches: Economy class leaves little room for differentiation on most full service airlines. However, Saudia really went all in to make the experience better. The hot towel service, warm bread served with the meals, stylized cups for the coffee / kahwa, incredible legroom, uniquely designed amenity kits, and the plush eye mask. They really are keen to offer a great passenger experience. Above all, the service from everyone I interacted with made this experience a very positive one.

I have flown other airlines like Qatar, Air China, Emirates, Turkish, Qantas, United, and many more on ultra long haul trips, I truly enjoyed Saudia and hope to use them again for my future travels.",8,1736225624.0,travel,3,0.83,False

What does your morning routine look like? What was helpful in establishing a morning routine? What keeps you consistent?

I’ve always had a hard time with waking up and taking xyrem helped with that immensely for years. I changed jobs about 2 years ago and work from home full time now. I had been working from home pretty consistently since the pandemic started. Mornings have been really tough for me since my job change especially. I’m single and live alone with my dog. She loves to snooze in the morning so she isn’t much help. 🤪 One year ago I began having constant migraines and needed to be on medications that made me horribly tired. I finally weaned off the medication that was the worst for fatigue and am trying to establish better routines now that I’m not quite so foggy all the time. It’s been challenging. I wake up a few minutes before I need to be at my desk for work and don’t give myself any extra time. I know I feel better with a morning routine - eating breakfast, time to get myself ready (a struggle since I don’t have to “be” anywhere besides my computer…), playing with my dog, tidying up, etc. I know all of those things help me to have a better day and, at the same time, it’s so hard to choose that instead of sleeping longer. 

What’s helped y’all have successful mornings? (And please don’t say coffee!! My neurologist and I decided that it was best for me to cut caffeine out entirely because of my migraines.)",1,1736225398.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

1hvjo0d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hvjo0d,Onkyo SBX-300 Speaker Dock: mini review,"TD;DR  - while more than worth what i paid, there are some problems and it’s not my fave. 

2025 has started as a good year for me finding cool stuff for cheap. Today I picked up this speaker dock for $5can ($3.50us). It is in great shape and still has the remote which is important to me. While it was a great deal, it is the least fave of my speaker docks which are in order of preference:
1. Apple HiFi
2. Bose SoundDock Portable
3. Sony RDX-30ip
4. Onkyo SBX-300

Pros:It is nicely built, looks pretty good and seems to have fairly good build quality (eg it seems sturdily built and weighs almost as much as my Apple Hifi). While it is not a ""portable"" (ie is has no battery options) it has a built-in carry handle. The remote is full-featured (perhaps to the point of too many buttons). My Sony is the only other unit that has a remote that lets you fully navigate the ipod menu. That is important to me as often I am using these speakers in places where my hands are dirty and it would rather use the remove than mess with the speaker or the ipod. Like the Sony, the remote is easy to clean off if it gets dirty. 

Cons:It is not compatible with a lot of my iPods. It does not work with my Minis, my 1st Gen nano, my Classic 6th gen 160 (to thick), and the 5th gens only semi work (they display the ""OK to Disconnect"" screen when plugged in. The music can play but seeing where you are navigating is problematic. The manual says it can only work with these ipods: iPod touch (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation), iPod classic, iPod nano (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th generation). This is a bit of a drag as my daily driver these days is often one of my minis. 

It is too bass heavy. Like a lot of speakers and stereos from that era, it tries to pack in as much bass as possible at the expense of mid tones. Its offical name is ""Onkyo iOnly Bass"", so it tries to make sure you know that it can do bass! It also comes with 2 levels of ""Super Bass Sound Effects"" (that is actually what they are called in the manual) - and I think it sounds better with neither of these on. TBF my Sony RDX-30ip does a similar trick and also sounds better with them turned off. Even with the bass effects off tho, I find the Onkyo sounds a bit murky and the least fave sounding of the 4 speakers that i have.

Conclusion: 
Given it was the price of what a cup of coffee can cost, I am certainly glad I bought it. I have never had any Onkyo products before but I always perceived that they were pretty good quality products. So I was a tiny bit disappointed as I expected I would have thought it work be towards the top of the ranking of my docks. Again, it is not garbage but I thought may be more. 

I am also disappointed that most of the iPods I have do not work with it. I was planning of this dock being used in the garage and on the patio in the summer and in those circumstances I would rather use one of my “beater” iPods, not my immaculate 7th Gen (which is currently plugged into it). 

Again, I am NOT complaining about it, given the price I paid!! I just wanted to share my views if you come across one that costs more than a nice cup of coffee! ;-)

1hvjjp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1hvjjp1/viviankaran_equation/,Vivian-Karan equation ,"I think Vivian is one of those introvert guys who get stuck on specific people and relationships. From a game point of view, it's evident that Vivian would've been more visible if he continued having coffee fights with Chahat, or had rivalries with Chum, Rajat, Avinash. But instead the guy is stuck on why Karan doesn't consider him as a friend and why Shilpa said that 50-50 days things. I think, as a person, Vivian is someone for whom even a very small ordinary gesture is very big in his mind. That's why him wishing Karan every year on his birthday has bigger significance for him, and Shilpa choosing him over Karan in Rajmata task made a bigger impression on him. One thing I've observed Vivian isn't that affected when younger people like Chum, Digvijay attack him, or Avinash or Eisha betray him. But he always seeks validation from Karanveer. 

.

I guess, he sort of seeks Karanveer as an elder brother figure like he's for Avinash and he's sort of attracted to people who are more socially adept than him and who sort of can sort of protect him which he finds it difficult to have as he's already considered dominating and arrogant thanks to his voice and physique. Vivian's anger with Shilpa also stems from the fact that he feels she came between him and Karan, but at the same time only time he genuinely feels happy is with Karan and Shilpa.

.


Karanveer, I feel, is a very socially smart and charming guy and it perfectly makes sense why a guy like Vivian seeks his validation. But Karan is also shrewd so from a game point of view, he was counting for his rivalry with Karan and hence didn't want to encourage that Main Tera Dost Hoon narrative. But apart from game, he does have a soft corner for Vivian. Even when he was fighting with Chahat, his line was Main Vivian nahi hoon na hi Avinash hoon jo tera sab sahan kar loonga. And I feel, even he kind of looks out for Vivian as he remembers who wronged him and all that which Vivian doesn't remember that much. But from game's perspective, he tries to focus more on rivalry angle. 

.

As for Avinash, he was against Avinash all the time, but Kashish and Chahat's mom fiasco kind of hit a nerve and made him more sympathetic towards Avinash as he knows in public perception, it's very easy to label a man as something even after the whole thing was not started by the man and he is villified for ever. Avinash, is ruthlessly ambitious guy, who'd backstab anyone for trophy but the whole fiasco was uncalled for. In fact, Vivian raised the right point that it was in fact Sara, who brought the whole thing in a problematic way. Karan's perspective is understandable as he doesn't trust Avinash a bit, but in principle, he's kind of fed up of men being always perceived as villains so particularly in these scenarios, he comes out as over protective towards Avinash. (which even Vivian is not as he maybe hasn't seen those side of things which Karan may have experienced.)

.

I wish to see Vivian and Karan as finalists as they are kind of firm on their stances though maybe they seem as utterly stupid, fool, spineless from outside, but at least they don't make relationships only with game perspective. Vivian could have fought tooth and nails with Chum when she was very rude with him for two weeks but he sort of let it go because he likes Chum maybe as a person and don't want to attack her. Matlab theek hai, usko kisi se nahi ladnaa to nahi ladnaa. With Karan and Shilpa, he fights as I feel he looks up to them maybe due to belonging to similar age group. And even though the age difference between 36 and 28 (him and Avinash) is not that big, he is kind of stuck in ITV hero's Bada Bhai character where big brother must give and give and not expect anything from younger brother. And he expects the same from KV. But being not much articulate, he can't even tell that to KV

.

From Chahat, he was expecting some sort of camaraderie because he tries to bring that ""Hamaare MP me...and Pandey ko bhi pata hoga"" conversation often but again, Chahat was also more interested in rivalry angle so Vivian was sort of stuck as he was trying to create a Rajshri Suraj Badjatya movie in Big Boss which counted on him being an Anurag Kashyap protagonist due to his image. Avinash understood the assignment from beginning, hence he was awarded. Karan understood it after 6 weeks, hence the behaviour of Bigg Boss towards him. Vivian is still not understanding. He understands it now but doesn't want to fake it for a game. Shrutika and Chum were all in attacking mode towards Vivian since weeks, so suddenly their care and concern is baffling for them. It'd be different if Karan would have said it. Even when Shilpa was asking for some time from Vivian and Karan mockingly asked ki mujhe date milegi Vivian se, Vivian told him ki main tujhe date kya poora haftaa doonga if you talk with me clearly. It feels he is as if waiting for Karan to accept him, but he feels frustrated when Karan doesn't reciprocate.

.

And what's with this Buddha-Buddhi talk? Karan is 41-42, Vivian is 36, Shilpa is in her 50s. But why to age shame them? It's not as if they are acting like kids? And it's not their mistake that they are old-hags (as some ppl like to call them) and still most major Muddas revolve around them without usual Ladka-Ladki, love angles. So called young lot will also grow old one day and tbh, Vivian, Karan and Shilpa had more aura and charisma on screen in their young days without even social media and PR",29,1736224744.0,biggboss,8,0.97,False

The slow evenings and embraces under the summer night sky 🌌. The moon and the stars felt like they were lit just for us and our dreamlike trysts. It felt so safe and dreamy in your presence, in your arms. I don’t think I ever felt so safe with someone I barely knew. But something told me I knew you before, maybe in a past life, if that’s something you believe in. I loved that you were a father. I loved your love for your sweet kiddos. That was (is) my favorite thing about you. The father you are and have always been. God I wish you knew how much I loved this.

I was so broken then. I don’t even remember how much I shared with you. That I was still recovering from an abusive relationship. That I opened myself up to a love that cut me up inside and left. I definitely didn’t tell you that I hated myself, that I felt so unlovable, that I needed attention and physical affection to feel okay about myself. But I think you knew just from the way I didn’t ask you too many questions, and didn’t say much. 

I think a lot about the way we’d just gaze into each others eyes then fall into the best kisses I’ve ever experienced. These are the moments I wish I could put in a bottle and relive over and over again. 

You were going through separation from your ex too. It felt like fate brought us together. Both of us going through what we were. And I felt so seen by a very distant God or universe or some higher power (such a rough time that I don’t even remember what I believed in to be completely honest). You held a little bit of me, and I held a little bit of you. We made love as companions, friends, both broken from previous love that was too deep. Too deep to be ready to encounter another love that was potentially as deep. 

I romanticize you and all the small moments we shared. Like when you made me coffee (the best kind). I never take sugar in my coffee but I’d take it exactly the way you make it with sugar every day if it meant reliving those moments with you. We never even went out on an actual traditional “date”. We loved each other the way we both needed. That’s how I know it was a real deep love. 

I cut you off for a while. I wanted more. I didn’t know if you loved me the way I loved you. I was afraid of being heartbroken again. Being cut up and throw away. So I cut you off before you could do any of that to me. I don’t know if that was a mistake. In the moment it was what I needed to protect my heart and my soul from any more pain. I wish you knew how much pain I was in. That I couldn’t bear any more pain. Maybe then you would have been more forthcoming. Or maybe not. I don’t know. 

I’m glad we talked and reconnected recently. I hadn’t thought about you for a while. But I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you ever since. It doesn’t seem like anything is going to happen between us now. I’m not the same person I was (for the better). Even if we never speak or see each other again, I want you to know you were my favorite lover, friend, and scrabble partner. 🕊️ ",5,1736224734.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,0.86,False

The first thing I did when I finished reading the translation was gulp down an entire litre of water. My throat had become parched due to my mouth hanging agape the entire time.

What I had just read shared more in common to the Historical Fiction stories I had written, rather than History. Minus the supernatural element of course. That was by far the most unsettling bit about it, and I couldn’t stop the automatic questions that began to spawn in my head as a result.

*What if inside WAS haunted by spirits?*

*What if Herod WAS buried within?*

*What if all that Salome had witnessed WAS in fact the TRUTH?*

History is filled with references to the supernatural; spells, curses, prayers and incantations that could be found in many different places, tombs being the most common. Crypts of Egyptian Pharaohs have been unearthed, graves and catacombs across Europe scraped clean of treasures specifically given to the dead. Yet, in all of these situations, any references to curses upon the living are never taken seriously. And why should they? Thousands of tombs have been raided and none have ever recorded being haunted after. It was all just the plain old superstitions of a far less educated people from a different time period.

But, the inscription within the *Hamsa* hands on the wall, seemed different. I felt it with every educated strand in my mind.

No one had ever put in as much effort as Salome had to conceal a supposedly dangerous place. If the elaborate patterns and extremely long text on the wall were not a job enough to conduct, then the construction of this secondary seal and the subsequent burial of it all that she mentioned at the end of her text gave enough indication that her intentions went far beyond the cliche of her time.

In my analytical mind, I knew it was just an extremely elaborate example of the fear of the supernatural that was common in ancient times. But the nauseating feeling in my guts, and the throbbing in my chest were only present because I was not wholly content. Something was off about this place.

I slept very little that night, my mind constantly recounting pivotal moments within the text that just so happened to be the most chilling. After all the research I had conducted on Salome, not once was there ever a mention of her connection to key biblical events, and particularly to Heralds of God. She was just a Herodian princess tied to the intrigues of Herod’s court. By the time sleep did come, I was under the conclusion that the inscription had not been translated properly. It was the only logical explanation.

When morning came, I was very eager to meet with Naeem and Mia and hear their opinions of it. It was just before sunrise when I knocked on the door of Naeem’s accommodation.

“This better not be some sick joke,” I said as soon as he answered.

His eyes darted about as he scanned the base behind me for anyone who might have followed me. He jerked his head in a gesture for me to enter, and stood by the door as I brushed past him. He threw the door shut, but withdrew at the last moment to ensure a smooth and gentle latching.

He turned to me, his eyes a mix of hope and eagerness. “You’ve read it all?”

I scoffed. “Nah, I just went to sleep without reading the very text at the centre of the lie that brought me to this place. Now you be transparent with me, Naeem. This is no joke?”

Naeem’s eyes widened and he shook his head vigorously. “Denial is a dangerous emotion when it comes to confronting that which is out of the ordinary. Please, Corey, you know I didn’t drag you here to the West Bank whilst my grandchildren were held hostage just to play some elaborate prank on your educated ego. What you read has been translated almost word for word. The only parts I may have added in were some definite articles for grammar’s sake, but that’s it!”

I sighed, rubbing my poorly rested face with my hand as I collapsed onto a recliner lounge that was beckoning me. “I’m sorry, Naeem. I believe you. It’s just so difficult to comprehend.”

Naeem flicked on the kettle and sat beside me as it began to boil. “Trust me, I had the same reaction as yourself. Mia too. Just be thankful you got to read it all in one sitting. We had to read it at the agonizing pace of the excavation. We would reach a certain point and be desperate to know what happened next but had to wait another week or two until the layer of text below was unearthed.”

“Do you believe it is true?” I asked.

Naeem hesitated for a moment. “Well, I hope not, considering the reasoning behind it all. But you’re the Salome expert, so I was hoping to hear your perspective on such a recount being consistent with her character. Thats the first step before we can go any further with this.”

The kettle reached its boil and as Naeem poured me a cup of coffee, I told him that I did believe it was Salome who had written it. It had been a rather personal retelling of her experiences, nothing like all the source material available that I used for my paper on her. There were references to several historical events, and being told through her POV, I supposed that they did line up as close to what she would have likely experienced.

“What worries me more,” I continued, as Naeem handed me the warm mug of coffee, “is the historical events that are mentioned are quite inconsistent with what has already been recorded.”

Naeem shrugged as he sipped from his cup. “She makes a point of mentioning Nicholas of Damascus, the court historian. He was present for many of that which he recorded, but what if he was only able to record certain events purely out of reliance of someone else’s word for it? Take Antipater’s death for instance. Josephus and Nicholas have recorded him being taken to Caesarea and imprisoned for some time before being executed. What if, Salome’s account is the truth and this was merely the fabrication she told the court when she arrived after witnessing the grizzly end of the prince. We have no other sources to go off, so I’d give that a fair chance.”

I shuddered as I recalled the imagery of Antipater being turned into a bloody dough. It prompted the barrage of questions of the true troubling aspects of the text to come forth.

“Alright, forget historical authenticity. Let’s talk about the…supernatural…things,” I said.

Naeem gulped. “Straight to the crunch then. Good. Well, it sure gives me goosebumps to think that King Herod may very much still be alive, albeit in a tormented state, right beneath our feet.”

“There’s that. But what about this whole bitterness of the Spirits of the children of Bethlehem within? So dangerous they are that a Herald of God was forced to intervene and order the very erection of the wall?”

Naeem nodded. “It definitely doesn’t make me want to go further with the project, wouldn’t you agree?”

I did.

As I said, despite many ancient tombs having some eerie warnings or curses upon them, the effort that went into keeping this place closed off really made me uncomfortable. I believed it was well to respect Salome’s wishes and leave the place alone.

Mia entered, and after catching up to where me and Naeem were at, she sat next to me on the recliner, close enough that our thighs were touching. I felt a moments distraction from the topic of conversation.

“In the end, it is only the three of us here who know that there is actually more to this site than the monolith which has already been uncovered,” Naeem said. “All we have to do, is misinform Suffian that the monolith is nothing more than an inscription detailing the life of Salome. We can use your expertise, Corey, on her character, to fabricate such a text.”

I chuckled bitterly, even though I was sort of in agreement with Naeem. “So here is the crux of me being here then. You are too afraid to enter the tomb, so wish to alter the truth of the text to give Suffian no need to go further. You needed an expert on Salome who can write up the most accurate one imaginable.”

Naeem was silent as he chewed on his gums.

Mia placed a tender hand on my arm and gave me a reassuring smile. “I’ve tried telling him it won’t work. Suffian is a tyrant when it comes to getting this place unearthed, and I fear that his measures will become even more drastic when he learns that the place is not the tomb of Herod that he thought it was.”

Naeem stood up with an exasperated look on his face. “Mia, Salome has made her warning clear enough, and it is up to us to decide if it should be respected or ignored.” He ran a finger along the edge of a steel ring planted on his index finger. It had an Islamic verse written upon it. “I may be an academic, but I am a devout Muslim, which makes me understand one thing. If Allah Wills this place to be sealed, then it is my duty to make sure it remain so.”

I couldn’t argue against that. I was no Muslim, and definitely not the devout Catholic that my parents would have wanted. But in the end, if, just IF, Salome was telling the truth of there being bitter spirits within the tomb, I would much prefer to leave it alone.

And so, for the next three days as we awaited Suffian’s return, I worked closely with Naeem and Mia, editing the translation to such an extreme that by the time we reached the finished product the only original part was the scene of Salome helping Joseph escape Bethlehem with the help of her lover, David. The rest was, in the end, a very well researched biography told in the first person.

My nervous anticipation of confronting Suffian for the first time was temporarily put at ease by my evening flings in Mia’s apartment. When we weren’t working on our presentation for Suffian - a rarity - we fucked. I’ve had many flings with women over the years, but the sex with Mia definitely came with a measure of passion. When we had finished, we would lie in each other’s arms, and, despite the more demanding tasks at hand, talked about our lives. The sex was amazing, but it was these conversations that I looked forward to the most. With the few opportunities we had, I managed to learn so much about her. I knew I was falling in love with this girl of simple origins who had defied her family’s expectations to become the educated woman she was today. Her love was vigorously returned.

When Suffian arrived at the site, he did so with all the pomp that I had been expecting. The entire team stationed at the site, from labourers, Archaeologists, us three Historians, cooks, machinery maintenance crew, and security personnel, lined the cleared section of the plateau that served as the carpark, as a convoy of military grade vehicles pooled into the site. Dust filled the air and choked our lungs as we stood there as though we were waiting for the Queen. All up, twenty vehicles had entered. Hamza stepped out from the tenth vehicle, a cigarette jutting from his mouth and making no effort in concealing the two pistols holstered beneath his bullet proof vest. He made his way to the passenger door and opened it.

Out came a tall man wearing a plain blue button up shirt. His full head of thick white hair was cropped short, a stark comparison to his dark bushy eyebrows and moustache. His face seemed inclined to a perpetual scowl. He gave me the instant impression of someone who always got his way and would refuse to compromise for anything. He had the look of one not unused to ordering death.

He scanned the gathered people and when his eyes fell upon Naeem’s - a gesture that made the professor quake - he approached us, Hamza and his security team following close behind.

“Suffian, it is good to see you,” Naeem said in a supplicating tone. He looked exactly like how I imagined a slave addressing their master in ancient times.

Without even an acknowledgment of the greeting, Suffian bore his hard gaze onto me. “You are the scholar from Italy?” he asked in heavily accented English.

“Yes.”

For what felt like an eternity, I was imprisoned by his scowling face as his eyes seemed to reach into my very soul to analyse my character. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he pulled out a knife and began to saw at my throat.

“Good. Tell me what is written on that wall,” Suffian said, straight to the point.

Naeem shuffled forward. “Suffian, come to my accommodation, it’ll be easier to discuss it-“

“You’ve had enough time. I want answers. Now!” Suffian spat. Hamza rested his hand upon the holster of his gun, adding further emphasis to Suffian’s demand.

Suffian’s eyes continued to bear down on me as I struggled to find the words as to how I was going to address the situation. I was for the life of me not expecting to be thrown straight into the deep end like this. Logic had compelled me to believe that after greeting us, Suffian would have retired with the three of us to the comfort and quiet of one of the accommodations. There we could have had him read our fabricated translation before addressing him as we had already rehearsed. This had just thrown all planning right out the window. We didn’t even have the fabricated translation on us to refer to.

In that moment I was about to give in. I was about to tell the lie we had agreed on. Threat from this demanding politician or not, I was not going to allow him to violate Salome’s warning and unleash a potential evil upon the Earth.

But just as I was about to speak, Mia stepped forward.

“There’s more to the site! What has been uncovered is only a secondary seal for the true seal of the tomb. You can go further!”

Both me and Naeem glared at Mia with wide eyes. I was horrified that she would tell the truth so easily. All the last days hard work of fabricating the story to conceal the truth had been for nothing.

Suffian’s eyebrows raised in response to the remark, but he kept his gaze locked on me.  “Do not speak out of turn, Woman, I want to hear what this foreigner has to say about it.”

If the setting had been somewhere a lot more casual, I would have broken the nose on that scowling face as compensation for his rude remark.

Seeing no other way out of this, I did what Naeem didn’t want. I told Suffian a summary of the true translation. All the while, I could see Naeem’s head lowered and tears wetting the dust at his feet. At one point, Mia placed a hand on his shoulder, only for him to pull away aggressively. Suffian noticed the gesture.

Suffian nodded his head when I finished, “Good.”

There was a drawn-out silence as I awaited some comment from the politician about the supernatural events within the text.

Suffian turned to the group of archaeologists standing next to us and addressed their team leader, Milad. “We will recommence the excavations today. I want that marble slab broken through by whatever means necessary.”

I was aghast. It was as though Suffian had been deaf to the entire warning that had been the purpose of the text.

Milad inclined his head, “Sir, shall we not try to preserve the entire slab? Itself is an artefact worthy of care.”

“Did you take plenty of photos of it?” Suffian said.

“Well, yes. But-

“Thats good enough. We have the translated text and visual reference. We do not need to keep it. What lies behind it is a treasure far more worthy of retaining.”

Now Naeem stepped forward, gone was his miserable and subservient composure. He stood before Suffian, head held high in defiance, his features twisted in disgust. “Will you not heed the warning?” he snapped.

Suffian sneered at the professor, and for the first time, chuckled. “What warning? All I hear is Christian garbage. As a Muslim, I do not believe that Jesus the Prophet was divine, therefore any reference to the Christian story of his birth is irrelevant to me.”

“But what if it is?” Naeem pleaded. “Allah willed the secondary seal according to the text. We can’t just ignore it!”

Suffian hawked and spat a large gobbet of phlegm at Naeem’s feet. “You are a blaspheming infidel to believe Allah had any part in. As I said, it is an offshoot of a key Christian story, therefore it is all a lie.” Suffian turned and addressed the gathered staff. “The excavations will recommence. Palestine will have claim to the true final resting place of King Herod.” He clapped his hands impatiently and gesticulated for everyone to hurry off to commence their work. None disobeyed.

Instead of following the order, Naeem stood there laughing. Suffian turned to him and slapped him hard across the face. It did little to falter his unexpected joviality. He pointed a finger at Suffian as he spoke, “You claim to be a devout Muslim. Look at you! You refuse to believe that the warning was placed by Allah, yet you clearly believe the story enough to have such a strong certainty Herod is in there. Everything you just said, reeks of hypocrisy. You do not respect Allah. You are only compelled by greed which deafens you to His word, only allowing your ears to perceive that which you want to hear.”

In a swift motion, Suffian buried his hand in one of his pants pockets and pulled out a switch blade. Before any of us could react, he lunged at Naeem and stabbed him three times in the throat.

Mia screamed and attempted to run to the professor’s side, but was held back by one of Hamza’s security personnel. Another came to my side, but I was too frozen in shock for him to have to restrain me. I watched with wide eyes as Naeem held his bleeding throat, gasping for breath as blood bubbled around his mouth. He looked at me for a brief moment and moved his mouth where I could just make out the words, “Don’t open it”. He then collapsed face first on the dusty ground and was no more.

“You fucking bastard!” Mia screamed at Suffian, who was crouched beside Naeem indifferently wiping the blood off his blade on his shirt. “He only spoke the truth!”

Suffian stood up and stepped towards her, holding his now cleaned knife to her face. For an agonizing moment, I was certain she would be following Naeem.

“Truth!!” Suffian spat. “I see the truth! That Naeem and you knew all along what was written on that wall. That you only brought this foreigner in, to delay the further excavations!”

I could see Mia about to come up with something, and fear for her wellbeing took a hold of me. “It’s true!” I shouted. “Naeem only brought me here to delay the dig, as you said. But Mia had no part in it! She stressed to the professor that it was folly to do so. But he refused to listen to her. And now look where he ended up. Please, let Mia go!”

Suffian flicked his blood red eyes to me and snickered. “I admire your heroics, foreigner, but don’t think me a fool on how the world works. Your lover here, yes, it’s obvious that she is, is equally as guilty as the professor. Herself being a Christian, and a pretty one at that, I am not surprised that a Muslim like Naeem would turn his back on Allah and believe the lie. Women are excellent at seeping their poison into a respectable man’s mind.”

His eyes fell to her throat, and I knew what his intentions were. In seconds this beautiful, sophisticated woman who had stolen my heart the moment I met her, would be killed. My mind scrambled for a way to save her whilst restrained.

“YOU NEED HER!” I roared. Suffian halted at that. “Now that Naeem is gone, she is the most superior historian tied to this project! Kill her, and you risk the integrity of whatever it is you find in there! Without a Historian, no one will believe the monumental discovery you are so adamant in making.”

Suffian lowered his knife and put it back in his pocket. He released his hold of Mia and she immediately collapsed into my arms, crying hard into my chest. I held her close as I glared at that monster of a man who dared to accuse her of being responsible for her superior’s beliefs.

“You are right, foreigner, thank you for staying my hand before impulse took it. I will spare her. But neither of you will have a part in this project until you are needed. I will not allow two Christians who had worked with one that was willing to delay the dig out of fear for a lie, to roam about and sow their ideas into good Muslims. Naeem has already cost me enough time, so you lot will not be given the chance to do the same.”

And so it was that Mia and I were imprisoned within Naeem’s accommodations. Suffian ordered Hamza to station security personnel at every window and door. For the first few minutes of this imprisonment we sat on the sofa as I held her trembling form close to me as she wept for Naeem. We were soon interrupted when Suffian barged through the door holding my laptop, opened up with its screen displaying the beginning of a Word document. It was the fabricated story we had intended to tell him. I sighed, knowing there was little I could do to get out of this situation. The paranoid fuck had wasted no time searching through “the foreigners” belongings.

I was roughly torn away from Mia who cried after me, and dragged by two security personnel to my accommodation. I was given another lecture by Suffian on his mistrust of Mia and I, followed by the flexing of his good faith to Allah. I received several punches and kicks by Hamza to drive home the point. They seized my laptop, phone and any other device they deemed I could use to communicate with the outside world, before I was finally left alone. Suffian made some small adjustments to our imprisonment, and a second team of personnel were needed to guard my accommodations. Mia and I were to remain separated for the duration of incarceration.

Little happened for the next month. When I wasn’t worrying about Mia’s wellbeing, I spent most of my solitude in reflection on the text. I was fortunate enough to still have the original translation folder, so I re read it a number of times. With each reading I became evermore certain that Salome was telling the truth and that God truly did send his Herald down to prompt her to ensure the tomb remained sealed forever.

I reflected on one of the chilling lines towards the end of the text: *There is no knowing what position God will be in to counter them.*

What could possibly tie up the supposed omniscient creator of everything so much that he couldn’t send down a single Herald to shun the Spirits again? It was infuriating that the Herald had mentioned the nature of the Spirits bitterness, but nothing on ways they could be countered without God’s intervention. It only stressed the doom and gloom that awaited those that decided to open it up. A.K.A, us.

I was no expert on the supernatural, or even God for that matter, but I was certain there would be a means for us mortals to counter them. It just needed to be discovered first.

Despite their orders, most of the security personnel were actually quite easy going, and allowed for Mia and I to exchange hand written notes. She had been the first to send one, and it was such a relief when I read it and learned she was unharmed. My heart swelled with the knowledge that she had been the one to take the initiative to ask the guard to allow the exchange. The thought had not once crossed my mind.

I replied with an update on my own wellbeing, followed by a bit of a chiding for her initial interruption when I was about to tell Suffian the fabricated story we had been working on. I stressed that I loved her, but was certain that if she had not done what she did, perhaps Naeem may still be alive. It wasn’t till the next day when I received her answer:

*“Delusion drove Naeem during those last days of his life. If we revealed the fabricated account, it would have changed nothing. Suffian would not have been happy with that and we would have been searched soon after. They would have found the true translation, and you can imagine what would have happened to all of us as a result.*

*Though, I say all this now, but at the time that was far from what compelled me to intervene. I did it for you, Corey. Words cannot describe how much I love you, and the thought of you lying and compromising your very life, tore my heart in two. I will do anything for you. If there is a pathway that would see us both out of this place, spared from both Suffian, and the coming potential wrath of the Spirits, know that I have every intention of spending the rest of my life with you. That is, if you’d be happy to?”*

Fuck yes, I was.

Finally, forty days later, the door to my accommodation swung open, and Suffian entered. He was accompanied by Hamza, Milad and to my upmost joy, Mia. Her beautiful smile made my heart melt.

 I was about to charge towards her and bury her in my arms when Hamza stepped forward and pushed me back.

“This is a professional meeting, foreigner, not a reunion party,” Suffian said in a condescending manner. “Keep your emotions towards the woman restrained, for we have come after achieving a major milestone in the excavations of the tomb and will be needing to recommence your services very soon.”

I looked at Mia, eyes wide at this new development but she merely shrugged.

My chest began to tighten as I asked Suffian, “Has the tomb been unearthed?”

Suffian gestured for Milad to fill me in.

“Nearly. After breaking through the marble slab, we reached the original seal.” Milad said this with clear reluctance. I knew Milad would be crying inside for having been ordered to destroy the beautiful hand marked wall. It was simply a violation to his very responsibility as an Archaeologist, that being to preserve. “The first drill has finally entered the void behind the original seal, having bored for about half a meter. There is more drilling taking place as we speak. They should have the integrity of the rock compromised enough to be broken down and removed for a human to enter. I believe this can be achieved within the week.”

So now the fun begins, I thought.

“You and Mia are to be present when we enter the tomb for the first time,” Suffian said, before turning to Hamza and chuckling. “If there are Spirits in there at least they’ll get to meet two who believed in their existence.”

I shuddered at the thought.

That was literally all that Suffian had to tell me, and left with a spring in his step. In a way I hoped that the Spirits existed and meant to bring us harm. At least they could unleash their wrath on that arrogant man.

Milad and Mia remained and we continued to be filled in by the head Archaeologist on some of the finds they had already made. Hamza watched over us, but allowed Mia to be next to me, where we held hands tightly as we listened to Milad.

What was at first thought to be some discolouration on the surface of the original seal, turned out to be ancient dried up blood. It was predominantly smeared about on one side of the stone, and upon closer examination, contained multiple fingerprints. It was evident that there were at least nineteen individuals who had been present, touching the stone for whatever reason, with either bleeding, or bloody hands.

I recalled from the text that the tomb had been opened twice, maybe three times. The first being to place the bodies of the children and the Thugs within, the second when all the events towards the end of the text took place.

“Did you read the translation?” I asked Milad.

He sighed. “I have,” he then lowered his voice so that it was little more than a whisper, “And yes, I do believe what it says, even though nothing unnatural has happened since the drill pierced into it.”

“Yet,” I said.

He nodded reluctantly. “May Allah forgive me for defying Him.”

“Would you say these bloody hand prints line up with the text?”

Mia spoke up. “Well, isn’t it obvious! The fingerprints are situated predominantly on one side of the large stone. Most likely candidate? The men who had killed the children and rolled the stone in place the first time.”

“Or the soldiers who slew the thugs,” I added. “They somehow seem to be forgotten.”

Milad’s face turned pale. “I think there is a reason they were forgotten. Because they were not the ones who killed the thugs. The blood came from the thugs hands as they opened the tomb to place the bodies within… but I don’t think they ever saw the light of day after that.”

“So, what are you saying? Herod and Antipater alone killed them?”

Milad whispered again. “The children did.”

I felt my chest tighten and a chill run down my spine. It was an absurd notion, but somehow, I knew it to be the truth. Mia’s grip on my hand tightened further.

Hamza was momentarily distracted by one of his subordinates. I jumped at the brief window of opportunity. “Listen,” I whispered urgently, “there must be a way we can counter these Spirits if God is not able to intervene.”

“Intervene!” Milad said, aghast, “Corey, we are disobeying Allah, which means His back will be turned on us. If there is to be any sort of counter, then let it be Allah’s forgiveness. Though, at this point, I fear not even grovelling in Mecca will get His attention.”

In the end, I knew Milad spoke true. We were the ones not heeding the warning; therefore, we were destined to suffer for our ignorance.

Hamza came back and ordered Mia and Milad to accompany him back out. Before she could leave my side, I kissed her passionately on the lips, knowing it would be the last time we could do so before entering the tomb. There was a high chance it was our last kiss.

As I hugged her, I whispered into her ear. “When we enter it, no matter what happens, stay by my side. Fuck, Suffian. If the Spirits are to torment us, then together we will endure it.”

She pulled away, smiling through her glassy eyes, “makes a great synopsis for a tragic romance. Two star crossed lovers, forced to enter a cursed tomb against their will, refusing to leave each-others side as they are tormented by evil spirits for eternity.”

I wish I could disagree with her, but knew I’d only be lying.

Hamza pulled her away, and once again I was left alone.

This is not about any romantic relationship but rather about friendship. This will be a long one hehe sorry po.

I felt like I would never find a genuine friendship from other people. I have few people that I consider as my friends. Mabibilang sa daliri. Three from elem to jhs, two from shs, and one bestfriend.

The problem is I easily get turned off sa isang tao, especially friends. Kasi I’m very observant and I hate it when I sense that they could be taking advantage of me, especially when it’s about money (or maybe it’s a “me” problem?) 

Context: I’m kinda well-off (please don’t take this as kayabangan), minsan nakakaluwag luwag, minsan may pera, may mga basic needs and nakakabili naman kahit papaano ng wants. Pero not to the extend, i also think im generous when i have money, nanlilibre ako pero hindi yung sobra. But I’m the kind of person na if it’s my personal things and my money, im not comfortable lending it to the others (nawawalan ako ng peace of mind). Now, this one girl ‘friend’ from jhs ask me to hang out after new year, since she’s an old friend and very close naman kami before, I said yes and I’ll be going (take note, from lipa ako and she was studying in green school now, i have to travel to her dorm, but no problem with that) very okay naman kami, still chikahan, and all.

Then, we hang out, may money siya, green school ba naman, pero not super rich rich din, she likes buying expensive things and gifting herself. Now, my whole money is 10k, im very hesitant in buying myself things kasi minsan lang naman ako magkaroon ng huge amount of money. I tried to limit myself from few makeups from local brands and one shoes kasi need ko na talaga. Spending around 3k+. And there I said to myself, I won’t be spending anymore, only for kain na lang and coffee. And she has many things to buy, no problem, may money sya e (sabi niya) my only role is helping her not to make any indecisive decisions. She bought, make ups, one expensive cloth, and bought a shoes as well. So okay, goods kami dyan, pera naman niya e. Now, when I was about to check my money, she suddenly asked me kung magkano dala kong money, I said, 10k. Pero 6,500 na lang halos natitira, now she asked me to buy more, pushing me to different stores but i said no, im trying to limit myself, she offered to give me extra pa nga daw.

Now na ayaw ko na, she suddenly shifts to siya na lang daw bibili, she really wants this bag kasi, around 2k, i asked her how much pa money niya, she said may 2k pa siya, i told her, “go buy it if you need that” then she suddenly said, “ay wag na lang walang matitira kasi sakin, my dad would be mad, kung nay extra money pa sana ako.” wtf, sa dami na ng nagastos mo, need mo pa talaga ng extra money.

I told her na dinner na kami and I will be going home na kasi gagabihin pa ako, lipa pa ako e, then suddenly she looked disappointed. And what made me feel irritated is when she continued saying “hay nako, if only i have extra money talaga I would buy that bag kasi ill be busy na, di ko na siya mabibili after baka magrestock na sila” and it kept happening for good 1 hour. Naririndi na ako, and i insisted na gastusin niya na yung last money niya if she reallywant to buy it and she kept saying no, na parang maiiyak na, mukhang pagod na magmaparinig sa akin. Lmao. 

So i get it nga, she wants me to lend her money, so me feeling like I have to, i said, “Go na, get the bag, hiramin mo na lang muna extra money ko, pay me when my class resumes,” and si accla, nagliwanag ang mukha and keeps on saying no and nakakahiya daw pero naglalakad na siya towards the store. So yun, ending almost more than 4k na lang natira sakin. I just felt like she took advantage of me. And i feel offended.

From the moment she booked, we had a feeling she might be high maintenance—and we weren’t wrong.  


Here’s the situation:

•	She asked heaps of questions (despite us providing a comprehensive guide).

•	When she arrived, she immediately started nitpicking:

•	Dirt in the vacuum chamber

•	Fingerprints on the silver side of the toaster

•	Marks in the sink

There were a couple of valid points:

•	Coffee pods were left in the machine.

•	Outdoor seating was dusty (it lives under a tree).

We offered to send our cleaner to address her concerns, but she declined. Now, she’s requesting we refund the $150 cleaning fee.

For most of my life, I’ve been waking up around 8–9 AM and sleeping 10–11 hours. And while that might sound like a dream to some people, it’s not as great as it seems. Whenever I sleep that much, I feel more tired, like I just spent 11 hours dreaming about running a marathon or something. My mornings are stressful, my mood swings are wild, and it’s like I’m stuck in this never-ending cycle of grogginess.

However, he soon finds himself to be the protector of an incompetent but positive nobleman vying for the crown after the recent death of the king. Together, they must brave the monster-infested wild plains with 6 other pairs of nobles and protectors to retrieve an artifact that will not only grant the noble who retrieves it leadership of the kingdom but will also seal the wild plains off from the rest of the world and curb the monster population that is growing exponentially with each failed expedition into the wild plains. Knowing his remaining family will not survive long without him, can Orion survive the wild plains, protect his noble counterpart, put an end to the increasing monster leakage from the plains, and earn his freedom to return home to Everheaven?

Hey everyone, I am working on the second draft of my second novel. It is dramatically different from the first draft already and I would like some feedback on the story so far. Specifically, I am looking to see if the plot makes sense and if I am effectively avoiding fillers in my writing. Other constructive criticism is welcome. There are a few grammatical/spelling issues that I plan to clean up during my third draft, but hopefully, they won't be too distracting at the moment. Let me know if you would like to give my golden goose a gander!

I am open to critique swaps of similar word counts.

**First two pages (521 words):** Spring was on its way, but winter wasn’t finished yet. The morning frost had receded into the earth like the white-veiled ghost it was. Orion’s breath still caught in the air, forming a small cloud of condensation that he immediately broke through in his stride toward the city. He already regretted the deer skin-lined coat he slipped on by candlelight. Kel had made it with a local hunter boy’s kill and had gifted it to Orion for his birthday. It made the winter bite bearable, but the moment it grew warm outside, the coat acted like a hot sponge.

He was already running late, but Orion knew he couldn’t show up drenched in sweat. It would give him away in an instant. He had to at least appear to be half-way wealthy to scam the gold-lined pockets of traveling nobles.

A fork in the cobblestone path came up and Orion lept off the path about 15 feet. He found a hollowed-out tree trunk a few summers back and could trust that no one would stumble upon it unless they were desperately searching for the remnants of the dropped half-rotten pears from the tree above.

Orion stripped the deerskin coat off, already feeling the fur peel back from a wet stain that lined his back like river water. It would dry in the tree. Hopefully, it wouldn’t smell as bad as it did now when he returned.

The young man hurried back to the path, taking the fork in the road toward the city. The other way was nothing but woods, as far as he could tell. He had ventured down it a few times, but never made it more than ten miles before he felt more than one pair of eyes on him and had to turn around. Kel and Evan were completely banned from the deep forest. Orion was queasy enough going in himself. If either of those two entered, Orion wasn’t sure they would ever exit. The last thing anyone in the world wanted to do was to be alone in the woods at night. Unless you were a monster hunter.

Trees pocked either side of the mile-long stretch of loosened cobblestones toward the city limits. They were all uniform in color, grayish brown. Even at peak bloom, they were drab, barely tinting their ambiguous muddy color to something that resembled life, like the undercarriage of a land urchin.

The sun was just peaking over the city walls like a toddler’s eyes over a counter. Orion clenched his teeth and broke into a jog. He was late.

Everheaven City was anything but heaven. The grime-sodden streets filled with seedy merchants and dishonorably discharged soldiers were as far from heaven as you could possibly get. Orion vaulted a crate outside a small coffee shop window that was just being unlatched for the morning crowd as the mage lights adorning street posts like leaves began to flicker out one by one.

1hvj7ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_seekers/comments/1hvj7ah/how_vpns_enable_secure_online_banking_and/,How VPNs Enable Secure Online Banking and Financial Transactions,"Online banking and financial transactions have become an integral part of our daily lives, allowing us to easily manage accounts, pay bills, transfer money, and invest—all from the comfort of our homes or while on the go. However, as convenient as these services are, they come with security risks. Cybercriminals are always on the lookout for vulnerable connections to steal personal and financial data. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of the most effective tools for securing your online banking activities and protecting your financial transactions. In this post, we’ll explore how VPNs can enhance your online banking security, keep your financial data safe, and reduce the risk of cyberattacks.

1. Why You Need a VPN for Online Banking

The rise of online banking has made financial transactions more accessible but also exposed personal data to greater risks. Here are some of the reasons why a VPN is essential for securing your online banking activities:

1.1. Public Wi-Fi Security Risks

Many people access their bank accounts while using public Wi-Fi networks in places like coffee shops, airports, or hotels. Unfortunately, public Wi-Fi is often unsecured, making it a prime target for cybercriminals to intercept data and steal sensitive information, such as banking credentials or account numbers.

Why it matters: If you use an unsecured Wi-Fi network without a VPN, hackers can easily sniff your data and gain access to your personal and financial information.

1.2. Protecting Sensitive Financial Data

When you log into your online banking account or make financial transactions, you’re sending sensitive information—such as account numbers, PINs, and credit card details—over the internet. Without protection, this data can be intercepted by hackers or malicious entities.

Why it matters: A VPN encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your sensitive financial data remains private and secure while you’re accessing your bank accounts online.

1.3. Preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a hacker intercepts the communication between you and your bank’s server, allowing them to steal your login credentials or alter your transactions. This type of attack is common on unsecured networks, especially when accessing your online bank account from a public Wi-Fi hotspot.

Why it matters: A VPN encrypts your connection, preventing hackers from intercepting your communication and protecting you from MITM attacks.

2. How VPNs Secure Online Banking

VPNs enhance the security of online banking by creating a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. Here’s how a VPN helps protect your financial transactions:

2.1. Data Encryption for Secure Transactions

A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, converting it into unreadable code. Even if hackers manage to intercept the data, they won’t be able to read or use it. This encryption ensures that your login credentials, bank account details, and payment information remain private.

Why it matters: Encryption acts as a barrier that prevents third parties from accessing your sensitive financial data during online transactions.

2.2. Masking Your IP Address and Location

When you connect to the internet, your device uses an IP address that reveals your physical location. This information can be used by hackers to track your activity or launch targeted attacks. A VPN masks your real IP address and assigns you a new one from a server in a different location, making it harder for hackers to trace your online activity.

Why it matters: By hiding your real IP address, a VPN makes it more difficult for cybercriminals to target you, ensuring that your online banking activity remains private.

2.3. Secure Communication with Banks and Financial Institutions

Banks and other financial institutions use SSL encryption to secure communications between you and their servers. A VPN adds an additional layer of security by further encrypting your internet traffic, making it almost impossible for anyone to intercept or alter the data.

Why it matters: A VPN ensures that your communications with your bank are extra-secure, providing peace of mind while making financial transactions.

2.4. Protection from Phishing and Fraudulent Websites

Phishing scams are a common way for cybercriminals to trick users into entering their sensitive information on fraudulent websites. A VPN can block access to known phishing sites and other dangerous websites that may attempt to steal your financial credentials.

Why it matters: Using a VPN with built-in malware and phishing protection can help prevent you from accessing fake banking websites and falling victim to fraudulent schemes.

3. VPN Features for Securing Online Banking and Transactions

When choosing a VPN for secure online banking, it’s important to consider certain features that can enhance your protection. Here are the key features to look for in a VPN:

3.1. AES-256-Bit Encryption

Look for a VPN that offers AES-256-bit encryption, the industry standard for online security. This level of encryption is extremely difficult to crack and ensures that your data is protected during online banking transactions.

Why it matters: Strong encryption is essential for safeguarding sensitive financial information from hackers, especially when accessing online banking platforms.

3.2. No-Logs Policy

Choose a VPN provider with a no-logs policy, meaning they do not track or store your online activity. This ensures that even if authorities request data from the VPN provider, there is no personal information or banking activity to hand over.

Why it matters: A no-logs policy guarantees your privacy by ensuring that your financial transactions and browsing history remain confidential.

3.3. Kill Switch

A kill switch feature automatically disconnects your device from the internet if the VPN connection drops. This ensures that your financial data remains protected, even if the VPN connection fails unexpectedly.

Why it matters: A kill switch prevents your real IP address from being exposed and ensures that you are never transmitting unencrypted data while banking online.

3.4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Some VPN providers offer multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security when logging into your VPN account. This feature can be used in combination with your bank’s MFA to provide a double layer of protection.

Why it matters: Multi-factor authentication ensures that only you can access your VPN and your bank accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

3.5. Server Locations in Safe Regions

Choose a VPN that offers servers in regions with strong privacy laws and reliable security measures. This is especially important for online banking, as connecting to servers in regions with less strict privacy laws could expose your financial data to unnecessary risks.

Why it matters: Connecting to VPN servers in privacy-friendly regions ensures that your financial transactions are secure and your data is not at risk of exposure.

4. Best VPNs for Secure Online Banking and Transactions

Here are some top VPN providers that offer enhanced security features for online banking:

4.1. ExpressVPN

Why it’s great for banking: ExpressVPN is known for its strong encryption, fast speeds, and no-logs policy, making it an excellent choice for securing financial transactions and banking activities.

Key features: AES-256-bit encryption, 3,000+ servers in 94 countries, no-logs policy, and kill switch for added security.

4.2. NordVPN

Why it’s great for banking: NordVPN provides double encryption for added protection, making it ideal for securing financial data while banking online. It also has a strict no-logs policy and fast speeds.

Key features: AES-256-bit encryption, Double VPN for extra security, no-logs policy, and CyberSec for blocking malware and phishing.

4.3. CyberGhost

Why it’s great for banking: CyberGhost offers dedicated servers for secure browsing and banking, along with strong encryption and DNS leak protection to keep your data private.

Key features: AES-256-bit encryption, 7,000+ servers, no-logs policy, and DNS and IP leak protection.

4.4. Surfshark

Why it’s great for banking: Surfshark provides unlimited device connections and strong encryption with a no-logs policy, making it perfect for securing all your devices while performing financial transactions.

Key features: AES-256-bit encryption, unlimited simultaneous connections, no-logs policy, and multi-hop VPN for additional privacy.

5. Conclusion

A VPN is an essential tool for ensuring the security and privacy of your online banking and financial transactions. By encrypting your connection, masking your IP address, and offering features like kill switches and multi-factor authentication, a VPN helps protect your sensitive financial data from hackers and cybercriminals.

When selecting a VPN for online banking, make sure to choose a provider with strong encryption, reliable security features, and a no-logs policy to ensure your financial transactions are safe and secure.

”let me know if it ever does“

I guess my main concern is seeming like a creep or coming on too strong by asking her to meet after only one text exchange. But I’m also not sure what else to text her without it being incredibly random.

so does anyone have advice? Do I stop over thinking and just ask how she feels about the second semester?
