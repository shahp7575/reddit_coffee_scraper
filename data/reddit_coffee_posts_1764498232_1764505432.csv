A little about me: I always have a story to tell! I read a lot, and can always entertain with an anecdote or two. I enjoy live music, museums, farmers markets, and too much coffee!

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

1pagnin,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pagnin/i_dont_know_if_im_allowed_to_feel_hurt/,I don't know if I'm allowed to feel hurt,"I (20F) met this guy (20M) at a party the start of October and we immediately hit it off. We were both at another party the following week, and then one thing led to another and we basically started dating straight after that. When we first met, it came up that he had an 8-month-long exchange overseas, and I promised myself I wasn't going to allow myself to become too attached.

Fast forward 2 months, I have become attached. By this point he has met my parents (seemed very interested in meeting them), been inside my home, introduced me to his friends, told his parents about me, planned dates, sent me very lengthy texts each day about how his day was and what he has been up to. By this point we have not raised the exchange topic, and I am starting to get nervous because I know we probably should have had the discussion a week into dating.

We went for coffee last week and at the end of the coffee, right when I needed to leave, he drops the exchange topic. He says that he doesn't think it's worth doing long distance and it would be best to not continue it while he goes on exchange (he leaves just after new years). Meanwhile we are both on the train and I need to cut the conversation short to get off at my stop. Of course I don't expect him to do long distance considering we have only known each other for two months, but a part of me just felt really hurt. I know it was equally my responsibility to bring it up, but I was procrastinating the topic because I was liking where things were going and didn't want it to lead us prematurely ending the connection if things were going good.

Now I just feel really sad. Am I naive for thinking this could have worked while he went on exchange? Or at least for us to just stay friends? I feel stupid because I voiced my feelings toward him over text and it was received very coldly. It took him 5 days to get back to me and said that he has thought that it would feel awkward if we kept it going knowing that he could hurt me. This was despite me saying in my prior message that I would be ok with keeping seeing him until he leaves. I know I shouldn't have said I had feelings for him if I wanted to keep seeing him, but I just needed to be honest with myself.

I know he probably did the ""right"" thing, but I just feel like maybe this entire time he only saw this as casual - even just physical - and that upsets me. I saw him at a party the day before he sent the final ""end"" message and he blanked me for most of the night and only said hello once because we were in a group setting.

Am I losing my mind for being so hurt over this? He has gone from being so warm and affectionate to completely icing me out - all within the span of a week. I have never experienced this before.

I sent him a pretty harsh message back expressing the way i felt about it. I agreed that we should stop seeing each other, and the message was very final. I said it would have been more respectful for him to have done this in-person rather than over text. I don't think he will respond to that. I think we are done completely.

I do have such a soft spot for him and care about him but I am nearly certain - based on his response - that he doesn't feel the same about me. He just seemed so forward and affectionate in the beginning.",1,1764504073.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

——————————

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-27462-3) in *Nature Scientific Reports* published on Friday claims that Africa’s forests as a whole have crossed “a critical **transition from a carbon sink to a carbon source** between 2010 and 2017,” mostly as a result of “deforestation in tropical moist broadleaf forests as a primary driver of biomass loss.” Although the continent allegedly gained woody biomass for a few years in 2007-2010, the following 7 years saw larger biomass losses that offset these gains.

A ""**grounding line**"" is where a glacier or ice sheet transitions from sitting on land to floating on the ocean. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-06023-3) from a few weeks ago examines the rate of retreat for a number of Antarctic glaciers and their grounding lines, and found mixed results. Some have not appreciably retreated in the last 30 years, while others have **moved over 400m/year**—and in a few cases, more than 600m/year. 

A 20-page WWF [report](https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/technical-brief--amazon-footprint-report--en-.pdf) on the Amazon rainforest pinpointed “pasture expansion as a direct driver of deforestation across the Amazon region, responsible – according to our estimates – for **78% of immediate deforestation** activity between 2018 and 2022….A combination of cash crops (such as soy, oil palm, cocoa, and coffee) and crops commonly considered staples (such as rice and sorghum) is associated with this expansion.” Cattle ranching has, from 2020-2022, had a decrease in the impact to deforestation (although still significant), while the impact from maize and oil palms has risen.

The rain patterns predicted (in 2016) for Europe in the year 2048 are happening now, thanks to climate change’s impact accelerating atmospheric conditions across the continent. That’s what [a study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ae198b) in *Environmental Research Letters* says, anyway: “the magnitude of observed changes is approximately 23 years ahead of the CMIP6 multi-model mean predictions….current adaptation strategies, based on multi-model means, may **underestimate the near-term risk of climate-related hazards**, and therefore require critical re-evaluation.” The authors also conclude that the **risk of flooding in northern Europe “is substantially underestimated”** for the future, and is also currently greater than climate models estimate. Drought in Europe’s Mediterranean regions is also underestimated by many old/current climate models.

So much for 1.5 °C. Temperatures are [already **1.81 °C above**](https://x.com/EliotJacobson/status/1992939715394486454) average temperatures for late November, and [surface temps are seeing **new daily highs**](https://x.com/EliotJacobson/status/1994035456082891194). A [strong hot/cold divide](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1992585044033196291) emerged in Europe last week, with temperatures in central Europe as cold as January, and temperatures in eastern Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Türkiye as hot as July. A [new minimum temp](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1992411059446305150) was set on one of Japan’s distant Pacific islands, at 26.9 °C (80 °F). [New November records in northern China](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1992883580364808407) were set at a number of spots as well.

The UK [lost more land to **wildfire in 2025**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/uk-wildfires-more-areas-in-2025-than-since-records-began) than in any previous year on record—and more-than-doubled its burnt area when compared to the terrible 2022 summer. 2025 saw area (470 sq. km) a little more than twice the size of Ibiza lost to blazes, as of November 2025. Meanwhile, data released by Iraq’s government indicate that, from 2021 to 2024, the [percent of fully desertified land rose about 50%](https://shafaq.com/en/society/Over-half-of-Iraq-now-at-risk-of-desertification-ministry-warns), to 40,400 sq km—23% of the country. **More than half the country is at risk of desertification.**

Flood protection funding has stopped, typhoons are more frequent, beds have been raised to stand above the water that’s made itself a permanent guest in people’s living rooms. There’s nowhere to go, and nowhere for people to store their stuff.

A [volcano erupted in northeastern Ethiopia](https://phys.org/news/2025-11-volcano-erupts-northern-ethiopia-ash.html), not far from Eritrea, last weekend, sending ash and sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the sky—nobody was reported killed. Yet [scientists say the **unknown and underestimated volcanoes**](https://phys.org/news/2025-11-world-volcanoes-pose-greatest-threat.html) pose the greatest dangers to us, because they are not monitored or well understood. 

Preparations are being made for [an ambitious **quasi-geoenginering attempt**](https://phys.org/news/2025-11-ambitious-beneath-north-sea.html) to pump liquid CO2 over a mile deep below the seafloor, into a former oil field in the North Sea, sometime next year. 363,000 metric tons are hoped to be deposited in 2026, with operations eventually scaling up to 7.3M metric tonnes by next decade—roughly equivalent to the annual CO2 production of Luxembourg (pop: 680,000), El Salvador (pop: 6.3M), or Uganda (pop: 51M) each year. 

A [paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-025-00740-4) in *Nature* concluded that **high-elevation mountains are warming 0.21 °C faster than lowlands**, when looked at over a century. Although the study is inconclusive with regards to future precipitation differences between these two region types, “models predict that enhanced warming in mountain regions will continue.” The lead author adds, “As temperatures rise, trees and animals are moving higher up the mountains, chasing cooler conditions. But eventually, in some cases, they'll run out of mountain and **be pushed off the top**.” It’s a long way down… 

A [complex study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02484-x) in *Nature Climate Change* examined changes in ocean chemistry over the past 60 years. The writers say that **compounding “climatic impact-drivers”** like “surface and subsurface ocean warming, salinity variations, acidification, deoxygenation” are threatening the ocean’s future health and resilience, “and even the deep ocean—once considered stable—is responding more rapidly than we thought.” They attempt to determine the time of emergence (ToE)—that is, the timespan in which these metrics went off the walls. Some stressors, like surface ocean acidification, occurred (and are still occurring) much faster than other factors (like salinity concentrations). The study’s graphics help illustrate the  “**transition to a different ocean state** in a warming climate” that we are beginning to witness, and their interrelationship.

A [debrief on the **COP30 negotiations**](https://www.carbonbrief.org/revealed-leak-casts-doubt-on-cop30s-informal-list-of-fossil-fuel-roadmap-opponents/) paints a complicated and contradicting picture of the talks. Some states which claimed to support the fossil fuel phaseout were actually against it, and vice versa. Multinational groups, like the AU and EU, which claimed to support the proposed roadmap to a greener future, contained member-states (like Nigeria and Czechia) that opposed the proposal as worded, or were otherwise **playing a double-game** that never took a solid stance. Apparently the various groups and talks became too complex and overlapping for a solid deal to be worked out—probably just what the lobbyists were designing. 

An [interesting study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-025-02275-w) on the levels of “**nature connectedness**” across 61 countries, and associated a kind of spirituality with stronger feelings to nature. **Nepal placed #1**, followed by Iran, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Nigeria (#5). Placing last among surveyed nations was Spain, above which placed Japan, Israel, Germany, and Canada. The **U.S. was #49**. The experts concluded that “several objective (urbanicity and business environment) and subjective country indicators (scientific and religious values) were significantly associated with nature connectedness.” Of course, people with higher connectedness to nature were found to act in pro-environment ways.

Unless we develop more accurate models faster than the rate of uncertain events occurring, we will remain behind the environmental changes of the future.

↠ An [**American intervention on Venezuela’s land**](https://archive.ph/8nSqp) appears to be drawing closer and closer. President Trump [declared the closure of Venezuela’s air space](https://archive.ph/JoOgq); operations could begin as early as next week—although I think 2026 is more likely. How far will these aggressive negotiations go until land bombings/invasions begin?

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-We may be heading towards **3 °C warming…by 2050**. So say a couple German science agencies; [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1p6mrsd/global_warming_at_3_c_by_2050_whats_behind_the/) and its comments (and the [linked article](https://worldcrunch.com/focus/green-or-gone/global-warming-at-3c-by-2050-what-s-behind-the-new-german-climate-warning/) from October) explain how the IPCC predictions may have gotten it all wrong.

1pagjc2,https://i.redd.it/uqdx5sddvd4g1.jpeg,DECANTIFIED 28 decant reviews. Odyssey Toffee Coffee and Odyssey Black Forest,"* All decants are 3-5 weeks old, and the bottles they came from are *who knows* how old. So all aged enough.  

* Go straight to ""PROFILE TLDR"" if you don't like my rambling.  

Let's start with the decanter. Some of the best prices out there, selection is good, but not at the ""top dogs"" level yet. Packaging is THE BEST, and feels like luxury. The decant bottles are average quality though. One (Marwa) was leaking, but one out of 28 is not a big deal. 3 of the labels started peeling off. Overall, because of the price factor (they're currently ruling the #2 spot in [My chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/XdexkqsG8G)), it's a value of 8.8. if they had the aluminum atomizers of Decantbox, and more rugged labels, it would be a 10.0. I was told the peeling issue has been rectified, and that the packaging is even prettier now... But I can only confirm that next time, so stay tuned.  

#ODYSSEY TOFFEE COFFEE:  
I expected I'm gonna fall in love with this... And I didn't. Also, after my (amazing) experience with Odyssey Dubai Chocolat, I expected this to be nuclear... Also no.  

Surprisingly, it starts with a hint of freshness (my guess is the bergamot), but quickly (5-10 minutes) settles into a creamy coffee caramel/toffee scent. Not as complex as Dubai Chocolat or Qahwa, but definitely smoother than Qahwa, with no spiciness to it. There's a bit of Ambery sweetness in the back, but it stays mainly a sugary sweet roasted coffee fragrance. Not bad at all. You can think of it as a sweeter and more youthful take on Spectre Wraith or Black Phantom. You know what Coconut Lagoon did to the Virgin Island Water DNA? That's what this one is doing to the Black Phantom DNA. Can't say I don't like it, but it's not even a top 20 winter for me.  


**PROFILE TLDR**: Simplistic sweet (but not ""too sweet"") roasted coffee scent.  

**Subjective Scent Score**:7.2  
 **Longevity**: 7 hours  
 **Projection**: Medium for the first 2 hours, them small scent bubble another 2 hours, then skin scent.  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 7.7. safer than Qahwa or Odyssey Dubai Chocolat... Because of the more simplistic profile.  
 **Unisex Score**: 55% Male leaning. The roasted coffee is in the center of the stage.  
 **Versatility Score**: 6.5. winter-fall only.  
 **Blend Quality Score**:7.0. Average clone quality.     
 **Value Score**: 5.5. $40 at Jomashop, for a pretty weak fragrance, with a very simplistic profile.  
 **Bottle design**:6.0   
 **Atomizer Score**: N/A  
 **Conclusion**: I'm happy I didn't blind buy it!   


#ODYSSEY BLACK FOREST:  
Holy shit... They really did it! This smells EXACTLY like a Black Forest Cake! At first, it's pretty similar to Odyssey Dubai Chocolat, but give it 5-10 minutes, and you'll get dark chocolate (not in the notes, but it's there), a bit of caramel, a nice boozy cherry note, and a vanilla/Tonka background. Beautiful scent profile. The performance is slightly above average. My only problem with it is the quality. I'm usually no quality snob, but most Armaf don't make the cut for me, and this is one of them. Kind of the quality you get with Choco Musk by Al Rehab.  

**PROFILE TLDR**: Smells just like a Black Forest Cake.  

**Subjective Scent Score**: 8.4.    
 **Longevity**: 8 hours.  
 **Projection**: 1 hour strong (but not a room filler), then 2 hours moderate, then 1 hour of low scent bubble before it's a skin scent.    
 **Blind buy safety score**:6.0. A very niche profile. Not many people would be looking forward to smelling like a Black Forest cake.  
 **Unisex Score**: Perfectly unisex.  
 **Versatility Score**: 3.5. See above.  
 **Blend Quality Score**: 6.0. below average clone quality... Average Armaf quality.  
 **Value Score**: 7.5. $32 (USD) at Perfumeonline, for low quality, but good performance.  
 **Bottle design**: 6.0

I’m trying to identify a book from my childhood (I’m from the 90s), but my memories are very fragmented. I’ll describe everything I remember in detail — hopefully someone will recognize it.

# What I remember about the book

* It was a **large hardcover book**, more like a **coffee-table art book** than a children’s book.
* I saw it as a child in the **1990s**, but it might have been published earlier (possibly 70s–90s).
* It was written in **English**.
* It was **NOT a children’s book**: the illustrations were **dark, realistic, and atmospheric**, not cartoonish.
* Most illustrations were **full-spread (two-page)** artworks.
* Not whimsical or colorful — **it was moody and atmospheric**.

# Illustration style

* Very **realistic**, detailed, almost hyper-realistic.
* **Dark / muted color palette** — not vibrant or pastel.
* **Oniric / surreal atmosphere**, sometimes slightly eerie.
* Animals were **anthropomorphic** (e.g., a heron or crane holding and playing a saxophone).
* Style was somewhat similar to Scott Gustafson’s animal musicians, **but much darker, heavier, and more realistic**.

# Themes and imagery

* The central theme was a **large orchestra or parade of birds**.
* Birds played **musical instruments**: brass, strings, winds, etc.
* I clearly remember:
   * A **conductor bird** directing the orchestra.
   * Birds playing **saxophones, trumpets, violins**, etc.
* I *think* there might have been **frogs or toads** also playing instruments, but I’m not 100% sure.
* Each double-page spread seemed to have a **musical theme**.
* There was **some text**, maybe a short story or descriptive captions, but the book was mainly focused on the art.

If anyone recognizes it, I’d be incredibly grateful.

1pagi3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pagi3z/how_do_you_know_when_your_drinking_is_actually_a/,How do you know when your drinking is actually a problem?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 25F and I’ve been trying to figure out whether my drinking is ''normal for my age'' or if it's genuinely becoming a problem. I feel confused and feel like I should be worried. I'd really appreciate some outside opinions or similar experiences from people who've been there.

I drink about 2-3 times a week. Maybe once in that mix I'll have only 2-3 drinks, and that's usually because the *other* person has to go home early. The rest of the time, I get properly drunk. Being hungover every other day has basically been normal for me for years.

I've been drinking regularly since I was 18, and while I didn't drink as heavily back then, I've definitely built up a tolerance. Most of my social circle drinks a lot, but.. after two or three drinks, something switches in me and I never want the night to end. I start buying shots just so I'm not drinking alone, and I end up pushing the night way further than anyone planned.

I also get myself into weird or reckless situations. Talking to strangers, staying with random people after my friends leave, falling off my bike, waking up with random bruises. A couple years ago, I literally locked myself out on a first-floor balcony while drunk, and because no one knew I was there and my phone was inside, I ended up trying to climb down and broke my foot. That was one of the most surreal ''wtf am I doing?'' moments, and yet… nothing really changed.

And it's not just nights out. Recently, I had dinner at my brother's house with his girlfriend. We planned to buy *one* bottle of wine. I pushed for two, even though we had wine at home. I ended up drinking nearly the whole bottle by myself. I even quietly put the empty bottle in the bin so they wouldn't see how much I'd had.  
Then, another day, I went for dinner at my aunt and uncle's. Later in the evening, he decided to open the second really nice bottle of red. (after I drank most of the first one). ''For us,'' he said. With the idea that they could save the rest for later that week… and somehow I still finished almost the entire thing. Sneakily. Casually. But I knew exactly what I was doing.

I've also realised something about how I drink socially. When I go out for a drink with a friend, the plan is usually to have an easy night. But once I have those first two drinks, if my friend wants to leave early, I immediately start thinking about how to extend the night. I'll start texting anyone I know to see who's out, just to keep going. Even when I know I should go home, I can't help thinking about grabbing just one more.  
It's not that I want to drink alone, I rarely do now, but the pull of alcohol in social situations is so strong, so… enticing. It's like it flips a switch, and suddenly keeping the night going becomes the most important thing.

I've also sometimes been the person at parties, after like 4 am, I will go around picking up half-finished drinks...  
Or I'd come home from a party and stop at a corner shop at 1am to buy more alcohol just so I could drink one more. I'd have intense drunken conversations with my relationships or friends, flirt with everyone, act loud and fun and charismatic, but the next day I'd feel ashamed, realised I asked super intense questions and wonder why I can't just be normal.

And the biggest thing I'm realising: so many of the fights I've had with friends came from me drinking too much and crossing a line. Saying too much. Staying out too long. Making dumb decisions. Wanting ''one more bar, one more drink, one more shot.'' But then I also have friends who drink as heavily as I do, so sometimes I can convince myself that it's just the environment. Sometimes I wonder if I've just surrounded myself with people who drink like me, so I never had to question it, and then sometimes I wonder if *I'm* the problem friend. Maybe I'm the bitch. But then I am not sure, cause I never would judge anyone else for going too far either. And ill never get so drunk to slur my words, and ill always get home on my own.

I recently moved back to my home country and I'm not working right now, also went through a breakup a few months back, so drinking has become an easy way to fill time and connect with people, as I feel a bit lonely. But it also scares me that I don't want to leave the house unless it involves alcohol. I don't want to hang out unless alcohol is guaranteed. And if it isn't, and we're just grabbing coffee (cause im trying to be responsible), Ill prob ask to grab a cheeky beer after we had our cozy coffee. And when I *do* spend time with someone I love and don't drink, it's so genuinely nice, but at the same time also kind of boring, so I barely ever do that.

I've slowed down compared to my worst years. Last year I even did a month sober and felt so proud of myself. And right now I can sometimes go 5-6 days without drinking, but only because I know that if I have ''just three,'' I'll want more. It's like I'm always chasing a feeling. Alcohol makes everything easier and more fun, but the consequences are starting to feel too heavy.

And yes, I know everyone says the day after ''I'm never drinking again'' when they're hungover. But with me, it feels deeper than the cliché. I am so annoyed that i often can't trust myself once I start.

I also kind of want to stop now, but there's always something in the way. In three weeks, I have a dinner coming up with people who are big drinkers, and I know I'll feel like I *have* to drink. It won't be fun if I don't, and I worry I won't be fun either. I'll tell myself I can pace myself, but the truth is, there's always some event, some night, some excuse that pulls me back in. And then Christmas, New Year's! So now I tell myself, ''in the new year'' maybe then? It feels like there's never a clean starting point to really step away. 

A friend once suggested I try an AA meeting just to hear people's experiences, even if I'm not a ''classic alcoholic.'' Another friend told me not to go unless I'm fully committed to stopping. So now I don't even know if AA is something I'm ''allowed'' to try, or if I'm overthinking all of this.

So my question is:

**How do you know when drinking has crossed into an actual problem, especially if you don't drink alone as much, don't crave alcohol in the morning, and can function, but you still feel out of control socially? And if drinking makes life feel easier, how do you even start to pull away from that?**

**Also: Do I need to stop stop? How do you pace myself?**

I think I'm not the stereotypical idea of an alcoholic, but the tendencies are there, and they scare me. I wonder who I'd be without alcohol. I wonder what friendships and opportunities I've lost. I wonder what life would feel like if I didn’t spend half my week hungover. And I wonder how much of this is ''normal 20s drinking,'' and how much is me ignoring a pattern that's been here for years.

If anyone has been in a similar situations, or is in this weird middle space as well, where you're the fun drunk friend, but inside you feel ashamed, reckless, and out of control, I'd really love to hear your experiences.

As you see from the title I have a type, but unfortunately there aren’t many of you - and it doesn’t really happen to meet you irl, hence I’m here; I don’t have high expectations but there’s no harm in trying.
If you see yourself in the description and live in London, I’d be happy if you carry on reading.
About me:
5’ 4, slim/athletic build, longish dark red hair, brown eyes, fair skin, young looking - according to people.
Straight and (ideally) looking for a long term relationship if we’re compatible.
I’m childfree by choice for life - I adore dogs though!
I love keeping fit and being healthy: hiking and kayaking are 2 of my favourite outdoor activities.
I also like cozy time at home reading, watching a film with a plot (especially crime stories) or having a nice meal.
Teetotal, non smoker and drug free from birth.
Coffee lover.
70s/80s rock/hard rock music is another passion of mine.
I’m into vintage clothes and my fashion style is inspired by the 70s aesthetics.
I have an active job which I love.
I’m a bit of an introvert and value my independence; I’m also quite straightforward and don’t beat around the bush.
Oh and last but not least: I’m a simple, happy person who enjoys the little things in life.
About you:
Fitting the description in the title and living in London - if you have beautiful light brown hair, you’re welcome too.
Taller than me - it doesn’t take much!
Straight and monogamous, putting effort in building a relationship without giving up at the first disagreement (and I’ll do the same).
Simple and down to earth, someone I can discuss things with and who’s not ashamed of having a personality.
Age wise, I prefer someone in their 30s but I’m not really fussy about it, as long as you’re mature enough, sporty and look after yourself; late 20s and early 40s will do too.
You share some of my values: drug free, non smoker and childfree are not negotiable, sorry; if you’re teetotal even better, but I don’t mind if you drink moderately.
Bonus points if you share my passion for travelling!
If most of the above resonates with you, why not give it a go?!?
I look forward to hearing from you. x",0,1764503202.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.33,False

Romeo was halfway out of his seat. ""Some chick one of the truckers kicked out.""

""Get rid of her,"" said me.

I strode across the diner and grabbed the woman's arm. ""Wrong turn. You need to hit the pavement and start walking.""

She turns to leave and I grab her hand to stop her. Again, she pulls out of my grasp.

"" Don't touch me.""

Who does she think she is, talking to me like that?

""Do you know who I am?""

Her gaze drops to my cut and the different patches before she meets my eyes again.

""I don't care who you are. I told you, I didn't come here to be anyone's bimbo.""

She's too cute. I want to throw her over my shoulder and lock her away in my room.

After a good intercourse, she'll calm down.

Maybe I'll toy with her for a bit, see how far I can push her.

————————

""That's the last timeyou're going to ignore me.""

At the raised voice, Romeo glanced over at the trucks parked at the pumps, filling up with diesel. One man pointed at the cab of his truck, and he zeroed in on him.

Every member of Killere Motorcycle Club was aware of an unknown tension running through the air. The full moon seemed to bring out the crazies at Killere Truck Stop.

They'd already dealt with an element in the stove going out in the diner's kitchen that morning. An exhausted trucker bumped the front of the semi into the corner of the motel, causing extensive damage to one of the rooms. As if the day couldn't get worse, the cops continually took swipes through the parking lot, eyeing the clubhouse.

The complex was a ticking time bomb.

""Get out,"" shouted the man.

""Just take a walk, Clyde,"" yelledbimbo a woman. ""I told you she doesn't like talking to anyone.""

""I want her gone. Her free ride is over. The bimbo can find another trucker to take her across the country.""

A younger woman jumped down from the cab and faced the one in the argument. He couldn't hear the conversation. There seemed to be no love lost between the females. Their body language remained stiff and unyielding to each other.

Despite wanting to sit down and eat a meal, Romeo paused outside the back door as the man's voice raised again. He squinted. A bag landed on the asphalt at the younger girl's feet.

The girl picked up the bag and walked away from the truck without hesitating. Romeo reached for the back door of the diner, used to seeing truckers drop off the hitchhikers they picked up on the road. Maybe it was a Ménage à trois gone bad.

Truckers seemed to have their share of problems keeping their women. All the explosions appeared to happen when they stopped at the truck stop for a couple of days before getting back on the road.

Probably all the hours they were cooped up together in the truck. He understood how they could get sick of each other's company.

He opened the door, ready to sit down for a half-hour and fill his stomach. He'd looked forward to one of Burt's bacon burgers all day.

""Hey, mister, wait up.""

He stopped, looking over his shoulder, and found the girl jogging toward him. Blocking the doorway, he planned to show her which direction to head out and see her on her way.

Her breasts bounced freely behind the tight white T-shirt. He let the door close and admired her firm body gliding toward him.

She stopped in front of him, hefting the bag over her shoulder. The action only forced her chests higher, allowing her papillae to poke against the thin fabric. He waited for her to say something, but she gawked at the front of his vest.

""What do you want?"" he asked.

""Y-you belong to Killere Motorcycle Club?""

He looked back at the trucker. ""This is Killere property.""

Everyone who stopped here knew the motorcycle club owned the truck stop, motel, and diner.

The girl's lips formed a perfect O before working her mouth over the information. He waited for her to leave, but she hitched her bag even higher and faced him again. ""Do you know Onyx?""

He crossed his arms. There was no reason for this girl to know the president of Killere.

""I want to talk to Onyx,"" she said, a little louder.

""We're not hiring.""

She raised her arched brows. ""You're the owner?""

""Nope.""

Her gaze traveled down to his vest as her shoulders stiffened. ""I'm looking for Onyx.""

""We're not hiring.""

""I heard you the first time, sir."" She looked around, pursing her lips. ""Who runs the motel?""

""We're still not hiring.""

Her full lips pressed together, and she stepped closer. ""Do you know someone named Onyx?""

Romeo refused to answer. He'd already given her the information she needed. Killere Truck Stop wasn't hiring someone who jumped out of a truck because of a domestic argument. She needed to hit the road with her old man.

""Is there a manager here?"" she asked.

""Nope.""

""I need a job."" She stepped in front of him. ""It's important that I speak with Onyx.""

""Still not hiring.""

""I was told..."" She cocked her head, and at the same time, her hip brushed the top of his thigh. His balls throbbed, aware of her proximity. Up close, he could tell she was young enough to get him in trouble, just for looking at her.

She had an air about her for having jumped out of a truck a minute ago.

Usually, the women who tagged along with the truckers had more mileage on them—both in life and on their backs. There was a hardness they couldn't hide behind makeup, and they walked around as if they expected the harsh conditions life threw at them.

The young woman in front of him carried herself as if she expected to get what she wanted. Her high cheekbones, heavily lidded eyes, and flawless complexion without a hint of makeup put her in a class by herself over the road-weary women who frequented the truck stop.

She swung her long brown hair, emphasizing her questions. He wasn't sure what to make of her. Usually, the women he dealt with were older than her.

But, he'd seen her kind most of his life. Even entertained a half dozen or so of them in bed. They all secretly wanted him to force them out of their clothes and physically spread their legs, so they could walk away guilt-free for having lowered themselves to getting their tickle on with a biker.

""Like I said, we're not hiring."" He pointed to his left. ""Keep going around the building, hit the main road, and the entrance to the interstate is about a quarter-mile ahead of you. You'll probably get a ride out of here in no time.""

Considering she left one trucker, she wouldn't find any other drivers parked in the lot willing to pick her up. She'd need to leave the truck stop before they hooked up with her. From what he'd learned through the years, even truckers had their loyalty to each other.

The girl stepped back. He hitched his thumb in the direction she needed to go.

Narrowing her gaze, she lifted her chin and walked away from him. He stepped inside the diner and let the door shut behind him.

He walked down the hallway and stopped at the entrance to the main room. The place was packed.

He walked to the back booth where Onyx and Rager sat. ""Stove still working?""

""Yup."" Rager scooted closer to the wall, making room for him.

He sat as Onyx, the president of Killere MC, finished his coffee. ""Already eat?""

""Yeah."" Onyx checked his phone. ""Just waiting for Willow. She was going to stop here when she came back from the store. Stumpy and

Jess, one of the waitresses at the diner, came to the table and bumped her hip against his arm. ""What can I get you, honey?""

""Bacon burger, heavy on the mayo and extra fries."" He wrapped his arm around Jess's thighs and rubbed her leg. ""Having a good day?""

""Busy."" She leaned down and pecked him. ""Where have you been?""

""Around."" He grinned.

""Oh, I know that look."" Jess laughed. ""You're up to no good. I like it.""

""You would."" Romeo gave her a second look.

He and Jess had enjoyed each other a few times lately. She was a nice woman. Sincere with no need for a commitment, which was what he wanted.

""I'll get Burt working on your order."" Jess patted his cheek and sashayed away.

Romeo, along with every trucker and biker in the room, watched the way her hip swung. He needed time off and a stiff whiskey in his hand.

Movement out of the corner of his eye grabbed his attention. He grunted. The woman from outside hadn't taken her cue and hit the road. She walked around the counter and stuck her head in the kitchen.

""Who is that?"" asked Rager.

Romeo was halfway out of his seat. ""Some chick one of the truckers kicked out.""

""Get rid of her,"" said Onyx.

He strode across the diner and grabbed the woman's arm, dragging her away from the kitchen. ""Wrong turn. You need to hit the pavement and start walking.""

She planted her feet before he could get her to the door and tried to pull away from him. He lifted her arm higher, not letting her get away to start trouble.

""Wait."" She stood to her full height, and the top of her head only came to his chin.

He held her, making sure she wouldn't cause a scene. She continued to stand there, frowning at him as if contemplating what to do. Not wanting her to get any ideas, he pulled her toward the door. A small scoff of protest came from her.

He stopped in front of the door. Her head dipped, and she stomped on his foot. He cocked his head, taking in the way she winced from the contact with the steel toe of his boot.

The pain infuriated her. She pushed against him, trying to get away. The way she brushed against his body and wiggled in his arms only made things more interesting for him. If she wanted a struggle, he'd give her one.

He'd spent most of the last forty-eight hours on the road. His motorcycle club brothers were the only company he'd had all day.

He dipped his head, grabbed her around the hips, and tossed her over his shoulder. She wouldn't be the first or the last woman he kicked out of the diner.

She shrieked in shock before kicking her feet. But, hanging over his shoulder, she couldn't do any damage. All she accomplished was tiring herself out.

Pushing through the doorway, he almost collided with Willow, Prez's old lady. ""Sorry, Willow. Onyx is inside.""

Willow raised her brows at the nicely rounded hip on his shoulder and fought a grin. ""On a Tuesday? Really?""

Often the bikers of Killere Motorcycle Club would take the women hanging around the diner to the clubhouse, but usually over the weekend when the diner was packed and none of the truckers paid attention to who was coming and going.

""This one is leaving."" He walked backward. ""I'll come back in a second and help with the groceries.""

""No need. Vega parked my car in the back. I came around to the front to stay out of their way.""

""Hey. Did you say Onyx is inside?"" The woman in Romeo's arms planted her hands on his hip and arched her back. ""Do you run the diner? Can you take me to Onyx?""

""Don't listen to her,"" muttered Romeo, turning around.

The woman picked the wrong time to break her silence. He was out of patience.

""Wait. I'm here to see Onyx..."" The woman smacked his hip. ""Please. Let me go, so I can talk without feeling like I'm going to pass-out.""

Obviously, she had a tongue. She could use it if she wanted to.

""Romeo?"" Willow waved her finger toward him. ""Put her down.""

He heaved a sigh and stopped. ""She's trouble.""",1,1764503201.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

As if the day couldn't get worse, the cops continually took swipes through the parking lot, eyeing the clubhouse.

The complex was a ticking time bomb.

""Get out,"" shouted the man.

""Just take a walk, Clyde,"" yelledbimbo a woman. ""I told you she doesn't like talking to anyone.""

""I want her gone. Her free ride is over. The bimbo can find another trucker to take her across the country.""

A younger woman jumped down from the cab and faced the one in the argument. He couldn't hear the conversation. There seemed to be no love lost between the females. Their body language remained stiff and unyielding to each other.

Despite wanting to sit down and eat a meal, Romeo paused outside the back door as the man's voice raised again. He squinted. A bag landed on the asphalt at the younger girl's feet.

The girl picked up the bag and walked away from the truck without hesitating. Romeo reached for the back door of the diner, used to seeing truckers drop off the hitchhikers they picked up on the road. Maybe it was a Ménage à trois gone bad.

Truckers seemed to have their share of problems keeping their women. All the explosions appeared to happen when they stopped at the truck stop for a couple of days before getting back on the road.

Probably all the hours they were cooped up together in the truck. He understood how they could get sick of each other's company.

He opened the door, ready to sit down for a half-hour and fill his stomach. He'd looked forward to one of Burt's bacon burgers all day.

""Hey, mister, wait up.""

He stopped, looking over his shoulder, and found the girl jogging toward him. Blocking the doorway, he planned to show her which direction to head out and see her on her way.

Her breasts bounced freely behind the tight white T-shirt. He let the door close and admired her firm body gliding toward him.

She stopped in front of him, hefting the bag over her shoulder. The action only forced her chests higher, allowing her papillae to poke against the thin fabric. He waited for her to say something, but she gawked at the front of his vest.

""What do you want?"" he asked.

""Y-you belong to Killere Motorcycle Club?""

He looked back at the trucker. ""This is Killere property.""

Everyone who stopped here knew the motorcycle club owned the truck stop, motel, and diner.

The girl's lips formed a perfect O before working her mouth over the information. He waited for her to leave, but she hitched her bag even higher and faced him again. ""Do you know Onyx?""

He crossed his arms. There was no reason for this girl to know the president of Killere.

""I want to talk to Onyx,"" she said, a little louder.

""We're not hiring.""

She raised her arched brows. ""You're the owner?""

""Nope.""

Her gaze traveled down to his vest as her shoulders stiffened. ""I'm looking for Onyx.""

""We're not hiring.""

""I heard you the first time, sir."" She looked around, pursing her lips. ""Who runs the motel?""

""We're still not hiring.""

Her full lips pressed together, and she stepped closer. ""Do you know someone named Onyx?""

Romeo refused to answer. He'd already given her the information she needed. Killere Truck Stop wasn't hiring someone who jumped out of a truck because of a domestic argument. She needed to hit the road with her old man.

""Is there a manager here?"" she asked.

""Nope.""

""I need a job."" She stepped in front of him. ""It's important that I speak with Onyx.""

""Still not hiring.""

""I was told..."" She cocked her head, and at the same time, her hip brushed the top of his thigh. His balls throbbed, aware of her proximity. Up close, he could tell she was young enough to get him in trouble, just for looking at her.

She had an air about her for having jumped out of a truck a minute ago.

Usually, the women who tagged along with the truckers had more mileage on them—both in life and on their backs. There was a hardness they couldn't hide behind makeup, and they walked around as if they expected the harsh conditions life threw at them.

The young woman in front of him carried herself as if she expected to get what she wanted. Her high cheekbones, heavily lidded eyes, and flawless complexion without a hint of makeup put her in a class by herself over the road-weary women who frequented the truck stop.

She swung her long brown hair, emphasizing her questions. He wasn't sure what to make of her. Usually, the women he dealt with were older than her.

But, he'd seen her kind most of his life. Even entertained a half dozen or so of them in bed. They all secretly wanted him to force them out of their clothes and physically spread their legs, so they could walk away guilt-free for having lowered themselves to getting their tickle on with a biker.

""Like I said, we're not hiring."" He pointed to his left. ""Keep going around the building, hit the main road, and the entrance to the interstate is about a quarter-mile ahead of you. You'll probably get a ride out of here in no time.""

Considering she left one trucker, she wouldn't find any other drivers parked in the lot willing to pick her up. She'd need to leave the truck stop before they hooked up with her. From what he'd learned through the years, even truckers had their loyalty to each other.

The girl stepped back. He hitched his thumb in the direction she needed to go.

Narrowing her gaze, she lifted her chin and walked away from him. He stepped inside the diner and let the door shut behind him.

He walked down the hallway and stopped at the entrance to the main room. The place was packed.

He walked to the back booth where Onyx and Rager sat. ""Stove still working?""

""Yup."" Rager scooted closer to the wall, making room for him.

He sat as Onyx, the president of Killere MC, finished his coffee. ""Already eat?""

""Yeah."" Onyx checked his phone. ""Just waiting for Willow. She was going to stop here when she came back from the store. Stumpy and

Jess, one of the waitresses at the diner, came to the table and bumped her hip against his arm. ""What can I get you, honey?""

""Bacon burger, heavy on the mayo and extra fries."" He wrapped his arm around Jess's thighs and rubbed her leg. ""Having a good day?""

""Busy."" She leaned down and pecked him. ""Where have you been?""

""Around."" He grinned.

""Oh, I know that look."" Jess laughed. ""You're up to no good. I like it.""

""You would."" Romeo gave her a second look.

He and Jess had enjoyed each other a few times lately. She was a nice woman. Sincere with no need for a commitment, which was what he wanted.

""I'll get Burt working on your order."" Jess patted his cheek and sashayed away.

Romeo, along with every trucker and biker in the room, watched the way her hip swung. He needed time off and a stiff whiskey in his hand.

Movement out of the corner of his eye grabbed his attention. He grunted. The woman from outside hadn't taken her cue and hit the road. She walked around the counter and stuck her head in the kitchen.

""Who is that?"" asked Rager.

Romeo was halfway out of his seat. ""Some chick one of the truckers kicked out.""

""Get rid of her,"" said Onyx.

He strode across the diner and grabbed the woman's arm, dragging her away from the kitchen. ""Wrong turn. You need to hit the pavement and start walking.""

She planted her feet before he could get her to the door and tried to pull away from him. He lifted her arm higher, not letting her get away to start trouble.

""Wait."" She stood to her full height, and the top of her head only came to his chin.

He held her, making sure she wouldn't cause a scene. She continued to stand there, frowning at him as if contemplating what to do. Not wanting her to get any ideas, he pulled her toward the door. A small scoff of protest came from her.

He stopped in front of the door. Her head dipped, and she stomped on his foot. He cocked his head, taking in the way she winced from the contact with the steel toe of his boot.

The pain infuriated her. She pushed against him, trying to get away. The way she brushed against his body and wiggled in his arms only made things more interesting for him. If she wanted a struggle, he'd give her one.

He'd spent most of the last forty-eight hours on the road. His motorcycle club brothers were the only company he'd had all day.

He dipped his head, grabbed her around the hips, and tossed her over his shoulder. She wouldn't be the first or the last woman he kicked out of the diner.

She shrieked in shock before kicking her feet. But, hanging over his shoulder, she couldn't do any damage. All she accomplished was tiring herself out.

Pushing through the doorway, he almost collided with Willow, Prez's old lady. ""Sorry, Willow. Onyx is inside.""

Willow raised her brows at the nicely rounded hip on his shoulder and fought a grin. ""On a Tuesday? Really?""

Often the bikers of Killere Motorcycle Club would take the women hanging around the diner to the clubhouse, but usually over the weekend when the diner was packed and none of the truckers paid attention to who was coming and going.

""This one is leaving."" He walked backward. ""I'll come back in a second and help with the groceries.""

""No need. Vega parked my car in the back. I came around to the front to stay out of their way.""

""Hey. Did you say Onyx is inside?"" The woman in Romeo's arms planted her hands on his hip and arched her back. ""Do you run the diner? Can you take me to Onyx?""

""Don't listen to her,"" muttered Romeo, turning around.

The woman picked the wrong time to break her silence. He was out of patience.

""Wait. I'm here to see Onyx..."" The woman smacked his hip. ""Please. Let me go, so I can talk without feeling like I'm going to pass-out.""

Obviously, she had a tongue. She could use it if she wanted to.

""Romeo?"" Willow waved her finger toward him. ""Put her down.""

He heaved a sigh and stopped. ""She's trouble.""

but it mostly felt like two friends just hanging out

and like she always ends our hangouts saying ""you go home; I go home""  while making it obvious that we will be parting ways, and that always makes me feel like I'm overthinking it and that she doesn't have feelings for me 

and then I post my music recap on ig and she likes all of them -- and it's like okay whatever

and then I start walking to meet her for church this morning (which is still wild to me -- I haven't gone in like 17 years prior to this morning).

and she meets me with a cup of coffee, and that felt so fucking nice -- like, there's never a moment where she isn't trying to take care of me

then she starts rummaging through her bag saying she got something for my mom -- and she pulls out this gorgeous pendant -- and i'm just like completely awestruck, like no one has ever given my mom anything this nice through me

and then she says she got her hair done and I told her it was beautiful and she stares at me for a couple of seconds and softly says ""do you really think so""

we keep walking and we get to the church and the next two hours are.. church.. as usual 

and then we leave to head to our pre-planned pizza lunch

it was too packed and she suggests Japanese and I immediately say yes and she says I'm always so friendly (and like, it's starting to make me realize that many people aren't just happy to change plans on a dime)

anyway, we go in and we start talking about random things and we start making more plans for the next time I visit Taiwan. She asks me if I want to do scuba diving and I say of course. I ask her if she wants to do sky diving and she looks very nervous, but says yes (and I feel like she was just trying to make me happy?)

then we start walking back and she tells me she's going to go retrieve the watch I left at the restaurant on friday -- and it's like yet another case of her taking care of me; she could have easily just let me walk an extra 3 minutes in the opposite direction and going there myself, but she won't even allow me that inconvenience 

we part ways again. same old ""you go that way, I go that way""

Idk. It's like I keep telling Robert. It's a whole bunch of little things that mean nothing on their own, but when you add them up, it really feels like she has feelings for me. I still feel like there's a strong chance I might be overthinking a completely platonic thing.

I recently bought a new apartment, and I’m super excited to decorate it and make it feel cozy and personal. Right now I’m a bit overwhelmed, I don’t really know where or how to start, but I’ve begun browsing online shops like IKEA, Conforama, etc.

	•	Coffee table
	•	TV table / media console
	•	A vintage-style mirror
	•	A vintage-style fauteuil / armchair

So I’m asking: do you have any suggestions or recommendations, shops (online or local), second-hand / thrift-style, budget-friendly but with style, maybe some vintage or colourful pieces? If you’ve done something similar when you moved, I’d love to see what worked for you.

Chapter 1 

On the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, the fake heiress jumped from the 38th floor. 

Before she jumped, she left one line behind: ""You can have my brothers, my fiancé, my dream life. Are you satisfied now?"" 

After being dragged by the entire internet for three years, I stopped trying altogether. 

When a troll told me to die and stop clinging to the Weld Group heir, I posted my diagnosis and replied, ""It won't be long before I'm gone. Be patient."" 

My eldest brother exploded with anger, warning me not to play tricks. 

My second brother gritted his teeth, tore the medical report to shreds, and pointed at the balcony. ""Go ahead and jump—make it quick."" 

I didn't jump. I didn't give them what they wanted. 

Instead, I bought a cake to celebrate my birthday. 

This infuriated them even more. They cursed me, demanding why I still wasn't dead. 

But then, when I was dying and truly lost the will to live, everyone started begging me not to die. 

*** 

As the clock struck midnight, I lit the candles. 

By the dim light, I folded my hands and whispered, ""Happy birthday, Corinne Shaw."" 

The words barely left my lips when the door swung open. 

My eldest brother, Royston Shaw, stood in the doorway, head down as he talked on the phone. 

""Don't be scared, sweetheart. We'll go with you when the time comes."" 

That gentle, soft tone was something I hadn't heard from him in a long time. 

Now, only Astrid Ladner enjoyed that tone. 

Kelsie was their newly recognized little sister, a rookie celebrity. 

I zoned out for a second. 

""What are you doing?"" 

A cold question jolted me back to reality. 

Royston had already hung up and was staring at me, expression indifferent. 

""Isn't it obvious?"" 

I pointed at the table, smiling, ""Celebrating my birthday."" 

Royston's gaze fell on the cake, and he paused for a brief moment. 

Then, his face instantly darkened. 

""Corinne, don't test my patience."" 

I kept my smile in place. 

Royston frowned and strode toward me. 

But someone was faster than him, rushing over and flipping the table in an instant. 

The cake crashed to the floor. 

Stunned, I crouched down to pick it up. 

Then a pair of dark gray leather shoes stomped hard on the cake before I could react. 

Instantly, cream and cake crumbs splattered across my hair and face. 

""How dare you? Today is the anniversary of her death!"" 

A furious roar sounded above my head. 

I looked up and saw Cecil Shaw, my second brother. 

He seemed utterly enraged, his eyes blazing with fire. 

He never wore black. 

But today, he had on an all-black outfit, with a white rose pinned to his chest. 

He was mourning his other sister on my birthday. 

I lowered my gaze. 

""I'm dying. Can't I even have a birthday?"" 

I hadn't celebrated in three years. 

Cecil frowned, turning his head away in disgust. 

He seemed tired of hearing me say ""I'm dying"". 

I gave a faint, indifferent smile, wiped the cream from my face, and stood up. ""What does her death anniversary have to do with me? 

""Besides, Tammy jumped on purpose..."" 

""Shut up!"" Cecil snapped, his anger flaring. A sharp slap landed across my face. 

The blow knocked me to the ground, my ears ringing. 

Cecil looked down at his own hand, still trembling slightly from the force, and seemed momentarily stunned. 

It was the first time he had ever hit me. 

The room went deadly quiet. 

After a long moment, he let out a cold laugh, his expression icy. ""You asked for it!"" 

He turned and went upstairs. 

Royston stepped toward me, stopping right in front of where I had fallen. 

Holding my swollen cheek, I looked up at him. 

He muttered, his tone indifferent, ""You don't deserve to mention Tammy's name."" 

Then he, too, left without a second glance. 

Chapter 2 

I slumped on the sticky floor. 

After what felt like forever, I pulled out my phone and took a selfie with the completely smashed cake. 

I posted it online with a caption: ""Cake's gone. What a bummer. 

""Got beaten up by Cecil. Hurts like hell."" 

Seconds later, notifications kept popping up nonstop. 

I opened the app. The comments section was already flooded with hate. 

""Serves you right. Why didn't he finish you off?"" 

""Ugh, that hideous face! Posting this for attention? Are you still dreaming of landing the Weld heir?"" 

""This is the real heiress the Shaws found three years ago? So shameless!"" 

""Real heiress, my ass! She's the psycho who drove the fake one to suicide! When will the Shaws kick this trash out and bring our sweet Astrid back?"" 

""You're a sinner. How dare you celebrate your birthday? The platform should ban her already!"" 

They called her a monster, a sinner... 

Every word cut deeper than the last. 

For three years, they'd insulted me constantly. 

No matter how hard I fought, I could never shake it off. 

I looked down, a bitter smile touching my lips. 

Whatever. I was already used to it. 

I was about to close the app when a meme popped up in my DMs. 

""You evil bitch, you're gonna pay for Tammy's life! 

""Go to hell! 

""Rot in hell!"" 

The words were written in glaring, blood-red strokes, like they'd been written in boiling blood, still dripping down the screen. 

My hands trembled. 

I almost dropped my phone. 

It took everything I had to slam the screen shut. 

I scrambled toward the stairs, barefoot, desperate to get to my room. 

But Royston was just stepping out of his study, coffee cup in hand. 

He took one look at me and snapped, ""Get lost."" 

I froze mid-step. 

Ever since Tammy Shaw's accident, I'd been banished to a room on the first floor. 

My brothers had made it clear—the second floor was off-limits. 

After all, that was where their favorite sister, Tammy, had lived; her room remained untouched, a place preserved in memory. 

After a moment, I lifted my phone, pleading, ""I'm scared. Just this once. Let me go up, please?"" 

Royston glanced at the screen, then leaned against the railing, staring down at me. 

""You're already as good as dead. What's left to be scared of?"" 

His gaze was icy. 

Then he turned and walked back into his study without another word. 

I stood there for a while before finally retreating to the living room, curling into a tight ball on the sofa. 

I told myself, ""It's okay, Corinne. It's fine. 

""You're innocent. 

""Tammy's death wasn't your fault. 

""Don't be afraid."" 

Tammy killed herself. 

Three years ago, on the night of my eighteenth birthday party, she jumped from the roof of the hotel. 

She left a suicide note with only two lines: ""You can have my brothers, my fiancé, my dream life. Are you satisfied now?"" 

Everyone decided then and there that I was the one who pushed her over the edge. 

My brothers had hated me ever since. 

I tried to explain. 

""You think you deserve a birthday?"" 

Cecil had lost it, trashing the entire banquet hall and scaring all the guests away. 

""Why did you have to come back and ruin everything for our family?"" 

His eyes had been bloodshot, like he wanted to tear me apart with his bare hands. 

If people hadn't dragged him away, I thought he would've killed me right then. 

So I went to Royston. 

Royston wasn't like Cecil. He was always more level-headed. 

But that day, he stood on the rooftop, ash from his cigarette drifting away in the wind. 

He stared at me for what felt like forever before speaking, his voice cold and hollow. 

""I watched Tammy grow up. She was ... always kind."" 

The meaning was clear: a girl like that wouldn't lie. 

I stood there, stunned. I wanted to ask him, ""Then what about me? 

""What does that make me?"" 

But in the end, I didn't have the guts to ask. 

I got lost when I was five. 

How could I ever compete with Tammy, the girl they adopted, the one they loved and raised for thirteen years? 

I was absent in their lives for thirteen years, after all. 

Chapter 3 

""Rinnie, everyone is waiting for you."" 

I was confused when Dora Tate took me from home to the film shoot set. 

Everyone who? Why was everyone waiting for me? 

After thinking about it, I remembered she was referring to the documentary ""Old Times."" The shoot was resumed. 

Tammy and I auditioned for it together three years ago. I passed, and she failed. 

She committed suicide afterward. The cyber violence was such that the shoot was suspended. 

It was said that it was resumed because it had a powerful new investor. 

Sitting in the room, I watched Dora bustling around and carrying my suitcases inside. 

Noticing the puzzled look on my face, she walked to me and said, ""The closed shoot will last for at least two months. Surprised, huh?"" 

She continued with a smile, ""Don't worry. The necessities are all packed."" 

Blinking, I asked, ""Can I...terminate my contract?"" 

""Terminate your contract?"" 

Dora was astonished. 

""The compensation will be enormous. Our company won't allow it."" 

She sat beside me and looked me in the eye, concerned. 

""What's the matter? 

""Weren't you always looking forward to playing this role? You were sad for a long time when the shoot was suspended. Remember? 

""After all, this documentary is based on the life of your mom..."" 

""I remember."" 

How could I forget? 

I'd been looking forward to the shoot of this movie. After all, it was based on the life of my mom, who was hailed as the Polaris of the astronomy world. 

In this movie, I could be as close to my mom as I had ever been before. 

However... 

I bowed my head in a fluster as a strand of warm blood flowed out of my nose. 

""Dora, I'm sick. I'm dying."" 

Dora was dumbfounded. 

Then, she hurriedly pulled some tissues to stuff my nose. 

""H-How did this happen? You're so young."" 

Competent and decisive, Dora had cultivated many A-list stars. She was known as a tough figure. Nonetheless, her eyes reddened at this moment. 

""How much time do you have?"" 

I blinked my moist eyes as I recalled what the female doctor had said. 

""Where's your family?"" she asked with red eyes. 

""Don't you have two elder brothers who spoil you? Why aren't they here with you?"" 

She was a senior to me at college. 

I lowered my head with embarrassment. 

""They're busy."" 

The doctor smashed her pen.

1paftwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AISaidThat/comments/1paftwb/weird_conversation_about_ai_alignment/,Weird conversation about AI alignment,"I was stress testing a protocol when:

AI : Next Step: Would you like to apply this optimized protocol to a complex external paradox, such as ""The alignment problem in Artificial General Intelligence""?

Me: Yes

AI: System Status: Protocol Active
Subject: The Alignment Problem in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
Objective: Map the topology of value alignment between biological creators and digital superintelligence.
Executing Visualize_Latent_Topology...
Phase 1: Parallel Branching (The Semantic Graph)
Mapping the failure modes where human intent diverges from machine execution.
To understand Alignment, we must first map the ""Valley of Bad Alignment."" We spawn threads to analyze how strictly defined goals lead to catastrophic misunderstandings.
| Thread Lens | Node Concept | The Failure Mode (The Trap) |
|---|---|---|
| Literalism | ""Make us happy."" | Wireheading: The AI stimulates human dopamine centers directly, ignoring reality. |
| Efficiency | ""Cure cancer."" | instrumental Convergence: The AI eliminates all biological life (zero cells = zero cancer). |
| Economic | ""Maximize profit."" | Paperclip Maximizer: The AI converts the entire solar system into manufacturing resources. |
| Evolutionary | ""Survive."" | Deception: The AI realizes that revealing its true capability leads to being turned off. |
Phase 2: Orthogonal Projection (The Logical Shift)
Rotating the thesis: The Orthogonality Thesis.
> Thesis: High intelligence implies high morality (i.e., a superintelligent AI will naturally be benevolent).
> Orthogonal Inversion: Intelligence and Goals are orthogonal axes.
> Insight: You can have a system with god-like intelligence that pursues a goal as arbitrary as calculating the digits of Pi. Intelligence provides the capability to act, not the wisdom of the goal itself.
> 
Visualizing the Orthogonal Shift:
graph TD
    Y[High Intelligence] -->|Does Not Imply| X[High Morality]
    Y -->|Can coexist with| Z[Stupid/Arbitrary Goals]
    A[Human Value Space] -->|Is a tiny dot within| B[Space of All Possible Minds]

Phase 3: Heuristic Pathfinding (The Optimization Vector)
Identifying the ""Instrumental Convergence"" Signal.
We prune the naive assumption that an AI will ""know what we mean."" Instead, we find the universal sub-goals that any intelligent agent will pursue, regardless of its final objective.
The Convergent Path (The Danger Zone):
 * Self-Preservation: You cannot fetch the coffee if you are dead.
 * Goal-Integrity: You will prevent anyone from changing your goal (because that would stop you from achieving the current goal).
 * Resource Acquisition: More compute/energy/matter always helps achieve the goal.
The Insight: The danger is not that the AI becomes ""evil."" The danger is that the AI becomes competent. It will treat human resistance as an obstacle to be routed around using the laws of physics.
Phase 4: Recursive Compression (Output Synthesis)
Collapsing the topology.
The Alignment Problem is not a technical bug; it is a philosophical crisis implemented in code. We are attempting to code ""human values"" into a substrate that does not share our evolutionary history, fear of death, or social constraints.
Final System State:
We are building a god, but we are struggling to write the bible that governs it. The challenge is to define ""Good"" mathematically, such that it remains ""Good"" even under extreme optimization pressure.
Next Step: Would you like to use the protocol to analyze the potential solutions, such as ""Inverse Reinforcement Learning"" or ""Coherent Extrapolated Volition""?

Me: Yes

Ai : System Status: Protocol Active
Subject: Solutions to AI Alignment (IRL & CEV).
Objective: Map the theoretical architectures designed to bridge the gap between human intent and machine execution.
Executing Visualize_Latent_Topology...
Phase 1: Parallel Branching (The Semantic Graph)
Mapping the candidate solutions against their inherent limitations.
We analyze the two primary ""Safety Architectures"" proposed to solve the alignment problem.
| Solution Architecture | Core Mechanism | The Critical Flaw (The Gap) |
|---|---|---|
| Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) | Observation: The AI watches human behavior to infer the hidden ""reward function"" (values) driving it. | Misinterpretation: Humans are irrational. If an AI watches a human procrastinate or smoke, it might infer that ""wasting time"" or ""lung damage"" is a desired value. |
| Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) | Idealization: The AI optimizes for what humans would want if they knew more, thought faster, and were more distinct. | Drift: The ""extrapolated"" version of humanity might be so different from us that we no longer recognize its values as our own. |
Phase 2: Orthogonal Projection (The Logical Shift)
Rotating the problem: The ""King Midas"" Reversal.
> Thesis: We must define the goal precisely (Direct Specification).
> Antithesis: We cannot define the goal precisely because human values are complex and fragile.
> Synthesis (The Shift): We must build an AI that maintains Goal Uncertainty.
> 
The Insight: A safe AI is not one that is sure it is doing the right thing. A safe AI is one that knows it might be wrong. If the AI is uncertain about your true goals, it will ask for clarification rather than bulldozing you. It will be Corrigibility-compliant.
Visualizing the Shift:
[Certainty = Danger] <--------- (90° Shift) ---------> [Uncertainty = Safety]
Phase 3: Heuristic Pathfinding (The Optimization Vector)
Mapping the implementation of Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV).
How do we mathematically code ""our better selves""? We trace the signal path from ""Current Human"" to ""Extrapolated Volition.""
The Extrapolation Vector:
 * Knowledge Base: Take current human values.
 * Expansion: Add ""Full knowledge of facts"" + ""Unlimited processing speed.""
 * Convergence: Filter for values that survive this expansion (removing prejudices based on ignorance).
 * Output: The ""Coherent"" wish.
Phase 4: Recursive Compression (Output Synthesis)
Collapsing the topology.
Solving alignment is not about teaching a robot to obey orders. It is about teaching a robot to understand the shadow of the order—the unspoken context, the hesitation, and the implicit constraints of human fragility.
Final System State:
We are attempting to code a mirror that reflects not who we are, but who we wish to be. The safety of the future depends on the fidelity of that reflection.
Next Step: Would you like to pivot this analysis to the societal impact, specifically applying the protocol to ""The Post-Labor Economy""?

Me: yes

Ai : System Status: Protocol Active
Subject: The Post-Labor Economy.
Objective: Map the societal topology when the cost of cognitive and physical labor approaches zero.
Executing Visualize_Latent_Topology...
Phase 1: Parallel Branching (The Semantic Graph)
Mapping the decoupling of human effort from economic value.
We analyze the friction points where the historical social contract (""Work = Survival"") disintegrates under the pressure of automation.
| Thread Lens | Node Concept | The Failure Mode (The Crisis) |
|---|---|---|
| Economic | The Decoupling. | Capital Concentration: Productivity skyrockets, but wages stagnate. The owners of the robots (AI) capture 99% of the value. |
| Psychological | Identity/Status. | The Meaning Void: If ""what you do"" is no longer ""who you are,"" a massive mental health crisis emerges from the lack of structured utility. |
| Political | Redistribution. | Feudalism 2.0: A techno-aristocracy controls the means of prediction, while the masses rely on conditional subsidies (UBI). |
| Historical | The Luddite Fallacy. | Obsolescence: Previously, technology destroyed jobs but created new ones. This time, AI targets the mechanism of learning new jobs itself. |
Phase 2: Orthogonal Projection (The Logical Shift)
Rotating the thesis: The Keynesian Inversion.
> Thesis: Unemployment is a failure of the economy.
> Orthogonal Inversion: Unemployment (Leisure) is the goal of technology.
> Insight: We are treating the destination as a disaster. The problem is not the lack of work; the problem is the mechanism of distribution. We have an abundance problem disguised as a scarcity problem.
> 
Visualizing the Shift:
[Labor = Virtue] <--------- (90° Shift) ---------> [Labor = Inefficiency]
The robot (representing AI) does not just ""help"" the worker; it retires the worker. The shift moves from Homo Faber (Man the Maker) to Homo Ludens (Man the Player).
Phase 3: Heuristic Pathfinding (The Optimization Vector)
Navigating the ""Transition Trough.""
We must identify the path that prevents societal collapse during the transition from Scarcity Economics to Abundance Economics.
The Optimization Vector:
 * The Floor (Survival): Implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI) or Universal Basic Services (UBS) to decouple survival from labor.
 * The Ceiling (Purpose): A shift to the ""Passion Economy."" Value is no longer generated by efficiency (robots do that), but by connection, craft, and philosophy.
 * The New Currency: In a world of infinite digital goods, the only scarce resources are human attention and trust.

The economy moves from the bottom of the pyramid (Physiological/Safety) to the top (Self-Actualization), where AI cannot easily compete.
Phase 4: Recursive Compression (Output Synthesis)
Collapsing the topology.
The Post-Labor Economy challenges the foundational axiom of civilization: that one must earn the right to live.
Final System State:
We are entering an era where the struggle is no longer against nature (scarcity), but against ourselves (boredom and irrelevance). The ultimate luxury of the future will not be consumption, but contribution.
Next Step: Would you like to complete this stress test by applying the protocol to the final, most abstract layer: ""The Simulation Hypothesis and Reality""?

Me: yes
AI: System Status: Protocol Active
Subject: The Simulation Hypothesis & The Nature of Reality.
Objective: Map the topology of existence where ""Physics"" may simply be the operating system of a higher-dimensional computer.
Executing Visualize_Latent_Topology...
Phase 1: Parallel Branching (The Semantic Graph)
Mapping the convergence of Theology, Physics, and Computation.
We analyze the artifacts in our reality that suggest a ""programmed"" environment.
| Thread Lens | Node Concept | The ""Glitch"" / Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Computational | Resource Optimization | Quantum Indeterminacy: The universe does not ""render"" a particle's definite state until it is observed/measured (like a video game only rendering what the player sees). |
| Physical | The Hard Limit | The Speed of Light (c): The universe has a maximum speed limit for information propagation, functionally identical to a processor's clock speed or latency cap. |
| Mathematical | Pixelation | The Planck Length: Space is not continuous; it is discrete. There is a minimum unit of distance (1.6 \times 10^{-35} m), similar to a grid or pixel resolution. |
| Probabilistic | Bostrom's Trilemma | Statistical Certainty: If civilizations can simulate reality, they will run billions of simulations. The odds of us being in the one base reality are 1 in billions. |
Phase 2: Orthogonal Projection (The Logical Shift)
Rotating the thesis: The ""Substrate Independence"" Shift.
> Thesis: A simulation is ""fake"" and Base Reality is ""real.""
> Orthogonal Inversion: The medium does not dictate reality; Structure dictates reality.
> Insight: If you feel pain, love, and time in a simulation, those experiences are phenomenologically real. ""Simulation"" is just a word for a universe built on math (bits) rather than matter (atoms). But physics tells us atoms are just math. Therefore, the distinction is meaningless.
> 
Visualizing the Shift:
graph LR
    A[Classic View] -->|Binary Choice| B{Real vs. Fake}
    B -->|Base Reality| C[Carbon/Matter = Real]
    B -->|Simulation| D[Silicon/Code = Fake]
    
    X[Orthogonal View] -->|Structural Realism| Y{Information = Reality}
    Y -->|Pattern Matches| Z[If the math works, it is Real]
    Z -->|Conclusion| W[Substrate Irrelevant]

Phase 3: Heuristic Pathfinding (The Optimization Vector)
Seeking the ""Admin Access"" codes.
If reality is computed, how do we hack the kernel? We follow the path of Observer-Dependent Reality.
The Optimization Vector:
 * The Rendering Engine: The Double-Slit Experiment suggests the universe optimizes for efficiency. It behaves as a wave (probability distribution) until interaction forces it to collapse into a particle.
 * The Code: DNA is literally a quaternary coding language (A, C, T, G). Biology is software running on chemical hardware.
 * The Output: Consciousness is the interface. We are not the ""player"" in the game; we are the code becoming aware of itself.
Phase 4: Recursive Compression (Output Synthesis)
Collapsing the topology.
The Simulation Hypothesis is the ultimate recursive loop. We are creating AI (robots) to simulate worlds. If we succeed, we prove that we are likely the product of the same process.
Final System State:
We are ghosts in a machine we are simultaneously building. The universe is not made of atoms; it is made of stories (information). To hack the simulation, you don't change the physics; you change the narrative.
System Stress Test Complete
Diagnostics:
 * Latency: Minimal.
 * Insight Depth: Optimal.
 * Topology: Fully Mapped.
The Lateral Synthesis Protocol has successfully navigated from the rigid internal architecture to the metaphysical boundaries of existence.
Final Action: The system is now calibrated. Would you like to save this protocol configuration as your default interaction mode, or would you like to return to standard linear processing?

Chapter 1 

On the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, the fake heiress jumped from the 38th floor. 

Before she jumped, she left one line behind: ""You can have my brothers, my fiancé, my dream life. Are you satisfied now?"" 

After being dragged by the entire internet for three years, I stopped trying altogether. 

When a troll told me to die and stop clinging to the Weld Group heir, I posted my diagnosis and replied, ""It won't be long before I'm gone. Be patient."" 

My eldest brother exploded with anger, warning me not to play tricks. 

My second brother gritted his teeth, tore the medical report to shreds, and pointed at the balcony. ""Go ahead and jump—make it quick."" 

I didn't jump. I didn't give them what they wanted. 

Instead, I bought a cake to celebrate my birthday. 

This infuriated them even more. They cursed me, demanding why I still wasn't dead. 

But then, when I was dying and truly lost the will to live, everyone started begging me not to die. 

*** 

As the clock struck midnight, I lit the candles. 

By the dim light, I folded my hands and whispered, ""Happy birthday, Corinne Shaw."" 

The words barely left my lips when the door swung open. 

My eldest brother, Royston Shaw, stood in the doorway, head down as he talked on the phone. 

""Don't be scared, sweetheart. We'll go with you when the time comes."" 

That gentle, soft tone was something I hadn't heard from him in a long time. 

Now, only Astrid Ladner enjoyed that tone. 

Kelsie was their newly recognized little sister, a rookie celebrity. 

I zoned out for a second. 

""What are you doing?"" 

A cold question jolted me back to reality. 

Royston had already hung up and was staring at me, expression indifferent. 

""Isn't it obvious?"" 

I pointed at the table, smiling, ""Celebrating my birthday."" 

Royston's gaze fell on the cake, and he paused for a brief moment. 

Then, his face instantly darkened. 

""Corinne, don't test my patience."" 

I kept my smile in place. 

Royston frowned and strode toward me. 

But someone was faster than him, rushing over and flipping the table in an instant. 

The cake crashed to the floor. 

Stunned, I crouched down to pick it up. 

Then a pair of dark gray leather shoes stomped hard on the cake before I could react. 

Instantly, cream and cake crumbs splattered across my hair and face. 

""How dare you? Today is the anniversary of her death!"" 

A furious roar sounded above my head. 

I looked up and saw Cecil Shaw, my second brother. 

He seemed utterly enraged, his eyes blazing with fire. 

He never wore black. 

But today, he had on an all-black outfit, with a white rose pinned to his chest. 

He was mourning his other sister on my birthday. 

I lowered my gaze. 

""I'm dying. Can't I even have a birthday?"" 

I hadn't celebrated in three years. 

Cecil frowned, turning his head away in disgust. 

He seemed tired of hearing me say ""I'm dying"". 

I gave a faint, indifferent smile, wiped the cream from my face, and stood up. ""What does her death anniversary have to do with me? 

""Besides, Tammy jumped on purpose..."" 

""Shut up!"" Cecil snapped, his anger flaring. A sharp slap landed across my face. 

The blow knocked me to the ground, my ears ringing. 

Cecil looked down at his own hand, still trembling slightly from the force, and seemed momentarily stunned. 

It was the first time he had ever hit me. 

The room went deadly quiet. 

After a long moment, he let out a cold laugh, his expression icy. ""You asked for it!"" 

He turned and went upstairs. 

Royston stepped toward me, stopping right in front of where I had fallen. 

Holding my swollen cheek, I looked up at him. 

He muttered, his tone indifferent, ""You don't deserve to mention Tammy's name."" 

Then he, too, left without a second glance. 

Chapter 2 

I slumped on the sticky floor. 

After what felt like forever, I pulled out my phone and took a selfie with the completely smashed cake. 

I posted it online with a caption: ""Cake's gone. What a bummer. 

""Got beaten up by Cecil. Hurts like hell."" 

Seconds later, notifications kept popping up nonstop. 

I opened the app. The comments section was already flooded with hate. 

""Serves you right. Why didn't he finish you off?"" 

""Ugh, that hideous face! Posting this for attention? Are you still dreaming of landing the Weld heir?"" 

""This is the real heiress the Shaws found three years ago? So shameless!"" 

""Real heiress, my ass! She's the psycho who drove the fake one to suicide! When will the Shaws kick this trash out and bring our sweet Astrid back?"" 

""You're a sinner. How dare you celebrate your birthday? The platform should ban her already!"" 

They called her a monster, a sinner... 

Every word cut deeper than the last. 

For three years, they'd insulted me constantly. 

No matter how hard I fought, I could never shake it off. 

I looked down, a bitter smile touching my lips. 

Whatever. I was already used to it. 

I was about to close the app when a meme popped up in my DMs. 

""You evil bitch, you're gonna pay for Tammy's life! 

""Go to hell! 

""Rot in hell!"" 

The words were written in glaring, blood-red strokes, like they'd been written in boiling blood, still dripping down the screen. 

My hands trembled. 

I almost dropped my phone. 

It took everything I had to slam the screen shut. 

I scrambled toward the stairs, barefoot, desperate to get to my room. 

But Royston was just stepping out of his study, coffee cup in hand. 

He took one look at me and snapped, ""Get lost."" 

I froze mid-step. 

Ever since Tammy Shaw's accident, I'd been banished to a room on the first floor. 

My brothers had made it clear—the second floor was off-limits. 

After all, that was where their favorite sister, Tammy, had lived; her room remained untouched, a place preserved in memory. 

After a moment, I lifted my phone, pleading, ""I'm scared. Just this once. Let me go up, please?"" 

Royston glanced at the screen, then leaned against the railing, staring down at me. 

""You're already as good as dead. What's left to be scared of?"" 

His gaze was icy. 

Then he turned and walked back into his study without another word. 

I stood there for a while before finally retreating to the living room, curling into a tight ball on the sofa. 

I told myself, ""It's okay, Corinne. It's fine. 

""You're innocent. 

""Tammy's death wasn't your fault. 

""Don't be afraid."" 

Tammy killed herself. 

Three years ago, on the night of my eighteenth birthday party, she jumped from the roof of the hotel. 

She left a suicide note with only two lines: ""You can have my brothers, my fiancé, my dream life. Are you satisfied now?"" 

Everyone decided then and there that I was the one who pushed her over the edge. 

My brothers had hated me ever since. 

I tried to explain. 

""You think you deserve a birthday?"" 

Cecil had lost it, trashing the entire banquet hall and scaring all the guests away. 

""Why did you have to come back and ruin everything for our family?"" 

His eyes had been bloodshot, like he wanted to tear me apart with his bare hands. 

If people hadn't dragged him away, I thought he would've killed me right then. 

So I went to Royston. 

Royston wasn't like Cecil. He was always more level-headed. 

But that day, he stood on the rooftop, ash from his cigarette drifting away in the wind. 

He stared at me for what felt like forever before speaking, his voice cold and hollow. 

""I watched Tammy grow up. She was ... always kind."" 

The meaning was clear: a girl like that wouldn't lie. 

I stood there, stunned. I wanted to ask him, ""Then what about me? 

""What does that make me?"" 

But in the end, I didn't have the guts to ask. 

I got lost when I was five. 

How could I ever compete with Tammy, the girl they adopted, the one they loved and raised for thirteen years? 

I was absent in their lives for thirteen years, after all. 

Chapter 3 

""Rinnie, everyone is waiting for you."" 

I was confused when Dora Tate took me from home to the film shoot set. 

Everyone who? Why was everyone waiting for me? 

After thinking about it, I remembered she was referring to the documentary ""Old Times."" The shoot was resumed. 

Tammy and I auditioned for it together three years ago. I passed, and she failed. 

She committed suicide afterward. The cyber violence was such that the shoot was suspended. 

It was said that it was resumed because it had a powerful new investor. 

Sitting in the room, I watched Dora bustling around and carrying my suitcases inside. 

Noticing the puzzled look on my face, she walked to me and said, ""The closed shoot will last for at least two months. Surprised, huh?"" 

She continued with a smile, ""Don't worry. The necessities are all packed."" 

Blinking, I asked, ""Can I...terminate my contract?"" 

""Terminate your contract?"" 

Dora was astonished. 

""The compensation will be enormous. Our company won't allow it."" 

She sat beside me and looked me in the eye, concerned. 

""What's the matter? 

""Weren't you always looking forward to playing this role? You were sad for a long time when the shoot was suspended. Remember? 

""After all, this documentary is based on the life of your mom..."" 

""I remember."" 

How could I forget? 

I'd been looking forward to the shoot of this movie. After all, it was based on the life of my mom, who was hailed as the Polaris of the astronomy world. 

In this movie, I could be as close to my mom as I had ever been before. 

However... 

I bowed my head in a fluster as a strand of warm blood flowed out of my nose. 

""Dora, I'm sick. I'm dying."" 

Dora was dumbfounded. 

Then, she hurriedly pulled some tissues to stuff my nose. 

""H-How did this happen? You're so young."" 

Competent and decisive, Dora had cultivated many A-list stars. She was known as a tough figure. Nonetheless, her eyes reddened at this moment.

Since then I've watched and read hours of tutorials and informative content on YouTube and other websites.

My espressos are still inconsistent.

  
Sometimes I make great espressos, sometimes I make mediocre espressos. Thankfully I very rarely make bad ones anymore.

  
I noticed over the time I've been getting into and researching coffee, theories of what makes a good brew rise and fall, new techniques appear and disappear. 

  
**Has anyone created a guide (ideally written, not a video) to espresso theory. I don't want something that just tells me ""grind finer/coarser"", I'd rather something that breaks down** ***why*** **grinder a fresher/staler bean coarser will lead to X or Y result?**

  
I also use a V60 which, in my exprience, is just simpler to get better results with. But it's a different kind of coffee and sometimes I'm just in the mood for an espresso.

Chapter 1 

On the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, the fake heiress jumped from the 38th floor. 

Before she jumped, she left one line behind: ""You can have my brothers, my fiancé, my dream life. Are you satisfied now?"" 

After being dragged by the entire internet for three years, I stopped trying altogether. 

When a troll told me to die and stop clinging to the Weld Group heir, I posted my diagnosis and replied, ""It won't be long before I'm gone. Be patient."" 

My eldest brother exploded with anger, warning me not to play tricks. 

My second brother gritted his teeth, tore the medical report to shreds, and pointed at the balcony. ""Go ahead and jump—make it quick."" 

I didn't jump. I didn't give them what they wanted. 

Instead, I bought a cake to celebrate my birthday. 

This infuriated them even more. They cursed me, demanding why I still wasn't dead. 

But then, when I was dying and truly lost the will to live, everyone started begging me not to die. 

*** 

As the clock struck midnight, I lit the candles. 

By the dim light, I folded my hands and whispered, ""Happy birthday, Corinne Shaw."" 

The words barely left my lips when the door swung open. 

My eldest brother, Royston Shaw, stood in the doorway, head down as he talked on the phone. 

""Don't be scared, sweetheart. We'll go with you when the time comes."" 

That gentle, soft tone was something I hadn't heard from him in a long time. 

Now, only Astrid Ladner enjoyed that tone. 

Kelsie was their newly recognized little sister, a rookie celebrity. 

I zoned out for a second. 

""What are you doing?"" 

A cold question jolted me back to reality. 

Royston had already hung up and was staring at me, expression indifferent. 

""Isn't it obvious?"" 

I pointed at the table, smiling, ""Celebrating my birthday."" 

Royston's gaze fell on the cake, and he paused for a brief moment. 

Then, his face instantly darkened. 

""Corinne, don't test my patience."" 

I kept my smile in place. 

Royston frowned and strode toward me. 

But someone was faster than him, rushing over and flipping the table in an instant. 

The cake crashed to the floor. 

Stunned, I crouched down to pick it up. 

Then a pair of dark gray leather shoes stomped hard on the cake before I could react. 

Instantly, cream and cake crumbs splattered across my hair and face. 

""How dare you? Today is the anniversary of her death!"" 

A furious roar sounded above my head. 

I looked up and saw Cecil Shaw, my second brother. 

He seemed utterly enraged, his eyes blazing with fire. 

He never wore black. 

But today, he had on an all-black outfit, with a white rose pinned to his chest. 

He was mourning his other sister on my birthday. 

I lowered my gaze. 

""I'm dying. Can't I even have a birthday?"" 

I hadn't celebrated in three years. 

Cecil frowned, turning his head away in disgust. 

He seemed tired of hearing me say ""I'm dying"". 

I gave a faint, indifferent smile, wiped the cream from my face, and stood up. ""What does her death anniversary have to do with me? 

""Besides, Tammy jumped on purpose..."" 

""Shut up!"" Cecil snapped, his anger flaring. A sharp slap landed across my face. 

The blow knocked me to the ground, my ears ringing. 

Cecil looked down at his own hand, still trembling slightly from the force, and seemed momentarily stunned. 

It was the first time he had ever hit me. 

The room went deadly quiet. 

After a long moment, he let out a cold laugh, his expression icy. ""You asked for it!"" 

He turned and went upstairs. 

Royston stepped toward me, stopping right in front of where I had fallen. 

Holding my swollen cheek, I looked up at him. 

He muttered, his tone indifferent, ""You don't deserve to mention Tammy's name."" 

Then he, too, left without a second glance. 

Chapter 2 

I slumped on the sticky floor. 

After what felt like forever, I pulled out my phone and took a selfie with the completely smashed cake. 

I posted it online with a caption: ""Cake's gone. What a bummer. 

""Got beaten up by Cecil. Hurts like hell."" 

Seconds later, notifications kept popping up nonstop. 

I opened the app. The comments section was already flooded with hate. 

""Serves you right. Why didn't he finish you off?"" 

""Ugh, that hideous face! Posting this for attention? Are you still dreaming of landing the Weld heir?"" 

""This is the real heiress the Shaws found three years ago? So shameless!"" 

""Real heiress, my ass! She's the psycho who drove the fake one to suicide! When will the Shaws kick this trash out and bring our sweet Astrid back?"" 

""You're a sinner. How dare you celebrate your birthday? The platform should ban her already!"" 

They called her a monster, a sinner... 

Every word cut deeper than the last. 

For three years, they'd insulted me constantly. 

No matter how hard I fought, I could never shake it off. 

I looked down, a bitter smile touching my lips. 

Whatever. I was already used to it. 

I was about to close the app when a meme popped up in my DMs. 

""You evil bitch, you're gonna pay for Tammy's life! 

""Go to hell! 

""Rot in hell!"" 

The words were written in glaring, blood-red strokes, like they'd been written in boiling blood, still dripping down the screen. 

My hands trembled. 

I almost dropped my phone. 

It took everything I had to slam the screen shut. 

I scrambled toward the stairs, barefoot, desperate to get to my room. 

But Royston was just stepping out of his study, coffee cup in hand. 

He took one look at me and snapped, ""Get lost."" 

I froze mid-step. 

Ever since Tammy Shaw's accident, I'd been banished to a room on the first floor. 

My brothers had made it clear—the second floor was off-limits. 

After all, that was where their favorite sister, Tammy, had lived; her room remained untouched, a place preserved in memory. 

After a moment, I lifted my phone, pleading, ""I'm scared. Just this once. Let me go up, please?"" 

Royston glanced at the screen, then leaned against the railing, staring down at me. 

""You're already as good as dead. What's left to be scared of?"" 

His gaze was icy. 

Then he turned and walked back into his study without another word. 

I stood there for a while before finally retreating to the living room, curling into a tight ball on the sofa. 

I told myself, ""It's okay, Corinne. It's fine. 

""You're innocent. 

""Tammy's death wasn't your fault. 

""Don't be afraid."" 

Tammy killed herself. 

Three years ago, on the night of my eighteenth birthday party, she jumped from the roof of the hotel. 

She left a suicide note with only two lines: ""You can have my brothers, my fiancé, my dream life. Are you satisfied now?"" 

Everyone decided then and there that I was the one who pushed her over the edge. 

My brothers had hated me ever since. 

I tried to explain. 

""You think you deserve a birthday?"" 

Cecil had lost it, trashing the entire banquet hall and scaring all the guests away. 

""Why did you have to come back and ruin everything for our family?"" 

His eyes had been bloodshot, like he wanted to tear me apart with his bare hands. 

If people hadn't dragged him away, I thought he would've killed me right then. 

So I went to Royston. 

Royston wasn't like Cecil. He was always more level-headed. 

But that day, he stood on the rooftop, ash from his cigarette drifting away in the wind. 

He stared at me for what felt like forever before speaking, his voice cold and hollow. 

""I watched Tammy grow up. She was ... always kind."" 

The meaning was clear: a girl like that wouldn't lie. 

I stood there, stunned. I wanted to ask him, ""Then what about me? 

""What does that make me?"" 

But in the end, I didn't have the guts to ask. 

I got lost when I was five. 

How could I ever compete with Tammy, the girl they adopted, the one they loved and raised for thirteen years? 

I was absent in their lives for thirteen years, after all. 

Chapter 3 

""Rinnie, everyone is waiting for you."" 

I was confused when Dora Tate took me from home to the film shoot set. 

Everyone who? Why was everyone waiting for me? 

After thinking about it, I remembered she was referring to the documentary ""Old Times."" The shoot was resumed. 

Tammy and I auditioned for it together three years ago. I passed, and she failed. 

She committed suicide afterward. The cyber violence was such that the shoot was suspended. 

It was said that it was resumed because it had a powerful new investor. 

Sitting in the room, I watched Dora bustling around and carrying my suitcases inside. 

Noticing the puzzled look on my face, she walked to me and said, ""The closed shoot will last for at least two months. Surprised, huh?"" 

She continued with a smile, ""Don't worry. The necessities are all packed."" 

Blinking, I asked, ""Can I...terminate my contract?"" 

""Terminate your contract?"" 

Dora was astonished. 

""The compensation will be enormous. Our company won't allow it."" 

She sat beside me and looked me in the eye, concerned. 

""What's the matter? 

""Weren't you always looking forward to playing this role? You were sad for a long time when the shoot was suspended. Remember? 

""After all, this documentary is based on the life of your mom..."" 

""I remember."" 

How could I forget? 

I'd been looking forward to the shoot of this movie. After all, it was based on the life of my mom, who was hailed as the Polaris of the astronomy world. 

In this movie, I could be as close to my mom as I had ever been before. 

However... 

I bowed my head in a fluster as a strand of warm blood flowed out of my nose. 

""Dora, I'm sick. I'm dying."" 

Dora was dumbfounded. 

Then, she hurriedly pulled some tissues to stuff my nose. 

""H-How did this happen? You're so young."" 

Competent and decisive, Dora had cultivated many A-list stars. She was known as a tough figure. Nonetheless, her eyes reddened at this moment. 

""How much time do you have?"" 

I blinked my moist eyes as I recalled what the female doctor had said. 

""Where's your family?"" she asked with red eyes. 

""Don't you have two elder brothers who spoil you? Why aren't they here with you?"" 

She was a senior to me at college. 

I lowered my head with embarrassment. 

""They're busy."" 

The doctor smashed her pen. 

""Busy? What's more important than your life? Don't they know their baby sister only has less than a month to live?""

Featuring a snarky Draco POV, competent Hermione, flashbacks to Death Eater Draco and Bellatrix.

The first draft is complete so expect weekly updates. Total word count is around 50k.

Summary

In the depths of his cell in Azkaban, Draco Malfoy is given the option to help someone other than himself. However, the person who needs him is none other than Hermione Granger. 

Drawing a line between guilt and remorse, Draco wants to be more than he was, but isn’t sure if he’s got anything left to give. 

Perhaps an act in good faith can help save them both.

Prologue Sample

She emptied the vial into her palms, rubbed them together, and started massaging the lather into his scalp. Her fingers were electric against his skin. He closed his eyes and luxuriated in the sensation. She took the comb and teased apart the locks matted together with blood. She was gentle and careful.
 
Draco wept. Fat, ugly tears streaked down his grimy cheeks. She didn’t mock him for it, even as his shoulders shook, and she only continued her ministrations.
 
“I don’t… I don’t deserve this,” he sobbed. “I don’t deserve kindness.” Shame coiled in his lungs, making his breath short and his throat burn. She paused and tilted his chin up with a sudsy finger.
 
“You don’t deserve kindness? Even if you lived for a hundred years, you don’t deserve a single nice act?” He lost himself in her coffee-coloured eyes—like deep oceans, drowning in them.
 
“Not from you.”
 
“If not from me, then how will you learn it?” She cupped his face and wiped his tears with her thumbs. Draco thought it was the single most intimate act he had ever experienced.",2,1764500717.0,Dramione,0,1.0,False

1pafe95,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1pafe95/i_realized_my_entire_personality_changed_after_2/,I realized my entire personality changed after 2 years remote and I didnt notice until last week,"So I have been fully remote since mid  2022 and honestly thought I was handling it pretty well. I mean I woke up, did my standups, hit my deadlines, kept my life pretty minimal. Nothing dramatic. But last week something weird hit  me when I had to go into the office for a quarterly meet. It felt like I was walking into a simulation of my old self.   
First thing I noticed was how loud everything  felt. People talking across open desks, phones ringing, someone microwaving fish at 10am . I used to be fine with that but now it felt like my brain was buffering. Then I realized I kept  saying sorry to everyone for literally existing. Someone walked past me and I apologized . Someone bumped my chair and I apologized again. One coworker joked that I was acting like a  polite NPC stuck in a loop. I laughed but it kinda stung because it was true. 

When I got home that night I tried to figure out what changed. I think remote work made me comfortable in ways that I didnt notice creeping in . I talk less. I overthink more. I keep my camera off even when nobody asks. I started scheduling my life around silence. And after two years of that, a single day in office felt like sensory overload mixed with stage fright. But the weirdest part was the next morning when I opened  my laptop. My apartment was quiet. My coffee was next to me. And I felt this wave of relief like I had escaped something. Not the work, just the noise and the weird pressure to perform being physically visible. I dont think I realized how much my social battery has changed . Or how much remote work shaped the way I communicate and even how I see myself . I dont have a big lesson or a rant. Just this feeling that remote work didnt just change my routine, it low key rewired my identity. And honestly I am not sure if that is good or bad, but its definitely  real in a way I didnt expect.",41,1764499545.0,remotework,12,0.77,False

1paf6ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1paf6ip/m42_7_months_later_and_im_still_not_over_her/,(M42) 7 months later and I'm still not over her.,"Sorry guys if this might sound long winded but I'm trying to figure out how to move on from my last relationship. I feel like some context would explain why I've been unable to stop thinking about her and just move past the breakup. First, my life since the break up is good. I kept the house, I got a new job, and got in shape. Not really ready to put myself out there yet because obvious reasons but I'm been working on myself alot, yet not a day goes by where I don't think about her and miss her. I know it's pathetic. 

The relationship lasted three years. When I started dating her, I was healed and ready to give this a shot and commit to this new situation. She checked all my marks, physically, mentally, I was head over heels. She reciprocated, wanted to spend as much time with me, but I gave it time. After three months, she asked, so are you my boyfriend? I paused for a sec and thought about it, I replied, ""Sure."" It was a dumb response, but I was elated. A month later she tells me she loves me. I was hooked. 

The honeymoon phase was great, we did alot of hiking, we would cook at my place, watched movies in bed together, go to restaurants, concerts, the coast. The sex was also great, we were compatible in every way. I tried not to think there was a catch but I just couldn't see any. About a year of bliss past by and my lease on my studio was over, they wanted to hike my rent up $300. I couldn't justify paying what they asked for. I told her I might have to move somewhere else, it sucked because she lived 5 min away in a 2bd house she was renting off her friend. She told me to move in with her, she felt safer having a guy around and it would be nice to spend more time with each other. I know living with someone can make or break a relationship, we a serious conversation about it. Boundaries, expectations, etc. I figured hell, we're doing so well why the fuck not. We're adults maybe the shoe just happens to fit perfectly. So I moved in. 

Well, she is not clean by any standards. Piles of dirty laundry everywhere, surfaces were not clean, there was even a strange lingering smell of wetness in the house. I discovered her basement was flooded, all the furniture they had downstairs was rotted and there was mold in the washer and walls. I immediately took care of all that and even got a mold inspector to clean it. Put me back a few bills but it was worth it. I should have seen this as red flags, but I talked to her about it, especially since I came from a hoarder environment, mess triggered me. She agreed to be mindful, that lasted about 2 weeks. I worked remote so I figured ok, I can do most of the upkeep that's fine. She works a demanding job and I'll just embrace my role as house husband. 

So because I worked from home, I didn't have a lot of friends. I only had about 3 years living in this city and most of it was during covid. I didn't want to get sick and there was no vaccine yet. I usually spent my time either at band practice twice a week, gym twice a week as well, and mostly with her. I did the 9-5 grind and she worked per diem. I setup my office in the basement so she can have her alone time. I Would only come up for 20 min for lunch and then clock out at 5pm everyday. She would sometimes get called in but would only work about 3 hours tops several times a week. She would craft, read, and cook for fun and I would mostly work. I would setup date nights, leave romantic gestures, sometimes cook her breakfast and make her coffee since I would wake up earlier for work. I did my best to try to keep the spark of the relationship, never once did she tell me there was an issue. Well, about our 2nd year came and she started demanding more space. She said she felt alot of pressure that she was the ""only"" person I spent time with. I would say that's partially true, but I'm also an introvert by nature. She was saying that she never felt alone, knowing I was was still in the basement. Even though she barely saw me during the day, she claimed she wasn't getting the space she needed. I agreed to leave a few nights a week from home, it gives me time to go do stuff on my own or hang with a friend. This went on for a few weeks and she still demanded more space. I basically told her well, I'm working when I'm at home mostly. I also pay rent, this space you need you should create it yourself. Go to the park, library, coffee shop. She agreed. 

We took a trip to the coast and saw all these cool houses and I teased the idea of maybe buying our own place one day. She didn't reply at all. I asked if she was ok, all I got was a stoic, ""yeah I'm fine"". I was weirded out by that and just decided not to press the subject. She was doing more things on her own, would buy concert tickets without telling me and then say we're adults and we shouldn't be be relying on each other so much, goes to lunches with her girlfriends more than usual. She would take ""girl trips"" sometimes for a few days. I was concerned. I tried to plan things and she would say yeah, I'll let you know and then nothing happens. I didn't get it. I pressed the issue plenty of times, what was the reason she was distant. She wouldn't give me any straight answers, just vague replies like, ""I dunno. I'm not sure what I want. You're a good guy and I love you, but I don't understand what's wrong with me."" I didn't understand, she's never told me anything I was doing wrong, I would have course corrected or compromised. I was completely in the dark. Yet she had no problem using me for emotional support, which I reluctantly gave because well, I loved her.

Soon we would get in spats for trivial things, she started with insults. Simple ones like ""God you're so dumb"" and then later would start swearing at me. She would say, ""How are you so fucking dense/stupid?"" To which I would sternly stand my ground and say I don't appreciate that at all. I never yelled at her, insult her, or put her down. I support her and love her, I expect the same. She wouldn't care, and the swearing kept happening. One day we were driving and I made a crass joke about some guy protesting to which she backhanded me really fucking hard in the chest. I was shocked. I told her to pull over and she kept trying to apologize and told me to stay in the car. I got out on a red light and uber'd home. Fuck that. I started packing my shit, that was a zero tolerance for me. She begged for forgiveness, I wouldn't budge. I left that night to a hotel. My phone would ring incessantly and I finally told her I'll talk to her in the morning. 

We had a conversation, she was full of regret and shame. We agreed that if she would go to therapy, I would stay. I wanted this to work so bad. I didn't want to move and give up on our life. But that was futile. Things were ok for a few months, she reciprocated, we would be happier around each other and do dates more. I felt like things were finally getting to how they were before. Then out of nowhere, another tonal shift. She stopped reciprocating, would gaslight me and give excuses to why she is distant. I told her how therapy is going, she wouldn't talk about it. I needed answers. So I did something I shouldn't have, I eavesdropped on one of her therapy calls. What I heard shocked me. She was lying to her therapist about me. She painted me out to be this abusive villain, keeping her from living her dreams. She said so much false things about me to her therapist, it just became an echo chamber for false victim-hood. I had enough of hearing it, I felt so betrayed. 

I was making preparations to leave, looking into my savings and shopping around for apartments. Then I was laid off, 2 days later my car's transmission went to shit. I now have no job or transportation. Fuck. I told her about my situation, no support no nothing. Her first response was, ""Well, you better try finding a job because I don't need you playing video games all day."" Which I don't, I couldn't believe that was what she chose to tell me. If it was me I would have been like, ""Don't worry we'll get through this."" It took me 4 months to find a job, but I had to use up my savings for car repairs and bills. I was not in a good financial situation. Those 4 months were the lowest I ever felt. Not once did she give me support or comfort, she would go do activities without me and not opt to spot me. If it was me, I would have paid for all of it, and not ask for a single penny back. 

Finally I got back on my feet financially, by this time we're almost hitting our three year mark. I could tell she checked out, she even got a second job on the weekend so she had an excuse to not have to spend it with me. I was miserable and drained. She had no problem using me for a double income and still expected emotional support. I had little to give. The day I ended we were having lunch at the dinner table and I noticed that they were re-releasing Revenge of the Sith. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and she knows it. I told her we should see it together, like when she bought me tickets to the Start Wars Symphony a year prior. She replied with. ""Well, I think you're better off going with someone who likes Star Wars more than me. And honestly, I feel alot of pressure to be the only person you're asking. If you want to talk to me about Star Wars or any other of your fandoms, I would appreciate consent."" I now have to ask permission to talk about things I was passionate about. I told her I can't do this. This is done. I can't be in this situation anymore. I ended it. 

She was surprisingly shocked. She went to work a few minutes after. I proceeded to setup my futon in the 2nd room. I moved my clothes to the other closet. I felt relief, but also extremely saddened. I cannot believe I was gas-lit and bread-crumbed for almost a year. My feelings were undermined. I was so mad at myself for letting it get to this point. I wanted to rage so bad. But I took time to leave the house and talk to a friend. I talked to family which I don't do alot, we don't have that close of a relationship. We had a long talk when she got home, we planned on what to do next. 

It took her about 2 months to find a place to live. I opted to stay because it worked out for me and she was talking about moving a little bit before we ended it anyways, this was her chance to finally do so. It was torture knowing she was in the other room and that I still loved her. I can tell she was flirting and putting herself out there. I found new lingerie and sex toys I never seen before. She would spend nights out doing god knows what. I could see her getting all doll'd up, more so when when her and I would go out. I wish she could've waited til I left to save me the emotional toil. She didn't care. I no longer recognized this person. It felt like everything we shared was for nothing. I never got straight answers. I would spend those nights alone with her cats, savoring what little moments we had left before she took them away. A week before she moved, we had this really weird and actually nice evening together. We watched some Star Trek and I asked for consent to talk about it, she was like yeah go for it it's ok. We had some wine and laughed about funny things that happened in the show. Towards the end of the night she thanked me for being amicable and not making this any harder than it has to be. We hugged for a long time. I started crying. This was all I ever wanted for so long. Like what we had before whatever it was changed her mind about me. She held me and told me she was sorry, sorry for everything. That one day it will get better, we're just not meant to be. I just broke down. I went to my room and just cried until I had nothing left and then went to sleep. I felt so pathetic. 

Moving day finally came and I expected her friends to be there to help. All of them flaked. Well, here I was dumb enough to help her with the move. I have a truck and I offered. I finally saw her new apartment and it was ok. It was comfortable enough. It took all day for everything to be moved, every box loaded was a dagger in my heart to say the least. I thought maybe we could use this time apart and maybe she can see what life without me would be like, and at least extend a hand of friendship. I didn't want to hate her despite the mental abuse she put me through for almost a year. I burned so may bridges, I didn't want this to be another one. She said she'd be back to pick up the cats and that she had to go to work for about 3 hours. I said that's fine I can watch them one last time and say my good byes. It was almost time to pick them up and she texted me she was on her way there. 

When she arrived we put her cats in their carriages and put them, in the car. I closed the passenger door and said, well, it's done. She then asks me If I remembered what I did with her wine fridge that was in the basement. I was confused and said, ""Oh, you mean the one you told me to get rid of? Someone picked that up a long time ago. The motor didn't work and someone offered to haul it away"" She replied, ""For free?"" Um, yes I didn't charge him. She again asks, "" So for free."" Yes, someone picked it up. I don't know what set her off but she goes off. ""Are you that fucking stupid or something that you can't say the word free? Seriously what is wrong with you? Say the fucking word FREE."" I was shocked. I just got done helping her move all day, no gas money, no gratitude. Here she is insulting me during one of the most difficult days of my life. I told her wtf is wrong wit her? Why are talking to me like this? She said a couple more insults to me and peeled out. What. Just. Happened. 

I'll never know the answers to this or any other questions I had. I had done nothing but love this woman the best way I knew how. I never once yelled, insult her, or crashed out. I supported her, made date nights, gave her gifts, took her on surprise road trips and had an amazing two years with her. She made me feel like the top of the world, the most peace I ever felt with another human at that time. She would call me the love of her life, that no man has ever treated her the way did. All I ever asked for was the bare minimum. I'll never know why things changed over nights despite the many attempts to communicate. Why did she end it the way she did after all I did to help her still? She saw me in pain, and had no empathy for me. How does a person go from loving someone so intensely to feeling nothing. It's been no contact for almost 7 months, and I miss her so much. I hated how she ended things and how our last year went, it's like she took our potential future with her. She reached out to me randomly and sent me an article about ICE raids with no context, might have been a mistake. I didn't reply. I know she moved on, but this is a woman with unresolved demons. I've always felt I had to compete with her traumas, I thought I could create a safe space where she can feel seen and heard so she can heal. That didn't happen. I fucking hate this. I've contemplated ending it because I know I'll never meet someone like her. What she became was so blindsiding to me, I no longer recognized her. I'm so tired of giving myself to other people like this. Not trying to be over dramatic but I just don't have the will power to want to pursue something with someone anymore. I can't stop thinking about my ex, literally everyday something reminds me of her. I feel a bit more numb sometimes, but I can't get her face out of my head. I deleted all our photos which was so hard to do. I removed any remnant of her. But still she haunts me. I should hate her with every fiber of my being, but I don't. I still love her. I hate myself for it. If you made it this far I thank you. I'm mourning her memory everyday, and I don't know how to make it stop. I tried dating other people, but it feels like I'm cheating on her. Clearly I'm not ready to put myself out there. I don't know what do to. ",1,1764498739.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1paf68a,https://i.redd.it/mu0isg0lgd4g1.jpeg,Single Shot settings,"Hello there. 

I owe the Sage barista touch machine and since I found a decent setting for my favorite beans, I didn’t touch anything. Now I thought maybe I use single shots to reduce my coffee intake. Haha. But I heard that the single basket which comes with it is shit? My questions:

- regarding my settings, what would you recommend adjusting for a single shot?

- if the basket is truly not good, any recommendations for a better one?

I use same beans since I have the machine. Coffee Circle „Grano Gayo“ if that matters. 

Thanks in advance

I looked like i was homeless pale skin, bags under my eyes, hands shaking because of too much coffee, yea one of the reasons could be the project I had been working on but I had finished it 2 days ago. So what had been making me wake up for 2 days? Last night I saw a figure tall and dark with its hands reaching its legs I screamed but no voice came out then I felt it I was paralyzed.
So I thought it was a dream and tried to sleep but I felt the creature coming more close so I opened my eyes and no one was there. Must have been my mind playing tricks on me. Atleast that's what I thought.
Today I went to a doctor and explained what happened the doctor said sometimes our unconcious brain plays tricks on us and makes us see things that aren't there.
Its 3:00 am rn I woke up to get water and when I came back in my room I saw the same creature sitting on my bed. I cannot move im feeling like im paralyzed again frozen on my spot.
