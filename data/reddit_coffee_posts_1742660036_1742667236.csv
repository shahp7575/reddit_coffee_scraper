1jheqe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1jheqe7/comparing_the_angel_share_alts/,Comparing the Angel Share alts,"I have been hooked on to the Angel's Share scent profile. I understand that it's not a scent profile that everyone likes. So, I ordered decants just to get a better idea of what each alt and twist has to offer.

Let's start with the twists:

Starting with the most famous - Khamrah: A more gourmand (feels the least boozy) and sweeter take on the DNA (I realize that it's closer to Gisa Savah than Angel's Share). Somehow I like the opening.  Projects like crazy and has fantastic performance (easy 10 hours in an AC environment and may even sniff it the next day on clothes)

Sharaf Blend: Similar to Khamrah than Angel's Share but is more boozy and less sweet that Khamrah - still sweeter than Angel's Share.

Khamrah Qahwa - Has a prominent coffee note and smells more masculine in the opening because of it. I find it a better fit for a man but what puts me off is the harsh and scratchy opening. It's not as well blended as some of the others.

Riffs Golden Reserve Privee - Smells exactly like Qahwa but feels a little better blended and boozier but is in the Qahwa vein. Performs similarly imo.

Royal Blend Nero - To my nose this smells a little similar to Qahwa. It's a darker and more intense take on Qahwa. I find it to be sexier than Qahwa but it can be too strong for a date night. Has the scratchiness that Qahwa exhibits too. 

Mawj Cognac Blaze - A very good blend.  No scratchiness here. I find it to be the most balanced with its booziness.  A good cross between Khamrah Qahwa and Angels Share. Has a prominent coffee note but doesn't perform like Qahwa does let alone Nero. Still, the sillage is very good and it lasts a good 8 hours. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Albait's Angel Share: Definitely the best but needs to sit for at least 3 months. Has that boozy opening that Angel's Share has and gives an easy 8 hours.

Royal Blend: The most balanced but somewhat airy and performs for around 6 hours. The dry down feels a little different than Angel's Share because of the iris note perhaps. Performance is the biggest drawback.

Kismet Magic: Smell is more boozier and prominent than royal blend but its performance is only 5 hours max - but for the price you can't complain. Close to Angel's Share as well.  Royal blend is also sweeter than Kismet Magic. ",1,1742667088.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,0,1.0,False

I've been doing a social media detox so I stumbled up on here to waste my time on another app. Exams are coming up and I cannot bring myself to study so I'm just hanging out on Reddit. Extremely sleep deprived and coffee fueled (even though I shouldn't be having it but its alr I'm not known to make the best choices). I'm can be your kinda nerdy friend who likes manga and anime (just like everyone on here honestly). KI like to read occasionally and I love cats. I don't have one tho.  Kinda like an animal lover without pets (I know it's unfortunate). The way I think having a pet would fix me. 
I'm kinda of a yapper if my vibe matches the person. But so many ppl on here are insecure and forget that people could have a life. 
One thing I cannot stand and engage in? Small talk. I can carry on a conversation but cannot talk to a wall either(do not take this in a rude way).So please introduce yourself, tell me how your weekend is going and how your week was. Telling me something that you've been wanting to tell someone so bad but don't have anyone to tell. Show off your pet and also tell me what their name is. Tell me the break up story. Tell me what keeps you awake at night ànd we'll see if we can keep it going. 
Also plz motivate me to study thank you.

Once I sold enough fish and unlocked Tuna, I realized I could make hundreds of Fish Fingers to sell on Tuesdays. I did this a few times, exponentially increasing my money each time, and after a couple days I realized I had essentially trivialized everything else in the game.

There's no reason to grow any crops other than to finish quests and make friendships. There's no reason to craft anything. No reason to fish. I can easily upgrade to the best equipment because I can just buy a bunch of gold bars. I can buy all the livestock I want, although there's no reason to since I can just buy milk and eggs.

Then I discovered there's a setting called Embargo Fish Fingers. So the developers knew this was an issue and made a setting to fix it, but didn't turn it on by default? All they would have to do is limit the daily inventory of tuna and the problem would be solved, but they decided to put a weird setting in there instead?

I'm debating starting over, or maybe I'll turn on the embargo and blow all my money on coffee just so I have some reason to keep playing.",1,1742666644.0,wyldeflowers,0,0.67,False
1jhejuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulum/comments/1jhejuk/kimpton_aluna_tulum_review/,Kimpton Aluna Tulum Review,"We just stayed at the Kimpton Aluna Tulum resort for 5 nights in March 2025.   We had 2 rooms.  One was a king balcony and the other was the King 1 bedroom suite balcony.  The resort has 2 buildings that mirror each other.  The rooms were very clean upon arrival.  The king suite did have a sulphur (rotten egg) smell to it toward the end of our stay.  We never mentioned it as there are only 2 rooms of this type at the resort and we very much enjoyed our private rooftop oasis.   There is a lot of shade on the resort and we appreciated this.   The rooftop pool has several shaded bali style beds that are first come first serve.  I found both pools to be quite chilly but refreshing.  I would imagine that during the hot summer months they would be quite nice.   The pool on the ground floor has a pool bar however, we never saw anyone bartending it (but to be fair, we only swam in the ground floor pool once).  There are 2 restaurants onsite.  One that serves all day and a rooftop restaurant for dinner only.  We had breakfast included with our room rate.  It is a buffet style but you can also order a few items from the menu (eggs, enchiladas and 1 additional dish that I can't remember).  The buffet offerings included 3 hot dishes (these were different everyday but one was also some sort of egg dish), plenty of fresh fruit, yogurt, and assorted bread and pastry.  There is also self serve coffee, orange juice and hot tea.  Each evening between 5-6pm there is a signature cocktail and a beer option along with a few small bites.

Our room was quite spacious.  A living area with a tv and a 1/2 bathroom.  There are 2 sliding doors to separate the living from the bedroom.  The bedroom had a comfortable king sized bed, a large shower and a separate toilet room.  Off of the bedroom was a balcony with 2 cushioned chairs and a small table.  Off of the living room you can access the winding staircase up to the rooftop.  On the rooftop is a thatched roof area to provide shade. There are 2 chairs, 2 ottomans, a bench, and 2 chaise loungers.  There is also a jacuzzi tub.  We were in room 314 and the rooftop area is viewable from a small section of the rooftop pool area.  

The resort has approximately 20 bicycles that you can borrow (included in daily fee). There were also 2 tandem bikes. These come with a lock so you don't have to worry about someone stealing them when you are out and about.  We used them to bike approximately 4.5 miles to Lula Beach club.   There are many pot holes so just be aware on the ride to avoid injury.  The bikes are 1 speed, pedal brake bikes.

1jhej5d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jhej5d,"Didn't want to rush into Easter with an untested recipe, so here's sourdough paska a month in advance","For those not aware, paska or kulich is a traditional pastry eaten for Easter in some Slavic cultures. For all intents and purposes, it's very similar to panettone, although I'm told that in Western Ukraine paskas are often not sweet at all, being more akin to fat-rich decorated bread.

What I made has the funky taste and texture that's somewhere between white bread and a typical paska or panettone. It's quite sweet, but not really overwhelmingly so, and it's really good with a cup of coffee or tea or perhaps a glass of wine (if your family is anything like mine and dry red wine is a staple of your Easter breakfast).

I used [Vertuta cooking's sourdough paska recipe](https://youtu.be/QISIOOdDo7g?si=Riz4bsM5UaaMAnnn) as relayed in text [here](https://apostrophe-ua.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/apostrophe.ua/ua/article/lime/lifestyle/2024-04-28/drojji-ne-nujnyi-retsept-paski-na-zakvaske-kotoraya-poluchitsya-nejnoy-i-aromatnoy/57816?amp=&amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQIUAKwASCAAgM%3D#amp_tf=%D0%94%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%3A%20%251%24s&aoh=17366230693960&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fapostrophe.ua%2Fua%2Farticle%2Flime%2Flifestyle%2F2024-04-28%2Fdrojji-ne-nujnyi-retsept-paski-na-zakvaske-kotoraya-poluchitsya-nejnoy-i-aromatnoy%2F57816), but I'll save those that don't understand Ukrainian from the potentially horrible consequences of trying to Google translate a recipe and relay it myself, with my own notes and mishaps. 

So, **sourdough paska**

**For the leaven:**

- 60 g active starter
- 180 ml water
- 180 g all-purpose wheat flour

**For the rest:**

- 350 ml milk, room temp or warm
- 100 g butter
- 1 egg
- 2 egg yolks+1 for the egg wash
- 200 g sugar *(yes, really)*
- 30 g vanilla sugar *(you can use less, I certainly only had 16 g; alternatively, use vanilla extract)*
- 600-650 g AP wheat flour
- raisins/dried fruit/candied fruit/etc. to taste

**Make leaven:** Preferably in the evening, mix 60 g starter with 180 ml water, stir. Add 180 g flour and mix until it's roughly mayonnaise consistency, like you'd do with your starter. Cover with clingfilm or a clean dry towel and put in a warm place for the night (10-12 hours). 

**Make the dough:** In the morning, get a big bowl and mix in it milk, sugar, salt, softened/melted butter, vanilla sugar/extract, and egg+ yolks *(at this point I somehow lost any and all idea of what my hands were supposed to be doing and added 2 eggs and 1 yolk as opposed to vice versa; doesn't seem to have affected the outcome too much, but paskas are usually yellower)*. Mix thoroughly. Add your leaven and mix thoroughly again. Cover with a towel and put somewhere warm for an hour.

After that, add your flour, preferably through a sieve, and knead it in. Be the flour lump exterminator you were meant to be and try your best to make the dough as even as possible. Cover with a towel again, let rest for an hour.

After that hour, you should be seeing a rise. Knead the dough - you might find that it's springy, but doesn't hold shape very well, this is exactly what we want here - and back to towel jail it goes, once again for an hour.

Add a bit of flour *(a bit is roughly 17.3 eyeballs, that is to say I have no idea, maybe 2 tbsp? Check out the video for a visual reference)* and your inclusions of choice *(the text recipe says your raisins should be washed, and this is literally the first time I'm hearing about washing raisins; the video just says ""add raisins"")*. Knead. If the dough didn't feel that springy the last time, it should feel that way now *(at this point I was finding it an absolute pleasure to knead, even if it was sticky)*. Towel jail again, but only for 20 minutes.

Divide the dough into several equal parts and put it into smaller tall-ish round forms. Each individual part must not take up more than 1/3-1/2 of the form.

The forms might get tricky: I managed to find some disposable paper ones made specially for paskas, but if you don't have access to anything of the sort, any old big enough tin can will do, just line it with parchment. For reference, I used 3 forms about 15 cm tall and 20 cm in diameter and had enough dough left over to fill at least one more, hence the odd flat rectangular paska.

Towel jail for half an hour.

Preheat the oven to 180°C.

The recipe tells you to apply egg wash (just 1 egg yolk) at this point. I wasn't too sure about that, so I did this for one of them, two others I egg-washed 10 minutes before they were done, and the flat one had no egg yolk on it at all. Imo the first one turned out the loveliest, all dark and shiny, bug they all look good

Bake at 180°C for 40-50 minutes.

Let cool for at least 15 minutes, then decorate as you please - the usual choice is icing or white glaze with sprinkles and/or festive fondant thingamajigs. Seeing as this was a test run, I didn't do any of that, except for when I dropped one of them and was superstitiously told to sprinkle sugar on it.

Boom, voila, happy Easter if you celebrate, happy sweet pastry eating if you don't!",1,1742666570.0,Sourdough,1,1.0,False

My hope has been to start tasting the notes in coffee better since I could not in espresso very well apart from liking the coffee or disliking it (and basic notes like bitter, sour). I have mostly gravitated toward light roasts as I prefered them in espresso over the dark roasts.

I have been looking at a new grinder that I would use almost exclusively for filter coffee since I think my Kingrinder K4 does pretty well with espresso. I have looked at the 1zpresso K-ultra and the Fellow Ode gen 2. I like the idea that the KU might produce a cup that I can distinguish notes better, but for the Ode, I love how its electric, so I would make the process easier. I have looked at other posts that are similar, but most people only have experience with one, but not the other. The price difference at the time is at best 50 euro difference, but that is with the 1zpresso from Aliexpress, which I don't know how the customs would work. It's 35 euro difference if I order the KU through Amazon instead. The cheapest Ode 2 I can find is about 298 euro in Czechia.

I have not considered the K6 from Kingrinder as some people say the KU has better clarity despite similar burr geometries, and I would love to experience that. I also don't know if I would like the ZP6, but it is interesting that people say there is crazy flavor separation. I am concerned I may not like that, nor if I make coffee for visitors, they may not like it either.

If anyone has experience with ordering in EU from Aliexpress (and specificially Czechia, if that matters) please let me know. If customs adds more to the cost, then saving a little more for an Ode that is already in the EU seems like the best option. Also, my budget is really what I decide to save up for, but I doubt the wife will be happy with a purchase much over 300 euros.",1,1742666464.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I (39F) have been on Bupropion 150mg ER SR, (once in the am) for about 2 weeks or so. The first week was great, I was able to do everything I needed to do and I had minimal side effects. But as time has passed I've noticed that it has worn off a little. It helps for sure, but I'm not able to function as well as I did when I first started it.   
Also I've been experiencing side effects,  I feel chest tightness from time to time and my left arm feels hollow, especially if I drink a little bit of coffee. Also sometimes I feel like I'm breathing fast, I just checked my bpm while sitting down and it was 96bpm so while normal, it's still on the high side.

The good news is that I have been drinking much less coffee than I used to but the bad news is that my anxiety has gone up and so have my sugar cravings. It also doesn't help that I have been dealing with medical issues so I have that worrying me.

 I guess I just wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced these side effects and if you think the the higher dose that was prescribed by a psychiatrist would help or just make it worse.   
I sent a message to my provider asking the same question but until then I figured I'd ask people's experience on here. 

How was your experince with different doses? Did the side effects get worse when your dose was increased or at what point did you maybe stop experiencing side effects? I know I'm experiencing classic side effects but they can still be anxiety inducing, especially if one has never had these issues before. 

Please if you don't mind sharing your experience. I'm planning on picking up my other prescriptions but I'm going to wait until I hear from my doctor before I start them. In the meantime I would love to hear how this experience was for you. Thank you!",1,1742666296.0,bupropion,1,1.0,False

1jheekn,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jheekn/some_advice_from_an_italian_living_in_italy_to/,Some advice from an Italian living in Italy to those who want to travel to Italy to avoid scams,"If you go to Rome or the main Italian cities, pay close attention to these things:

- Never accept bracelets or necklaces from those who tell you that they are gifts, they are never gifts and will probably ask you for money back. Sometimes they throw you the bracelet so that you instinctively take it and then, as above, they try to convince you to take something out to send them away. The only advice in these cases is to completely ignore these people and not stop to talk to them at all, even at the risk of being considered rude.

- In Florence, some guys put fake paintings on the ground in the middle of the crowd, where one can easily step on them and then ask for money for compensation, they are not usually aggressive, but only slightly insistent.
Even in that case, it is better to completely ignore the people and go away pretending not to hear them.

- In Naples, as stated in the initial point, there are people dressed as Pulcinella or Neapolitan horn sellers, the former offer you a photo with them and then expect to be paid, a bit like those who are dressed as Gladiators at the Colosseum. For the latter, sellers of bracelets, horns, handkerchiefs or various knick-knacks, the approach is sometimes simply like ""Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?"" Never answer, ignore them and carry on, their goal is only to make you buy something and extort money.

- Finally, always be careful around tourist sites of those who offer to give you directions to take a photo or give you suggestions on how to do it, it is never free and always paid.

For taxis: always make sure the taximeter is on, never negotiate the price first and find out about the official rates on the websites of the municipal administrations of the cities where you are, so you can point out to taxi drivers, in the event that they propose a certain price, that theirs is too high. If you intend to pay by card, always point this out to the taxi driver first, since some use the excuse of having a broken POS to evade taxes.
Furthermore, official taxis throughout Italy are white, the others are abusive and illegal.

To eat, avoid restaurants or bars in the most central tourist streets, they are usually only crowded with tourists, especially those with waiters outside inviting you to come in, you eat badly and spend a lot.
Try to go to eat outside the tourist areas, where Italians usually go.
If you really have to go to a tourist area, even for a coffee, always ask for the menu first, at least you know how much you will spend.

To visit operas, parks, museums and monuments, always book on the official websites of the opera or museum and never buy fake tickets or tours there from those who want to extort money from you to offer you a tour at the last minute by skipping the line, they are ripping you off on the price by probably making you pay double. 

For now this is all that comes to mind, for any other questions or doubts I remain at your disposal  ",23,1742666261.0,travel,1,0.96,False

1jhecv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1jhecv8/behind_the_detectives_smoke/,Behind the Detective's Smoke,"Hey all, this is another story I wrote. I hope you all enjoy it; it isn't necessarily one of my favorites but I figured it would fit in here with the channel! I've considered doing my own narrations of some of my stories, but this one in particular I actually wrote with Ronnie's voice in mind. It just seems like it'd fit him and his style, especially with his music and sound mixing.


*Behind the Detective's Smoke*

That cold and rainy morning, that poor woman died; forever frozen in her final moments with a look of pure terror etched to her stone face. The knife was bagged as evidence and the coroner packed her away in a black bag. I took a long drag off my cigarette and slowly pushed the smoke out of my lungs, wondering behind my glassy eyes how humanity was capable of such depths of depravity.

My partner, Frank, looked over my shoulder at the forested scene, closing like a book on our initial investigation. ""Welp, lets say we get outta here and actually get some good coffee, aye?""
I didn't hear him at first. My ears were ringing with the strange sense of recognition; the feeling had plagued me since we arrived. Her face, so cold and smooth, seemed almost ethereal. It captivated me, and I couldn't help the feeling that I knew her. Once I realized my partner was, in fact, talking to me, I acknowledged him with a curt nod and lead the way to our patrol car.

""Say, Frank, you notice anything... weird, about that woman?""

""Other than the kitchen knife sticking out her chest? Nah, can't say I have. Did you?""

""I think I know her, but I... I just can't place her.""

""Look pal, our minds play tricks on us. Chances are you saw her on the street the other day or something. Lets just focus on the facts we have, not what you think you saw God-knows-when.""

He had a point. I wasn't going to get anywhere on this case with the fog in my head I currently held. I shook my head, as if I could physically rid myself of the opressing mist, and opened my notebook to review while Frank drove to the cafe. Ash fell from my cigarette and smudged the paper.

A few days later, we had made some solid breakthroughs. The woman, Katherine Greenwich, was a local with an... extensive criminal record. Drug charges spanned the past 20 years of her life, and the department all seemed to think it was an altercation with a dealer. But why then, was a kitchen knife found in her heart, and why were her prints on it? The only footprints on the scene were hers, and some random deer. I didn't think the hooves odd, we were on a hiking trail after all. I was almost certain this was self inflicted as well, due to the angle of the blade. Something was very, very off, and I wasn't sure what.

""New case. Frank, Gary. You're up, we got a matching MO."" The chief tossed a file on our desks, which were positioned to face each other. We got up and went to the address, another hiking trail on the south end of town.

This time, it was a man. He had a butcher's cleaver sticking out of his torso- yes, his heart. How on earth someone would wedge that through a sternum, I had no clue. But there it was, his hand still clasped around it in rigor mortis, as if he were pushing it in to butter. My partner looked at me and raised an eyebrow. ""Odd. Maybe he was trying to pull it out."" I shrugged and immediately began working the scene.

The only prints on the blade were his, and once again, no footprints besides the deceased were anywhere to be seen. I took note of his ID: Timothy Harrison, Age 42. His face was still frozen in that horrible expression, the same that the woman was wearing a few days prior.

I turned away to comb the nearby forest floor for any footprints or evidence that might have been missed. I, once again, found deer tracks. Odd, considering this trail was considerably more travelled than the last. Something in my stomach twitched, an instinctual feeling that this would be important. I snapped a picture with my cell phone, just in case. After a thorough sweep, I packed up my gear and went back to the car.

""Hey, Frank. You notice the deer tracks?""
""What deer tracks?""
""These,"" I said while shoving my phone his direction. ""They were at both sites.""
""Well, yeah, we're in the middle of the fuckin woods.""
""I know, but, there shouldn't be deer here. It's too heavily travelled. I've got a weird feeling man, just trust me on this. Is the other crime scene still secured?""
""Yeah it is. I'm guessing you want to go?""
""If you don't mind skipping coffee.""

Frank groaned, but obliged my request. He knew when I was after a lead, I wouldn't stop chasing it until it was good and dry. We pulled up to the site, and I almost stepped out of the car while it was still moving in my haste. ""At *least* let me park first."" He put the old sedan in park and we got out. I half jogged to the place I'd seen the hooves, then snapped another picture with my cell.

I opened my gallery to look, and... thats odd, did not take the picture? No, wait. It did... but these hoof marks looked similar. Too similar. They both had the same chip off the right point, and a strange hole towards the bottom left of the foot, leaving a raised dollop of dirt in it's wake. 

The same animal? On opposite sides of town? That didn't seem right at all.

I showed the pictures to my partner, who tried not to show how intrigued he was by the similarities. It was an absurd notion, yes, but it was laid out plainly in front of us. Something was traversing the sites, and leaving this as it's only evidence.

Three days later, another file slammed on our desk. Frank and I followed the same ritual of a coffeeshop run on the way to the site, and when we pulled up, the familiar scene greeted us.

On the last call, poor Timothy had been identified as a butcher from nearby. He had no criminal record, but his cleaver had gone missing. I suspected, without confirmation, that was the one firmly lodged in his sternum. The coroner still hadn't been able to pry it out of the bone.

This time, a young boy lay spread on the woodline on his own property. His parents had reported him missing, and when the police showed up to comb the area, they had found him; here, with his father's ornate letter opener delicately poked through his ribs into the dead center of the small heart. His face had the all-to-familiar shade of terror, and on a child, the stark contrast of his innocence made the scene nearly unbearable.

I did my usual routine, but this time paid special attention to the dirt. After searching a few minutes, I found it- the hoofmark. I snapped pictures and gathered the rest of my findings, then waved Frank over to show him.

""Well... fuck."" He looked at the print, and my photo. ""So. How do we explain to chief that we have a murderous deer causing people to stab themselves?""

I shook my head solemnly, and we walked back to his car. My head swam with the events of the day and I tried to piece the puzzle together, to no avail.

I went mad, I say. Mad. The next two nights were spent pacing rather than sleeping. I picked up my partner's caffiene habit in addition to my vice, and my eyes became haunted by dark circles. On the third night, I could stand it no longer, and opted to go for a walk. My neighbor seemed to be surprised at my nightly endeavor and hurridly ran inside, punching numbers on his phone as he went.

The night air whipped around me, haunting me with whistles and low musical tones, strained through the trees like water leaking from a rusted pot. I pulled my windbreaker closer, cursing the breeze that put out my tobacco. I lit my zippo and tried in vain to relight it, but after it got soggy I gave up and spit it into the storm drain.

Fuck it. I started walking to the first crime scene. I needed clarity, and I needed it before the muggy air turned to rain and washed the prints away. I decided to take a shortcut through the woods under the full moon, which lit the street with surprising clarity despite the clouds overhead.

A twig snapped behind me. I jumped, anticipating someone there, but all I saw was a squirrel running across the trail. My hand hovered over my service weapon, and though I breathed a sigh of relief, I realized for the first time how stupid I was being. Alone, in the woods, with a known serial killer around these parts in particular? I needed to go home, what the hell was I thinking?

I began hurridly walking the other direction. As I shuffled through the leaves, I tried to ignore the cracking twigs behind me. My heart began to beat faster, and my palms started to sweat. I'm not a skittish person, why is this happening to me? It's almost as if the fear was instinctual, blanketing my body in a cold curse. I drew my weapon, and broke out in a sprint. 

A figure dashed in front of me, and I froze. It wasn't... couldn't be. A... deer? But this deer had spiralled horns with no protrusions, and was solid white. In addition, this deer stood on hind legs, hunched over as if it was topheavy, yet retaining it's balance. Upon further paralyzed observation, I realized this creature more aptly resembled a goat. I dashed into the treeline, firing off shots as I went, but somehow came face to face with the horrific creature once again. Those eyes... the rectangular pupils, they pulled my focus into them. I found myself drawn deeper through their depths, witnessing untold horrors and pain. I found myself clutching a knife, my knife, taken from my woodshop before my walk... why had I done that? I lifted it in front of me, and-

""GARY! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?"" I heard Frank's voice only a second before I felt his body crash into mine, his hand grabbing my wrist as we tumbled to the ground. He forced my hand, still clutching the blade, away from me, as we rolled through the detritus scattered across the ground.

I laid there, dazed and hazy, trying to figure out what had happened. My memory was all askew, and I couldn't understand how I had even made it to the trail at first. I suddenly realized the situation I was in, and asked Frank if he could please get off of me.

He obliged, taking his hand off of mine only when I released the knife from my grip. We exchanged glances, and the look we shared said it all. He silently escorted me out of the woods, and took me back to my home. We sat in the dining room while I put a pot of coffee on.

He asked me what I saw; I obliged him my tale. I knew how crazy I sounded, but Frank, bless his soul. He took it all with a stoic demeanor, never once doubting me or what I'd seen. After my tale was fully regaled, he sipped his cup, lost in wild thought.

""What are we gonna tell chief?""

""Shit. I have no clue.""

""I mean, I know a local group of kids was recently involved in a vandilism charge... they had done some kind of ritual, candles everywhere and red spray paint. One of them had even sacrificed a bird. Come to think of it... first vic was a witness we interviewed.""

""Shit. You don't think?""

""Well, if what you said isn't some sleep deprived suicidal nightmare, I don't know what to think.""

I lit my 4th cigarette since arriving home, my hands slightly shaky from the surge of nicotine. I knew what I'd seen. I also knew that I couldn't stay here, that it had seen me. Frank seemed to read my expression like a book.

""You gonna resign?""

I nodded.

""Well... damn. You were a great fucking partner man, best I ever had. I'm gonna miss you.""

We sat in silence, sipping our coffee as the dawn broke. I wrote out a resignation letter, and gave it to Frank to turn in for me. That night, I'd packed my essentials and started my drive across the country to my deceased parent's old property.  Their house had been left unmaintained for only 5 years, and I'd kept up on all bills. It would be fine for my impromptu move.

I never truly forgot the events of that night. I still get nightmares, even 6 years later. I never kept up on that old case either. I just tried my best to move on and live my life. I took up a less... sharp... hobby, ceramics, and managed to make my living selling hand crafted pots and vases online. But, sometimes, when the night gets cold and the wind picks up, I swear I hear sticks breaking outside my window, or strange huffing on my darkened stoop. I ignore them and stay in my home, which I had been sure to remove any sharp instruments from.

One day, I decided to pull some of the viney weeds in my flowerbed. They had begun to climb over my bedroom window, and I didn't appreciate them blocking the morning sunrise. That's where I saw it- the hoof. That damned hoof.

We have been together for almost 9 years, since we were 19. Moved abroad together from Italy to Germany 7 years ago and lived together since then.

My girlfriend always lied, since the beginning. The first 2-3 years she was just lying about her exams at the university (Bachelor, in Italy)  to relieve the pressure from her parents. But she told me that she never would have done that to me. And then, 1 and a half years ago, more than 7 years into our relationship, I found out her bank account was in negative of almost 1000 Euros and she did not tell me. I found out by reading a letter from the bank. I asked her why she hid this from me and that I could lend her money. But she said no and she was gonna ask her parents. She did not and repaid the bank by using her credit card. Making other debts. In the end I had to call her family to find out that they did not give her any money and she was sinking in debt. Very stupid story.

But then, things got worse. In the 7th year of our relationship she was still studying for her masters and lied once again to her parents, by saying the she was gonna graduate by the end of the year. She obviously did not and they found out. And they were mad at me and even my family for keeping the truth from them. I obviously did not know that they would not know.

This amount of lies really shocked me and I was gonna dump her. But I did not. Because I loved her.

But then she lied again. She told me her working contract was renewed for 1 year. But instead it was just 6 months. She lied to me about doing exams at university and stuff. All small and useless lies that added together really make me question if she is/was mentally ill.

Besides the compulsive lying, I also suspect that she has been suffering from a light depression in the last 2 to 3 years. She always had no motivation to finish her studies and find a full time job (she has been doing her master for 6 years now) and she would offen spend the whole day by watching Netflix, scrolling TikTok or play Candy Crush. Moreover, she told me a couple of months ago ""I have never felt happy in my life. I wake up in the morning and I am just sad"". I told her many times to go to therapy, she just went once and then stopped going. I offered her emotional support in every way I could to help her understand what she wanted to do and to find a way out. 

All these things really made me doubt the relationship, because I am an hard working guy, built a career and have already been working full time for 5 years. But I had the feeling that my partner was not making any effort and I therefore though that we had no future. Nevertheless I loved her and cared for her... And I was not able to leave a relationship that was not working.

Things then took a dramatic turn in the last 3-4 months. Her Granpa, who she really loved, got sick and doctors could not understand what was going on. I think then she really struggled with anxiety and depression, because she started spending a lot of time in bed, just scrolling on TikTok, often for the whole day. I tried to support her as I could but was in the end very frustrated from all the negativity, the depression and the rest that happened. I think I detached myself emotionally to not absorb even more negative energy from her, as I wad also struggling with some problems at work and in my family. 8 weeks ago, she broke up with me, because she said she detached herself emotionally from me as I did not offer the expected emotional support and consoled her in the moment of need. I felt like I was emotionally burnt our the last months tbh. She had the depressive episode number xxxx and I could not deal with it anymore. I told her to get to therapy. 

This is probably true. I really tried to support her, often hugging her and trying to cheer her up. But maybe this was not enough. Because, as said, I really tried to often detach myself emotionally to not absorb the negativity. I think I was extremely frustrated with her as a person and really had enough of everything.

2 months ago we had a final confrontation and I found out that she cheated on me while she was in Italy visiting her sick granpa. I have to admit that I went through her phone because I sensed that something was off. I found tinder stuff. She had a ONS with a guy. She obviously did not admit it and told me that I was crazy and needed to go to therapy.

But, since she broke up with me, I am broken. I cried a lot and had many sleepless nights. But I came to realise, with the help of my therapist, that she was not the right girl for me and that I should have ended the relationship a long time ago, when she kept lying over and over, instead of forgiving her. But I did not have the courage to do that. I also struggled and am struggling with hard guilty feelings for not supporting her in the last months. This drives me crazy sometimes. Since we broke up I can't sleep. I sleep 4-5 hours and wake up in the middle of the night with a racing heart....

She wants to keep talking to me and meet up for a coffee in 3-6 months. Tbh, I don't want to hear from her anymore. She is finally moving out tomorrow and I want to break contact forever. I don't want her back as she disrespected me in all the thinkable ways. Am I being cruel? 

Glad to hear your thoughts on this.

I need some advice on my new boyfriend. Apologies for how long winded this is. Tldr at the end.

I matched with a guy on Bumble and after some texting, we met mid week and went for some food and drinks to see if anything was there. We got on immediately and there was chemistry as well as easy conversation. 

He told me he was going camping at the weekend overnight with a good friend of his who is female and that they'd had sex before but it wasn't right and they were just mates. It sounded like a long term friendship, they gave being more a shot, it didnt work, they went back to being mates. Regardless, we'd just had a first date, he was being honest and I held no claim over him, so to speak.

Following the camping trip, he told me that on the drive up, he told her he has met me and that she got pissy about that for a while but got over it and they had a good time. This is where I started to get a bit uncomfortable, but I put that down to my trust issues and thought no more about it.

We've been dating for a little over a month now. He told me on the 2nd week that he wanted to be exclusive he's my bf, he's deleted his dating apps. It seemed a bit rushed to me and d idn't feel like a conversation but I really like him, and I really want a healthy relationship. 

At the start of this week I reminded him of something we were going to do together and suggested it for a Sunday morning. 

For context, I work evenings to support myself through uni, and those are his nights off from his 50/50 custody of his kid. So we have one morning, one afternoon, and one evening a week together. I had bought this up on our first date and we talked about when we would make time for each other, and that we're both willing to change our schedules should it get serious. 

Back to the problem at hand. When I bought up my plan for what we could do on our morning time, he told me that the same girl, had booked a camping spot and he was going camping with her. This kinda floored me, and I sent him a voicenote explaining that he was the one that wanted to be exclusive, he had told me their history, and that she had reacted badly to essentially, being unavailable to her. I said I wasn't comfortable with that, it crossed a boundary for me, not to mention he was prioritising time with her over time with me.

He immediately apologised and cancelled their trip and told me I am his priority and that he'd told her  and that he messed up.

Fast forward to 4 days later. I get a voicenote from him and by his tone, it's obvious he knows he's doing something wrong, he's talking through a fake smile. He tells me she had invited him round for dinner and he's going. They're going to clear the air, and he's going to tell her I'm his priority. I'm floored again, I thought this was done with. That's not entirely true, I'd seen on his fb that her post gushing about their initial camping trip after we met, had disappeared. So had her name in his friends list. Obviously this was bigger than I thought.
I voice noted him telling him how upset I was and that he's not talked this through with me, I'm in the dark, I don't know whats going on and who this woman is etc. He basically tells me he won't dump friends for me and stop speaking to them etc. I'm devastated, I don't understand where all this has come from, at no point have i asked him to do that. He goes to hers for dinner, when he gets home he sends me a voicenote while I'm at work being really sweet and telling me I'm his number one type thing.

The next day he sends me a song off Spotify all about making mistakes and sorry and how much I mean, then comes to my work before I start and leaves flowers. We meet for coffee the next morning to talk it out and I ask him to give me the full account of them. Turns out they met on tinder a year and a half ago and dated for a month, had sex a handful of times and according to him, he wasn't in to it so now they're great, close friends. He goes to her house every Thursday and they drink and watch TV together. They have their own show. He talks to her every day. She's the person he shit talks with.

I pointed out that she isn't his friend, she is hanging in there hoping they will end up together. He says that sometimes when they drink she gets a bit handsy but he always shuts it down. 

We discuss all this for an hour or so and we part ways with him saying he's going to pull back with her and focus on me, and me feeling happy and content and safe again.

But now, later in the day, I feel like I'm being an idiot. Is this man playing me? I'm trying really hard not to bolt from relationships when they get hard, which is my typical MO, but I have a niggling feeling that he's not being straight with me.

I need some guidance please. I don't really know what to do, and I don't have anyone to ask.
Thank you in advance and please be kind, I'm doing my best not to be an idiot. 

Tldr: new bf is still very close with ex tinder gf he says is just a friend. She's angry about me. Seems off. Is it?",1,1742665831.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

I finally added him on Instagram today, but now I'm wondering-should I message him and ask him to grab coffee? Or would it be too weird since my mom has kind of played matchmaker here? He obviously knows who I am since he works with my mom, but I don't want to come off as awkward.

I have been in Finland for a few years and I plan to stay here forever. I am married to a Finnish man that I met in my home country.

My husband has a few work colleagues but no real friends that he hangs out with (he’s fine with that, he’s a bit of a loner). I am a mathematician and work from home so I’ve had to rely on apps like bumble and tinder to make friends. Sadly I’ve only managed to convince other foreigners to go for a coffee, and we usually bond over the fact that we are immigrants. All but one of these friends I’ve made have returned to their home countries and the one that stayed is always complaining about life here so it brings my mood down so much that I’ve decided not to hang out with them anymore. 

My question is, how do I make friends with Finns? I am in real need of community. My interests are varied but I’ll say that I’m into cinema science and music.",17,1742665758.0,Finland,19,0.9,False

Phone notes? Work laptop? Personal computer? It was exhausting and I kept dropping balls.

**The moment that changed everything:** I was on a train home after a long workday when I realized I'd completely forgotten to update a critical deadline. My stomach dropped. That's when I knew my scattered system was failing me.

After researching solutions, I went all-in with Todoist's cross-platform capabilities, and it's been genuinely life-changing for my workflow. Here's what made the biggest difference:

* **True device-agnostic task management** \- I can start a task on my laptop, update it on my phone while waiting in line, and check it off from my watch later
* **No more ""which device did I save that on?""** moments
* **Seamless collaboration with my remote team** without email chains
* **Voice capture through smart assistants** for those random thoughts while cooking

The unexpected benefit? I've reclaimed those small pockets of time throughout my day that used to be wasted. Waiting for coffee? Quick task organization. Commuting? Review upcoming deadlines.

I wrote a detailed breakdown of my entire cross-platform Todoist setup on my blog, including specific workflows and how I integrated it with my team's processes: [Integrate Todoist Across All Devices: The Ultimate Cross-Platform Power Move](https://baizaar.tools/maximizing-todoist-app-features-cross-platform-2025/)

1jhdzu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jhdzu9/nf_see_you_next_summer/,[NF] See You Next Summer,"*Summer 1993*

In a town like Haven, summer didn’t sneak up on you—it arrived all at once.

One day you were sitting in a classroom, counting the minutes until the final bell, and the next, the world had cracked open into bright mornings, sticky afternoons, and the soft hum of cicadas in the trees. The whole town seemed to exhale. Bikes came out of garages. Sidewalk chalk reappeared. And for the kids who weren’t old enough to stay home alone but too old for babysitters, there was only one destination: *Summer Rec*.

The Haven School District hosted the program at Fireman’s Park—just behind my house. From 9AM to 3PM, it was the perfect solution for working parents and restless kids. My sister and I could walk there ourselves, or ride our bikes with playing cards clothes-pinned to the spokes so they made that low, satisfying flutter.

I loved Summer Rec.

It was structured chaos in the best way. You rotated through stations—crafts inside the old fairgrounds pole barn (which, blessedly, had shade), kickball on the baseball fields, lunch under the pavilion, and almost always, a swim in the city pool before the day was done.

It wasn’t just kids from Haven Public Schools either. There were kids from private schools. Kids from neighboring towns. Kids you didn’t recognize and might never see again once school started. That made Summer Rec feel bigger than it was—like a tiny glimpse of the world outside our 7,000-person town.

The counselors were mostly teenagers—high schoolers who could manage a clipboard and yell “heads up!” when the dodgeball went rogue. The snacks were basic. The rules were loose. The sun was hot. And to me, it felt like freedom.

It was the kind of place where you thought you knew everyone. Until, one summer, I realized I didn’t.

That was the summer I met Andy Brickner.



I think the first time I actually heard Andy speak, I wasn’t even sure he was talking to me.

We were walking between stations at Summer Rec—leaving the baseball fields, heading toward the pole barn where crafts were set up. The air was thick with that hot Michigan summer smell: cut grass, sunscreen, and the faint chlorine drift from the city pool. I was with a couple friends, and then out of nowhere, this voice cut through our conversation. High-pitched. Nasally. A little like Steve Urkel, but without the goofy charm—more clinical, matter-of-fact.

“You know,” it said, “the sun’s core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. If Earth didn’t rotate, one side would be unlivable within a few days.”

We all kind of slowed down, glanced around. That’s when I saw him—Andy. Standing about ten feet away, hands shoved awkwardly in the pockets of his gym shorts, squinting in our direction. But he wasn’t *looking* at us. Or at anyone. His lazy eye made it hard to tell where his attention was aimed. It was like he was having a conversation, but only with the space around him.

No one answered him.

He didn’t seem to notice.

Or maybe he just didn’t care.

I didn’t say anything back to Andy that day. None of us did. We just kind of… kept walking. It wasn’t that he said anything *wrong*—it was true, I guess, about the sun and Earth’s rotation—but it wasn’t exactly the kind of thing middle school kids were talking about between lunch and kickball.

Still, I started noticing him more after that.

Andy had this habit of orbiting group conversations without fully entering them. He’d linger on the edges—listening, waiting—but never quite stepping in at the right moment. It was like his timing was always half a beat off. We’d be joking around about something dumb like who could eat the most popsicles before puking, and then Andy would chime in out of nowhere with, “Did you know sharks can detect a single drop of blood from a quarter mile away?”

You could almost hear the record scratch.

Sometimes kids would laugh—not *with* him, but *at* him. And when that happened, he’d go stiff. His face would turn red, and he’d snap back with something like, “Well *you’re* an underdeveloped primate,” or, “Your brain is clearly two standard deviations below the mean.” It was always something smart-sounding, but just weird enough that it didn’t land like he wanted it to.

And then came the “snake” thing.

If someone really got under his skin—pushed him just enough—he’d fix them with this weird glare (or maybe just happened to look in their general direction), hiss a little, and bark:

“You are a s…s…s…snake!”

Always with the same delivery. Like he was quoting himself.

And always with that drawn-out “s,” like he was winding up for it.

The kids would howl, of course. Laugh, walk away, pat themselves on the back like they’d just won something.

But Andy didn’t walk away. He’d just sit back down, wherever he was—on a bleacher, in the grass, under a tree—pick up a book or mutter another random fact, and pretend none of it happened.

That’s what got to me, I think. Not the insult. Not the awkwardness. But the way he absorbed it all like a sponge. Like it was normal. Like he expected it.



By mid-July, Summer Rec had found its rhythm.

Mornings meant kickball or crafts, depending on the rotation. Afternoons usually meant the pool. And somewhere in between, there was always lunch under the pavilion—packed sandwiches, juice boxes, and the occasional trading war over fruit snacks or pudding cups.

Andy was still Andy. He still ate lunch alone most days, usually at the far end of one of the picnic tables, hunched over whatever book he’d brought with him. The other kids had learned to leave him alone—mostly. The teasing hadn’t stopped, but it had faded into the background, like the steady buzz of cicadas in the trees.

I hadn’t talked to him much. A few short exchanges here and there. But that day, after a long morning playing kickball in the sun, I wandered over to the craft station early to cool off in the shade. I plopped down on the grass near the edge of the pole barn, drinking warm water from a plastic bottle, when I heard his voice—calm, steady, and almost out of nowhere.

“You know the Mallard still holds the record for the fastest steam locomotive ever built?” he said. “One twenty-six point zero miles per hour. July 3rd, 1938.”

I turned my head. Andy was sitting cross-legged a few feet away, his lunchbox open beside him and a thick book propped against his knees. He still wasn’t looking at me—his eyes were on the pages—but he was definitely talking *to* me this time.

“That’s fast,” I said, brushing some grass off my shorts.

He nodded like I’d given the correct answer. “It’s British. Part of the A4 class. Streamlined body, long boiler, double chimney for exhaust efficiency.”

I sat up a little straighter, trying to follow. “You into trains?”

Andy looked up, just for a second. “Yeah. I like the mechanics. And the history. Trains changed the way people moved. Changed time itself.”

I didn’t know what to say to that, so I just nodded. “I’ve only been on one. At Greenfield Village.”

His face brightened slightly. “That’s the Weiser. It’s a 4-6-2 Pacific type. Coal-fired. Low speed, but classic AmAndyan design.”

He kept going, talking about engines and track gauges and something called “tractive effort.” I didn’t understand most of it, but I didn’t really care. It was the most animated I’d ever seen him—his words flowing easily, his hands moving slightly when he got to the details he really loved.

And I just listened.

Not because I was fascinated by trains, but because *he* was. And in that moment, it felt like that was enough.

When he finally paused, I asked, “So, what’s your favorite?”

He blinked, surprised, then said without hesitation: “The Flying Scotsman.”

I smiled. “Cool name.”

He smiled back—just a little. “Yeah. It is.”



It was one of those breezy afternoons where everyone seemed to have extra energy. Kickball had wrapped up early, and a bunch of us were hanging near the bleachers that sat between the baseball fields and the pavilion. Someone had brought a basketball, even though there wasn’t a hoop in sight, and the conversation had turned into an animated debate about who the best player in the NBA was.

“Jordan’s unstoppable,” one kid said, spinning the ball lazily on his finger. “Dude can hang in the air like he’s flying.”

“Barkley’s stronger,” someone else argued. “If it was one-on-one, Barkley would body him all day.”

“Nah, Shaq’s the future,” another chimed in. “He’s like a tank with sneakers.”

Names flew around—Jordan, Barkley, Ewing, Robinson, Pippen. I didn’t follow basketball religiously, but I liked it enough to keep up. I nodded along, chiming in here and there, mostly agreeing with whatever sounded coolest.

That’s when Andy wandered over.

I noticed him coming from the side of the pavilion, the same book still tucked under his arm, his shorts wrinkled, shirt a little too big. He lingered just outside the group, clearly trying to look casual, like he just happened to be walking by—but he was listening. You could see it in how he slowed his pace. And then, in that now-familiar voice, he jumped in:

“Actually, for Jordan to achieve a vertical leap of over forty inches, he’d need to generate more than 3,000 newtons of force during his takeoff phase. That’s, like, three times his own body weight.”

Everything went quiet for half a second. Just long enough for it to feel uncomfortable.

Then someone snorted. “What are you, his physics teacher now?”

Another kid grinned and added, “Hey Andy, how many trains does Jordan own?”

That got a couple laughs. Andy stiffened. His eyes darted away, and he shifted his weight from foot to foot. He opened his mouth, probably to spit out some fact in return, but I beat him to it.

“Chill out,” I said, stepping forward slightly. “He’s not wrong. Jordan’s got crazy hops. That stuff’s real.”

The ball kid shrugged. “Still weird.”

“Yeah,” I said, “but being weird doesn’t mean you’re wrong.”

That quieted them. Not all the way, but enough. The conversation shifted again, moving toward video games and whether the new Mortal Kombat was going to be banned or not. Andy stood there a moment longer, then gave me a small nod and walked off—not hurt this time, just… not needed.

But he wasn’t humiliated. Not today.



It was the final week of Summer Rec, and everything felt a little looser.

The counselors weren’t as strict with the schedules. Kids drifted between stations without much structure, and nobody really cared if you painted the same ceramic fish twice or skipped the last kickball game of the summer. The sun still beat down, but it felt different now—less intense. Like it, too, was getting tired.

That afternoon, I was sitting at the picnic tables under the pavilion, sipping on a Hi-C juice box and watching some kids playing hacky sack in the shade. It was peaceful. Slower than usual.

Andy walked up, holding a half-eaten sandwich in one hand, the corners of the bread crusts just slightly soggy from the heat. He didn’t say anything right away—just stood there for a second, like he wasn’t sure if he was interrupting.

Then he sat down across from me.

“I like Thursdays,” he said, unwrapping the rest of the sandwich. “They feel like the end of something, but not quite. Like you still have one more day to fix things.”

I raised an eyebrow. “That’s a deep thought for lunch time.”

He smiled faintly and took a bite.

We sat like that for a minute—just two kids, not talking about trains or science or basketball or anything that usually marked our conversations.

Then Andy looked up, and this time, he *did* meet my eyes. At least, I think he did.

“Thanks, Jeff,” he said. “For being a good friend.”

It caught me off guard. Not because it was untrue, but because I hadn’t thought of myself that way. I wasn’t his lunch buddy. We didn’t hang out after Rec. I hadn’t even told him my birthday or asked about his. I just… didn’t treat him like crap.

I shrugged, but not in a dismissive way. “Yeah, man. Of course.”

He looked back down at his sandwich, then added, “Most kids don’t talk to me. You did.”

There wasn’t anything I could say to that that wouldn’t sound too big or too small. So I just said, “I’ll see you next summer.”

Andy gave a small nod. “Okay.”

Then he stood up and walked off, leaving his sandwich wrapper perfectly folded on the table like it had been pressed under a book.



Sixth grade felt like a promotion.

We had lockers now—real, metal lockers with built-in combination dials. Not the kind you shared with your little sister to keep your pencil case and field trip forms. These were tall, clunky, a little dented, and completely ours. A rite of passage.

I remember sitting on the benches across from the sixth-grade locker bank, one leg bouncing nervously as I tried to memorize my combination without having to sneak a peek at the paper in my pocket. The hallway still smelled like fresh wax and pencil shavings—early September in a small-town school.

That’s when I saw him.

He was walking down the hall, eyes flicking from door signs to classroom numbers, like he wasn’t sure he was in the right place. His backpack looked new—one of those stiff ones with the creases still in the fabric—and he clutched a folder close to his chest like it might fly away if he didn’t hold on.

Andy.

For a second, I wasn’t sure it was him. The lighting was different. No picnic tables, no books about steam engines, no quiet space under a tree. Just rows of lockers and the low murmur of hallway noise.

But then he smiled.

“Hi, Jeff!” he said, his voice still unmistakably Andy—nasal, sharp, and cutting through the hallway like a radio station slightly off-frequency.

I blinked, caught off guard. “Hey! Andy… what are you doing here?”

He stopped and gave a confused look, like the question didn’t make sense. “I go here now.”

“Yeah… yeah, I just—didn’t know you were switching schools,” I said quickly, trying to cover my surprise. I hadn’t even thought to ask back in August. Summer Rec ended, and I’d packed it away in the same mental drawer as the rest of summer: over and done.

He shrugged. “My mom said I should try public school this year. She thinks I need more social interaction.”

There was no sarcasm in the way he said it. Just facts. Like announcing the weather.

“Well,” I said, standing up, “it’s good to see you.”

He smiled again—small, but real. “You too.”

Then the bell rang, and just like that, he was gone, swallowed up in the shuffle of sixth graders fumbling with schedules and locker combos and oversized binders.

I watched him walk away and felt something twist in my chest. Guilt maybe, for not asking more. Or maybe just surprise—that Andy Mania, the science kid from Summer Rec, was now part of my everyday life.

And I hadn’t even seen it coming.



If I thought middle school would be different for Andy, I was wrong.

Haven Middle wasn’t cruel on the surface—it wasn’t lockers getting slammed in faces or swirlies in the bathroom. It was subtler than that. The teasing lived in whispers behind cupped hands, in smirks passed between kids when Andy raised his hand too often or gave an answer with a little too much detail.

He hadn’t changed much from Summer Rec. Still walked a little stiffly, still muttered facts under his breath like background noise, still had trouble knowing when a conversation had ended. And when he was uncomfortable—which was often—he’d talk faster, his hands fluttering a little, as if trying to smooth the air between him and everyone else.

Some teachers didn’t know what to do with him. Others tried their best. But middle school runs on invisible social currents, and Andy never quite caught the rhythm. If anything, he drifted further from the beat.

He’d sit alone at lunch, same as before. Occasionally, he’d try to join other tables—usually by leading with a fact or a comment about space travel or ancient civilizations. The kids would either ignore him or look up with that blank, flat smile people give when they’re waiting for someone to walk away. And eventually, he would.

The bullying wasn’t constant. It came in waves. Some days, it was a taunt in the hallway. Other days, just an exaggerated laugh as he passed by. It wasn’t always the same kids from Summer Rec, but the tone was familiar: Andy as the punchline, Andy as the spectacle.

He still fought back, in his own way.

Still relied on words. Still shot back with facts or awkward insults—less “snake,” more “your brain is under-evolved” or “go back to playing with your crayon logic.” Sometimes it landed. Most times, it didn’t.

And I?

I was there. Not always, but enough.

When I saw something happening, I’d steer him away, same as I had under the trees that summer. I’d distract, deflect, find an excuse to pull him toward adult supervision. It wasn’t heroic, but it was something. And I told myself that counted.

I wasn’t close enough to be his friend.

But I wasn’t far enough to pretend I didn’t notice.



It was the last week of sixth grade.

There was a buzz in the air—an end-of-year ceremony, or maybe it was just the looming promise of summer. Either way, the school had asked all the sixth-grade boys to dress nicely. Button-up shirts. Ties. Something that said “we’re older now” even if we still carried Game Boys in our pockets and watched cartoons after school.

I wore a shiny blue silk shirt and a Looney Tunes tie—the one with the Tasmanian Devil spinning at the bottom. I liked it. It was fun. But more than that, it was allowed. My parents didn’t let us wear anything with the word *devil* on it—not even for the school mascot, the Haven Devils. But somehow, the Tasmanian Devil passed the filter. So that’s what I wore.

I remember sitting on the bench by the sixth-grade lockers, nervously adjusting the knot. The hallway buzzed with movement—dress shoes squeaking, kids comparing ties, teachers corralling students toward the multipurpose room. And then the teasing started.

It didn’t take much.

A couple of boys pointed. One leaned over and whispered something, then laughed louder than necessary.

“Nice tie,” one said, grinning like he’d just made the joke of the year. “Did your mom pick it out for you?”

“Taz? What are you, five?”

The others laughed. It was the kind of moment that wasn’t cruel on the surface—but it hollowed you out just the same. I remember the heat rising to my face, the way my ears burned. I wanted to disappear. To fold myself into my locker and close the door behind me.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw him.

Andy.

He was walking toward us, dressed up the best he could manage. His pants were at least two sizes too big, bunching awkwardly around his ankles and cinched with a belt that wasn’t quite doing the job. Every few steps, he’d stop and yank them back up. His white button-up shirt was wrinkled and buttoned wrong at the collar, and a faint brown stain—coffee, maybe—marked the front like a bullseye.

He caught sight of us and smiled. “Hey, Jeff.”

That’s when the attention shifted.

“Oh look,” one of the boys snickered, “Andy dressed up like a *grown-up baby*.”

Another one jumped in without missing a beat. “Dude’s wearing his dad’s church clothes and still couldn’t find the soap.”

Laughter erupted. A couple of the guys actually clapped, like it was open mic night.

Andy’s smile wilted. His posture stiffened.

And then—he looked at me.

Not with anger. Not even with panic. Just… with quiet hope. A silent, pleading look that said *please*.

Please say something. Please step in. Please don’t leave me hanging here.

I looked away.

One of the boys caught the glance between us and smirked. “What’s wrong, Andy? Is Jeff your *bodyguard* now?”

More laughter. Louder this time. And I just sat there—frozen, ashamed, and grateful that it wasn’t me anymore.

They moved on eventually. That’s what kids do. Like storm clouds passing fast over the sun, the shadows didn’t last long for them. Just long enough for damage.

Andy lingered for a moment. Then, without a word, he tugged at his waistband again and walked the other way.

I never saw him after that.



Andy wasn’t there for Summer Rec later that June. He didn’t return to Haven Middle School when seventh grade started. Or eighth. No one talked about it. No one asked. And honestly, I didn’t either. I told myself maybe he moved. Maybe his mom pulled him out. Maybe it was temporary.

But I think I knew better. I think he left because he couldn’t stay.

I still think about him sometimes—his awkward smile, his random facts about steam engines or space travel, the way he clutched his lunchbox like it was armor. And the way he looked at me that day, silently asking me to speak up. I search for him now and then—on Facebook, LinkedIn, old classmate pages. Nothing. Maybe he changed his name. Maybe he stayed quiet on purpose. Or maybe he never made it out of that space between being seen and being invisible.

It took years for me to realize that Andy showed all the signs—no eye contact, fixated interests, social missteps. He was almost certainly on the autism spectrum. I know that now. Because my son is too.

Aiden is curious, brilliant, and funny in ways you don’t expect. When he was younger, he loved trains—*The Polar Express* is still a holiday favorite in our house. He struggles with social interaction, especially with kids his own age. But he finds comfort in the things he loves: fishing, hockey, and rattling off sports trivia like he’s calling a live broadcast.

And as I watch him grow, I can’t help but think of Andy. I think about how cruel kids can be. How isolating it must’ve felt to be the punchline every day. And it hurts to imagine someone treating Aiden the same way. That they might look at him and see “weird” instead of wonderful. More than anything, I pray he finds better friends than I was at that age.

The world has changed. We have the words now. The understanding. The support systems. Andy never had that. He had classmates who laughed at him, teachers who didn’t understand him, and people like me—well-meaning, but distant. Friendly, but only when it was safe.

And in the moment he needed me most, I stayed quiet.

I used to tell myself I didn’t understand. But understanding isn’t a requirement for treating someone with dignity. You don’t need a diagnosis to be kind. I was selfish. I was looking out for myself. And I have to live with the fact that the last thing I ever gave Andy Brickner… was silence.

It wasn’t a big moment. It wasn’t life or death. But it mattered.

It mattered to him.

And it matters to me now.

If I ever found him—if I saw that familiar squint or heard that nasally voice rattling off facts about steam engines—I’d stop him. I’d tell him I remember. I’d tell him I’m sorry.

And I’d tell him he mattered.

Because he did.

Because he does.",1,1742665175.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Making time to write is a challenge to people. We have busy lives, families, and full-time jobs that demand so much of our energy. In this post, I share 4 tips for those out there who struggle to find time to write.

1. Choose A Writing Space- It could be a library. It could be a coffee shop. It could also be a small corner in your living room.

2. Write During Your Commute. – While you may not be able to pull out an entire pen and pad on the subway, you can jot down notes on your phone to flesh out later. Believe it or not,  it’s possible to come up with fairly good ideas instead of just staring up at subway ads.

3. You Don’t Have to Write it All At Once- Don’t feel compelled to write a complete project from start to finish in one sitting. No need to write 1000 words at once- your schedule may not permit this. You can break it down in three or four sessions.

4. Lock In Your Writing Time- Protect It.

Even if it’s only an hour. As busy adults, not everyone has 3 to 4-hour blocks of time to commit to writing. What you do establish as your writing time, protect it. That means no timeline scrolling or any thing like that. It will only distract you.

These are some starter tips. Hopefully, you find them helpful. That’s it for this post. Take care, and enjoy the rest of your day.

1jhdwj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jhdwj1/aita_thug_life/,AITA - Thug life…,"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster. Settle in, this is long. 

So I’ve had an horrific day and just want to get some…feedback, on my handling of a pretty rough situation. 

My husband (37M) and I (34F) took our two year old out for an early Mother’s Day coffee with my in laws. This group consisted of my husband, our toddler, mother in law, father in law, sister in law, brother in law and their 3 year old as well as myself. 

Now I’ve always been a shy and anxious person, my husband and I have been together for almost 18 years, he’s used to me being non confrontational and passive in public then having a cry or rant when in the comfort of my own space, be it the house, car, etc. I didn’t really get to know my husbands family for a long time out of body confidence issues and my alternative style - his family are as vanilla as they get whereas I’m heavier set and had bright hair, multiple tattoos and piercings. We’ve always gotten on until last summer. I’ve been having a lot of serious health stuff go on as well as going through multiple rounds of IVF and miscarriages to finally be blessed with our little gremlin (I promise, it’s a term of endearment, he’s perfection in my eyes!), so I’d pulled back from a lot of meet ups with my husbands family. Last summer we were all meant to go away together for a weekend, nothing overseas or major like that. I then saw our family WhatsApp group flash up a notification on my phone screen and was horrified and took screen shots so fast my phone could barely understand what was going on. I then opened the app to see they’d been deleted. THANK GOD FOR SCREENSHOTTING. My sister in law was dragging me for filth about how she bets I’ll not ‘bother’ going and that my husband and child will be begging their parents to cancel their apartment stay to get the money back and ask to shack up with his parents in theirs. I saw the red haze and finally stood up for myself. I told her how nasty she was for clearly being comfortable insulting me to their mother behind my back but always complains to my face she wants to spend more time with me. I told her that as she’s nearing 40, she needs to grow up and focus on her own life. Side note - She’s had a strange obsession with what I wear in more recent years, sadly I’ve lost a bit of my colourfulness and have gravitated towards the beige mum style. So any new shoes, bags and even a necklace my husband surprised me with with my sons initials engraved on to it after his birth, she has bought and flaunted shortly after. She then fought back saying how ‘it was true’ what she said, I said she should have said it outright not now she was being confronted due to her own stupidity and not checking it went to the right chat group. She then went in an odd direction by saying how she wants to be close to me and I should reach out more. I told her that her first messages where the exact reason I wouldn’t be bothering going forward. I put everything aside and still went for the weekend, put on the typical people pleaser front and made nice. I did it for my son, I would never do or say anything negative in front of him, kids are off limits. My husbands family acted like nothing happened and we have seemed to merge back into normality again…

Fast forward to today, we’d finished coffee and went for a walk around the shops as a group. Our little one was able to use a mini shopping trolley (cart in other countries) designed for kids and went along helping us do some food shopping. Now, we’ve entered the ‘terrible twos’ headfirst and our little gremlin is definitely happy to let us all know how he feels. When I was paying for the shopping, my husband took little one to put the trolley away. I found the in laws and asked where my husband was, my sister in law rolled her eyes and tutted as we hear a loud cry and squeal. Ah, that’s my boy. I was annoyed at her attitude but went to get them both and talk little one down from WW3. He then wanted me to carry him, still roaring the shop down. As I walked past the in laws, sister in law said to her son (a year older than mine) ‘see, you’re a good boy’. I almost lost it and just walked fast and for the exit. I was anxious enough that my child was getting lots of head turns and he wasn’t calming down, my mother in law was further down the shop, nearer to the exit and saw my face. She asked what was wrong and I simply said ‘your daughter is a piece of work’ whilst walking back to the car in the carpark. I got myself and son in to the car and waited quietly for my husband. I didn’t want to fight, I just wanted to remove myself from the situation. Everyone then swarmed the car to ‘say goodbye’ to my son. His mother opened my door to give me a hug goodbye, saying ‘don’t know what all that was about’ and I said ‘you’re going to side with your daughter, I can’t help that but I will not have my son used as an example of poor behaviour whilst saying how her child is being a good boy’. My brother in law was at the other side of the car, leaned in and snapped ‘lose the attitude’ in the most threatening tone. He’s never said more than two words to me in all these years. So I looked him dead in the eyes and said ‘or what? Is that a threat?’ he then rolled his eyes and said goodbye to my son, fussing over him more than usual to make a weird point. Sister in law then said she didn’t do anything wrong to which I said ‘you said how your child was being good, right as my sobbing child is being carried in front of you, as if my child isn’t good or my parenting isn’t good. I walked out and didn’t want to hear it, if you didn’t mean it as a dig, why say it there at that moment? I’m not going to do this in front of the kids. I’m done’. She then said how I talk to the family like a thug and I’m a disgrace. I genuinely felt her husbands words were threatening and I asked a valid question in response - if I didn’t ’lose the attitude’ what was going to happen? She was shouting, bear in mind, they’re all surrounding the car and in a public car park, the only thug was her. My family are rougher around the edges with each having a…colourful life and I knew what she was getting at, another dig at me and my family. I’ve always been the black sheep of the family, quiet and never in trouble, so she clearly made a vile jab at my family. She said I’m a bitch and a disgrace - I was sat in the car with my two year old after removing myself and child from an uncomfortable situation that I didn’t want us to be in any longer. She spoke like that in front of two toddlers, but I’m the thug?! My husband didn’t hear much of this as he was fighting with the pushchair in the back of the car so didn’t step in or fight in my corner, making it look like he agreed with them. His sister then shouted she is only going to see my son with my husband and not me, like she has control or authority over my own womb fruit. I had my husband leave me at my parents house and only now, 5 hours on have I finally spoken to him. He’s horrified and livid about what has been said but he’s so bloody passive he won’t say anything, despite him saying he will.

So please help me out, was I the arsehole? Should I have done things differently? I’m struggling to see how removing myself and child from the situation was worth being surrounded and ripped to shreds? ",1,1742664939.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I am posting here to get your opinions on what color pillows we should get for our gray ikea couch, and what color rug we should get for under the coffee table (which we’re also not a big fan of but have had since being renters) - I’m aware that the flooring is dark so I’m very confused about what to do. Also, our walls are bare and we were thinking of doing a collage of family photos (framed) on top of our fire place. But the wall above the sofa and above the TV is still bare - do you have opinions on these things?
I’ve been trying to find some pillow covers that go with everything but I don’t really like the yellow green print thing :/
Also, our living room extends to the kitchen and dining area (where the bookshelf is) and we ordered a new table and chairs (I added photos of them in case that makes a difference in suggesting stuff) and we really don’t like the light above the dining table from the previous owners. And, lastly, we have a LOT of plants so our living area looks like a little garden (we like this haha) 

I am very eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions!!! I also included pictures of some rugs we were considering as options :)

If you're looking to elevate your outdoor space, a 6 piece outdoor patio furniture set is a perfect choice, combining style, comfort, and functionality. These sets typically include essentials such as a sectional sofa, coffee table, and often additional accent chairs or ottomans, creating an inviting atmosphere for both relaxation and entertainment.

One of the key advantages of a 6 piece outdoor patio furniture set is its versatility. It can seamlessly fit into various outdoor environments, from cozy balconies to spacious backyards. This means you can entertain guests or enjoy a quiet evening under the stars, all while surrounded by comfortable and aesthetically pleasing furniture.

Durability is another important aspect to consider when investing in a 6 piece outdoor patio furniture set. Many sets are crafted from high-quality materials such as weather-resistant wicker or aluminum, designed to withstand the elements. Additionally, cushion covers are often made from fade-resistant fabric, ensuring your furniture remains vibrant and fresh through the seasons.

When selecting a 6 piece outdoor patio furniture set, think about the color scheme and style that suits your personal taste and existing decor. From modern minimalist designs to classic rustic looks, there’s a wide range of options available. Popular color choices include neutral tones or bold shades that can serve as a focal point in your outdoor setting.

Lastly, consider additional features that enhance your patio experience. Some sets might include built-in storage solutions, adjustable reclining options, or even retractable canopies to provide shade when needed. This added functionality can significantly improve your outdoor living space.

I met this guy on tinder but it really started out as a joke because I was looking for a CPR instructor to teach a class for me, and he just so happened to be certified. I never mentioned this part to him at first, but he gave me his number and then he asked me if I wanted to get coffee with him. We went and got coffee and then we went for a hike. It was fine, nothing crazy happened he didn’t even hug or try to kiss me. This was about 4 weeks ago. He never texted me after this, so I honestly didn’t really care and I figured that it was just a one time thing and that was that. He texted me about 3 days ago and asked me what I was doing and if I wanted to go out to his grandparents house to see some cows because he was housesitting for them. So I go, and we see the cows, and drive to the state line, and it was fun. We brushed our teeth together, he played with my hair, and I slept over. We didn’t have sex or anything it was just a make out sesh before bed. The next morning he made me coffee and we just talked and then I left. He texted me later that day “Thank you for the fun night 🫡💕 (I texted)” because I had mentioned to him how he never texted me before. Anyways, now I’ve been left on read for over 24hrs and I’m just trying to see where I stand with this guy. I haven’t liked someone this much in over 5 years so I’m kinda going crazy. He is leaving for Europe in a few weeks for a month, and I just can’t tell if he is into me and doesn’t want to push it, or if he just doesn’t care.

We flew into Puerto Vallarta. Once you exit the airport, turn left and on the side of the airport you’ll see a bridge- take that over the road, and order your Uber. It was about $35 and we tipped 20% for all hospitality services. 

The food: 
Dinner at Margarita’s House. 
The BEST quesabirria tacos I’ve had in my LIFE. Margaritas were fantastic as well.

Dessert - there is an ice cream taco truck called Rollado’s. We went here daily per my 6-year old’s requests. 

Northside- We ate breakfast here and enjoyed coffee and a smoothie every morning. It was so good I didn’t want to chance a bad breakfast by going somewhere else. I got the Gringo Breakfast Sandwich every day. I didn’t eat the side salad - unsure if the vegetables were washed with clean water and did everything I could to avoid food sickness. 

Rustica - I’ve seen all the good reviews and it did end up being fantastic. I’d go back again for the Ceaser Salad and the Ravioli - game changers! 

AlleyCat boat tour - we did a 4-hour whale
Watching tour and it was fantastic. Went with my 6-year old and my 75- year old father. Open bar and food, awesome staff, and the swimming time at the end was awesome. 

There were 3 of us and we never got sick. We were careful to not drink any tap water or ocean water. We didn’t try any adventurous taco carts, although some were busy with tourists. Drink more water than you’re used to. You will do great!  ",2,1742664383.0,sayulita,0,1.0,False

Transcript

Today, we’re diving into something that’s quietly revolutionizing the world of small businesses: artificial intelligence, or AI. Picture this: you’re running a small shop, a freelance gig, or maybe an eco-friendly startup. You’re juggling a million tasks—marketing, finances, customer service—and you’re wondering, ‘How do the big players do it?’ Well, here’s the secret: they don’t anymore. AI does. And here’s the kicker—small businesses like yours are jumping on board too. A recent report found that 89% of small business owners are already using AI to boost productivity and streamline operations. That’s not just a trend; it’s a game-changer. So, what does this mean for you? Stick around, because in this video, we’re going to explore how AI is leveling the playing field, share real-world examples like Repurpose—an eco-friendly brand killing it with AI—and give you practical, implementable ways to bring AI into your own business.  
So, why is AI suddenly everywhere? It’s not just hype—AI is solving real problems for small businesses. Think about the stuff that eats up your day: repetitive tasks like scheduling, answering basic customer emails, or crunching numbers for your budget. AI can handle that, leaving you free to focus on the big picture—like growing your brand or dreaming up new ideas. That stat I mentioned earlier? 89% of small business owners are using AI, and they’re not just tech wizards. These are people running bakeries, online stores, consulting firms—you name it. The report says they’re automating routine tasks, which doesn’t just save time; it boosts efficiency and even job satisfaction. Imagine not dreading Monday mornings because the grunt work’s already done.But here’s where it gets introspective: Are you holding your business back by doing everything manually? I mean, we all love the hustle, but what if you could hustle smarter? AI isn’t about replacing you—it’s about amplifying you. Take Repurpose, for example. They’re an eco-friendly brand making compostable products, and they’re using AI to automate their financial processes, optimize marketing campaigns, and even streamline employee evaluations. That’s not just efficiency; that’s competing with the big brands without a massive team or budget. So, ask yourself: What could AI unlock for your business?  
Let’s zoom in on Repurpose for a sec, because their story is inspiring. They’re a small team with a big mission: sustainable living. But they’re not drowning in paperwork or guessing which Instagram ad will hit. AI handles their financial tracking—think expense reports and cash flow predictions—so they’re not stuck in spreadsheets all day. Their marketing? AI analyzes customer data to figure out what works, so they’re not throwing money at random ads. And get this: they even use AI to streamline employee evaluations, making feedback faster and fairer. The result? They’re growing fast and punching way above their weight.And it’s not just them. Small businesses everywhere are seeing this. A coffee shop might use AI to predict inventory needs—no more overstocked beans or disappointed customers. A freelancer might use AI tools like chatbots to handle client inquiries 24/7, so they’re not chained to their inbox. The benefits are clear: more time, less stress, and a real shot at scaling up. But here’s the deeper question: What’s stopping you from trying this? Is it fear of tech? Cost? Lack of know-how? Because here’s the truth—AI tools today are more accessible than ever, and they’re built for people like us, not just Silicon Valley giants.Okay, let’s get practical. You’re sold on AI—awesome—but where do you start? Don’t worry, I’ve got you covered with three simple, implementable steps.First, identify your pain points. What tasks suck up your time or drive you nuts? Bookkeeping? Social media posts? Customer support? Write those down. That’s where AI can step in.Second, pick a tool that fits. For finances, try something like QuickBooks with AI-powered insights—it’s affordable and user-friendly. For marketing, tools like Canva’s AI features or HubSpot’s campaign optimizer can help you create and target content like a pro. And for customer service? Chatbots like Tidio or ManyChat can handle basic queries while you sleep. Most of these have free trials, so you’re not locked in.Third, start small and scale up. Don’t overhaul everything at once—test one tool, see how it feels, and build from there. Maybe automate your invoicing first, then tackle marketing. The key is to experiment.Here’s the introspection part: Are you willing to let go of control a little to gain freedom? Because that’s what AI offers—a chance to work on your business, not just in it. You don’t need to be a tech genius; you just need to take that first step.So, there you have it—AI isn’t just for the big dogs; it’s for small businesses like yours, ready to help you thrive. Whether it’s saving time, cutting costs, or leveling up your game, the tools are out there waiting. What’s your next move? Drop a comment below—tell me one task you’d love to hand off to AI.

Maybe you want to practice your satin stitch or your French knots. I haven't been able to embroider in a long time and when I did, it was always according to the instructions. I've been following r/Embroidery and frankly, I'd like to get a little wild with my stitching! I've seen so much gorgeous work on that sub, it's very inspiring. I think it would be nice to embroider with a group of people and we help each other get better.

Using this post, a list of meeting places could be made. Suggestions that support local businesses are ideal. IE: get a coffee, a beer, a bubble tea while we stitch for an hour.

I'd like to vary meeting days and times a little. One week could be a Friday at 3, next week a Saturday at noon. I am leaning towards Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

I see this as being a safe group for people. If that doesn't work for you, get your own embroidery group. 

Right, so, any interest?",5,1742663769.0,olympia,1,0.86,False
1jhdfpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ResourceAmazing5438/comments/1jhdfpl/finding_grace/,Finding Grace,"Looking out into the bustling street in front of her, just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. 

A new day for her! For everything seemed new Grace’ 

A green eyed brown haired girl setting there gripping the handle bars on her bike, for the street just in front of her was long all downhill race for her.

Not really knowing how or why she was here, in a way that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, she only knew where she was at the moment!only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! 

Even though all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing as the excitement showed in her smile saying it all. Making her through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed by.

With Grace having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Grace! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety. 

For Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Grace being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge, found herself racing through the streets along with one or two others.

Not to say that one didn’t catch her eye from time to time his name was Hector’ Hector was a guy that charm on a dime. A Latino Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match especially on a bike. Often calling out to Grace saying 

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Grace’ whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them.

Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it,

Knowing that Grace was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Grace leaving him with a glance and a smile as Grace left him looking. 

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her.

While Grace’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. 

Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself on a bike, Grace would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city.

Telling Grace about his own street races, with Grace always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More than often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. Often finding herself dreaming of a life being on her own making her  own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular walked in to set down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. Oddly enough his name was Joe’ an older retired gentleman, A regular that Grace came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

Joe would often tell Grace about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for many great nights he had here in the mountains around us when he was younger.

Grace always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

For often Grace would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Grace for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget.

To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. 

Or on one of the many trails on the outskirts of town, Grace found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life on her bike loose and fast racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Grace had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Grace and Hector to a race, but not just any race a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Grace and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. 

Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Grace then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Grace are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Grace’s! All I know is how I feel about the Grace that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Grace giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Grace before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you ether laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Grace that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Grace and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Grace trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Grace then stopping to check as Hector then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Grace! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Grace had caught up to them, for Grace knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Grace then a hard look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Grace had won the race.

Later that evening Grace and Hector would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Grace just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector then saying goodbye to Grace as he then headed back to town leaving Grace there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Grace had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Grace just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this Chloe? And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Grace then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Grace your dreams.” 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Grace and it is not you”

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Grace then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home finding her usual self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace finding herself making her way through once more through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

1jhdef2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1jhdef2/fired_moved_out_and_now_moving_out_again/,"Fired, moved out and now moving out again","I’m (34f) really struggling with my situation right now and could use some advice from people who understand what it’s like to deal with alcohol use.

A little background: I just went through a really tough time… I was unfairly dismissed from my job about a month ago, which has left me feeling emotionally drained and financially vulnerable. My boyfriend (36M)  of over a year told me I could move in with him, which felt like a blessing at the time. However, now that I’ve been living with him for about three weeks, I’m starting to feel like I’ve walked into a whole different reality.

His friend sometimes stays over in our living room, and together they drink a lot. This weekend alone, they’ve already gone through three boxes of beer and two bottles of Jack Daniels. I’ve tried to be understanding and not make a big deal out of it, but this morning, I finally spoke up.

I woke up, had my coffee, and started tidying up. I casually said, ""Good morning, boys. Just letting you know, I’ll be going camping with the girls tomorrow. Today, I’ll be cleaning the house because Qs parents are coming over for a barbecue, so please keep it tidy and don’t mess it up. Clean up after yourselves.""

My boyfriend completely lashed out at me. He got super angry and snapped, saying it’s his house and that I can’t control what they do. I wasn’t even trying to control them… I just wanted some basic respect for the space we share.

Now I’m feeling lost. I didn’t expect to move in and suddenly be living in what feels like a frat house. I love my boyfriend, but I’m not okay with this level of drinking and the way he reacted to such a simple request. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells in my “own” home, and I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if this is a serious red flag. I’ve been paying rent too - definitely not free loading. 

Has anyone dealt with a situation like this? How do you handle it when a partner’s drinking (or their enabling of drinking) starts affecting your peace of mind? I don’t want to be controlling, but I also don’t want to live in chaos.

After readings endless posts here all day I’m getting the gist that it’s progressive and only gets worse. He’s a “high functioning “ alcoholic. Has a great job good family but really poor friends. Our argument has escalated tonight and he’s basically throwing me out saying I have a couple of days to find a new place that he’ll give me $1000 to make it an easy process. That I can’t just move in pay rent and think I own the place regarding the request for a clean space. 

Any advice would be really appreciated.",3,1742663663.0,AlAnon,4,1.0,False

Just now it ended when the Ruscho skidded out at 80kph during a long turn and went airborne. I had about five seconds to chicken out and close the game before the car hit the ground again but didn't. I had recently finished moving out of my parents' home to live off the grid in Pigman's cottage, with rally racing, Teimo's ads and kilju being my main sources of income.

Here are some of my accomplishments on this now lost save file:

\- Survived a handful of Jonnez wipe outs, a dozen plus high speed Satsuma roll over accidents, a couple of Hayosiko roll over accidents, got side swiped by Pena a handful of times, head on collided with Pena while pushing the Gifu to 100kph on the gravel road, and survived glitchy physics while attempting to collect haybales (gave up after collecting about 10 of them)

\- Bought all the magazine car parts

\- Racked up a legal income rate of about 130 000, which made it impossible to pay even modest fines in practice. I don't know if the stat screen is correct in saying I earned 750 000mk, seems like a formatting error

\- Smoked enough cigarettes to spike the stress rate for the achievement (while sitting off a 5 day jail sentence)

\- Spent several weeks on the island to detox the stress rate and accidentally made the sauna hit 700 degrees celcius by clipping several dozen split logs into the furnace which took several more weeks to cool off

\- Picked 1000+ berries for the achievement

\- Won the junior cup twice, finished 7th in the amateur cup at best

\- Got the drag racing achievement, which apparently does not need you to go under 17 seconds but under 17.999...

\- Hit 200kph in the Satsuma

\- Finished Suski's storyline

\- Won the Ruschko and cottage, which became my new home (and the Ruschko eventually killing me)

\- Won the full pot on the slot machine

\- Got blind after partying at Jokke's new home

Over a 2 year period I’ve managed saving 30k from my part time job at a coffee shop, I’m not a spender, and if I ever buy anything it’s thrifted or second hand, I’m looking to buy a house in a few of years hopefully, but what should I do for now?  I graduated early which has allowed me to work more over these 2 years and save, I still live at home and I’m not going to college I tried it but it wasn’t for me. High yield savings? Retirement? I’d love to hear advice from adults or people who are educated on the topic, because that’s not something I have access to, thanks for reading!

Is this normal? Is there a way to reduce it? Is it just the quality of the shaker?

It doesn’t drastically reduce the weight of the coffee so it’s still okay, but this doesn’t happen when I just use the dosing cup that comes with my Niche. It’s also kind of annoying to see so much coffee stuck there.",1,1742663003.0,espresso,33,0.55,False

Create an image.

A detailed cartoon illustration in the biting, dry, and pointed style of The New Yorker. The setting is a cheerful, sunlit park near Capitol Hill, with the U.S. Capitol dome visible in the background and cherry blossom trees lining the path.

In the foreground is a parody lemonade stand with a large, bold banner reading: 'CONFLICTS OF INTEREST – OPEN FOR BUSINESS!'

Behind the stand are two men:

A chubby, smug-looking tech bro with short dark hair and a black baseball cap, wearing a hoodie.

A tall, older, unhealthy, heavyset white man with wavy blonde hair, wearing an expensive suit, exceptionally long red tie and American flag lapel pin — a caricature of a career politician.

On the table:

A printed price list sign with three items:

1. 'Legislation: $500K'.

2. 'Agency Appointments: $10M'.

3. 'Anti-Trust Delay: $100M (Bulk discount available)'.

A large glass tip jar labeled 'Donors Only' filled with thick envelopes marked 'Dark Money'

In the midground, two casually dressed citizens walk by holding coffee cups. One leans toward the other and says in caption: 'If he did this behind a closed door, it’d be a scandal. But out here, it’s just Tuesday.'

1jhd38i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jhd38i/seeking_advice_i_27nb_dont_know_how_to_stop/,seeking advice: i (27nb) don’t know how to stop interacting with my ex (28m),"i know the title sounds a little silly and spineless but please bear with me. 

tw: mentions of sex, sexual assault 

Background information: 

i dated my ex from the ages of 21 to 23. we met on tinder and everything moved pretty quickly and within about 2 weeks, we were talking pretty seriously about the relationship. he ended up moving back to their home town and i went to college but we continued dating. things were fine for about a year and then we hit a steady decline. 

i was dealing with some severe depression and body issues that prevented me from having sex and this shut me down pretty hard. i did my best to communicate with him what i was going through but my explanations never seemed to be enough and it would turn into these 3-4 hour long intense conversations where it would feel as though he was trying to psychoanalyze me and i would become peeved because it felt as though i was trying to offer answers and explanations as succinctly as i could and he just wasn’t happy with what i was offering and so we would go in circles. these conversations were unbelievably tiring and it got to a point where i didn’t even want to talk to him for fear that it would turn into a hours long monologue. 

when we were together physically, he never seemed to want to do anything besides lay around the house and sex became a huge issue. as i stated, i was going through some sex repulsion and he knew this but at points, still insisted on attempting to have sex anyway or “just getting naked and seeing what happens.”

one incident in particular stands out to me because i had mentioned many times to him that i hated having sex on my period, it’s painful, messy and the sensory overload is too much. not to mention i’m so focused on all of those things that it becomes impossible to enjoy myself. however, in this instance, i told him many times i didn’t want to have sex because i was bleeding and he told me to “get over it” and when i made a disgusted noise when it was over he told me to “stop whining, it’s just blood”. 

i hesitate for some reason, to categorize this as sexual assault, probably because i’ve been through much worse but it always sort of turned my tummy and ruined the rest of that trip for me. after that, i only started seeing the worst in him. he yelled at service workers, he was always smoking or drinking, i even began to hate the way he talked and smelled. 

i continued in the relationship for probably another year after that and my depression and anxiety only got worse and as a result, he only got more frustrated. i acknowledge that i was not my best self during this time. i was not always communicating clearly or being the most supportive partner. to this day i feel guilty for not being a better communicator and person.

there was a time or two where i tried to broach the topic of breaking up and he would redirect it, shame me for trying to do it over text or telling me that i wasn’t getting my point across. our break up culminated in one of the aforementioned 4 hour phone calls, followed by 3 months of self work and us trying to make it work again. it all kind of fell apart when i went on a road trip with my friends (that he knew was happening) and he called me and yelled at me because i wasn’t texting him back or wanting to talk about us, when in reality i was driving for about 6 hours with two other people in the car. after that he texted me and told me “i don’t want to hear from you until the end of next month” and it an act of defiance, i didn’t talk to him for a little over a year and he didn’t bother texting me either. 

Current situation:

about a year and a half ago, he sent a package to my parent’s house. this package was filled with things from our relationship, pottery i’d made him, poetry i’d written, pictures he’d drawn of me and… a usb filled to the brim of every picture i’d every sent him, including nudes. i wasn’t sure what the goal was but i took it from my parents and shoved it in the back of my book shelf. shortly after, he texts and asks if i got the package. i confirm and this opens the floodgates. he begins chatting with me like nothing had happened, sending memes etc. and i’ll admit, i was lulled into a false sense of security. we talk on and off for a few months, mainly just life check ins and then he tells me he’s in my city and he’d like to meet up. 

i tell him that we can go get a coffee or something and he tells me to give him my address so we can go from there. he ends up showing up to my house, i ask him where he would like to go and he states that he just wants to chill in the house. i’m extremely uncomfortable with this because if i’m in public, i can’t be put in an uncomfortable position and it is significantly harder to get someone out of your house then it is to just walk out of a cafe. however, i’m not a confrontational person so i let it go. over the next 6 hours that he sits in my house, he insists on holding hands, showing me the nudes of me he still has on his iPad and even grabbing me by the head and kissing me on the forehead even though i physically tried to pull away. it was overall, just an incredibly uncomfortable and violating experience.

but because i can’t shake the guilt surrounding my departure from our relationship, i continued giving him chances to find closure from what i had done. i kept talking to him and naturally these talk divulged into the hours long phone calls i was so familiar with. and all that frustration and anxiety from years ago just bubbled up and i began to remember why i wanted out in the first place. he began demanding apologies, which i happily gave. and then he wanted another apology and another and made claims that he didn’t think i deserved to get back with him (i didn’t want to) or that he just wanted his best friend back or that he thinks maybe one day we can get back together. it was all very confusing and my fuse seemed to shorten each time we talked. at one point i said to him “i don’t think i’m interested in continuing these conversations anymore, i really wish you the best.” and he told me it felt like the break up all over again and didn’t acknowledge it in any serious way. 

this kinda leads me to where i am now. i took a pretty big social break across the board, work keeps me busy (sometimes 6 days a week), i had a medical procedure and some complications, seasonal depression makes me pretty introverted. and because of that, i hadn’t talked to him in probably almost 2 months. he’d sent me texts asking if i wanted to have a call or when i wanted to talk again. but honestly my battery was shot from trying to keep myself going and the idea of having to talk to him on top of everything else made my chest get tight and my heart start racing. i just kind of realized how little stress i was under when i wasn’t talking to him. and i liked it. and for some reason that also made me feel guilty. 

today he sent me a message saying “you know this is considered ghosting, right? at this point, you’re just being mean” and at this point i don’t know if i care if i’m being mean and i don’t know if that makes me a bad person. it feels kind of good to prioritize my peace but i also don’t want to perpetuate any pain that he is already going through. 

i want to ghost because i feel like that is the easiest way out of the situation but i also know it’s not the most mature or fair to him. i am also wary of sending another message explaining that i’m not interested in talking to him because he doesn’t seem to take those at face value either. 

has anybody else had a problem unsticking themselves from an ex or maybe have advice for what i should do? am i being selfish? 

tldr; i dated a guy for 2 years and fell out of love with him due to depression and anxiety surrounding our relationship. he reappeared a year or so later, wanting to reconnect but interactions with him have been uncomfortable, violating and exhausting. i don’t want to cause him more pain because it is clear the break up is still sitting with him but i want out of this situation for my own sake. he never takes my mentions of cutting off communication at face value and i’m not sure how to remove myself with exacerbating his grief. 

any advice or criticism is appreciated,

1jhd1n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1jhd1n7/coffee_how_do_you_make_it/,Coffee - how do you make it?,"I love coffee and can handle a cup a day (until my stomach issues tell me to stop for a few weeks). 

A visitor wrecked my Mokka pot, and in hindsight I didn't like the effort it took to just make a cup every day. But Keurig is a no-go.

I used a $10 coffeemaker from walmart for years and I'm considering just going back to that and a metal reusable filter. Not a fan of the plastic but hey, it works. 

What do you think is the easiest way to make coffee? No taking things apart, the fewest steps involved in both making and cleaning...thoughts?

Ideally no plastic but if thats your suggestion ill take it.

Hello there, thank you for stopping by:

I’m a 38-year-old straight male looking for genuine friendship with room for intimacy if the connection and attraction are there. In my experience, relationships are built through clear communication, honesty, and reciprocity, and I strive to embody those values. In that spirit I will be upfront, I’m in a long-term, non-monogamous relationship, but any relationship I pursue here would be exclusive to me—no couples dynamics involved. I'm primarily interested in finding just one (mayyybe two) rock solid relationships to foster and build upon. I know that adult life gets busy so I want to give the right amount of attention to anyone I meet.

A bit about me:

Art & Creativity: I enjoy black-and-white photography and surrealist artists like Zdzisław Beksiński.

Movies & Music: I enjoy a wide range of films (a favorite is There Will Be Blood) and have been into metal for 25+ years—though I’m open to most genres outside of rap and country.

Reading & Philosophy: I’m an avid reader and enjoy both fiction and nonfiction. I have an affinity for both Greek and Eastern philosophy and I also dabble in reading some existentialism and transcendentalism.

Food & Travel: I love both and will frequently drive to other cities for a restaurant/food item I like or one that I haven't tried yet. I have a very adventurous palate for food and I'm always up for trying something new - so long as I know it won't kill me or make me sick.

Craftsmanship & Work: My current job is hands-on and trade-adjacent—I do a mix of groundskeeping, carpentry, construction, etc. and I am always researching new things to learn and improve on. My last long term career was as a craft coffee roaster.

Nerdy Pursuits: I play Magic: The Gathering with friends, D&D a couple of times a month, and have been into gaming since the Atari/NES days.

Fitness & Outdoors: I go to the gym three times a week for strength training and recently started jogging—I’m almost at the ""not sucking"" stage. I also enjoy being outside so nature walks, hiking and camping are a love of mine.


I tend to be candid and an open book, so if anything here sparks your interest, reach out—I’d love to chat. If things click, great! If not, no worries—I wish you the best either way.",2,1742662574.0,nonmonogamy,9,1.0,False

1jhcyf4,https://i.redd.it/96kc1nmfu9qe1.jpeg,Help!! Need advice! Please lol,"Hi! I have an at home espresso machine. (Profitec) though I find the steamed milk to be decent.

1jhcx3j,https://i.redd.it/tqnnryl4u9qe1.png,Suzune bench scene illustration,"Compared to her middle school days, Kushida felt that both she and those around her had grown considerably more mature.

Even so, she had been unable to release her frustrations lately.
When days continued without a way to vent, even pretending to smile became impossible.

“Ugh, so annoying.”

As she was leaving, she muttered this without hesitation upon spotting a certain presence—since there was no one around who would be troubled by hearing it.

That presence was Horikita, sitting on a bench with a gloomy expression, her head down.

It would have been easy to just walk past, but when Kushida stopped in front of her, Horikita slowly lifted her head.

“Kushida-san…?”

“Why the question mark? And don’t worry, I’m not gonna ask what you’re doing here. You’re just waiting around, hoping to run into Ayanokoji-kun by chance, right?”

“That’s not it.”

“Yeah, totally obvious. I mean, there’s literally no other reason. You’re just a ridiculously clingy girl.”

Having her intentions so easily seen through, Horikita averted her gaze.

“…Could you just leave me alone?”

“I’d love to, but I can’t ignore you when you’re sitting there looking so miserable.”

“If Horikitahas that kind of expression, it’s bound to affect the atmosphere, don’t you think?”

Having had her true nature exposed and forced to coexist with the person she disliked—Horikita—the only reason Kushida tolerated it was because Horikita was necessary for her to graduate in Class A. If someone as important as Horikita was weakened, it would lower their chances of success, something Kushida definitely did not welcome.

“You—”

Just as Horikita was about to say something, Kushida averted her gaze and focused on a presence approaching from behind.

Since they were on their way back to the dorms, a third-year Class D student, Ninomiya Yui, happened to pass by.

“Kushida-san, Horikita-san. Goodbye~”

“Ah, bye-bye, Ninomiya-san! Let’s hang out again sometime~”

Flashing a bright smile, Kushida kept it up until Ninomiya was out of earshot.

Horikita also remained considerate and waited in silence for a while.

“Are you really okay with this, Kushida-san? With Ayanokoji-kun transferring?”

“Okay? Of course not. Without Ayanokoji-kun, this flimsy class doesn’t stand a chance. My dream of graduating in Class A is as good as dead.

And on top of that, Ayanokoji-kun knows my true nature. It’s practically the same as that information being handed over to another class.

If he ever feels the need, he won’t hesitate—he might expose me at any moment.”

Horikita recalled her meeting with Ayanokoji after the opening ceremony.The behind-the-scenes dealings between Ayanokoji and Matsushita, along with their accomplishments, were exposed without any hesitation.

Kushida’s fears and predictions were half correct.

“Then why do you seem so calm?”

“If I didn’t at least pretend to be, I wouldn’t be able to handle it. Just like how I’m good at pretending to be a good person, I’m also good at pretending to be unfazed. Unlike a certain someone.”

As the conversation dragged on, Kushida took a sip of the café au lait she had planned to drink after getting home. The coffee’s aroma mixed with the sweetness as it slid down her throat.

“Ugh, so annoying. Can you do something about that face? You look even uglier than usual.”

“I think I’m acting normal.”

“If this is normal, then you’re seriously in bad shape.”

With an exasperated sigh, she was about to start walking again when she suddenly remembered something.

“You can mope around all you want, but can you do something about Ibuki?”

“…Now that you mention it, she’s been persistently contacting me lately.”

“Yeah, because you keep ignoring her, she’s been bugging me to treat her to food. I told her to just eat some wild vegetable set meal or something, but she keeps complaining. Feels like she’s gotten numb to the idea of paying for food after spending so much time eating decent meals for free.

”Until spring break ended, this routine had repeated more than half the week. But now, it had suddenly stopped, with over a week passing without any contact.

“Right now… sorry, but I don’t feel like doing anything.”

“It’s not like I expect you to cook or anything. Anyway, the special exam has already started, so let’s hurry up and figure something out. Think of a plan, okay? There’s no way we can afford to lose to a bottom-ranked class.”

“You say that so casually… Considering the difference in numbers, we’re at a disadvantage.”

“And? Even in that situation, isn’t it the class leader’s job to overcome it?”

It was a harsh demand, but in the next moment, Horikita realized that it was completely justified.

Choosing to stand at the top meant taking responsibility.

“You’re right… I suppose that’s how it should be.”

Kushida forcibly softened her expression, putting her mask back in place.

“Even knowing all this, you still can’t pull it off, huh? Well, I’m heading out. You can just wait here for Ayanokoji-kun to come back. Not that he’ll pay you any attention, though.”

Leaving those cold words behind, Kushida tightly gripped her cup and started walking away.

Horikita watched her back for a while, meaninglessly staring until she disappeared from view. Then, with a heavy sigh, she finally stood up.

Because the last words Kushida left behind… were undeniably true.“Waiting here like this, as if ambushing him… there’s no way he’d welcome that…”

I should have known that from the beginning, but Kushida’s words made me realize that I had been pretending to be someone I wasn’t.

Even so, I still couldn’t bring myself to move forward.

Because my feelings of wanting to see him weren’t a lie.

I wanted to look him in the eyes and have a proper conversation.

“Right now… that’s all I want…”

Apologizing in my heart to Kushida and my classmates, I decided to head back.

When I returned to my room, I collapsed onto my bed without even taking off my uniform.

My body felt heavy.

It wasn’t that I was feeling unwell.

But I had no energy.

“I should be thinking about strategies for the exam…”

As I lay there, staring blankly at the ceiling, my phone suddenly rang.

(Then its continue to the one Ibuki and Hirata calling.)",1,1742662441.0,SuzuneHorikitaFans,0,1.0,False

This program is really legit and a person with multiple TBIs I can vouch. This program really helped alot. Its completely free. You get treated like a person. 8 hours of therapy for 3 weeks is no joke and it can get some really good results if you actually work the program and can get a good cohort. The most part you are doing therapy solo head to toe. They knew about better headache medications and management than the VA compared to my location which is out here in Central TX. Other conditions the VA completely missed. They take any Active, Veterans and LEO/First Responders. Pre or Post 9/11, peace time or wartime, doesn't matter. If you had any type of head injury from serving your country or your community and have issues that the VA cannot address, maybe check this program out, you'll get results. You stay in luxury apartments while there, You more than likely will have a room mate but you get your whole room with everything furnished. Share a kitchen and common area. You get a weekly card for food. If you shop correctly or work with your room mate then you can really get some good food going. Its an easy walk from your room to clinic. The only issue I would say is, its next to a firehouse also a train station and that can get really loud randomly throughout the day and night. The rooms do have sound machines that can help drown that out. The kitchen for the most part is fully stocked with everything for cooking but food to cook is on you but you get the gift card. My kitchen even had a french press for coffee besides the drip coffee maker, its pretty nice setup. You get plenty of cleaning supplies to keep things clean. You get a washer and dryer, internet (decent speeds) and TV with the basic apps, no subscription apps active, you gotta have your own login for Netflix. You will either have a 9-5 day or 8-4 day, lunch mid day and some extra breaks scattered through the program. You get your whole week schedule ahead of time, so you know exactly what you will be doing all week. It is custom tailored program to your specific needs. You will be pressed to push through things so be prepared for that. If you came out of state like I did, I would recommend to not shop at the Giant grocery store by the apartments. Its ridiculous expensive compared to other grocery stores in the area. You got a WaWa, Honeygrow (sp), Burger King close by within walking distance. If you doordash or uber its located close to alot of good food and not too far from Philly. Check out the Reading Terminal / China Town and other historic American history sites like the Liberty Bell. If you can manage the train/uber yourself  or as a group there's alot to do and see. The medical grade massage chairs are located on the the first floor of the apartment building, take a left at the first floor elevator that goes to the rooms in the main entrance, keep following there's signs. The coffee machine is top notch also located on the first floor in the Tasting Room. If you have a service dog make sure it has the right credentials, there might be some issues with that like my room mate had. You're gonna love Bailey the clinics dog. Bang command was my favorite.

1jhcubu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1jhcubu/sore_itchy_butt_area_with_bowel_issues/,Sore / Itchy Butt Area with Bowel Issues,"So I went to a doctor a few weeks ago as I've had an on-off issue with a sore / itchy butt area, where it never feels like I've fully emptied my bowels and sometimes I get random constipation or loose stools.

He checked in there, didn't find anything, and my blood test came back perfect. He's referred me to a specialist, and the appointment isn't until November. With complete respect to the Canadian healthcare system, there's no f--ing way I'm waiting eight months to get this figured out.

So I come to you, Biohackers, to see if you could recommend any possible supplements / remedies I could try to perhaps not entirely cure but at least alleviate this issue.

One important addition: I had to go to the ER two years ago for a kidney issue, where I was given hydromorphone (opioid) and antibiotics. My ""theory"" is that my gut is still messed up from both of those, which is affecting my stools and therefore causing skin problems in ""that"" area. Again, just a theory.

A tad more info:

\- 35M, healthy weight (155lbs).

\- Exercise regularly.

\- 80% - 90% healthy diet. Try and stay as hydrated as possible. I think my fibre intake is decent - that doesn't seem to be doing anything though.

\- Don't smoke, don't do drugs.

\- If I said I was teetotal I'd be lying, however I seldom drink anymore.

\- I do consume caffeine (two cups of coffee a day). Don't touch energy drinks or any of that crap.

Appreciate any recommendations. Thanks.",2,1742662237.0,Biohackers,11,1.0,False
1jhct4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MPN/comments/1jhct4f/tell_us_your_diagnosis_story/,Tell Us Your Diagnosis Story,"Hey everybody - I thought it would be helpful for us to share our diagnosis stories as a resource for those going through the process. Later on, I'll sticky this as a megathread in the community highlights.        

* What prompted you to get tested for the mutations?
* What challenges did you meet along the way?
* What was your final diagnosis?   

Here's my story. 12 years to diagnosis so it's a doozy.    

I still have the 2009 handwritten note from my primary care physician that my blood test showed high platelets. I call this primary care physician the Magic Doctor because he would do a magic trick for his patients at every visit. I found it weird and awkward at the time, but it makes me laugh now. Anyway, he referred me to Hematologist #1.    

Hematologist #1 said, ""What are you doing here?"" I told him, I don't know, wasn't my idea, my doctor sent me. He said, ""I need to have a talk with your doctor about that."" He ran some blood tests - I have no idea which.    

The Magic Doctor ran another CBC, a bit higher, and sent me back to Hematologist #1. The same routine occurred.     

Then I was sent to him a third time. At this visit, I had my husband with me (so of course I was taken more seriously) and I asked him - what is the magic number? He said 600. (Btw, even though this was 2009, that wasn't following the WHO diagnostic criteria, it was 450 in the 2008 revision.)    

In 2009, there was zero info online about MPNs. At that time, MPNs had only been recently reclassified as a blood cancer, and the CalR mutation hadn't even been discovered yet. I think I was only able to find a couple people online with high platelets - but they had extreme thrombocytosis, like 2 million, and were getting plateletpheresis (removing platelets from the blood - btw, it doesn't work in the long run because in MPNs, your bone marrow cranks out a bunch more immediately). But when I saw their blood counts were that high, I thought: well I was told not to worry by a hematologist, and my count is only 500....So I promptly forgot about it.        

At every single annual physical I had, my CBC was done and my platelets were high. I had 2 subsequent primary care physicians. With both of them, I'd ask about the high platelets and they'd tell me - ""That's just the way you are."" The only medical record I have from this period is in 2017, my platelets were in the 600s.     

In 2017, I had total knee replacement surgery (TKR). TKR has a very high risk of blood clots. My platelets were in the 700s. Those pre-op reports are viewed by the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and other medical professionals and no one said a word to me about my platelets. Thank God I was given lovenox (blood thinner) after the surgery.    

Around that time - it's hard to pinpoint - I started having a lot of symptoms. I feel like my MPN reached some sort of tipping point. Like one year I was asymptomatic, and the next I had a boatload of symptoms. And they were debilitating. By far the worst was fatigue and headaches. I saw neurologists, a zillion physical therapists, pain management, acupuncture, you name it - nothing helped with the headaches. I never once complained about fatigue because I thought - what are they gonna do? Tell me to drink more coffee? My primary didn't know - and he was shocked when I told him about my symptoms later on.           

In 2019, I had a Patient Portal! After my annual physical, I looked at my CBC and my platelets were at 1,000 and some other blood counts were high too - hematocrit, basophils, monocytes. My primary had marked it as ""normal"". I wrote him a message in the portal and said, ""my platelets have never been so high, I think something is wrong."" He apologized to me for overlooking it and referred me to Hematologist #2.    

Hematologist #2 was my husband's oncologist. She ran the mutation test and it came back positive for JAK2. After that, she left her position and literally vanished. Didn't take another job, just disappeared. Weird.    

By this time, I've communicated with a Facebook group and was told to get an MPN Specialist, so I found one and made an appointment. In the meantime, I kept the appointment with Hematologist #2's replacement, Hematologist #3. Heme #3 wasn't too thrilled that I already had an appointment with the MPN Specialist, but I had so many questions. He told me I had ET. I asked him if I should have a bone marrow biopsy. He said no. (Wrong. ) I told him I was extremely tired and had lots of debilitating headaches. He told me that MPNs have no symptoms. (Wrong.) After he answered my questions, he'd say in a snarky tone: ""Why don't you ask Dr. \_\_\_ that?"" Turned out he'd done residency with her and I think he was jealous since she was in a much more prestigious hospital and position. Ironically, he's now the director of the cancer center at that local hospital.    

In 2020, I finally see my MPN Specialist. She did a bone marrow biopsy on the first visit. And she noted that my hematocrit was high (although it wasn't incredibly high and had only recently gotten high). I brought my husband to that visit too, and he told her how sick I was. I just expected not to be believed, but she believed me.      
  
Lo and behold, my BMB report comes back and my diagnosis is not ET - it's PV. My PV is weird and my platelets predominate. Because it took so long to get diagnosed, I'll never know whether I had ET that progressed to PV, or had PV all along. I'm in a clinical trial on the maximum dose of Jakafi which has more or less given me my life back, but my stubborn platelets remain in the 800s.    

All told, it was roughly 12 years from the first record of a high blood count to misdiagnosis to correct diagnosis. Fortunately, I'm an outlier when it comes to this. Most people on this sub are getting diagnosed fairly quickly (even if they don't see it that way).       
  
I asked my MPN Specialist - how could this happen? How could so many doctors miss this? She said, ""I don't know."" I started thinking a lot about it, and I realized - if it's one doctor, that's just an incompetent doctor - but when it's lots of doctors, it's a systemic problem. They don't know about MPNs. They don't know it was reclassified as cancer. They only worry when blood counts are low, not high. I have no way of changing how doctors think, but it occured to me that I could try to empower other patients. So this led to me becoming the mod here, writing the Wiki, and now the upcoming website. It's all just paying it forward. We have to have the knowledge. We have to advocate for ourselves.     

P.S. This is also why - unlike other medical subs - I allow diagnosis questions. I know they can be annoying, but I don't want this to happen to anyone else if I can help it. I try to answer every single one, whether I feel like it or not. ",4,1742662145.0,MPN,4,1.0,False

I am not sure if the last sentence of my bio is silly, but I've just noticed so many writers are bad public speakers and not sure if an agent would be more inclined to something like that? Happy to strike or rephrase.

\---------

Dear \[Agent\],



I am seeking representation for my upmarket speculative novel LONG AFTER THE THRILL, complete at 70,000 words. A black humor coming-of-middle-age story featuring an underachiever like MJ Wassmer’s *Zero Stars Do Not Recommend,* this novel also parallels the recent viral Instagram trend of getting coffee with your teenage self. 



Micah Morris is nearing 40 years old. He is an English and theater teacher feeling like a loser for working at the same high school he attended in his youth, where 20 years prior a school shooting handicapped his sister. This source of trauma is not revealed until later in the novel, like Jessica Knoll’s *Luckiest Girl Alive*. In the beginning of the novel Micah is a sardonic suicidal depressive, making droll observations in the classroom and about his own maligned mental health. One night he goes home to get blackout drunk and puts a gun in his mouth. It is only a cry for help but leads to surreal events, a la Matt Haig’s *The Midnight Library*. He returns to work the next day to find a golden doorway in the back of the school’s auditorium. On the other side of that golden doorway he discovers his energetic eighteen year old self.



Intercut with present day Micah’s dry-witted narrative, we are introduced to vignettes of Young Micah. Raised in a generation of participation trophies, he’s voted “most likely to go to Hollywood,” and constantly told he has lots of promise and a bright future, enough to believe it might be true. His zeal for life and optimism strongly juxtapose the elder Micah’s pessimism, but as the novel approaches the school shooting in Young Micah’s timeline, in the time-hopping style of *Memento*, we see how the two disparate characterizations of the same person coalesce.



Meanwhile, behind the golden doorway in alternating scenes, Young Micah and elder Micah wax poetic, elder Micah hesitant to reveal the school shooting in spring of 2005 to his young self, which he believes changed him irrevocably**.** Eventually he realizes that maybe if he can stop that tragedy, his current life might be magically fixed**.** A plan is hatched to correct the past, but it is badly bungled. However, this bungling leads to the elder Micah stopping another shooting in the present timeline, during the opening night of a play he is directing as the theater teacher. Hailed as a hero, he realizes the past can’t be changed, but his attitude about the future can. He stops drinking and begins a path of healing.



LONG AFTER THE THRILL is an exploration of identity, regret, and the moments that define us; it attempts to deliver a meditation on what it means to face your younger self and discover you're both the hero and the person who needs saving.



I am a Colorado author whose short fiction has appeared in speculative fiction magazines including *Mirror Dance* and *Twisted Tongue*, as well as a repeated finalist for NYC Midnight fiction competitions. Like Micah, in real life I am also an actor with several IMDb credits and comfortable with public speaking.



Thank you for your consideration!

1jhcgur,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jhcgur/from_rejection_to_redemption/,From rejection to redemption,"The day I turned 18, everything changed. It wasn’t the usual joy of hitting adulthood, the excitement of newfound freedom. No, it was the day my dad, in a moment of anger and frustration, told me to leave.

I remember the words like they were carved into my soul: “You’re 18 now. You’re no longer a child. Pack your things and get out.” It stung more than anything he had ever said to me before. I had expected advice, encouragement, or maybe even a celebratory dinner. Instead, I was given a one-way ticket to the real world.

The months that followed were brutal. I had no idea how to navigate life alone. My friends offered couches to crash on, but I knew I couldn’t rely on them forever. I needed to prove to myself — and to him — that I could make it.

I worked odd jobs, washed dishes in the back of restaurants, and flipped burgers just to survive. But even in the toughest times, something inside me burned with a determination that kept me going. I couldn’t let his rejection define me. I had to show him I could rise above it.

It was in a tiny, run-down coffee shop on a rainy Tuesday that the idea hit me. I had been sketching business plans on napkins for months, trying to figure out how I could build something real. I had always been good with tech and problem-solving, and I saw an opportunity in a market few had tapped into: custom software solutions for small businesses. They were always behind the curve, struggling with outdated systems and inefficient operations. I could help.

I borrowed a few hundred dollars from a friend, bought a used laptop, and started working out of my cramped apartment. Every day was a grind. I spent countless hours learning, coding, and pitching ideas to anyone who would listen. My first client came through a random online ad, a small local store looking to streamline their operations. It wasn’t much, but it was the beginning of something bigger.

Years went by. I kept grinding, building my reputation, and expanding my reach. Word-of-mouth helped me land bigger clients, and eventually, my small startup turned into a thriving business. By the time I was 28, I had my own office, a growing team, and contracts with major corporations. My business was making millions — a success I could hardly have dreamed of back when I was sleeping on friends' couches.

And then, ten years after my 18th birthday, it happened. My doorbell rang one cold, rainy evening. I opened the door, and there he was: my dad, standing there in an old, worn-out jacket, his face flushed with embarrassment.

""Can we talk?"" he asked, his voice shaky.

I didn’t know what to say at first. Part of me wanted to slam the door, to tell him to get lost, to remind him of how he’d cast me aside on the day I needed him most. But something else in me, something I couldn’t quite explain, softened. After all these years, was I really willing to hold onto the bitterness?

""Come in,"" I said, stepping aside.

We sat in silence for a few minutes before he finally spoke again. “I was wrong. I shouldn’t have kicked you out. I see now that I pushed you too far, and I’m sorry.”

He looked down, a rare moment of vulnerability from the man who had always prided himself on being tough and unshakeable. ""I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. I saw what you built, and I realized that I couldn’t have been more wrong about you. I thought you’d fail without me, but I see now that you were always stronger than I gave you credit for.""

I could feel the weight of the years between us, the years of hurt and resentment that had built up, but I also felt something else: a strange sense of peace. Maybe forgiveness wasn’t for him. Maybe it was for me.

""I appreciate you saying that,"" I replied. ""But honestly, I’m not sure I can forget how you treated me back then. You pushed me away when I needed you most, and it hurt. But what I did after... that was for me. Not to prove a point to you, but to prove to myself that I could stand on my own two feet.""

He nodded slowly, understanding the depth of my words. ""I’m sorry. I should have been better. You deserved better.”

We sat there for a long time, the silence no longer uncomfortable. My father didn’t try to justify himself, and I didn’t need an apology that fixed everything. All I needed was for him to admit the truth: he had been wrong. And he had.

That night, as he left, he said, ""I don’t expect you to forgive me right away, but I hope, one day, we can start again.""

Maybe we could. Maybe the past couldn’t be erased, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t a future to build. With or without him, I had learned that my success was my own — but perhaps there was room for healing too.

**SCRIPT:**



I had a dream last night.

You opened your eyes, and you sat up in your bed. You saw me and you smiled. You reached out to brush aside the hair that’d fallen in front of my eyes. And I...I didn’t protest this time. Do you remember the first time you tried to do that? I almost broke your wrist. (A small chuckle)

Sorry about that, by the way. You were just so- so full of yourself! You were just a merchant- a commoner- strutting around the palace like you owned it. I wanted to wipe away that cocky smile from your face so, so badly! (Smiling faintly) Going out of your way to flirt with a royal knight every chance you got- the sheer audacity...

You’re lucky to be such a close friend of the crown prince. Or else I’d have done so much worse. (Whispering, unsure) I think...hm...perhaps not.

You apparently saved his life once. Beats me to this day how exactly you did such a thing, so you’ll forgive me if I still have my reservations...but the prince trusts you. And I think I understand why.

*(SFX: Night breeze and wind chimes)*

Please, wake up.

Your face looks so peaceful. So soft in the moonlight. Can you hear me...? Can you dream...? Can you feel my hand?

My little sparrow. I miss you.

I went to the training grounds this morning, you know? It was mostly empty. For the first time in a long time, I picked up my old sword, and I practised swinging. Practised my stance, footwork, feints and jabs and parries, slashed at the empty air. And every once in a while, I turned around to look at the pavilion. Expecting to find you there, with that annoying little smirk on your face. Checking me out while I was training, for heaven’s sake! (Sighing)

You always showed up to flirt during practice. Like clockwork. And I know I just rolled my eyes and ignored you, but I...I promise not to do that now. So, if I go to the training grounds again tomorrow, do you- (voice breaking a little) – do you think you could come visit me?

Please?

I’m sorry for bruising your wrist. Okay, not really (a tiny snicker). That’s what you get for trying to touch a woman you don’t even know. But then, what you said afterwards as you lay wincing on the ground, struck me. You said you knew me. You used to brush aside my hair all the time.

My little sparrow. I can’t even imagine how you must have felt. Coming to see me everyday, hoping I’d recognise you, but I- I just couldn’t remember who you were. Can you ever forgive me?

You told me on that night, while I was rubbing your wrist with ointment. In your chambers, in the soft glow of the oil lamp. The corridors and hallways of this palace were hushed, silent, sleeping. There was only the sound of rain, falling over the naked world outside. And that’s when it clicked.

You had changed so much. Your hair was wild and unruly. There was this- this strange wisdom in your eyes. Only seen in the eyes of one who has travelled far and wide, witnessed humanity at its very best, and at its worst. And indeed, you told me you’d been travelling for a long time. You became a merchant after your family moved away, and then years later, when you found yourself in the old kingdom, you decided to come visit. You followed the same dusty trail, the same fading cobblestones where we’d once played as children, my darling.

You heard from one of the locals that I was a knight of the royal crown now. And that- apparently- was enough reason for you to start living here. Your friend, the prince, was trying to play matchmaker between us, wasn’t he? You two concocted such silly, elaborate schemes. Like something out of a romance novel. (Sighing) I don’t understand why it never dawned on you guys to simply tell me the truth.

*(SFX: Soft hair brushing for a while, as she speaks)*

I don’t know how I failed to recognise you, little sparrow. Your smile, it- it should’ve told me everything. But here we are. At least your wrist has healed up. And I-

I still love you.

*(Gently kissing the listener)*

I never forgot you. I’m sorry for making you feel like you were all alone. You’re not. I’m going to be with you until the very end, alright? I’m not leaving your side. And I won’t cry. I won’t. I promised myself I wouldn’t cry. So please, just- just open your eyes. Look at me. Look.

(Breathing heavily, trying to calm herself)

I’m still wearing that pendant you gave me. The memory shard is glowing especially bright tonight. Do you know what I see in the glass?

It’s that sparrow. He has returned. And we’re sitting on the bench by the lake, and I point out how much the bird reminds me of you, and you’re shaking your head inside the memory. And then I call you sparrow, and you hate it. So I decide to keep calling you that. (Giggling, despite herself)

You’re as cute as that bird. Just as curious. And wise. Full of stories. And...and fragile. Like the bird. You make me want to protect you. To care for you.

But that has never stopped you before. You always accompanied me on my campaigns. Insisted on riding with me and sharing a tent with me and- and just worrying me to death! It wasn’t safe for you. What do you think I’d have done if you got hurt?!

(Quietly) I was always going to come back to you. Was that never enough?

Your face still looks so peaceful. Unchanging. But I can tell what you’re thinking. What you want to ask me.

No. I’m not mad. I’m happy you were by my side on all those long and cold nights away from home. Earlier, before you came back into my life, I’d sometimes lie there on my bed in the dark, unable to sleep, and try to remember your face. The sound of your voice. Try to imagine where you were and what you were doing in that moment. Were you with someone else? Did she make you happy? And did you...did you still remember me, my sparrow?

But there you were. Pressed up into me, snoring away softly. I could smile now, and nuzzle you back. I could never tell you how much you meant to me. How much you still mean to me.

You used to tell me stories on some of those nights. Stories of kings and queens, dragons and sea monsters, of forgotten worlds and charming little coffee shops. You used to sell stories as a merchant. Some of them, I suspect, you’d written yourself. And you always had a gift for magic. The scenes and characters in those books came alive. People could hear and feel what they were reading, almost like they were inside. I used to love it when you shared your stories with me.

I didn’t want to push you away. I really didn’t. But you always put yourself in danger for me, and it was my fault. You loved me too much, and it- it scared me. I am the commander of the twelfth regiment. A knight handpicked by Her Late Majesty. I can’t mix duty with love...muddle allegiance with affection.

Or so I thought.

After the incident, we agreed to remain friends. I needed you in my life, but I couldn’t let you get hurt anymore. It...it doesn’t matter what we are. You still are my best friend. As long as you were safe, and still a part of my world, I could be happy. I could be happy. I could be...I- I was wrong.

I was wrong.

My sparrow, I should never have ended things. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I was the one who ended up hurting you the most. You found me after so long. And it was blissful. It was a dream. Why’d I have to wake up? Why...why’d I have to break your heart?

(Quietly, solemnly) The glass is changing. Look, my darling. The pendant feels so heavy around my neck as I’m reliving my memories.

It’s a picture of your room. The oil lamp by your desk is still burning. This- this is from a month ago. I didn’t know what to say. I could tell it hurt you just to look at me. Your eyes change when you’re in pain.

I was about to leave when you stopped me. And you told me the story of how this world came to be. Do you remember?

There was nothing in the beginning. Just a great tree in the middle of a dark plain. No stars in the sky. No cicadas in the field. Just the tree, and silence.

After a long time, a boy came along and found the tree. He knelt before the tree and closed his eyes, bringing his hands together as if in prayer. And then, suddenly, lightning fell from the sky and struck the tree seven times.

On the first, the sun began to burn. On the second, the moon began to shine. The third, the oceans of the world began to churn. The fourth, a sapling emerged out of the soil. The fifth made the clouds, and made them rain. The sixth gave rise to all the stars of the universe, and on the seventh, a heartbeat.

The boy heard a heartbeat, different from his own. He opened his eyes and found a girl sitting in front of him, staring at him all puzzled. The boy blinked.

Now, there were two.

There- there still are two. Isn’t that right...my little sparrow?

Don’t leave me.

You have always been there for me. You have always helped me walk when I stumbled, made me smile when all I wanted to do was bury my face into the pillow.

You said you’d always be with me. No matter what.

(Kissing the listener softly) You liar.

You pushed me out of the way and took the curse upon yourself. You knew there was no coming back. I should never have let the prince convince me into letting you tag along like old times.

All I wanted to do was protect you. But in the end, it has always been you protecting me. Why could you not have fallen for a nice, normal girl, my sweet? Why’d you have to perch on the palm of my hand, little sparrow?

(Breathing audibly, up close)

You look like you’re going to wake up any minute now. You’re breathing like you’re just asleep. Your hand feels warm. I can hear your heartbeat. But this- this is the seventh night I’ve come to see you, and you still haven’t woken up. The physicians said you’ll not be returning from the world of dreams. Because it’s a much nicer world than here.

I know magic too. And I know this curse won’t lift. You won’t be waking up. This- this is the seventh night, and this is the last time I come to see you. I won’t be visiting you anymore. I can’t keep doing this. It’s more than I can bear. I’m sorry.

(Breathing unsteadily) I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry.

(Calming herself) I...I wish to give you a gift. Since I won’t be seeing you anymore. It’s not much, but it’s all I can give you right now.

I’m going to give you my life.

*(SFX: Wind chimes ringing in the wind)*

I know magic too. It takes a curse to undo a curse. A soul, for a soul. I know you understand, even if you might not accept it.

Well, my darling...you don’t get a say in it. I don’t want to live in a world without you. So, you’ll just have to keep living on my behalf, alright?

You have to live. You have so many stories you still have to write. You can’t die. I won’t let you die. I love you.

I’ll love you in every world. My little sparrow. (Pecking the listener’s forehead)

I...I...(trying to breathe)...I’m going to start the spell now, okay?

(Whispering solemnly) You winds that hear my will, carry my words into the depths of the earth. Into the frozen realm. Let her hear it. Let the Lady see the signs I weave into the air with these hands. The invisible sigils I trace. Let her see. For I know she’s too cruel to be blind.

(Quietly) But you claim to be impartial, don’t you? Lady Death? Then take the trade. These night winds on which I whisper, they bear witness to my will. I give you my soul, in exchange for his.

Take it.

*(SFX: Wind chimes ringing a little louder. Strong winds.)*

(Sighing, almost happily) It’s done, my dearest. Soon, you’ll open your eyes. Do you mind if I lie beside you until then? I can feel my hands turning the faintest bit of cold. My eyes getting just a little heavier.

*(SFX: Soft rustling of bedsheets)*

The spell takes a while to complete. You don’t mind if I hold for a little while, right?

(Speaking softly, tiredly, almost exhausted)

You feel so good in my arms. I’ve been wanting to do this again for a long time now.

I said I’d stay with you until the very end, didn’t I? I’m sorry. It seems...I am a liar too.

Hey, sparrow, will you make me a promise?

When you wake up, and find me sleeping beside you, could you please not cry?

I’m afraid it’ll rain inside my dreams if you do. It’ll just remind me of the first night I spent in your room. And then...and then I’ll feel sad.

I don’t want you to see me sad. I want the two of us to always be smiling in my dream.

Don’t cry, alright? I...I won’t be there to wipe away your tears this time.

Sparrow...? Did you- did you just squeeze my hand?

*(SFX: Rustling of sheets)*

I...it’s getting harder to keep my eyes open. But you’re not supposed to wake up until I’m gone. I- am I already imagining things?

That...that must be it, isn’t it? I’m just tired.

Yeah. That must be it...

My sparrow? You- you did it again.

Are your lips twitching? I can’t see. I- I’m so tired, but I-

Darling? Is that you? Are you...giving me a sign?

I can’t tell if you’re starting to wake up on your own. Or if it’s just the spell already taking effect. Or- or if this is even real.

You want me to stop the spell, don’t you? That’s why...you...you’re doing this...why you’re trying so hard to...

I want to stop it too. I don’t want to go. I...don’t want...to go...my darling.

I want to be here when you open your eyes. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t- I don’t know what to do.

My little sparrow...I...

What do I do?

You ever wake up and realize you don’t want to be awake? Like life is just a crappy, unskippable ad for ED, the remote’s broken, and I’m a WOMAN? Yeah.

Welcome to depression, folks—the only mental illness where people who’ve never had it are the experts, telling you to cheer up like you just forgot to put sugar in your coffee.

“Oh, you’re depressed? Have you tried going outside?” Yeah, genius, that’s the problem! I went outside, and I saw people! And they mostly weren’t great!

And let’s talk about people, shall we? You ever just look around and think, “Wow, this species was a mistake”? We had to create a myth of bespoke Divine creation just to make ourselves feel special—and that’s a deity we claim to respect!

We’ve got billionaires hoarding enough money to end world hunger, but nah, they’d rather build rocket ships so they can have a better view while we all burn. (Ooh, aaah, pretty colors!)

We’ve got politicians force feeding us nonsense and corporations using child labor to slap rainbows and trees on their products while they dump poison in the water.

And the real kicker? Nobody cares.

People scream about it online for five minutes, accuse each other of making stuff up, then click over to TikTok to watch folks in scrubs dancing through a code blue.

And oh, the futility. Every day, we get fed the same motivational nonsense: “You matter! You can change the world!”

The world’s not changing; it’s circling the drain.

You ever try your best, put in real effort, and still get crushed by life like a bug on a windshield? That’s every single day.

Work hard? Get nowhere.

Play fair? Get played.

Speak the truth? Get shut down.

But no, no, it’s all in my head, right? Maybe if I just thought more positively, I wouldn’t feel like Sisyphus with a boulder-sized to-do list, where everything’s due yesterday!

”Have you tried gratitude?"" Yeah, I did, and guess what? The universe is still awful! Thanks for nothing.

And the worst part? The real insult? The good ones leave, and the worst people stick around. The sweetest, kindest souls get chewed up and spat out, while the selfish climb the ladder like it’s an escalator.

And you know who never judged me? My dog. My dog thought I was a hero. I wish I were half the person my dog thought I was.

What I'm Looking For: I’m looking for someone who appreciates quiet moments, values vulnerability, and doesn’t mind the occasional silence. If you’re the type who enjoys meaningful, calm dates like visiting a museum, stargazing, or grabbing coffee at a local spot, then we might just click. Bonus points if you like sports! I’m all about finding someone who understands the beauty of small, quiet moments together.
Fun Facts:

1jhcafw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/comments/1jhcafw/ghsv1_1_month_post_diagnosis/,GHSV-1: 1 month post diagnosis,"Hey everyone! Male (27) here! Had my first outbreak a month ago after receiving oral from a girl who I met, no fs only oral(just my luck). Had my initial outbreak 5 days later. It was so sudden because I didn’t get any other symptoms. No swollen lymph nodes, no fever, flu-like symptoms, hell no blister even. It was a small single ulcer that I originally thought was balanitis related that I discovered in the shower after a soccer game,but I went in to get tested because of the recent encounter. The doc swabbed it and even he couldn’t really pinpoint it because it was so small under the foreskin (frenulum area). Anyways, came back positive and literally cleared up within 7 days. Really no bother because it was small but it did sting when I wanted to clean the under foreskin area. That being said, I have a few questions.

Did anyone else get such mild symptoms that could’ve easily been mistaken for something else? I typically hear that although ghsv1 is more mild in terms of recurrent outbreaks and shedding, I usually see that many people have a rather bad initial one. Would this also be an indication that because my immune system handled it rather well, that my future outbreaks will be even more mild? I ask because like I said, I see people say “first outbreak was like 10 blisters, second more mild with 5 blisters, third outbreak was 3, etc” so would it typically present itself like that? I guess I was a bit lucky and unlucky on where it was because it was easily concealed under my foreskin and I didn’t really have to worry about touching it unless I pulled the foreskin back to clean it. Also unlucky cause the frenulum area is so sensitive so I’m still being very gentle with masturbation as a result lol anyone else get similar initial outbreaks? And if so, how are your recurrences/or lack thereof.

Also a huge thing I have had on my mind is lifestyle changes. To be honest, in this month I have still been living life as usual. Usually go out drinking once a week(2-3 drinks) so well in moderation in my opinion. Still drinking coffee, usually one night a week where I go out and stay late, but I do get to sleep in the next day. Anyways, I have tried to do that because my logic is, if ghsv1 is considered more mild than oral hsv1, yet they go out and live their life, why shouldn’t I? Would you guys(from your experience) agree that we really dont have to change much in our daily lives/consumption? I know folks with hsv2 unfortunately do have to make such changes because of the nature of the virus, but I have seen Terri Warren say that for gshv1 we really dont have to worry about those things as much because its so benign? Would you agree? I do have two trips coming up and I hear people say that traveling causes outbreaks but I’m not sure if they have hsv2 or 1, so a bit anxious about that. Idk I kinda tell myself that if I pretend its not there and I dont hyper focus on it, then I’ll be fine. But I kinda wanna know where that “line” is.

Compared to her high school days, Kushida felt that both she and those around her had matured considerably.

Even so, lately she was unable to vent her frustrations.
When the days went on without a way to vent, even faking a smile became impossible.

""Ugh, so annoying.""

As she left, she muttered this without hesitation upon spotting a certain presence, as there was no one around who would mind hearing it.

That presence was Horikita, sitting on a bench with a somber expression and her head bowed.

It would have been easy to pass her by, but when Kushida stopped in front of her, Horikita slowly raised her head.

""Kashida-san...?""

""Why the question mark? And don't worry, I'm not going to ask you what you're doing here. You're just waiting, hoping to bump into Ayanokoji-kun by chance, aren't you?""

""It's not that.""

""Yeah, totally obvious. I mean, there's literally no other reason. You're a ridiculously clingy girl.""

Seeing through her intentions so easily, Horikita averted her gaze.

""...Would you leave me alone?""

""I'd love to, but I can't ignore you when you're sitting there looking so miserable.""

""If Horikita has that kind of expression, it's sure to affect the atmosphere, don't you think?""

Having had her true nature exposed and forced to coexist with the person she disliked—Horikita—the only reason Kushida tolerated it was because Horikita was necessary for her to graduate from Class A. If someone as important as Horikita weakened, her chances of success would decrease, something Kushida definitely didn't welcome.

""You...""

Just as Horikita was about to say something, Kushida averted her gaze and focused on a presence approaching from behind.

As they were heading back to the dorms, a third-year student from Class D, Ninomiya Yui, passed by.

""Kushida-san, Horikita-san. Goodbye~""

""Ah, goodbye, Ninomiya-san! Let's meet again sometime~""

Giving a bright smile, Kushida maintained it until Ninomiya was out of earshot.

Horikita also remained considerate and waited for a moment in silence.

""Are you really okay with this, Kushida-san? With Ayanokoji-kun's transfer?""

""Okay? Of course not. Without Ayanokoji-kun, this puny class doesn't stand a chance. My dream of graduating from Class A is as good as dead.

And on top of that, Ayanokoji-kun knows my true nature. It's practically the same as if that information were passed on to another class.

If he ever feels the need, he won't hesitate: he could expose me at any time.""

Horikita recalled her encounter with Ayanokoji after the opening ceremony.

The backroom dealings between Ayanokoji and Matsushita, along with their accomplishments, were exposed openly.

Kushidada's fears and predictions were half-correct.

""So why do you seem so calm?""

""If I didn't at least pretend to be, I wouldn't be able to handle it. Just as I'm good at pretending to be a good person, I'm also good at pretending to be unfazed. Unlike a certain someone.""

As the conversation dragged on, Kushida took a sip of the latte she'd planned to have when she got home. The aroma of the coffee mingled with the sweetness as it slid down her throat.

""Ugh, how tiresome. Can you do something about that face? You're even uglier than usual.""

""I think I'm acting normal.""

""If this is normal, then you're seriously messed up.""

With an exasperated sigh, he was about to start walking again when he suddenly remembered something.

""You can mope all you want, but can you do something about Ibuki?""

""...Now that you mention it, she's been contacting me insistently lately.""

""Yeah, since you keep ignoring her, she's been nagging me to treat her to lunch. I told her to have some wild greens dish or something, but she keeps complaining. It seems she's grown numb to the idea of ​​paying for food after spending so much time eating decent meals for free.""

Until spring break was over, this routine had been repeated for more than half the week. But now, it had suddenly stopped, with more than a week going by without any contact.

""Right now... I'm sorry, but I just don't feel like doing anything.""

""It's not like I expect you to cook or anything. Anyway, the special exam has already started, so let's hurry up and think of something. Come up with a plan, okay? There's no way we can afford to lose to a poorly ranked class.""

""You say that so lightly... Considering the difference in numbers, we're at a disadvantage.""

""So? Even in that situation, isn't it the class leader's job to overcome it?""

It was a harsh demand, but in the next moment, Horikita realized...She realized she was completely justified.

Choosing to be at the top meant taking responsibility.

""You're right... I guess that's how it should be.""

Kushida forcibly softened her expression, pushing her mask back into place.

""Even knowing all this, you still can't make it, huh? Well, I'm off. You can wait here for Ayanokoji-kun to return. Not that I'll be paying any attention to you, though.""

Leaving those cold words behind, Kushida gripped her cup tightly and began to walk away.

Horikita watched his back for a while, staring blankly into space until he disappeared from her sight. Then, with a heavy sigh, she finally stood up.

Because Kushida's last words... were undeniably true.

""Waiting here like this, as if we were ambushing him... there's no way he'd be okay with it...""

I should have known from the start, but Kushida's words made me realize I'd been pretending to be someone I wasn't.

Still, I didn't dare go through with it.

Because my feelings of wanting to see him weren't a lie.

I wanted to look him in the eye and have a proper conversation.

""Right now... that's all I want...""

Apologizing in my heart to Kushida and my classmates, I decided to go back.

When I returned to my room, I collapsed onto the bed without taking off my uniform.

My body felt heavy.

It wasn't that I felt sick.

But I had no energy.

""I should be thinking about strategies for the exam...""


________________________________________
Horikita arrived home and flopped down on her bed without taking off her clothes.

The phone rang. It was Ibuki. She didn't answer.

I tried, but it rang again. It was a text message from Hirata, who wanted to talk about the special test.

Horikita began to miss Kiyo and cried unconsciously, even crying out loud.

She wanted to go back to the first day of school, but realized Kiyo had already made up his mind, and going back to the first day of school would be useless.

""Help me.""

""Ayanokouji-kun.""

""Help me--""

This is a long info-dump; feel free to skip around for parts that are most relevant to you, but DO NOT skip the following disclaimer:

**Disclaimer**: I am not a doctor or medical practitioner. I'm just a very curious Auvelity user who also has an unfortunately large amount of experience talking with psychiatrists about medications because of my kids mental health journeys as well as my own. Some of this may be wrong; if you believe that please comment and correct. I'll try to be clear about what is my conjecture vs what I've heard from psychiatrists or other reputable sources.

Also: it may be that you are being prescribed Auvelity despite being at higher risk of various side effects because your provider considers that the side effects may be the ""lesser of two evils"". **Especially if you have a complex psychiatric history**, take what you are reading here with a grain of salt. Your psychiatric provider knows your background far better than an Internet rando like me and may be making judgement calls that are right for your specific situation despite some potential downsides.

My purpose in sharing this is to equip you with more understanding that can help you have a better informed conversation with your psychiatric provider. **DO NOT stop taking or change how you take Auvelity without talking with your doctor first**.

# Auvelity basics

Most of the following information is sourced from [this blog article](https://www.cafermed.com/post/auvelity), written by a well known medical textbook author Dr. Cafer. If the style seems a bit strange, it's because his textbooks are written to include a lot of mnemonics to help medical school students memorize things.

Auvelity is the newest antidepressant on the market, approved in the US in 2022. It was approved under the ""breakthrough therapy"" designation, which typically happens when preliminary testing shows such a positive benefit and lack of risks that the FDA believes it would cause more harm to wait to approve it than to go through the full clinical trial regimen. Do not worry about this from a safety perspective: the two active components of Auvelity have been widely used for decades.

The primary active component of Auvelity is Dextromethorphan (found in many over the counter cold medications, at least in the US). For the rest of this post, I'll be abbreviating Dextromethophan as DXM.

DXM is an ""NDMA antagonist"" which means that, when active, it blocks activity for the NDMA receptor found in neurons. Ketamine is also a (much stronger) NDMA antagonist, leading to Auvelity's nickname of ""Ketamine in a pill"" (although to be perfectly clear, Ketamine has other effects as well and Auvelity is not a strict replacement).

However, Auvelity also contains Bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin), which alters DXM metabolism. Without going into a great deal of detail (partially because this will come up later in the side effects section), DXM is normally rapidly metabolized by your body, breaking down into other substances. Bupropion blocks the primary method of metabolism, resulting in greater concentrations of DXM remaining in your neurons for longer, enabling it to have effects that it normally doesn't. This is the primary reason Bupropion (which also is an antidepressant in its own right) is in Auvelity.

Between the DXM and the Bupropion, Auvelity alters availability of the neurotransmitters glutamate, serotonin, and norepinephrine, with a  mild effect on dopamine (the latter two are from bupropion). This makes it a bit of an ""all-in-one"" compared to other psychiatric medications which typically only target one (like widely used SSRIs).

Besides this sort of ""all in one"" quality, the other really positive aspect of Auvelity is how quickly it works. SSRIs take weeks to reach effectiveness. Many patients see positive effects from Auvelity in days. This is a game changer for clinical treatment of major depressive disorder.

# Switching to Auvelity

If you are changing from another psychiatric medication, it may be hard to tell which side effects are due to Auvelity vs which are from weaning off another med. This is one of the best reasons to follow the common advice here to ""stick it out for a few weeks"". MANY psychiatric drugs kind of suck to come off of for some people and in my experience this is something that psychiatrists can fail to warn about or have detailed discussions about. But don't just suck it up: talk to your practitioner and have a detailed discussion about exactly what you are feeling rather than just assuming root cause.

# Anxiety and Auvelity

The Bupropion in Auvelity increases the amount of norepinephrine, which is involved in the ""fight or flight response"" and is also increased by stimulants. A psychiatrist has told me that as a result, Bupropion is not typically prescribed to patients with major anxiety disorder, because it can make anxiety worse.

If you have panic attacks already, it would be appropriate to ask your provider about why they are recommending Auvelity given this potential issue. If you experience a spike in anxiety that doesn't feel manageable after starting Auvelity, talk to your provider ASAP, and don't try to ""wait it out"", unless they recommend doing so.

# Auvelity and Bipolar disorder

Auvelity increases serotonin, which can provoke mania in people with bipolar disorder; as a result, it is not recommended in the case of bipolar depression (this is part of the Auvelity fact sheet, and is also mentioned in the blog I linked above in in the Auvelity basics section). It is very unlikely that your provider will prescribe Auvelity if you have a bipolar diagnosis; if they do, make sure to ask about it.

If you don't have a bipolar diagnosis but suddenly start feeling an intense surge of energy and euphoria, racing thoughts, irritability and / or less need for sleep, you may be having a manic episode and probably aren't going to be searching the Internet for side effect information! However, if you do see this and are experiencing those symptoms, this is an emergency and you should get in touch with your doctor immediately.

# Auvelity and sleep / ADHD

Because of the action on nerepinephrine, Auvelity can behave in some ways like a stimulant, which can mess up your sleep (I've heard this from multiple psychiatrists both about Auvelity and Bupropion). This is the reason for the normal dosing schedule to be first thing in the morning, and then (after acclimation) a second dose 8 hours later. This gives the medication enough time to wear off for you to be able to sleep in the evening. If you are on two pills / day and take Auvelity late, don't be surprised if your sleep is disrupted; the timing is pretty important.

Having said that, my personal experience is that when taking bupropion or Auvelity with appropriate timing, my sleep quality actually increases. I'm less wakeful, and according to my Apple Watch, I'm getting more REM sleep. If you are taking Auvelity and are timing the pills correctly and feel it's messing up your sleep, definitely talk with your doctor about it.

Now, you may be reading this and scratching your head because there are people on here that take Auvelity at night to avoid some of the other side effects. Everyone is different. However, it's important to realize that people with ADHD react to stimulants quite differently than the rest of us (heard from a psychiatrist, generally well known). Bupropion is used sometimes to help with ADHD. I'm wondering / conjecturing if the people who are able to sleep well while taking Auvelity at night might have ADHD. In any case, don't assume that taking Auvelity at night is something that will work well for you despite positive testimonials here.

# Auvelity and SSRIs

SSRIs (Selective Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitors) are the most widely used class of antidepressants, including drugs like Fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), and paroxetine (Paxil). According to the fact sheet, because Auvelity also increases serotonin levels, you are at increased risk for ""serotonin syndrome"" taking it along side an SSRI, which can be life threatening.

However, as with most things medical, ""increased risk"" doesn't mean it definitely will happen, and if your Dr. is prescribing both it's likely that they are weighing that risk or know that your current SSRI dose isn't high enough for the interaction to cause problems. Things to look out for: agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, dilated pupils, sweating, shivering, diarrhea, and muscle twitching. Talk with them if you are on both and find out what they are thinking about this issue.

# Sexual side effects

Like other medications which increase seratonin, some people who take Auvelity may experience a reduction in libido or have other problems with sex. One of the more frequent versions of this mentioned here is an inability to climax. This is something that may get better in a 2-3 month timeframe, and if it does not, is treatable in other ways (heard from a psychiatrist).

**If you are experiencing this, don't be embarrassed**; your psychiatrist is a medical professional and is used to talking frankly about sensitive topics like this and will likely be glad that you bring it up... many patients don't and suffer in silence or discontinue an otherwise-beneficial drug unnecessarily. It's worth noting that bupropion is one of the medications that can help with sexual side effects from SSRIs, so just because an SSRI has caused you this problem before doesn't necessarily mean it will be as bad on Auvelity.

# Feeling buzzed on Auvelity

This is one of the most common side effects reported here, is the one that I've most experienced myself, and has resulted in my doing a ton of research. This is something that anyone with too much DXM in their system is going to experience: you will get dissociated / buzzed / high. Some people apparently enjoy this and abuse DXM recreationally by taking large amounts of it.

The usual advice here is to ""wait it out"", and that does work for many people; your body has a lot of feedback loops built into it, and if there's too much of something it will often adapt over time to tolerate it. This is the mechanism behind ""tolerance"" for a wide variety of drugs. Drinking a cup of coffee or having 3 drinks of alcohol is a very different experience if you don't ever use either vs if that's a normal thing for you.

The most easily addressed reason for this: taking too much Auvelity at once. Unlike many psychiatric meds, Auvelity goes in and out of your system relatively quickly, and timing is really important. If you are prescribed two a day and you take them both at the same time, you will have 2x the amount of DXM in your system than is intended for a few hours, and you will definitely get impaired. Don't do this! I did it by accident (I'm in the habit of swallowing a whole handful of pills and supplements at once) and was incapacitated for much of the day.

Another potential reason: you may just be someone who is pretty sensitive to what's going on in your head, and even mild dissociation is uncomfortable. This is a case where ""sticking it out"" may help; giving yourself time to develop a tolerance that will reduce or eliminate the buzzed feeling. This is conjecture on my part, but I do know from a lot of personal experience that people have VERY widely varying tolerances for sensations of various kinds.

However, if you find the experience of being on Auvelity extremely difficult at first, or if the discomfort persists, there may be something genetic going on, or an interaction with another drug. Again, talk with your doctor. This is one of many reasons why psychiatry involves a lot more trial and error than is ideal. Here's where things start to get more science-y, but I'll try to keep it simple. If you want the full details, check out the blog article in the Auvelity basics section.

# Auvelity Buzz and Genetics: CYP2D6 enzyme

Normally, as mentioned in the Auvelity basics section above, DXM is metabolized by your body into other substances in a way that is blocked by bupropion. The primary mechanism is an enzyme called CYP2D6, which bupropion interferes with.

Some people have genetic mutations that result in a lack of (or a malformed) CYP2D6 enzyme, which means that their metabolism of DXM is already poor. For these people, taking Auvelity may result in DXM sticking around for even longer, at higher concentrations. The published fact sheet suggests that people with this mutation only take one Auvelity per day. The Cafer blog suggests that they may not actually need to take the bupropion at all, and will get many of the benefits of Auvelity simply by taking DXM by itself. However, they would be missing out on some of the benefits that come along with bupropion. If you find that Auvelity feels very ""strong"", consider staying on only 1 pill a day rather than adding the second.

How do you know if you are in this situation? The only answer is genetic testing. This is something that some psychiatrists offer, but is unlikely to be covered by insurance and isn't cheap. How prevalent this phenotype varies WIDELY among different populations globally; it's as high as 61% of people of Algerian descent, and as low as 2.7% in Gambia, according to a study I found.

Note that the low metabolism CYP2D6 phenotype doesn't just impact DXM; it's involved in metabolism in a variety of other medications as well, and if you are someone who generally has a hard time finding the right psychiatric medication or right doses of psychiatric medications, you may want to look into getting genetic testing.

Digression: Genetic testing often isn't covered by insurance and is a bit controversial among psychiatrists because it hasn't proven to be cost-effectively beneficial in studies that aren't sponsored by the companies which do it. In my personal experience with multiple family members who have had it, the guidance was more useful in retrospect (""oh, this is why that didn't work well"") than in predicting which medications would work best without a lot of prior experimentation. I personally would not recommend paying for genetic testing until you've tried a bunch of first-line meds and had trouble finding something that works.

# Auvelity Buzz and Genetics: CYP3A4 and CYP2C9

This is where we get into the realm of more conjecture. My personal experience with Auvelity is that it just feels ""a little too strong"". After more than a month on a single dose, I was still getting a little buzzed every morning. It wasn't severe- I could still function normally, and the benefits the rest of the day were clear and positive. But I didn't like it, and after some time I found that I was dragging a bit in the evenings and felt I could benefit from a second dose. However, I \*hated\* feeling like this twice a day and couldn't keep it up for more 3 days in a row. My sense has been that it would be perfect if I could take a little less DXM, but Auvelity is only available at a single quantity of 45mg DXM.

Potential explanation: When the CYP2D6 enzyme is being blocked, there are two other pathways for DXM metabolism: the CYP3A4 and CPY2C9 enzymes. I haven't personally had genetic testing done, but two of my kids have, and based on that it's possible that I have low metabolism variants of both of these.

My hypothesis is that this is why Auvelity continues to feel too strong for me; when I've got bupropion blocking CPY2D6, there's potentially almost no metabolism happening. As a result, as the time release puts more and more of it into my system, I end up getting buzzed. My psychiatrist concurs that this is a reasonable explanation for what I'm experiencing.

As a result, we have been experiencing with DIY: taking bupropion and using over the counter DXM together. I used to be on 150mg bupropion XL, so I've resumed that, and use a slow release DXM 30mg twice a day rather than 45mg. XL is the version of Bupropion with an especially long-delayed release, and is only taken once per day. I'm getting less bupropion than is in Auvelity, but I also had previously been on 300mg Bupropion XL and found that ""too strong"" as well.

This combination (150mg Bup XL + 2x 30mg DXM extended release) been working really well. It's also more forgiving from a timing perspective because I'm not taking the stimulating bupropion twice a day... if I take the DXM late it just burns off when the bupropion wears off.

Side note: I've been using the extended release DXM syrup (brand name Delsym, but there are a lot of generics) which contains a form of DXM called Dextromethorphan Polystirix that releases more slowly than DXM hydrobromide (the usual form). I had tried standard DXM first and it definitely came on too fast and went away too soon. I asked my doctor about long term use of the long-release version, and after some research she cautioned that it contains parabens, which are controversial and potentially problematic from a health perspective. She recommended some long-release over the counter pills which I will try when I run out of the syrup.

For those of you who have gotten this far and are wondering about this for yourself: I know I sound like a broken record, but **talk with your psychiatrist before going DIY.** I was worried about that conversation but at least mine was really open to it, and already familiar due to how many people can't afford Auvelity if they are on public insurance.

Also, keep in mind that the genetic mutations I likely personally have are not super common. If there weren't another option I would have stayed on 1 dose of Auvelity a day; my side effects weren't severe. And, my depression is not very severe to begin with... it's just very, very longstanding and related to my being on the autism spectrum and the struggles that come with that. Having said that, Auvelity has had a really positive impact on my life. I actually got tears in my eyes from laughing for the first time in a couple of decades a few weeks ago.

Anyway, if you've made it this far, I hope this is helpful. Remember that Internet forums like this one tend to attract the relatively small percentage of people that are having an issue; people for whom a drug is working well don't tend to spend time looking for information about it, so don't assume that because you see a bunch of complaints here that this drug has widespread problems.
