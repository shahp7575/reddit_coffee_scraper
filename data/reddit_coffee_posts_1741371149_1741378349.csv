1j5ypj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1j5ypj7/anyone_here_on_ppis_they_cause_slow_motility_and/,Anyone here on PPI’s ? They cause slow motility and constipation.,"Hi All,

I have been trying to rack my brain of how I get hard bowel movements more frequently than not. Nearly all foods (whole foods) would get me bloated and constipated. Yes including veg/fruits. I drink half my body weight in water. 

So years ago I was put on PPI(ant acids) and that’s where all my issues started. Bleeding/hard stools. When I stopped taking those PPI’s my symptoms persisted for years. Even with taking miralax ! It would be a hit or miss lol

So I did some digging, if your on PPI’s for long time it can cause hard stools because of lack of stomach acid. Low Vitamin B12 which we need to absorb nutrients and magnesium. 

So I went out and bought, magnesium, vitamin B12 and a digestive enzymes. I would took the B12 in the morning and then a digestive enzyme before a meal and in the evening 500 mg of magnesium. For the first time in a while, I woke up and had to use the bathroom ! And it was soft ! I don’t know if it’s a coincidence… but the day before, I drank coffee with creame and sugar. Followed by bread/veg/chicken/eggs I never eat bread because I thought I was intolerant and never creamer because I am lactose intolerant. Then I have huge serving of BBq. Included chicken/beef/lamb rice etc. I haven’t eaten red meat in a long time because it wouldn’t agree with me. 

All that would have messed me up in the morning. But nothing. ",1,1741377750.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

# A Roast of r/Accounting: Bean Counters Gone Wild (…In a Mildly Amusing Way)

The r/Accounting subreddit is where number-crunchers gather to commiserate, brag, and meme about the thrilling (read: often soul-crushing) life of an accountant. It’s essentially a support group and comedy club for CPAs, auditors, and tax pros. Below, we playfully roast this community by spotlighting its recurring themes, grievances, inside jokes, and the self-deprecating humor that holds it all together.

# Busy Season PTSD and Overtime Olympics

If you wander into r/Accounting in the first quarter of the year, you’ll quickly learn two things: (1) “busy season” is their personal winter in Game of Thrones, and (2) coping with it has basically become a competitive sport. Newcomers post wide-eyed realizations like “You guys weren’t joking about busy season” only to be met with veteran commenters swapping war stories and trauma bonding over how many 70+ hour weeks they survived. One user quipped “It’s giving me PTSD!” about even reading a busy season discussion​

[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rxudnu/you_guys_werent_joking_about_busy_season/#:~:text=Lanskiiii). Another reminisced, “Brings me back to when I was young, numb, and dumb.”​[old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rxudnu/you_guys_werent_joking_about_busy_season/#:~:text=load%20more%20comments%C2%A0) – a poetic way of saying public accounting aged them about 20 years in 2 busy seasons.

The subreddit often reads like a marathon runner forum – except the marathon is a 3-month slog of auditing financials or doing taxes until 2 AM. Members proudly (and sarcastically) tally how many consecutive busy seasons they’ve endured as if they’re badges of honor or battle scars. “Seven in a row, never again,” one weary accountant confessed​

[old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rxudnu/you_guys_werent_joking_about_busy_season/#:~:text=,3%20children). Survival tips get shared liberally: “Make sure you set aside at least an hour a day to do something you enjoy,” advised one post-busy-season survivor, stressing the importance of clinging to a shred of humanity during the crunch​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rxudnu/you_guys_werent_joking_about_busy_season/#:~:text=RedRedditor12). Others simply embrace the absurdity: “If you’re booked for 55 \[hours\], you’re actually going to be working 65-70. Good luck… and also don’t you dare bill even close to the 55.”​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rxudnu/you_guys_werent_joking_about_busy_season/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%E2%80%A2%20Edited) In other words, welcome to public accounting, where working unpaid overtime is an art form and a rite of passage.

“Me before busy season vs me after.” The popular meme above humorously captures how an accountant feels at the start vs. the end of busy season. It’s Baby Yoda’s innocence transformed into Yoda’s haggard wisdom – a perfect illustration of what r/Accounting lovingly calls “busy season glow-down.”

And of course, no busy season rant is complete without mentioning the reward for all that suffering. The community loves to roast how management tries to boost morale with token gestures. Case in point: the legendary pizza parties. One user dryly noted that as the boss’s “favorite” they got a single slice of pizza as thanks for working like a mule – “He didn't even bother to bring me a drink.”​

[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1izpro7/i_hate_my_job/#:~:text=,Downvote%20Reply%20reply). In r/Accounting’s collective mind, nothing screams “we value you” like lukewarm pizza at 11 PM during your fourth 12-hour day of the week. 🥴

# The Great Big 4 Exodus (and Other Career Crises)

Another recurring saga on r/Accounting is the Big 4 experience – or more specifically, escaping it. The Big 4 accounting firms (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) are simultaneously revered as top career destinations and reviled as sweatshops. It’s a love-hate relationship, heavy on the hate. The subreddit is flooded with posts from overworked auditors and consultants at Big 4 asking “Should I quit?” – usually answered by a resounding chorus of “YES (best decision ever)!”. It’s practically a meme how often members proclaim that leaving Big 4 saved their sanity, improved their health, made them rediscover weekends, etc. There’s zero subtlety here: r/Accounting will quickly let you know that “public accounting is a cult, get out while you can.”

Grievances in these threads range from insane hours and meh pay, to managers breathing down your neck about utilization rates. Users swap horror stories of working until 3 AM in hotel lobbies, or being voluntold to cancel vacations for a client emergency. By the time someone posts their “I quit Big 4 today!” triumph, they’re greeted like a soldier returning from war. Expect dozens of replies like “Congratulations, you’ve reclaimed your soul” or “Left after 2 years – never been happier.” The subreddit might as well have a sticky post titled “Leaving Big 4: You’ll Be Fine, Trust Us.” Even those still stuck there join in the dark humor, referring to themselves as “Big 4 survivors” in training.

Outside of Big 4, r/Accounting also entertains plenty of career angst in general. People debate fleeing to private industry accounting (where 40-hour weeks sound heavenly), switching to finance/tech, or even leaving accounting entirely for a saner life. But even these serious discussions are laced with wit. It’s not uncommon for someone to joke that the “exit opportunity” they dream of is winning the lottery. The overall vibe is: we chose this profession, we kind of regret it at times, but at least we can joke about it together. And boy, do they ever.

# Memes Only an Accountant Would Love

Despite the stereotype that accountants are boring number drones, r/Accounting proves they have a wicked sense of humor – albeit a very niche one. This subreddit has developed its own lore of inside jokes and memes. To the uninitiated, some threads look like nonsense, but for the accounting crowd it’s pure comedic gold. Let’s break down a few of the sub’s greatest hits that get referenced again and again:

* The Legend of “Deloittussy” – Perhaps the sub’s most infamous inside joke. It started with a wild NSFW story/post (the details of which are… hazy and ridiculous) involving Deloitte and, well, -ussy (use your imagination). No one fully knows what “Deloittussy” means, but that’s the point – “No one knows what it means, but it’s provocative… gets the partners going.”​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/uxrmxg/i_dont_know_what_a_deloittussy_is_and_at_this/#:~:text=ardvark_11). The term took on a life of its own. Users still ask “Whatever happened to the Deloittussy guy?” like he’s a missing folk hero. It’s been said that this meme is “so famous in this subreddit yet so unknown in the grand scheme of reddit.”​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/uxrmxg/i_dont_know_what_a_deloittussy_is_and_at_this/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2) In short, Deloittussy is r/Accounting’s secret handshake – utterly absurd and uniquely ours.
* The 2008 Excel Guidebook Heist – An epic multi-part saga about a stolen Microsoft Excel 2008 manual that unfolded via a series of tongue-in-cheek posts. It began with an indignant “open letter” to a temp who misplaced the guidebook, followed by community members role-playing the thief, the witnesses, etc., in subsequent posts​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/r7qkxr/just_stole_a_2008_excel_guidebook_at_a_place_i/#:~:text=The%202008%20Excel%20Guidebook%20Saga). This culminated in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) by the self-proclaimed guidebook thief. The sub essentially turned a dull office anecdote into a full-blown melodrama, complete with twists and a ransom demand for the return of the precious Excel tome. The commitment to the bit was chef’s kiss – and now any mention of 2008 Excel guidebook sends the community into giggles.
* “Is This a Good PC for an Accountant?” – The meme that mocks how overly serious some newbies can be. Apparently every few weeks someone asks if they need a high-end computer setup for accounting work, as if Excel and QuickBooks require a NASA supercomputer. The community’s running joke: recommending comically overpowered specs (“You’ll want a 3090 GPU to really make those pivot tables sing 🎶”). It became such a frequent question that it turned into a meme poll option​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ub2brt/best_meme_of_the_busy_season/#:~:text=Deloittoussy). In reality, any cheap laptop can run Excel, so this is r/Accounting’s way of saying “chill, you don’t need a gaming rig to subtotal rows in Excel.”
* Pizza Party Parodies – As mentioned earlier, nothing unites accountants like roasting the token “rewards” firms give during crunch time. The concept of toiling for weeks only to receive a pizza party (or a solitary slice) is a meme unto itself. The sub jokes that accountants calculate the NPV of free pizza and conclude it’s basically worthless. One popular parody might be a mock “Busy Season Bingo” card with a square for “Boss buys team pizza (again)”. It’s humor as therapy – if you don’t laugh, you’ll cry (and then eat cold pizza).
* “I Sh My Pants in Front of Senior Manager”\*\* – Yes, this was actually a meme/poll option on the sub​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ub2brt/best_meme_of_the_busy_season/#:~:text=Deloittoussy). It references an outrageous story shared by a user (we’ll spare the gory details) which instantly became r/Accounting legend. Let’s just say it perfectly captures that awkward work nightmare scenario, dialed up to 11. The community’s sense of humor definitely skews a bit crude at times – but hey, stress and a diet of black coffee can lead to accidents. This tale lives on in subreddit lore (and likely in one very embarrassed ex-intern’s memory).
* Accounting “Passion” Posts – Every now and then, a joker will post a too-enthusiastic satire about loving accounting, and it’s obvious satire because no real accountant is that excited. A classic example described a day in the life of an accountant with over-the-top glee: getting “a thrill in my chest pumping… ecstasy every time things balance… clenching my stomach muscles in delight” when the debits equal the credits​[old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/own03j/i_live_for_accounting_3_i_die_for_accounting_3/#:~:text=As%20I%20began%20entering%20in,3). It was basically 50 Shades of Grey, Accounting Edition – the OP professed they “live for accounting <3” while gulping free office coffee and happily agreeing to unpaid overtime​[old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/own03j/i_live_for_accounting_3_i_die_for_accounting_3/#:~:text=Oh,for%20free%21%20I%20obviously%20agree). The sub LOVED it – because it’s hilarious through the lens of sarcasm. In reality, most folks on r/Accounting are more likely to say “I love accounting” with an eye-roll or a tear in their eye. These spoof posts let everyone poke fun at the idea that we actually enjoy this grind. (Spoiler: we enjoy complaining about it far more.)

Those are just a few examples – the tip of the iceberg lettuce (inside joke: an audit meme about only checking what’s on top… okay, we’ll see ourselves out). The key is that r/Accounting has cultivated a very specific brand of humor. It’s full of puns on financial terms, meme references to Excel or tax codes, and callbacks to niche incidents only accounting nerds would know. One user even marveled, “Where are these accountants? Secret jokers!” upon discovering the sub’s witty side. Indeed, the subreddit proves that even “bean counters” can drop a spicy one-liner or create an absurd meme saga when inspiration (or desperation during busy season) strikes.

# Self-Deprecation: The Official Second Language

Perhaps the most endearing (and roast-worthy) aspect of r/Accounting is its self-deprecating tone. Accountants on this sub rarely take themselves too seriously. They’ll be the first to call themselves “glorified data entry clerks” or joke that their social life is DOA during CPA exam prep. The community thrives on airing out their struggles and then laughing them off together. It’s like a big inside joke that “we’re all in this thankless job, haha,” which actually fosters a sense of camaraderie.

For example, when someone complains “I hate my job” or “accounting sucks,” responses often mix genuine advice with humorous commiseration. “My manager’s idea of appreciation was letting me keep the stale donuts in the break room. Living the dream!” – a hypothetical reply that wouldn’t be out of place. They’ll joke about Excel being their real BFF or about how they have the “joy” of explaining to drunk uncles at Thanksgiving that no, they will not do their taxes for free. An ever-popular meme in wider accounting circles is an image of a tired accountant with the caption: “Friends think I do taxes all year. I actually reconcile spreadsheets and cry.” – r/Accounting would wholeheartedly agree.

Moreover, the way accountants interact on the subreddit reveals a playful mix of sarcasm and support. Seasoned members adopt tongue-in-cheek flairs like “CPA (Can’t Provide Answers)” or usernames like u/AICPAncake (a pun on the AICPA exam + pancake) to signal they don’t take this too earnestly. They dish out tough love to students and newbies: e.g., telling an overly eager intern to “run while you still can 😂,” but then genuinely helping with interview tips or certification advice in the next breath. It’s a unique dynamic where jaded professionals and fresh grads bond over shared pain points. They’ll roast each other (“enjoy those 70-hour weeks, kid​

[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rxudnu/you_guys_werent_joking_about_busy_season/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%E2%80%A2%20Edited)”) but also reassure each other (“it gets better after busy season... sort of”).

In r/Accounting’s world, misery loves company – and that company loves humor. The community collectively rolls its eyes at the profession’s quirks: the archaic clients, the indecipherable email from a partner at 1 AM, the joy of ticking and tying audit workpapers for hours. But by turning these into running gags, they make it almost fun. It’s like they’ve turned a monotonous job into a sitcom where every accountant is both a character and a member of the laugh track.

# Conclusion: Debit Credit Ha-Ha’s

In the end, r/Accounting is a paradoxical place: a subreddit full of people who often regret their career choices, yet can’t stop joking about them. It’s equal parts therapy session, Q&A forum, and meme factory. The recurring themes – brutal busy seasons, Big 4 burnout, underappreciated grunt work – set the stage for the community’s inside jokes and roasts of their own industry. They’ve built a culture where complaining is cathartic and comedic, where an Excel spreadsheet can be the setup to a punchline, and where only on this subreddit would a term like “Deloittussy” become folklore.

So here’s to r/Accounting: the online water cooler where accountants swap stories of debits, credits, and debauchery (of the Excel variety). It’s not glamorous, it’s certainly not always sane, but it is consistently funny if you speak the language of accounting sarcasm. As the sub’s favorite mantra goes (usually uttered after a rant about overtime): “I love accounting. I die for accounting. I live for accounting <3”​

[old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/own03j/i_live_for_accounting_3_i_die_for_accounting_3/#:~:text=as%20I%20used%20at%20work,Afterall%2C%20accounting%20is%20my%20passion)– said with maximum eye-roll, of course. In other words, they know their profession is a joke… so they might as well get a good laugh out of it. And on r/Accounting, they do exactly that, one meme and gripe at a time.",0,1741377348.0,Accounting,3,0.22,False

Honestly the first 6 months of living together was great for the most part. 

We have to give notice if we're staying or moving out in a few weeks. I'm deciding if I would want to renew the lease for another year because the problems are not THAT bad or if I need to move out and find another roommate. The problems:

1. they are tidy, but dirty

example 1: washes dishes quickly and doesn't let them linger in the sink for more than a few hours at most, but every time their dishes dry there is still food/oil on the dishes that they ""washed"". I always have to rewash a dish before using it if they were the last one to wash it.

example 2: they spilled a coffee on the kitchen tile floor, and immediately cleaned it up. when the cleaner dried, there still was a visible spill on the floor (not even sure how this is possible). did not reclean with the visible spill still there.

example 3: when I leave the apartment for a trip, the apartment will not get cleaned. I didn't really notice until I started leaving more often, but it has become clear that I am the only one actually cleaning common areas and not just tidying up. 

  
2. has made apartment decisions without discussion

example 1: they decided they wanted to buy a vitamix blender for smoothies. I already have a blender, not a super nice one like vitamix, but it still works well. when their new blender arrived, they threw away my blender. my blender wasn't broken and they didn't even ask me what i wanted to do with it. we have ample kitchen storage and could have easily kept two blenders with no problems. when asked, they did apologize but said they didn't think to ask because why would we need two blenders.

example 2: decided we would start sharing paper goods, when we've always bought our own prior. no conversation with me about wanting to now share, but has made some comments to let me know that we're running low on toilet paper (we have separate bathrooms but kept our individual paper goods in a hall closet). 

example 3: we had agreed before moving in that we would keep all of our food separate. it was established that we would allow each other to share/try food, but we just needed to ask first. In the fall, I had hosted a friendsgiving at our apartment and my roommate joined. Friendsgiving was BYOB, and my roommate knew it was BYOB but they proceeded to drink the drinks that I bought for myself without asking (despite having drinks of their own in the fridge). afterwards, they even took some of the unused food I had bought for the party and put it on their pantry shelf. when I asked later, they said they thought it was their food that they had purchased and just a mix up. 

  
is my roommate bad? overall things are fine and manageable but I'm not sure if I'm gaslighting myself to believe that because I just love the apartment we're in. for some of the things mentioned I feel as though it's moreso them not thinking things through rather than actually being intentionally rude.

I am not comfortable with sharing my age, but I am an underage highschool student. He is 50 and my teacher. It all started, when he started teaching me a year ago. Little things. He would talk to me often after class. Tell me how smart and special I am. He was always a bit touchy, but nothing excessively unusual. One time he told me I looked cute. He even asked me to meet for a coffee sometime. I used to like him and admire him a little. Obviously, he is over 30 years ahead of me. 

He has a girlfriend and since she was pregnant, he stayed at home for a longer time. And when he came back everything was different. I was emotionally very unstable at that point and he would offer me to talk to him. When we did, he would hug me and wouldn't let go. I didn’t say anything. I was desperate for any affection at that point. But I remember that I stared at the wall and was disgusted by myself. He would whisper in my ear what a lovely girl I am and stuff. He said that he gets me so much and he sees himself in me. (this man is nothing like me!) 

I met him again after this. He would always tell me how mature I am, how nobody will ever get „what we have“ and that I should never tell anybody. He would touch me. And I know it was wrong and disgusting, but I was overwhelmed. He would always reassure me that its normal. He once indirectly asked me to straddle his lap. Obviously I knew why he said that and didn’t do it. He thought im stupid. 

One day when we were talking he would just randomly kiss me and pull me on his lap. He rubbed me against him. He came in his pants. I registered what happened after it was over. After that something changed in me. I feel empty. Its like he took somebody from me, ripped my wings out. After that he couldn't stop being sexual. I cried about some trouble at home and he would make sexual jokes again. Once he told me that he would love to knock me up. (I hope it was a joke, but given the context and how he touched me while saying that, im honestly not sure.)

I hate this man and honestly he disgusts me. If I look at him during the lesson I feel like throwing up. Seriously I also feel so guilty because of his girlfriend and child. (If I was her and found that out that my boyfriend is messing with a minor I would probably would kill him.)  I struggle going to school lately and didn’t get why. And now I get it. I am avoiding him and the place I associate him with. God, I don’t know how to keep going…

Let’s call the problematic one Jerry. He could have some sort of special needs but none I’ve been told of, he just can’t carry a conversation unless he’s watching YouTube, then he’ll pause and respond to the YouTuber and laugh loudly. Jerry uses most of the freezer and counter space for his various cooking things. Often sleeps in living room bc he wakes up more efficiently and sometimes sleeps on floor in his room. Doesn’t use soap, just baking soda that is all over the kitchen and disgusting. No matter how much I tell him, he never cleans. He never ate normally, but in the last year he’s begun to eat organ meats extremely often. That may not be a problem by itself, but he has a giant pot on the stove that never ever comes off. The heat goes off though and it just stays for days until he adds more meat, some chicken, turkey, pork brains, chicken livers, veggies, eggs, and more meat for sure. It also had coffee grounds and tea blended together with a munch of other stuff poured in. I know bc I watch him when I’m out there making something, I once asked “What all goes in that thing?” And he just laughed and said nothing. It has begun to smell so horrid that I spray shit out there constantly. He knows we all hate it. He has anger issues but never directed at people, just holes in the walls and banging around yelling. Well since the smell has become so bad it makes us gag, I sprayed that shit on the lid of his pot, never opened it. So I’m in my room when he walks in the kitchen and smells the cotton scented spray. He starts yelling “Who sprayed this shit??” He’s banging around and then I hear some metal clanking and he comes in my bathroom common area shared with my roommate. He blows out my candle so I jump out of bed and he runs out. I yell at him to “Leave this shit alone”. I’ve never yelled at him before but when I went to find him he’d ran to his room, mumbling to himself, and I notice my door has slashes from a knife on it. He crossed a line and I just don’t know what to do. Jerry is now convinced I’m trying to poison him or some shit, his pot is off the stove for now, idk where, and it smells good for once. I never yell at anyone and I am not looking for someone to tell me I’m in the right, I just want to know what you would do in my situation. He does a bunch more weird shit but that’s the problematic stuff, his Facebook indicates that he grew up fairly normally, playing same games as me, posting when he was in middle school. I will say that in the Summer he’ll sit next to a girl at the pool and just talk to her until she gets up and leaves. Shorts pulled up his ass and no shirt, very strange and he’s never talked to one twice or brought any friends at all inside. Lastly he enjoys nature and barefoot walks.

We exchange letters back and forth as well as see each other once a month, though when we see each other it's normally in a group setting. Anyways we called a few times and texted in between these visits. However there is strong interest with each other: We share the same religious backround/beliefs + career goals and our personalities generally line up well. This interest has grown as time went on for months and everytime I was going to ask her out something would pop up in one of our lives (I had a health scare in my immediate family + other family things going on, she had a very close negative family event occur) the most recent one of these events occurred for her some what recently in the past two weeks.  Also one of the rules in the program is no dating between members even if there's a distance and we are both semi rule driven

My question is that I want to ask her out in April, since a lot has gone on between us I want to ask her out even with all the things going on I feel a strong urge and want to. Also I want to give her some time to process and readjust to the program. The plan is for me to call her after 2-3 weeks bring up that I'll be in the city she is for a stretch of time ask if she wants to grab coffee at a place next to where she's saying and then when we go meet up ask her out more formally at the end.

I'm just scared that she's lost interest since a lot of time has passed, like we maintained regular contact and barring stressful personal events it's been very communicative.",1,1741375811.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

INT. PRINCETON-PLAINSBORO, ONCOLOGY WARD - NIGHT

Wilson lies weakly in bed, pale, gaunt from chemotherapy. HOUSE sits beside him, unreadable, brooding, cane propped against the chair.

WILSON:
I’m tired, House.

HOUSE:
Yeah, cancer’s inconsiderate like that.

Wilson manages a weak smile.

WILSON:
Did you find anything?

House hesitates, rare vulnerability flashing.

HOUSE:
Experimental trial. Risky… as in “could kill you faster” risky.

Wilson nods slowly.

WILSON:
Odds?

HOUSE:
Same as your usual dating success rate. About one in a thousand.

Wilson sighs, accepting fate.

WILSON:
Then I guess I’m ready.

House looks away, conflicted.

⸻

INT. HOUSE’S OFFICE – LATE NIGHT

House is alone, frantically researching, surrounded by medical texts, coffee cups, and pills. Chase walks in hesitantly.

CHASE:
House, what are you doing?

HOUSE:
Saving Wilson from the universe’s shitty sense of humor.

Chase sighs, concerned.

CHASE:
You can’t fix everything, House.

HOUSE:
Watch me.

⸻

INT. EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT ROOM – NIGHT

Wilson lies on hospital bed, hooked up to IVs, weak, pale. House stands silently next to him.

HOUSE:
You really want to do this?

Wilson smiles softly.

WILSON:
Either way, it’s borrowed time.

HOUSE (quietly):
Maybe… maybe not.

House leans in, whispers something indistinct. Wilson looks concerned.

WILSON:
Greg, what did you do?

House stands, deflecting with familiar sarcasm.

HOUSE:
Committed insurance fraud, probably.

Wilson stares suspiciously, but says nothing.

⸻

INT. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE ROOM – NEXT DAY

Wilson lies hooked up to machines. Team monitors closely. House stands silently in the observation room.

Cameron approaches Chase, worried.

CAMERON:
The treatment’s experimental—House knew the risks.

CHASE:
House always knows the risks. He’s counting on them.

Foreman suddenly realizes, panic in his eyes.

FOREMAN:
Where’s House?

⸻

INT. HOUSE’S OFFICE – SIMULTANEOUS

Foreman bursts in, finds House collapsed on floor, empty syringe beside him.

FOREMAN:
Oh my god—House!

House, barely conscious, meets Foreman’s eyes.

HOUSE:
Wilson’s marrow wasn’t compatible…mine is.

Foreman realizes instantly.

FOREMAN:
You swapped your medical records?

House struggles to speak.

HOUSE:
Don’t spoil the surprise.

Finally found a patient worth dying for.

Foreman frantically dials phone.

⸻

INT. ICU – NIGHT

House lies in hospital bed, Wilson now healthy, sits next to him, devastated.

WILSON:

House grins faintly, pain in his eyes.

HOUSE:
Cynical plot twist. Audiences love character development.

Wilson, voice breaking.

WILSON:
You didn’t have to do this.

House struggles, speaks softly, genuinely.

HOUSE:
You’ve spent decades saving me. Only fair.

Wilson tearfully smiles.

WILSON:
You always have to win, don’t you?

House nods weakly, exhausted smile.

HOUSE:
Terminal narcissism. No cure.

Wilson laughs softly through tears.

WILSON:
How long?

HOUSE:
Long enough.

House looks at Wilson meaningfully.

HOUSE:
It was worth it. You’re the one good diagnosis I ever got right.

Wilson takes House’s hand, gripping tightly.

⸻

EXT. PRINCETON-PLAINSBORO – SUNRISE

Wilson stands alone on rooftop, ashes urn in hand. Chase, Cameron, Foreman nearby.

Wilson gently scatters ashes into the wind.

CHASE, softly:
He’d hate the sentimentality.

WILSON, smiling sadly:
Exactly why I’m doing it.

The group chuckles quietly.

FOREMAN:
Think he believed in heaven?

WILSON:
No, but if he’s wrong…

God’s in for a very rough eternity.

⸻

INT. HOSPITAL – HOUSE’S OFFICE – DAY

Wilson enters empty office, sits at House’s desk. Opens drawer, finds Vicodin bottle. Holds it thoughtfully.

He notices a note in House’s handwriting:

“Wilson—
If you’re reading this, congratulations: you’re officially less dead than me. Try not to ruin it by grieving like a moron.
—House.”

Wilson laughs bitterly, gently folds note.

It’s important to cultivate a positive and optimistic mindset when navigating day to day life. Now that doesn’t mean being toxically positive, trying to see the positive even in the most negative moments. On the contrary- maintaining an optimistic mindset can include acknowledging and validating hardships, whilst also focusing and acknowledging all the positive and wonderful things that are happening in your life.

Here are a few ways to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset:

1. **Gratitude**: You can [**practice gratitude**](https://talkingforwellness.com//blog/want-to-increase-positivity-practice-gratitude/) by simply growing more aware of all the things that are happening in your life that you are thankful for. You can do this either by investing in a gratitude journal, or simply by including gratitude in your routine.
2. **Invite awareness to every moment:** When we are present and aware whilst navigating life, we are more likely to notice the more subtle and small nuances that could bring us joy.
3. **Challenge negative thoughts and beliefs:** When you notice yourself engage in negative self-talk or beliefs surrounding yourself and the world, try to be more aware and try to challenge those beliefs or label them so that they don’t interfere with your psyche.
4. **Increase Joy:** Ask yourself what truly brings you happiness, calm, and purpose, and do more of it! When we intentionally create lives filled with activities, people, and places that bring us joy, we are more likely to have a more positive outlook on life
5. **Be kind to others**: research shows that when we treat others with kindness and give from our time and energy, we tend to feel more positively about ourselves and our lives. This could be anything from buying a friend or a colleague a cup of coffee, to volunteering with a population you care about, to just smiling at a passerby.

If you’re noticing that it may be harder to cultivate a more positive and optimistic outlook on life, and you’ve tried all the above tips and feel exhausted and helpless, then it may be time to discuss this with a professional. At times, we can do everything to elevate our lives and mental health, but there may be a reason that’s beyond our control that’s leaving us feeling stuck. You are not alone- you can lean on other’s to create more optimism in your life.

2. Food wrapping: where you can grab a bunch of items and use a machine to put everything in a bag/ box. So something like the trays we have but instead of holding a tray with a bunch of food, we’re holding a take out bag/ box with food


3. Customizable logos: (using decals) on mugs, take out boxes, trays etc


4. Customizable Billboards around town: where you pay to put your advertisement up (after paying some cash)


5. Customizable party invite feature: the current party invite feature but using decals (Roblox censors out inappropriate decals so it’s not going to be that bad). This would make the party invites more personal and better.


6. Customizable menu items: this could be tricky. But some items like cake, coffee etc can be such a way where the plot owner can make their own drinks/ cakes/ cupcakes based on the colors and flavours and can be used on the menu and make it a permanent recipe for their own plot. (Idk how to explain help, is anyone seeing my vision?!)


7. Outfit mannequin: where you can load outfits for staff (using clothes codes) and people can wear it just by clicking. This will be useful in schools, and can also be used in clothes stores. Since this could be complicated, they can make it only for classic clothes.


8. Doors with keypad locks: this can be helpful for hotels so that only the guests can access the room.


9. Global event feature: so this is like the party feature, but it’s available for all servers. Like the public neighborhood feature but there’s a separate tab for all the current ongoing events.


10. Business kiosk: stay with me cuz this might be confusing. So basically imagine you own a cafe in bloxburg and you want to make a kiosk for that cafe. You get a designated space to build a kiosk and customize it according to your preferences. Now you can advertise your kiosks to other people who can buy it at their plots. For eg: people with stadiums, malls, zoos, schools etcs can buy your kiosk and you get a share of the buying cost + your brand can be promoted.


11. Phones! A lot of business features can be added to the phone- like customizable apps (Im getting too ambitious yall, bloxburg cant even fix the glitching grass and im talking about apps😭), business reviews, hiring ads etc. 


This is all I can think of, but if you guys have any businesses and have any features that you would like to see added, drop your ideas",1,1741375074.0,Bloxburg,2,0.67,False
1j5xdzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterporn/comments/1j5xdzh/really_wish_i_could_ask_some_questions/,Really wish I could ask some questions...,"Trying to talk to my partner about his sex/porn addiction always triggers defensiveness that is on a whole other level. We are in couples counseling and he's been told over and over that he has to be willing to open up, stay honest, be vulnerable, and answer questions about the many affairs he had. But anything that cuts too close to the heart of the matter and he goes into strong and silent mode, gets defensive, begins DARVO, the whole nine yards. 

I wish I could ask someone about their sex addiction. Someone who isn't upset with me for whatever reason, maybe just a stranger who can give me insights. 

I want to ask things like... 

What is so appealing about acting out that you will do so knowing that you are destroying your life and the lives of those around you? 

Why is staying in recovery so very difficult? Is it a matter of no willpower? 

Why do you get resentful of ME when you can't do what ""normal people"" do, like going out to get coffee with a coworker, when you are the one who has proven that you can't maintain boundaries? 

Why did you expect me to be monogamous when you were anything but? 

Why do you look down on things like polyamory when you are obviously not monogamous yourself? 

At what point do you see the deep damage of your actions? What does it take to make you take recovery seriously? 

Why do you see my questions about your affairs as an attack? (No matter how calm and rational I am, you get so defensive that you turn it around and make me the ""bad guy."")

Why do you stay with me when you so clearly want other people? 

What makes it so hard to give the bare minimum of being open and honest? 

What are you so afraid of? 

And so many more questions... I would give anything to sit down on a phone call with a sex addict and ask all of these questions and get a different perspective. I really want to understand what it's like. I really do. But how can I understand when I can't get answers?

I don't know what you're up to at this time of the year. I wonder what your hair looks like now? Do you have any new tattoos? Are you now working for a new company, or did you develop the goals that you set last year for yourself (read more, etc)? Are you now dating someone else?

Today, I hope you'd have a good birthday. I remember when you said to me last year, ""This year, this birthday is the first birthday when I chose myself."" I hope you'd still do it today. 

We might be living two different lives now, and we might not be talking anymore, but I'll always remember our beautiful memories and cherish them. I don't care if you weren't committed to me as I am to you, or whether you did things half-heartedly. It doesn't matter now. What I'll always hope for: Is you'd completely heal and be whole again. If you found another person by now, I hope this person will make you happy and love you totally.

Lastly, I hope you'd remember me not on a bad note: But as someone who genuinely cared and loved you even in a short span of time. I hope I'd still live in your memories, as someone who used to cook meals for you. Make you coffee. Hug and kiss you every day when you wake up. Sing for you whenever we listen to music. Who ugly cries when we fight. Who tells you the most random stories and science facts that I know. Of course, someone who always writes you corny-long-ass messages haha.

I'd remember you as the girl with a big, radiant energy that lights up the room. I'd always remember your pretty smile, and how I get kilig whenever I see it. I love it when you smile. I'd remember how you get so pissed whenever our place is so messy. Your sungit moments whenever I do something wrong. Your really good singing voice. Haha. Your kisses whenever I'm sad. Your back hugs to me.

Happy birthday, M. I wish you all the best and happiness in this life. May you remember that there's someone out there in the world who's cheering for you today - that's me :)

I had 1/2 tspn of matcha this morning with breakfast and then had a soda pop later.  Matcha is way less caffeine about 50mg so this is a big difference to my coffee.  Also It's a natural soda without caffeine.  Just trying to switch to sugar more for any energy.. like remember when we were kids we had that Tang or kool-aid? LOL

This has been a rough week to say the least. This past weekend I worked overnight at my nursing job, only to double over and fall off the toilet in pain. Due to staffing, this meant I had to finish out my shift and then head to the ED, where I got to find out I have GERD at the minimum and will need both an upper and lower endoscopy. In the lobby I made the world's most awkward eye contact with my supervisor who also happened to be there. 

I've been vomiting every day accept today, which leads us to yesterday actually. I finally feel okay in the morning and figure why don't I try to go out for coffee with my sister and dad. I hadn't left the house since the ED so I thought this would help. Only to vomit on myself in the car. Great start to the day at 8 AM. 

I go home, shower, and go back to bed. Fuck it right? Then my boyfriend calls in the afternoon. He breaks up with me because we've been distant (fair), but the entire conversation I'm trying to not barf. Whatever, right? It's a breakup, breakups happen every day. My dad comes up, banging on the door.

Our cat's dying, and he's letting me know so I can say goodbye. Started just coughing up blood. (He has been unwell, so this wasn't unexpected but damn.) So our family cat passes as comfortable as we can make him.

He clearly was trying to start a conversation, and we really couldn't find a way to tell him to leave, the fact we were so young and naive didn't help. He asked for our facebooks and my friends gave them to him. I had a bad feeling about him right away, and i was right. 
That same night he started texting us about making dinner plans and going to the carnival in town at the time, have in mind this man is like 7 years older than us. I immediately told my parents, who helped me send a text saying they didn't want me out with someone so much older etc. He didn't take the no easily, but what I didn't know at the time was how long this situation would last.
To try to describe it as simply as i can, because otherwise this post would be extremely long, from then on he would start stalking the three of us. After many interactions like the one I described above, but increasingly more stressful, we all blocked him. He then started messaging everyone he could find that knew us or went to the same school, also messaged family members. Went after random people from our social circles irl, went to one of the girls grandma's house to wait for her.
Over that summer, he would go to our middle school end of year party to ""check on our grades"", said he had packages waiting for us in a specific place. When we entered high school he went to one of them with a picture of us and asking people if they knew us and where we were, he even found out to what school my little sister went to and waited at the door for her. These are just examples, there were many more. I went to the police and they said there was nothing they could do, as usual.
His actions would soften with time, but even last year he texted the boyfriend of one of us, and at least once a year he creates like 3 new instagram accounts and tries to follow us and people we know.
His intent was never sexual or romantic though, what he wanted was for us to ""forgive him"", to unblock him and to be our friend. Which I think comes into play to why people sometimes don't see how scary this is.
My mom has told me several times I should feel sorry for him, because he is ""clearly unwell"". A few months ago she encountered him at a coffee shop i go to and even said to me something like ""just saw your dear friend"". Everytime I think I saw him, or he tries to approach us, or even the thought that he frequents the same places as me makes me panic.
But she does not get it, she doesn't see that for me it isn't over. That I spent my teens feeling watched and almost haunted by him, and that feeling never leaves you.
Today I saw him, and he saw me, on the bus. My heart immediately started to race, at the simple thought that he knows what I look like now.
I don't know if I'm being dramatic, he just terrifies me and people around me just can't see how desperating it is.

I am (M/23) and i currently live at my mothers house. I live here with my older sister (F/27) {not the sister in question} and we both have an older sister who lives in the same town as us. This sister (F/30) hasn’t exactly been great to us our whole lives. she is very manipulative and somehow makes herself to be the victim in every situation even when she is in the wrong. she despises everyone else in our family (we have a lot of other older siblings) and she especially despises my mother. 

this sister would constantly complain to me and my other sister about how horrible and traumatic her childhood was even though we have had vivid traumatic memories or her verbally and physically abusing us growing up, which i find ironic as hell. she used to tell us she would have dreams of our mother dying and it made her happy, well our mother does EVERYTHING for her. she hates our mother to the core and yet my mom drives her ass everywhere to do any errand she has and buys her coffee every single day. 
the (F/30) sister used to live with us roughly 4 years ago but she had to move out because of a huge fight her and my other (F/27) sister had, and decided she couldn’t stand living with us anymore but when asked about it now she claims she was “kicked out.” my other sister and my mother has offered her to come back multiple times and she always denies the offer LOL. 

anyways to cut to the point cause i could go all day she is just plain awful to deal with, i have a lot of traumatic memories of her of when she used to live with me to the point where i still have terrible nightmares about it. 

what initially caused me to cut her off before was because around the time before she moved out i had this really bad argument (i wont get into it but it was a really stupid situation that she heavily escalated) and it had brought me sobbing and writhing on the floor while she sat there and watched me cry with zero expression and then immediately told people i was threatening her or some shit and then days later didn’t like how the situation made her feel about herself and tried to buy me a cheap gift to somehow make up for the emotional damage. it was actually the most stupid situation ever and it made me realize truly how selfish and cold her soul is.

that was what initially caused me to cut her out of my life. but then in recent years my other sister and my mom would invite her at the house and at some point it felt awkward to not have contact with her since she would literally be sitting in my living room while i would be walking around my house. so after time went by i talked to her again and these past couple years up until now she has proven to be the same god awful person who still thinks her life is so much worse than everyone’s and could give a fuck less about anyone else. she still despises my mom even though she still continues to do literally everything for her and she calls my mom off the hook every damn day for her to do something for her. ridiculous…


what makes me want this advice of “should I cut her out for good?” is because this shit is continuing to seep into my nightmares. i had just woken up from yet another nightmare about her with my heart racing waking up to the feeling of complete fear. it’s been happening since having her back in contact again. sometimes it leads to me shouting myself out of my sleep. its not every single night but definitely enough to make nights sleepless. 

i don’t see her as often anymore but she will still text me from time to time ranting to me about our family or venting about more meaningless disputes or just sending me random things. it just feels weird to still have contact with her while i’m actively having nightmares about her abusive ways.

should I just block her and cut her off for good? 

NOTE: (obviously there will be times in life i will have to see her again cause unfortunately i’m related to her but i just cant keep pretending we are close and that I’m chill with her behaviour. theres other siblings in my family i barely ever speak with since i’m just not close to them at all)

These drones are acing their final approach with the precision of a drone whisperer, increasing strike success rates to the tune of 70 to 80 percent. Compare that to the humble human's 20 percent and you might start thinking about taking up model planes instead.

**Flying Ahead: Autonomy in the Skies**

Ukraine's military strategy is rapidly evolving to replace soldiers with these tech warriors, saving on human lives and, admittedly, upping that budget on drone workshops. But hold your enthusiasm: full autonomy is still a few blueprints away. For now, these AI companions are mostly there for those final stretch critical decisions, where even the most seasoned human pilot might second guess.

The impact? Significant. Fewer drones needed, fewer human skills demanded, and here’s the cherry on top—these flying hunks of metal can see through your typical battlefield trickery like it’s yesterday’s news.

**The Ethics of the Air**

But let's address the elephant in the room—or perhaps the drone in the sky: ethical concerns about killer robots becoming a weekend reality TV show. Ukraine, for the moment, is keeping engagement decisions firmly in human hands, ensuring that the buck doesn’t stop at the algorithm. 

Yet, with greater autonomy looming on the horizon and AI tech improving faster than you can say ""Skynet,"" this raises a fundamental question: is the line between human and machine getting more blurred by the day? 

So, Reddit, is this the dawn of a new era in warfare where machine replaces man—or does this vendetta against human-free targeting unleash a new Pandora’s box? What side of the drone divide do you stand on? Share your insights below!",1,1741374293.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

With the Hario, I was basically just cracking beans rather than properly grinding them. The X-Ultra produces consistent grounds with almost no fines at all.

The build quality feels extremely premium - perfect weight, well-balanced, and precisely engineered. In my opinion, it's aesthetically the prettiest hand grinder on the market.

I was hesitant to purchase after reading online concerns about production errors leading to callbacks, differences from the previous X-Pro model, and issues with the magnetic cup falling off during grinding. I can confirm my magnetic cup stays firmly in place with no problems.

There seems to be way less content about the X-Ultra compared to other 1ZPresso models, which added to my hesitation. What ultimately convinced me was reading that most testers couldn't distinguish between the cup quality of the X-Ultra and K-Ultra in blind tastings.

Two days in, and the clarity in my cup is on another level compared to what I was getting with the Hario. It's like tasting coffee properly for the first time.

Will post a more detailed update in a month after I've had more time with it. Any other X-Ultra enthusiasts here? How has your experience been?",11,1741374280.0,pourover,1,0.92,False

Is anyone else's Nmom like this??
For more context, I've had POTS symptoms, textbook, for a good while now. I was feeling really bad one night and hoping someone would check up on me, my heart wouldn't stop racing. She rushed into my room, I was actually relieved. She said she was watching a video (some holistic dr she likes) that was talking about vitamin d overdose and she was sure I had it. Symptoms are slightly similar. So we rushed to the ER. The dr cocks his head to the side and goes ""it's almost impossible to overdose on vitamin d, especially in that quantity. It could be POTS"". We go home, and she continues to treat me for vit D overdose because ""the dr was wrong"". My vitamin D ends up being perfectly fine. Then she starts believing it's POTS but scours for the root cause. Mold Exposure? Checked that, likely not. It's the caffeine in coffee that affects me, not the mycotoxins. We get an air purifier for my room just in case. We start treating my condition like it's POTS. Salt, water, Liquid IV, a balance of rest/activity. It's going swimmingly, (ofc w some good and some bad days, that's how it goes with chronic illness). We go to a dr's appt. The dr says it's POTS convincingly (she's very knowledgeable in that area). We go home, and my mom is watching holistic dr's again. 

All of a sudden, she once again comes inti my room looking for my last lab results. My B1 must be too low. I must have a thiamine deficiency. (which is beriberi??) Because of all the other times she had ""convincing"" leads, i take it, as i always have everything, with a grain of salt and look into it myself. Not likely. Very serious and very rare. Wet brain, anorexia, and a plethora of symptoms I dont have. I try to talk to her about it, and all of a sudden she starts yelling at me that it seems I don't wanna get better. ""I don't know if it's an excuse to stay locked up in your room, or if it's for attention, but it's not cute, it looks ugly, and your attitude stinks. You complain all day about 'oh, my heart this, oh i feel sick', and it's sickening."" I would tell her symptoms throughout the day so A) we can document it and B) she would make me do something when im feeling ill because she'd go ""well i didnt hear you complaining earlier, all of a sudden i send you to do something and you feel sick?"". And I would obly bring it up when, yes you guessed it, I felt at my worst like I was gonna pass out or throw up. Some days are better than others, so she gets annoyed at me on my bad days because I tell her I cant do much. I also told her I was expressing my concern because I don't want beriberi. It seems very scary. She goes ""oh, so get the less serious disease and still complain all day then. You don't think I'm worried for you? I'm researching left and right. I ask DOCTORS [we have a doctor friend] if it's a good lead to look into before I ask you, because you always go 'no, i dont think so, no i researched' and it makes me not even wanna talk to you. You never wanna look into the things I say, you just wanna stay sick. You're know-it-all behavior is ungrateful and rude"". And I'm just very upset and confused?? I look into the things she says, I try them, and they simply dont work other than salt, water, and Liquid IV. She says she's concerned, but then says I'm being dramatic, lacking faith, and doing extra for attention. And then she empathizes with me for the rest of the day, telling me I should go out with friends. 
I don't want her research, I just need her to understand I need to rest. I can't do the things I used to do. Even when I cleaned the whole house top to bottom every day, there was some sort of complaint. ""Well you should cook more"". I really can't exhert my energy anymore, it's killing me. Anyone else?

For the background information, I never had good relationship with either of my parents. Although I still appreciate their efforts to raise me. Now I (18F) live abroad.

Firstly, I started to notice that something was off when dad started to go out more often and became more into sport from being completely inactive. It started a few years ago, and I didn’t give it much thought since I was more focused on moving out. Then whenever I would ask my dad to go out to some nice places in the city, he would easily find “modern” restaurants or coffee shops that he wouldn’t usually like. And when I asked him how he knew about them he said he went there during lunch with coworkers. 
It sounded normal, before I realised that firstly, he is extremely occupied at work that he can’t even return my calls (he is a surgeon), and is not the type of person to go out randomly. 


So, once, while we were sitting at one of the restaurants he knew, he was showing me something on his phone. When the same woman texted him twice smth like “Mew” or “Mur” (the sound of cat), I didn’t think much of it because it was only once. Then not too long ago, during Christmas break, my dad was driving me in his car when I noticed a ring. When my dad couldn’t see, I took at to see the size, and it was really small, so it couldn’t be my mom’s or mine. I putted it back, so he wouldn’t notice anything. By the way, he is not a type of person that goes out with friends or drives everyone around. And he does not have any female friends besides my mom’s. 
Moreover, I already felt uncomfortable with all of this stuff, since I don’t have direct proof of an affair, but I just know there is one. 


Then I went on a trip with him to mountains, where he had his surgeons conference and I had my stuff to do there. 
While his colleagues were driving us to the destination he was texting someone for a long time. I glanced at his screen once, and it was the same woman, and the same “Mew” and other longer messages. 
Long story short, I met her at the conference, she had small fingers, and she is in her 30s. She likes active life and is a pleasant person. 


The most weird part is that they text a lot, like, A LOT, and they didn’t even speak to each other in front of me, in my opinion it is a red flag and they are hiding something. 


Now, the problem isn’t in investigating it further, but rather if I find out more about it, do i tell my mom? She has depression and anxiety and she is currently writing the final article for her phd and I don’t think she will be able to deal with it, without proper support. 


And am I being delusional? Do I really make it all up in my head? 

He is not very loyal person, and almost never shows the affection or tries to spend some time with the family. He always works or is training. Or just goes somewhere for a few hours and doesn’t tell anyone anything. And at the same time, with little time for anything, he knows a lot of restaurants, even in those cuisines he despises.

I liked this girl for about 7 months now. There was a little event in my village, where all of us just get together, have a bbq, beer and chat. We started chatting and I noticed that she was looking at me interested. There was my brother and cousin aswell, so we were talking like this since there was noone else in our age. 

After that, we didn't really see nor talk to each other. We met a few times in a bus, but thats all. Last christmas, I made up my courage to text her via ig. We were texting about random stuff and it seemed to me that she liked chatting w me. I once mentioned that I go on walks quite often and she asked me, if I would go on a walk w her. Naturally, I said yes. 

So we ended up going for walks like once a week and similiar stuff, like coffee. She invited me to go on a concert w her (both of us listen to metal🤘) and of course, I accepted. 

This phase lasted about 2 months. About a week ago, we went on a prom of my school. We were chatting, just the two of us since there wasnt many of my friends. And then, the dancing part started. About 4 songs into it,  asked her to dance. So we started dancing and we chatted a bit. And then a quiet bit came. We just looked into each other eyes. And then, she kissed me. 

Turns out, she had a bigass crush on me aswell. After we kissed, we settled that we are dating from now on. Since then, we were out a couple of times and I am having a time of my life.

WAT topic: WFH- a win-win for everyone! (25 mins)

The verification process was very rigorous for this one, and went on for a long period of time.

For the PI, there were 2 panelists, both mate and in their mid 40s, one was very friendly while the other seemed pretty grumpy (could be the long hours of taking an interview since I went in 2nd last in the panel)

1. Tell me something about yourself.

2. My job duties and role at Starbucks(as an MT)

3. Why leaving it? Why not continuing in hospitality?

4. Why do you want to pursue MBA?

5. Promote(market) coffee, in terms of management aspects.

6. Point out 2 things in the hotel room(where the interview was taking place) that can be improved/changed, and comes to your notice as an HM graduate.

7. After MBA would you like to go back and work in the hospitality sector?

8. What made you switch from hospitality to management?

9. According to you, what's the biggest issue our country is facing right now?

I'm visiting Phoenix and Tucson soon and have some down time over the weekend before heading home. I don't know anyone in the area. So my options are walking around the cities, hiking even more than I already am, or meeting someone new and interesting.

The latter option seems like the most interesting. Why not take that chance?

Let's chat (text, phone, whatever), swap pics, figure out where to meet and get drinks, and that's it. We'll talk and become besties. We're only hanging out for a couple of hours, right? We probably won't ever talk again. 

This isn't some creepy bait-and-switch where I'm trying to get laid. I would just prefer drinks with a new friend than drinks alone.

If it helps, I've met people from Reddit before and it's (almost) always a positive experience. I'm educated and love my work. I'm respectful of people I'm around. I read a lot. I have amazing stories. I would love to hear your stories. If I learn something new, even better. 

Drinks/food would be on me, obviously.

Let's chat! Tell me about yourself. Ask whatever questions you have. Tell me your deep dark secrets over margaritas and coffee and whatever else people in Arizona consume.",1,1741373178.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

To the kind Redditor from Wellington who sent me this gorgeous artistic postcard—thank you so much! I truly appreciate it. 🙂

I loved reading what you wrote about your city—it was fascinating to learn more about it. I have to agree with you: Wellington is truly one of the most beautiful places on Earth. I also love views of the sea, so I’d definitely enjoy visiting for a holiday someday. It was also great to read about Māori culture and Matariki. Fun fact: I once saw a Māori statue on display at the Presidential Palace in Singapore! It was a gift from the New Zealand government to Singapore.

I also enjoyed learning about ANZAC Day—it’s heartwarming to see how your country honors its war heroes. In Singapore, we have a memorial and a museum dedicated to the Australian and New Zealand soldiers who fought in the war. It’s called the Changi Chapel & Museum.

I had no idea Wellington was such a coffee-loving city! Thank you for sharing that little tidbit. 

Once again, thank you for kindly sending me this card—I truly appreciate it! Wishing you all the best in your endeavors. I hope Singapore and New Zealand will continue to be close friends for decades to come! 

A big thank you to the mods as well.

1j5wbts,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1j5wbts/looking_to_add_another_card_with_better_than_15/,Looking to add another card with better than 1.5% cashback,"FICO: 747 TransUnion (per Discover), 735 Experian (Per Amex), 750 Equifax (per CreditKarma)

Current cards: Chase Freedom Unlimited (opened September 2023, limit $4400), Discover it Cashback (opened June 2023, limit $2800), Amex Blue Cash Everyday, retail card for my employer (September 2024, limit $4100—only did it because you don't get your discount with other credit providers, using gift cards can be kind of a pain, and no debit option online)

Cards get paid in full every month

Income: $17,500 for myself in the past year (18.15 hourly, not including from selling things) and something like $100k from my dad, mom with sporadic income which pays for most utilities and groceries

Average monthly spend: ranges widely from $400 to over $1000, but on the increase since I finished college

Oldest credit card: 1 year 9 months (history goes further with subsidized loan 4 years 8 months ago)

Banks: Chase Private Client checking (dad and grandma have CPC so I guess I do to because I had a custodial account back in the day), SoFi High Yield Savings/Checking, Discover Cashback Debit, passbook account with Ridgewood Savings Bank **EDIT:** IRA and individual investment accounts with Schwab. Wayyy below $250k though so no fee Amex Platinum lol

My current setup works decently well for me, but I'm wondering if another card can come into the mix to do a bit better. I don't have a whole lot of expenses because I live at home with my family still, so contributions I make are often through giving cash or Zelle. My main spending is really on hobbies, which is why the BCE was a great choice—the 3% on online shopping is great for my current spending habits. The Discover was my first card and I mostly use it for the rotating categories, and I have the CFU for non-category purchases and dining. I don't drive (don't worry I am an adult just don't like driving) but occasionally pay for family members' gas, which BCE covers. When I was in college I took public transit a lot, but I'm out of that now, and further my employer provides a free $100 on debit for public transit, and I'm cheap and thus don't use much ridesharing.

So—the main area I'm looking to cover in in-person shopping. Thrifting is one of my hobbies, and the most cash back I can get back with my current setup the most I can get at those is 5%. I also do get coffee from Starbucks inside Target or Barnes and Noble because both are in the same parking lot as my job, which don't code as dining and again aren't covered by categories.

I've been eyeing the Amex Blue Business Cash because it gives 2% flat and is with a provider I already have. The ""business"" could be justified, if need be, as reselling thrifted items, since I do after all do that from time to time. The US Bank Cash+ is also intriguing, but I don't think any particular two 5% categories work to maximize the cashback, and the 2% categories are all ones I get better rates for from other cards, so I'd probably just wind up with another 1% most of the time. And there's also the SoFi card, although I don't love being tied to having my account with them for the 2%.

(Amex keeps targeting me for the Platinum and Gold cards—175k points for 8k spend in six months for Platinum and 100k for 6k spend in six months—but given I'm in my early 20s, work an hourly retail job, and don't travel much, want to use rewards for statement credit or to cash out, and don't really even spend that much, that doesn't make much sense. I could of course start using ridesharing more and dine out more and stop being cheap, but changing my life around the credit card probably isn't the wisest idea.)

Anyway, a bit long winded here, but I was curious what people have to say—should I go for the Blue Business Cash? SoFi? Maybe something else? Or just leave it as-is? (Worth noting it's probably best I don't open with yet another provider just for simplicity's sake—while I do use YNAB to track everything, the offer would have to be pretty compelling for me to start making it even more complicated.)",2,1741372785.0,CreditCards,3,1.0,False
1j5warl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1j5warl/my_biological_dad_ive_never_met_followed_me_home/,My Biological dad i've never met followed me home.,"Up until I was 12 years old I thought my dad was my biological dad. His mom and my step mom would rage about how alike we are. They would talk about how we have the same moles and I've heard the 

“ Yep that's definitely your daughter. “ comment growing up. 



When I was 12 my family sat me down and told me my dad wasn't my biological dad. They explained that my dad was unable to have kids so they did invitro fertilization. ( spoiler they didn't ) I didn't care and low key forgot they told me.



Fast forward to when i was 15, i live with my mom and step dad now and have social media and i got a dm on instagram from a girl claiming she's my sister. I didn't believe her because that's not possible and nobody knows who my bio dad is because it was a donor. 



She started telling me stuff about my life that nobody knew besides close family. She knew my dad who raised me by name. My mom told me she lives nearby and i was like oh okay yeah this is legit i guess. 



We met and I asked her if she was a donor baby like me. She looked really confused and told me that that's NOT what happened.



From this point forward ill call my “donor” dad Shawn



My mom, dad, stepdad, and Shawn were all friends before I was conceived and my mom and dad came to him and told him that they wanted to have kids but my dad was unable. They didn't have the money for doctors or anything like that to do it the normal way so my mom and Shawn did the deed and I was conceived. 



When i was born shawn held me and from what others have told me he felt love for me that was a problem for him so he made a deal with my mom and dad that he would stop being their best friend and drop contact so they could raise me without him standing over their shoulder and just secretly being my bio dad. So that's what he did.



Me and my dad dont have the best relationship and he lives hundreds of miles away and has another kid now. I have a lot of sadness built up from just wanting my dad and wanting to have a relationship with him but it's just so hard.



I cried and cried one night and got angry and found Shawn on facebook and sent him a message. I just introduced myself and asked him if he knew my mom and dad. 



He was very kind and we talked for hours and even talked on the phone. We planned a coffee meetup just to talk but he never went through with it. We kept talking for a few weeks and then he asked how my dad and mom were doing. He wanted their numbers so he could reconnect  with them as well.



I told my dad I found him like a dummy and he was upset and said he hoped I never found out. I asked him if I could give him shawns number and I did and then radio silence from shawn.



I texted for a few weeks into the void of shawns old number. Randomly checking in. 

No answer. My mom and I think my dad may have told Shawn to screw off and stop talking to me but it just hurts because how is my dad mad for him talking to me when he doesn't do it himself either?



I started to get frustrated because now I have THREE dads who dont talk to me. Sometime went by and i found my grandfather ( shawn's dad ) on people finder and found his number and literally called him. The point of finding him was for my family tree that I'm working on. I just needed his birthday.



I talked to his dad for like 30 minutes trying to explain who i am because apparently nobody in shawn's family knew about me either besides his other kids. His dad told me that he would call Shawn and just verify me and the story. Then again radio silence from both Shawn and his dad.



His dad was so excited on the phone he seemed upbeat and happy to find out about me so i don't understand what keeps happening. I'm not a tweaker or a bum who's only reaching out for something. I made that very very clear multiple times. I just want to get to know my blood and finish my family tree. I don't want to be there for christmas or fathers day i deadass just want to be on talking terms with my long lost family. But as an outsider to the family I totally understand why they would be suspicious of me. 



Fast forward again to a few days ago. I work on Rover doing house sits for people in my city and my mom was dropping me off for a house sit. She casually mentioned that Shawn lives in this neighborhood. 



My mom and i are best friends so i looked at her and she looked at me and we drove around the neighborhood looking for volkswagen beetles ( Shawn works on volkswagens and has loved them for like 30 years. ) She then looked his name up on people finder and we found his address. 



We didn't have a plan, we just wanted to drive past his house. Maybe if I was lucky he would be outside and I could lay my eyes on him just once in my life. 



Sure enough we found his house and his garage was open and there were tools all over the driveway and yep a volkswagen bus in his garage that he was working on. 



There he was standing in his garage looking down at his phone. We drove past slowly all giggly and laughing and he actually looked up and made eye contact with us. We just stared at each other. He didn't know what I looked like but he for sure knew what my mom looked like.



We drive off and notice he's driving behind us. He's following us. He followed us for like 5 miles and I begged my mom to pull over to see if he would. But she didn't. It was him he knew it was us and he followed us almost all the way back to my house. 



Here's what i think:



1. My dad told him to cut contact with me so he wouldn't mess up anything fragile
2. Shawn has a wife and he doesn't want her to find out about me.
3.  He's scared of getting emotionally hurt like he did with his other kids ( His words )
4. He thinks i'm a tweaker and want something from him



Final words, I love my dad ( one who raised me ). Phones work both ways, so us not calling each other for over 6 months is not just me being an asshole, YOU dad can also call me anytime. I love him with all my heart but it's such a strained relationship. Me connecting to Shawn wasn't out of spite of my dad or because I want a new dad. Maybe I just want to know illnesses that run in the family and maybe genetic stuff I might have that I otherwise would have no idea about. And yeah I'll admit maybe it would be nice to get to know shawn. But my dad doesnt get to decide that for me, I'm 21 years old. If I want to do it on my own I will. And I did, I tried. But there's only so much you can do right?

Use color and shape to form artistic creations from spirals of paper. Whether you create a work inspired by nature or abstract in design, quilling is a creative medium sure to inspire a masterpiece. Painter and quilling artist Sue Hossack will be teaching and demonstrating quilling techniques in this workshop, showing how to use the quilling tools to effectively create perfect spirals of paper. All art supplies, including paper, glue, board, and quilling tools, are included with registration. After the workshop, you get to keep the quilling tools to take home and make more art. Limited space is available. No prior experience with quilling is necessary; this workshop is accessible to all skill levels.

If someone is not a student/disciple of Spiritual Master Saneiv, they are NOT Enlightened in any way, shape or form. Whether someone believes this or not, is irrelevant because disbelief does not change Truth","[Apparently A.I. thinks that this is an accurate image of Spiritual Master Saneiv...](https://preview.redd.it/3a4hy32nabne1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=408b58046bc4b02c5be5ed6d0ad6054221d571da)

**Question Asked of Spiritual Master Saneiv; How is an awakening not the same as full enlightenment?**

**Awakening is the realization that there is ONE enlightened spiritual master in the world,**

**and that you need to do whatever is necessary to be under His guidance. Master Saneiv ( Marigi nun**

**KaramOxO ) is the ONE enlightened master. If there is only ONE enlightened spiritual master, therefore**

**you will never attain true enlightenment outside of Master Saneiv. There is no such stage or level as “full enlightenment” …you are either Enlightened or you are not… “full enlightenment” is nonsense. It’s a**

**business and/or cult tactic to keep you coming back and paying for their classes, always after the**

**proverbial full enlightenment, that doesn’t exist.**

**There is no such thing as a positive “kundalini awakening” , you are either involved in a true spiritual awakening or you are not…considering that no one on earth can have a true spiritual awakening outside of the teachings of spiritual master saneiv, therefore no one on earth can attain true spiritual enlightenment outside of master saneiv. Rather than following a “guru” con man, fraud, etc. who is nothing but the blind leading the blind, and usually the wolf teaching the sheep…how many male gurus have had two things on their mind; 1) getting in your pants for sex 2) getting in your pants for your wallet.**

**the “credential” list above says; “Saneiv is Solus Dominus, Latin for ONE Lord and Master”…which is very true. Master Sane is also; Marigi nun KaramOxO … Do you know what your life purpose is ? Even though many people claim that “no one has ever known what happens to you when you die and where you will go”…this is NOT true. Spiritual Master Saneiv knows. This is your “Mantra” Marigi nun KaramOxO ( and the OxO does not represent hugs and kisses, even though that can be a very positive experience ), when you repeat “Marigi nun KaramOxO” the results are only related to having your meditation prayer answered , and the prayer request is “ I want to follow the true enlightened spiritual master, and no one else except the ONE true God . When you receive your answer in the spirit that is telling you to go to spiritual master saneiv, embrace him in the spirit and dedicate yourself to His teachings and you will attain true spiritual enlightenment…then you must act on this Truth. Your answer will most likely not be in audible form. God is Spirit and must be worshipped in Spirit, and Spirit does not speak in an audible voice to humans who have not reached Enlightenment yet. God as Spirit, Spirit-Humans and Unenlightened Humans can communicate without an audible language, if they come to Spiritual Master Saneiv in a spirit of submission, obedience…which will manifest as Service to Master Saneiv.**

**Master Saneiv, is ONE with God, but is not God.**

**Saneiv Spiritual Enlightenment Center, a unique spiritual co-op community nestled in the heart of Apache Junction, Arizona, emerges as a sanctuary for spiritual seekers. Led by Master Saneiv, the only enlightened spiritual master in the world, the center offers private instruction designed to guide individuals on their path toward spiritual awakening. Embark on a transformative journey with Saneiv, exploring the depths of spirituality and unlocking the potential for profound personal growth.**

I reduced my coffee until I was at 2 tea spoons a day. Then I stopped completely for 3 days. After 3 days I had a little coffee i.e. 1 tea spoon full mixed with some decaf. And I was a lot more tired than in the last few days. It's crazy. Now I know for sure that coffee is not for me. 

Without coffee my skin improved aswell, well partly also due to other changes but I'm sure it helped it 20-30 percent. ",5,1741372354.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

 I had some rough ideas for slimes that could be based off the show and I don’t have a slime shop so I thought I’d throw them here in the hopes that they could inspire someone:

Hextech slime:

Shimmery blue coated clear with clear add ins

(Maybe kind of like Library of Slime’s The Emerald City slime (which is so gorgeous btw) but blue?)

the scent would have to be something complex but unassuming, maybe like blueberries and some other outdoorsy scents?

Hexcore slime:

Super pigmented color shifting pigment with different sized clear silica sand beads and lava rock

no idea about scent!

Metal fortune cookie slime (because of Jinx’s nickname for Viktor):

Cloud crème sand slime, pale fortune cookie color, topped with glitter and comes with a fortune cookie clay piece that’s either coated with glitter or gold leaf 

Scented fresh baked spiced cookies

Man of Progress slime:

(themed kind of after the coffee cup)

Has Jayce’s man of progress photo on the front 

Scented coffee and something else? Coffee and smoke maybe?

Shimmer slime:

Coated lightly pigmented purple color shifting clear with pink glitter and silica sand 

no idea about scent!

Ekko slime:

Off white white glue slime (thick n glossy or cloud crème or butter) scented tree bark and maybe something a little sweet, like maple potentially’

Other ideas:

There could be a lava rock slime themed after Blisters and Bedrock

Heavy is the Crown could be a slime with heavy glass beads

A Jinx slime would have to have a bunch of different scent notes, sweet and something else

A black rose slime could obviously incorporate the color black and rose scent

Please let me know if you have any other ideas or if anyone has made slimes based on this show, I’d love to see them",9,1741372207.0,Slime,4,1.0,False
1j5w2xs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5w2xs,Good Karma Coffee Decaf - help! [Lelit Bianca V2 and Eureka Mignon Specialata],"Hey fellow espresso nerds.
I need your help with this new coffee I ordered.
It drives me crazy.


It's a decaf by Good Karma Coffee. I saw that they were recommended from someone here and wanted  to try them as they roast fresh.
So I got a bag of it with roast date 19.02.25. I'd rather say it's a dark roast as it's also advertised as dark, and compared to my previous Coffee it's darker.


But no matter what I do it's unenjoyable.
I managed to bring it from awful sour to ""ok"", mostly by lowering the temperature, going from 1:2 to 1:2.5, overloading my basket to 16,5g and reducing flow.
And yes, I grinded finer. And finer. Im now on a setting where I cannot go finer. If I do, burrs touch.
I'm currently at 31s for the shot.


Also it does not build durable crema.  I don't care much for the crema, but I find it strange that fresh beans don't create a crema.


Here's my setup:
Lelit Bianca V2 (Offset Corrected)
Eureka Mignon Specialata Single Dosing Upgrade with 3D printed bigger dial and corrected Burr alignment.
Normcore Tamper
Normcore Puck Screen 1,7mm
VST 15g Basket, but also tried the 18g VST and IMS 18g...
WDT
No RDT


Any advice is welcome. Thank you in advance.",2,1741372197.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1j5vzh3,https://v.redd.it/xes9dcau8bne1,"I’m making hot water, not coffee","Alright, folks, I need your collective wisdom (or just a little emotional support).

My Keurig has officially entered its rebellious teenage phase. It still looks like a coffee maker, still acts like a coffee maker, but has decided it no longer wants to make actual coffee. Instead, it’s just brewing…hot water. That’s it. Just steamy disappointment in a cup.

I’ve done everything: unplugged it, cleaned the needles (a dozen times), descaled it, whispered sweet nothings to it—nothing. It stabs the pods like it’s got a personal vendetta, but then refuses to let any water flow through.

So tell me, is my Keurig dead? Is there some secret coffee maker CPR I don’t know about? Or do I need to start a support group for people betrayed by their appliances? Help me before I resort to instant coffee…",5,1741371968.0,keurig,6,1.0,False

I wake up every morning with a singular goal: ensuring that when you try to find that one email from three weeks ago, it will be easier to just scroll back in your inbox three weeks instead of using the search function.  
  
And this is how I do it, starting with a strict morning routine:

* First thing in the morning, I log into Outlook myself and test the search function—just to make sure it’s *still* bad. If I can find an email on the first try, I know I have work to do.
* I start the day with a stand-up meeting where we brainstorm fresh ways to make search even worse. Some recent ideas:
   * Prioritizing completely irrelevant emails from five years ago.
   * Making sure searching for an exact phrase *never* returns an exact match.
   * Making sure than when you search the exact name of the person you're looking for that they don't return a result.
   * Ensuring that attachment searches return random PDFs you’ve never seen before.

# That's just to start the day. Once i get my third cup of coffee in, then it's time to go for the daily tasks:

* I dedicate a good chunk of my day tweaking how filters work. A fan-favorite is ensuring that filtering by ""Last Week"" returns results from 2017.
* Did you type ""invoice"" instead of ""Invoice""? Sorry, nothing found.
* You think turning on Indexing actually works? hahahahahahahaa
* What’s more frustrating than bad search results? Waiting 30 seconds for bad search results.
* We’ve programmed search to assume you meant something *entirely different*. Searching for ""contract""? Here are some emails containing ""tractor"" and ""contact""—hope that helps.

# We're open to suggestions, but some of the near-term goals we have are:

* Instead of returning relevant emails, it will randomly select an email from your archive, just for fun.
* Searching for emails will occasionally return an entirely different user's inbox. (Legal hasn’t signed off on this yet, but we’re working on it.)

Tapeworm segments or sesame seeds?,"So, a couple of hours ago I went to the bathroom and pooped, as normal, but when I got up after washing and was about to flush I looked closer and noticed dozens of tiny white specks in my poop, like, a bunch of them scattered about. I got really scared because I had an idea that tapeworm segments come out like those tiny white specks. However, then I went on google and it said that while it may be a symptom of tapeworm, it can also be undigested food such as seeds. Now, for context, for the past two days I've been eating rather large wings my mother makes that are covered in sesame seeds, its most of what I've been eating since its Ramadan and nothing much else is made, the last thing I ate today before a short nap was a bunch of those sesame seed covered wings as well, and today's batch had way more seeds on them than yesterday and I ate the most of them, then I had a coffee a while before I pooped, so I had eaten nothing since those wings. So, I thought I would come here and ask for other's opinion, was it actually just the seeds? For further information, I don't eat pork or beef, I ate fish and some shrimps a month or two ago, but so did the rest of my family and the food was well cooked, since the shrimp were covered in batter and fried, and the fish was grilled, though I don't know how much that protects you. There have been no other instances of white specks in my poop even since eating all that seafood or even before (since we eat fish in some way every year in the winter), not even once, and I know because my paranoid self always checks very closely (with my naked eye), its only something I saw today. I always wash my hands thoroughly, even if I get the smallest thing on them, and I use water to clean my butt after pooping as opposed to toilet paper and I barely have to touch to clean it. Me and my family have been drinking the same water from the same company (Gourmet (Pakistani brand) and Nestle water) for over a decade now, and for the most part everyone's fine. Could really use some help since I'm feeling a bit paranoid and worried. Will answer question and will update if I see anything next time I use the bathroom.",1,1741371813.0,poop,0,0.99,False

1j5vwix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1j5vwix/feeling_like_a_bad_mom_needing_reassurance/,"Feeling like a bad mom, needing reassurance?","Hi! Someone on reddit posted about their daily schedules and I got my butt handed to me that I let my son (14 month old) have a mix of independent and one-on-one play with the tv on in the background for like 1.5 hours in the morning time. It's not every single morning, mind you, but it made me feel like a steaming pile of poo. It was only one person who said anything, but boy did they let me have it!

  
For reference, here's a rough outline of our schedule:

7am: wake up, diaper & clothing change, teeth brushed, and breakfast

8am: play time (independent and one-on-one), coffee time, hang out time while tv is on. (Son will watch for maybe 15 minutes total, the rest of the time it's just background noise. I put on Bluey, Franklin, or Bear in the Big Blue House.)

9am: mom gets ready while baby plays in bathroom

9:30am: play time or leave time (to store, playground, etc.)

11am: lunch

11:30am: nap

2pm: play time (both independent and one-on-one, usually have music playing in background)

4:45/5pm: starting cooking dinner with toddler playing in kitchen cabinets - Tupperware, bowls, pots and pans, etc.

5:30pm: eat dinner

6pm: bath, teeth brushed, and get jammies on

6:15pm: tv time, playtime with Dad

6:45/7pm: bedtime



Help me out, fellow Moms. Am I not doing enough for my son? Am I being a bad or negligent parent? Is that person just being a big meanie? I am currently 19 weeks pregnant and EXTRA sensitive, but I am normally a very sensitive person in the first place and don't know if I'm overreacting or legit not doing enough for my son.

About a year ago or so one day I had a get together type of party with a couple of my friends and I wanted to dress up so wore a crop top and a mini skirt which he didn't like and asked me to go for tracks which I didn't listen, It was also in the night(about 9:30 pm) and I wanted to walk because it was just a few km away but he insisted on dropping me there himself as it was not safe so late but I didn't like it so we got into a minor argument but it pissed me off way more than it should have and idk what took over me but I slapped him and told him ""I will not live my life on your terms"" And he was hurt, I regretted it immediately and apologized but he just left without saying a single word. Ever since then everything died down, He became very distant, he stopped asking about my days, My plans, Basically completely stopped caring about me, we were very close before but now our relationship became very formal. I have tried to fix it so many times, I apologized so many times, He tells me that he has forgiven me but his actions don't say it, He is not like before and even now when I bring it up he gets mad and tells me not to bring it up because he forgave me but I know he didn't. I held out hope for so long because he's the love of my life, Nobody has ever treated me like he did, Never once shout at me, Never once hit me, I even did so well in my boards and entrance exams because of him lol but now today I asked to meet for coffee or something because it's been like a week since we last saw each other but he told me he was busy and had plans but later I saw him online in discord streaming something and that crushed me, It hurts and I have been crying since.

Just recieved my df64 gen 2 today. Used it a couple of times. Big change to my workflow as I had been using the built in grinder in my sage machine.

One thing I've noticed is that the little cup doesn't fit into my portafilter so takes a while to transfer the ground coffee and does make a little mess.

Does anyone have any suggestions for accessories that might help the process?

Mine didn't come with the extra part I've seen people put on top of the df64 cup.

I’m 19 and living in New York. I’ve been on my own for the past year, and while I enjoy my independence, I’m ready to find a serious partner to build a future with. I share my space with my cat Whiskers, who keeps me company, but I’m craving a deeper human connection... i want a romantic bond with someone who gets me.

New York is an incredible city, but it can feel overwhelming and lonely at times. I’ve embraced my independence since moving out, but I miss having someone to share meaningful moments with. Whiskers is my constant companion, always curling up with me or trailing behind, but I’d love to meet someone who adores animals and enjoys deep conversations that go beyond purrs.

In my downtime, I love diving into books, watching movies, and exploring the city. I’m drawn to cozy cafes and unique eateries, savoring good coffee and fresh flavors. I enjoy strolling through Central Park, especially in autumn, and I’d love to find someone to share these moments with. Nature amid the urban sprawl is my escape, and it would be wonderful to have a partner to experience it together.

I work as a barista and genuinely enjoy it. Chatting with customers while crafting their drinks brightens my day, but I’m looking for someone to build a deeper bond with, a confidant and companion who’s there for more than just small talk.
