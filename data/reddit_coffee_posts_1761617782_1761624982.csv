1ohzwvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ohzwvc/i_29m_got_a_text_from_my_26f_girlfriends_coworker/,I 29M got a text from my 26F girlfriends coworker 25F,"
Update #3: original and updates are down below. It’s a novel. 

Well. Put another W on the Reddit board for comments being right. It’s been an absolute roller coaster of a weekend. Followed through with the thoughts I was having Friday night. I ended it right after work. See update #2, forgot I wrote that. I said all of the things I was willing to look past for someone that I could continue to work with through our relationship. That all changed when I found she had eyes outside of the relationship. I held true and didn’t let her know who told me. She was caught off guard obviously, had tons of questions, wanted to know if we could just work on this and that she didn’t know how I ended up where I was. I left for the night, luckily I have a travel van. I spent the day prepping and getting ready to spend as long as I needed in the van. The dog and I left. I went straight to the gym to condition the pain away. I spent the night not knowing if I made the biggest mistake of my life. 

I went back around 2 the next day after she got off. We agreed we would talk Saturday to discuss logistics. I came in and she was already on the couch and she had a list of questions. Most of it boiled down to she didn’t accept that I made this decision and I wasn’t even willing to let her know what the text actually said and what she actually did. Little did I know then. I shared the text with her. I listened to her explain, a lot of it made sense. She said a lot of things about the coworkers which were true over the years of working with her, about a bit of the conflict the coworker has caused, a bit about how things were taken out of context and that she said she doesn’t talk to her but she was talking to the other coworker who she is good friends with. I was convinced. I wanted it all to be non existent and work on my relationship with the woman I love. 

We made a plan to talk about all the things I brought up and how she can start to feel emotionally attached in the relationship again on Sunday. I had a Halloween party that night and her group of friends were planning to go to said swing bar we from the message. We had a great night. Ended it with some McDonald’s on the way home and a bit more than a happy meal once there. 

The itch wasn’t scratched. There I was sitting eating McDonald’s and she was asleep/dead to the world and her phone sitting right there. I couldn’t help myself. I looked. I wish I never picked up that phone. I have to tell myself I am. I searched, nothing, nothing, nothing for the longest time. Almost convinced I was wrong all along. Maybe a little jab here and there but nothing truly hurtful or meant to be mean. Nothing I wouldn’t expect to be said in front of me. 

Then I found a screenshot from ChatGPT (wild to screenshot this). September 27th 

“So I do have moments where I look at my boyfriend and think “wow he's such a good guy and I am still physically attracted to him” and I don't see myself pursuing this new guy long term.. BUT he is giving me attention and validation and compliments and time. I told him last night that even if I broke up with my current boytriend I would probably stay single”

Red. Immediately red. I’m laying next to her, this was taken the first day I left the country for work. I knew exactly who it was. She had watched a dog for this guy back in early September. That’s exactly where I went. Couldn’t find the contact that I know was there because I had an uneasy feeling the first time she met up to discuss logistics with the guy. Interesting. So I went to rover, found the phone number. Searched the number. Jess. Hmm that’s not his name or the dogs name. Which I know was in there. Blocked! Interesting. No messages. No deleted messages. Nothing. Peep the recently deleted photos, picture from October 5th of him sitting on the back of his car with his dog after a soccer game. That’s our anniversary. I sent flowers, chocolates all of her favorite things that day. Did everything I could from a different hemisphere. Hardly got anything that day, chalked it up to “yeah I deserve a shallow response, I’ve been gone” and tried harder. Tried to convince her to come meet me on the tail end so we could go explore a different country. Didn’t want to take time off work. 

All the dots connected. Found some other stuff between her friends but mostly just stuff about us. I left. I had to, drove down the street. Shouldn’t have driven but I had to leave, called my friend luckily he picked up at 3:00 and gave me a voice of reason. Talked to him for an hour. I appreciate you bro. Went home moved all of my stuff into the spare room, moved all of hers out into the bedroom. Same with the bathroom. Completely asleep. I wanted her to wake up. I had all of the lights on. Started cleaning the spare room, she finally wakes up 5:00. I tell her to put clothes on and go out to the living room. I don’t say anything. I just stare at her, I said if you want there to be any chance of us having. A future you’ll be completely honest with me. I ask her if there was anything else that she wanted to share with me. Was there anything else that happened and I understand that she’s been emotionally checked out. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Yes I’ve been checked out, but no, why are we talking at 5:00”

I’m not proud of this. But I literally interrogated people for three years in the military. It’s not something I use outside of business and negotiations. I tossed her phone open to the screenshot to her and asked her to explain. “So you’re mad at me for asking ChatGPT a question?” Red doesn’t even explain the colors I saw. I took a walk. I had to walk that one off. I read the message to her. I told her to tell me the story of exactly what happened. Lie, inconsistency, hole, tell, subtle sign, one after one after one after one. I would never manipulate someone because of how unfair it can be to someone not ready for it. I finally got to some truth eventually. I realized how aggressive I was being. I took a step back and recognized what I was doing. I said I will take a step back very calmly, told her I want to listen to her. It was complete emotional cheating. I don’t believe it went physical but the damage was already done. 

I think I would have been able to accept that she was weak and found a bit of what I was not giving her (two months before this) if she was just honest with me. Maybe if she apologized, told me how she was going to fix her action. Told me that she chose me and that’s why he was blocked and will show me anything that’s still left from their conversations. I know I’ll never have the whole truth. I had to explain to her that she hasn’t taken accountability for anything that’s she did. Something she’s constantly struggled with in our relationship. Even in these moments I’m still receiving all the blame for not giving her these things. I deserved to be left. I didn’t deserve to be cheated on. 

We took a break from the conversation. 9:00 now. I gave her another chance to explain to me. More lies, ones that didn’t even match up from before. I’ll never be able to trust you, I’ll never be able to feel comfortable in a time where we’re facing something hard because what if you aren’t getting what you needed. I told her I wish she just broke up with me like she said she may do on the 12th in a conversation with one of her friends. I wish the story of our ending wasn’t this. 

We discussed logistics. She moved out almost completely today. Ironically she moved in with a guy I have always told her that I don’t trust and that I don’t like her being one on one with him. Whatever, icing on top of deep hurt already. We’re separating the rest. Gym today, lease tomorrow, rest of her things this week. T-Mobile later this week. 

Felt numb most of yesterday. Rode the waves of emotion today. Anger, sadness, grief, joy, desire, hate, frustration, disassociation, lack of give a fuck. All of them over and over and over. Finally got some sleep last night, found a solid concoction of natural medication. The echo in the house after you empty a room is loud. Trying to focus on the positives. Setting time frames where I’m allowed to think about things. Trying to hold myself true to that but it’s hard. 


 Original post:
I 29M received a text from my girlfriend’s 26F coworker tonight about some things my girlfriend has been saying which is making quite a few people at work uncomfortable. “She’s made comments about multiple customers being very attractive, one of them making “sex eyes” at her and she said she wasn’t mad about it… and she told me that she had went to that new bar downtown with some girls and danced with a guy all night that she also found very attractive. It didn’t feel right keeping all this to myself and would want to know if I was in your position..” I’m pretty taken aback as it has to be pretty aggressive to make your coworkers this uncomfortable as the coworker and I don’t talk. This is at a coffee shop. This is pretty new behavior and hasn’t happened to this extent before.

We’ve been together for three years now, live together, discussing future. To be honest things have gotten pretty rough recently. The last three months have been hard, I’ve been pretty career focused and perhaps wasn’t giving as much attention to the relationship as I should. She brought this up to me and seemed to have one foot out. Things have gotten better, I’ve stepped up to all of the areas she said she needed, but it’s felt like a losing battle. Things have been better but it still feels pretty empty. I’ve had quite the gut feeling that something else has been going on for the past few months. I’ve never been able to confirm but this just kinda reinforces that feeling. This just kinda feels like a final blow where if this is what other people are seeing, what else is going on. I haven’t discussed this with her, I don’t want to bring in the message and cause drama in their workplace and mostly just want to keep the coworker anonymous. I feel like this relationship is a feeling of comfort for her at this point.

What are your alls thoughts? I do love her but damn am I not into wasting my time with someone with one foot out and behaving like this.

Update #1: to give everyone a bit more insight. This was her female coworker that messaged me, she’s recently engaged, we’ve never communicated outside of casual talk when I’m getting a coffee or at their work Christmas party. I’m friends with her fiancé and we went to the same school so there’s no ill intentions. This particular bar was a country swing bar that had just opened, it opened on a night that I was out of the country for work and it wasn’t a secret that she went. I’d have full expectation that she would go and dance casually, that’s not a boundary. What is a boundary is telling your coworker unprompted that you danced with this guy all night that you found attractive. We’ve been in what I thought was a better spot, working on the things that she needed from the relationship and this just comes like a gut punch. I don’t have the expectation we would go back to normal overnight, but I do have the expectation there would be effort and a bare respect while we are working on it or what’s the point.

It’s a bummer, but this is coming after a long list of things that I was willing to accept in our relationship from hobby differences to moral differences. But now that this has happened it’s kinda blowing all of that out of the water. I’m willing to grow and work on a relationship with someone. I’m not willing to be in a one sided relationship because I have things to work on and this is the result.

Update #2: I broke things off tonight. The more I festered on this the clearer everything became. I don’t believe she physically cheated on me, I truly don’t believe she has that in her capacity (yes I understand how ignorant that can sound). But the more I considered the things I was sacrificing in our relationship, not feeling understood, not having a partner that could be accountable for how her behavior and attitude affect others, ignorant hypocrisy and a lot of other things that I’ve been able to optimistically put aside for the last three years that after trust disappearing are no longer acceptable.

She was pretty much in shock. She wasn’t really able to accept I was serious about ending the relationship. I never once accused her of doing anything but I did tell her someone in her circle told me the above and that confirms a long standing gut feeling I’ve had. She became pretty defensive that she never did anything. I believe that to a point. The conversation started to get pretty emotional and I made an exit. She asked if there was any chance to work on this and if my mind was 100% set. I said right now there is no way we can work on this and I can’t be 100% set because I care about her a lot, but the fact that I have a lack of trust in our relationship and I see a lot of these other things very clear now overcomes the uncertain parts. I had to leave pretty quick after that.

A little context first: we’re both in our early 40s, we both have kids, and we each have them about 50% of the time (I have mine many days a week). On the nights when neither of us has our kids, our plan is basically to get together and have sex. We both come from corporate backgrounds, so I think she’s a very smart, professional woman. I’m well over a year out of a divorce, and she’s the first person I’ve been seeing because I’m horny — I’m not looking for a relationship, but I do want to find someone I can casually be with who won’t sleep with other people. She’s said she’s looking for the exact same thing.

I met this girl two weeks ago at a coffee shop. Things clicked quickly, and even though she went on a week-long vacation with her sisters right after, we kept in touch the whole time. We were texting and flirting a lot while she was away, and she was sending me photos from her trip.

While she was on vacation, I noticed she updated some of the text on her Hinge profile — nothing major, just small changes. When she got back, we made plans to hang out that Friday (about a week and a half after meeting). On that date, she told me she wanted us to be sexually exclusive — basically that she didn’t want either of us sleeping with other people.

A few days later, I went over to her place, and we ended up sleeping together for the first time. Everything felt good and natural. But then today, I noticed she updated her Hinge profile again — this time adding new photos from her Mexico trip.

That threw me a little. I’m not trying to overreact — it’s only been two weeks — but it feels odd to have someone talk about sexual exclusivity and still actively update their dating profile.

So tonight, I updated my own Hinge too, added a few new photos of me.

Now I’m wondering: am I wasting my time here? Or is it normal to keep a profile somewhat active early on, even after sleeping together and talking about sexual exclusivity?",1,1761624082.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

1ohzrhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontocraftbeer/comments/1ohzrhy/pumpkin_beer_review_12_ten_beer_reviews_at_once/,Pumpkin Beer Review #12: Ten beer reviews at once at Steadfast Brewing's Fall Cask Fest event,"I was tagged by the good folks at Steadfast for their barrel event, where they were going to crack open a bunch of barrels including several pumpkin beers, and so I went on Friday. Before I get to the beers, Steadfast Brewing is great and if you’re looking for a good, fun bar for beer lovers with a great vibe, this is it. The staff were friendly, most of their beers we tried were great (most…I’ll get to that in a bit), and the tacos by Miguel Angel Garcia were freaking awesome. We watched the Jays game, chatted with some of the other people there, played some board games and generally had a great time. Great beer, great dudes and great vibes. It’s not in my neighborhood, but I’ll go out of my way to go there again.

Also Miguel, if you’re reading this, that birria consume was incredible, and I will see you again soon! If you like tacos, seek this dude out. He’s at Steadfast several nights a week, but does pop up events elsewhere too. (And his taste in heavy metal music is outstanding.)

So Steadfast in general was awesome, and I really liked several of their beers. But what I didn’t like was the one of the taster flight line ups. Flight #1 had a couple of good things, and two interesting things to try even if they weren't my favourite. But flight #2 was just terrible across the board. There were two of us, and we didn’t finish three of the four things in the flight, and I saw lots of people doing the same. Having only one of the four beers be mediocre, and the other three be bad enough that lots of people didn’t finish them wasn’t a great look. It didn’t bring down the night, and I’ll still be back, but I’ll have a lot of questions about what’s in a flight if I consider ordering one here again.

Because we were doing flights, I ended up trying 10 things, so here is my rapid fire rankings of what we tried:

**Steadfast Brewery: Dog Days IPA: 8.5/10**

This is a West Coast IPA, and I’m usually more of a fan of East Coast IPAs, but I REALLY liked this. Like a lot. I love IPAs, and this is top tier. Great aroma, drinks really smoothly and I really enjoyed it a lot. If you like West Coast IPAs, this will probably be in your top five. Go try it, really.

**Steadfast Brewery: Their seasonal Oktoberfest lager, whatever it was called: 8.5/10**

I thought I wrote this down, but they had a seasonal German style lager on tap and it was excellent. Both me and my friend really enjoyed it. Very crisp and clean like a lager should be, but with some actual flavour and depth to it. Just the right amount of malty crisp bitterness to it, just excellent. If you guys read this and respond with the correct name, I’ll correct this, but great October lager guys!

***Taster Flight# 1:***

**Alving Brewery, “Alving Especial” Oatmeal Stout with Banana, Ancho chilis and Nutmeg: 6/10**

Neither me nor my friend liked the banana in this one, which gave it an off taste which was mild, but not my favourite. The ancho chili had more of a kick than I was expecting, and it was distracting. I like spicy stuff a lot, it wasn't that it was too intense, it was that it didn't blend well with the beer. I wish I’d tried this one last, because the spice really lingered which made it harder to really taste the other beers. We had some spicy food and came back to this, and liked it much more. If they do this again with a different beer (I’m just not a fan of oatmeal stouts) and either get rid of the banana altogether or substitute it for a different fruit, peach or pear maybe, and this could be amazing. It was good, I liked it, but as is with the banana and being an oatmeal stout, I’m glad I didn’t have a whole pint.

**Amsterdam Brewery, “Posh Spice” Downtown Brown: 8/10**

This is a good all round pumpkin spice beer where the spice flavour really came through, but was still balanced and balanced and complimented the beer. I really like like brown ales, but even given that, this is a really good brown ale, and moreover, the spices, while very prominent, were balanced, and added to the beer overall. No notes.

**Revel Cider Co., Black Currant Sidro Pub Cider: 4/10 for me, 6/10 for my friend**

This wasn’t bad, but I’m not a big black currant guy and was having a hard time deciding if I liked this or not. I’m also not a huge cider guy, so I think people should probably disregard my opinion on this one completely. My friend, who does like ciders and does like black currant, enjoyed this.

**Steadfast Brewing “Midsommar” Mulled Barleywine: 5.5/10**

Again, I’m not a big barleywine guy, and while I’m in general a fan of spice forward drinks, the mulling spices were a little too strong and not well balanced> That's in part because this stuff is 11.5%, so you can really taste the alcohol, which plays off the cinnamon, clove and other spices here, coming off quite intense. I was very aware of not being the target audience. A couple of people I spoke to said they liked it, but a few more agreed it needed work. I’m giving it a 5.5 because I could taste the quality and like the risks they took with the intensity of the mulling spices, and if you really like strong barleywines and intense spice flavours, you might like this. This is the only one in flight #1 that I didn't finish.

***Taster Flight# 2:***

**Rorschach Brewing, “Goodness” Peanut Butter Jelly Dry Stout: 1/10**

Why do people keep making peanut butter stouts?! This was just terrible. I like peanut butter sandwiches. I probably have one once a week for breakfast or lunch, and so when I say it it tasted like drinking a peanut butter sandwich, but not in a good way, I really mean it. Just ugh. Also, you couldn’t taste the beer at all. The beer did give it a bready flavour, so it really tasted like a liquified peanut butter sandwich. I didn’t finish my little taster flight glass, neither did my friend, because this just got worse after each sip. I saw several people at other tables didn’t finish this one either. If multiple people won’t finish three ounces of your beer, that they paid $5.5 for (flights of four were $22), you made a shitty beer. (Including this post, I've reviewed 21 beers in total this October, and this is the first 1/10. Stop making peanut butter stouts!)

**Steadfast Brewing Pumpkin Pie Vietnamese Coffee Porter: 3/10**

It’s pretty clear to me that I don’t like coffee porters, and the coffee flavour here is really strong in a way I didn’t like. Unfortunately, my friend agreed, and he likes coffee porters a lot. C’est What’s Coffee Porter used to be one of his all time favourites, but this one didn’t do much for him. This beer also helped me understand why so many brewers are shy about too much spice in their beers. Turns out you can definitely go off the rails and have the spice flavours throw off the beer completely. I feel bad writing this, but this just wasn’t good. Neither of us finished the taster glass.

**Godspeed Brewery, “Kofola” Czech Cola Dunkel with Anise, Cherry, Citrus: 3.5/10**

This was NOT for me. Too sweet, the anise was overpowering - you could smell it from three feet away - and mixed with the cherry, this tasted too much like cough syrup. I didn’t finish this one either, and neither did my friend. It wasn’t bad for what it was, but what it was isn’t for me at all. If you REALLY like anise and don’t mind an almost syrupy sweet dunkel, you might like this. We didn’t finish this one either.

**Babe Brew Oatmeal Brown Ale with Pumpkin Spice: 4/10**

The spice is actually noticeable here, not strong, but noticeable. Unfortunately, the beer itself is not great honestly, and there was this weird acidic note to it that felt weirdly out of place. It had this aftertaste that was not bad, but was…confusing, as if someone mixed in some fruit sour into it or something. Balance was missing, beer wasn’t great and the spices couldn’t save it. All in all, I’m going to skip this one in the future. This was the only one I finished in flight #2.",5,1761623999.0,torontocraftbeer,1,1.0,False

1ohzoqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ohzoqh/the_biggest_issue_i_have_with_caffeine_i_dont/,The biggest issue I have with caffeine. I don’t dream on it.,"The different levels of addiction, from high to low, I’ve experienced with caffeine are the following:

- French press coffee: This level is the craziest and most intense one for me. I get dry hair, lips, etc. my skin gets so dry that my knuckles bleed. Sleep quality is 0.
- Espresso machine: very intense like the French press coffee, but unless quantity.
Sleep is bad and stress is high 
- instant coffee: this one is not as intense but still does some damage to my sleep
- Black and green tea: this level is a little bit lower than instant coffee, although I get almost no stress from it.

But even at the lowest level there is one thing they all have in common:

I don’t dream when on any amount of caffeine.

If I go 3 or 4 days of no caffeine at all, I start to get these very vivid and lucid dreams.

Dreams are super important to me. They help me view my life and life problems from a different angle, like in the 3rd person. Sometimes in an artistic way.

I know it’s not a 1 to 1 comparison but whenever I hear someone why they have used ayahuasca and how it has helped them, I always think dreaming is something similar to me. 

Another thing that happens at any level is the lack of naps. Like I never get naps during the day on any amount.

# Breweries

Local breweries and their taprooms in **bold**. Emojis for food 🍕🥪🍔🪽🍟🥗 and Dog 🐕 (generally outdoor only) & very family friendly🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒. Realize all breweries are family-friendly, so these are just the ones that seem to go above and beyond or are more restaurant than brewery.

1. **Barrique Brewing & Blanding** (founded 2017, took over current space in 2021) is located downtown on the East Bank, a few blocks from Nissan Stadium. It was started by Joel Stickrod in a warehouse. When Little Harpeth was purchased by Lipman, Joel acquired their brewer Spencer Longhurst. In the beer geek circle, these two are considered to be the best brewers in Nashville. Styles: Known mostly for lagers and wild & mixed-ferm sours, including barrel aged lagers, they were able to expand their clean program a few years back when they acquired Little Harpeth's 20 barrel fermentation tanks. Barrique is one of a few that routinely does cask beer. No flagships to speak of; very experimental, but also heavy on traditional lagers you might not find in many breweries around the country. No food on site. 🐕
2. **Bassline** 🍕🥪🍔🪽🍟🥗(founded as Bold Patriot in 2019, rebranded in 2023): Bassline is located in the *L&L Market* on Charlotte in West Nashville. The original recipes are from *Bold Patriot Brewing*, which formerly occupied this space. The brewery is more of a taproom and live music venue these days. They do BOGO beer specials Tuesday - Friday. Beer styles are across the board, with no standouts. Cafe inside. 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
3. **Bearded Iris:** Shortly, this entry will become *Wiseacre*, as they purchased Bearded Iris summer 2025 and are converting the taprooms. Bearded Iris is known for Homestyle, the number one selling craft beer in Tennessee, and likely the main reason Wiseacre acquired Bearded Iris. Various styles, but not sure which will persist once Germantown is completely taken over by Wiseacre. They are renovating to add a kitchen. Normal brews on tap include Homestyle, Tunnel Vision, Wave Craze, Pink Flamingo, and Pep Talk lager. 🐕
4. **Black Abbey** (founded 2008): is located in South Nashville in the 100 Oaks area (Sidco Drive). They have been traditionally known for their Belgian style beers, but the brewery rebranded a bit, as the beer styles are more varied today. Minimal food on site but often have food trucks. Regular releases are Original Lager, Pub Ale, Tennessee IPA, Five Points IPA, The Rose (Blonde Belgian), and the Special (Belgian Dubbel). Another brewery that routinely has beer on cask. 🐕
5. **Blackstone** (founded in 1994, moved to North Nashville in 2001). Kent Taylor and his partner Stephanie Wines started this brewery in 1994 on West End. Kent was about the beer, Stephanie about the food. Stephanie passed in 2014 and the Brewpub was closed on West End and move to the brewery in 2016. Beers are more traditional, with the staples being Hopjack IPA, Atom Bomb Double IPA, Tropjack (a tropical version of hopjack), St Charles Porter, Nut Borwn Ale, and Chaser Kolsch. Their annual Black Belle (barrel aged in Belle Meade Bourbon casks) is a crowd favorite when unveiled each year on Black Friday. The building also serves as the taproom for **Nashville Beer Company** (see later). No food currently, but you are free to bring something in. Half price brews on Sunday.🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
6. **Broadcast Brewing** 🍔🍟(founded 2011, reopened in South Nashville in 2023): Broadcast is the brainchild of Mike Causy, who is often the only person working in the brewery. It is a small operation that would be easy to miss if you did not know where to look. Currently, he has 3 of his brews on tap, with guest taps to round out the list. Has a permanent food truck - *Austin's Burgers* \- in front for food. Current style list are a dark red, dark IPA, honey blonde ale, and a vanilla cream ale.🐕
7. **Crazy Gnome** 🍕🪽(founded 2020, current location 2025): Crazy Gnome is helmed by Grayson Miller, the main brewer. They were originally located in the back of the building housing Main Street Liquor but moved in  2025 to the north side of East Nashville, near the train tracks. Has full time food on board with P.U.B. Pizza, which is a permanent kitchen partner. Crazy Gnome has a variety of brews, both lagers and ales. Usually at least 1 sour, a couple of IPAs of different genres, a porter or other dark, and different colored ales (Brown, red, etc.). Grayson also owns **Cyanide Cider**.🐕
8. **East Nashville Beer Works** 🍕🥗🍟(opened in 2016): Founded by Anthony Davis, Tim Hellndrung, and Terry Carrico in 2016, this is now one of the most family-friendly breweries in Nashville. Beer usually a bit drier than other breweries and they have a full kitchen: pizza, sandwiches, and salads primarily. Core beers are East Bank Citra IPA, Miro Miel (honey blonde), Sipper (Golden Ale), and Sour SZN (fruited sour). 🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
   1. Second location opened in Lebanon in 2024. 🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
9. **Fait la Force** 🥪(Opened 2022): Founded by Parker Loudermilk and Zachary Sowada, they started out with Belgian and Belgian inspired beers. They currently brew a variety of beers, including Belgians, IPAs (hazy and west coast), lagers, and porters. Their hoppy lagers and Baltic porter are one of the best in easy of these styles. Currently have food from *Jambox Sandwiches* as a permanent popup in their kitchen. 🐕
10. **Fat Bottom** 🍕🥪🪽🥗🥨🌮🍟(Opened 2012 in East Nashville, moved to The Nations in 2017): Very nice space in the Nations and has a large room for hosting private events. Decent food menu.

Their core beers are Bear Walker Brown, Hazy IPA, Lovebird Wheat, Conquer and Prevail Pale, Fennario IPA, Thunder Ann Pale, Drinking Buddy Golden, Sarka Bohemian Pilsner, and Jackalope Light. They also brew Von Elrod's Neighborhood Pilsner for the Capitol North German restaurant (Von Elrod's). 
12. **Living Waters** (founded 2019): Originally known for their dark beers, Living Waters has come out swinging on IPAs and lagers of different types. When they run a Kolsch service, it is a lot of fun. THis brewery was founded by three people, Ryan McCay (brewer), Thomas Becker (musician) and Gentry Wiggington (coffee expert). It is the only brewery you can get a beer early in the morning, although most people will be ordering coffee at that time. 
   1. **East Nashville** 🌯(opened 2019): Minimal food from *Secret Bodega*. Sometimes have other options. 🐕
   2. **West Nashville** 🍔🍟(Nations - established 2025): Partnered with *Bad Luck Burger* as a permanent kitchen popup. 🐕
13. **Marble Fox** (opened in 2023): Came out swinging and have only improved since then. It was founded by John A. Eibl Sr, John A. Eibl Jr, and Andrew Brophy. The concept dates back to the late 1800s, when John Sr's great-grandfather, Johann Baptist Eibl, a German immigrant, ran Fox Head Brewing company in Milwaukee, until he sold it in 1921. 🐕
14. Monday Night (Atlanta Brewery - opened in Germantown in 2021): One of the neatest brewery space in Nashville, this is part of the former Neuhoff factory building. The outside space is in a shored up section of the factory that collapsed. Monday Night is HQed in Atlanta and has a Birmingham location, as well. Both of the other locations brew onsite; the Nashville location does not. Specials include Token Tuesday, where you get a token for a free beer for every beer you buy. Limited snack items on the menu. Beer is across the board, including IPAs (clear and hazy), sours, darks, barrel aged beers, and a variety of lager styles. 🐕
15. **Nashville Brewing Company** (Original opened in 1859, Scott Mertie resurrected in 2016 - located in *Blackstone*.): Scott Mertie found old Nashville Brewing Company recipes and worked with Kent Taylor of Blackstone to scale and tailor them to modern equipment. The beer is served in the Blackstone taproom, which has half off beers on Sunday. 🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
16. **New Heights** 🍕(Established 2016): Located in South Nashville near the cemetery, New Heights is the creation of Jeff and Tracey Fountain. Jeff is the head brewer. This location has 312 Pizza at all times, along with a few other snacks. Food trucks regularly, especially on busy nights like trivia night.  As they have a large open lot next door, they often will have music and craft events on site. 
17. **Smith & Lentz** 🍕🍝🥗(): 
18. **Southern Grist** (Opened on Porter Road in 2016 - currently Schulman's): Recently acquired by *Xul* and taprooms switched over by the end of 2025. At this point, *Xul* will take over by the end of 2021. The Batch One series will continue to be produced along with good sellers in distribution. 
   1. **West Nashville** (Nations): Opened in 2018. This location has the main brewery, as well as a taproom. Many of their yearly events are held at this taproom. Food available, but very limited, except on weekends. 🐕
   2. **East Nashville 🍕**🥪🍟🥗(Douglas): Opened in 2021 in a building they own on Douglas Road. Their restaurant La*uter* is an upscale-ish restaurant, although the menu is limited now. 
19. **Stokehaus** (founded 2025): Founded by Chad Mueller and Mike Morbitzer, who both had a past with *TennFold*. They are in the back of the building that houses Main Street Liquors in East Nashville, former home of *Crazy Gnome*. In addition to beer, they are known for their BBQ, which is a permanent food truck in front of the restaurants and a pit behind the fence. A bit too early to figure what their flagships are, but the beer will most likely be on the same keel as TennFold. 
20. **Tailgate** 🍕🥪🪽🍟🥗(Originated in 2007 in San Diego, Moved to Tennessee in 2014): Tennessee's fastest growing brewery, Tailgate has 9 taprooms, 7 of which are in Davidson County (Nashville). 1 location (airport - BNA) is a franchise.

   7. Hendersonville 🍕🥪🪽🍟🥗(2023): This was set to be their lagering brewery location. Sits across from the marina and has ample outdoor space. 🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
   8. **South** 🍕🥪🪽🍟🥗(Tanger Outlets - 2023): Not originally what Wes would have done, as it is an outlet mall, but Tanger wanted some local restaurants and businesses, so he agreed to sign on. 🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒

Their core beers are Hippie's and Cowboys IPA (clean and hazy versions), 1927 IPA, Urban Hiker Lager, State Park Blonde, Southern Wit, and Extra Easy Amber. They also brew seasonal beers, like Gazelle Hazy IPA, a collab with Turner Haus Brewing in honor of Wilam Rudolph or Queen's Legacy with the same, honoring Victoria Edley Butler, the great grandchild of Nearest Green (Uncle Nearest bourbon barrel aged Caribbean-style stout). 🐕
22. **TennFold** 🍕🥪🪽🥗(2020 - Downtown: Pie Town): Was opened by chef Edgar Pendely (co-owner of Urban Grub in 12 South) with restauranteur Hunter Hankansan, from Nectar fame. Carl Mueller, now of *Stokehaus*, brewed for *TennFold* until 2025. Current brewer is *Sean Cassidy*, who brewed with *Bearded Iris*, before the buyout from *Wiseacre*. TennFold, like East Nashville Beer Works, tends to brew a bit drier. Core beers are Business Hippie West Coast IPA, Flat Pedal Golden Ale, Irma Gersch German Style Pils, Feast With Friends American Style Lageer, and Groovy Shade IPA. 🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
23. **Yazoo** 🍔🍟 (Opened 2003 in Marathon Village, moved to the Gulch in 2010, then to Madison in 2019):  One of my first experiences in the local brew scene was joining a friend to help Yazoo bottle beer. We were paid in beer, of course. *Yazoo* was part of our brewery row, others of which include *Jackalope* (around the corner), *Tennessee Brew Works* (only one still in original location), and *Czann's* (now defunct). Yazoo was founded by Linus and Lila Hall. Brandon Jones is responsible for their funk beers (Head Funkmaster. They have Grillshack Burgers as their permanent food popup. 🐕🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒
24. Yee-Haw (2019 - Downtown: SoBro): This brewery combined with *Ole Smokey Moonshine*. While the HQ is out of Nashville, unlike *Monday Night*, they brew in their location. Downtown, it attracts a large amount of visitors. The brewery was started in Johnson City, TN in 2015. They have locations in  Knoxville, and Greenville, SC, as well. 

# Cideries

1. **Diskin's Cider** (opened 2018)**-** last day was Sunday, October 26, 2025 at their OG location. They have stated plans to reopen in the future, but have not outlined a location. Started by Adam Diskin and Todd Evans, the cidery specializes more in sweeter ciders. My favorite of the bunch is BTC (Bourbon Tart Cherry), which is seasonal, but has been seen regularly in recent years. Others include Bob's Your Uncle, Lil' Blondie, Tiki Tonik, and Babe Magnet.  
2. **Cyanide Cider** (founded 2025) - Another creation of Grayson Miller, *Crazy Gnome*. Where Diskin's is more about sweet cider, Cyanide focuses on drier ciders. Grayson has also created various mixes to create cider cocktails and won the Common John Brewery of the year award for his apple pie sour. They have food on site. 

# Meadery

1. **Honeytree** 🍔🍟 (founded in 2019): This meadery does a variety of traditional and experimental meads. They harvest their own honey, so the mead supports local beekeepers. There is a *Bad Luck Burger* food truck on the premises for food.

1ohzmbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ohzmbw/i_26m_think_its_time_to_break_up_with_my_partner/,I (26M) think it's time to break up with my partner (27F) who lives in a different city. What are the best practices in this situation?,"So some context...

I'm 26M and I met my current partner (27F) online on Hinge. We started going on dates in May 2025 and have seen each other roughly 1x a week from then until now. We live in two different cities about an hour apart and we're both very busy people so 1x a week, usually on a weekend day, is typically the only time we get to see each other.

Starting after about date 6 (late July/early August timeframe), the relationship became more physical and we started spending nights together. So now it's the norm that when we get together for an evening, we stay together that night and then someone leaves to go home the next morning after coffee.

At the beginning of the relationship in May, June, and July, I was so motivated to win her affection and get her to commit to a relationship (I would have loved to label it) but she was clear about wanting more time and to have a slow burn. So, I continued to go at the pace we were going at and not add any pressure. Now in the last month or so, it is like a switch has flipped and she is now very invested in me and is the one pushing for labels and commitment (she fishes for information like what I call her to my friends, asks to meet my friends, tells me that she's telling her friends about me, tells me all about all the ideas she has for things we are doing together anywhere from months to years from now, etc.). This shift has really stressed me out because I'm realizing that I don't actually feel emotionally invested in this relationship and don't feel like it's going to be a long-term fit for me.

For some reason, being around her, I don't feel like I can be totally honest about myself, my interests, and my thoughts. I also think she's too loud and often times too mean when she talks about other people. I'm also just plain not attracted to her physically. I kind of get this hot nervous feeling when she texts and I get stressed planning to see her and am relieved when I am done spending time with her. All of these feel like very obvious indicators it's time to break up. I don't want to waste any more of her time or mine or make it harder than it needs to be so it's time to rip off this band-aid.

Now, here are the two tricky parts:

1. As I mentioned above, at the beginning of the relationship, I was pretty motivated to get her onboard with me as a person. So from her point of view she probably things I'm super into her. And because we live an hour apart and only text 1x a day (never call, never FaceTime, etc.) and we text about really surface level stuff, she has literally no idea that I'm not really into this relationship unless she can detect it while we're together.
2. We live an hour away so I don't know when and where to initiate this breakup conversation. From the reading I've done, I've come to learn it's bad form to break up over text (this one feels obvious). I'm not going to call her b/c we've never called so that would be so odd. And I've read that it's not okay to plan a date, go to her place, then break up with her. I've also read it needs to be on her turf, so it does need to be at her place. But this creates a paradox because I don't know how to get to her place without setting up a date.

So here's my ultimate question - what's the best form here for committing this breakup? Do I text her and just say ""we need to talk at your place"" without any other plans, go there, and have the talk?  Do I plan a date starting at hers and blindside her? Is this the kind of situation in which a text is the better form as to not set up a ""date"" just to stage an in-person conversation? Oh, sweet patrons of the internet, please share your ideas here based on your lived experience as to better guide me to end this.",2,1761623524.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Anyone have any insight on roasting green decaf beans? Or why the decaf coffee tastes either bitter, sour, burnt, or watery?

As it was my first relationship with a woman, and as a mother, I didn't manage things as well as I could and struggled with juggling everything and everyones emotions. My partner wanted to be all in and involved in parenting and I found this challenging and didn't clearly define her role from the beginning. I ended the relationship after 8 months as I felt I couldn't give her the time she deserved. This was a few months ago and she has reached out and we are having coffee tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it but conflicted as I have regrets about ending things. I have reflected that I found the dynamic of a queer relationship so different from hetero that I often felt overwhelmed. I suppose what I am asking is if others mucked up their first queer relationship and how they recovered, either in the relationship or apart.

Like getting coffee, or going to a restaurant, seeing a movie, etc etc. It's all just wasteful garbage though. You almost never have real conversations sitting across from each other at a restaurant. Even with your family and friends, you're typically just chatting while you're sitting around the table at Golden Corral on Thanksgiving. The real conversations happen when you're chilling on the couch together at home. 

So, if I try to ask that we hang out at your place or mine for a first date and just watch something, it's not because I'm too lazy to go out, or too cheap to pay for dinner, or because I'm just trying to get laid. When I say I wanna Netflix and chill, I actually want to watch Netflix and chill. I'm too old to waste time dressing up to sit awkwardly at Chili's and make polite chit-chat. Let's just order a pizza, rewatch the MIB trilogy, and cut through the bullshit so we can actually get to know each other.

Knowing this usually isn't the socially acceptable way to do things is a significant part of why I haven't asked anyone out in 4 years. 

P.S. For the record, 3 out of 5 times when I have gotten a date to just come over to watch something, I'm watching the movie, but about 30 minutes in I notice she or he is watching me and has no interest in the movie. At which point, it doesn't really feel like just continuing to watch the movie is an option. ",0,1761622831.0,unpopularopinion,39,0.3,False

1ohz4zs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohz4zs,"My friend died in 2018, and I still miss her so very much.","I met my friend Norma when I was 9. She was 23 at the time and moved into the apartment complex where my Mema was living. She and Mema became fast friends. She inspired me to study Spanish, and I hold two degrees in the language. My love of the culture and language happened entirely because of her. 

I knew my friend as Maria back then (I’ll explain in a bit). She was originally from Mexico, and when she was 14, she and one of her brothers came to Texas. She moved to California within a couple years, and she still spoke very little English at the time. She worked in a restaurant, and a guy started coming to sit at her table nearly every shift. They ended up getting married. He is an engineer of some sort, and his job brought them to central Georgia, to the same small apartment complex where my grandmother had been living for 5 years or so. 

I loved Maria. I loved listening to her speak in Spanish when she was on the phone. And I loved her sweet voice and her adorable accent. She taught me a little bit of Spanish. But mostly I just listened to her. She gave birth to her son Joe when I was 9 or 10. I met him that same day because she had a planned home birth with a midwife. “Don’t ever have a baby, Heather, it hurts too much.” Those words stuck with me! Later, she explained it was not the birthing process but what came after that caused her to say that. She’d had to go to the hospital because the placenta hadn’t come out and having it removed while a lifesaving measure, is extraordinarily painful. This I now know from experience - I had an unplanned home birth in 2023 (gave birth while awaiting ambulance). It took 40 minutes to reach the hospital (and my baby was born about 15 minutes before the ambulance arrived); I remember the doctor in the ER being upset with the paramedics because they hadn’t started an IV and hadn’t given me pitocin while en route…I’d delivered the placenta but was hemorrhaging and had blood clots that needed to come out. So without anesthesia whatsoever, I endured the same torturous but necessary treatment my friend had gone through all those years before. I say I thought I knew what pain was up until that moment. I emitted sounds I didn’t even know I was capable of producing. 

Anyway, back to my friend. We lost touch when I was 12. Two weeks after my birthday, my Mema passed away, and I only saw Maria a few times after that. One of those was Easter. She and her husband and their son came to our house out in the country. She was heavily pregnant with their second son. Before he was born, they moved to a town about 30 minutes away. But it might as well have been 3 hours away; we never did go visit them. My parents preferred to stay home. I thought of Maria a lot after they moved, and I missed her. 

When I was 18 and soon to graduate high school, I had a dream one night. A prophetic dream, it turned out. 

In the dream, Maria came to my graduation. She drove the same Jeep she’d driven when I met her, and she had three little boys with her. In the decades that have passed since that dream, I’ve forgotten most of the details, but I do remember parts of it. 

Upon waking up, I wrote Maria a letter. I don’t even know why I’d never written her before that point in time. I could have had a relationship with her long before we reconnected, but hindsight is always 20/20. 

I sent the letter to the address I had for her from when they’d moved when I was twelve. Within a week or two, the phone rang and it was Maria! Only, that wasn’t her name, not the name she went by. 

By some miracle, though they’d moved two years before, my letter was forwarded to her new Florida address. She called the day she got the letter. It was so great to hear the sweet, gentle sound of her voice! 

The first thing she told me was that her name was Norma. My grandmother when they met and she introduced herself, had told her that she surely had another name by which she could be called; “Norma is a bad name,” she’d told her. “I told her, ‘you can call me Maria, it’s my first name, but my sisters and I are all Maria’s’,” she told me. I asked her if she knew why her name had evoked the reaction it did from my Mema, and since she didn’t, I explained to her that my dad is my grandmother’s only child. He had a marriage before he and my mom got married, and he and his wife had a son. When that child was 11, his mom had informed my dad she didn’t love him anymore and had left. She remained in the same city in Florida but didn’t even bother to do so much as call my half brother or even send him a single card. Her name? You guessed it, if your guess was Norma. 

Even though she now lived some 6 hours away, my precious friend traveled the distance to attend my graduation. And just like in my dream, she drove that same Jeep and had three little boys with her. One of them was her nephew. She had some relatives still living in the area, and I spent a lot of the week she was in town, there with her and the family she was staying with while she was in town. 

I travelled to Florida to spend just over a week with her over that summer, and we had such a great time. 

We kept in touch after that via phone and Facebook. But I got really sick in 2008 (I met her in 1992 for context) and remained ill for five years. During that time, I got married and had my daughter. Then I had to have surgery which had a pretty rough recovery that took over a year. Then my husband got cancer and fought for a year and a half, undergoing a major life-threatening surgery with an anticipated recovery time of a year. He had to have chemo and radiation after that bc the cancer spread during the operation. He didn’t survive; he passed away in August of 2017 when our daughter was just 4. I ended up losing my house after that and my life really spiraled out of control beyond any horrors I’d have ever imagined when I was younger. I faced challenges and battles I never dreamed I’d face (in part because I’d vowed not to have certain challenges…and I’ll just say it but please don’t judge me too harshly; I’m talking about addiction. I’m relieved and happy to say I am sober now, and I give the thanks for that to God). 

Prioritizing staying in contact with Norma just wasn’t even on my radar during those years, I’m sad to say. We lost touch around the time she moved to Texas. 

But our friendship had survived periods of no contact at all in the past. Most notably, the six year interim between her moving away and me writing her the letter after my dream. 

In early 2019, I decided it was time to reconnect. It was hard for me to believe it had been another six years since we’d last talked, save a Facebook comment here and there. But when I typed her name, I got nothing. “She blocked me or deleted her whole account,” I thought. I didn’t think she’d block me, but I didn’t think she’d delete her account either. So I looked up her sister, who I knew hadn’t really liked me at all whatsoever. But I reached out anyway, asking her to pass my message along to Norma. 

After I did that, I figured I would do some googling. And when I did, the result shocked me. I found Norma’s obituary. She’d been 49 at the time of her death. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I then found another relative’s Facebook profile, and I scrolled down through her history of posts… and the obituary had been shared in October of 2018. When my friend had died.

I realized I’d received a reply from the sister to whom I’d sent the message. She simply asked for my phone number. That message solidified that what was happening was real, that it was true Norma was gone. I told her I knew the news she was going to share, that I’d found the obituary. 

Her sister told me Norma had always loved me. And that she had not, and that it was a jealousy thing. And a lack of comprehending why her sister would rather “spend all her time dragging along some little gringa.” She shared that she and Norma had grown close several years before her passing, and I’m so grateful for that. She also apologized for having felt the way she did towards me and said she was glad her sister had had me as her friend. 

Norma was one of the healthiest people I had ever known, and her lifestyle was so supremely healthy, too. She walked all the time, and she ate very little processed food. She drank hot tea instead of coffee, and her diet consisted of a lot of fresh produce and meats, and a good bit of eggs, grains, etc. Very little sweets, and she used Splenda instead of sugar, I think exclusively. 

But cancer claimed her anyway. She had a general mistrust of western medicine due to a late-term pregnancy loss she’d suffered in California shortly before moving to Georgia; she’d been pregnant with a little girl and at full term, experienced bleeding. Three ER visits later, there was no heartbeat. But she’d been dismissed the two times before (all visits within 24 hours - she knew something was not right yet the doctors ignored her and her baby might otherwise have not died. So I get the mistrust and also understand why she opted for home births with her sons). 

By the time her symptoms became problematic enough for her to seek medical attention, the cancer had invaded not only her stomach, but her spine and her lungs as well. She did opt for aggressive treatment. And for the last nine months of her life, she battled the cancer, undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy, making her feel far more sick than she’d been from the cancer alone. 

She’d been dead for six months before I even knew anything; I hadn’t even known she was sick. And I’m sure she could’ve used my support and encouragement, but I’m so glad her family was there (her relatives in GA traveled to Texas several times to visit her as did her sister living in Alabama). I just regret so much that I was so consumed by my own struggles that I all but forgot about her. Well I never forgot her…I took for granted that she might not be there one day. I took for granted the fragility of life. 

If anyone could pick up on anything Norma would say, please do share. And even more, please tell her I’m so sorry that I didn’t reach out at all for so long, that it wasn’t an indication of how much I cared about her. I loved her so much and I always think about and remember her.

Earlier today a very, very attractive, fit, young, semi-tall Asian man was passing me at an intersection at Union Square and looked right at me and said, “You’re beautiful.” Usually when this happens in NYC (a) it doesn’t usually happen and (b) when it does I look at the person and there is something clearly off about them - ie a strong smell, unwashed clothes, manic / out of it vibe, very old man, etc. 

So immediately I just tried to get around him, but then it hit me that he had a nice face - a face and outfit I wouldn’t normally associate with a scammer as he seemed attractive and clean cut and had good taste, his energy wasn’t desperate or showy. But the fact that I liked his face hit me as I passed him, and so I turned around and looked back and so did he. And then he said, “Would you want to go for coffee?” I’m married, and I felt I needed to keep my wits about me anyways because it might be a con- like he distracts me while I get pickpocketed or something. Im pretty, but not like stop-you-in-your-tracks pretty, it’s NYC and I don’t stand out in a Union Square crowd and this man was objectively attractive. 

I say this because if I was single, I might have considered it. But as I’m married I immediately said no and kept walking, and took the compliment, and later made sure I still had my wallet.

But I keep thinking about it because something like that has either never happened to me or not happened in like a decade. For someone other than my husband to tell me I’m beautiful and stop me and ask me out to coffee - especially someone who seemed out of my league, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was a mark. That he scanned the crowd for someone who might say yes to him. And who picks people up in Union Square? I almost got the impression that he was hanging out doing that to people. My spidey senses were tingling.

Am I too skeptical from living in NYC for so long & do you think this was a genuine attempt at a meet-cute, or do you totally agree that this was probably a scam? Curious if anyone has had similar experiences. ",5,1761621822.0,AskNYC,54,0.54,False

1ohz1iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HangDogCityLimits/comments/1ohz1iv/hangdog_city_radio_13/,HangDog City Radio 1.3,"May gets into one of the elevators that requires her to actually manually input her ID number. The real point behind that is to make sure anybody trying to get into one has to stand still long enough for their identity to be visually confirmed. This one only goes to a singe place, there aren’t any buttons.



It opens and closes silently, the lights inside begin to dim as it starts to travel. May can feel it shifting slightly as it changes directions, and suddenly makes a connection. It’s meant to give the impression that it’s moving in specific physical directions, enough so you can kind of judge where you are in the station. But, and May knows this because she was here when it was constructed, it passes through an area where there isn’t “gravity” on the station, and at that point it actually re-orients and then the station gravity doesn’t seem to actually have an effect. The “gravity” here is all some Marasat trick, anyway, a practical application of the technology they’d used to make the stage. It’s not really surprising they’d be using it here, it had just become so normalized it took May until now to actually think about it. 



It comes to a stop, and one of the sides opens. This area is clearly organic, like tunnels made of dark roots, everything is covered in a glowing biofilm. May knows where she’s going, she sees a few Marasats but they ignore her. 



There’s another door, this one looks like an actual door, made of wood, with a brass knob. She doesn’t have to put her ID in, but it does make her shake the knob a bit to get it open. May always expects there to be a room like one that would go with the door, but this is a control deck. Display screens wrap around, giving a complete view of the exterior, there are some consoles and seats but those are hardly ever occupied. The only one that’s usually in here is now, a white bird-like creature, around the size of a pelican. It’s currently perched on the back on a small couch, watching ‘The Carol Burnette Show’ on a CRT TV. That bird-thing is the control system for Falcron, it’s what talks back when you talk to a console. 



May sits down on the couch and twists around to look at the not-a-bird. It has four eyes and sparse feathers, the bare skin covered in pebbly scales. It has the awkward build of a young chicken, past the cute stage but not quite into the fluffy adult.



“What do you want?” May speaks in English, but uses the extremely archaic version they’re speaking on the TV. 



Computer turns and considers her for several seconds, looks back at the screen. “You like this show?” 



“Sure. It’s fine.” May says. “Where did you get the plans for the haunted house on 9?”



“Nowhere in particular.” Computer says. 



“And where’s that?” May asks. 



“It’s just a house, it’s not that deep” Computer doesn’t look away from the screen. 



“Did you get it from ISTC records?” May presses and gets a head shake in response. “You had to have seen it somewhere.Where?” 



Computer turns abruptly to look at her. “You should visit your sister.”

 

May knows that tone, this is as much of an answer as she’s going to get on the subject, at least for now. These creatures are highly intelligent, and they have the ability to communicate but often are unable to do so in a way that makes sense if you look at it directly. Most of the people up here can’t speak to it directly this way at all, literally face to face. They interact through the consoles, where the output can be interpreted by the Marasats if needed. Though, of course, they can only tell you what it says, if it refuses to elaborate there’s not much you can do and they’ll eventually just get confused. 



The other crew here on Falcron know that May casually  goes down into the Marasat hive, and that she can talk to the control system directly. The general assumption is that it’s an effect of the translation device she has, and May makes no effort to correct them. While it’s true that the device does allow her to hear the Marasat chatter, and understand more of it, she could talk to these things before. It’s why she was offered a position at ISTC to begin with, one of them had spoken to her and she’d taken what she felt was appropriate action. ISTC ultimately agreed with her, just not the method she chose. 



JJ lives down on the surface, in an ISTC outpost that surrounds one of the main openings into the Marasat’s system of caves and tunnels. It’s supposed to be the place that the Rycacians crawled out of the ground, though since the flora there doesn’t fossilize there’s really no way to tell what happened after the Marasats arrived. This clearly isn’t the first place they colonized and then had a subspecies evolve, ISTC was familiar with them way before Rycacia. It is, in essence, just another colony planet, but this effort has been going on for so long that the species involved is operating on instinct. 



As far as ISTC is aware, they don’t go around destroying native life forms and taking over worlds. Maybe at one point they did, who knows, but they seem to prefer finding an actual barren rock, or somewhere that’s just flat out not hospitable period. Less competition, probably, they can make their own atmosphere and don’t generally bother with trying to live on the surface, which makes things much easier. 



They’d been happy to attempt to share their technology, but it isn't something that can have a widespread application. There’s really not a way to do anything with it without also creating and maintaining a Marasat hive, and things just don’t work the way inside of them that they are supposed to, or at least the way you’d expect. They toned it down here as much as they could, the size of the place and amount of actual synthetic and human material helps, but when you apply it to something the size of a normal starship it gets way too freaky. They just do what they want, you have to hope the ship feels like doing what you tell it on any given day. They’ll get scared and run away, seem to have some personal gripe and take you on a nonsensical ride for apparently no reason, and simply refuse to participate if they think the activity is ‘stupid’, and the way they communicate is generally indirect and takes a good deal of legwork to actually understand. 



Computer knows where JJ lives, telling May to visit is as good as saying the house is, or was, there. It’s a small town, if this place is still there, it shouldn’t be hard to find. 



“Do you like Factory Deal?” May asks. 



Computer nods. “They’re very entertaining.”



“Is there some reason you keep bringing them up?” May asks. 



Computer looks at her and arches an eye ridge. “I don’t.”



“Then why do I keep seeing their stuff everywhere all of a sudden?” May asks. 



“Confirmation bias?” Computer shrugs. 



“Uh huh, what about the birds?” May rolls her eyes. 



“I don’t know their minds.” Computer says. “You’re the one who keeps asking for videos, though, don’tcha know.”



“There’s something different about him.” May says. “Not, like, now and then, like him and the rest of the Rycacians. Do you know what I’m talking about?” 



“He can hear us.” Computer says. “In general, not, like, this conversation right now. You can see it in them, if you know what to look for.”



“His kid can, too, can’t she.” May says. 



“Oh, yes, she talks to us all the time.” Computer says. “She has very strong opinions on cinematography.”



“Does Adam talk to you?” May asks. 



“He’s very polite.” Computer says. 



May laughs. “He’s not, like, doing anything weird, is he?” 



“He’s very weird.” Computer says. “A social outcast, one might say, engaged in a particularly bizarre subset of niche culture that-”



“I mean criminal stuff, not pretending to be Axle Rose or whatever.” May rolls her eyes.



“Don’t you guys keep up with that?” Computer asks. 



“I’m just asking if you’ve seen him doing anything shady.” May says. 



“Nothing you haven’t seen him do before, I’m sure.” Computer says. 



May was already running under the assumption that he probably had banned substances and some of the equipment was likely made of material that was technically illegal in ISTC controlled areas. The only time anyone actually gets in trouble for shit like that here is if they’re moving large amounts or selling/ distributing it to a wider population. He obviously doesn’t get wasted and start fights or something, that definitely would be in the records. 



“Was I here when his kid was in the hospital?” May asks. 



Computer blinks at her, first one set of eyes, then the other. “No. You were away. You would have come back…two days after they left.”



“Ships passing in the night.” May says. “Not like it would have mattered, anyway.” 



“You can just call him, you know.” Computer says. 



“Ok, I’m sure it hasn’t been that long for you, but that was, like, half my life ago now and I haven’t talked to him. I can’t just pop up out of nowhere, that’s weird.” May says. 



“You can go see a show, you know. You can even pay for it, buy some merch, support your favorite local band…” Computer points out. 



“And deal with Rahal hassling me for the rest of my life? No thanks.” May says. 



“Letting other people dictate our actions now, are we?” Computer asks. “You like her quite a bit, don’t you.”



“She’s not a jackass.” May says. “She doesn’t know anything yet, but she’s got the spirit.”



“Neil hates her.” Computer says. 



“Good.” May says. “That means she’s doing her job properly.”



“Perhaps that’s why she’s been sniffing around you so much lately.” Computer says. “She has a nose for trouble.”



“You’d think she’d be used to that by now.” May says. 



“Maybe this time, it smells different.” Computer says. 



“Really, like what.” May asks somewhat sarcastically. 



Computer looks back at the screen, where a group of bears are dancing and singing about putting out campfires correctly. “You smell like World War II.”



May stares at Computer for a very long time. Things like this right here are why the translators can’t handle the language, so much of it is contextual. May understands this reference, though. She gets a sudden flash of real memory, not one of this translators attempts to explain subtlety. Hot metal, gunpowder, black smoke and burning oil, an air raid siren wailing endlessly somehwere you can’t see, hiding here in the dark. She blinks several times and shakes her head. 



“So, like the canteen coffee, then.” May says. 



Computer chuckles. “I’ve heard it’s quite bad. I can’t grow a coffee plantation here, sorry, the providence of those beans falls securely under ISTC control.”



May’s radio gives her a warning beep, then there is a stationwide notice that a parade is about to happen and anybody who wants to attend should get over there. May knows if she doesn’t show up, Neil will be in her ear asking what’s so important, and she’s pretty sure Computer has given her everything it intends to for now, anyway. 

  
  


“Hey, Baby-D?” Dusty says in a very sweet tone of voice. 



Diesel looks over at him suspiciously. “What do you want?”



“Can you pull the records on that cop that interviewed me?” Dusty asks. 



Diesel smirks. “Do you liiiike her?”



“I just want to see them” Dusty says. 



“Why?” Diesel asks. 



“I feed you, I clothe you, and this is the thanks I get.” Dusty throws his arms up in the air. 



“Fine, fine, gimmie a second.” Diesel rolls her eyes. “The drone’s can’t magically get up there, you know.”



Dusty gets most of the way through Hotel California, doing the guitar parts acapella, before the drone finally gets back and Diesel waves him silent. The file is the same one Dusty had gotten from the civilian console, but with an updated image. 



“Oh, come on, you couldn't sweet talk anything else out of them?” Diesel complains.



The display ripples, morphs, the screen is suddenly populated. He can see when she was enlisted into ISTC, a few years of bouncing around between planets and ships until she ended up on Rycacia, then has apparently been sitting on the station ever since. Except, there are periods on these ones that are inaccessible as well, and apparently that’s beyond the scope of the droné’s manipulation tactics. There is a pattern here, though, there seem to generally be rank or status changes upward following the redacted periods. 



“Woah, what does she do?” Diesel asks. 



“I think she’s a special agent for ISTC, but I’m not sure.” Dusty says. 



“Why’d she be way out here, then?” Diesel asks. 



“She can talk to the Marasats, understand them. More than that, I don’t think she realized it because…I think some humans are just like that. She can make things happen the way the Marasats can, sometimes.” Dusty shakes his head. 



“Like, Firestarter?” Diesel asks. 



“I think so, yeah.” Dusty says. “She told me one time that a lot of that stuff is real, just not as dramatic as they make it in the movies.”



“But they don’t use, like, flora, do they?” Diesel asks. “How could they do stuff like that?”



Dusty shrugs. “They just do. I think that other humans can tell, though, and don’t like it. They pack up, you know, but the only human I ever saw her actually, like, talking to, you know, up close, was her boss.”



“Sounds lonely.” Diesel says. 



Dusty shakes his head. “Maybe, I dunno, she seemed happy to just hang with us. Not, just, us, like the band, in general. She’d just flip, full three sixty, she is…super friendly. They can do that, you know, just decide to be something else and you just…stop noticing what they really are.”



Diesel has seen lots of humans, most of them on old broadcasts but there are a bunch on the station and some down on the surface. She’s never actually had the opportunity to really talk to one for an extended period before. She knows her dad had been involved with a human for awhile, it’s one of those band lore things that comes up all the time, but he’d never really talked about her beyond the occasional reference in a song or one off comment at a show. 



“Did you ever see her do something, like, violent?” Diesel asks. 



“She kicked down a door one time.” Dusty says. “The one to her place, when she couldn’t find the key. Just, like, stepped back and bang, busted the latch right off.”



“Shit.” Diesel says. 



“Yeah, like, they’re kinda small and it’s like, you want to be careful cause you think you’ll hurt them if you touch them too hard but…” He shakes his head. “She could have killed me, all of us, with her bare hands, and she knew it. She said we were lucky there isn’t anything here humans really want, or we’d be dead already.”



“Gross.” Diesel says. 



Dusty shrugs. “They’re a dangerous species. The ones around here have been hand picked, only certain ones get sent down here or to the station. They have all sorts of regulations and stuff designed to control who can go where, who can leave the place they were born even, because there really are lots of them that are…very aggressive. They’ll go somewhere and wipe out whatever is there, take it over. I think they have to be trained *not* to just kill anything that gets close enough, or if they don’t know what it is.”



“Dude.” Diesel says. 



“And they’re really hard to kill. The movies and stuff always show them getting shot or stabbed or hit and fall down dead, but it’s not like that at all. There are only a few places you can get a human and have them drop like that, they can and will just keep going until all the blood runs out of them.” Dusty says. 



“There’s another kind, though, the ones that get sent here. I don’t think those need to be trained not to hurt stuff, they just don’t really mind doing it if there’s a good reason.” Dusty says. “Those ones, they see something new and they want to be friends with it.”



“Friends?” Diesel laughs. 



“Yeah, they’ll actually put lots of effort, days, weeks, into getting some critter to get close enough so they can touch it and then it…changes.” Dusty shakes his head. “She said it would ‘become a people’ whatever.”



“Wait-” Diesel says. “You’re talking about like in those old movies where someone will follow some animal for awhile then ride off on it.”



“Yep.” Dusty says. “Or find one when it’s a baby, or hurt, or scared…they’ll stop what they're doing to rescue some random other species that they know will just run of without another thought. That’s why they built the station, they could have pulled out but ISTC called in reinforcements instead. Almost all of them, whether they’re with some agency or not, will answer a distress call from any species. They will literally die trying to help someone they have never met, and if you ask them why they just look confused.”



“They sound complicated.” Diesel says. 



“They can have a very strong group bonding instinct.” Dusty laughs. “They’ll even do it with, like, actual inanimate objects. She’d talk to the human equipment at the water plant, my truck, all sorts of shit, be all nice when it worked right and threaten to send it to the junkyard when it was busted, pet it and shit, it doesn’t seem that weird ‘cause the Marasats do the same thing, but then you think…”



“Metal is inorganic.” Diesel says. 



“They can interface with things, make them into extensions of themselves.” Dusty says thoughtfully. 



“How?” Diesel asks. 



“I never asked, I didn’t really realize it until later.” Dusty says. “She got me doing it with the truck and Mom called me on it.” 



“And you were involved with this mysterious creature?” Diesel asks. 



“Oh, it’s not like that. I mean, that’s just, like, underneath. But like I said, she was one of us. It was like, oh, that’s kind of scary for a second, but then…she was so much fun. I never saw her do any of that shit, except for the door, and playing with anything that couldn’t run away fast enough. And she could…she worked at that plant during that day, but she came out with us at night and got up on stage.”



“She’s a singer?” Diesel asks. 



“Well, she can, if you harass her enough. But no, that’s not what she did.” Dusty smirks at her. 



“Bullshit.” Diesel says. 



“Nope. Holy fuck, that was-” Dusty bangs his hand on the desk. 



“Gross!” Diesel says loudly. 



“She really was fun, though. She liked the old TV and radio broadcasts, and she actually understood, like, all of them. The old stuff, the newer stuff, someone would say something and she’d just start talking and explain what they really meant and it was like…I dunno, I’ve never met a human like that before.”



“Ok, so she’s a weird history nerd. That makes sense, now.” Diesel laughs. 



“I guess she is.” Dusty laughs. “I never thought about it that way. She could do a lot of that stuff, too, she didn’t just know about it. I guess they still use some of it out in the colonies, they’ll just start, like, rolling their tech back until they’re just muscling shit around again.”



“Do they all get taught to do…all that…then?” Diesel asks. 



Dusty shakes his head. “I don’t think anybody really needs to teach them. They get, like, basic instructions and then figure it out from there. It was like, she’d look around, and look at one thing, and another thing, and another thing, and think about it, then just, like, start putting stuff together. You’ve seen them do that, there’s that show where it’s all the guy does. They’re smart, D, like, scary smart, all of them, capable if, just, incredible destruction. They tore up the surface here, and that was trying to minimize damage, they were really careful about what they took out but they took it the fuck out.”



Diesel is giving him a slightly worried look. She can speak English really well, but that’s because she grew up hearing it from the band and all these old broadcasts that are all over. She doesn’t really know all that much about human history, or what they do in other parts of the universe. She has a vague understanding that they occasionally actually started wars on planets they had no business being on in the first place, but all of that happens so far away, it doesn’t seem real. 



There’s nothing out here the humans are interested in, really. Rycacia sustains life, but probably wouldn't anymore without the flora. They did bring in some alien animals and plants and stuff to try and fill in the gaps after the planet was actually exposed, and some of them do OK. The only thing it’s actually useful to them for, as far as Diesel knows, is as a stop between two sectors that have more going on. There’s transport of goods through here, now the station has been built, and ISTC had some sort of base here before that. 



They seemed like little yappy creatures. Very few of them are even as tall as Diesel, and she’s on the short side. They’re built like Rycacian children almost, standing up weirdly straight rocked back on their heels, looking up with eyes that seem almost too big for their faces. They always act kind of scared, too, you have to be careful not to show emotion too intensely or they’ll get jumpy and a lot of them are obviously scared you’ll literally bite if they touch you. Her dad had explained that the Rycacions resemble a kind of large predator on Earth and it makes them instinctively nervous. He’d said they’ll get used to you after awhile and stop acting like that, and some of the ones on Falcron will just come up and treat you like a normal person, but there aren’t many around here. Well, none right here, obviously, how would they get out to Factory Road in the first place. There aren’t any in the nearest town either, though. The closest humans she knows of live in Hangdog, which is really far away, and the only one she’s really talked to is the DJ at that radio station. 



The display flickers, then a video begins to play. It’s drone footage, taken inside of Falcron Station. May is on stage, there’s another human Diesel doesn’t recognize and a group of other humans that look familiar. 



“Who is that band?” Diesel asks. 



“That’s Walker John.” Dusty points. “Part of his band.”



“Ok, sure.” Diesel says. “Right, I’ve seen him up there. They’re pretty good. Is she, like, involved with…”



“Y’all are really going to make me do this.” May says into the mic. 



This doesn’t look like an actual show, the stage is really just a raised area in some officer’s lounge. May is wearing uniform pants but has the rest of her stuff off, down to a T- shirt with some sort of slogan on it that they can’t read from this angle. The people seated around the room apparently are going to make her do it, and comment to that effect. 



“Fine, fine.” May rolls her eyes, turns to say something to the band. “I’m gonna do Fleetwood Mac.”



Diesel turns the volume up, the audio quality is poor, but even so…she’s never seen anything like that outside of the old videos. You can always tell, with the modern stuff, even if they’re using the original language. Sometimes it’s hard, it took her a long time to get to where she could spot it, and it’s something you sort of feel.



May looks directly into the drone, it’s as though she’s making eye contact with them even though the date on this video is several years ago. “If you don’t love me now, you will never love me again…”



Dusty pulls back slightly in surprise, then laughs sheepishly. Diesel laughs, too, but she’d also been unsettled for a second. 



That’s apparently all the video the drone has, when May leaves the stage it cuts off and goes back to the local weather broadcast. 



“I thought she didn’t sing with you.” Diesel says. 



“Not up on stage, not that often. But other times, yeah, she will. You can get her going, it’s not that hard, she knows all this old stuff. Like, really well.” Dusty says. “Or, I mean, that’s how it used to be, and it looks like they harassed her into it there.”

  


Dusty wanders off after that. Diesel looks around until she finds Benni, who is making notations on sheet music as she plays an electric keyboard. Diesel listens to her for a few minutes, until Benni glances over. 



“Do you know anything about Fleetwood Mac?” Diesel asks. 



Benni blinks several times, plays several chords. “Took my love, and I took it down…

They called Stevie Nicks ‘the White Witch’.”



“What does that mean?” Diesel asks. 



Benni keeps playing Landslide as she decides how to answer. “It means they can do things, they have…powers…that other humans don’t, but they don’t do bad stuff. Like, um, Samantha.”



“Magic.” Diesel says. “Can it work across space and time?”  



“I think so, I dunno. Why?” Benni arches an eyebrow. “You think someone put a spell on you?”



Diesel laughs. “No, it’s just, that girl, May…”



“Oh, for fuck sake, is your dad still on her?” Benni rolls her eyes. 



“Yeah, look, anyway, I looked up her records and-” Diesel puts a hand in front of Benni’s muzzle to stop her interrupting “and it played a video of her singing.”



“Please don’t tell me he wants to fucking hire her, I’ll kill him.” Benni groans. 



“Just, listen for a second.” Diesel says. “She was singing that ‘Chain’ song, you know? And it was like, like she looked at him, and was talking to him.”



“It’s called a fourth wall break, honey.” Benni says. 



“Not like that. I mean, yeah, sure, fine, she looked right at the drone camera to be dramatic, whatever, I dunno, but it was like…not like she saw him but…” Diesel trails off. “I think she actually may be kind of badass, a lot of her record has been redacted.”



Benni shrugs. “Or she’s sucking someone’s dick. Sorry, sorry, I’m sure she’s a lovely girl who would never stoop to that. She’d make them stand on a desk.”



Diesel snorts. 



She’s wandering aimlessly around later when Vincent shoves a box into her arms and makes her help him set up the stereo he’d dragged off of the road and mostly fixed. 



“Did you like May?” She asks. 



“She was a lot of fun.” Vincent says. 



“Was she a witch?” Diesel asks. 



Vincent laughs. “In what sense of the word?” 



“Like Stevie Nicks.” Diesel says. 



“Oh, that kind of witch. I dunno, maybe.” Vincent shrugs. “I don’t think you can tell just by looking.”



“Could she have…done something, to dad?” Diesel asks. 



Vincent laughs. “I don’t think she needed to work magic on him, not that kind, at least.”



“Dad says she’s smart.” Diesel says. 



“Seemed that way last I knew.” Vincent says. 



“So, she’s got brains, she can sing, and ISTC was paying for everything? Why was she hanging out with you guys, then?” Diesel asks. 



“Thanks,” Vincent says sarcastically, then sighs. “There’s something…wrong with her. I dunno if she’s sick or something. The other humans can smell it, I guess, they didn’t want anything to do with her.”



“Aw, that’s sad.” Diesel says earnestly. “She’s so pretty, too.”



“Yeah, but that’s just the way they are.” Vincent shakes his head. ”Why all the questions?”



“Dad made me get her records from Falcron.” Diesel says. 



“Made you, huh.” Vincent smirks. 



“He likes her.” Diesel says. 



“I know.” Vincent says.



“You don’t think we have anything to worry about, right?” Diesel asks. 



“From May?” Vincent arches an eyebrow. “I mean, I don’t think your dad is in trouble with the law, if that’s what you mean. ISTC doesn’t ask, if they think you’re involved with something, they’ll just grab you and worry about red tape later. They’re scary, man.”



“But, we do take shit up there we aren’t supposed to.” Diesel says. 



Vincent makes a ‘so-so’ gesture. “I mean, yeah, but they don’t bust people for that shit out here. If ISTC is involved, they’re after a human, not one of us. He said she was asking about HDC, probably just checking in on everybody that’s going in and out. Don’t worry about it.”



“I’m not really worried.” Diesel says. “Not about getting busted, anyway.” 



Vincent drums his fingers on the stereo, presses the power switch. Someone had left an old cassette tape in, and it starts rolling,  “If you don’t love me now, you will never love me again-” Diesel snaps her hand out and shuts the device off, Vincent gives her a curious look. 



“Benni said they can do things.” Diesel says. 



“Fleetwood Mac?” Vincent asks. 



“Witches.” Diesel says. “Like, Marasat shit.”



VIncent arches an eyebrow. “Can’t you do that?”



“Well, I mean, kinda, but that’s different.” Diesel says. 



“Cause they’re from the other side of the known universe.” Vincent laughs. “Things aren’t the same everywhere, you know.”



“I know that.” Diesel rolls her eyes. “But, like…they just do stuff with their hands, in the movies. Most of them, I mean. I thought the other stuff was just made up, when the shows are supposed to be about real life it’s always a human being, like, um, having some problem, right? Like, they think it’s like that, but it’s not.” 



“Well, yeah, but the Marasats also can’t pick you up and throw you from across the room or make you walk off a building or some shit, either.” Vincent shrugs “You’ve heard the same stories.”



“Those are to keep kids from getting stuck down Marasat holes and shit.” Diesel waves a hand. “I know they have the same type of bullshit stories, Spirit of Lonely Water and whatever.”



“I really don’t know about that, sweetheart.” Vincent says. 

  
  


When May gets back to her quarters later, she finds that a pigeon-pumpkin has built a nest on her bed and is sitting on an assortment of decorative squash. The squashes grow eyes and open beaks when she removes the pumpkin bird, they make an assortment of random traffic sounds. May groans and puts the bird back down, muffling the engines and honking. She pulls the blanket over, shoving the nest against the wall so she at least has room for her feet down there. 



Rahal comes in, the door should theoretically refuse everyone except May entry but in typical fashion Computer picks and chooses which rules to follow. She’s got a pumpkin bucket that seems to be full of candy, and has a fluffy black bundle secured against her with the other arm. When she gets in, she leans down and opens her arm, letting the furry object tumble to the floor. It’s a round black kitten, as in, literally ball shaped, it’s tiny legs positioned at the very bottom of it’s body so it can bounce around like a partially deflated balloon. 



“Don’t you know black cats are bad luck?” May pats the bed. 



The imitation cat bounces over, the pumpkin bird eyes it suspiciously. A chorus of rude comments in New York accents come from the squash, though they remain hidden. The kitten barks like a dog, May makes a frustrated gesture. 



“Hey, boss, you can read English, right? Like, the old stuff?” Rahal asks. 



May looks over, Rahal has dumped the bucket of candy out on the floor and is sorting through it. There s a small book included among the toys and edible items, it’s this that she’s currently holding out in May’s direction. May takes it, there aren’t very many pages and it would almost qualify as a pamphlet if not for the stiff covers. There isn’t anything written on the front or back, but there’s a grandfather clock embossed on one. May takes it that’s the front and opens it, the pages are filled with English text, fairly large, slightly uneven, like an old printing press. 



“Grandfather, grandfather, has a box, Keeps it safe with a thousand locks, Opens the door when somebody knocks.” May says. “Some sort of kid’s poem. Maybe some schoolyard thing, it starts counting here…someone’s at the door…lock the gate…”



“That’s a weird thing to put in here, isn’t it?” Rahal says. 



“Maybe it’s for the Rycacians. Some of them can read stuff like this.” May says. 



“Like Dusty?” Rahal says. 



“Y’all seriously need to quit.” May says. “But yes. Like everybody in Factory Deal, at least, I assume Benni does, too. She can obviously sing, sounds like she talks alright, she’s way too hot not to be a total weirdo.”



“Are they really all that weird?” Rahal asks. 



May laughs. “You’ve never lived on the surface, have you. Yeah, they’re weird. This is, like, art and entertainment, right? And it’s not, like, models and shit, right, clothing designers don’t make people get all the way out here to watch some runway bullshit. Some photo shoots, OK, but might as well just go balls to the wall there and hit the surface for that. Hell, there are two cities down there where that’s, like, their thing, and they look way nicer than this place. Nah, this is, like, not really leaving the planet, ride a bus here level.”



“Sorry?” Rahal says. “What’s a bus?”



“Point is, folks up here are kinda weird and they managed to find a way to make that entertaining.” May says. “Factory Deal doesn’t seem weird to you and me, because we keep old music alive anyway. I’m sure you know songs from way back before that stuff they cover sometimes, you probably just don’t realize how old it actually is. That band that was here the other day, the human one, the girls with violins and stuff? That was, like, hundreds of years before rock music came along.”



“So?” Rahal says. “Folks used to do that stuff at campfires when I was a kid.”



“Humans, yeah.” May says. “What if they were playing some random music from another species way far away, that’s so old that the aforementioned species doesn’t even really speak it anymore and had to re-learn?” 



“That’s pretty weird.” Rahal admits. 



“It gets even weirder.” May says. “See, yeah, ‘specially after humans started hanging around, you have these novelty acts basically, bands that are covering old music in English and maybe speak it a little, but not to the extent where they actually sound like they are from that time and place. It’s hard to explain but…” 



“They talk like you.” Rahal says suddenly. 



“Pardon?” May arches an eyebrow. 



“You always talk to the computer in English, and it always sounds like the way they do it, in the interviews and stuff, and when he’s talking to the audience.”



“Yeah, I guess so.” May says. 



The cat ball has gotten up the nerve to pounce on the pumpkin bird. There is an eruption of honking, crashing sounds, and angry shouting. May rolls off of the bed, grabs the blanket and pulls the whole mess to the floor. The kitten bounces away, the pumpkin bird somehow manages to take flight and makes a wobbly trajectory toward the air vent. 



“You’re going to get-” May winces as it strikes the vent. “Stuck.” 



The bird struggles for a moment, then desolidifies into a blob and squeezes through. The squash chicks flutter after it, still calling insults down at the cat. 



“Does your translator actually work on that stuff?” Rahal asks.



“Assets?” May asks. 



“That weirdo English.” Rahal says. 



“It’s not ‘weirdo’, and no.” May says. 



“Does it work on advanced Rycacian?” Rahal asks. 



May arches an eyebrow. “No, why?”



“So you, just, like, speak those languages by yourself.” Rahal says. 



“Shocking, I know.” May says. 



“Does it actually translate anything?” Rahal asks. 



“Oh, yeah.” May says. “Just, not the way it’s supposed to. It goes one way really well, it’ll, like, show you what someone means, but it can’t go the other way. You can use it to learn, though.”



“Is that what you did?” Rahal asks. 



May looks at her for several moments, clearly considering her answer, then says “No.”



“That must have taken forever.” Rahal says. 



May shrugs. “I have a lot of free time.” 



“I like Halloween.” Rahal changes the subject. “We didn’t do anything like this when I was growing up.”



“Yeah, they have a lot of fun with it.” May says. “They used to actually go door to door, you know, the kids dressed up and knocked on doors and basically shook down whoever was inside for food.” 



“What?” Rahal laughs. 



“Yeah, ‘Trick or Treat’, it’s a threat. I’ll play a trick on you unless you give me something. Not that kids usually did that, I mean, not unless whoever answered the door was just a real dick about it.” May laughs. “It’s just sort of going with the theme, the kids represent bad stuff that could happen, you know, like, a tree falling on your house or whatever, and you ward it off by literally offering them something.” May says. 



“That’s weird.” Rahal says. 



“Well, ok, yeah, I guess.” May shrugs. 



“So why do they dress up?” Rahal asks. “Just, because it’s fun?”



May thinks about her answer for a minute. “On Halloween the outside and the inside can become one and the same. You don’t wear a costume, you take ownership of the thing that it represents. For a few hours, if you do it just right, you can become who you really are.” 



A crow appears from nowhere and lands on May’s shoulder. May looks over at it. “Say something deep.”



The bird tilts it’s head at her. “I don’t believe in witches, but they exist.” 



“Birds can’t talk.” May says. 



“Then I guess we both have something to answer for.” The crow winks. 



It takes off, triggers the door to open and let it out with the little cat ball close behind. They can hear it singing loudly until the doors close again. “Chains keep us together, running in the shadows…”



“The fuck is wrong with this place.” May mutters. 



“Did that thing just insult you?” Rahal asks. 



“Hard to tell.” May says. 



“You haven’t been cursing folks or something, have you?” Rahal teases. 



“Imma curse you with intestinal distress.” May says. “You shouldn’t eat that much candy.”

1ohz0xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NMS_Hunting_Colossus/comments/1ohz0xu/tips_for_hunting_colossus_effigies_nms/,Tips for Hunting Colossus Effigies NMS,"Hello my fellow explorers! I am here to try and start a group dedicated to hunting The Colossus Effigies in NM. Here are a few tips on getting started to hunt down those giant Colossus Effigies.

1. Look for planets that have the Title of Relic, Ruin or Reliquary. These tend to ""almost"" guarantee a Colossus. These planets are more typically found in Dissonant Systems. Color of the system doesn't matter.

2. Be ready to test your patience. Grab a cup of coffee or two and get comfy. This could take 30 minutes or a few hours.

3. Using a corvette is optimal. You can set your vessel on cruise control and go into 1st person and surf up top of your corvette. You will want to make sure the vette is optimized with some kind of hatch to climb up and out on top to allow you to surf and search. The speed of the autopilot is perfect. This speed allows your video card to be able to read the textures appearing on your screen. \*you can only see what is rendered. Colossus are huge, takes longer to render in the model.

1ohyy43,https://www.reddit.com/r/HangDogCityLimits/comments/1ohyy43/hangdog_city_radio_11/,Hangdog City Radio 1.1,"The Rycacians are on stage in front of an energetic crowd. There are four of them, three males and a female, and an unattended mic stand center stage. Most humans would say they look a bit like dogs around the head, with a long muzzle and large, expressive ears. The female has an intricate coat pattern of stripes and spots, her mane scattered black and white, she’s wearing quite a bit of jewelry. One of the males, the one holding the bass guitar, has a similar pattern, the other two have solid coats. Someone offstage gets the female’s attention and she raises her mic.



""Oh he is? Alright! I'm Benni, this is our guitarist Vincent, Mac on bass, Rick is our drummer and...""



The lead singer enters stage left and the crowd breaks into cheers and applause. Benni looks him up and down and makes a face. He’s not particularly tall, rather gangly, with uniform tawny brown fur. He also looks like he’s been rolling around in the dirt. 



He takes a mic. ""What?""



""How'd you get so dusty?"" Benni asks. 



He looks down at himself, slaps his pants. A cloud of dust rises up and the crowd laughs. 



""I live on a dirt road."" He shrugs, then winks at the crowd, eliciting laughter and cheers. 



""And after his long, loooong, loooong ride down that dirt road to get here-""



Benni stops mid sentence and coughs, goes over to get a bottle of water and takes several swallows. Dusty rolls his eyes and motions ‘wanking it’. Benni returns to center stage, gives him a stern look, then raises a hand. “Two.. three…four!”



A little female Rycacian child, around five years old is standing at the window. It’s the middle of the night, the street lights are on but most of the houses are dark. Her name is Diesel, and she’s Dusty’s daughter. 



Dusty enters the room.  ""Hey, I thought you were supposed to be in bed.""



Diesel shakes her head absently. ""It's too loud.""



“Up here?” Dusty motions to her head, and she nods. He leaves briefly and returns with a pair of headphones. ""Do NOT tell Mommy I did this.""



He runs into his wife, Sophia, in the hall a minute later. ""Where have you been?"" 



""Up on Factory Road."" Dusty says. 



""Doing what?"" Sophia asks. 



""Fixin that old clunker Mac's dad left him."" Dusty says. 



Sophia groans. “Oh, come on. That piece of shit is never gonna fly again.”



Dusty shrugs. “Sure it will, we’ve got spare parts.”



Sophia waves him away ""Go take a shower, you smell like sex in the garage.""

  
  


Several days later, the clunker is in repairs. It...does not look amazing. The ship is old, and it’s been allowed to sit in a barn for decades. But it was made by some human somewhere, and machines made by humans can be fixed. Human machines don’t care where something came from or what it’s made of, it’s about pushing and pulling and moving electricity from one place to another. You can cannibalize other machines, even replace parts with organic components, if it works it works. There are plenty of human machines around here, old cars and trucks and the occasional ship. 



They could theoretically just replace the mechanical components with organic ones, you can buy a kit that will supposedly do it from the Marasats. But it’s not just about having a working method of transportation, it’s about aesthetic. And besides, they all like the human tech, you can see what things do, and they spend a lot of time documenting everything. There had been piles of paper instructions stashed in the cockpit repair box, apparently the human that made it had been sure to keep everything that came packaged with the components. 



It was legitimately a bit of a mess, everything that wasn’t made of metal had fallen apart and it’s definitely got some rust issues, but it’s far from a lost cause. Mac is the only one in his family who can understand any of the human languages without a translator, which is why he’d eventually been saddled with the ship. He’d just let it sit there for years, Vincent had a ship they’d been using, but he had to sell it earlier that year. Mac definitely wouldn’t try to go long distances, and theres no way its safe for actual space travel right now, but the engine does turn over and they’ve gotten her in the air a couple times.  



A beat up pickup bumps up along the road, Dusty gets out and pulls Diesel through the drivers side. 



""Well hey there, babydoll!” Mac takes the child. “You gonna hang with us today?""



“Yeah, Mommy had to go off planet for awhile.” Dusty says. 

  
  


They’ve been there for about an hour when Diesel gets Dusty’s attention. ""What's that, daddy?""



The adults all stop what they are doing and look where she’s pointing. Vincent slowly lowers the tool in his hand. ""Fuck me.""



Huge black worms are swarming toward them, moving incredibly fast. They topple and roll over trees, leaving slimy wreckage that emits a noxious chemical mist. There’s nowhere for the Rycacians to go but into the ship and hopefully up. The engine catches immediately and Vincent yanks the controls upward, the stabilizers aren't working correctly and they rock and shudder but the ship is able to rise and hover. There is a rough circle of destruction, structures collapse, something is on fire, vehicles tear away as people frantically flee the area. 



""What the everloving fuck!” Dusty says angrily. “Why are there so many of them? Where the fuck did they all come from!""



A few miles away, Benni is standing in front of her bar, a hand shading her eyes. She’d heard the alert go off and is now watching as emergency vehicles stream by in both directions. The affected area covers where Dusty lives, she’d tried to contact him but first gotten no answer and then a message that the system was temporarily down. Mac and Vincent hadn’t answered, either, she’d gotten hold of Rick but he was miles away visiting his sister. 



These things, whatever they are, had started appearing a few years ago but have now become a massive problem. They’re apparently related to a very common kind of detritus worm native to this planet, why they suddenly became massive and apparently bent on destruction is a mystery. They seem to shake off most of what the Rycacians can throw at them, the response has been growing steadily more aggressive. 



A particularly gnarly POS limps over and stall/lands in the lot behind the bar. Benni goes back to see if it's somebody she knows and is very relieved to find her missing friends. Mac takes Diesel, and they and Vincent go inside. 



""How bad is it?"" Benni asks. 



Dusty shakes his head. ""It's bad. BAD bad.""



An emergency siren begins to wail. Dusty grabs her hand and pulls Benni inside, slams the door. Ship engines roar overhead, followed by a thin mist of falling particulate.  



""Does that shit actually do anything?"" Benni asks. 



""Besides killing our kids?"" Dusty asks.



Benni looks over at Diesel, who is at the bar drinking a soda and kicking her legs in time with the drums of whatever is playing through the headphones. 

  
  
  


Twenty years later…



A human female officer is sitting in one of the generic security stations on Falcron Station with her feet up on a panel. Her name is May, and she is thoroughly bored. She sits up abruptly and leans forward, taps a display. An image of a Rycacian comes up, Dusty’s ID from the system on Falcron. May pulls his file, access the information for his transportation and looks at the ship specs, then footage of it from the landing bay. It’s a piece of shit, it’s amazing it even makes it up here. 



""Computer, will you bring up security footage from their last visit here? Can you order these chronologically for me please?""



The screen goes black, then begins with the bay security cameras. 



“Spin on.” May says and the footage speeds up until she motions for it to return to normal speed. The drone security at Club Mango, following them as they go through the maze of backstage halls. They veer off when the band enters a green room. The footage switches to the show floor feed, the drones circling the stage and getting close ups of the band. Most of them are onstage, Dusty is talking to one of the dancers.

""Wake up!"" Someone jostles her seat hard enough to make May jump. 



""What!"" May twists around to find Rahal. 



Rahal is a security officer as well, though she’s considerably younger than May. She was assigned to Falcron a few years ago, and quickly became what the station supervisor referred to as May’s Minion. 



“He's hot, isn't he.” Rahal says. 



“Adam?” May asks. 



“Adam? Who’s Adam, wasn’t that…oh my GOD you KNOW him!” Rahal squeals. 



May grabs her arm. ""Shut up! You want everybody to know?""



""Kinda"" Rahal giggles. 



“Look, that was a really long time ago.” May says. “They weren't famous or anything.”



“Did you just, like, know him socially or…” Rahal prompts. 



“I refuse to answer that question.” May says. “Don’t you have work to do?” 



""Sir, yes sir."" Rahal salutes and squawks like a chicken. 



It takes a very special sort of person to live and work long term on this particular station. Falcron was originally manufactured during eradication efforts on the planet below, controlled by ISTC, who regulates travel and shipping between planets, and a hospital. 



After the eradication, the station was expanded and is now largely dedicated to shopping and entertainment. There are around a thousand permanent residents, around half of which were displaced by the infestation. The expansion was done by Marasats, who were very well meaning in their attempts to create a pleasant human habitat but missed the mark slightly. 



The aesthetic modeling hide it in the civilian areas, but you’ll still start to see things that are just a bit off after awhile. The way things don't “start” and “stop”, they grow from each other, the way nothing ever seems to have a straight edge, the way the layout of the corridors doesn't actually make any sense. The material behind the manufactured panels is a network of glowing roots and bulbs that twitch and flash as signals run through. In the lower decks, it doesn't even look vaguely like a station anymore, just tunnels of flora occupied by Marasats and the occasional other bizarre life form. 



For some reason which has baffled everyone, the place is also home to a thriving colony of pigeons. They perch, nest, and poop where they like, and are apparently impossible to get rid of. 



""Computer!"" May says. 



""Yes, Captain?"" The computer speaks in a soothing but no-nonsense female voice. 



""Oh, I like that one."" May says. ""What voice is that?""



""This voice is labeled ""Ship Computer Wife Classic"", Captain.""



""Do you always have to call me 'Captain'?"" May asks.



""Yes, Captain."" The computer says somewhat sarcastically. 



May makes a face. ""Fine, whatever. Can you look up this band, ah, Factory Deal?""



""What would you like to know?""



“Let me see their finances.” May says. 



A spreadsheet appears. May isn’t looking at the screen, anymore, she’s pulled it on her onboard display. 



“That can’t be right.” May says. “They’re flying around in a fifty year old hunk of junk, why would they…is it just aesthetic? Do they own properties or something?”



“Factory Road Productions, registered landowners.” A flyover comes up. 



It looks like it was an actual industrial facility at some point, and it's clearly out in the wastelands somewhere.



“Do we have better footage?” May asks. 



The computer thinks for a few seconds, then begins to play various clips from interviews and music videos. 



There is definitely a professional feel to at least the interior of two of the buildings, but it looks like most of it has just been maintained enough to keep the weather out. 



“Didn't he have a kid? That died or…something?” May asks. 



“Diesel, ‘Baby D’, age 25.” An image comes up. 



“Oh, she’s not dead. That’s…good? I guess?” May says. “Is there footage of her?”



A video comes up. Diesel is on stage in front of a crowd, a banner behind her reads “Falcron Hospital Annual Benefit Concert”. She looks like her father, or at least the way he did at her age. She’s rather small, tawny brown, slightly scruffy, but so exuberantly expressive it’s hard to look away. 



“When I was little, little little, I got sick, y’all. Bad. I thought I was gonna die. Everybody *else* thought I was gonna die. But then, the power of music cured me.” Diesel pauses to let the crowd react. “No, seriously, y’all, let's hear it for the excellent staff at Falcron Hospital, they save lives, please donate generously.”



""Misuse of company resources!"" A male voice from behind her. 



May turns around to find Neil jabbing a finger in her face. He’s Falcron’s resident bureaucrat, and seems to have made a hobby of finding reasons to write May up. Doing so has absolutely no effect other than him occasionally receiving memos about excessive paperwork. 



""Oh, blow me."" May says. ""537B, Cornelia Robinson, refuses to clean up after her dog. You can catch her if you hurry, he's five million years old and it takes awhile for him to pop a-""



Neil throws his hands up. ""OK, ok, you don't need to look at the screens. Fine. That still doesn't make watching a show work related.”



“It might be, though.” May says. “You know anything about this ‘Dusty’ character?” 



Neil blinks at her in surprise. “The singer? I’ve heard they do a lot of charity stuff and he’s supposed to be pretty nice. Was that who you were looking at?”



“I knew him, about a million years ago.” May says. “We lost touch.”



“That is *super* not work related.” Neil says. 



“Well, no. But…look at that ship, and they apparently live in an actual, like, factory. Or what's left of one.” May says. 



“I mean, I think that's sort of their thing. They leaned into the post-apocalyptic vibe pretty hard.” Neil says. 



“But they get paid, right? The statements show transfers.” May says. “So where is it all going?”



Neil sighs and brings the records up, his eyes moving over something only he can see. 



“Well, RCV and GER are both environmental restoration, GRNR and CRME are nature management, RBR and TWS are family and housing…looks like the last time they hit Mango the profits went to the hospital here on Falcron, here’s a couple that look like local clinics. I’d say offhand the most likely thing would be petty tax and fee evasion, hardly something nefarious and definitely not our jurisdiction."" Neil says. 



“I saw him at Mango.” May says.



“Ok.” Neil says. “And he was flashing wads of cash?”



“No.” May laughs. 



“Then get back to work.” Neil says. 



May had been at Club Mango last night to look at the stage and talk to some of the dancers, but had been called away to deal with a situation in another establishment. 



The place is closed for patrons this time of day, but the doors open automatically to let her in. She hasn’t seen it with the lights up since it was constructed. The ceiling is so high, it vanishes into shadow. The wall across from the main entrance is occupied by a large stage, three sections making a slight curve. Behind the center section, a rectangular scaffold extends thirty feet into the air. Several pigeons are sitting on it, more are scattered around on the support beams for the lights and effects. 



There is a Marasat crouched at a panel, messing with something.



“Hello.” May says. “What's your designation?”



“Code.” A mix of voices, male and female. 



“Do you like music?” May asks.



“Yes, we enjoy music.” The Marasat says. 



“Were you here for Factory Deal?” 



“Program 23 sequence 8.” The Marasat says. 



“Oh, for the stage?” May says. “Can you tell me how it works?”



“The stage creates contained fields in which density and gravity may be manipulated.” The Marasat says. 



“Yeah, but how?” May asks. 



The Marasat blinks at her, looking mildly confused. That's the way they are, once you start asking questions they'll eventually be unable or unwilling to answer. 



“Can I see it? Up close?” May asks. 



“Your clearance allows it.” Code says. 



A few minutes later, May is standing on a narrow platform, looking out over nothing. She’s taken off her shoes, jacket, and most of the random crap she carries around. 



The frame in front of her is completely empty. She had expected to see *something*, but there aren't even crossrails up right now. She reaches out and puts her hand through, nothing but air. 



“Activating.” Code says. 



The air shimmers slightly, like a heat mirage, and the pigeons fly away making disgruntled sounds. When May puts her hand out again, it gives slightly then becomes solid. She steps up onto the frame, then puts a foot out and tests the surface. It feels like a gymnastic mat, gives a little but obviously solid. She steps out onto nothing and walks across to the middle. 



“Three, two, one.” Code says. 



The invisible surface vanishes and May yelps as she drops sharply, convinced for a second she is going to splat on the floor below. She stops in the middle section. Just, stops. No surface to stand on, she can twist freely. Gravity gently returns, but now it's pulling her to stage left. She turns to orient herself, and her feet hit an invisible wall/floor. May kicks off and the gravity vanishes, returns to orient her toward the other side. 



She plays around until her radio beeps and she’s dispatched to break up yet another domestic dispute between Kevin and Brittany. 



May hadn’t been transferred to Falcron all those years ago because she was a very good girl and super at her job. She was sent there because ISTC found out she’d been moonlighting as a zero-g stripper, and they needed everyone with experience up there regardless of how they got it. 



That stage is lots of things, but May is pretty sure it isn’t actually negating gravity. She’d assumed it was some sort of trick, of course, there are ways to “turn off” gravity up here, but they don’t work in a space that small. This is doing something with density, it’s not like “no gravity” it’s like a dream where you can breathe under water and are swimming around. It’s *like* zero-g, but it isn’t, you’re literally floating, not just not being pulled to the ground. 



As May is returning to her quarters later, she sees a band poster has been stuck to the door. Factory Deal, of course. It’s not for an upcoming show, though, or the most recent one. This poster is old, printed off in someone's house on paper that’s starting to yellow and crumble at the edges. The graphic is a guitar, the neck morphing into a smoke stack. 



In her quarters, May pokes the display screen at the bottom of her bunk with a foot. “Hey, you got a discography for Factory Deal?”



“Sure, hun, got that right here for you.” The computer says. 



“Oh, that’s….which voice is that?” May asks. 



“It’s called ‘That One Lady Dontcha Know’.” The computer says. 



May shakes her head. “Play something.”



“This one’s called ‘Lady at the Fuel Stop’, hun.” 



May huffs a laugh. The tune is catchy, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. They’re mostly in Rycacian, with a few common and easily recognizable words and phrases in English- “sexy lady”, “pickup truck”, “pump my gas”. 



“What about something else? They have anything that's not hot chicks and fast cars?” May asks. 



“The title of this song is ‘Roof for Relaxing’, it's very popular, dontcha know.” That One Lady says. 



The lyrics of this one are certainly more interesting, telling a somewhat rambling story in which the band repeatedly receives noise complaints from irritated neighbors which eventually devolve into a feud, riot, and May isn’t sure but she thinks the planet might explode at the end. This was almost certainly his snarky response to an actual noise complaint. 



The door opens and Rahal comes in. “What's that?”



“Your favorite band.” May says. 



“Play a video.” Rahal says. 



“Sure, hun, which one you want?” The computer asks. 



“Do you have one from Blue Star?” May asks. 



“Sure, hun. Here you go.”



Blue Star is on Rycacia. May had picked it because it was local to where he lived when they were kids, she knew he used to play there. The place has obviously undergone some renovations and updates, but it’s still only big enough for maybe two hundred people. The house lights are on low, even though the stage lights are fully up. Most of the patrons are standing close to the stage. 



The band is on stage, sans Dusty who comes out fashionably late. He starts talking to the crowd, getting down at the edge of the stage to pass things back and forth. Rahal is listening to his schtik, which is quite entertaining, but May is watching Dusty closely. After awhile, Benni breaks up the socializing and they start playing music. Dusty is dancing around with the mic, getting up close with the other band members, making eye contact and gesturing to the crowd. They’re obviously all just having a good time out there. 



“That looks like fun.” Rahal says. 



“Yeah, little local shows are awesome.” May says. “These ones up here are nice and all, but it’s all on such a tight schedule. Those places, you can just fuck around up there until the owner kicks you out.



They’ve stopped playing, and Dusty is addressing the audience again. “I was down in Hangdog the other day. You guys know where that is?”



May leans forward and frowns. 



A smattering of applause. Dusty points and waves at them. “Hey, y’all! How's your mom n ‘em?” 



Laughter, someone shouts an answer, more laughter. 



“Oh, well when they get out the hospital you tell them that's why we don't drink n drive.” Dusty laughs. “So I was out there, five million miles from nowhere, cause my dear old Mama lives there.”



The audience makes cooing sounds and he waves them off. “Oh, no, y’all, she ain't that kind of mama. No, no, she’s great though, seriously. Anyway, I was down there and she told me, she said ‘Son, I don’t like your music.” The audience laughs as Dusty arches an eyebrow. “Right? She said ‘Son, I don't like your music but there must be something to it because they play it on the radio here. All. The. Time.”



The audience cheers. 



“And she turned on the radio and goddamn, ‘Road Home’ was on!” He lets the audience react for a few seconds, then talks over them. “And I said, that's just a fluke and she said ‘oh, no, this is *request only*. So if anybody from over there is watching, we appreciate it, guys.”



May narrows her eyes. “That’s right, you go in and out of there all the time, don’t you.”



“You OK, boss?” Rahal asks. 



May doesn’t turn from the screen. “Fine, why?”



“You’ve been kind of…” Rahal hesitates. “Interested in Dusty.”



“That’s above your pay grade, sorry.” May says. 



Rahal rolls her eyes. “Bullshit.”



“How much do you know about him?” May asks. 



“I mean, I read tabloids sometimes.” Rahal says. “Apparently he has trouble with women, can’t imagine why.” 



“He’s always broke, for one.” May says. “What about other stuff?”



“Didn’t he get arrested for environmental terrorism or something?” Rahal asks. 



“That was a long time ago, and he didn’t get arrested.” May says. “He got questioned because he was in the wrong place at the right time.”



“I thought Vincent had to sell his ship to bail him out.” Rahal says. 



“Nah, they got rid of it because it was costing them an arm and a leg to maintain. Those things look great but break down all the time, and you have to get them fixed at a dealer.” May says. “I was there for that.”



“Security to Deck 12 for a…disturbance.” The dispatch comes in, stopping their conversation. “126 and Oak.”



Deck 12 is lower rent civilian shopping, and designed to look like a street with storefronts. The ceiling is made of video panels, theoretically they’re supposed to show a view of a sky but the powers that be like to play random but aesthetic footage. Right now, it’s a mass of pink jellyfish. A group of people have gathered in front of two businesses, they can hear two female voices shouting at eachothe, the owners of the two businesses. One is a pet store, the other sells herbal remedies. 



“Arrest her!” The pet store owner screams when she sees the officers. “She’s killing my babies!”



“Ma’am…” May says. 



“She’s crazy!” The other woman shouts. “The smell of imitation chocolate can not poison her dogs!”



“What about the other stuff! It’s toxic to animals! Your tea is killing my fish!” Pet Store lady screams. 



“Are you dumping it in the tank?” Tea Lady retorts. 



“Y’all…” May groans. 



“She has to move!” Pet Store Lady insists. 



“You move!” Tea Lady snaps back. 



“How many of your animals are dead?” May asks. 



“Well, none yet but…” Pet Store Lady admits. 



“And you’ve both been here how long?” May asks. 



“Three years, but…” Pet Shop Lady says. 



“So, you want me to arrest her for not killing your animals for three years?” May asks. “I’m confused.”



“The fumes are bad for them!” Pet Shop Lady says. 



“So, you have veterinary documents for their health issues?” May asks. 



“I don’t sell animals with health issues!” Pet Shop Lady says, affronted. 



“Ah, so you put them down?” May asks. 



“That’s disgusting!” Pet Shop Lady says. “My animals are all in excellent health, I don’t need to have them euthanized.”



“So, there is literally no problem here aside from you don’t like the way it smells.” May says. 



“I’m allergic to-” Pet Shop Lady starts. 



“Stop.” May says. “If you’re having medical issues, go to the hospital. Otherwise, deal with it.”



May turns to Tea Shop Lady. “Do you have anything in there that would hurt her animals?” 



“I suppose coffee isn’t good for them.” Tea Shop Lady says. “But it’s never hurt any of mine.”



“No peppermint oil or anything?” May asks. 



“The Marasats don’t like it.” Tea Shop Lady says. 



“You burn incense?” May asks. 



“Certainly not.” Tea Shop Lady says. 



“Ok, I’m gonna give the two of you a choice. There’s an empty store two blocks down. Either you figure out how to get along here, or one of you is moving. I’m gonna give you a few days to decide between yourselves, but if I hear anything else about this I’m gonna flip a coin and the loser relocates. You don’t like that, I’m gonna ticket both of you for disorderly.” 



The women grudgingly go back into their respective businesses. The crowd seems to agree overall with the tea shop owner, some follow her but none of them go into the pet store. A drone that had been circling flies away in search of something else interesting. 



They get called over to the commercial shuttle area, where May has to explain that a llama is not “carry on” and would at the very least need it’s own ticket. Then to deck 9, where Kevin and Brittany are duking it out yet again. 



“Holy fuck, you guys, just get a divorce!” May shouts as she and Rahal approach. 



This place is supposed to look like a subdivision, which means the houses have individual roofs with the ceiling above them. The video panels here are showing an actual sky right now, a red sunset with golden clouds. Brittany is on the roof, looking very dramatic against the backdrop. 



“Look, baby, I told you, I didn’t let her borrow it, she-” Kevin dodges a shoe. “Stole it.”



“Who stole what?” May asks. 



“Monica took my Roamer.” Kevin says. 



“Did you file a report?” May asks. 



“Not yet, it just happened like twenty minutes ago. That’s why I’m late.” He raises his voice and directs the last part at Brittany. 



“ISTC dispatch, we have a report of an accident. Ship has impacted the station in quadrant 847, no injuries reported. Pilot appears intoxicated.” The voice comes in through May and Rahal’s onboard communication system. 



May puts a finger against her ear, she doesn’t actually need to but it’s a visual cue she’s on the radio. “Dispatch, can you give me the make and model of that ship and the driver’s name?” 



“DelMade Roamer, model f38. Pilot is Monica Fremmel.” Dispatch responds. 



“Well, she just crashed your ship.” May says to Kevin. 



“Shit, no! I just paid it off!” Kevin wails. 



“Put in a claim with ISTC. They’ll cover stolen vehicles here.” May says. “You can probably get a pretty decent payout if you include pain and suffering. I’ll say you appear distressed.” 



Brittany climbs down from the roof and comes up to comfort her husband. They go back into the house together, May makes a rude hand gesture after they’ve closed the door. 



“You ever just want to smack someone?” May asks. 



“All the time.” Rahal says. “Don’t you get tired of this?”



May shrugs. “It’s not all that I do, you know.”



“Yeah, you sit around and watch security video and read passenger manifests and shit.” Rahal says. 



“Yep.” May says. “I am a nosey bitch.”



“You’ve been here forever. Why are you still on patrol?” Rahal asks. 



“Civillian Relations."" May says. 



“Yeah, you’re a model officer.” Rahal says. 



“People don’t talk to cops, they don’t talk to security. But they talk to me. Think about that for a minute.” May says. 



“Are you, like, investigating Dusty or something?” Rahal asks. 



“No, can you please just drop it?” May says. 



“So, you’re just watching videos and stuff for entertainment? I thought you didn’t like their music.” Rahal says. 



“I didn’t say that.” May says. “Their music is fine.”



“You like it.” Rahal says. 



“Fine, yes, are you happy now?” May rolls her eyes. 



She does actually like the music, that’s true. And she does like watching him on stage, they put on a good show. 



But that’s not why Dusty got her attention initially. Falcon seems to keep nudging him into her awareness, band posters on the walls, music in a random store, reminding her to talk to the dancers at a time when she wouldn’t be able to help but see him in Mango. 



She wouldn’t tell any of that to Rahal, of course, or anyone else. Well, maybe Jim, he understands. This place can talk to you, both in words and with actions. Once you get below the functional decks, down to the part where the Marasats live, things move in the way of dreams. And if you go far enough, to the deepest part of Falcron, the actual control center for the station…well, it’s not really a computer. 



They pass a merchant stall set up on the side of the civilian walkway, a Rycacian with an extremely puffy mane is selling bootleg merch. Among badly translated phrases in various languages and knockoff superheros is a shirt for Factory Deal. May stops and pulls it out, the merchant notices their uniforms and immediately starts stammering. 



“Gimmie the shirt and I forget about you.” May says. 



“Yeah, yeah, it’s yours. Gift from me for our hard working police force.” The merchant says, then hastily pushes his cart away. 



Rahal rolls her eyes. “You’re not allowed to accept bribes.” 



“No bribery here.” May says. “You heard him, hard working police, that’s me.”



“What, I don't work hard?” Rahal asks. 



“Here.” May hands her the shirt. “Careful if you wash it or the decal will come off.” 



There is a horse and cart coming down the walkway. Or, what looks like a horse, this one is actually a machine. Horses can survive on Rycacia and there are some down there, but large animals are generally dissuaded on the station due to the amount of waste they produce. The pigeons might be happy about the horses’s leavings, but nobody else would. One of the idiot birds has made a nest between the mock-animal’s ears and is riding there, looking around like it’s a homecoming queen. The cart looks like something from an old western, with a slogan painted in bright red across the sides, “Doctor K’s Curing Solution- all natural- tastes great- safe for children”. May rolls her eyes, all that is true, since it’s basically just sugar water with some electrolytes. It probably does make you feel better, it’s easy to get dehydrated up here, but it’s definitely not worth the exorbitant price. 



The “Dr K” brand is desperately trying to recoup it’s losses, though. It’s now owned by ‘PowerHydration Super Good Liquid Drinks Company’, who spent a lot of money only to find out the formula they had purchased was one hundred percent illegal everywhere that can grasp the concept of “toxic”. The bottles themselves are pretty nice, which is probably what they’re really selling in the end. Once they finally run out, it’s unlikely they’ll go to the trouble to produce more. 



The Marasats seem to collect glass bottles, among other things. May firmly believes the only reason this weird horse and cart wanders around is to get people to buy the bottles and then discard them. May had once attempted to explain they could just get the bottles directly, and gotten a long and rambling explanation which seemed to boil down to ‘that’s not the same’. Something about needing to find the right things, with the stress on the “find” part.

My parents split when I was in 4th grade. They never fought (at least not infront of me) and my mom simply said “we just don’t love each other anymore.” My parents raised me to be very mature for my age, therefore, I knew it was because my mom and dad are just completely different from each other. The reason for the divorce doesn’t really matter right now anyway. 4th grade was a very hard year for me, due to being bullied and insecurities (body, hair, race, ect).

I’ve never really had any friends. Not any that I can talk to about deep stuff—surface level bullshit that’s just borderline small talk. I usually just talk to tv and movie characters in my head. (I’m not crazy i swear lol). I’m being homeschooled for 8th grade, which is making me feel very lonely. The loneliness kind of just makes all of this worse because I feel like I have no one to talk to. I have a really good relationship with my parents, But my dads very emotionally detached and my mom is very emotional so sharing how i’m feeling can get complicated.

My dad’s house is the house I grew up in. My mom met some guy (45M) who had a son 3 years older than me. They bought a house together and he’s now my stepdad. He’s ok. I don’t really like him, but all the reasons for that are kinda silly. I get along with his son and my mom is happy with him. My dad didn’t move as quickly as my mom did, but he did marry one of his coworkers, (34F), who had been his friend for a long time. My stepmom has two sons, one older and one younger than me. They’re great. But I don’t know how to talk to people, so connecting is hard. 

My dad’s house has changed so much. Before my stepmom moved in, she and her kids were living in a condo. I didn’t feel comfortable there, when we’d visit. I felt out of place—like I was a walking burden just asking for water. I went through a long list of traumatic experiences in that place. After she moved in, my house became her condo. 

First, it was the couch. Same couch. Same floors. Same tv. Same curtains. Same tv stand. Same coffee table. My house quickly became a replica of a place I didn’t feel safe in. I love her. She’s amazing. But shes the only reason my safe place has been destroyed. I don’t go out of my room. My stepbrothers know my house better than I do. It makes me feel so fucking selfish for feeling this way. 

My dad’s throwing away the dining room table that my mother painted. The chairs that me and my mom made forts with. All of my relationships are strained now. Im rambling.

Here's How to Protect Your Portfolio,"**TL;DR:** World's going multipolar (US vs China vs everyone). Markets will be messy. But don't panic – here's how to keep your money safe.

**Feeling the global chaos lately?** You're not alone. The world’s power balance is shifting in big ways, and even if geopolitics isn’t your usual coffee-chat topic, it **matters for your money**.   
  
We're moving from a US-led world to a ""multipolar"" world – meaning multiple powerful countries are calling the shots. As Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong puts it, the *“****old rules do not apply anymore, but the new ones have not been written****”*. In plain English: things are **messy and unpredictable**, and we **“must brace ourselves for more turbulence ahead”**

Trade wars, tech rivalries, actual wars – all of this hits stock prices, inflation, and even your Ola ride costs. What happens out there can punch you in the wallet here at home.

But don't panic! Here's how to brace your portfolio:

# 5 Simple Tips to Survive the Chaos

**1. Diversify Like a Desi Thali**

***Don't put all your dal in one bowl.*** Spread across asset types (stocks, bonds, gold), different sectors, different geographies if you can.

The US may be a ""waning superpower"" but it's still the largest, most dynamic economy. Don't write off Uncle Sam, but don't bet only on him either. Even within India – mix large-cap, mid-cap, different sectors.

That Gold - Yup helps but don't go all in. Keep it up to max 20%.

When one investment zigs down, another zags up. Your portfolio stays balanced.

**2. Keep Your SIPs Running** 

Volatility will tempt you to pause or time the market. Don’t..

Volatility is your friend when you invest steadily – you buy more units when prices are low, fewer when high.  
  
Stopping breaks compounding. Downturns are often the *best* entry points for long-term investors.

**3. Don't Chase What's Hot Rather Focus on Basics**

Strong economies / companies survive chaos. Weak ones get washed out.

Invest in companies (or equity mutual funds holding such companies) with low debt, good management, stable profits. They're like the reliable dhaba – no matter the weather, they keep serving chai.

Avoid ""hot tips"" and meme stocks. Be a bit boring! In a wild multipolar world, **boring is sexy** when protecting your money.

**4. Stay Informed, Don't Get Swayed by Every Headline**

News will hit like Mumbai traffic – nonstop and overwhelming. 

Stay informed about BIG trends, but don't let every headline make you rejig your portfolio.

Set basic rules (""I'm investing 5+ years, won't sell on a 5% drop"") and stick to them. Geopolitics cause short-term noise, not long-term destruction.

Eyes open, ears open, **hands steady**.

**5. Think Long Term & Embrace the Chaos**

Young investors have a HUGE advantage – **time**. You can afford to be patient and let investments compound through ups and downs.

Yes, things will be messy for years. But every crisis passes, and markets reward those who ride through the storm. 

Have an emergency fund. If global chaos causes a dip, remind yourself you're buying cheaper.

Plus, as major powers clash, India might benefit – attracting manufacturing, businesses, investment. Keep an eye on these long-term opportunities.

**Think IPL season, not a single match.** Tough games happen, but with a solid strategy and patience, you'll win the tournament 🏆

# Bottom Line

The world order is rebooting. It's unpredictable and a bit scary. But you've got this.

**Diversify. Keep SIPs going. Choose quality. Stay calm through news cycles. Focus long-term.**

The global script is changing, but your financial story can still have a happy ending. Brace your portfolio – not by hiding, but by being smart, steady, and a little bold. 🌟

I've seen this play out too many times (hell, advised friends through it), and it's a classic crossroads: Love that supports your fire, or control that dims it? 

Spoiler: Most ultimatums like this aren't about protection – they're power plays in disguise. But let's break it down clean, no drama, so you can spot the flags and map your next move.

Red Flag Check #1: It's Not About the Coworker – It's About Trust (or Lack Of) 
If the issue's ""closeness"" to a colleague (coffee chats? Late Zooms? Normal work stuff), flip the script: Ask yourself, ""Would I demand he quit over a female teammate?"" If no, that's your gut screaming imbalance. Healthy love builds security together – therapy dates, open convos about insecurities – not nukes your independence. Pro tip: Next talk, lead with ""I feel"" not accusations: ""I feel trapped when my career's on the line – how can we team up on this fear instead?"" If he dodges or doubles down, flag up.

Red Flag Check #2: The Ultimatum Trap – Short-Term Scare, Long-Term Chains  
""Quit or split"" sounds romantic in movies, but IRL? It's emotional blackmail 101. It skips dialogue for demands, eroding your autonomy one ""compromise"" at a time. Tally the patterns: Past gripes on your late nights? Side-eye at guy friends? That's not worry – that's isolation tactics. 

Your move: Pause the wedding bells. Suggest a 30-day ""boundary bootcamp"" – no ultimatums, just mutual check-ins. If he balks? You've got your answer. Remember, a partner who loves your ambition cheers the promotions, doesn't chain 'em.

Red Flag Check #3: The Stakes – Your Future vs. His Comfort 
Dream job on the line? That's not just paychecks – it's identity, growth, the you that lights up. Quitting for ""us"" today could mean resentment tomorrow (kids, moves, more ""sacrifices""). Crunch numbers: What's the real cost (relocation? Skill fade?)? Then, protect it: Chat a mentor or career coach for backup plans, and loop in a therapist solo (apps like BetterHelp make it easy). If marriage is looming, prenup that career clause – test his flex.

Bottom line: This isn't ""protecting our future"" if it guts yours. Love lifts; control clips wings. If it's fixable (he owns the insecurity, seeks help), great – rebuild stronger. If not? Walking now saves years of ""what if I stayed?"" You're the prize; don't trade your spark for his shadow.

Ever stared down a career ultimatum? How'd you flip it – or bail? Spill below; your story could be the nudge someone needs.

TL;DR: If your SO demands you quit over coworker ""closeness,"" it's likely control, not care. Spot red flags on trust, ultimatums, and stakes; talk boundaries first, therapy next, walk if no change. Protect your fire.

One convo at a time – you've got the strength.

P.S. If jealousy traps or ultimatum gut-checks are hitting too close (spotting control vs. care, owning your boundaries), I've started diving deeper in straightforward articles on Medium. No fluff – just actionable tools for reclaiming your path in love and work. Latest one's on ""jealousy red flags that kill dreams"" – might arm you for that talk.

1ohyn3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1ohyn3s/how_to_finally_get_math_the_secret_to/,"How to finally “get” math: the secret to understanding the WHY, not just the HOW","Math has this weird reputation. People either think you’re “a math person” or not. Like it’s something you’re just born with. But here’s the thing no one tells you: most people weren’t taught math the way it’s meant to be understood. We were trained to memorize formulas, plug numbers, and chase grades instead of learning how to think. And now? A lot of smart, capable adults feel lost in math—not because they’re dumb, but because the system failed them.

This post is for people who feel like they’ve been faking their way through math their whole lives. If you’ve ever thought “I get the steps, but I don’t really see why we’re doing it,” you’re not alone. Most of the advice online is either way too basic or condescending, or it’s from influencers who think shouting “5 tips to learn calculus in 15 minutes!” is the same as teaching critical thinking. It’s not.

I’ve spent months going deep into the best math learning methods, podcasts, books, and cognitive science research. This is your no-BS guide to learning how to truly understand math.

First, you have to rewire how you think about learning. The psychologist Dr. Barbara Oakley, who created the popular “Learning How to Learn” course on Coursera, explains that most of us get stuck because we’re using what she calls “focused mode thinking”—trying to brute force our way with repetition—without activating the more powerful “diffuse mode,” which is how deeper intuitive insights happen. You can’t rush this. You need to build mental models, not just plug formulas.

The best explanation of this I’ve found is from Grant Sanderson, the creator of the YouTube channel **3Blue1Brown**. His visuals aren’t just pretty. They build your intuition—he shows you how math works under the hood. His video series on linear algebra and calculus will make you question everything you thought you knew about equations. It’s honestly some of the best math teaching on the internet. He explains with visuals first, equations second. That flips the traditional school model completely.

Another massively helpful concept is from the book **“How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking”** by Jordan Ellenberg. This book is a New York Times bestseller, and Ellenberg is both a mathematician and a phenomenal communicator. He makes math feel like a way of seeing the world. He breaks down concepts like exponential growth or regression to the mean with real-world examples—from politics to lottery wins. It’s one of those books that makes you think, “Why wasn’t math taught to me like this in school?” Best math book I’ve ever read. Funny, insightful, and surprisingly moving.

To practice math in a deeper way, you need to stop treating it like a checklist of problems and start treating it like a conversation. Paul Lockhart’s essay, **“A Mathematician’s Lament,”** goes hard on this. He argues that our whole math education system crushes curiosity by forcing students to memorize rather than explore. What we should be doing, he says, is learning math like we learn art—by playing, experimenting, and asking “what if?”

One surprising method that helps build this kind of intuition is using **visual problem solving apps.** **Mathigon** is a great example. It turns math into an interactive journey. Every topic is built like a story, with puzzles and hands-on experiments that help you feel the logic. It’s way more effective than drilling 50 algebra problems. And it’s designed by real educators who care about conceptual understanding, not just test prep.

To really absorb this mindset, you also need to kill the idea that speed equals intelligence. Research published by Stanford’s Jo Boaler proves that timed tests cause math anxiety, which actually blocks working memory and problem-solving ability. In short: going slow makes you smarter. She dives into this in her book **“Limitless Mind”**, where she also shows how people can rewire their beliefs about their own intelligence. She’s a professor at Stanford and one of the top researchers on math education—definitely someone to listen to.

Now if you’re super busy or overwhelmed with where to start, try making learning feel effortless. That’s where tools like **BeFreed** come in. It’s an AI-powered learning app (developed by a team from Columbia University) that turns top-tier expert content—books, lectures, YouTube talks—into personalized podcast-style episodes tailored to your interests and goals. The cool part? You get to choose how deep you want to go. You can pick 10, 20, or 40-minute episodes, and it builds you an adaptive study plan that learns from how you listen. BeFreed actually covers all the books mentioned here, even turning Grant Sanderson’s YouTube lessons into voice-based explainers. It’s perfect if you want to sneak in some math thinking while commuting or walking. And the whole vibe is focused on understanding, not quick tricks. It makes learning feel more like entertainment than studying.

Also recommend checking out the **Mind Your Decisions** YouTube channel. Created by Presh Talwalkar, it’s full of deceptively simple puzzles that force you to stop guessing and really think. He explains the logic behind every step and shows how small tweaks in understanding lead to huge “aha” moments. Watching one video a day from this channel is like going to brain gym.

Finally, make your reading list more playful. The book **“The Joy of x”** by Steven Strogatz is another essential read. It’s written by a Cornell professor who has a wild gift for making abstract math feel intimate and meaningful. He uses stories, from coffee shops to rollercoasters, to explain everything from algebra to calculus. This book will make you fall in love with math again. It’s seriously heartwarming and should be required reading for literally everyone.

If you still feel stuck, know this: not understanding math isn’t a flaw in you, it’s a flaw in how you were taught. Once you start developing curiosity instead of chasing answers, everything changes. Math is less about getting the right number and more about seeing patterns and playing with ideas. Once you unlock that perspective, it stops feeling like homework and starts feeling like magic.",3,1761620464.0,CuriousAF,0,1.0,False

1ohydj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/1ohydj2/where_to_go_on_a_date_anyone_have_any_cool_places/,Where to Go on a Date? Anyone Have any Cool Places?,"This campus is huge and has a ton of little cafes and restaurants, somebody on here has to know some cool ones. I need a place that is allergy friendly *and* budget friendly *and* clean *AND* where the customers and staff have passable hygiene.

First off, I refuse to go to Divvy's. I know it's a popular location but I just can't bring myself to financially support the guy in any way after what he did to those people. The thought of my money going to fund one of his depraved parties makes me feel sick. What the fuck did he need all of that oil for?

Also I don't drink coffee and Divvy's offers little else. They do have Nesquik chocolate milk, which is nice, but buying one on a date feels a little bit juvenile, you know? I might as well bring a silly straw and propeller hat, and wear my 'Mom's Biggest Special Boy' shirt at that point. They also sell orange juice but I hate orange juice too, it gives me heartburn. I need to find a location that can sell me a drink that I can look like a dignified adult while drinking.

Another issue is the budget. I currently have an impressive total salary of zero ($0.00) dollars, so these places need to be cheap. If my date orders a $15.00+ item or items I'm not paying for that shit, at that point I'm going to strategically fake a medical emergency and bail the fuck out. Have you seen this economy? Do I look like a fucking charity to you? 

And lastly, this place needs to be a reasonable distance from the center of the main campus. I do have a car but I like to conserve gas. Again, have you seen this economy? And I need get my steps in, so I'd prefer somewhere I can walk to, preferably within 20 minutes. This is mostly due to time, but honestly the further away, the better. Having to walk a far distance helps me filter out the weak, if I'm taking someone on a date I don't want to hear any of this ""that's too far"" and ""can we rest for a second?"" shit. Call me harsh but god forbid I want to date someone who can walk at the same pace as me, can't have shit these days.

Anyway thank you in advance for your suggestions!

1ohyd2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ohyd2f/i_left_heaven_last_month_but_now_heaven_wants_me/,"I Left Heaven Last Month, but Now Heaven Wants Me Back.","Hey everyone.  
It’s Matteo again.  
Or what’s left of me, anyway.

If you read my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oeq6sj/i_was_sent_by_the_vatican_to_help_a_group_of/) about the “research mission” in Sweden, you know most of my story already.  
You know what I saw under the ice. You know about the thing that, at minimum, remembers being an angel. I thought the worst part was over when I got back to Rome. I was wrong.

\---

Three days ago, shortly after I made my previous post, I received a hand-delivered letter.

Same red wax seal, same Vatican crest, except this time there was another mark pressed beneath it, as if it had been stamped before the Vatican crest was stamped over it: a faint triangle inside a circle.

***“Return immediately for debriefing regarding the disappearance of Sister Lucia.”***

No signature.  
When I arrived, they didn’t take me to any office; I was led through a maze of corridors I had never seen before, and down a spiral staircase that delved deep beneath the city. I was brought into a dimly lit room. Within the room were two other people, one whom I recognized as my Bishop, and another man, whom I did not recognize, but seemed to be wearing a lab coat. My blood froze in my veins when I noticed the now familiar insignia emblazoned on the left breast pocket of the lab coat-wearing man. A triangle, with a circle surrounding it, touching at the three points.

""Sit, Matteo. We have much to discuss,"" my Bishop began, a grave look on his face, ""This is Dr. Kruger, he oversees the facility where you were sent recently, and has brought some disturbing allegations against you."" He finished.

Dr. Kruger smiled slyly and turned a laptop to face me.  ""We have evidence to suggest that you were directly involved in Lucia's disappearance,"" he said, poison dripping from every word.

They showed me camera footage, presumably from the morning of my departure from Sweden. It showed the van that had picked us up from and dropped us back off at the airport, dropping *three* people back off, instead of just two. The camera feed switched to show another angle. This time, I could see the three figures walking down an otherwise empty terminal before the two on the outside grabbed the one in the middle and pulled them into a maintenance service door. The footage fast-forwarded, showing only two figures walking out.

In the video, it looked like Father Gabriel and I were responsible for Lucia’s disappearance.

I was unable to speak. The rage building in me had almost reached a fever pitch when the doctor continued.

""The other person of interest, whom you may know as Father Gabriel, has already agreed to cooperate with us in this 'investigation,'” he said, “It would be in your best interest to do the same. If you refuse, your Church will denounce you publicly. You’ll spend the rest of your life in a prison cell. Or worse, in one of ours.”

I looked to my Bishop for any sign of understanding; instead, I saw him looking at the floor, seemingly unable to make eye contact with me.

Then Dr. Kruger slid a folder across the table. Inside: a plane ticket north, and a single phrase typed on Vatican letterhead, with a wall of blacked-out text beneath it.

***“Theta-7 - Reactivation phase.”***

The doctor took my phone, and he and I departed that night.

\---

***""It looks like I'm headed back to Heaven.""***

I thought to myself. I told myself I accepted because I wanted answers, but the truth is, I accepted because I was afraid; I had no doubt that they would be capable of framing me with the disappearance, and even less doubt that they would dispose of me at a moment's notice, if I didn't comply.

They flew me in under the same gray sky and drove me down the same road back to that same blasphemous mountain.

The sign on the road was still there, but this time it read slightly differently:

***“Welcome to Heaven, permanent population: 3.”***

The gate, which had already looked foreboding, now had a guard stationed on either side of it. Each guard was holding a rifle, and at their hip hung something that looked similar to the small metal detectors that one would see in an airport, being used by security, only these were seemingly coated in a shiny silver paint.

Inside, the chapel was rebuilt. The ice beneath the glass had been fully refrozen, and additional metal rings and wiring were installed within it. The observation deck around the chapel had been removed, and instead, a command center was placed just outside of the chapel doors, with line of sight and vocal access to the chapel. In the center of the chapel, surrounding the podiums where Gabriel, Lucia, and I once stood, was a snake of thick black wires, trailing out into the center of each wall of the room except the one on which the entrance was. Beyond the glass, I could see what appeared to be three metallic spheres, pulsating gently in a familiar pattern... Three pulses, a pause, then three pulses.

Erik met me in the hallway, thermos in hand. He looked thinner than before, eyes sunken, movements slower, as if the air itself weighed down upon him.

“Didn’t think you'd come back,” he said.

“Didn’t think I had a choice,” I replied.

A familiar voice came from behind me. “None of us did, kid.”

I turned and saw that Father Gabriel was standing at the end of the corridor, wearing the same threadbare coat as before, chewing away at his gum as usual. He looked worse than I remembered; hair gone gray, eyes sharp but hollow.

“They brought you back, too?” I asked.

“Apparently, the prodigal sons get round-trip tickets now, but I'm sure you know it wasn't a first-class seat,” he said with a bitter laugh.

Erik sighed. “Both of you, keep your voices down. The mountains have ears, you know, and we just so happen to be standing inside of one right now.”

He led us deeper into the facility, towards what I knew would be our new homes.

\---

Our quarters were in the same wing as before, though locks on the outside of the doors had been installed since our last visit. I guess what Gabriel said the first time we saw this place wasn't as far off as we had originally thought. Like before, the wing had three doors. Our two doors were open, but the third one was closed.

We were locked in our *cells* for the night. A lone guard patrolled outside our rooms, carrying an identical loadout to the ones guarding the front gate. My mind lingered on the strange silver device slung similar to how a nightstick would be on a police officer's belt. I thought to ask, but I doubt I would have received a proper answer.

That night, a folded slip of paper appeared under both our doors. No signature, just a symbol drawn in graphite: three concentric circles crossed vertically to the middle by a single line, with a solid circle in the very center.

And four words written beneath it:

***“The First Has Heard.""***

\---

The next morning, Dr. Kruger assembled everyone in the rebuilt chapel. He stood at the command center like a general surveying a battlefield. Erik watched from a console nearby, expression unreadable. A sphere, similar to the ones embedded in the walls but smaller, sat alongside us in the center of the floor, pulsing the same pattern as the others.

“Today we resume resonance testing,” Kruger announced. “Fathers Matteo and Gabriel, as well as a modified RDC, designated RDC-L-1, will serve as focal conduits.”

Gabriel muttered, “Guess that’s our fancy new job title. Could have just labeled us 'bait.'”

They handed us printed sheets of meaningless syllables; vocal tones arranged like chants with no language.

Kruger called it a “Phase-Lock Chant.”

Gabriel squinted at the page. “So… we're speaking in tongues for science now?”

Kruger smiled thinly. “I suppose, if you prefer that terminology.”

They dimmed the lights, and we began to recite. The hum beneath the floor shifted with each line, syncing to our voices. Then a whisper surfaced under the noise:

***""Be not afraid.""***

It wasn't the same voice from before. It was a feminine voice, soft, far away, as if I were hearing it from underwater. Gabriel stopped reading, visibly trembling.

""Keep cadence!” Kruger snapped.

We continued to recite from the page, but nothing else happened. It was as if the facility itself held its breath after that whisper.

Even Kruger looked uneasy, though he tried to hide it behind a professional scowl. Erik avoided my gaze, typing something rapidly into his console before shutting it off.

We were dismissed for “observation rest,” while the scientist poured over their data.

Back in the corridor, Gabriel leaned against the wall, his usual sarcasm gone.

“You heard it too, didn’t you?” he asked.

I nodded.

“Female voice. Calm, like she was teaching, not warning?” he continued the question.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “And it didn’t feel quite as… judgemental.”

Gabriel laughed once, bitterly. “Good. Maybe our guardian angel finally showed up to apologize.”

Before I could answer, Erik appeared at the end of the hall, thermos in hand, face pale.

He motioned for us to follow him to a maintenance room.

Once the door shut, he locked it from the inside and leaned against a panel.

“You two need to forget that voice,” he said. “Pretend it never happened.”

Gabriel frowned. “You heard it too, didn’t you?”

Erik didn’t answer right away. He took a slow sip of coffee, staring at the floor.

“Yeah,” he said finally. “I’ve heard her before. Most of us who’ve been here long enough have. We just don’t talk about it.”

He rubbed his eyes, looking suddenly old.

“We call her the First Witness. The name isn’t official. It’s… Purist folklore, really. They say she was the first person ever to be assimilated into the Field, long before Theta-7 was even built. Before the schism, even. Some think she’s still in there, a permanent part of it now.”

Gabriel crossed his arms. “And you believe that?”

Erik looked at him. “Some part of me wants to. The alternative is even more terrifying... That it *is* *her* voice, but it isn't *her* speaking with it.”

Later that night, I found a small notebook slid under my door. There was no symbol on it this time, but someone had written one sentence in English, with careful handwriting:

***“Her name is Anja.”***

Inside were dozens of entries, scrawled in different inks and styles. Half were impossible to read; just equations, sketches of circles, triangles, or strings of numbers.

But one line, four words repeated over and over, stood out:

***""The Second Has Answered.""***

I showed it to Gabriel the next morning.

He flipped through a few pages and sighed. “Looks like we’re officially prophets in the  madhouse now, they've even given us pamphlets.”

\---

Kruger called us to the chapel again before lunch. He didn’t mention yesterday’s voice. No one did. This time, the sphere in the center glowed brighter, the rhythm faster; three pulses, pause, three again, like before.

I could feel it in my chest.

We began the chant. Halfway through, Erik’s monitor emitted a shrill tone. He shouted something to the technicians, but they didn’t move fast enough. The hum deepened, vibrating through the floor, the walls, the marrow in my bones.

Then I heard it again. Not the soft, feminine voice from yesterday, but the booming, thunderous voice from our first stay in Sweden.

***“The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”***

Everyone froze.

Kruger screamed, “Maintain cadence!” but his voice was drowned out by the thundering of the entity's, and the screaming of alarms. The glass under our feet rippled like water. A figure took shape in the reflection; six wings of light and shadow, eyes scattered across them like stars.

Gabriel whispered, “Christ have mercy…”

The moment he spoke, the reflection looked up.

\---

The alarms blared, every light turned blood-red. Erik grabbed Kruger by the collar.

“Shut it down! It's feeding on the resonance decay from L-1!""

Kruger gasped, “We're prepared this time, the lattice will hold!”

“We weren't prepared for it to consume a near *infinite* source of resonant energy!” Erik shouted, throwing Kruger aside and running for the emergency panel.

The hum fractured into words again. Two voices, spoken as if they were two members of the same choir; the woman’s voice, soft but powerful, and the voice of a man that I did not recognize, deep and sincere, filled the room:

***“We await His arrival.”***

At that moment, the visages of a man and woman appeared above the sphere in the center of the room. The figures floated through the air above the sphere.

The reflection of the entity in the glass below us vanished, and, in an instant, a third human-shaped form appeared alongside the man and woman, similar to them but bright. Brighter than the sun. Brighter than anything I'd ever seen. I could vaguely make out the form of a single halo now encircling the heads of all three figures.

There was a flash of green, and all three began to *unravel* into strings of light. The strings of the two human visages, dim in comparison to the angelic glow of the third who had joined them, wound around each other and descended toward the sphere below.

Shortly after, the string from the entity joined the newly helical structure, weaving in between the two and binding them together. The sphere continued to pulse, but when the helix met with it, the color changed instantly; it pulsed a deep, forest green instead of the usual red.

Erik threw the switch on the emergency panel, immediately darkening every light source except for the bright green sphere in the center of the room, which had now left the tripod it was sitting on and drifted upwards between the figures, unraveling into it.

""I was too late!"" Erik shouted from the emergency panel, ""It's self-sustaining, and the entity has gained full control of L-1's energy output!""

""This is unprecedented,"" Erik gasped, ""no entity has ever attempted to interface with an RDC directly before... they're literally designed to *nullify* Field resonance...""

""That's because it's not *just* an RDC, it's a *synth...""* Kruger started, but was cut off by another choir of voices, this time the *combination of all three of the voices from before*: 

***""For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.""*** 

***---***

The air split open.

Light erupted from the sphere, no longer green but shifting through every color at once. Radiant, fluid, impossibly alive. It wasn’t brightness so much as structure: columns of illumination spiraling upward, intertwining, unspooling, and reforming into impossible geometry that my eyes refused to hold.

For a heartbeat, I could see them; the two human visages from before, still suspended above the sphere, their forms no longer made of flesh or flame, but of vibrating matter and energy. Their outlines folded inward on themselves, weaving together, their luminous strands twisting in perfect mirrored motion.

The light didn’t just rise, it climbed, self-replicating in infinite recursion, folding in on itself like hands folding in the sincerest prayer. Each movement of one line was echoed by the other, creating a lattice of living brilliance that seemed to hum with intelligence.

Somewhere between those two converging threads, a third form began to grow; not emerging from, but being born out of the sphere that their essences wound into. Wings unfolded in fractal patterns. Each feather refracting the light of a thousand collapsing novae, edges rippling with translucent fire. It was beautiful in the way that an erupting volcano might be: inescapable, inevitable, and deeply unsettling.

The figure stabilized in mid-air, the combination of all three previous figures, green sphere shimmering in the center of it where a heart would it. Six wings fully extended, its body a convergence of reflection and void; half blinding, half shadow. Every surface shimmered with shifting symbols that glowed, then vanished, then returned again in different sequences, as if the air itself were writing and erasing scripture faster than it could be read.

It looked alive, but it didn’t breathe. Instead, the whole room seemed to inhale and exhale for it, every pulse of resonance feeding its existence.

The air grew heavy, and I could feel the pattern of its heartbeat inside my chest.

Three pulses. Pause. Three again.

Behind the radiance, I caught the faintest glimpse of its face or what passed for one. Eyes, infinite in number, turned outward, as if gazing not at us, but through us. And for a moment, *just a moment*, I thought I *recognized* that face.



***""Lucia?""*** Gabriel and I asked in unison.



The entity spoke, not with a voice, but with vibration; an all-consuming resonance that shaped itself into words older than language.



***""Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in this place; escape from the mountain, lest thou be consumed.""***



That was when the world began to tremble.

\---

The hum became deafening. The entire chamber pulsed with blinding green-white light as the entity’s wings folded inward, then snapped open again as if attempting to crack the firmament itself.

Erik’s voice cut through the chaos.

“The lattice is feeding it! The whole mountain is coming apart! If we don’t move now, we’ll be part of the next testament!”

He yanked a manual override lever on the wall. A series of klaxons screamed to life, and the containment doors around the chapel began to slam shut one by one as pressure built beneath the floor.

“Move!” Erik shouted. “Sublevel access hatch, now!”

Gabriel and I ran first, half-blinded by the light, Kruger close behind us, cursing in German between gasps for air. The steel grates beneath our feet glowed red-hot, warping from the energy. The hum had turned into a heartbeat you could feel in your skull.

We reached the narrow sublevel corridor. Erik dove through last, slamming the hatch behind him as the final seal above failed with a thunderous crack.

A sound like tearing fabric echoed through the mountain; a sound so loud and low it felt like the earth itself was screaming.



Then it happened.



The mountain burst open.



The entire upper structure of Theta-7 erupted in a column of molten light that tore through the stone, splitting it cleanly down the middle. 

Rock, steel, and decades of secrecy were obliterated in an instant, vaporized in a flash of green and white.

The shockwave hit us like an invisible truck. Shrapnel from the supports embedded itself in my back, and I felt a searing pain where flames had just licked at my ankle. The tunnel we were in collapsed behind us in slow motion, stone turning to vapor before it even touched the floor. We stumbled out through a maintenance shaft, barely able to see. The air was a haze of fire and snow. From the exit at the base of the mountain, we could see open sky, quickly being covered by a cloud of debris, with flashes of lightning following shortly behind it.

A figure, vast, radiant, and terrible, rose from the fissure, its six wings unfurled like curtains of light stretching across the storm. Every wingbeat sent sheets of snow and debris cascading down the slopes. Around it, the clouds turned to gold, the sky split open, and the air turned electric with the taste of copper.

We ran. The mountain behind us groaned, the snow beneath our boots glowing from the reflected light. The hum followed us: three pulses, pause, three again. Steady, relentless. We looked back, and a wall of fire was close behind, and gaining on us by the second.

Kruger lagged behind, clutching his briefcase to his chest. Erik pulled him over the edge of a ridge where we had taken cover from the blast coming our way, and tried to hold him to the ground, but Kruger tore himself free, stumbling to the ridge and turning toward the mountain. The words tore from his throat, half prayer, half disbelief.

***“My God... it’s beautiful…”***

The fire swallowed him.

For a second, I thought he had been simply annihilated in the blast, but, as the fire passed, we looked up and saw what had become of him. Standing there, rigid and glittering in the radiant green of the pillar of fire, was a Kruger-shaped pillar of salt. Only his briefcase remained, which Erik promptly grabbed.

We got up after the fire had passed and started back running. We sprinted through the storm until our lungs burned, until the ground stopped shaking and the light behind us began to fade. Only when the sound of collapsing stone gave way to silence did we finally stop.

The wind carried a faint hum, softer now, distant. The mountain was gone. In its place stood a crater rimmed with glowing glass.

Gabriel fell to his knees. “Was that… judgment?”

None of us could speak to comment, but I think we all felt the same.

The clouds above us began to close, the auroras fading, leaving only the faint green shimmer dancing across the sky.

Erik turned to face the crater one last time, thermos still clutched in his hand. His voice trembled as he spoke.

“If that was judgment, then I have my own sins to atone for.”

He dropped the thermos onto the snow, steam hissing where it landed.

“Let’s go,” he said quietly. “I know somewhere we will be safe.""

\---

I'm posting this now from my own cellphone, which, thankfully, was inside of Kruger's briefcase. There were other things in the briefcase that Erik is still trying to make sense of. Things that, according to him, are *far* worse than just what happened to Father Gabriel and me. 

Erik led us to the main road, where we managed to hitchhike back to a city; we told the terrified driver who picked us up that we were involved in a lab explosion out in the mountains... which wasn't *entirely* false, in our defense. We were dropped off at the hospital, where my ankle and back, as well as various injuries to Father Gabriel and Erik, were treated.

From the city, we made our way back towards the mountains in a minivan purchased with Kruger's organization credit card. ""They won't miss a few this much money, not after a literal mountain *full* of cutting-edge tech worth *billions* just exploded."" He had said, in an attempt to justify the action. Honestly, neither Father Gabriel nor I felt the need to justify it after today.

Instead of going back to Heaven, Erik took us to a cave, tucked deep into a ravine between two mountains. A sign outside of it read, in hand-painted letters:

***""SALVETE AD PURGATORIUM""***

And, in smaller letters below,

""**Quod purgatur, vivet.""**

I could hear an audible sigh from Father Gabriel as we entered the cave, then his usual humor broke the tension: 

***""Well, Lucia is a prophet, confirmed.""*** 

I don't think I'll be going back to Rome. Erik has agreed to answer a *long* list of questions I have about this whole experience, but let's save that for another day- it's well into the witching hour here, and I'm sure we could all use some rest.

Until next time,

I don’t even understand why I put her on such a pedestal — for what reason? I keep replaying all the hurtful things she said to me, over and over again, like a loop I can’t turn off. I keep thinking about how much money I spent on our anniversary, how I was basically robbed of $700–$800, and how she broke up with me right after I spent all that money on her. Then she still took that $70 charge for the oura ring subscription a few weeks ago about 3 weeks after our breakup but I don’t say anything about it. It’s unbelievable. I wish I could get that money — and the time, the energy — back.

And what did I get in return? A coffee machine and cologne. I want so badly to direct my anger at her instead of turning it inward, but I can’t seem to. I still have her on this mountaintop, still believing she’s the best when she doesn’t deserve that place anymore. Her family has to see how messed up she is — how could they not? You’d have to be blind not to.

I stood by her through everything — even as she went through her dad’s cancer, something that mirrored my own trauma with my mom’s death. That was never acknowledged or appreciated. I was constantly made to feel not good enough, like I had to impress her every single day — by the person who was supposed to love me. I was never loved for who I truly am, only for who she wanted me to be.

And I keep asking myself — what’s wrong with me? Am I too kind? Too good? Too successful? Too willing to give? Because I gave everything. I dropped everything — my time, my energy, my early adulthood — all for her. And what do I have to show for it? Diamond earrings she never wore, a Coach backpack she barely used and gave to her mom half the time, a $300 cooking class, birthday dinners, gifts that actually meant something to me.

Meanwhile, I’m left with a few things — colognes, an Apple Watch, a Devils game, a gold chain I’ve worn twice in two years. That’s what I get from this relationship. Oh, and I guess I got food cooked for me — maybe that’s the consolation prize.

And still, somehow, I’m made to feel like the loser. Like I’m the one who’s nothing, who won’t amount to anything. And the worst part? She truly believes she’s in the right. That her feelings are just… gone.

I'm embarrassed that I haven't left yet and that it happened at all.

We both had been drinking a little but not too much.  It was Saturday night and we had not seen each other in person for 4 days.  I told him I was unhappy he didn't want to be intimate and that so much distance was making me sad.
  We were laying in bed at night.  I knew he had recently gone for coffee with a woman who is flirtatious and I told him I knew about her.  I saw her posting about his work on facebook.  I told him he should put more effort into our relationship instead of emotionally cheating on coffee dates. He was mad I found out and jumped on top of me, striking me in the face/holding my face down on the pillow.  I said he was hurting me, i was pinned down until he stopped.  The next day my neck hurt, there were faint bruises on my chin and forehead and the skin above my lip was scratched red.

I've not really felt like myself since my divorce 2 years ago.  My ex husband was also physically violent and had hit me or been physically abusive on several occasions before I finally left.  
I keep choosing abusive men.  Why do men hit me like this? How does this keep happening?  This boyfriend is the third partner I've experienced physical violence with. I am a depressed, small woman and I live alone now.  I am never violent. I can't believe I'm having problems like this. What personality trait leads to violence?  What am I doing to prevoke this?  I really dont think its my fault but after three people I'm wondering.

1ohy58h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1ohy58h/day_3_and_already_getting_bored/,Day 3 and already getting bored,"I just started a new nanny job 3 days ago to a 14 month old boy. He is great and the family is so great. Here’s the problem, I moved to a more family centered town coming from a town that had too bougie of people. The parents I’m used to nannying for have huge playrooms with TONS of toys to rotate, backyards with water tables, chalk, bubbles, trampolines, kiddie pools, and sometimes putting ranges or more. Im also used to BUSY BUSY BUSY. normally even at this age with past nanny jobs I’m immediately flung into packed schedules with grocery shopping, running errands, taking babies to story time at the library, baby gymnastic classes, swim classes, outings to coffee shops, shopping for new toys or baby clothes, or just random target trips. 

With this new family, although their house is lovely, they have all of NK’s toys in a small wooden playpen and after 3 days of playing with him I’m already so bored. There’s a park nearby that we walk to once a day, but it’s a bit hot still (live in Arizona) and honestly still boring since he isn’t super mobile yet. I push him on swings, tell him about trees and birds, let him play with tan bark… and that’s pretty much it.  To make things more interesting for us both, I brought in some letter magnets one day and it was a huge hit with him, but now that’s all he wants to play with since it’s new lol. I also brought in some finger paints and did mess free painting so he wasn’t tempted to eat it (put a paper and paint in a ziploc and let him squish it). 

The mom works from home, my vehicle is in the shop (it will be there for a few weeks) plus they told me that they don’t take the baby anywhere really and he’s a stay at home baby for now PLUS have a small swing for him in the backyard, but he’s not allowed to play back there unless in the swing since they have a pool that’s not gated. He also doesn’t like being guided. When I went to paint with him he pulled his hands away and got upset a few times and his mom let me know he’s super independent and likes to do his own thing….so I feel kinda stuck right now on what to do with him. I want to keep him and myself entertained and keep him educated. I want to bring in more things like the pikler triangle and some Melissa and Doug food toys that I have in storage sometimes to spice it up, but I know those will also get boring soon. They’re a no electronics household which I completely stand behind. 

What do you guys do to keep yourself from falling asleep or staring at the clock too much? What kinds of activities can I come up with for super cheap or free (don’t want to ask for an activity budget right out of the gate) for a one year old who wants to do his own thing and doesn’t want to be guided?

Maybe I shouldn’t have taken on this nanny job and searched for something more immediately exciting, but I love this baby and his family so far. I just need more excitement for us both. ",3,1761618999.0,Nanny,10,1.0,False

HI guys, been lurking around the sub for sometime and the tips have been useful. Pretty common CPPS case here, used to sitting all day and long-range cycling. Daily 0.5-1 hour masturbation with edging. Often clinching the pelvis, very tight pelvis muscles and bad habit of holding pee. Going to bed late with under 7 hours of sleep. **Urine frequency and perineal/penis pain are my major concerns**.

I started out having a UTI in early August, intense bladder/urethra pain and peeing 20 times a day, which was fully cured with antibiotics. Second flare-up came in Sept after an intense masturbation. Probably caused by clinching muscle during the 1 hour session. Went to urologist in early Oct for urine and semen cultures, all came back negative. He did find calcification in the prostate and minor inflammation. He did not recommend using antibiotics and gave me painkillers/valium instead to help with sleep. Glan gets irriated by urine, I apply Cerave cream daily and dry to tip with tissue after pee, which helps.

I started stretching, taking supplements (the usual prostate stuff plus cranberry which seems to help with peeing), cutting back coffee and alcohol. Masturbate only around 1-2 time a week without edging. Limited cycling to short communtes, picked up jogging instead (2-3 times 5km weekly). Did a whole bunch of stretches, ""Happy Baby"" seems to help the most, as did jogging at moderate pace. Also tried the pain reprocessing, which helps (I was taught at school in childhood to hold pee), as did spreading my legs more on the work chair. It did flare up a few times after masturbation, eating something spicy or drinking (just one beer, but still...) but I saw improvements every week.

Now the pain in perineal area is 99% gone. No more balloon feeling. Peeing 6-8 times a day which seems normal (I drink around 2.5L). But recently hard flaccid has either flared up or become more noticeable after other symtoms have been subdued. Lost of morning wood, penis sore and stiff balls. Usually goes away after sitting down. Erection seems normal in hardness and size, but sore worsens afterwards. **Is there something I should do instead to fix this issue? Or should I keep doing the same stretches and exercise pattern? Thank you very much.**

**TL;DR: Got rid of 70% of CPPS symptoms through suggestions on this sub. Hard flaccid (gone after sitting down) with pain on the penis seems to be the only major issue remaining. Any suggestion to fix it?**",2,1761618920.0,Prostatitis,1,1.0,False

She packed up her Diet Pepsi and some clothes that wasn’t dirty and had that new man come get her down by the road ‘cause Jamie told her he ain’t lettin him pull in his driveway. She just slammed the door and went on.

When I pulled up she was long gone. Jamie was sittin out there on the porch, no shirt, jeans on, starin out at the gravel like maybe it’d talk back. His hair’s cut short now, thin up top, and he just looked wore slap out.

I been knowin Jamie a long time, way back when he was married the first time. I used to stop by back then, drink coffee on the porch when life wasn’t near this hard. Never thought I’d see the day he’d be sittin there alone like that again.

Inside that old trailer still smelt like burnt taters and smoke from that fire couple years back. You can scrub and paint all you want but that smell don’t never leave. Hunter was passed out on the couch, Cheyanne layin up with baby Bentley, cartoons flashin blue all over the room, heater rattlin like it always does.

We just sat there quiet that night, listenin to the heater hum and the wind hittin the windows. Sometimes you don’t gotta say nothin to know what somebody’s feelin.

Come mornin the coffee was on and the sun peekin through the sheets over them windows. Jamie was at the sink washin out a cup like nothin happened, kids laughin like always. He still drives that work truck checkin gas meters ‘round town my uncle’s his boss so I see him every now and then.

Truth is I’ll always love Jamie and them kids. Always will. But I was the other woman, and when Adelia came back, it weren’t her heart that broke. It was mine.",7,1761618599.0,DIANE_JamieCookSnarks,17,0.9,False

Freshman year, I met a really nice guy. We’ll call him J. We became friends and saw each other a lot because we have similar majors. Third week of classes is a cappella auditions. I meet this girl, T, who is super awesome. She and I find out we have tons of classes and become really close really fast. She joins J’s a cappella group. Almost immediately, they get together. She falls in love with him. However, because she wasn’t sure if she could handle long distance for 6 months because he was going abroad for fall quarter of the next year, she breaks up with him (despite me telling her not to). J is distraught. A week later, she regrets it (I didn’t say I told you so, but I was thinking it). However, he doesn’t take her back. T forbids me from being friends with J (he was actually going to visit me over the summer because he happened to have an internship where I live, and I had to turn him down).

Over the summer and during his quarter abroad they have phone sex even though they’re not together. He comes back and they start hooking up again. She then tells me that he’s been saying that I’m hot since freshman year. She asks me if I feel anything for him and obviously I say no. They hurt each other over this time, and they finally go no contact. 

Fast forward, it’s currently junior year. T is studying abroad. So J and I are able to be friends again, which is still a little odd because I can’t tell her. But also, it’s not her place to tell me who I can and can’t be friends with. But here’s where it gets problematic. We are getting really close. Every day we see each other I find out something new about him that matches me. We make each other laugh, we love the same music, we have the same dating values, even the same religious values. Hell, he even wants to be a Rabbi. The closer we get the more I realize how incredibly compatible we are. 

One event changes things. We both go to a mutual friend’s party. We were talking and some really drunk guy comes up to us and asks if we’re a thing. I say no, and J acts really weird about it. He then stays until I leave. Then he texts me if I got home okay. Then he asks me out for coffee. Fuck. I turn it into a business thing and say like oh I’d love to talk about an a cappella collab sure.

It’s so obviously a date. We’re just chatting and having a good time together. In order to lightly turn him down, I say that I’m talking to someone. His face drops. He leaves 15 minutes later. And for some reason, my heart sank.

A week goes by, and I did some soul searching. I think I’ve actually been in love with him since the beginning. One of those slow, friendship to lovers kind of love. Except, if I were to make it a thing, my best friend, T, would never speak to me again. I realized that we are basically made for each other. My heart hurts so much and I just don’t know what to do. It feels like if I choose my friendship with T I prevent the world from falling apart and keep my integrity, but then I feel like I’m betraying myself. I hate how my life has come to this. And because I basically turned him down, I have to figure out whether or not I tell him the truth before it’s too late and he moves on. I’ve been in denial for two years and I just can’t hide it anymore. I hate lying to myself and to everyone around me. I’ve been asked how I feel about J, and I always lie and say I don’t like him that way. But deep down, I always have. 

Anyone have any suggestions for my fucked up love life? I feel like the villain in my best friend’s life but at the same time I feel like I won’t get the chance to be with someone who was so clearly made for me ever again.",1,1761618483.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

1ohxwfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoinKudos/comments/1ohxwfi/sams_club_membership_is_15_right_now_normally_50/,Sam's Club Membership is $15 Right Now (Normally $50) - Here's the Math on Whether It's Actually Worth It,"Sam's Club is running a great promotion through October 31st - Club membership for $15 (70% off) and Plus for $50 (normally $110). 

**TL;DR:** At $15, it's basically risk-free. You only need to save $15 total to break even, which is like 2-3 bulk purchases. Plus has a 100% money-back guarantee, so you can try it and cancel if it doesn't work out.

**The Two Membership Tiers:**

**Club ($15 with promo, normally $50):**

* Access to all 600+ locations
* Scan & Go mobile checkout (skip lines entirely)
* Gas discounts
* Free curbside pickup (no minimum as of Oct 2025)
* 2 membership cards (you + household member)

**Plus ($50 with promo, normally $110):**

* Everything above, PLUS:
* 2% cash back on purchases (up to $500/year = need to spend $25,000 to max out)
* Early shopping hours (8 am-10 am vs 10 am opening)
* Free shipping on $50+ orders
* Free same-day delivery on $50+
* Up to 10 FREE generic prescriptions per month (this alone is huge if you take meds)

**Break-Even Math:**

**Club at $15:** You literally need to spend $60 total to save $15 back (assuming 25% savings vs regular stores). That's like one pack of paper towels + one bulk coffee. Done.

**Plus at $50:** This requires more thought. To break even on the 2% cash back alone, you need to spend $2,500/year ($208/month). BUT there are exclusions - no cash back on alcohol, gas, dairy, gift cards, etc.

However, if you use the free prescriptions, that's easily $12-36/month saved ($144-432/year), which makes Plus worth it by itself if you take meds.

**Who Should Get What:**

**Singles/Couples → Club ($15)**

* You probably can't consume bulk quantities fast enough
* Limited storage space
* Just grab toiletries, cleaning supplies, and non-perishables occasionally
* Expected savings: $100-200/year after the $15 fee

**Families of 3-4 → Club at $15,** ***maybe*** **Plus at $50**

* Sweet spot for warehouse clubs
* You'll actually use bulk items before they expire
* Expected savings: $400-600/year (Club) or $600-850/year (Plus if using early hours + delivery)

**Families of 5+ → Plus ($50)**

* You'll max out the 2% cash back faster
* Early hours = avoid weekend crowds with kids
* Free prescriptions for multiple family members = $$$
* Expected savings: $900-1,400/year after the $50 fee

**Small Business Owners → Plus (100%)**

* Office supplies, break room stuff, cleaning products
* 2% back on $25k = $500 annual cash back
* Expected savings: $1,200-2,500/year

**Final Thoughts**

Even if you only go 3-4 times a year for paper towels, toilet paper, and coffee, you'll save way more than $15. The Plus membership at $50 is worth it if you shop weekly, have kids, or take regular prescriptions. The free meds alone pay for the membership. Hope this helps someone!

1ohxv5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ohxv5x/aita_over_this_fight_with_my_mom_over_moving_in/,AITA over this fight with my mom over moving in with my girlfriend?,"sorry in advance for this being kind of long
for context: im 19f, turning 20 in literally two hours, and i live with my aunt because my mom had to move in to a two bedroom with her and my two siblings and didnt have space for me. my mom also has bpd.

i went to college for a year before dropping out and moving back home due to mental health stuff, and i’ve gotten a lot better. i’m a barista, i have a wonderful gf who for this story we’ll call kayla, i adopted a dog, got my drivers license and fixed my car up. i pay rent and insurance and gas and everything on my own. recently my girlfriend and i decided to move in together down where i used to go to school because she still goes there, and we’re both really excited about it! rents pretty cheap and i think i can transfer down there when it’s time to move in may (i work for the big coffee corporation.. you know the one.) 

so anyways. my mom got it into her head that on top of my share of the rent, i’d also be buying all the groceries and utilities (i don’t know where she got that from) and some other crazy stuff and texted my aunt and siblings saying “we are a team” and saying that they needed to talk to me and “uncover lies i’ve been telling” (i still have no idea what she’s talking about.) she called me to tell me we (her, my siblings, and i) were going to have a family meeting over the phone. she said “we’re not okay with you moving in with kayla” and went on to say that she doesnt think its going to work out and that she doesn’t want me locked into a lease, which i’ve already signed. i got upset and told her that she doesnt get to dictate what i do with my life and that she doesnt pay for anything for me, and she started crying and hung up before calling me back. my aunt was in the room when this was all happening and told me that what i said wasn’t okay and i apologized to my mom, saying that she did do a lot for me and i appreciated it, but she does not get to choose how i live my life. my mom then went on to say that i was basically useless and a fuck-up, said that i wasn’t going to school (which im going to go to school for free through my job), diminished my job (that i actually really love), said that i have an unreliable car (which is true, but im in the process of getting her fixed up little by little) and said “you don’t do anything”. i understand i said this to her too, but to hear her say it to me made me really upset as she never reaches out to me, so she doesn’t know how well im actually doing. she texts my aunt to spy on me and asks how im doing through her, so she has no clue how hard im working and how im trying my hardest. i hung up on her, and we haven’t spoken in probably a week. i texted my brother afterwards and asked him wtf was going on, and he said that mom made him sit down with her and my sister to grill me and try to get me to back down from moving. i understand why he did what he did, because my mom is also an abusive alcoholic who will get upset at the smallest things, so he’s just trying to stay safe, which i understand. i called kayla afterwards and she told me my mom was being crazy. my grandma also called me to let me know she got a lot of texts from my mom and said she was being crazy as well.
i guess the problem is that as much as my mom and i have a difficult relationship and even with her making my childhood a living hell until i moved out, i do still love her because she’s my mom and im upset that she’s acting this way. i don’t think im in the wrong, but im scared that the way she is acting is going to permanently damage our relationship.
i took a nap after work today and had a dream (which i never have) where she was mad at me in the dream for moving in with kayla and locked me in a car with her and my siblings, while i had my dog in my lap. in the dream, i genuinely had to jump out of the car onto a freeway to get away from her and the rest of the dream was me hiding from her. i looked it up afterwards, and it said that jumping out of a car can means wanting to escape a situation in your life. i feel like it’s my subconscious telling me that if i want to be happy with kayla and in my life, i can’t be associated with my mom, which i don’t love.
my birthday is tomorrow, and my brother texted me saying my mom didn’t get me a gift because “i don’t do anything for her, so what’s the point?” and i’m upset that she’s not even going to text me happy birthday tomorrow. AITA? and would i potentially BTA if tomorrow she potentially doesn’t text me and i go no contact with her?",1,1761618195.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

1ohxu0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ohxu0d/the_what_if_trap_that_almost_drowned_me_how_i/,"The ""What If"" Trap That Almost Drowned Me – How I Broke Free After 8 Years","54M here again – yeah, the same guy who chased his ex into oblivion last time. If you caught that post, cool; if not, quick recap: 8 years down the drain with a quiet ""I need space"" that hit like a freight train. But chasing was just phase one. Phase two? The endless ""what if"" spiral that turned nights into torture sessions.

You know the drill: What if I'd said less that one fight? What if she saw how much I changed? What if her new thing crashes and she crawls back? I'd replay our best days like a bad rom-com on loop, convincing myself one more text could rewrite the ending. Spoiler from the guy who tried: It doesn't. It just carves deeper grooves in your brain, making every quiet moment a battlefield.

Rock bottom was month 2 – staring at the ceiling at 3 AM, heart racing like I'd run a marathon, wondering if I'd ever feel steady again. That's when I decided enough. No more mental reruns. Here's what yanked me out – raw, no BS, and it might for you too if those ""ifs"" are whispering (or screaming) right now.

Name the Beast: First, call it out loud. Grab a notebook (or voice memo if writing feels too much) and dump every ""what if."" Mine filled three pages: ""What if she was the one?"" ""What if I'm unlovable now?"" No editing – just purge. Then, next to each, slap a reality check: ""She chose out – that's her loss, not my flaw."" Sounds simple? It was the first crack in the wall. Did it for 10 mins a night; by week 3, the list shrank.

Swap the Script with Proof: Those thoughts thrive on fantasy, so starve 'em with facts. I started a ""win jar"" – scraps of paper with real stuff: ""Crushed that work project solo,"" ""Laughed hard at that dumb comedy special,"" ""Walked 5 miles without the ache."" Pull one out when the spiral hits. Pro tip: Add one daily, even tiny (brushed teeth? Counts). Turned my brain from critic to cheerleader over time.

Body Over Brain: Mind's a liar post-breakup, so boss it with sweat. I wasn't gym-rat material, but daily 20-min walks (podcast on, no phone doom-scroll) rewired the wiring. Science backs it – endorphins kick dopamine's ass for mood lifts. Bonus: Fresh air makes ""what ifs"" feel smaller, like problems for yesterday's you.

Borrow Eyes: Solo healing's tough; I looped in a therapist (online, low-key start) who called my ""ifs"" grief in disguise. Not magic, but hearing ""This is normal, and temporary"" from a pro? Gold. If therapy's not your jam yet, hit up a trusted buddy – ""Hey, mind if I bounce this loop off you?"" – turns echo chamber into echo of support.

Flash forward 7 months: She did ping me once (rebound blues, go figure), but the ""what if"" didn't own me anymore. I wished her well and kept walking – toward hikes with my dog, random coffee chats that spark joy, and yeah, feeling like the prize, not the consolation.

That trap? It's sneaky, but breakable. You're not stuck in hypotheticals; you're mid-plot twist to a better story. What's one ""what if"" that's got you tonight, and what's your first swing back at it? Drop it below – sharing lightens the load for all of us.

TL;DR: 54M shares how ""what if"" thoughts after 8-year breakup nearly broke him, but journaling realities, win-tracking, walks, and therapy flipped the script. You're not defined by the ifs – break free. Your story?

Grateful for this sub – one less spiral at a time.

P.S. If these stories hit home and you're craving more no-fluff tools for ditching the breakup brain fog, I've started spilling deeper dives on Medium. Real-talk pieces on rebuilding that magnetic vibe you lost sight of – think attraction signals that pull the right energy your way, not the ghosts.

1ohxsya,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1ohxsya/stitching_your_identity_why_custom_beanies_rule/,Stitching Your Identity: Why Custom Beanies Rule Winter Fashion,"There’s something incredibly comforting about pulling on a cozy beanie when the chill sets in. But what if your winter wear could do more than just keep you warm? That’s where custom beanies step in—blending comfort with character, style with self-expression. Whether you're trekking through snowy trails or grabbing coffee downtown, a custom beanie is a quiet nod to your individuality.

First off, let’s talk style. Mass-produced winter hats? They’re fine. But they rarely speak to who you are. Custom beanies, on the other hand, let you showcase your personality in ways big and small. You can choose colors that reflect your vibe, add quirky or meaningful designs, and even throw in a personal message or logo. It’s more than a hat—it’s a conversation starter.

Then there’s comfort. With custom options, you're not stuck with scratchy fabrics or awkward fits. You can choose the material that works best for your climate and your comfort level—whether that’s a chunky knit for serious warmth or a lighter ribbed style for crisp fall days. Plus, they’re made to fit *you*, not the average head. That means no more slipping, squeezing, or readjusting every five minutes.

Functionality also gets a major upgrade. Custom beanies can be designed with lifestyle in mind. Need extra insulation for skiing? Done. Prefer a fold-over cuff for a more secure fit? Easy. Want something breathable for running errands or hitting the gym? You’ve got it. When you’re the one calling the shots, you get exactly what you need—and nothing you don’t.

And let’s not forget the emotional impact. A beanie designed by you or gifted to someone else feels personal and thoughtful. It tells a story—of your creativity, your memories, or the people you care about. That kind of value can’t be bought off a shelf.

**Custom beanies** don’t just keep your head warm—they warm hearts, too. They’re a symbol of uniqueness in a season often blanketed in sameness. In a world full of fast fashion and fleeting trends, they give you the chance to slow down, choose quality, and wear something that’s unmistakably *you*. So this winter, don’t just blend in with the crowd. Stitch your identity into something that travels with you—wherever the cold takes you.",1,1761618019.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

My mom is really frugal and won’t replace things unless they’ve more or less turned to dust, so this christmas I wanted to surprise her with a machine that can brew her favourite teas, maybe coffee as well, and also boil water for her cooking and other needs. Does anyone have any good recommendations? I’m tight on money so cheap but good quality ones are appreciated! ",1,1761617972.0,Appliances,2,1.0,False
1ohxs4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1ohxs4t/quit_my_job_over_rat_infestation/,Quit my job over rat infestation,"I just quit my job at a coffee shop chain today because I couldn’t take the rats anymore. 

Do you think they were violating labor/ health and safety laws?

Last week I saw two live rats when working the closing shift alone and reported it to my bosses. They told me that they would call pest control to fix the issue. However, my coworkers and I continued to smell rat and find a few dead rats over the next couple of days. 

Today, I was working the closing shift again and the smell was worse than ever. The stench was coming from under the espresso bar, behind the fridges that are bolted to the ground. So all shift I was pushing through nausea while working, making coffees while breathing in rotting rat air. After a few hours the smell was getting to be too much so I went outside to get fresh air for a few minutes. I was light headed and at risk of vomiting on a customer. When I came back inside and walked behind the counter I saw a huge rat out in the open. The rat was so big it had its foot stuck in a glue trap and was just towing the thing behind it with no problem. I jumped in fear and the rat ran back behind the fridge to safety. 

I called the district manager and told him I needed help and that the conditions were making me uncomfortable to work. He told me he would come to my location to help. I continued to serve customers, stomping my feet with everything I did as to keep the rat from coming back out. After a hour, he showed up and this point I was shaking from anxiety and actively fighting the urge to puke. I asked if I could leave and he said no. I had tears in my eyes as I told him I couldn’t work under these conditions. My asthma was getting triggered and I was out of breath just from talking to him. He said he would watch the store while I went outside for air and that they would be sending people to move the fridge ‘soon’ (as in not today). He said they had nobody else to close and I could not leave. So I quit, leaving him there to deal with it. 

I actually liked working here until this point and don’t know if I am overreacting. I’m from nyc and I’m used to rats out in the city, but having them run by my feet while I serve food and beverages was just disgusting and scary. ",20,1761617948.0,AskNYC,13,0.83,False
1ohxrqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1ohxrqm/your_life_changed_when_you_relied_less_on/,"Your life changed when you relied less on motivation, and more on discipline: the real glow-up no one talks about","Let’s be honest. Most of us aren’t lazy, we’re just tired of chasing that elusive thing called “motivation.” You know, waiting around till you magically feel like going to the gym, writing that paper, fixing your resume, or cleaning your disaster of an apartment. And if your algorithm looks anything like mine, TikTok and IG are flooded with influencers yelling “Just manifest it!” or “If you wanted it bad enough, you’d do it.”  

That’s not just wrong. It’s dangerous.  

As someone who studied psychology and behavioral science at Harvard, I can confidently say this: motivation is a mood. Discipline is a system.  

We’ve been set up to believe that change and improvement require feeling inspired first. But the science says otherwise. In fact, the most successful people build their lives around systems, habits, and consistency, not fleeting emotion.  

Here’s the no BS guide that helped me and many others break the toxic motivation loop, and it’s all backed by real research, not just some dude in a hoodie screaming at his phone.

---

**Useful mindset shifts to break up with motivation addiction:**

- **Action creates emotion, not the other way around.** Behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg found in his Stanford research that “tiny habits” lead to long-term transformation. Waiting to feel inspired before taking action is backwards. Start small, then momentum builds motivation.

- **Discipline is a muscle, not a personality trait.** Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford) explains on his podcast that willpower is trainable. Cold exposure, delayed gratification, and specific routines literally rewire the prefrontal cortex, your brain's control center.

- **You don’t need to feel like it. You just need to do it.** That’s not toxic hustle culture. That’s how habits get automated. According to James Clear’s bestseller *Atomic Habits*, the key to long-term behavior change is identity-based habits. You act like the person you want to become, before you feel like them.

**Actual tools that make discipline easier (not harder):**

- **Use implementation intentions.** Instead of ""I’ll work out tomorrow,"" say: ""After I drink my morning coffee at 8am, I’ll do 20 minutes of bodyweight exercises."" This hack from Dr. Peter Gollwitzer’s psychology research boosts follow-through by up to 91%.

- **Habit stacking.** Pair a new habit with an existing one. Example: right after brushing teeth, do 2 minutes of journaling. It’s from *Atomic Habits* and helps anchor your routines.

- **Track streaks, not time.** Apps like Streaks, Finch, or even a calendar with red Xs (like Jerry Seinfeld used) reinforce consistency. You want to make breaking the streak feel harder than sticking to it.

- **Design friction.** Put your phone in another room before bed. Lay out gym clothes the night before. Environment > willpower. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely found that most decision-making is shaped by context, not intention.

**Best books that made me rethink everything about motivation and discipline:**

- **""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield**  
  This cult classic is short, punchy, and brutal. It slaps down every excuse you’ve ever had. Pressfield calls procrastination “Resistance” and treats it like a living enemy. It’s the best book I’ve ever read on creative discipline. You’ll finish it ready to destroy your inner laziness.

- **""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport**  
  A Wall Street Journal bestseller by a Georgetown professor. This book changed how I think about attention. Newport argues that focus is a rare and valuable skill most people have lost. He backs it with research and gives a full system for getting into flow. If you’ve ever felt foggy, distracted, or like your brain is fried, this is your reset button.

- **""Can’t Hurt Me"" by David Goggins**  
  Not your typical self-help read. Goggins is a former Navy SEAL who went from obese to elite athlete. He’s extreme, but the message is real: discipline builds a bulletproof mind. This book will make you uncomfortable in the best way possible. You’ll walk away feeling like you’ve been lied to about your limits.

**Free and low-lift apps that help you build discipline (and actually stick to it):**

- **BeFreed**  
  This one’s next level. It’s an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It takes books, podcasts, expert research, and real-world success stories and turns them into a podcast-style learning plan based on your interests. It’s perfect for people working on self-discipline, habit building, or mental strength. You even get to pick your host’s voice and mood, I picked a dry, sarcastic one that feels like a no-nonsense coach. It adapts to what you listen to and builds a learning plan over time. It also covers all the books I mentioned above in its massive audio library. Great if you want science-backed knowledge without doomscrolling for hours.

- **Insight Timer**  
  Guided meditations, focus music, and time tracking. It’s not just woo-woo stuff. They have meditations specifically for building consistency and reducing procrastination. Also great for winding down without screen time.

- **Finch**  
  This is for people who need a cute dopamine hit. It gamifies self-care with a digital pet that grows as you check off goals and routines. Surprisingly effective if you’re motivated by visuals and small wins.

---

**Podcasts and YouTubes that go way deeper than “just hustle harder”:**

- **The Huberman Lab Podcast**  
  Dr. Andrew Huberman shares neuroscience-backed tips for increasing motivation, managing dopamine, and rewiring habits. It’s long-form but worth it. His deep dive on discipline and goal setting is a must-listen.

- **Matt D’Avella on YouTube**  
  Minimalist filmmaker who explores discipline, habit change, and lifestyle design. It’s aesthetically soothing and packed with practical advice. Not preachy. Just honest.

- **The Tim Ferriss Show**  
  He interviews top performers from all industries and always drills into routines, systems, and discipline. Tons of gold here.

Discipline isn’t about being strict or joyless. It’s about doing what matters, especially when you don’t feel like it. You don’t need to wait for a wave of motivation to hit. You just need tools, habits, and systems that make doing the hard things easier.

Motivation is a spark. Discipline is the engine.
