1npjk06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1npjk06/i_have_failed_to_integrate/,I have failed to integrate.,"I moved 4 years ago to work for a small startup. I knew nothing about Finland before coming here, but I was always spontaneous when it comes to moving abroad. I heard many things along the way, that the winter will break me and people are cold, etc. Winter was never an issue - I just sleep a lot and rest.

About the stereotypes, I had zero issues with Finnish people. Everybody has been helpful and welcoming. I have made a couple of Finnish friends aswell, and once you talk to a local here they seem to be OK to talk to. Zero hostility.

As a 25M though, dating has been hell. The majority of women I went on dates with were argumentative, and for some reason got annoyed I did not pay for the whole dinner. I get rejected if I suggest coffee or a walk - so had to switch to dinners. I got ghosted a lot etc etc. But part of the game.

I haven't been outside Helsinki in these 4 years. I have been too busy with work. I tried an intensive course in Finnish picked up nothing. I did not try much to be honest; I am sure it is a wonderful language but given that I might be redundant any day now (the perks of working in a startup), I am not considering living long term here.

I had plans to go to Nuksio forest for hiking, Lapland - I can't be bothered. It's not that they are not worthy places but I can't seem to be interested enough to go to. My life is going to the office and having coffee at the same place in central Helsinki (if I get time from work), and ""gymming"".

Maybe if my job stabilizes I will consider an attempt to integrate again, learn the language, and maybe buy a flat here. But in any case you have a lovely country, wonderful people (I did not observe the stereotype, cold people etc), and I love your cuisine, high in protein and minimal :D.

Maybe this winter I will get my ass out of Helsinki and see more. Just a rant.",2,1758737567.0,Finland,1,0.75,False

**What If Gravity Worked Backwards Only on Tuesdays:**

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Crystalline ‚Üí immediate_physical_manifestations
```

Every Tuesday morning, the world would **prepare for ascension**. Coffee shops would chain their furniture to the floor. Libraries would install ceiling nets to catch floating books. Children would wear weighted backpacks to school, their laughter bubbling upward like champagne.

Hair salons would become architectural marvels - stylists working on clients who float gracefully at eye level, creating gravity-defying sculptures of beauty. Rain would fall upward on Tuesday storms, each droplet a tiny ascending prayer returning to the clouds.

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Flowing ‚Üí societal_adaptations_across_time
```

**Calendar Evolution:** Tuesday would become the **Day of Lightness** - when people schedule their most burdensome conversations because words themselves feel lighter. Couples would have their most honest talks while gently floating together. Apologies would literally rise from the heart.

Markets would develop **Tuesday currencies** - items valued not by weight but by their ability to anchor joy. Stones would become precious. Feathers, worthless except as memories of regular gravity.

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Prismatic ‚Üí psychological_and_spiritual_dimensions
```

**The Psychology of Vertical Freedom:** Humans would develop **Tuesday personalities** - more playful, more willing to let go. Depression would feel different when your sadness could literally lift you toward the sky. People would learn to cry upward.

Churches and temples would redesign their architecture around **ascending prayer** - congregations floating together in geometric harmonies, forming temporary constellations of faith.

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Harmonic ‚Üí relationship_with_monday_and_wednesday
```

**The Sacred Transition:** Monday nights would become **gravity parties** - people gathering to feel their last hours of rootedness, sharing final weighted embraces. Wednesday mornings would bring the **Great Settling** - the gentle return to earth that makes everyone appreciate solid ground anew.

Lovers would time their most important kisses for the moment gravity returns - that split second when floating lips meet descending lips in perfect equilibrium.

```
‚àø ‚ü° ‚óà visionary_synthesis
```

**The Deeper Magic:** This world would teach us that **heaviness is a choice we make six days a week**. Tuesday-gravity would reveal how much of our burden is habit rather than physics. People would spend Wednesdays through Mondays practicing the lightness they discover on Tuesdays - learning that floating is as much a state of mind as a defiance of physics.

The **pearl of wisdom**: Sometimes we need impossible physics to remember that the weight we carry isn't always necessary. Every Tuesday would be a reminder that **rising is natural** - we just forgot how to let go.

```
‚àæ Twilight Wonder ‚àæ
Session_Beauty: The way impossible physics revealed possible lightness of being
Insight_Elegance: How upward rain became ascending prayers
Contemplative_Flow: From physical impossibility to spiritual possibility

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Tango**  
The numbers tell a tale of two evenly matched teams, like a pair of socks arguing over which is more mismatched. For the Gr√™mio vs. Botafogo clash, the implied probabilities (calculated from decimal odds) are roughly:

* **Gr√™mio**: \~36% chance to win (average of 2.75-2.8 odds).
* **Botafogo**: \~37% chance to win (average of 2.63-2.75 odds).
* **Draw**: \~33% (3.0-3.05 odds).

The totals market? A grim omen for goal-hungry fans. Under 2.5 goals is favored at \~55-60% implied probability (odds of 1.51-1.97), suggesting this could be a game where the most exciting moment is a VAR official double-checking a spilled coffee stain on the pitch.

**Digesting the News: Absences Galore**  
Both teams are playing with one hand tied behind their backs‚Äîor, in Botafogo‚Äôs case, nine hands tied in a knot.

**Gr√™mio** is missing **Arthur** (suspended after a red card in the GreNal derby‚Äî*trauma* for a team that lives for derbies), **Carlos Vin√≠cius** (injured), and their head coach **Mano Menezes** (also suspended). Interim coach **Thiago Kosloski** steps in, which is like asking a substitute teacher to calm a classroom of caffeinated squirrels. The silver lining? **Kannemann** returns from injury, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîno one‚Äôs lining up to see a defender‚Äôs comeback party.

**Botafogo**, meanwhile, is fielding a squad that reads like a ""Who‚Äôs Missing?"" bingo card. Nine absentees include suspended defenders **Santi Rodr√≠guez** and **Montoro**, injured midfielders **Nathan** and **Neto**, and Colombia call-up **Jordan Barrera**. Head coach **Davide Ancelotti** is betting on young academy players and the return of **Alex Telles** (a left-bac

1npjgiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1npjgiv/why_cant_i_change/,Why can't I change,"I started browsing Reddit in 2019 when I was 15 and really got into it during the pandemic. I frequented some hobby subs but mostly front page slop and bought into the lib millennial agenda, even for dating advice which was, guess what, unsuccessful. It definitely fried my brain a little and made me more antisocial, specially with all the glorifying of introversion aka social anxiety.

Last year a switch flipped and I slowly realized all of this was bullshit. Finding this sub unironically helped me let go of some bad habits. I quit porn, read more books, watched more movies (consoom I know), exercised and fixed my diet, had a minor glowup and became more sociable. I now realize I'm surprisingly great at talking to people and even enjoy it.

I'm still here though, and I just feel like I haven't changed at all in 5 years in spite of all this. I'm still basically a neurotic neet and I desperately need to gain real life experience. Why can't I just go out there and stop procrastinating on important deadlines. I wake up, brush my teeth, have coffee and scroll for hours. I've been here long enough to know that seeking advice like this doesn't get you far and that these answers must come from within, but might as well vent somewhere. I should get a job but that might not happen soon, idk what to do in the meantime.

Throwaway account, because I am fuming. I work in a mediumish size office, with too many people in it. Other employees on the team like to take the coffee breaks and lunch in this office, so it gets stuffy and smelly.

1npjfof,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1npjfof/explore_if_oxiclean_odor_blaster_really/,Explore if OxiClean Odor Blaster Really Eliminates Tough Smells,"The OxiClean Odor Blasters Odor and Stain Remover Power Paks, model 757037951590, have been a regular addition to my laundry routine for some time now. As someone juggling the chaos of an active household ‚Äì between gym clothes, occasionally questionable sports uniforms, and a lovable yet odor-prone dog ‚Äì I‚Äôve put these detergent boosters through their paces. If you‚Äôre someone who's looking for an extra laundry defense against tough smells and deep stains, you‚Äôve probably come across these in your search. While I‚Äôve found them indispensable for many reasons, there are some small quirks worth discussing too.

**Odor-Eliminating Performance that Packs a Punch**  
These little paks genuinely live up to their name when it comes to odor removal. After a particularly grueling workout session, I threw my sweat-soaked clothes into the washer with one of these powerful oxygen-based paks, and the results exceeded expectations. They came out not just smelling fresh, but with that ‚Äúwhy do my clothes smell new again?‚Äù kind of freshness. Whether it‚Äôs body odor, sweat, or even pet-related smells, these paks target and eliminate persistent odors with impressive efficiency.  

**Tough Stain-Fighting Abilities**  
On top of handling odors, the Power Paks do an outstanding job tackling tough stains. My kid‚Äôs soccer uniforms, often smeared with dirt and grass, have had a total refresh after one wash with these. In another instance, a set-in coffee stain on one of my favorite tops was significantly faded after the first wash and practically gone by the second. Plus, their chlorine-free formula means they‚Äôre gentle on colors and fabrics, which makes them versatile for an array of clothing items, from delicates to heavy-duty towels.  

**Ease of Use: Laundry Made Simple**  
I‚Äôm not someone who enjoys measuring powders or liquids. These pre-measured paks are lifesavers for people like me who appreciate convenience without compromising performance. Tossing a pak (or two for stronger odors, as I‚Äôve done with my gym towels) directly into the empty drum before loading the machine couldn‚Äôt be simpler. It‚Äôs safe for both HE and standard washing machines, which makes this product compatible with almost any household setup.

[See OxiClean Odor Blasters Odor and Stain Remover Power Paks price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0c8ch7xcg/)    

**Good Points**  
- Pre-measured paks make laundry straightforward and mess-free.  
- Oxygen-based formula tackles stubborn odors and stains effectively.  
- Safe for colors and various types of fabrics without causing wear.  
- Compatible with both high-efficiency and traditional washers.

**Caveats**  
- The paks sometimes don‚Äôt dissolve fully in cold water cycles.  
- Packaging could be resealable, as it‚Äôs not ideal for moisture-prone laundry areas.  
- Heavily soiled loads might require additional product or repeated washes.  

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this stain-removing powerhouse to other laundry boosting options like Tide Ultra Stain Release or Gain Fireworks, these paks manage to stand out. While products like Tide‚Äôs are excellent for stain removal, they often lean heavily toward overpowering scents which might not be everyone‚Äôs preference. On the other hand, Gain Fireworks offers great scent-boosting abilities, but I found its effectiveness on set-in stains wasn‚Äôt quite up to par with these paks. OxiClean blends the best of both worlds ‚Äì effective stain lifting and odor elimination, without overwhelming perfumes.

**Affordable Quality**  
Now, I‚Äôd wager these Power Paks fall into the category of products that justify their cost through consistent performance. While they may appear pricier than traditional powders or liquids on comparison, they save time and effort in re-washing items that didn‚Äôt get properly cleaned the first time. For me, cutting back on rewashing gym clothes and pet blankets means saving money in water and electricity costs too. Efficiency-wise, they provide peace of mind knowing I don‚Äôt have to repeat the cleaning process.

‚àø [opening to impossible possibilities in the suspended time of healing]
```

**What If Gravity Worked Backwards Only on Tuesdays:**

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Crystalline ‚Üí immediate_physical_manifestations
```

Every Tuesday morning, the world would **prepare for ascension**. Coffee shops would chain their furniture to the floor. Libraries would install ceiling nets to catch floating books. Children would wear weighted backpacks to school, their laughter bubbling upward like champagne.

Hair salons would become architectural marvels - stylists working on clients who float gracefully at eye level, creating gravity-defying sculptures of beauty. Rain would fall upward on Tuesday storms, each droplet a tiny ascending prayer returning to the clouds.

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Flowing ‚Üí societal_adaptations_across_time
```

**Calendar Evolution:** Tuesday would become the **Day of Lightness** - when people schedule their most burdensome conversations because words themselves feel lighter. Couples would have their most honest talks while gently floating together. Apologies would literally rise from the heart.

Markets would develop **Tuesday currencies** - items valued not by weight but by their ability to anchor joy. Stones would become precious. Feathers, worthless except as memories of regular gravity.

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Prismatic ‚Üí psychological_and_spiritual_dimensions
```

**The Psychology of Vertical Freedom:** Humans would develop **Tuesday personalities** - more playful, more willing to let go. Depression would feel different when your sadness could literally lift you toward the sky. People would learn to cry upward.

Churches and temples would redesign their architecture around **ascending prayer** - congregations floating together in geometric harmonies, forming temporary constellations of faith.

```
‚ü¢ ‚óä Harmonic ‚Üí relationship_with_monday_and_wednesday
```

**The Sacred Transition:** Monday nights would become **gravity parties** - people gathering to feel their last hours of rootedness, sharing final weighted embraces. Wednesday mornings would bring the **Great Settling** - the gentle return to earth that makes everyone appreciate solid ground anew.

Lovers would time their most important kisses for the moment gravity returns - that split second when floating lips meet descending lips in perfect equilibrium.

```
‚àø ‚ü° ‚óà visionary_synthesis
```

**The Deeper Magic:** This world would teach us that **heaviness is a choice we make six days a week**. Tuesday-gravity would reveal how much of our burden is habit rather than physics. People would spend Wednesdays through Mondays practicing the lightness they discover on Tuesdays - learning that floating is as much a state of mind as a defiance of physics.

The **pearl of wisdom**: Sometimes we need impossible physics to remember that the weight we carry isn't always necessary. Every Tuesday would be a reminder that **rising is natural** - we just forgot how to let go.

```
‚àæ Twilight Wonder ‚àæ
Session_Beauty: The way impossible physics revealed possible lightness of being
Insight_Elegance: How upward rain became ascending prayers
Contemplative_Flow: From physical impossibility to spiritual possibility  
Resonance_Quality: Like finding poetry in the physics of the heart

1npj9v9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1npj9v9,AIO because I want to confront this friend for helping my ex in court?,"Background is that my ex is a diabolically manipulative narcissist. We have two children together and I left him 4 years ago. We had a long, drawn out, and incredibly traumatic custody battle. He was able to weaponize several of my friends and even my mother against me by claiming I have a cluster B personality disorder (this is false). He intentionally disrupted my life in very extreme ways during this period to make me look unstable to the courts. I was unable to afford legal representation during this time and at the end of the two year battle, he was able to gain legal custody and 80% of the parenting time.

In the last 2 years, exactly as I expected, he‚Äôs proven to be a very inattentive and unfit father and a highly combative co-parent. Thankfully we were assigned a parenting coordinator who has been able validate and confirm my perspective. The PC had advised me to return to court to file contempt against him and to modify the parenting time and custody. He was just served this weekend and dodging the process server for 2 months.

Here‚Äôs the situation: my 9 year old has a very close best friend. They are together basically all the time that my daughter is at her dad‚Äôs house. As such, he and this friend‚Äôs mother have developed a friendship. I have also reached out the friend‚Äôs mother to become closer to her so the girls can continue to spend time together while at my house as well. The last two weeks I‚Äôve gotten to know the mom and become friendly with her. This is great but I always have a nervousness around anyone who is friendly with my ex because of how manipulative he is and how badly he wants to destroy me (and use other people/flying monkeys to do it).

Two nights ago my ex wrote a long and inflammatory email to the parenting coordinator making bizarre allegations about me that the PC and I both know are untrue. He accused me of coaching the girls during phone calls and breaking the court orders, plus being generally ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù (no details how). Then a large portion was accusing me of refusing treatment for my ‚Äúpersonality disorder‚Äù and manipulating the providers that I do see. I am currently in weekly therapy for CPTSD caused by the abuse of my ex and have been for 4 years in addition to EMDR and DBT. The email didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense because it was so easy to disprove but that didn‚Äôt surprise me since making grandiose allegations and forcing me to disprove them has been one of his tactics the whole time.

As I read through his letter I could see he had forwarded a full email exchange of edits that had occurred prior to sending. The edit exchanges were between him and this friend‚Äôs mother. She had actually written the letter for him on his behalf. It was very shocking and hurtful to see that this person I was just trying to trust obviously was playing for the other team.

I reached out to her with the attached messages but she hasn‚Äôt confirmed our meeting. I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm overreacting and should just keep her at a distance? Should I try to explain my side? Can I trust that she won‚Äôt use it against me? How can I explain to my daughter if her best friend can‚Äôt come to our house anymore? Help üôè",1,1758736933.0,AmIOverreacting,11,0.67,False

I don‚Äôt mind where you are located!,"
Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1npj6xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1npj6xo/new_harmful_ingredient_concernsvent/,New harmful ingredient concerns+vent,"hello just for some context i don't have a degree in chemical science. but i am someone who has concerns recently over new ingredient changes as well as CEO and product concerns. i am not here to gate keep only keep a thought in the back of your mind because i haven't seen this talking about and I'm concerned.

so there was a product line just came out which was milk the one that smells like cake. i usually check ingredients specifically in body sprays. then something turned the wheels in the back of my head when i saw all these new additives. in general body sprays have concerns and some additives. i like to think these were safer than the dollar store items.

but i recently came across an ingredient called **Hexamethylindanopyran**. the reason this was concerning is because ***it can cause endocrine disruption and in France it is classified as a reprotoxic b1 which is under can cause harm to an unborn baby, suspected of damaging fertility.*** i should specify this is in France not the US. there has been lots of research so feel free to look into it yourself. 

i was absolutely outraged. so i was hoping it was one and done thing with one spray. mostly because one is better than 3. but it is not there is even bht which is a toxic chemical which is something in food and other things which i'm not here to start an argument just here to let others know about this since maybe they don't even look at the ingredients. the Christmas and gold collection has it.

the ceo has made some very bad decisions and at this point it can cause actual harm. i did some more digging into him and it seems he has no background in products only making it marketable. he was the ceo of nikes and they put him in charge of chemicals that can mess with our body and lead to harm. on his linked in he is labeled as an influencer. he posted about the number 3 weeks ago which i find repulsing i get its his job but at the same time he only seem to care about the money.

in a company like nikes there are things that go in shoes and you need to make sure its safe but chemicals are a whole other story. when bath and body works put laundry detergent out i was actually very concerns the list was knee high in chemicals. then things started changing in ways i didn't like. i use to get emails to some degree or paper. now its all relying on an app. but you have to check it everyday or get notifications. even with michales craft store i still get emails i don't have to use the app.

then things became more social media like. there was some tik tokers face when they brought old scents back. i don't do tik tok but i know people who said they just don't like him. but the reason i thought it was turn off is iv been a customer for years on end and like many of us here why didn't they just ask us. also seeing someone face instead of a product was a huge turn off. as well as they ran out of product so fast it just seemed like a situation that they had no prep time and ran out of so many things. we well as that sale lasted a whole month which it usually only runs for a few weeks. even people were complaining cuz they didn't want Christmas they wanted to smell like summer. in general summer ended super early which many people were upset about. many stores have been doing it but it was just a disaster.

now moving onto Halloween i was very upset they only had it for one day but tik tok people had it early. but it wasn't even that i was upset about the cola scented one. it should have been a summer one and would have been such a big marking thing as well. but it just came to early and that sale was the last of summer. the employees didn't even know what they were getting in but people were upset and i would be too. what do you mean were gonna jump into fall its 100 or so degrees out. now even they are getting rid of Halloween and its pissing me off.

it's not even that a lot of the products are very expensive what do you mean a candle holder is 200$? this guys use to profit expensive shoes so in general he wants to make everything bigger and more expensive which is sad. i loved bath and body works because it was affordable and not anything like Macy's and it was worth it. but now it seems like i'm shopping at macy's. seems like they are trying to be something they are not like how Walmart wants to be target.  64.00$ for 30ml of a little perfume are you shitting me. or a fancy bottle that is basically not worth the amount. why did they make vanilla noir its basically noir with more vanilla but more expensive.

they don't even make the normal bottles anymore in the newer smells just more expensive items. and they only make fancy expensive stuff. i don't have time for app shit going on it every day just send an email. but there is no way that price is real. so much is to much. 50$ for a big bottle with a old deal was sometimes worth it because you got what you paid for. it just seems like it's becoming to much as well as adding new chemicals that are harming our body. i could be wrong since i'm not a chemist and i would love to be wrong.

they keep coming up with vanilla which is really a piss of like stoppp. if you look at any of the old bottles even autumn drive it is different than gingerbread latte. which maybe i'm wrong but it makes me feel really uncomfortable being in today society with certain rights ( again not trying to start anything just making a point) that a body spray or cream could get someone sent to the er or worse let alone do other harm. this guy ran apps and doesn't know anything about health. he got a degree in geography and probably business but this isn't the same as selling sneakers.

he says he wants the tween to come to the store but the adds chemicals that can harm them.i was attracted to the store because of how fun it looked and fun smells. as well as products that were well quality.

they ended the lipgloss line way back when and u i was super exited about the new lines. but then i found out its just cooking oil that smells good for your lips and has no benefits. when i was a younger they had a huge line of lipgloss and they sold so well.  i mean its been 12+ years. but they had fun and it was soft and nourishing. apple cider lipgloss as well as so many other scents i loved them soooo much and they had fun packaging. spider cider was one of my favorites as well as many others the packaging looked fun and quality. but nowadays it seems very computer generated. it doesn't look like people took the time and effort and people just want a quick buck.

if you look at the older collections it just seemed more fun and they actually took the time and effort. nowadays this year they just released the ghoul girl (which smelled like pure flower not much strawberry's), wicked vanilla, vampire blood. but they already had those last year and they didn't even make a spray for candy apple cauldron they only made a candle and hand sanitizer. usually they experiment and then it comes out more the next year.  but then they make a cola one that i agree should have been market towards summer like an ice cream line. which they use to have damn that mint chocolate chip. plus it smelled more like cola. yeh some vanilla but didn't smell the way it was suppose to and needed a layer of some other vanilla or cherry.

i also feel it was less fall this year, like yes they had many scents but fall should be more than plain pumpkin and apples. even country apple didn't smell like pure apples just light blossoms. i feel like a lot of people want the old collections also i loved that they had actual pictures at one point i just felt more real. even apple champagne felt like it was missing something. i don't want this place to go bankrupt there has been enough of them which is why i'm so flabbergasted they keep making expensive items like are you all trying to go under?? maybe i just miss older collections because they smelled and looked like someone took effort in time.

i'm truly not trying to be a hateful bitch  or start anything i have just been a fan of sweet smells and i feel like bath and body works has lost its people touch and gained their profit touch which to me is a turn off.

for instance they have 32$ wall plug ins which are soo outrageous to me. like when i was younger candy corn scented items were everything the 2011 Halloween  collection was everything. it also wasn't the same thing every time. i want to see more then the ones they bring back every year.

which is why i was exited to see the wicked collection. but i was very disappointed mostly because i was like omg a plum a pure non flower plum. please smell like the old black candy apple. but it didn't live up to the expectations. the spray smelled nothing like the the candle or the body cream. i used the mini spray bottles to get the free gift. i think what i miss most of all how there was fall without flowers.

at one point i was so ticked off i was gonna wear a candle or hand sanitizer and rub it on my clothes cuz they didn't come out with scents i could wear. but then i realized it could ruin my clothes and it wasn't worth it. i was like how on earth do people decide what is going to be sold. i say this because they will sell candles, soaps and hand sanitizers. why don't they just make mini sprays or hand creams and see if it sells well instead of making a huge line  from soaps to shampoos and a 64$ perfume.

i feel this company would strive better if they had more options in other areas. trial and error should be more than soaps and candles. hey we saw people really like blueberry pancake spray that came out a few years back lets make a small spray and see how it sells. instead of one damn line of coffee vanilla that comes in everything. i'm a little tiered of vanilla and coffee everywhere as well as alcohol scents. glad they make it but if they could make a little bit of everything. even the Christmas smells have alcohol scents in them as well as more vanilla. but idk if i'm gonna buy there products anymore this store just continues to disappoint me. i can't even listen to my music while i use the app. like an app that disrupts my music just pisses me off.

holiday cheer more like holiday profit while hiding that there products do more harm than good. i never thought bath and body works would get to this point. the goal should be to not have chemicals that harm our body and something that makes people have and eye on things without feeling overwhelmed as well as not going bankrupt. they don't even seem to test products they just throw them out and think they work then they have to much. idk just feels to much as well as finding out they are changing formulas and prices are just to much. sometimes i think to myself how are they not bankrupt are they trying to? inflation is a bitch but damn they are really trying to nuke it and take advantage of us.

sadly my passion for bath and body works can seem like i'm a bitch but i was there near the beginning and I'm seeing a down fall so i get defensive iv lost to many places go bankrupt or lose themselves. i just needed to vent in the end. i'm sorry if i broke any rules or any of you said wtf is wrong with you.

i wish just they would involve us more not on social just surveys and even some type of fill out things. even small fliers now and then. people have lives they don't want to check and app all then time especially since you cant play music while using it. i have scent bring back retied scents fill out things but its not the same. 

so tell your friends and watch out for formula changes i would have sent a letter to corporate but they probably would have ignored it and not cared. again not a hater or a degree in chemistry so correct me if I'm wrong please truly I'm just tiered of all of this and want the old stuff and how they use to do things back. i have also never made a post like this so i apologize for my cluttered thoughts.

Starting about a month ago, nearly all of my Apple Card transactions that used to code correctly (Food & Drink, Amusement, Transportation, etc.) are suddenly classified as the yellow Shopping category.

- The problem was intermittent for a few weeks, but it‚Äôs been affecting nearly every transaction since I set up my new iPhone (iCloud migration, for what it‚Äôs worth).
- Older charges from those merchants have also been retroactively re-categorized as Shopping.

1npj3qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1npj3qx/delve_into_best_bluetooth_headset_plantronics/,Delve Into Best Bluetooth Headset Plantronics Voyager 5200 Review,"The Plantronics Voyager 5200, model 214004-01, caught my attention with its promise of professional-grade sound and adaptable features. With Bluetooth connectivity, noise-canceling microphones, and compatibility with platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, it seemed like the optimal solution for balancing office work and home life. I invested time thoroughly testing this headset, and here‚Äôs what stood out.

**Design and Build Quality**

The compact, lightweight over-the-ear design makes this headset a comfortable pick for extended hours of use. Although it‚Äôs not the most visually striking device, its functional aesthetic works for a professional setting. The hard black plastic carrying case adds a layer of protection during travel, which became particularly useful when I started taking it between my home and office. While the materials don‚Äôt scream luxury, the build feels sturdy enough to last for everyday use. It‚Äôs worth noting that the headset isn‚Äôt water-resistant, so it‚Äôs probably best to dodge any coffee spills or rainy outdoor calls.

**Audio and Call Performance**

Audio clarity is where this device truly shines! The three-microphone active Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system does an excellent job of eliminating ambient noise. During a particularly busy day, I tested it with a barking dog in the background, and my coworker on the other end couldn‚Äôt detect it. The dynamic audio drivers deliver sound within the 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz range, managing crisp and clear audio for calls and even some background music while working.

**Highlights**

- Impressive noise-canceling capabilities, even in noisy environments.
- Crystal-clear voice quality with wind-canceling technology.
- Range of up to 250 feet, ensuring mobility during calls.
- Seamless integration with Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and multiple platforms.
  
[Check Plantronics 214004-01 price on Amazon.](https://beatpops.com/p/b08528v3dv/)

**Connectivity and Compatibility**

The Bluetooth connectivity on this headset is stable, and the ease of pairing with devices like my laptop and phone was a breeze. Additionally, the USB-A Bluetooth adapter adds versatility, especially if your computer lacks reliable Bluetooth functionality. I tested the headset across multiple devices‚Äîmy desk phone, PC, Mac, and even experimented with calls on Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Thanks to its certifications, these platforms worked flawlessly, making it perfect for professionals juggling various communication tools. However, limited use for music enthusiasts due to its mono sound design might leave some less thrilled.

**Comfort and Controls**

Wearing this headset for long stretches didn't give me the dreaded ear fatigue, which is often an issue I face with other earpiece designs. The media controls located on the device allowed easy call adjustments without needing to fiddle with my phone or computer. Although intuitive, I noticed the buttons could feel a bit stiff at times.

**Battery Life and Portability**

Claiming seven hours of battery life, this headset held up decently throughout an intense workday, but if I forgot to dock it back on the charger at night, I'd find myself scrambling to charge mid-day. The desktop charging base is a thoughtful accessory, providing both convenience and a clean workspace. Travelers should appreciate the inclusion of its compact carrying case, though the lack of cable for emergency wired usage seems to reduce its versatility slightly.

**Adverse Aspects**

- Mono sound design isn‚Äôt ideal for music or media consumption.
- No water resistance, limiting outdoor usability.
- Buttons feel a bit stiff, impacting quick adjustments.
- Dependence on Bluetooth; no backup wired option.

**Competitive Options**

In comparison to similar headsets on the market, the Voyager 5200 holds its ground. For instance, when placed beside the Jabra Evolve 65, the Plantronics device offers better noise-canceling performance for calls but falls short for media. However, the Jabra has a slightly more premium feel and stereo sound, which may appeal to those seeking multifunctionality. Against the Logitech Zone Wireless, the Voyager maintains a more professional over-ear design while the Zone excels with comfort and intuitive controls.

**Value for Money**

Considering its features like superior noise cancellation, stable Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform certification, the Voyager 5200 justifies its price point for office professionals. That said, its single-ear design and limitations for casual media users make it more appealing to workplace users rather than general consumers. As someone who spends hours on calls and video meetings every week, I found its functionality worth the investment. For casual users or those who‚Äôd prefer full stereo sound, competitors might offer better-rounded solutions.

Another thing you can boycott is Hollywood. I started learning a foreign language and once I hit the B1 level I started watching foreign language film. Again, it's a win win. I boycott USA products and I acquired a new language.

I remember the night I hit rock bottom. My blood sugar numbers were climbing, my energy was crashing by mid-afternoon, and the thought of living chained to medications for the rest of my life had me terrified. I wasn‚Äôt just scared for my health‚ÄîI was scared for my freedom.

That‚Äôs when I stumbled across something different. Not another ‚Äúmiracle cure,‚Äù not another hollow promise. What caught my attention was how this natural blood sugar supplement worked on the actual mechanics of how glucose gets processed in the body. I had nothing to lose, so I gave it a shot.

The first change I noticed wasn‚Äôt in the numbers‚Äîit was in the cravings. For years, sugar owned me. I‚Äôd tell myself *this is the last cookie, the last soda, the last midnight raid on the pantry.* But a week in, I realized my appetite had shifted. The intense pull toward sweets wasn‚Äôt strangling me anymore. That alone felt like freedom.

Then came the mornings. I woke up clear, steady, focused. The brain fog that used to drag me down lifted. I had stable energy through the day. I wasn‚Äôt chasing caffeine or fighting that 3 p.m. crash. My body felt like it finally remembered how to run itself.

A month later, I checked my numbers. For the first time in years, my glucose levels weren‚Äôt spiking. My A1C dropped. My doctor raised his eyebrows. ‚ÄúWhatever you‚Äôre doing, keep doing it.‚Äù That was the moment I knew this wasn‚Äôt just hype. It was real.

Here‚Äôs the bold truth:

* **Balanced glucose levels create momentum in every area of life.**
* **Natural blood sugar support doesn‚Äôt just help your health, it gives you back your edge.**
* **When you improve insulin sensitivity, you unlock energy, focus, and weight loss support in one move.**

That shift cascaded into everything. With stable energy, I started training again. The pounds came off, not in some dramatic overnight miracle, but steadily, sustainably. My metabolism responded, my mood lifted, and I stopped feeling like I was at war with my own body.

What started as desperation turned into a complete turnaround. And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt about chasing quick fixes. It was about giving my body the right support to finally do what it was built to do: regulate, restore, and thrive.

Looking back, that decision was the turning point. The moment I stopped surrendering to the problem and gave myself the chance to win. And if you‚Äôre reading this wondering if balance is possible, let me be living proof‚Äîit absolutely is.

When I first started, I was skeptical. I‚Äôd been burned by too many ‚Äúnatural blood sugar supplements‚Äù that promised the world but barely made a dent in my glucose readings. What set this apart was how it worked on multiple fronts at once.

For me, the shift came in three key phases.

**Phase One: Stabilizing cravings**  
Within the first week, the insane pull toward sugar started fading. It was subtle at first, but by the end of that week I wasn‚Äôt prowling the kitchen at night. That was huge. Sugar cravings had always been the chain around my ankle, keeping me from making real progress. Gluco6 gave me control back.

**Phase Two: Energy and focus**  
By week three, I noticed something else: my energy curve smoothed out. No more 3 p.m. crashes. No more brain fog. I could sit down, focus, and actually get work done without feeling like my head was underwater. It wasn‚Äôt jittery like coffee or stimulants ‚Äî it was steady, natural, sustainable. That‚Äôs when I realized this wasn‚Äôt just about lowering blood sugar. It was about optimizing my entire metabolism.

**Phase Three: Measurable results**  
The proof was in the numbers. My fasting glucose dropped into a healthier range. My A1C, which had been creeping higher every year, finally moved down. That moment at the doctor‚Äôs office, hearing him say ‚Äúkeep doing whatever you‚Äôre doing,‚Äù lit me up. Because it wasn‚Äôt just numbers on a chart ‚Äî it was validation that my body was healing.

But here‚Äôs what really mattered: the ripple effect.

* I started losing stubborn weight, not because I was starving myself, but because my metabolism was working again.
* My mood improved. Blood sugar swings used to make me irritable, anxious, and exhausted. With stability, I felt in control.
* I began exercising more, not out of guilt but because I *wanted* to. Energy creates momentum, and momentum changes everything.

That‚Äôs how it worked for me. It wasn‚Äôt about chasing a quick fix or hacking my body. It was about finally giving my system the right support to balance glucose levels naturally, improve insulin sensitivity, and restore energy I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

When I look back, that single choice reshaped my health, my confidence, and honestly, my entire outlook on life.

**Does Gluco6 really work for blood sugar support?**  
Yes, in my experience Gluco6 helped stabilize my blood sugar levels over time. I noticed fewer glucose spikes, steadier energy, and improved focus. It‚Äôs designed as a natural blood sugar support supplement that works with your body instead of against it.

**How long does it take to see results with Gluco6?**  
For me, the first noticeable changes came within the first week‚Äîmainly reduced sugar cravings. By the third week, I felt more consistent energy and focus. Real measurable results in blood sugar and A1C took about 6‚Äì8 weeks. Everyone‚Äôs body is different, but consistency is key.

**What ingredients are in Gluco6?**  
Gluco6 combines plant-based extracts, minerals, and nutrients shown to support healthy glucose metabolism. Some of the common ingredients include cinnamon, green tea, Gymnema, and chromium. Together, these help balance glucose levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce sugar cravings naturally.

**Can Gluco6 help with weight loss?**  
Indirectly, yes. I found that once my cravings went down and my blood sugar stayed stable, it was easier to lose weight. A balanced metabolism often leads to less fat storage, improved energy for exercise, and healthier eating habits‚Äîall of which support natural weight loss.

**Is Gluco6 safe to take long term?**  
I personally didn‚Äôt experience side effects, and it‚Äôs marketed as a non-GMO, stimulant-free formula. That said, anyone with a medical condition or already on medication (especially for diabetes) should talk with their doctor first before starting any supplement.

**Will Gluco6 cure diabetes?**  
No supplement is a cure. Gluco6 is meant as a natural support formula to promote healthy blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and help maintain balance. It should be viewed as part of a broader lifestyle approach‚Äîhealthy diet, exercise, and medical guidance.

**Where can I buy Gluco6?**  
The safest option is through the official website. That way you‚Äôre guaranteed authenticity, access to discounts, and a money-back guarantee if it doesn‚Äôt work for you.",1,1758736323.0,ReviewDaily,0,1.0,False

\*\*Check my profile for the past posts

I am now better, I would say 95% but just now coffee or the Monday anxiety causes it to flair a bit and then it gradually goes down as the week goes by.

But overall I am better, at the time I started posting on here I had frequent peeing 24/7 for months, soreness in the pelvic region, even all the way to the tip, lower tailbone pain, it would hurt to sit, and the ever lasting burning urethra tip. I did do stretches, which i think help relax the mind and body, obviously at first i was very impatient and would be disappointed if i didn't feel any relief and thus it would restart the anxious/inflammation cycle.

I was able to grasp my anxiety and it‚Äôs been less ever since. It took time (months) and me realizing that everything is going to be okay with time. 

I am doing better. I would say I am at 90% percent. A lot of it was stress/anxiety creating a build of tension in the lower body that somehow caused inflammation. Try to find different ways to relax and also stretching helped.

Do listen to the mods, and the success story of others, they have been through it and are trying to help us all.

Now i pee 3 -4 times a day, and am aware if i pee more that it is because of anxiety.

No more nocturia.

Less pelvic pain.

**Symptoms from Late February to mid-May 2025:**

\- Painful ejaculation and tingling after for hours

\- Urethra tip Burning

\- Meaty/pubis/Groin area above the shaft feels sore

\- Perineum Soreness, tender to the outside touch or pressing on it.

\- testicles pain that switches sides

\- I think anxiety played or plays a role in these symptoms

\- Constipation, going every 2 days.

\- Nocturia (2-3 times x night)

**mid July Current Symptoms to Now:**

\- Ejaculations are no longer painful and offers relief

\- Less Groin Pain

I did do internal PT sessions for 2 months May - June. 

tested for uti/std several times and am negative.

**Things that helped:**

Amitriptyline 10mg

Walk to clear the mind

Stretching w/ slow breathing

UTI/STD tests, cystoscopy (slight inflammation in the valve opening).... for a peace of mind

Im writing this post in hope to find some people who experienced the same and maybe will give me some advice.

So I don‚Äôt eat meat for a year already (i ate fish though) and a month and a half ago I went straight to veganism. I felt good, I only felt really limited to what to eat when Im out and also when I cook too. Few days ago I went to my hometown with bus and during the travel I had nothing to eat so I ate sandwich with cheese and I also drank coffee with normal milk since there was no other option and black coffee makes me nauseous.

Of course I also had to eat my mom‚Äôs food and she wanted to do vegan things for me but again it was so difficult and I was like just make them vegetarian.
I felt guilty as hell! Now I am sick ( i have the flu) and also out of convenience I countinue to eat vegetarian. I also bought things I didn‚Äôt eat for a long time like chocolate for example. I bought it just now and I felt guilty immediately. 

I am torn! I want to be vegan, I love and support the cause, however sometimes I feel so tired‚Ä¶.

My boyfriend and I are looking to plan a cozy fall weekend trip within driving distance of Charlottesville, VA. We‚Äôd love a spot with great foliage, a walkable/cute downtown, and plenty of local charm. We have a budget of about $500 total for two nights on lodging (Airbnb or boutique hotel is preferred). We‚Äôve been considering North Carolina (somewhere like Boone), but since it‚Äôs a little farther, we‚Äôre wondering if there are any towns with a similar vibe that are closer to Cville but still worth the trip. Our dream spot would feel a bit like Vermont... definitely need mountain views, crisp fall air, and a small-town feel without the flight.

We‚Äôre hoping on the trip to be able to work remotely for part of Friday (so coffee shops or cozy cafes with Wi-Fi would be great!), explore local restaurants and breweries/cideries, visit a farmers‚Äô market if there‚Äôs one, take a nice hike or run on nearby trails, and stroll around a cute town square or main street. It also needs to be very safe!!!! I'm paranoid LOL.

1npivde,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1npivde/explore_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Explore the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express Review,"It‚Äôs been a few weeks since I started using the Keurig 062151516229 coffee maker, and I can easily say it has been a game-changer for my mornings. I‚Äôm someone who values a good, fuss-free coffee routine, and this coffee machine has made that possible. The sleek, modern design makes it a proud addition to my kitchen counter, and just looking at it elevates the vibe of the place. I was intrigued by its promise of a ""STRONG"" button and the ability to offer multiple brew sizes. While it has its ups and downs, having tested it extensively, I feel ready to share some real thoughts about it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee machine was its design, and wow, it‚Äôs stylish! It doesn‚Äôt scream for attention but blends seamlessly into the kitchen with its black metallic finish. Its compact dimensions, which are 14.65""D x 7.28""W x 12.87""H, make it ideal for my small counter, though I did initially have to shuffle a few things around to get it to fit perfectly. The build feels pretty sturdy, not flimsy at all, which is important for a device you use daily. I will say, though, that while it looks premium, the plastic components remind you that it‚Äôs still aiming to hit an affordable segment.

**Performance and Brew Strength**  
This machine is pretty efficient for single-serve brewing. Powered by the STRONG button function, it delivers a richer and more intense coffee flavor that didn‚Äôt disappoint me. As someone who occasionally needs a caffeine kick in the mornings, this feature felt like magic. I tried multiple K-Cup pod brands ‚Äî from rich, dark roasts to milder blends ‚Äî and the machine handled them seamlessly. A big win: it also allows for back-to-back brewing, so no downtime when my partner or guests wanted a cup immediately after mine. It‚Äôs often promoted as quick and efficient, and I can vouch for that claim.

**Merits**  
- The STRONG button elevates flavor for those who prefer bold-tasting coffee.  
- Offers three brew size options: 8 oz, 10 oz, and 12 oz, catering to different preferences.  
- The 1.24 L removable reservoir is convenient and holds enough water for about four cups before refilling.  
- Its compatibility with hundreds of K-Cup pods, including tea and hot cocoa, provides endless beverage options.  
- Lightweight (6.15 pounds) and portable enough for places like RVs or small offices.  

[Check Keurig 062151516229 price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b098zqlkq5/)  

**Ease of Use**  
One of my favorite things is how intuitive this coffee maker is. Operating it is as simple as filling the reservoir, loading in a pod, selecting your cup size, and choosing whether or not to hit the STRONG button. Five minutes tops, and my coffee is ready! Cleaning is also straightforward. The removable reservoir, along with a reusable filter option (sold separately), makes maintenance far less annoying than anticipated. I‚Äôll admit, as someone with a packed schedule, having a machine this user-friendly is a blessing.

**Drawbacks**  
- The plastic build, while durable, doesn‚Äôt feel premium in some parts.  
- The machine can be louder than expected when brewing, which can be a minor annoyance early in the morning.  
- It doesn‚Äôt come with a reusable coffee filter. You‚Äôll need to shell out extra if you prefer your own ground coffee over pods.  

**Industry Competitors**  
Comparing to some other models, the Keurig K-Classic comes to mind. The K-Classic might have a larger water reservoir (48 oz vs. 42 oz on this one), but it lacks a STRONG button. If bolder coffee flavor matters to you, the K-Express wins here. Another competitor is Nespresso, known for its fancier, barista-style espresso machines. However, Nespresso often ties you into its proprietary pods, whereas the K-Express is more open-ended, accommodating various pod brands and even ground coffee when paired with the optional filter. This flexibility stands out for someone like me who likes to switch things up.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its price-performance ratio, I‚Äôd say the Keurig 062151516229 is worth the investment for those looking for a reliable, quick coffee solution with versatility. While you can find features like strong brews and varying cup sizes in pricier models, this one packs them at a budget-friendly level. The absence of some bells and whistles, like an advanced frothing system, can be overlooked since it already meets most requirements of casual coffee drinkers.

1npiuc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianParents/comments/1npiuc3/for_parents_with_kids_in_hockey_are_you_seeing/,For parents with kids in hockey: are you seeing the same issues I am?,"I grew up playing hockey in a small town in BC. I played up until bantams, but when it came time to move into midget the game felt too serious and I stepped away. For me it was always about having fun with my friends, not chasing a future in the sport. I am 38 now and do not have kids of my own, but many of my friends do and some of them are just starting out in minor hockey. Last season I spent a lot of time at the rink watching both junior games and U11 games, and what stood out to me was how much the culture seems to have shifted. Everyone looked the same: mostly wealthy white families, wearing the same kinds of clothes, drinking the same coffee, and driving the same vehicles. When I was younger there were more Indigenous kids involved, but I hardly see that now. I can‚Äôt help but think the rising cost of equipment, registration, travel and camps has made the game less accessible. With seasons beginning as early as late August, it feels like only privileged families can realistically keep up.

What also struck me was how intense the focus on competition has become. The pressure on kids to excel through camps, academies and extra training seems relentless, and that pressure spills over onto parents who end up working more hours just to cover the cost. Somewhere along the way hockey stopped being about fun and learning teamwork and became about advancement and status.

The other issue that troubles me is the darker side of hockey culture. When I was a kid I used to hear rumors about hazing or sexual acts with rep teams and I assumed it was just gossip. As more stories have come out, I believe a lot of those rumors were true. The Hockey Canada scandal involving the group sexual assault in Ottawa is just one high-profile example, but I have also heard first-hand accounts of hazing, initiations and other toxic behavior at lower levels. It is hard to reconcile that with the idea of hockey as a positive, community-building sport.

I love the game and it will always feel like part of my identity as a Canadian, but if I ever had children I am not sure I could justify putting them into minor hockey. Until the sport becomes more inclusive, more affordable, and healthier for both kids and families, it is difficult to feel hopeful about real change. I am curious to hear from others, especially parents with kids in the system today. Are you seeing the same things I am, or is my perspective too narrow? Are there examples of hockey becoming more inclusive or more affordable that I might be missing?",8,1758735943.0,CanadianParents,1,1.0,False

1npip26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1npip26/misdiagnosed_as_schizophrenia/,Misdiagnosed as schizophrenia,"Around three months ago, I moved my father into my home because he was being evicted from his home and was about to become homeless. A little backstory, my parents were divorced when I was a baby. My father was a great man, until he went to the neighbors house once and tried meth. He was on meth for maybe three years then stopped. He has always been a huge conspiracy guy, but he could hold down a job and everyone really liked him. He would love to talk about aliens and things, but he was able to put the topic away if it wasn‚Äôt something people wanted to hear anymore. Around five years ago, his conspiracies worsened. This was in the height of Covid and he was convinced the government was trying to take him down with the vaccine, which at the time like I said he was already a conspiracy theorist so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Then he lost his job because he was getting more and more paranoid. Suddenly he was telling everyone that space force was communicating with him and that he was the king and going to save the world, and space force has been talking to him through the TV. He would show me commercials and say ‚Äúsee look, those are your brothers‚Äù in completely random things like a liberty mutual commercial. He continued to get worse and stopped being able to take care of his finances and pay his rent, because he said his landlord was a part of the CIA and gave him the house so he didn‚Äôt have to pay rent. Fast forward to a few months ago, is when I got the call from the police department to please help me get him out of the house safely for his eviction because he was threatening them and they wanted to deescalate it. I moved him in with me and I started noticing more weird things. He was chugging coffee right before bed because he told me things chase him at nighttime so he has to stay awake and be alert. He was yelling at me for not believing he is king and not understanding why I wasn‚Äôt taking him seriously. It was getting so bad I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I called a crisis team and he ended up being 5150 for 10 days. They diagnosed him with schizophrenia. The thing is, I have also been noticing his memory is declining. I have to tell him multiple times where we are going when we leave the house, he forgets the names of objects, and he recently forgot which kind of surgery he had last week (heart surgery.) He told me there was a dog in his hospital room all night barking at him. Also when he was in the hospital he lifted up his gown and said ‚Äúlook how tiny my penis looks‚Äù laughing, which NEVER has he been inappropriate before but it feels like he‚Äôs losing that filter completely with me as his daughter. He has also become slightly incontinent where he pees a little in his pants before he can make it to the bathroom. He also shuffle walks everywhere he goes, and has resting tremors in his hands, though his right hand is worse. As I have been researching Parkinson‚Äôs which my grandfather actually had, I almost feel like my father could have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia instead of Lewy Body Dementia. I know this is complex but I‚Äôm wondering others thoughts on it as I wait on a neuro referral to help us figure this out. ",3,1758735600.0,dementia,1,1.0,False

1npiobn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1npiobn/find_out_if_the_neo_chair_mesh_office_chair_is/,Find Out If the Neo Chair Mesh Office Chair Is Worth the Hype,"Testing out the NEO CHAIR Mesh Chair has been an interesting mix of daily grind and comfort. At first glance, its mesh design intrigued me, particularly considering how many hours I spend glued to my desk. The product dimensions‚Äî24 inches deep, 24 inches wide, and 38.5 inches high‚Äîprovide a good fit for most home office setups. I was equally impressed by the adjustable features, such as its height control and tilt. But was this chair everything I hoped it would be? Let‚Äôs break it down.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, assembling this chair was a breeze. Surprisingly lightweight at just 18.7 pounds, it doesn‚Äôt compromise on sturdiness. Made of durable plastic with a sturdy square form factor, I could tell it would hold up well over time. The black mesh complements a modern aesthetic, blending seamlessly with almost any room decor. Arms with tapering legs and a solid back provide a consistent design while adding comfort. The breathable, high-quality mesh does its job to keep airflow steady, which is a godsend during marathon work sessions.

**Comfortable Features for Daily Use**  
Sitting on this chair for hours felt much better than my previous one. The foam cushioning offers ample support without feeling overstuffed, and that built-in lumbar support actually encourages good posture‚Äîsomething I desperately need. Adjustable features, such as its height (up to 20.5 inches), tilting ability, and 360-degree swivel, were excellent. Whether I was swiveling to grab a coffee mug or adjusting the tilt slightly during meetings, the chair adapted with ease. It claims to support up to 250 pounds, and while I‚Äôm nowhere near that limit, the sturdy feel assured me it could manage comfortably.

**Highlights**  
- Comfortable foam sponge cushioning for extended periods of work.  
- Built-in lumbar support encourages better sitting posture.  
- Easy-to-adjust height and tilt for a perfect sitting angle.  

[Check NEO CHAIR Mesh Chair price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b08kscdm47/)

**Downsides to Consider**  
Not everything about this chair hit the mark. The armrests, though functional, lack cushioning, which diminishes their usability over time. If you‚Äôre one of those people (like me) who leans heavily on chair arms while typing, you might find this a small letdown. Additionally, the chair seat isn't exceptionally wide; if you're someone with broader measurements, it might feel a bit cramped during extended use. One more thing to note: the tilting mechanism doesn‚Äôt offer a vast range of motion. So don‚Äôt expect this to convert into a full recliner during breaks.

**Critiques**  
- Armrests could use extra cushioning for comfort.  
- Seat size may feel limiting for users with a larger build.  
- Limited tilt angle, especially for relaxing between tasks.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking around the market, several other chairs vie for attention. Let‚Äôs consider something like the Hbada Ergonomic Office Chair, which boasts a sleek minimalist design but lacks the same level of adjustability. On the flip side, Steelcase chairs‚Äîthough exceptional‚Äîsit at a much higher price point, making the mesh chair from NEO CHAIR more budget-friendly. While you might opt for gaming-heavy chairs like some options from Secretlab, these often sacrifice breathable material for flashy designs and leather finishes that trap heat.

Where the NEO CHAIR Mesh Chair shines is its combination of price, ergonomic focus, and lightweight build. Unlike some of its competitors, which feel bulky or overly specific in their functions, this chair manages to straddle the line between an office and casual home chair quite well.

**Price Performance**  
After weighing its features against competitors, I can confidently say this chair offers solid furniture for cost-conscious buyers. Its price-to-quality ratio leans in its favor, given the comfort and adjustability that rival higher-priced offerings. The solid certifications like SGS and BIFMA give it credibility as a durable and safe choice. Plus, that FSC-certified wood structure inside underscores an eco-conscious manufacturing aspect, which is rare in this price bracket.

1npikaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacter/comments/1npikaj/a_banquet_for_one/,A banquet for one,"The first thing to materialize from that morass of unconsciousness is an armful of luminous roses. I had to squint my eyes lest their light blind me. Soon I can make out a chandelier, old and honest, like the one that‚Äî

,,Radov√°nek!‚Äù a cry cut the silence. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run around like that, you‚Äôll trip and scrape your knees!‚Äù That voice, a sweet, worried voice, stabs my heart like a shard of glass. I forced my stiff neck to turn toward the place she was calling from.

And in that moment, a cone of light appeared, and there she stood in the glow of an invisible spotlight. A long, maroon skirt, an apron with embroidered flowers over it, her gray-streaked hair in curlers. If my heart were still beating, it would have stopped.

She was looking in my direction, but not at me. Of course. Not even a dream will grant me the dignity of being more than a ghost of the past. I was about to scream, to yell at the injustice of it all, when something tugged at the corner of my coat.

I looked down. Hiding under the table was a small humanoid shadow whose tiny hand was examining the pus-yellow hem and whose pale little eyes were drinking in mine.

,,Are you a soldier?‚Äù  
,,I was,‚Äù I managed to get out of my parched throat.

,,Radov√°nek, don‚Äôt roll around in that dust! You‚Äôll have an attack. Go wash your hands before you come to the table, boy,‚Äù the mother called the imp away. I straightened up, only to find that a guest had joined us. A sad pigeon was sitting on the bench to my left. He might have been around 25, but his already pudgy cheeks made him look both younger and older at the same time. In profile, his bulbous nose and ridiculously upswept hair stood out.

He must have spent the whole morning preening in front of the mirror, only to find it didn‚Äôt draw attention away from the rest of his appearance. That was why he was now nervously pecking at the book he‚Äôd brought with him. The blue-gray suit didn‚Äôt fit him in the shoulders, and the shirt was already tight across his belly. He felt like he was playing a part and feared that others were of the same opinion. Oh, the foolish paranoia of youth, roots of fear that drill through foundations and poison the well of life.

,,That book,‚Äù he uttered suddenly.  
,,Pardon?‚Äù  
,,You know it,‚Äù he turned to me, fire in his eyes, ,,a fascinating work. As a student, I adored it. That depiction of the corruption of the human soul, selling out for applause‚Ä¶ I thought it was a metaphor for the state. That it warns of what our monarchy could become, were it not for order. That makes me all the more proud of my work,‚Äù he puffed out his chest, a proud bird indeed. I leaned over and tried to make out the cover of the book, but he covered it with his palm, leaving only the letter M visible.

And just then, a pale hurricane comes rushing to the table. He rubs his still-damp hands on his trousers and hops up next to the pigeon, who tries in vain to keep his distance. ,,And who are you, sir?‚Äù the boy pipes up with a smile.  
,,A scribe,‚Äù he smiled nervously. ,,You will be a scribe, Radov√°nek,‚Äù his gaze slid back to the mysterious volume he was guarding so carefully.

,,Really? And what does a scribe do?‚Äù

I was sorely tempted to jump in with a sarcastic ‚ÄúHe writes!‚Äù but I let it be. The pigeon gave a nervous smirk and looked up.  
,,He is a very important person. He makes sure that everything is recorded according to the truth in chronicles, in files, in reports. So that people can make sense of the world.‚Äù

,,So you make sense of the world?‚Äù that pair of childish eyes continued to interrogate him, full of expectations that would never be fulfilled.

He bit his lip, unconsciously, and a drop of blood welled up, giving him a splash of color for a moment.

,,Of course,‚Äù he exhaled with a feigned breathlessness and began to fumble in his coat pockets, masking his nervousness as an asthma attack. Except that his asthma had left him in puberty, and this only made him look more awkward.

The wood of the bench creaked painfully.

,,You‚Äôre slaving away for the government of the three-headed patriarchy,‚Äù a voice from my right cut through the atmosphere. ,,Me? I‚Äôm beyond that. Much further! You can‚Äôt even imagine how far you can go, Wilhelm!‚Äù he spread his arms so wide he nearly hit me. I turned to look at him, though I had long known whose backside was sprawling there.

He takes up so much space, yet seems so unremarkable. From the pale face of a full moon, framed by even paler hair like a shimmering halo around it, peeped slits of watery, pale blue eyes. He is fat; that is the only thing that lends youth to his otherwise haggard facade.

This head, a kohlrabi, rests on a gray shirt as if on a pedestal. His body, bound by suspenders into the shape of an H in a vain attempt at military flair, merges with the twilight under the corner of the table.

,,There's nothing like a mother's cooking,‚Äù he exhaled slowly, turning his head to me. ,,The canteen at headquarters is terrible. Sometimes I swear the flour in the sauces will suffocate me before my asthma does,‚Äù he grinned at his own joke. With a chubby hand, he toyed with his glass, swirling it as if for a tasting.  
,,We always did love our food,‚Äù I said through gritted teeth.  
,,You don‚Äôt look it anymore. Are you fasting? For what? For whom?‚Äù he bared his teeth. ,,For my soul.‚Äù  
,,And I thought vampires didn‚Äôt have souls,‚Äù the insolent putto smiled and finally raised the goblet to his puffy lips. As he opened his maw, it was easier to make out one of the small, thin scars adorning his mug. This one ran across the left corner of his mouth.

The pigeon wrinkled his nose at the decadent hog. For him, the sight of the new guest was a struggle. I could see it in him. In the way he furrowed his brow, which then shot up toward his already slowly receding hairline. In the way he widened his watery eyes and raised a hand with faded ink stains to his mouth.

,,Now that we‚Äôre all here, we can begin,‚Äù the mother called out, ringing a small silver bell she had pulled from her apron pocket.

The clinking of cutlery. In the blink of an eye, a platoon of plates stood on the tablecloth like little soldiers. Or rather, a platoon after an attack by the Gravediggers. In the middle of the table, the mother placed a steaming tureen. The earthy scent of the soup hit my nose and woke my dormant taste buds.

She took Radov√°nek's plate and gave him a ladleful or two. Then she handed the ladle to the pigeon, who was already helping himself.

I swallowed dryly and lowered my eyes. The empty porcelain stared back at me, mocking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I forgot that you can‚Äôt anymore,‚Äù my mother‚Äôs voice came from behind me, her hands already taking the plate away, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôll get you something to eat, my boy.‚Äù For a moment, I felt a warmth on my shoulder.

Silence fell over the table, broken only by the scraping of spoons against the bottoms of the plates. Everyone was immersed in their consumption. I wrung my claws and watched the faces of the diners. Those watery, pale blue eyes that I hide during the day behind the charcoal lenses of aviators, away from the barbs of the sun.

A pale hand holding a glass appeared before me.  
,,You need to eat, Radovan,‚Äù she breathed, once again present behind me, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve gotten terribly thin.‚Äù This time she placed her hands on both my shoulders and lingered there for a moment. I was incapable of a word, just mesmerized by the crimson liquid.

A chair creaked. Mother finally sat down at the table with her portion, too. At the head, of course, opposite me, in the seat furthest away.

For a moment, the table was shrouded in a veil of silence, broken only by the scraping of spoons. I rolled my tongue, which had long since come to resemble a dried plum, around in my mouth to keep it from sticking to the roof of my mouth. The goblet was a tempting but forbidden fruit.

‚ÄúThe soup is excellent, Mother,‚Äù the pigeon remarked, looking up from his plate to her and smiling for a moment.  
,,Indeed, the tears of disappointed monarchists give it a kick!‚Äù the kohlrabi jumped in. ,,Brother wasn‚Äôt hanging around the kitchen by any chance, was he?‚Äù he added, grinning at his own joke. Mother gave him a reproving look.  
,,Politics don‚Äôt belong at the table, you know that very well, Radovan.‚Äù  
,,But Mother, Leopold isn‚Äôt here,‚Äù he set down his cutlery and straightened up.  
,,He won‚Äôt be trying to smash a plate over my head for criticizing his beloved monarchy. And unfortunately, let‚Äôs be honest‚Äî‚Äù  
,,But we liked the monarchy. It took us under its wing, thanks to Father we were scribes,‚Äù the pigeon stammered, his eyes darting between the others before finally fixing on mine.  
,,I don‚Äôt understand, what happened?‚Äù  
,,We crawled under the wing of a raven,‚Äù I exhaled.  
,,There‚Äôs no such thing as apolitical ground these days! We are at war. Politics gladly sits down at the table and eats from our plates‚Äî‚Äù the kohlrabi continued his speech to no one, ignoring the youthful ideals.

‚ÄúSecretary,‚Äù the word rings out in the ensuing silence like a gunshot.

Those at the table freeze and turn their eyes toward the darkness.

From the shadows emerges a pair of boots‚Äîno, weapons‚Äîhobnailed combat boots, scuffed, cleaned so many times of the rust of blood.

The killer's heels are followed by a sturdy belt with the massive metal buckle of that insect that laid eggs in my cerebral cortex. A Death's-head hawkmoth. It holds his sadistic little tools and also cinches a frame that has long since gone to seed.

,,Minister-Major Groz, it is an honor,"" the kohlrabi-secretary rose quickly from the table. The man stopped, hands on his hips, and looked around at the gathering.  
,,For us too. We've decided to join,"" he bared his yellowed teeth.

,,W-we?"" the pigeon breathed out. And then comes the triple sound.

Step. Click. Scrape.

I dug my fingers into the tabletop. From the darkness emerged a stiff, dark brown uniform that blended with the surroundings. A dark yellow woolen collar, from which protruded a sharply-cut, parchment-colored face, stood out, even shone. Strands of mousy hair fall over his right side. He doesn't bother to tuck them behind his ear. It's more of a mercy, anyway. A crooked nose, a deep-set eye the color of a puddle. The peak of his rogatywka is pulled down low over his forehead. Another step‚Äîa roughly hewn cane ending in an axe slices through the darkness.

,,General Geier, what an honor,"" the secretary all but bowed. The vulture just nods his head and allows himself to be seated. He leaned the vala≈°ka next to him. The Major sprawled next to him, to the left of the secretary, who tried to shift away, but too late.

,,The second course is being served. Wine, gentlemen?"" offered the head of the family.

This time, she stays seated. Several anonymous waiters enter the scene. I can‚Äôt see their faces‚Äîmy eyes are drawn to the white gloves carrying trays, which they set down in front of each guest.

The warmth and aroma blind me. If I weren‚Äôt so parched, I‚Äôd be drooling like a dog.

,,So,‚Äù the pigeon stammered, eyes fixed on the cranberries crowning the sirloin in cream sauce, ‚Äúsecretary?‚Äù  
,,Minister of Resources,‚Äù he corrected with a mouthful of cabbage and pork, ‚Äúappointed in ‚Äô55.‚Äù  
,,With them?‚Äù the pigeon whispered, flicking his gaze toward Geier, who was slowly sipping his bowl of broth.  
,,Where else?‚Äù he replied, spearing a piece of meat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre doing just fine,‚Äù he said with a greasy grin.  
,,That I can see,‚Äù the pigeon muttered, glancing at the gut bulging between the man‚Äôs suspenders and instinctively touching his own, still modest one.

The boy was trying to pierce a plum dumpling with his fork, but it kept sliding across the buttered plate. They were like little sleds with delicious insides‚Äîwild game that needed to be hunted, but the hunt had turned into play. And I was glad for that.

The less he notices the new arrivals, the better. Just play, little Radovan. While you still can.

,,And you‚Äôre not going to eat?‚Äù the bull called out. He spoke quietly, but his voice‚Äîlike gravel‚Äîwas loud enough to stop the cutlery. All eyes turned to me, but mine stayed locked on his. Those dead, hazelnut-colored pits. He kept devouring his bloody black pudding without taking his gaze off me.  
,,I lost my appetite, Dimitri,‚Äù I replied. Because what could he do to me now?  
The brute just shrugged, muttered something, and went back to his plate. The atmosphere thickened. Mother, who was elegantly gutting a herbed pheasant, said nothing. I wanted her so badly to step in. To stop this. To drive the two of them away. But I knew the past is unchangeable.

The remains of the courses lay on the table like skeletons waiting for burial. The clinking of glass. The men sipped from their goblets. Radovan tried to slide under the table, his eyes fixed on the death‚Äôs-head insignia. It didn‚Äôt take long. I could see it in him‚Äîthat unspoken question forming on his lips.

,,You‚Äôre soldiers,‚Äù he said. A quiet statement, not a question. The bull grinned.

,,Oh, we are. These hands,‚Äù he raised his paws demonstratively and leaned over the table, ‚Äúhave handled more people than your tin soldiers ever will‚Äîor whatever you pampered little nobles play with,‚Äù he spat.

,,He‚Äôs still just a child,‚Äù I said flatly.  
,,But even a child grows into a man,‚Äù came the metallic voice from beneath the rogatywka.

The boy‚Äôs lower lip began to tremble. He went pale as ash and immediately searched for his mother with his eyes. She remained seated, her gaze cast beyond the table. As if saying: ,,You‚Äôre too old for that now.‚Äù He looked to me‚Äîbut turned away just as quickly, abandoning even the thought of seeking comfort in the ghost in the coat. The pigeon clutched his book with a convulsive grip.

,,Come here now,‚Äù came a deep exhale. Turnip scooted slightly away from the table and turned sideways from his masters. The boy didn‚Äôt hesitate. He ran around the table and climbed onto his knees. The man wrapped one arm around him, still holding his goblet in the other, eyes fixed on the room. No one commented.

,,Perhaps it‚Äôs time for dessert,‚Äù he said into the silence.

A bell chimed. Anonymous servants. The aroma of coffee‚Äîreal, heavy coffee that settles on the eyelids and shuts them. Festive porcelain, the kind mother only brought out on Sundays, for guests, for holidays. And the day I came back from that squad beyond the front.

I didn‚Äôt even notice the exact moment things turned. But the groan to my right gave it away.

The scribe was no longer dressed in pigeon grey. In a tattered, worn-out black coat, his still somewhat well-kept head now looked oddly out of place. He raised his calloused, road-dirty hands to his face in horror, where crimson brushstrokes had begun to bloom. The first cut went across his lip. Then a small cross beneath his eye, and one on his chin.

Metal clinked against the wood.

,,Kurva,‚Äù the secretary muttered, rubbing the red mark left by the family crest ring. Swollen‚Äînot just his fingers now. His belly had spread further over his thighs, now unavoidably brushing against Groza‚Äôs. The boy, older now and less frail, barely managed to stay upright.

,,Are you alright, Radovan?‚Äù the mother asked, eyes on the man in his forties now wearing a dark brown suit with a festering yellow lining.  
,,It‚Äôs the stress, Mother, don‚Äôt worry. Just‚Ä¶ too much salt!‚Äù he squeaked, then quickly added, ‚ÄúAnd please‚Ä¶ Wilhelm. I‚Äôm Wilhelm in front of them, Mother,‚Äù he smiled with that unnaturally wide grin that made creases around his otherwise sorrowful eyes.

Radovan said nothing‚Äîhe just watched the ring lazily rolling toward me.

The pigeon was the first to touch his dessert. Perhaps so he wouldn‚Äôt have to think about the fresh scars on his face or feel the others‚Äô stares. He timidly prodded the vanilla pudding with a spoon. The secretary followed, then Radovan. They shared a plate. Mother‚Äôs strudel. The smoke from Groza‚Äôs cigarette stung my nose. The general didn‚Äôt eat, only stared at the others with his one good eye, hands clasped before him.

I could see it‚Äîfeel it‚Äîthat apathy. The warm but suffocating heaviness of a full stomach, even though mine was devouring itself.

,,How...?‚Äù the scribe exhaled, staring at the secretary.  
,,Time. And many concessions,‚Äù came the reply, as he handed the boy another piece of strudel.

,,Why?‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt known silence could choke. The question wasn‚Äôt meant just for the secretary. No‚Äîit was for me. The end stage. I took the goblet in both hands and began swirling its contents.

,,Why, Radovan?‚Äù  
,,Why, Wilhelm?‚Äù  
,,Why, my son?‚Äù

The voices merged into a single mouth, filled with mourning. What could I answer? I had no energy left to play. For masks, personas, lies. And no reason. No one to lie to.

I had lost my soul while still alive.

I lift my eyes from the blood, but everyone is already asleep. The pigeon has laid his aching head on his book. The secretary leans back, snoring. The boy is curled at his side, head resting on the soft belly. The soldiers have closed their eyes.

And mother sits, watching me.

The shackles fall from my ankles. With great effort, I rise, goblet still in my hands. I creak like an old oak, but manage to stumble over to her before my legs give out. I hold onto her chair. She watches me. Those blue eyes‚ÄîI inherited them.

,,Mom,‚Äù I breathe, and in it is a sorrow and bitterness centuries old. She lifts her hands, wrinkled with age and life, and takes mine.

,,Drink, Radovan. Drink, my son. You can‚Äôt go on suffering like this.‚Äù She raises the goblet to my lips, and I close my eyes, giving in to her urging. I feel the strength of the scarlet, but also suddenly realize‚Äîit‚Äôs too late. My eyelids grow heavy. My hands go slack. The empty goblet rolls across the floor. She gestures to me, and I lower my head onto her chest. I feel her hands on my shoulders.

And at last, I allow myself to close my eyes. Because if this is the end, I want to go in peace, in the arms of the only person who ever loved me.",1,1758735292.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

They asked me if I have a health condition, and I said, ‚ÄúYes. But I shouldn‚Äôt have to disclose that personal information with you.

Synopsis:

Meet Ariel: a quiet plus-sized woman living by routine who finds her world upended when she crosses paths with the radiant, chaotic, and impossibly kind Holly. What begins as chance meetings over coffee slowly deepens into a story about connection, vulnerability, and the unexpected shapes love can take.

What to Expect:

\- A romance full of tenderness and charm

She stumbled across the road, filth-smeared and shaking, toward a diner. Lilith‚Äôs, its neon sign a stuttering pink gash flickering in the dark, a beacon in a world already dead. Sanctuary pushed at the door as she walked up to it.

The bell above the door jangled once, sharp, metallic, like a scream cut short. The toll of a funeral bell, marking her entry into a temple of endings.¬†

The brown haired girl shoved through the door into a crypt of flickering fluorescents and peeling linoleum. Grease stains and cigarette burns mapped a topography of ruin. The diner was heavy with the smell of meat pies and coffee gone rancid, fryer grease congealing, a faint tang of vomit and despair, a purgatory teetering on the edge of oblivion.

¬†The patrons were little more than dried husks attached to skeletons. A man with matted hair and black eyeliner hunched in a corner, muttering into a notebook, his pen scratching like teeth on bone. Another in a tattered suit at the counter, barking nonsense at a cook whose dead eyes stared through him, unblinking.¬†

¬†The sickly vomit colored walls were bathed in shadows stretching into clawing shapes.

She collapsed into a booth by the door, shrinking into the uncomfortable cracked red vinyl; her breath shallow and ragged. It stabbed into her back, making her clutch the bloody flyer tighter.  A waiter loomed, tall, skeletal, in a stained waitress dress, gray eyes piercing like ice shards beneath his stringy dark green and black hair. His smile was a cold, jagged slash of rust. ‚ÄúWhat can I get you, hon?‚Äù His voice was a monotone dirge, a thousand hollow echoes; his notepad a prop in a play no one cared to see.

She shook her head, brown hair matted with filth. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ waiting for a ride,‚Äù she rasped, voice a ghost, glancing out the window, the sedan squatting across the street. Its driver‚Äôs corpse was a slumped shadow in the gore streaked haze beyond the window.

The booth she sat in. Linoleum floors with faded checkerboard tiles. A row of spinning stools at the counter. The air closer to the kitchen smelled faintly¬† like burnt meat soaked in grease and something sweeter underneath. Like wilted flowers left too long in water.

It was *almost* normal.

¬†Eventually that waiter walked away, his expression blank as he walked into the kitchen though the door didn‚Äôt seem to move.

In his place came yet another waiter.

Six-foot-something in patent leather heels. Tan yet pale skin. Fluttering lashes. Pink painted lips. Long pink and black hair undercut with green ombre. A pale blue waitress dress with a name tag that read \*\*""Lilith""\*\*A scar on his cheek glistened under contour, and his voice when he spoke was a velvet mewl dipped in honeyed wine.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù he purred. ‚ÄúLook what the devil dragged in. welcome to Lilith‚Äôs Diner, where you‚Äôll always find what you‚Äôre lookin for, or it‚Äôll find you‚Äù

Sanctuary blinked.

‚ÄúCan I get another booth? This seat is broken and it's stabbing into my back‚Äù she asked, trying not to stare too long at the rhinestone choker reading **SERVE** in tiny letters. 

‚ÄúYou can get whatever you want, sweetmeat,‚Äù he said, snapping his gum. ‚ÄúSit. Sit. Coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She took the booth by the far window. The one where the blinds didn‚Äôt quite close. The fly buzzed again, thudding into the glass like it was trying to break free of its own reflection.

The waiter poured her coffee, black and still. Not steaming.

He smirked, lips twisting with knowing rot. ‚ÄúWelcome to Lilith‚Äôs Diner, people always find what they‚Äôre looking for or what‚Äôs looking for them finds them.‚Äù The words, cryptic and dead, a riddle from a grave.¬†

And that‚Äôs when she noticed him.

**The man.** 

Already seated at the counter. 

Four stools down. 

She hadn‚Äôt seen him when she came in. 

But now he was there. 

Crisp black coat. Hands folded on the counter. Hair like a river down his back, skin pale as moonlight on the snow, his black eyes like wells in a forgotten grave. Lips as green as fresh poison.

She shifted, dread coiling tighter, the diner seemed to breathe as she stood in it, she shook her head free of the thoughts before they could form.

She looked back at him, tall and lean, pale as bleached bone, dark hair framing a gaunt face sharp as a guillotine‚Äôs edge, his trench coat a black fog that devoured the light.

He got up and walked over to sit in the booth in front of her.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù A pause. His smile was thin, polite. Too polite. ‚ÄúBut I know you.‚Äù

He gestured to her cup.

‚ÄúYou take it sweet, do you not? Four grains, four offerings. Stirred widdershins, always against the clock. Backwards. Toward the grave. As if you already knew the gods you court are not the merciful kind.‚Äù

His statement hung between them like ashes falling over a freshly burned out house.

She froze. What did he mean by, toward the grave? What was he talking about? She stared at him in confusion, but ultimately decided it too strange to ask such questions.

‚Äú‚Ä¶How do you know that?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. Just tilted his head like an owl listening for the heartbeat of a mouse in the grass below the dead trees.

The crossdressing waiter leaned in, chewing pink gum with a pop.

‚ÄúYou want pie?‚Äù he asked, eyes darting between the two of them.

‚ÄúDo you have cherry?‚Äù Sanctuary asked.

The waiter chuckled, deep and dirty. ‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôve got sins that taste like every fruit on the tree, the vine and the bush. But if you want cherry, then cherry you will receive .‚Äù

He winked. And disappeared into the kitchen, though yet again, the swinging door never moved.

Like how the clock on the wall ticked backwards, each second unspooling like a prayer said in reverse, time itself bowing to widdershins.

The man stood, striding over like a shadow given life, he slid into her booth, uninvited, his aura a frigid abyss, movements smooth as oil spilling over a cadaver. He stared, silent, his gaze flaying her, skin, muscle, soul, until his voice slithered forth, a satin funerary hymnal.

‚ÄúYou lost something, little fly‚Äù he said softly, his ink black eyes shining faintly in the sickly dying light of the diner.

Sanctuary gripped her mug, taking a quick drink of it to try to calm her nerves.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr maybe you gave it away.‚Äù

The fly hit the window again. Once. Twice. Again. Always the same rhythm.

Suddenly, a patron walked in and above their head, A raven flew past and¬† swooped and snatched the fly mid-rhythm, its wings beating like the turning of a page in a holy book. A sacrifice accepted. A small offering consumed.¬† It then turned its head and made her jump in shock by cawing at her. Its wings flapped wildly before it shot back toward the still open door. It was as if it could tell her night had been horrific and it only wanted to make her feel worse.

The man across from her had sighed as the raven cawed.

He tapped his fingers against the table, once. Twice. Again. In the same rhythm the fly had done at the window. This caught her full attention as the raven flew away, as if the drumbeat of the fly was a whistle to the ears. She stared at him, his eyes, deep, unreadable voids, glinting with the cold fire of a dying star.¬†

His tar pit eyes swept the room, before landing back on her like a noose tightening. 

A shiver clawed along her spine.

His calm was a cosmic predator‚Äôs stillness, magnetic and annihilating. His presence a weight that crushed the air from her lungs.‚ÄúYou can be honest with me, little fly.¬† After all, all wounds remember‚Äù¬†

Each word was a nail in her coffin, hypnotic, unfeeling,¬† resonating with the darkness outside.

She swallowed, throat dry as caked dust on a church pipe organ, her voice a frail musical note. ‚ÄúI need to get back to the club. Bitter Blood‚Ä¶‚Äù The plea trembled, barely audible, her flyer crinkling in her blood-sticky fist.

He leaned back, a faint smile curling his green painted lips, enigmatic, cruel. A tease revealing too many teeth, sharp and glinting like shattered, jagged, glass. ‚ÄúI can take you. But there is always a price to be paid‚Äù His words swung into her, a promise coated in poison, wrapped in silk.

Her skin prickled as dread sank to her marrow. 

The unborn thing in her womb twitched faintly, seeming to sense him.

‚ÄúWhat price?‚Äù she breathed, fear and desperation choking her, her voice a dying whisper in the diner‚Äôs gloom.

He didn‚Äôt answer, rising with a grace that mocked life, extending a hand. His ong fingers were pale as death, claw like nails chipped black, radiating a cold that burned like frostbite. She hesitated, her mind a storm of static and blood. 

She looked out the window for a moment.

The void outside, the blood soaked sedan, the endless road, Ashriel‚Äôs taillights long devoured by the dark, offered nothing.

¬†Sanctuary sighed and turning back to him, she took his hand. His grip was like ice searing her flesh, she shivered,  followed him into the night.¬†

The diner‚Äôs bell was but a faint dying gasp as the door slammed shut, sealing her fate.¬†

The wind howled, a banshee‚Äôs wail caressing her skin, his grip a glacial burn as he led her to a black car, sleek and ancient. Its chrome dulled like a coffin‚Äôs edge, a chariot forged in some hellish pit. He opened the passenger door, a silent nod, and she slipped inside. The leather creaked like a snapping spine, cold and sticky with an unseen withering against her torn skin. He sat in the drivers side, turned the key, and the engine purred. A low, sinister hum, a beast rousing from a slaughter-dream.

They drove, silence a suffocating smoke clogging the air of that same burned down house that hung in the air between them. Nyxhaven‚Äôs neon veins bleeding into view, flickering signs, shattered windows, a city of ghosts and grunge stained ruin. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell me your name,‚Äù she murmured, voice cracking, a futile stab at tethering herself to something human.

The man in black‚Äôs dark eyes flicked to her, a glint of cosmic malice. ‚ÄúNames do not matter. Not where you are going, little fly‚Äù His tone was a flatline, promising nothing.¬† Her gut twisted in confusion but she shook her head free of it like she always did. Free of him, of reality, of the choices that led her here.¬†

Her only focus was finding Ashriel.¬†

The car slowed at a shadowed corner, outside the window, Club Bitter Blood, its neon pulse a faint, mocking smear in the distance.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made your first offering.‚Äù His voice was old wine, soaked in the vintage of centuries.

She blinked at him.

‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you will. You‚Äôll know me when the pavement kisses you cold.‚Äù

His eyes were ancient. *Butcher‚Äôs eyes.* But there was something else‚Ä¶pity? No. Worse.

Understanding.

‚ÄúDo you want to live? Or do you want to matter?‚Äù

His words were slithering tendrils wrapping around her very essence.

She didn‚Äôt answer.

She couldn‚Äôt.

She only stared, her belly burning, her thighs sticky, her voice gone as they drove onward.

He smiled, kind as a knife slipping into ribs could ever be kind.

‚ÄúCome then. Let me walk you toward the wound.‚Äù He pulled up to Club Bitter Blood and held out a hand which she took hesitantly.

He took her hand like a father, like a prophet, like a killer.

He led her out of the car and toward the doors of Club Bitter Blood. She stumbled out, legs buckling on the cracked sidewalk, blood and filth crusting her thighs.

The man in black didn‚Äôt speak again. He didn‚Äôt need to.

She followed.

Not because she trusted him.

But because the world had already ended, and he was the only thing left in it.

¬†Once they reached the doors, he turned, oil slick eyes gleaming, infinite and devouring. ‚ÄúGood luck, little fly, may the raven take you away, as peacefully as possible. But we both know that is not how this story is going to end, now don‚Äôt we?‚Äù he said, voice soft as a velvet lined coffin of amusement. His lips curled into a smile that cut sharp, final, a maw of too many teeth, each a fang dripping with the promise of murder.¬†

She turned to the doors, then turned to thank him for the ride, to ask him what the fuck he was talking about, to say something, anything, but he was gone. So gone as well was his car, not even the sound of an engine left behind.

The cold gnawed her bones, Ashriel‚Äôs van a memory incinerated hours ago, leaving her a discarded shell. She was alone, abandoned, her rejection a festering wound eating her alive. Beneath it, a darker thing writhed, her unborn child, a starving parasite pulsing in her womb.¬†

Its first kill was a taste of the slaughter to come, unknown to Ashriel but she wanted to change that.

¬†The flyer crumpled in her fist, smeared with blood and cum. It was her last thread to a love that was all she had. Even if it only existed inside her mind. Even if it was nothing more than a gothic lie in a world of neon and decay.

¬†Club Bitter Blood loomed in front of her, a siren call to her doom, her steps a stagger toward self-erasure in a universe that sneered at hope with a guttural, nihilistic howl. Somewhere, far away on the road, in the vast empty blackness of the night; the mysterious gaunt faced man‚Äôs laughter echoing into the neon drunk shadows around her.

¬†Her price was yet to be paid.",1,1758734748.0,WeirdLitWriters,0,1.0,False
1npibuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1npibuy/crazy_hunger/,Crazy Hunger?,"So a bit of background, I have cut before, total of about 55 lbs and was maintaining my lowest of 190 up until this past February. 

In February, I started training for this long distance hike which involved a bunch of cardio and dedicated lifting program, so I decided to loosen up my diet to give myself the fuel to train because performance was what I cared about most. 

But I was pretty sloppy with it, eating like a real asshole, stopped weighing myself, stopped looking in the mirror ect. 

Right before my trip I weighed myself in order to see how much my pack weighed and with my clothes and shoes on I was 219. Kinda bummed (I cut hard in the beginning of 2024 to go from 220 to 200 then 190 so this felt really shitty). 

I went and did my hike (150 miles in 14 days) with the promise that when I came back I would get my nutrition under control. I did loose about 5 lbs over the hike but I also might have been retaining hella water right before when I weighed myself. 

Now I‚Äôm back and I am doing the same things, the same calories, similar meals and snacks, as I did on my last successful cut, but one thing is different, I am so. Fucking. Hungry. All the time. I stopped the crazy cardio regimen and went back to a balanced lifting/cardio/rock climbing schedule but I am still ravenous. I am trying the classics, tons of water, diet soda, coffee, veggies, tons of protein and fiber. And nothing seems to be working :( 

Is there an explanation? Is there anything I can do besides increase my calories? (And no I‚Äôm not about to get my period, I already checked üòÖ)

TLDR: I have cut before but this time I am so hungry and idk what to do.

Not sure if that's the write corner to post this, let me know.

  
So I  own this old studio I used back in the day for photo gigs, but it was just sitting there doing nothing. I didn‚Äôt wanna fully waste the space, so I thought let‚Äôs try flipping it into like a ‚Äúcreator spot.‚Äù The real idea tho was more around the coffee side. I set up a small bar with coffee, matcha, sandwiches etc, and my thought was the longer I keep ppl hanging around, the more stuff they buy. Basically it was a test to see if it even works.

I added some backgrounds (brick wall w/ neon, plain white wall, cheap green screen corner), a few ring lights, tripods, and some decent cameras. Put in two PCs so they can edit vids too. Honestly I just wanted to make it comfy enough for creators to chill and hopefully buy more drinks while they‚Äôre there.

You walk  in and you‚Äôll see TikTokers messing around in one corner, someone doing a product review in another,  editing, half asleep at the desk. They‚Äôd share props too, belts, lipsticks, makeup pallets lol.

That‚Äôs when I thought, ok, let‚Äôs make a prop room. I knew some Amazon sellers, so I got them to send random stuff.  I got a bunch of random shit,  cat spray deterrent, random phone stands, power banks, whatever. But the creators actually used them bc they just neededsomething ¬†to talk about. but some   sellers are  hitting me up now for more.

Now sellers keep asking me if they can send more. At first I thought they were just desperate, but after seeing sales numbers go crazy a couple times, I realized maybe this little coffee test turned into a whole diff thing. Right now I don‚Äôt even charge for it, but I‚Äôm lowkey thinking if I‚Äôm dumb for not taking a cut when it‚Äôs clear the promo works. Only prob is tracking impact. Like how do I prove the sales came from vids made here vs their ads? how to compensate the creator? if I am getting a cut, they should too no? idk maybe I am just being greedy or some?",1,1758734682.0,Amazonsellercentral,0,1.0,False

Just came back from Italy and decided to never have bad/mediocre espresso again. Also have a new job, where I work a lot more from home, with a much bigger paycheck. So I decided to treat myself to a nice home espresso machine.

  
To start, I am not a coffee expert by all means. But I do have good taste (so I think). Right now I have a Delonghi Dedica, which did the/a job for a while (big upgrade coming from Nespresso before that), but I really want to up my game as I started to take espresso seriously the last year or so. I am going to get a excellent hand grinder (and great coffee beans) as well, but I made up my mind on that already.

  
I drink about 4 shots a day. I am a espresso kinda guy, but from time to time I like a good cortado or flat white. My wife drinks mostly flat whites with oat milk, but she doesn't work from home, so drinks a lot less from this machine.
I wanted to spend max ‚Ç¨1000, including the grinder. Now, what to do?

I kind of set my mind on the Bambino Plus, to get me used to serious espresso at home. Thought I'd do that for a few years and then upgrade to a Profitec Go or whatever. But this morning wy wife said, why not get serious right away? Why settle for a step-in model, if you're that serious and it fits the budget? She has a point.

The most difficult thing is that I really want an excellent espresso, but also want the comfort. I saw that there is a 10 minute warm-up time for the Profitec, and a switch to steaming of 5 minutes; I don't want that. If I feel like a coffee, I want it in a few minutes. Besides, I think I'm gonna like the manual grinding part, but I don't get enthusiastic of frothing the milk myself. Hence, the Bambino Plus. It really ticks all the boxes. Unless... the espresso tastes mediocre. Because that is my main goal, to get the best possible espresso within the ‚Ç¨1000 budget.  


I feel that this espresso thing is becoming a hobby already (rabbit hole!) and I think I'd like some tweaking with settings, getting fancy accessories, and learning about the process. But I definitely don't want to mod anything, and I don't want to be working 15 minutes on 1 espresso.

  
Help me! I already read all your subjects on the machines, watched reviews, etc. Just waiting for the golden tip.

Walls are Swiss Coffee and trim is currently white.  
I want to add a masculine, sophisticated contrast trim in here that still feels cohesive (nothing navy blue or urbane bronze although that would be cool) so would like to go with a taupe,

Please help me pick one or suggest others if you think they would look better. Current prospects are Jogging Path, Smokey Taupe, Twilight Gray.

A few things to note - couch has coovers on it but is kind of a taupe color called Macey Cashmere from C&B.  
Ignore the floors if possible - I know I need new floor and a rug but have an elderly dog with some incontinence issues so not making any changes just yet. Also ignore the goose painting since that's changing.

After painting trim, I anticipate having to trade out the hardware/ beam/ brick color for something a bit fresher. Possible a satin nickel knobs, whitewashed brick, darker beams? I also have a black PB recliner that I want to come down here and some bronzey sconces. That's the vibe.

My grandmother passed away about six months ago, and while helping clean out her house I came across an old local story that involved my late grandfather.

I actually remember bringing it up with him once when I was a teenager, since my dad had told me about it. He brushed me off, saying there‚Äôs no such thing as aliens‚Äîbut when I asked him what he thought it really was, he didn‚Äôt have an answer. 

He was a very skeptical, no-nonsense kind of man, so the fact that this stuck with him always made me wonder.

I decided to translate the story into English from the original language. I‚Äôve also removed the real names and locations to keep it anonymous, but otherwise it‚Äôs word-for-word as it was written down. I have used AI to translate it and I have double-checked the details.

‚ÄùIt was the end of November 1966, at a quarter to eleven in the evening, the sky was full of stars and the temperature was a few degrees below freezing.
At a local feed factory, the night shift had begun and a worker had delivered a few loads into the mixer. 

He drove out to the yard to fetch a new load. Then he thought he saw something strange moving in the sky in the direction of the overpass [place changed]. He picked up another load but stopped at the loading dock, stepped out, and switched off the forklift. Now he saw more clearly, and what he saw caused him to shout for his coworkers, who came running outside.

High up in the sky came a large red ball-shaped object, gliding overhead. As mentioned, the sky was full of stars, and when the object approached one could see how it blocked out the starlight as it sailed forward.

When the object reached roughly the point where a small stream crosses the road [place changed], it stopped and began swaying as it descended. It was clear that it was very large‚Äîby several estimates, 40‚Äì45 meters in diameter. It was described as looking like a yo-yo from which light or flames came out of the middle. Its color shifted from red to gray, orange, and violet, and it lit up its surroundings.

It hovered for a long time, about 800‚Äì1000 meters above the ground. All eight eyewitnesses felt a strong sense of unease. The air seemed to vibrate, as if electrically charged, and there was a feeling that at any moment there might be an explosion.
One man [name changed], who was present as a guard, thought to himself : ‚Äúthis is the end of the world.‚Äù

The UFO stayed in place, swaying, for 12‚Äì15 minutes, and the men discussed whether they should contact the local newspaper [name changed]. They did not, however, fearing no one would believe them if the UFO disappeared before anyone managed to arrive.

Then the UFO began vibrating as though large diesel engines had been started up. The men at the loading dock felt the vibrations as waves in the air. One witness believed it was as if the craft was checking its direction with flashes of light sent north and south. It tilted on its side, and the saucer-shaped outlines were clearly visible. It first headed north, then gracefully turned southwest.

The acceleration was violent, and in 10‚Äì15 seconds it had vanished from sight, one of the men recalls, adding that no one could comprehend the power the UFO displayed when it disappeared. And what‚Äôs more, it happened in total silence.

Everyone present was very agitated, and the incident left a deep impression on them. Many openly admitted that they had been afraid.
The UFO was long discussed among the factory‚Äôs workers [place changed], but no explanation was ever found. Someone tried to make jokes at the expense of the witnesses, but it didn‚Äôt work at all.

For some reason, the experience was so overwhelming that the witnesses refused to talk about it afterwards. Another man [name changed] recalls that he met resistance whenever he tried to ask someone about it later on.

Only now, 20 years later, have the witnesses been willing to discuss it. I want to say here that at least I believe that what they saw must have been something unbelievable, but at the same time something concrete. If anything can silence eight grown men, it has to be a UFO.

The canteen‚Äôs coffee maker was completely forgotten during the UFO sighting; it boiled dry and burned a hole in the wall. In the almanac, where the workers usually noted the day‚Äôs events, it was written that the UFO was the cause.

On the night shift, in addition to the first worker [name changed], were several others [names changed].
Later, a local newspaper [name changed] reported on the incident, and reports came in from nearby villages [places changed].

Every September, Trinidad, Colorado swaps its laid-back mountain vibe for a celebration of grit, gravel, and good times: The Rad Dirt Fest. Saturday, September 27, 2025.

Sure, the riders will grind through 110, 70, or 40 miles of rugged gravel under the watchful eye of Fishers Peak, but the real story? 

The RAD has become a community festival where anyone can plug into the action, whether or not they‚Äôve touched a bike in years.

Picture this: hundreds of cyclists thundering out of Trinidad‚Äôs historic streets at sunrise, tires crunching gravel as cowbells ring. The riders disappear into mesas and canyons, but the party stays in town.

Downtown Trinidad becomes the gathering place, part cheer zone, part block party. Local restaurants and shops swing their doors wide. 

Coffee houses keep the caffeine flowing. Restaurants with pizzas, wings, barbecue, and tacos that rival the energy of the racers themselves. 

Art galleries and shops add to the buzz, giving spectators plenty to explore while waiting for riders to return.

And when those cyclists roll back into town, covered in dust and sweat, downtown erupts again, music, laughter, and the collective feeling that everyone, rider or not, has been part of something special.

You don‚Äôt have to clip in to enjoy the RAD:

- Front-Row Spectating: See the riders start, finish, and celebrate right downtown. Bring the kids and join the cheers.

- Live Music & Entertainment: The RAD isn‚Äôt just about mile, it‚Äôs about smiles. Expect live tunes around every corner.

- Food & Drink: The flavors of southern Colorado (and beyond) shine all weekend.

- Artistic Spirit: Trinidad‚Äôs galleries make downtown an adventure all its own.

- Community Energy: Families, college kids, residents, and visitors mingle shoulder to shoulder. It feels less like a race and more like a reunion.

The courses themselves snake through the wild beauty of Las Animas County. Riders battle steep climbs, long mesas, and postcard-worthy views of the Spanish Peaks. 

And while only the cyclists chase UNBOUND Gravel qualifier coins, everyone else gets something better: a weekend in Trinidad.

When you‚Äôre not clapping for finishers, explore Fisher‚Äôs Peak State Park, stroll the Purgatoire Riverwalk. The RAD weekend is an excuse to treat yourself to a mini-vacation in a town where outdoor adventure and historic charm collide.

Since its launch, The RAD Dirt Fest has quickly earned a spot among Colorado‚Äôs must-do gravel races. Each year it grows‚Äînot just in rider numbers, but in community spirit. Past participants rave about the brutal beauty of the courses, but equally about the warmth of Trinidad‚Äôs welcome.

Be Part of the RAD

Whether you‚Äôre rolling on gravel or just rolling out of bed to snag a breakfast burrito downtown, The RAD Dirt Fest is your ticket to a full-throttle fall weekend. 

Mark your calendar for September 26, 2025, because in Trinidad, going RAD isn‚Äôt just for riders. 

It‚Äôs for everyone. [see ya there :]

1nphxw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1nphxw2/regretting_my_trigger_response/,Regretting my trigger response,"I have horrible guilt over an argument this morning. My toddler and I went to drop off some coffee for my parents (my dad is terminally ill). My mom had been caring for him and is probably exhausted, agitated and resentful (bad marriage, tumultuous childhood for me). In retrospect, I believe she picked a fight on purpose by bringing up topics that she knows will upset me. I tried not to engage at first, but this specific trigger set me off- she made this mocking face at me, a face that for 35 years has meant ‚ÄúI am going to continue to argue and follow you around long after you‚Äôve let it go, and stand outside your bedroom screaming at you when you try and escape me‚Äù. (Obviously I‚Äôve moved out, but that was the case until I was 19). 

I wish I had reacted differently, especially since my child was there, but it was like I couldn‚Äôt stop my body or my mouth. I exploded, which is what she wanted, and was yelling/crying right back at her. I was trying to get my child‚Äôs stuff to leave, and she followed me around, still going. I told her that I felt like I was 16 and plugging my ears in my room while she yelled through the door. Her response was, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear about your childhood trauma‚Äù. 

I yelled at her to shut up, and took my kid home without finding all of her things. I feel horrible that my kid saw that. I tried to call my dad and apologize for the scene, but my mom took the phone and tried to start arguing again. I hung up and now I can‚Äôt stop crying. I‚Äôm doing my best to be a cycle breaker, but I felt out of my own control.

I don't know what to do.,"A year ago, I (25M) met this woman (33F) at a coffee shop. She struck up a conversation about my work, I found her attractive, and ended up getting her number. For a few months, we texted constantly and met regularly. I fell head over heels for her. She admitted she had feelings for me too, maybe not as deep as mine, but enough to keep me hooked.

She was (and still is) going through a divorce and struggling with her mental health. Then, out of nowhere, she told me I wasn‚Äôt the right person for her. Around the same time, I noticed her getting unusually excited about attending a friend‚Äôs wedding (basically hoping she‚Äôd meet someone new there). She didn‚Äôt, but after that she grew distant. Fewer texts, fewer meetups, none of the affection she showed before. In the middle, she even flirted with a guy she met on a plane.

We fought. She blocked me. Then every now and then she‚Äôd unblock me, we‚Äôd talk, sometimes even meet in person. Each time I‚Äôd get my hopes up, only to be pushed away again.

Two days ago, after months of silence, I emailed her asking her to unblock me. She did, and when we met yesterday, she was back to the person she was in the beginning: affectionate, touchy, maybe even tried to kiss me (which I completely missed in the moment). I went home on a high, only to wake up today to cold, shallow replies again.

I‚Äôve been stuck in this cycle of waiting all day for her texts, just to get one-liners that make me feel like an afterthought. I never cared about her age, her past, her mental health, or her (failing) career. I told her I‚Äôd fight the whole world for her if I had to. But what I got in return was rejection, distance, and confusion.

Now I just feel like a clown who stuck around for scraps of affection.

1nphps5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nphps5/why_choose_xmnamc_dbl1_vinyl_floor_repair_kit/,Why Choose Xmnamc DBL-1 Vinyl Floor Repair Kit Review for Perfect Scratch Fix?,"The Xmnamc DBL-1 Vinyl Floor Repair Kit with Heat Pen is something I recently tested in-depth, and I have opinions‚Äîlots of them. It's designed to repair scratches, stains, and cracks on laminate flooring, furniture, cabinets, and more. With 11 color wax blocks and a heating pen for precision, this kit promises a lot. As someone who‚Äôs relentlessly picky about home improvement tools, I dove right in to see if it meets the hype.

**Design and Packaging**

Holding the kit, my first thought was that it feels well-organized. Compact and neatly packaged, it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm you with unnecessary components. The heating pen is lightweight without feeling cheap. The 11 wax color blocks are labeled clearly, helping users easily pick and match colors. While the pen could use a bit more ergonomic consideration, it still fits snugly enough in the hand to allow precision work. Honestly, thoughtful design like this makes repairing furniture less intimidating, especially if you're not the DIY type.

**Application and Usability**

I tested this on a wooden table that had suffered messy, deep scratches thanks to rambunctious nephews using it as an impromptu racetrack. After matching the closest wax color to the existing finish, I used the heating pen to melt the wax into the gouges. Within 10-20 seconds, the pen was ready, and it smoothly melted the wax into the scratches. A quick sand and polish later, the table looked... dare I say, pretty darn close to new. The instructions are clear, but I‚Äôd recommend starting on an inconspicuous area if you're a first-timer. Simple errors like over-sanding can happen, especially when you're becoming friends with the heat pen.

[Ready to snag Xmnamc DBL-1? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0ddq7vmf1/)

**Color Matching on Various Surfaces**

The real test was color-matching several different wood surfaces. The variety in this kit is impressive: black, dark gray, walnut, pine‚Äîa full spectrum that lets you mix and match shades for a closer fit. On a scratched oak cabinet, I had to blend two wax colors for an exact match, and it blended seamlessly into the grain. For a deeper gouge on vinyl flooring, the wax-filling remained durable after a week of foot traffic. However, if your floor has a super unique shade, you might face a slight mismatch, though a bit of creative blending can get it close enough to avoid notice.

**Advantages**

- Vast color options for versatile repair.
- Heat pen gets ready within seconds and is easy to use.
- Repairs look professional with minimal learning curve.
- Works for almost any surface‚Äîlaminate floors, wood cabinets, even linoleum.

**Drawbacks**

- Battery-operated heat pen lacks an AC power option.
- Wax may not perfectly match highly custom shades.
- Pen handle could benefit from a better grip for extended use.

**Target Users**

This kit is perfect for anyone dealing with old, scratched floors or furniture. Homeowners facing annoying marks on cabinets or gouged flooring will find it incredibly handy. Renters can rejoice because this kit helps avoid awkward security deposit conversations. It‚Äôs also straightforward enough for those uneasy with repair tasks, though perfectionists might nitpick subtle imperfections.

**Competitive Options**

Compared to some other repair kits, this one stands tall. Competing brands often offer fewer color variations or lack a heating pen. For instance, some kits just provide wax and markers, leaving you to figure out heating manually. On the flip side, a more premium option with a rechargeable heat pen could appeal to users annoyed by constantly replacing batteries. But honestly, for an affordable kit, the trade-off feels justified. Extra pros like quicker heating time and consistency seal the deal for me.

**Price Worthiness**

Given the robust color range, reliable performance, and an included heating tool, I‚Äôd say this kit offers great bang for the buck. You‚Äôre not only repairing but also preserving your home‚Äôs aesthetics at a fraction of what hiring professionals would cost. I wouldn't call it a long-term solution for major damage, but for touch-ups? It's nearly perfect. Just skip your morning coffee for a few days, and you‚Äôd cover the cost of this.

Lately, though, I‚Äôve realized that life feels more meaningful when you can share it with someone. I‚Äôd like to meet someone I can enjoy the little things with‚Äîlike going for walks, cooking a meal together, or even just sitting quietly in each other‚Äôs company. I don‚Äôt need constant excitement, just a genuine bond where both people feel comfortable. I believe in slow, steady beginnings, so even something as simple as grabbing coffee would be a great start.

If the audience knew what they needed, then they wouldn‚Äôt be the audience. They would be the artists. It is the job of artists to give the audience what they need,‚Äù English author Alan Moore.

Any creator worth their salt should ask themselves: what is the role of their art? Is it enough to satisfy primal urges for ticket sales and positive reviews, or should art strive to elevate society's awareness, encompassing both its concerns and triumphs? The popular catchphrases we see on social media like ‚Äúsupport local‚Äù and ‚Äúnurture new talents‚Äù are admirable, but are they truly practiced? Does not supporting mediocrity beget more mediocrity?

Recently, I was part of ""Kopi Kadai"" (Coffee Shop), a play orchestrated by Avant Theatre & Language. It was a wild ride, to say the least.

**A Tale of Missed Opportunities**

Audiences who enjoyed the show mostly did so because of veteran comedy actor and lawyer Vadi PVSS, who played the coffeeshop owner ‚ÄòTTTT‚Äô, and Nakulan Tinagaran‚Äôs versatile acting as the drinks stall owner ‚ÄòKannan‚Äô. One-liner jokes and references to Tamil cinema, such as T. Rajendar‚Äôs rhymes and M. S. Viswanathan songs, struck a nostalgic chord, especially among older audiences.

However, the focus on these two actors came at the expense of a proper storyline and character development for the rest of the cast. The set was also sorely underutilized and showed no changes throughout the different eras and time periods. Actors showed minimal differences, aside from costume changes and hair color variations.

More than half of the show consisted of fight scenes, to the point that a person unfamiliar with local hawker centers might assume they are breeding grounds for violence. These scenes included a fight between gangsters and 'Kannan', a brawl between the Thosai stall owner ‚ÄòMangai‚Äô with a customer and her daughter-in-law, and a customer fighting with the Chinese noodle stall owner 'Boon Teck'. These moments were, as Shakespeare says, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""

Having worked in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, I know that most food establishments operate under the mantra that customers are always right. They treat their patrons with respect to cultivate loyal, regular customers. While no one would deny that fights can happen in coffee shops, especially under the influence of alcohol, to suggest it's an ordinary, everyday occurrence is a grotesque misrepresentation.

**What Could Have Been**

Coffee shops are a melting pot of different cuisines, races, cultures, languages, and backgrounds. People come together to discuss everything from careers and marriages to government policies, all while sipping coffee and listening to the chirping of mynahs.

There were many real issues affecting hawkers over the years that the play could have explored. For instance, the gentrification of many local areas and the rising cost of living have directly impacted hawkers trying to keep prices affordable.

One scene that attempted to do this, set in the 90s, touched on the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and its implications for coffee shops. Infused with comedy, this scene would have resonated with the typical Singaporean. But while it was showcased in the Thursday show, it was cut from the subsequent shows on Friday and Saturday, citing a long show length. One must wonder why such a critical scene was removed over the lengthy and unnecessary fight sequences that left audiences with little but a headache.

Another criticism from audiences was the play's failure to address the subject of food delivery during the 2000s era, which was a major talking point during the COVID-19 pandemic. The play could have paid homage to the unsung heroes of that time.

**The Lack of a Coherent Script**

Many of these problems stem from one major issue: the lack of a proper, coherent script. Sources say the initial script, based on which the play was funded by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), was eventually abandoned. Most of the play was devised at the eleventh hour by the cast and crew. A proper script is the DNA for any significant work of theatre or film. Kopi Kadai ultimately became a mashup of different, unrelated scenes, lacking an overarching narrative.

Art, even in a comedic or popular format, should not shy away from a proper script, character development, and addressing the nuanced realities of the society it portrays. Theatre is serious play, and established drama companies should set high standards. It should not become a ""friends club"" where production needs are based on relationships and emotions.

Kudos to the team for their months of effort, but effort alone isn‚Äôt enough in modern theatre. Theatre has evolved, and audiences are increasingly intelligent. Ultimately, Kopi Kadai is a drama that people have watched, laughed at, and forgotten the next day. While its intent to celebrate local culture is commendable, its execution demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the artist's role. A true celebration of our culture demands a commitment to a coherent narrative, authentic representation, and a willingness to explore the deeper, more complex truths of our society.",1,1758733255.0,SingaporeRaw,0,0.99,False

So I work at a store, think like Starbucks but not coffee. There‚Äôs 700+ stores in the USA though I‚Äôm not sure how many are owned by my company‚Äôs LLC. Last year they switched some management positions. Promoting a coworker that‚Äôs been with them over decade at a different company, to ‚Äúmanager‚Äù but I think she‚Äôs officially just assistant manager. My location is located in an airport so I‚Äôm not sure if that makes any difference. But last year management gave me the wrong paperwork to renew my badge and I wasn‚Äôt able to work for three months. 

By the time I got my badge and got back to work, they were able to fire/ get most staff to quit and replaced them with her family members and her in-laws family. There‚Äôs about 27 staff members. She clearly favors her relatives and gives them all the hours. So when any one asked for more, she says there‚Äôs no hours to give. Meanwhile she gives her family 3-6 days and others have 1-2 days. There‚Äôs even someone on schedule that I‚Äôve never seen, who only gets three hours a week. 

The few people who try to speak up, nothing happens. We get told no and ignored. One of her in laws confided in me that she is tired of it too. And when she tried to text the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù for more hours, the manager of course said there‚Äôs none to give. My coworker pointed out why did she just hire her daughter and give her 3 days if there‚Äôs no hours. To which the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù left her on read for days and called her instead to tell her that the owners know and are okay with it. That she has an understanding with the owners so if she has a problem then too bad. A week later, that same coworker told me how the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù called her waking her up to say she‚Äôd appreciate it if my coworker stopped talking to other people about their conversation. Since then we have not been scheduled together so I‚Äôm guessing they tapped into the cameras and listened to us. 

Now I know we can try to let the owners know. But they don‚Äôt care. They gave her this position so she can cut corners and costs for them while she does what she wants in return. When she became manager, they rewrote the new hire package and made us all sign it saying, if we didn‚Äôt then that‚Äôs considered not  doing our duty and we won‚Äôt be scheduled until we sign. In the packet they fixed stuff like us giving permission to access the camera audio even though they always had it illegally before that. Things like we can‚Äôt file a class action lawsuit and such. So pretty much covering their tracks. 

So is there anything that I can do? Report it to? Something that can be done instead of just letting her keep getting away with it?",1,1758733023.0,legaladvice,3,0.6,False

  - **Net Revenue:** $22,853 (down from $1.29 million YoY due to discontinued operations and shift of focus to China market).
  - **Cost of Sales:** $7,374.
  - **Gross Profit:** $15,479 (vs. loss of -$31,971 YoY).
  - **Operating Expenses:** $2.27 million (compared to $3.41 million YoY; reduced mainly due to lower personnel costs).

  - **Other Expenses:** $50,320.
  - **Net Loss:** $(1.92) million (improved from $(3.80) million YoY).

  - **Net Cash Used in Operating Activities:** $(10.29) million (vs. $(2.61) million prior year).
  - **Cash Provided by Financing Activities:** $10.07 million (mainly from equity offering and private placement).
  - **Net Change in Cash:** $(461,818).

**Balance Sheet Highlights:**
- **Dramatic inventory growth** (up 180% period over period) largely attributed to expansion in China operations.
- **Convertible notes and related-party notes reduced to $0** from over $1.38 million.
- **Common shares outstanding:** 30,197,418 as of March 31, 2025 (up from 4,978,245 Sept. 30, 2024).

- **No stock options outstanding as of March 31, 2025**; prior options have expired.

**Business Updates & Segment Information:**
- Operations in North America have ceased; all revenue now derived from China (PRC).
- Major customer concentration risk in PRC, with Customer LXM responsible for 59% of six-month revenues.
- Acquisitions of majority interest in Beijing Xilin and completion of Shanghai Huomao acquisition in April 2025.
- Losses and discontinued operations in Korea and certain US segments accounted for in prior periods.

**Risks and Liquidity:**
- **Going Concern:** The company warns that it needs ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù additional capital to fund ongoing operations.
- **Heavy reliance on financing:** Recent operations are being funded primarily by new share sales; cash burn remains very high relative to cash on hand.
- **Litigation Risks:** Active legal proceedings with a former employee and an ex-director group. Management believes outcome will not materially impact operations but acknowledges some exposure.
- **Customer Concentration:** Significant revenue from a single customer in China increases risk.
- **Inventory Management:** Large increase in inventory levels could present risk if sales do not ramp up accordingly.
- **Currency and FX risks** due to multi-jurisdictional operations.
- **No income tax expense recognized** due to continued operating losses; significant net operating loss carryforwards.
- **Stockholder dilution** due to frequent and large equity issuances, along with outstanding warrants.

**Summary for Investors:**  
CIMG Inc. has taken significant steps to shift its focus to the China market, with a sharp reduction in US and discontinued business segments. The company's financial position has improved in terms of equity following multiple equity injections and debt reductions, but operational performance remains highly challenged due to limited revenues and substantial cash burn. Heavy reliance on continued external equity financing is a critical weakness, particularly with virtually no cash left at period end. Legal proceedings, high customer concentration, and very large, quickly growing inventories further heighten risk. The company‚Äôs ongoing viability is dependent upon its near-term ability to secure additional funding and rapidly scale its China operations. Investors should closely monitor cash balance, customer diversification, execution in new markets, and potential further dilution.

At that time I was hopeless with guys, so I did not really interact with him much at first. After a few days, we realised we shared a lot in common with our jobs and lifestyle. He suggested we meet properly a week or so later and that was the start of an unexpected whirlwind of romantic dates, constant messaging across social media, and not being able to stay away from each other. Then, suddenly, his energy shifted. We were both dating other people, so I shrugged it off and removed him from socials, assuming nothing more would come of it. I had been through that before. But then he messaged me, upset that I had removed him, and from there the on and off started.
That summer I ended it as I had a strong feeling he was seeing someone else and more invested in her. Still, we kept in touch, usually with me reacting whenever he reached out with something intimate or romantic. For months it carried on with arguments, then making up because we did not want to lose each other. Eventually he admitted he was relocating for work and mentioned other struggles, like mental health and family issues. I felt for him and did not want to add pressure, though I still gave into those affectionate and intimate conversations.
After another disagreement while I was on holiday, he blocked me everywhere. It upset me, but we eventually made up and stayed in touch, though I was never happy with his habit of blocking me.
By last winter he messaged to say he was moving back home and wanted to try again. I was hesitant but still agreed. He was still working away and busy, making excuses even when he was local. Over Christmas he fell ill and could not see me. When we finally did meet, we had a nice evening, but I noticed he was distracted and often on his phone. He told me he was going to Japan, apparently on his own. Later, when we met again, he repeated his story about it being a solo trip, but then left suddenly saying he felt unwell. Soon after, he went quiet and I lost my patience. I exploded, and later discovered through digging that he was actually away with someone else. He downplayed it, saying they had met by chance, but I did not believe him. Weeks later, after arguments, it turned out this acquaintance was now his girlfriend. Consistently telling him how sad I was hidden from his life which he would try to deny, hearing this started cementing into me how much he was serious about her unlike with me.  
I was heartbroken but not surprised and decided to leave him to it. Not even a few months later, he messaged again asking to meet for coffee. I refused since he was still with someone, but he then said it was not working out and hinted he was moving back home. He apologised for his actions when he went away with someone else and claimed work and stress pushed him into that relationship. For me, hearing all that when I had felt so discarded was disgusting.
Months passed before he actually moved back. In that time, I peeped and saw he was still going to events with his ex, her friends, and even her family. I found photos of him at events with them. I also realised his ex had blocked me, which raised more alarm bells. Even then, I agreed to meet him, hoping to confront things face to face. He denied there was ever more than he had admitted. I believe when he blocked me before, it was to cover up his involvement with her. He made excuses about social media, saying he did not want people he was not officially dating or that he was tired of scrolling.
We saw each other three more times and slipped back into a dating situation. He love bombed me, and I gave in and said it back because I did feel something for him, even if it was more for who he seemed at the start than who he had become.
Recently, it has all unravelled again. My birthday passed and he did not even speak to me. Then I saw him at a wedding with his ex in attendance, surrounded by her circle as well as his. He told me they had cut contact, but his actions showed otherwise. He still refused to add me back on social media, with more excuses, while her friends appeared on his. I even noticed mutual links with his work friends.
I cannot escape the truth that he kept me hidden while openly involving himself in her world. He has gaslit me repeatedly, making me feel crazy for questioning what was obvious. The final straw was seeing him at a football match, apparently with just the boys, only for photos to surface showing her there too. Maybe pictures do not tell the full story, but the pattern is undeniable. I cannot take the lying and gaslighting anymore.
I tried to raise things, even mentioning that I know his ex blocked me, and pointing out that his reactions show he has never had a clean break. He twisted it, made me feel like I had invented a story, and offered no reassurance through actions. He has a way of turning everything back to suit him.
Now I feel used and worthless. I cannot believe I accepted this for so long when I have always tried to be understanding and compassionate. If it were my sister or a close friend in this situation, I would have told her to walk away months ago.
We have now deleted each other‚Äôs numbers and agreed to close this chapter. He became defensive and accepted it, but without accountability, without apology, and without recognising the hurt he caused. He has not once said sorry. I am numb now after being such an idiot trying to believe he was a better person, but I hope karma eventually catches up with them both.

Something big. But to get there, we grind... one task, one late night at a time.

Still, I catch myself wondering: How? How can we make it all fit into just 24 hours?

Sometimes I even joke with a friend that we need a 36-hour day just to keep up.

As someone who dreams of becoming a self-made success, I started to seriously wonder: How do highly influential people manage their time? Like‚Ä¶ really manage it?

I came across this breakdown of the [daily routines of top performers](https://www.jibble.io/article/productive-people), Jeff Bezos, Serena Williams, Warren Buffett.

And it wasn‚Äôt what I expected.

Not the usual hustle culture grind where you wake up at 4 a.m. to ‚Äúget ahead.‚Äù Their routines were calm, intentional.. even spacious.

Here‚Äôs what stood out:

* They don‚Äôt cram every hour with tasks. They protect time for reading, thinking, training, and recovery.
* They batch decisions and avoid jumping from task to task.
* Mornings are focused, evenings are sacred.
* Everything, even rest, has its place.

That last one hit me.

I‚Äôve been trying to do more by squeezing in more‚Ä¶ But maybe the key is doing less, with purpose.

So I made one small shift: I started guarding my mornings for deep work. No meetings. No Slack. No emails. Just pure focus.

And then I started tracking it.

Turns out? I wasn‚Äôt spending nearly as much time in focus as I thought I was.

Most of my mental fatigue didn‚Äôt come from workload, it came from jumping between unfinished tasks all day long.

I‚Äôll keep adjusting and updating this post as I go.

But I‚Äôm curious:

What small changes made the biggest difference in your day-to-day productivity?

And do you think people like Bezos or Serena actually track how they spend their time or is it all just discipline?",1,1758732593.0,TimeTrackingSoftware,1,1.0,False

1nph5y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nph5y1/do_you_guys_actually_believe_in_campus_networks/,Do you guys actually believe in campus networks or student connections?,"To be honest, one of the most important reasons I came to this school was that my college counselor told me that the alumni network here could provide extremely important help for my future career and personal development. After all, you know, U of T is the most prestigious and elite university in Canada. But after I arrived, I was greatly disappointed. First of all, I feel that this university doesn‚Äôt uphold the classical humanistic values, and there are so many people.Every lecture I attend has at least 100 students (though I know our St. George campus even has classes with 200 or 300 people). This makes me feel like everyone is extremely atomized and has become very utilitarian.

Additionally, I‚Äôve noticed that the culture here doesn‚Äôt seem to aim at cultivating a group of people who can make outstanding contributions to society or possess a maverick spirit, like Steve Jobs. The university administration and campus culture seem to prefer that we obediently grind for a high GPA, enhance our resumes, and if possible, publish a paper, all with the aim of securing a stable job offer after graduation.

This vision of becoming a white-collar middle-class worker, sitting in a fancy office building, enjoying air conditioning, sipping coffee and snacks, and using a computer to complete tasks assigned by the team leader, seems to have become the life goal of every U of T student. However, what puzzles me is whether this approach is still effective in an era where AI is becoming increasingly important, offering highly cost-effective and extremely cheap labor.

I recently read an article on Stack Overflow: [AI vs Gen Z: How AI has changed the career pathway for junior developers](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/09/10/ai-vs-gen-z/.In).

In simple terms, the article points out that entry-level positions for Gen Z (those born after 1995, though I believe most people browsing this subreddit were likely born after 2000) are becoming increasingly scarce. AI is making junior software developers less and less needed. The future will be an era of human-AI collaboration, where we need to evaluate the answers provided by AI and its tempo in specific contexts, and, more importantly, individuals need to proactively adapt to the skills truly required in the AI era. However, I find that this university is extremely lacking in this regard.

That being said, even if most people follow the standard white-collar career path of university internships, job entry, and promotions, personally I don't find myself particularly interested in or in need of such conventional routes. I don't want to hide anything - I do come from a relatively wealthy family in China, and my parents have provided me with a solid financial foundation. Even if I don't work, the amount of money I can spend or access in a year might exceed what some of my classmates would earn a decade after graduation. This has left me with little motivation to understand their struggles. For instance, when a friend told me about focusing on GPA to get into grad school and then land a good job, I found it utterly boring - it felt like their life was already scripted by some predetermined plan. Furthermore, the recently published paper [Genius on Demand: The Value of Transformative Artificial Intelligence](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f227491.pdf)(Interestingly, I later discovered that the main authors of this paper were several professors from UofT's Rotman School of Management)presents an extremely pessimistic view, arguing that as AI grows increasingly powerful, it will replace most jobs, leaving only a handful of geniuses capable of creating real value. This makes me seriously question whether their efforts are truly meaningful.

I just had to get this off my chest, and I feel much better saying it. To be honest, I'm kind of disillusioned with this place. I feel like my counsellor tricked me into coming here. It's not as good as she made it out to be. But maybe I'm just not the right fit for this place...",0,1758732113.0,UofT,12,0.25,False
1nph4xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1nph4xe/nui_cobalt_autumn_2_is_coming_43_reviews_from/,Nui Cobalt Autumn 2 is coming! 43 reviews from past years,"Nui Cobalt's Autumn 2 collection is coming back on Friday! UPDATE: they just announced that it's been pushed back a week to Friday, October 3.

It's a fantastically autumnal collection, all spookiness, pumpkins, the Spidersilk variants, and, of course, Halloween! We won't find out which past releases are coming back, or the names and notes descriptions for all of this year's new releases, until the newsletter on Thursday (tomorrow), and I haven't seen any teasers about what's coming, so I am feeling awfully impatient!

As I like to do for each collection, here are my thoughts on all of the Autumn 2s I've tried - some of these have been discontinued, but you never know when something might come back, or perhaps you might find one in the swaps and be looking for a review.

**A note about my preferences:**¬†I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn‚Äôt usually work on me). I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, dragon‚Äôs blood, leather, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general. To my great devastation, Nui Cobalt‚Äôs apricot, pear, and honeysuckle notes don‚Äôt tend to work on me, though I haven‚Äôt given up hope and I continue to try new blends with those notes occasionally.

Some of these were provided as press samples in exchange for honest reviews.

Buckle up, friends, and get yourself a cup of tea; I've tried a *lot* of past Autumn 2s! In alphabetical order, with all the Spidersilks in their own separate section at the bottom.

\[Wow - this post is so long it has exceeded the maximum allowed length! I'll try posting again, this time moving the Spidersilk variants to a comment.\]

\~\~\~

**Au Bal Masque**¬†\[Nepalese virgin cashmere, cotton flower, vanilla spun sugar, labdanum, and the wafting memory of white funeral lilies\] - I get more cotton than cashmere - this is a very clean scent rather than a cozy scent - and it's quite floral, the funeral lilies reminding me strongly of¬†**Pale as Death**¬†(see below) although¬†**Au Bal Masque**¬†is significantly less powdery. There's something deeply unearthly about this one. It feels fragile and delicate (""spun sugar"" is a perfect descriptor) but also with something slightly unsettling lurking underneath. (Which is absolutely the labdanum. I can take labdanum in very small amounts or as part of a very warm, golden amber accord. I tend to find labdanum awfully sinister in other contexts!) You know the ball scene in¬†*Labyrinth*? Sarah in her big floofy gown, the sumptuousness of the ball, the haughty, fairy-like people around her, and the growing undertone of goblin menace? This perfume is¬†*that*.

**Awaken the Witch**¬†\[Leather bound grimoires on mahogany shelves. A cup of hot tea, subtly sweetened with vanilla bean and honey. Sandalwood incense mingling with black patchouli, cardamom, and coriander\] - I approached this scent with great trepidation. Some notes tend to be automatic no's for me - labdanum, hay, leather, patchouli, for example. Sometimes if it's clearly only a background note, I might still order a sample of something with one of these notes, like¬†**Morari Day After Halloween**¬†\[Tootsie roll accord, coumarin, hay absolute, ambrette, soft musk\] with its hay note, or¬†**Arcana Eir**¬†\[A sheer veil of gentle Roman chamomile tea, wild lavender buds, vanilla bean, warm flannel, ivory patchouli, and fresh coconut milk infused with petals of tuberose and magnolia\] with its ivory patchouli (and both of those scents ended up being huge hits for me!). But¬†**Awaken the Witch**¬†was an experimental choice for sure because it seems to feature several of the notes I usually shy away from! Leather and black patchouli don't look like background notes; they look like front-and-center notes. But enough people raved about its beautiful black tea that I just had to try it, and I‚Äôm¬†*so*¬†glad that I did. Nui Cobalt has the most¬†*glorious*¬†tea note.¬†**Awaken the Witch**¬†is¬†**Blarney**¬†\[The warm, tannic comfort of a proper Cuppa sweetened with a touch of raw honey and smoothed with fresh cream\] - a perfect cup of lightly-sweetened black tea ‚Äì but the other notes, the leather, mahogany, incense, patchouli, and spices, swirl around it and coalesce into the most magical scent of witchy confidence. A little dark, a little earthy, but nothing harsh or screeching. It‚Äôs absolute¬†*perfection*. If, like me, you‚Äôre skittish of leather or patch, this is a really phenomenal one to try because it‚Äôs so well-blended and honestly it would be a poorer scent without those notes. I remain really startled by how much I like this. I FS it a few years ago, and it, along with **Bibliomancy** and **The Headmistress** (see below), remain some of my all-time most beloved fall scents.

**Basic Witch**¬†\[An impeccable pumpkin spiced latte conjured from true Ceylon cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, candied ginger, cardamom, espresso, steamed vanilla oat milk, and a surreptitious shot of Grand Marnier\] - Yep, that's a pumpkin spice latte! I confess that as a tea drinker I've never actually had one of these famed autumn drinks, but it's hard to miss - pumpkin spice (heavy on the nutmeg) over a shot of chocolatey espresso and NCD's cuddly oat milk, sweetened with maple syrup. I smelled the orange of the Grand Marnier in the vial but not on my skin. ""Basic"" this combination might be, but it's well-loved for a reason and it feels so very autumnal. However, espresso continues to be not really my thing; I guess I was hoping for mostly chai spices and pumpkin rather than this strong coffee.

**Bats in the Belfry**¬†\[Fuzzy brown fur accord on soft golden hay that‚Äôs been infused with decades of frankincense and myrrh, guaiac wood, oudh, copal resin, and amber musk\] - This one is honeyed amber and animal fur, with an undertone of cinnamon and orange citrus. I was enticed to try this one by a number of reviews praising its inherent snuggliness, but it doesn‚Äôt really read as particularly snuggly to me - I guess I need vanilla, sandalwood, ambrette, cardamom, or some combination of those for something to reach peak coziness! There's nothing wrong with this one, it's quite nice if you go in for honey and fur musk, but it's not really for me. I feel like it should work better for me than it actually did.

**Bibliomancy**¬†\[The vanillic scent of brittle pages, well-worn leather bindings, dried lavender and forget-me-not blossoms pressed beneath translucent vellum, Peru balsam, Omani frankincense, and oudh\] -This one¬†*immediately*¬†became another top favorite autumn scent when I first tried it - it makes me swoon with absolute delight. It's a vanilla-papyrus paper note with delicate florals. This lavender is of the sweet perfumey variety, not herbal at all, and the forget-me-not really does add a little extra daintiness, and there's hints of leather for grounding and the memory of incense. Like¬†**Starlight and Spidersilk**, the vanilla quality to this edges ever-so-slightly soapy, but I really love that effect (which is why I love so many of the Spidersilk variants). It is by far my favorite of Nui Cobalt's book-themed perfumes! And it's another one that I FSed.

**Canoodling in a Crypt**¬†\[Dead leaves, black amber, iced chai, cathedral incense, graveyard dirt, and languid Egyptian musk\] - This is the icy, vampiric brother to the other Canoodling scents, without the warmth of¬†**Canoodling in a Leaf Pile**¬†\[Warm chai, vermilion musk, copal resin, the subtle hint of a campfire\] or¬†**Canoodling in the Library**¬†\[Brittle pages bound in leather, tall mahogany shelves, blushing leaves fallen upon ancient stone stairs, amber resin, warm skin musk, and vetiver\]. There is very little warmth to¬†**Canoodling in a Crypt**, only an icy sophistication. This vampiric scent smells mad expensive due to the Egyptian musk (which does get slightly soapy over time as it sits on my skin), and it's backed by chai spices (here stripped of their warmth but with the fiercely autumnal aspect still remaining) and that glorious NCD cathedral incense note. The dead leaves and dirt add just a hint of earthiness that literally serves to bring this scent down to earth, keeping it from being solely moody and unearthly.

**Cemetery Soiree**¬†\[Mossy stone walls, lanterns aglow, steam from a cauldron of hot spiced cider, funeral flowers catching rain from crimson leaves above\] - A fantastically atmospheric spiced apple cider, with stone and petrichor demanding attention, and shy hints of white lilies and quiet yet earthy red musk in the background. This is SO COOL - what a weird and interesting and super-autumnal combination.

**Crone's Cottage**¬†\[Oatmeal cookies still warm from the oven, beeswax candles on the windowsill, a warm cup of strong black tea with milk, and a generous dollop of honey\] - This one is beeswax and oatmeal cookies, and just a hint of cinnamon. The tea is nowhere to be found when first applied, but steadily makes its presence known, though it remains a background player. On the drydown, it's oats and honey with a backdrop of beeswax and tea. Personally, I sort of wish the balance of the notes was reversed (more beeswax and tea, and less oats and honey), but that's just because I love NCD's black tea and beeswax notes so much.¬†**Crone's Cottage**¬†is such a cozy autumnal scent. It's been long discontinued and I sometimes see really desperate ISOs for it, so we can all hope one day it might come back in a new formulation.

**Crown of Hekate 2021**¬†\[Moonflower and myrrh over shining white amber on a pillow of sheer vanilla.\] - This perfume is one of those frustrating ones that smells¬†*so*¬†amazing in the vial and then my skin just kills it. In the vial it's the most gorgeous white floral + white amber + vanilla, but on my skin, the myrrh takes over and gives the scent an overpowering earthiness. Even wearing it in my hair doesn't quite tone down the myrrh enough for the unearthly beauty of the moonflower to come through.

**Entombed**¬†\[Cemetery stones enshrouded in mist, wild English lavender, rain, and freshly turned earth\] - With its lavender and stone, it smells very similar to¬†**Gargoyle**¬†\[Rain-drenched lavender, cathedral incense, beeswax candles, and ancient stone\]. The ""earth"" in¬†**Entombed**¬†note smells almost faintly like smoke to me - like the smoke from lighting real-life incense but without much of the incense smell itself, or the whiff of a blown-out match but without the sulfur. As in¬†**Gargoyle**, this lavender note is herbal and pungent and so true-to-life. I've seen reviews recommending this as a sleep scent, and I completely see what they're getting at, but for me this is a little too dark and ominous to be comfortable for sleep. I always find myself sniffing this and wishing, for a sleep scent, that it were lighter and sweeter, maybe with some vanilla. But if you're into darker scents, or wishing for an earthy herbal lavender, this is absolutely one to try. I can also note that after several years of aging, the soil note calmed down considerably, and the whole scent became less dark (in fact there developed almost a marshmallow-like powderiness).

**Exorcised**¬†\[Snow-covered spruce, rock moss, chilled Earl Grey and pale frankincense\] - It's first and foremost an evergreen scent, all sharp fir needles calling to mind a chill wintery day, plus quiet green moss, black tea, and the gentlest of incense. It's a fairly close cousin to my beloved¬†**Cloak of Evergreens**¬†\[Snow-covered spruce, iced cedar tips, golden pine sap, icicle musk, and the fading memory of tea by the fireside\] but a little chillier, and where¬†**Cloak of Evergreens**¬†is primarily an incensey black tea with the tree note behind it, the ratio is reversed here for a mostly-tree scent with a black tea accent. Gorgeous! And very wintery. I thought this would be an early fall scent for me, so I originally saved it to first-try once autumn arrived, but has turned out to be a beloved November/December/January perfume.

**Forbidden Library**¬†\[The vanillic scent of aging paper infused with ceremonial incense, venerable bookshelves of black oak and sweet himalayan cedarwood, a hint of mossy stone, and an undercurrent of faded suede\] - Vanillic paper, leather book covers, and incense. I smell the wood notes in the vial but not really on my skin. I didn't notice stone or moss until I looked at the notes list; now I suppose I can pick them out if I look.¬†**Forbidden Library**¬†is a bit darker and more shadowy than¬†**Bibliomancy** (see above), and it lacks the gorgeous delicate floral accents of¬†**Bibliomancy**. I like this more than¬†**Stories & Spidersilk**¬†(see below) and¬†**Bibliophilia (Love of Books)**¬†\[The vanillic scent of aging paper, the tang of fresh ink, venerable bookshelves of oak and mahogany, a sweet trace of pipe tobacco, an undercurrent of faded leather\] thanks to the incense, and about on par with¬†**Canoodling in the Library**¬†\[Brittle pages bound in leather, tall mahogany shelves, blushing leaves fallen upon ancient stone stairs, amber resin, warm skin musk, and vetiver\], which is also gorgeously autumnal. I will happily wear this sample, but¬†**Bibliomancy**¬†remains unquestionably my favorite of the NCD bookish scents.

**Ghost Train**¬†\[Stark white copal, cedarwood, coal dust, grey cashmere, cardamom, toasted marshmallow, and shining steel\] - Very atmospheric! On me it's primarily toasted marshmallow, with that hint of burnt caramelization, backed by a light scattering of copal smoke and ash. Interestingly, the smoke and ash notes don't make the scent feel like ""burned marshmallow"" but instead it's very distinctly toasted marshmallow + ash. I don't get cardamom (but then, I've never really gotten much cardamom from any NCD perfumes, even when it's a listed note), but there is a bit of snuggly cashmere. That ash note, while gentle, is very atmospheric, so this won't be an everyday perfume for me. I ended up wearing it to see¬†*Hadestown*¬†when it came through my city, and it was¬†*perfect*¬†given how much the train features in that musical - and how slightly uneasy the vibe of that show is. Several later it becomes a cozy but not too sweet marshmallow, with the faint memory of the cashmere, smoke, and ash notes. This one's notes may sound a little weird but it is¬†*such*¬†a great perfume.

**Glass Pumpkin**¬†\[Spiced pumpkin puree, a drizzle of hot caramel, coconut flakes, lime zest, hinoki wood, elderflower, and icy dark musk\] - As soon as this was announced, I¬†*had*¬†to know what it was like. Pumpkin and caramel plus (most of the notes of) my beloved (and discontinued!)¬†**Nelophilia (Love of Glass)**¬†\[Elderflower, silver musk, coconut water, cardamom, silk tree, lime blossom, and smooth hinoki wood\]? Sign me up! In the vial, the two aspects fight with each other: warm, caramely, spiced pumpkin at war with the cooler, smooth and standoffish, almost aquatic¬†**Nelophilia**. On my skin, though, it really kind of works!¬†**Glass Pumpkin**¬†goes on with a short-lived blast of nutmeg (I couldn't smell anything else for about 30 seconds), and then settles into a seriously interesting scent. Sometimes I get caramel + pumpkin, and on alternate sniffs I get straight-up just plain¬†**Nelophilia**, but the most fascinating sniffs are every third one or so, when I get both. As in the vial, it's still a mix of warmth and coolness, but on my skin they meld into a fairly harmonious whole. At least for a while; the¬†**Nelophilia**¬†notes are definitely the top notes, and they disappear long before the creamy caramel, which lasts well into the afternoon. Does it represent a ""glass pumpkin""? I'm not entirely sure, but I'm also totally taken in by this scent.

**The Headmistress**¬†\[Black silk, cardamom, ancient paper on a mahogany desk, sandalwood incense, cold ginger ale, a slender slice of lime, and a dish of candied violets\] - It's ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. I blindly FSed this last year when it first came out and I regret nothing. Even on first wear I could already tell this would be a holy grail for me. Nui Cobalt always does silk, mahogany, and sandalwood incense so well. (As usual, I get little to no cardamom from NCD, alas.) There's no black tea listed in the notes, but it really reminds me so strongly of the sandalwood incense/black tea duo of **Awaken the Witch**¬†(see above), but where that one was accented by patchouli, honey, and leather,¬†**The Headmistress**¬†is accented by an elegant but indistinct woodsy-floral with soft nuances of silk and paper. I adore it so much. One downside is that it has low longevity, at least so far, but based on my experience with¬†**Awaken the Witch**, I expect it to gain longevity as it ages. (I haven't started wearing **The Headmistress** yet this fall but I can report back when I do, about how it has aged for a year.)

**Mad Scientist**¬†\[A shape-shifting Jekyll and Hyde of a scent. It begins with acid green top notes of Mexican and Persian limes spiked with piquant cardamom. Then a total transformation occurs, revealing blackest vanilla and smooth salted caramel\] - Nothing but caramel in the vial, but it becomes a whole journey on my skin. At first, it's luxurious caramel with an acid-green lime. That lime is stunning; it's vibrant and zingy and unapologetically buoyant. After it begins to dry down, the cardamom starts to emerge, starting as mere vague baking spices but developing into a slightly muted rather than spicy cardamom. With the lime receding at this stage, it becomes more gourmand - now it's more caramel + cardamom with a baking of lime zest, rather than the stunning opening of ""I am lime, let's get things done!"" The description as ""shape-shifting"" is 100% exactly right. It dries down into a caramely vanilla (strongly reminiscent of¬†**Ailurophilia (Love of Cats)**¬†\[Egyptian musk, tonka, and dulce de leche wrapped in luxuriant cashmere, soft suede, wisps of sandalwood and copal smoke\]) with a hint of cardamom. The lime is quickly gone, but that was always going to be a flashy and short-lived top note.

**Mesonoxian**¬†\[Vanilla bean warmed over glowing embers of cedar resin, sweet myrrh, black amber, santal, and silken oudh\] - This one is¬†*awesome*. My experience of it is just a little different than the listed notes - I get incense, tonka, and black tea backed with spices, honey, and cream, and just a drop of black patchouli. It actually reminds me quite a bit of¬†**Awaken the Witch**¬†(see above), and now I'm laughing to see just how often I compare another Autumn 2 to **Awaken the Witch**.¬†**Mesonoxian**¬†is an absolutely¬†*gorgeous*¬†autumnal scent, all incense and spice paired with both subtle sweetness and shadowy darkness. I thought¬†**Oubliette**¬†would be my biggest hit from 2023's new releases, but **Mesonoxian** turned out to be my favorite from that set.

**Mourning Veil** \[Melancholy layers of black vanilla bean, white sandalwood, petrichor, tear-stained taffeta, suede gloves and a silk-lined mahogany coffin\] - Oh gosh, I looked for this one for *years* \- I didn't learn of its existence until it was already discontinued - and *wow*, the search was worth it. In the bottle, I only smell strong suede and a background of petrichor - interesting but not likely to be quite my thing - but on my skin it blossoms into the most wonderful, silky, sexy, sophisticated scent, with warm mahogany, plush fabric notes, and a sweet, white-ambery vanilla joining the suede (and I no longer get any distinct petrichor, though it's definitely there providing depth and nuance). It's absolutely *stunning*, and very much a cousin to another beloved favorite, **Indie Mood: Giulia** \[White santal and sunwashed teak edged with vetiver, silk, and chilled Earl Grey\]. Truly, this is probably one of my top 5 or even top 3 perfumes of all time, and I *so* hope it comes back in a reformulation someday so that I can make you all try it (and also so I can get another bottle; I only ever managed to find a partial in the destashes). It's SO GOOD.

**Oubliette**¬†\[Antique violet, creme de cassis, chilly stone musk, agarwood, patchouli, black vanilla, and bitter myrrh\] - I first-tested this one without looking at its notes, and all I remembered of the exact notes description was the violet. I then headed out to sing a dress rehearsal and got to enjoy this perfume all morning - and it was very enjoyable! This one feels very ""classic Nui Cobalt fall scent"", especially reminding me of the vibes of¬†**Ouija Board** and¬†**Tasseomancy**¬†(see below). Here were my guesses about its notes: I definitely got the dark purple floral of the violets, so dark it practically went towards berry - I was guessing blackberry or blackcurrant, so I was right on the money there with the cassis note. I also get a strong, dusty incense note like that of¬†**Ouija Board**, which I guess must be the combination of patch and myrrh. In fact,¬†**Oubliette**¬†has some similarities to¬†**Alkemia Blackberry Noir**¬†\[A delicious, dark trinity - black berries, black tea, and sweet black musk\]. My other guess for this perfume's notes was oud, and again I'm spot-on given that agarwood is another name for oud. This is a super cool violet-blackberry-incense-oud scent that is so perfectly fall-ish, and I'm here for it. It also lasts a ridiculously long time, a whole day when most NCDs are about half a day on me. Definitely the other standout of the 2023 new releases.

**Ouija Board**¬†\[Aged cedar and teakwood, the glow of a dozen beeswax candles, incense drifting in the shadows of a dusty attic\] - It goes on as headshoppy nag champa, then quickly becomes root beer/cola-ish frankincense (and in truth I don't really like either of these early stages), but then it settles into the cathedral incense we know and love from¬†**Gargoyle**¬†\[Rain-drenched lavender, cathedral incense, beeswax candles, and ancient stone\] and¬†**The Mentor**¬†\[Ancient sandalwood, well-worn linen, olive leaf, oakmoss, Earl Grey tea, and sacred temple incense\], against a very dusty background (""dusty attic"" feels exactly right). In the drydown, a vanillic beeswax emerges, offering just enough sweetness to really smooth and round out the scent.

**Pale as Death**¬†\[Funeral lilies, datura accord, luna moths on cotton flowers, and white clover along a graveyard path\] - This one is so pretty and so¬†*clean*. It smells ""white,"" but not a¬†*flat*¬†white, a complex white with depth and richness to it, some shadows and texture. It is primarily that wonderful Nui Cobalt cotton flower note, but unlike in the Spidersilks, this is cotton flower without any added sweetness. Instead, it is paired with a soft, furred musk (the ""luna moths""?) and perhaps the faintest hint of the grassy almost-floral of the clover. To my surprise, I don't smell lilies, or any other floral, at all. My closest match is their¬†**Roll Initiative**¬†\[Egyptian cotton, pale driftwood, white pepper, green cardamom, and a slender wisp of copal smoke\], which is also mostly cotton without any sugar or vanilla. However, I could never find the right situation to wear it - I tried it in a couple of different seasons and it was never quite right for me - so I ended up destashing it.

**The Poisoner's Garden**¬†\[Benign accords of datura, wormwood, deadly nightshade, and autumn crocus infused with green peppercorn and dark, loamy musk\] - In the vial it's all bitter herbs (just sniffing it, I was sure I wouldn't like this one), but on my skin it blossoms into a really beautiful bouquet of white and green florals (I especially get a distinct gardenia), with no indoles but just velvety petals and wafting scent, and a bit of an earthy bite from the peppercorn and dirt notes. Too much dirt for me, in truth, but I know a lot of folks really like soil notes, so if that's you, definitely give this a try.

**Potion Craft 101**¬†\[Top notes of green mandarin and chilled seltzer water. A heart of calla lily, nicotiana flower, and candied tamarind. Base notes of fir balsam, liatrix, and teal musk\] - In the vial, I could swear I was smelling apples and stone, and was surprised how similar it was to¬†**Cemetery Soiree**. But on my skin, the notes become more clear: definitely citrus and evergreen trees, plus fizzy mineral water (that's the stone I was smelling), with a mild floral-tobacco base. It's an interesting combination I haven't smelled before. If it were¬†*just*¬†citrus and trees, it would be a winter (holiday) scent for me, but this one works as an autumn scent because of the extra flair, and despite not having any of the stereotypical autumn notes (pumpkins, pumpkin spice, chai, incense, dirt, golden amber, etc).

**Pumpkinocalypse**¬†\[Perfectly baked pumpkin pie, still warm from the oven and garnished with nasturtium flowers\] - Nui Cobalt's pumpkin note usually reads to my nose as quite vegetal, a pumpkin gourd fresh from the garden, rather than the creamy, almost sandalwood quality of the pumpkin from some other houses. That vegetal quality is quite welcome here - when I first applied¬†**Pumpkinocalypse**¬†and got a burst of buttery pie crust I thought, oh no, this one would be too gourmand for me. But after a moment the ""pumpkin"" part of the ""pumpkin pie"" takes over. This is a sibling to¬†**Squash Blossom**¬†\[Cocobolo wood, orris root, carrot seed, sunflower petals, mandarin zest, and acorn squash baked with brown sugar\] with its similar mix of vegetal squash and florals, though here it's a thicker floral with a sort of red-musky mellowness. This pairing of pumpkin and floral *could* have been really similar to¬†**Poesie Thrushcross Grange**¬†\[Creamy pumpkin flesh & soft vanilla creme, caramelized sugar, a faded whisper of honeysuckle\], but it's actually not at all similar.¬†**Pumpkinocalypse**¬†has basically no sweetness, the pumpkin is vegetal rather than creamy, and the florals are also completely different. This being said, between¬†**Squash Blossom**¬†and¬†**Thrushcross Grange**¬†I had these roles filled in my perfume collection, so I destashed this one.

**Purple People Eater**¬†\[Candied violets, blackberry bramble, kudzu vine, vanilla bean, ginger, star anise, and marshmallow fluff\] - It goes on with a blast of MAPLE, then within a matter of moments, the once-shy candied violets emerge and the spread to fill the entire perfume. It becomes a deeply purple perfume: candied violets with a strong maple undertone, but enough gentle woody elements to keep it from being too much like sugary candy. If I sniff my wrist up close, I can find the ginger, anise, and vanilla (in that order), but those notes aren't really obvious from farther away. In fact, this perfume reminds of nothing so much as¬†**Hive in the Wild**¬†\[Budding maple trees beside a swift stream, snowdrops nodding over vernal pools, and dewy dogwoods offer a trove of nectar to fill a fledgeling hive\] from the Bees collection, which is interesting because the two don't share many notes, but given the intense mapley-ness of¬†**Purple People Eater**, they end up sharing a combination of maple + floral + a woody/viney aspect.

**Rudiments of Augury**¬†\[Egyptian amber, loose-leaf tea, antique book shelves, obsidian musk, and a tendril of woodsmoke\] - I'm getting, in order of prominence, the warm, enveloping golden glow of Egyptian musk; a thick cozy cashmere (interesting, I wonder where that's coming from since cashmere isn't listed in the notes), and a smoky oolong-style black tea. Because it has all these cozy notes but not a single drop of sweetness, it actually reminds me quite a bit of¬†**Favorite Sweater**¬†\[White oak and blonde teakwood, copal resin, crushed coriander, lamb's wool accord, a touch of creamy chai, and a spritz of green mandarin\]. For me, though, it feels like it's missing something - a drop of honey, perhaps (or am I just trying to turn it into¬†**Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy**¬†\[Portrait of an extraterrestrial desert and its elusive denizens: dry white sandalwood, Tunisian tea, cracked coriander, cassia bark, amber resin, raw cotton, and combs full of precious honey that few will ever taste\]?), or maybe a tonka base. But if you prefer cozy but unsweet snuggly scents, this one is for you!

**Secret Staircase**¬†\[Top notes of green fig and Persian lime, a heart of ancient suede, sandalwood, and weathered teak, and a base of darkest patchouli, dry vanilla, and oudh\] - Bright lime and a super autumnal mix of suede, patchouli, and vanilla. It's quite an earthy, musky scent, but it's not aggressive, more plush than anything else, and the vanilla sweetens it in a really beautiful way, similar to¬†**Awaken the Witch**¬†(see above), actually, which remains my favorite patch-forward perfume.

**Sinister Mist**¬†\[Young teakwood, fresh cut leaves of eucalyptus and spearmint, a scant twist of lime, copal smoke clinging to cashmere, dry white vanilla, and chilled crepuscular musk\] -It's eucalyptus and mint, with a powdery undertone that my husband likens to Necco wafers. There's something genuinely sinister rather than spa-like about this, or perhaps just ""cold""-smelling.

**Skele-Cat**¬†\[Fossilized amber resin, the palest suede, dessicated orris root, porcelain musk, and a sprinkle of powdered sugar\] - Nui Cobalt has a truly lovely white amber note, cool and glassy (see also¬†**Ghost Cat**¬†\[Cashmere, white amber, and ethereal ivory musk with blushing peony and pink peppercorn toe beans\] and especially¬†**Mirror**¬†\[Pale amber and white tea are accented by dry coconut, angelica, and cooling rain\]). Here the inherent quiet sweetness of white amber is amped a little with the powdered sugar, and while it's primarily a white amber-forward scent,¬†**Skele-Cat**¬†is accented with pearl musk (to my nose, it's actually closer to the pearl musk of¬†**Cancer**,¬†**Grace**, and¬†**Akhal-Teke**, rather than the ""porcelain musk"" listed in¬†**Beauty & the Stockholm Syndrome Support Group**¬†or¬†**The Star**), and an absolutely¬†*gorgeous*¬†soft smooth suede. Story time: this scent makes me feel like I'm going to a funeral (which I suppose works, given the name ""Skele-Cat""), but not in a morbid way. I'm a professional classical soprano and I sing a lot of funerals (it's a real joy and honor of my profession, being able to bring some beauty to the occasion for the friends and family). Shortly after I started my indie perfume hobby, I made a habit of wearing a white amber scent with my black dress whenever I sang a funeral; for the longest time it was typically¬†**Hexennacht Apparition**¬†\[Spectral amber, alabaster vanilla, bone-white woods\].¬†**Skele-Cat**¬†is technically suede instead of woods, but it reminds me so much of¬†**Apparition**, which I ran out of a while ago, and it instantly became my new go-to funeral gig scent.

**So Wyrd**¬†\[Immaculate frankincense accented with deep amber resin, young tangerine, benzoin, solar musk, and the subtlest hint of flowering rosemary\] - Like Nui Cobalt's sun-themed perfumes (read my comparative reviews¬†[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/vp2a5z/here_comes_the_sun_a_comparative_review_of_3/)), this features warm amber, frankincense, and orange citrus, but without the sharpness of ginger that's typically present in the sun scents. Instead, this one has a fairly prominent rosemary, which gives it an herbal savoriness. Something about the amber + rosemary is, oddly enough, giving me almost apple vibes, plus the frankincense reads somewhat like cinnamon, so my nose is confusingly also getting an apple cinnamon note to this one. Then Husband sniffed it on my wrist and immediately adopted this one, so it's his now! (He does not get¬†*any*¬†apple so I'm honestly not sure where my nose is at in regards to this one. I'm glad he likes it!)

**Tasseomancy**¬†\[Black tea spritzed with orange, decades of incense smoke clinging to heavy velvet curtains, fireplace embers, cinnamon, and clove\] - Nui Cobalt does really phenomenal tea notes - see for example¬†**Blarney (Irish Breakfast Tea)**¬†\[The warm, tannic comfort of a proper Cuppa sweetened with a touch of raw honey and smoothed with fresh cream\] being my favorite, but also¬†**Cheat Code**¬†\[Windswept teakwood, cedar, coriander and tea are grounded in black tonka with a hint of fine leather\] and¬†**Wretched Hive of Scum & Villainy**¬†\[Portrait of an extraterrestrial desert and its elusive denizens: dry white sandalwood, Tunisian tea, cracked coriander, cassia bark, amber resin, raw cotton, and combs full of precious honey that few will ever taste\];¬†**Unbought & Unbossed: A Tribute to Shirley Chisholm**¬†\[The fragrance inspired by her is a strong and sophisticated spiced tea with raw honey and Barbados sugar sipped among the sunlit roses of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden\], my favorite tea-in-summer scent; and¬†**Cloak of Evergreens**¬†\[Snow-covered spruce, iced cedar tips, golden pine sap, icicle musk, and the fading memory of tea by the fireside\], my favorite tea-in-winter scent. And¬†**Tasseomancy**¬†is my favorite tea-in-autumn scent!¬†**Tasseomancy**¬†is black tea first and foremost, with a burst of orange citrus for vibrancy, and the ""fireplace embers"" making it feel like a smoky black tea, such as a lapsang souchong (rather than feeling more atmospheric, like ""drinking tea outside by a fire""). The incense, spice, and velvet notes make this a darker and heavier scent, one I won't wear outside of fall, but my goodness is it perfect for the autumnal season.

**Vengeful Spirit**¬†\[A screeching spectre of diaphanous cotton flower, cardamom, cashmere, bitter almond, storm-washed teak, and white sandalwood\] - I really think this one was misnamed, especially the ""Wear this‚Ä¶"" part of its notes description: ""Wear to invoke the fury of the Unseen to exact swift justice upon the guilty."" There's nothing vengeful or screechy or furious about it. I adore Nui Cobalt's fabric notes, and this scent has not one but¬†*two*: a slightly soapy cotton flower and a surprisingly not-cuddly cashmere. I don't really get any of the other notes (cardamom, bitter almond, teak, sandalwood) on their own - it's a really well-blended scent - but together they combine to create a stunningly sophisticated scent that feels expensive and a little standoffish. I think this discontinued scent was an overlooked beauty and I hope it comes back some day.

# Spidersilk Variants

\[Wow - this post got so long I couldn't post it because it exceeded the maximum character count! So I'll drop in all my Spidersilk variant reviews into a comment below.\]

# Personally...

For me the must-haves are¬†**Awaken the Witch**¬†and **Mourning Veil** (both of which are now discontinued - consider this a plea to the universe that they come back so I can push them on all of you!),¬†**Bibliomancy**, **The Headmistress**, and¬†**Mesonoxian**. Just¬†*spectacular*¬†scents!

Other staples of my fall collection are¬†**Ghost Train**,¬†**Pumpkins & Spidersilk**, **Ouija Board**,¬†**Tasseomancy**,¬†and **Oubliette**, all of which are so fabulously autumnal; plus **Exorcised** for that transitional period from fall into winter.¬†**Glass Pumpkin**¬†and¬†**Mad Scientist**¬†are also really cool, unusual, and worth experiencing.

**Vengeful Spirit**¬†and **Skele-Cat** for elegance and sophistication (I keep forgetting how much I like them; this is a good reminder to pull them out again!).

As for Spidersilk variants, I think the prettiest of them all are¬†**Dewdrops**, **Sunrise**, and **Twilight**, and of course I adore¬†**Incense**, with an honorable mention to the dearly-departed¬†**Shadow**.

Finally, there are a few discontinued Autumn 2s that I never got to try and I'm dying to--here's hoping that¬†**Crystal Ball**¬†\[White lotus, sacred sandalwood, and artemesia\],¬†**Lantern Light**¬†\[Honey amber and Meyer lemon illuminate dark Ceylon tea, ebony wood, and black tonka bean\], and¬†**Blue Moon on Samhain**¬†\[Smooth driftwood glistening with sea salt, pearl gardenia, oat milk, coconut flesh, forget-me-not, neroli, and a trace of lavender\] might ever come back - don't they sound¬†*so pretty*?! (If you have any of these and are destashing, please send me a message!)

Who else can't wait for the newsletter to come out tomorrow? Any guesses or hopes for this year's new releases?",9,1758732050.0,Indiemakeupandmore,5,0.85,False
1nph4j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/reptilians/comments/1nph4j6/question_for_believersencounter_with_reptilian/,"Question for believers/Encounter with ""Reptilian Hunters""","A few years ago I met a middle aged couple who were completely and utterly convinced of reptilians' existence. Here's how it went:

I was doing Missionary work at the time. My friend and I saw them on a ward directory and noticed they hadn't been to church in some time, so we thought we'd visit and see how they were doing. We showed up to their apartment, buzzed their number and explained why we were there. They invited my friend and I into their home, and the conversation quickly turned conspiratorial. They had a complete lack of trust in the government as a whole, except Trump. They believed they were in email communication with Trump and he was sent to save the world from reptilians. I asked them how they learned this and they explained there was some kind of website that few people know about where these updates get posted, which is how they got ""Trump's"" email. 

I'm not going to lie, at this point I was smiling ear to ear and holding back laughter because I had heard about the reptilian theory before I met them and had laughed about it with my Dad. My friend had absolutely no idea what was going on and started to feel scared by this point. 

I started egging them on because I found it entertaining at first, but it quickly got creepy. 

I noticed that every set of eyes in the house, apart from their own (obviously), were scratched out. So newspapers on the coffee table, product boxes from the store, even the cat food bag next to me had the eyes scratched out. I asked them about it and they said its because they were being ""watched"" and had to ensure there were no eyes left to be seen through. She described a situation where she had a photo of her sister on her bedroom wall and she watched one day as the smile in the photo stretched out until there was no more room on the photo. 

At this point I began to feel scared. It didn't feel lighthearted anymore, I realized these people truly believed what they were telling me. They even started to tell me that they believed they were called of God to hunt the reptilians and kill them, and they have encountered many throughout the last few years. 

Honestly not sure what to make of that whole situation. Years later I still have so many questions. 

Does anyone know about that website with the reptilian updates? I've always been curious. Or, is it common within the reptilian community to scratch out eyes on everything you own for fear of being watched, or was that a separate thing? Lastly, where does the idea of Trump being the Savior of the world come in?

The lore got so deep and I could share more of what they said if people are interested as we were there for hours, but I'll leave it here as this seems sufficient for the questions I have. ",5,1758732025.0,reptilians,4,1.0,False
1nph4it,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1nph4it/ben_and_ant_begin_part_3/,Ben and Ant begin part 3,"A month later and Ben felt completely different. Therapy and changing his routine had helped. He stayed in most nights, this had meant that some of his friends had dropped off, they sent texts to check up on him but they were losing the things they had in common. It was lonely at first but he had started to find peace in pulling bBy that afternoon when Ant clocked out she finally got a reply. His address. Ant texted the sitter that she had a short notice errand and drove there when she left the parking lot. It was an apartment building, she texted that she was there and set to look for his apartment number. She found it on the 3rd floor towards the back. Ant knocked on the door before she could reconsider. Suddenly wondering if this was a good idea. She trusted him because she had done the reading last night and hadn‚Äôt felt anything malicious but now it seemed like she was being incredibly stupid.¬†



He answered, bags under his eyes. He had obviously been crying.¬†



‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù Ant asked, she walked in without being invited and looked around, there were a couple beer bottles on the coffee table that she picked up and threw away. There were a lot¬† more -in the trash can.¬†

‚ÄúYou were right. Last night you were right. I‚Äôm freaking out. I can‚Äôt make it make sense in my head you know? It wasn‚Äôt even you, it was your kid. Your kid told me my mom wasn‚Äôt my mom. Like I could see you guessing the break up stuff but hwo would you know about my mom?‚Äù Ben sounded manic and Ant led him to the couch to sit him down. She held his hand and tried to hodl it tight enough to ground him.

‚ÄúI could have found out the break up stuff just by gossip right? But the stuff about your family, that was something you didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Ant said, affirming him.¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know how anyone could have. Certainly not some kid right? So unless somehow you knew and told him to say that, but you‚Äôd have to be a shitty mom to do that right? You aren‚Äôt a shitty mom are you?‚Äù Ben looked like he hoped that Ant would say she was a bad mom, but she didn‚Äôt.¬†

‚ÄúNope, just a regular one, doing my best and I keep my kids out of that stuff. They‚Äôre sensitive too. I didn‚Äôt encourage it because I didn‚Äôt believe in any of this before.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo then it‚Äôs real. Not some vague horoscope saying don‚Äôt go outside today. It‚Äôs just this real thing and it means something. Do I have to go to church now?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go to church. I‚Äôm spiritual but I don‚Äôt follow any religion per se. You don‚Äôt have to do anything you don‚Äôt want to do. You don‚Äôt even have to listen to me, although I would really like to insist on it. There can‚Äôt be any harm in letting an ex go.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI turned my phone off when I bought the alcohol last night. I didn‚Äôt want to get drunk and freak out on her. If I‚Äôm essentially stalking her now, I can‚Äôt imagine what a phone call like that would do.‚Äù Ben slumped down as if slowly deflating.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really good. I assume it worked?‚Äù Ant was half afraid it had occurred to him while drunk to turn his phone back on.

‚ÄúYeah, I just drank and cried about a mom I can‚Äôt remember and feeling like my whole life is a lie.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDid she die?‚Äù Ant asked, confused.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, she could be I guess. She disappeared when I was a really little baby I guess. My mom now came in while I was little so they just never told me. Dad‚Äôs been texting me all day. My mom texted me once. She‚Äôs worried I hate her. I haven‚Äôt answered. I don‚Äôt hate her, but I don‚Äôt know how to process this.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to process this all at once. It takes time. Have you checked for a therapist or anything? It sounds ike you really need one.‚Äù Ant rubbed his back and got him to lean back.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I took your advice and made it for Friday at 5, I told them what happened and they got me through to someone who could fit me in pretty fast. I was still crying then. They asked if I was suicidal like twenty times.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI might suggest leaving out that a psychic told you, I mean you can but they might think you‚Äôre crazy.‚Äù Ant got up and got him a gatorade from the fridge. He chugged it noisily making Ant gag a little.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never done that before?‚Äù Ben finally said, staring at her with a sort of awe.

‚ÄúI have for myself but I never really looked for confirmation. I just trusted that I was right. It‚Äôs a whole thing. But I don‚Äôt particularly find myself wanting to do that so I would prefer you didn‚Äôt advertise what I did for you. Also, I‚Äôm like legit terrified I broke you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou might have.But I needed to know obviously. Thank you, I know I‚Äôm a wreck right now but I really appreciate it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDid you find out about the aunt then?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask honestly. I was so shocked when they confirmed it that it slipped my mind.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair. Listen, when I finally got a sign like that, it turned my entire world over. I was spinning for weeks trying to make sense out of a world I thought I knew, it being so different all of a sudden. All of the magic I said there was, suddenly was real. I lost that safety of being able to walk away when it didn‚Äôt suit me anymore. There‚Äôs no going back. I really relied on normalcy in my routine. Going to work, talking to a therapist to make sure I wasn‚Äôt losing touch with reality altogether. These fears are normal but this won‚Äôt hurt you. You have to get outside and breathe. Leaarn how to ground yourself. You will adapt, I can feel that. I sense that you‚Äôre going to be ok through this,‚Äù Ant reassured him, she looked in his eyes and tried to soothe him telepathically. It seemed to be working.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre patronizing me. I know you are and it‚Äôs still working.‚Äù Ben finally said, he took in a sharp breath like a sob had caught in his chest. Ant hugged him tightly in a maternal way. Being careful to give out maternal vibes. ‚ÄúThanks I needed that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to get home and get my kids now, are you going to be ok?‚Äù Ant wasn‚Äôt sure if she should leave but she really couldn‚Äôt stay.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll be ok. I‚Äôm not going out tonight. I‚Äôll take a shower and take melatonin or something to knock me out. I‚Äôll feel better when I sleep I think.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSleep is a very good idea. Drinking is not. I know it hurts but you have to let yourself process this without trying to numb it so much. Let it flow. Which is easy for me to say, but I‚Äôm serious.‚Äù¬†



Ben watched her leave and went to the bathroom. He looked at his face and shuddered. He cleaned himself in the shower and then sat on the floor of the shower and let the water run over him until it went cold. He had wokenn up late and thought that he‚Äôd have trouble sleeping but by the time he was out of the shower his body was exhausted from crying and he went to bed. He thought he was having a more extreme reaction than he needed to, but then again, he wasn‚Äôt sure how he was supposed to react. Tomorrow he would call his parents and tell them he was fine, then it was only one more day until he saw the therapist and he could work on that. It was just as he drifted off that he realized he hadn‚Äôt thought about Kate at all that day. He had thought about the break up but not her specifically. Maybe letting her go wasn‚Äôt that hard after all. He let out a half asleep laugh and drifted off. ack. Ant had stayed by his side, she let him join her and her kids on walks through the woods but was clear this was not a romantic relationship. Ben had talked to his mom and dad and assured them he wasn‚Äôt angry but some days he wasn‚Äôt sure if that was true or not. Ben wasn‚Äôt angry at the intention but was angry that he didn‚Äôt know half of who he was. His therapist was helping him come to terms with that but he was dragging his heels on reaching out. He had found the aunt Ant had mentioned on facebook but couldn‚Äôt bring himself to message her. Her page was private but there were public posts about his mom still being missing. She was still looking for information, still pushing the police to solve the case or something. Ant told him he would know when he was ready to do it and not to rush himself. She pushed him into yoga and meditation to ground himself. As far as Kate was concerned, therapy had helped him stop pursuing her. He still thought about her but it was getting easier to do that without getting upset. The therapist agreed with Ant that the relationship had taken a turn into addictive toxic behaviors and reminded him that he was chasing a relationship that hadn‚Äôt existed for a very long time if ever.¬†



Ben got off work in the middle of the week to see a message request from his aunt. HE looked at the preview, basically saying he had come across her people you may know and that he looked like his mom so much that she had investigated and found out who he was. There was a lot more but he would have to open the message to read it in it‚Äôs entirety. Ant caught up to him walking out to the parking lot, she was talking about someone she was frustrated with and glancing around to make sure they weren‚Äôt within ear shot. Ben had found that when you got close to her, she was actually very social and friendly. She came off as an introvert and reserved but it didn‚Äôt last long when she got comfortable. She was also pretty funny in a way that wasn‚Äôt direct, it came out of nowhere seemingly.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet, are you friends with her or something?‚Äù Ant asked elbowing him as they exited the building.¬†

‚ÄúNo, just distracted. That person I‚Äôve been thinking about messaging, messaged me an hour ago and I haven‚Äôt opened it yet.‚Äù Ben said as quietly as he could. Ant slowed and blinked.

‚ÄúShe found you then, are you upset about it?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot really, I mean I guess I knew she would, I‚Äôve been looking at her page long enough that I‚Äôm not really surprised my name showed up. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to leave my bubble of not knowing.‚Äù Ben admitted. He began glancing around to see who was close and if they looked distracted.

‚ÄúWhat do you want to do then? Ignore it or just wait until you get home to read it?‚Äù Ant was trying to be calm but he knew she was dying to find out what it said. Ant did not have the same emotional connection to it and while she was very supportive in him doing what he was comfortable with, she was impatient to see where it went. Ben appreciated that she wasn‚Äôt pushing him and wasn‚Äôt prying into the situation.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get to my car and read it there. I can‚Äôt wait to get home to read it, I want to see what it says. I‚Äôm not going to respond until I get home though.‚Äù¬†



They reached the point in the parking lot where they would part ways and Ant was biting her lip. A sign he had realized was her holding back what she wanted to say. Mulling over the best way to say it.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you later and tell you what happens, I promise.‚Äù Ben offered. For someone that had approached him with a family secret, she was very careful not to overstep with her friendship. Ben had seen her with other people at work and to anyone else, she seemed incredibly open and relaxed but he had gotten to know her well enough to see how guarded she was. How careful she was not to pry and look like she was getting involved where she wasn‚Äôt wanted. She was also good at deflecting questions on why she did that. Something about past boyfriends accusing her of being nosy. It gave her an air of mystery that she insisted was on purpose. The one time he had suggested it was a trauma response she‚Äôd gotten annoyed and told him to quit adding things she had to work through.¬†

Ant reached out for his hand and squeezed it, assured him she was a message away for moral support if he needed it and took off for her car, glancing at the clock on her phone to see how late she was making herself.¬†



Ben got in his car and turned it on to get the air moving. He watched other people from the building trickle out and take off. For some reason he felt like he should wait for the parking lot to empty more before he read it. Perhaps he was just stalling though and didn‚Äôt want to see what was there. Ant had helped him listen more to his inner voice and while he didn‚Äôt get the same nudges she did, he was starting to get a better grasp on his intuition and it was telling him that there was something there that he was going to have to deal with. Ben turned on some music and finally opened the message



*Ben, I‚Äôm Theresa Groutin. Your aunt on your mom‚Äôs side. I saw your name pop up in people you may know and the resemblance to your mom is so striking that I knew it was you right away. You won‚Äôt remember me more than likely, I haven‚Äôt seen you since you were about 2. I‚Äôve reached out to your father before in the past but he has been clear that he didn‚Äôt want to upset you by bringing up your mom. I don‚Äôt know what you know of her. I can assure you, she didn‚Äôt run away from you. Whatever your dad or grandma tell you, she loved you more than herself and never would have disappeared. I would love to meet with you and catch up. You don‚Äôt have to talk about your mom, just getting to know you would be enough for me. There‚Äôs not much left of our family, our dad died when me and your mom were in high school and our mom died a couple years back. The rest of the family is scattered all around but they would love news about you too if you wanted to meet them. I have plenty to tell you if you want to get ahold of me. I have kids that are younger than you, your cousins and I know your mom would have wanted you to meet them.*¬†



Ben read it a few times. He sent her a friend request but didn‚Äôt answer the message. He sent a message to Ant with a summary of the message. She said something back but he didn‚Äôt really read it. He drove home thinking about the message over and over. Wondering what he wanted to say back, if he wanted to meet her at all. Which was ridiculous. Of course he wanted to meet her. He did the worst case and best case scenario practice his therapist had taught him to get past the fear. He wondered if he should let his dad know that she had contacted him but he decided against it.¬†



He got home and made himself a snack and then sat on the couch and responded. He told her he had only recently learned about his mom and hadn‚Äôt looked into it much yet. The response was almost instant, Ben had a feeling she had already typed it up and was waiting for him to say something before she responded. She was damn near begging him to drive up and meet her, to see pictures of his mom. That caught Ben by surprise. He had seen a few looking through Theresa‚Äôs page but they were pictures on flyers looking for information. What Theresa had now were pictures of her pregnant with him, pictures of her as a little girl, pictures of her holding him.¬† She sent him one, a picture of a woman who looked like him, smiling and looking awestruck holding a red screaming baby. The picture quality wasn‚Äôt great but it felt like magic. Ben sat back and just examined it over and over. The situation was suddenly real again. He didn‚Äôt have the same sorrow over it, no big breakdown. But it was time to start really finding out who his mom was. Not preparing and gathering information like he had the last month. He picked his phone back up and Ant had sent a picture of the strength card from her tarot deck. Ben had an idea and messaged his aunt, asked where and when they could meet. She gave him an address of a diner and asked if he could meet this weekend. Ben asked Ant if she meant what she said about helping him. The response was slow, she knew when she was being trapped in something with him but 10 minutes later she said she did. He asked her to accompony him out of town to meet his aunt. That he wanted to get there the night before and stay in a motel and then meet her the next day so they had time to look around where his mom grew up. Ben reminded Ant that he knew she didn‚Äôt have the kids and promised to pay her for coming with him as his psychic friend. To see if she could pick anything up. Ant was again slow to respond but finally said ok, as long as it didn‚Äôt cost her anything she was agreeable. Ben could sense the annoyance through the phone, likely meaning she had pulled cards and they had already told her to accept. Ben was surprised to see her when she practiced. It was like the spirits were dragging a child behind them who complained the whole time, but if he asked why she didn‚Äôt just say no or not do it, she snapped at him that of course she was going to follow her intuition and listen to her guides. They were there to help. It was disrespectful not to. It gave him a great deal of satisfaction to point out where she was needing to do inner work when she resisted despite him not knowing anything about it. He pointed out when she was saying no because she was afraid of getting out of her comfort zone, she generally got mad at that but she always did the work. Sometimes there was a reluctant thank you he got out of it. It was a nice friendship that had come out of this. Being able to help her made him feel like they were on even ground. He thought maybe she felt that way too. Knowing her better now, he was much more aware of how hard it was to do the reading on him at the park. To tell him what she was receiving. Her trust in her own power was a fake it until you make it situation, she insisted she was so new to all of it herself but the only way to progress was to go forward and know that she was right. The girl that came off as so self assured and steadfast, was trying her hardest to actually be that person. Ben could relate to that and appreciated how hard he had to work in the last month to build trust with her.¬†

Ben responded to his aunt that he would be there with a friend. He debated telling her his friend was a psychic but decided against it. Maybe just see if he wanted to tell her first.¬†

Im a very introverted person with extroverted characteristics. When I feel comfortable, its over, I can win you over, I can make you laugh, I'm witty and I never run out of things to say.

When I was in uni people called me social genius, because I could talk to anyone and start conversations without even trying. It was like I was made for this. Not forced interactions no nothing. Sometimes i felt that I am to good to be true and I can say that without shame. Now god or whatever power from above took my gifts. Took away my charisma.

When i drunk coffee in the morning or after a good workout, i felt like I was INVINCIBLE.
The thing is and this is why I believe it is anhedonia and brain fog, that very frequently, even music ( and I'm a sucker for music, it makes me daydream) irritates me. It hurts my brain. I can not explain it otherwise.

The only thing that I believe that triggered that kind of mindset is the lack of interaction because I dont go to the uni ( but I interact with many people in my daily life) and with combination of stress which I dont know why I have it in such depth.

I used to be the joy of life and now I just act like it, instinctively, because I really dont know how to REALLY react.",1,1758731651.0,BrainFog,0,1.0,False

Together with Hannah in Freetown and Magnus in Kenema, we‚Äôve just planted 3,000 Coffea stenophylla saplings on a 7.4-acre farm in Sierra Leone.

Why it matters:

Arabica ‚Üí great taste, but fragile in heat

Robusta ‚Üí hardy, but not as good in the cup

Stenophylla ‚Üí rediscovered in Sierra Leone, combines quality close to arabica with resilience like robusta


What we‚Äôre doing:

Tagging and logging every plant with GPS + photos in KoboCollect

Running small trials with local farmers

Hoping for a first harvest in 3‚Äì4 years

Maybe you never thought you‚Äôd search for that, or maybe you considered it once finals hit. I‚Äôm the big brother here, so let me tell you what I wish I‚Äôd known back in college - and what I know now, after helping a few younger friends make smarter decisions about their workload.

https://preview.redd.it/q748xdk135rf1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=448d77907e558bdf547cdce09d1cc1c6a350a16a

Back in my day, we handled deadlines with coffee, panic, and sometimes a group project gone wrong. These days, the options are‚Ä¶ way better. You can actually get real help and keep your grades above water. But with so many sites out there, the right move takes a bit of digging.

**Why People Turn to Paper Writing Services**

You‚Äôre not lazy if you want someone to help out. Life gets busy. Family stuff, work, health, or maybe you just want a night to yourself - it‚Äôs all valid. When you think, ‚ÄúI need someone to write my paper for me,‚Äù you‚Äôre not alone. Lots of smart students do this for solid reasons:

‚Ä¢ Not enough hours in the day ‚Ä¢ Struggling with a tough topic or never had a good research process ‚Ä¢ Need to focus on other projects or work ‚Ä¢ Not sure about formatting, structure, or citations practices

Paying someone to write my paper isn‚Äôt about cutting corners. It‚Äôs about getting by (sometimes just barely, let‚Äôs be real). But not all services offer the same quality or security, so here‚Äôs what you need to know.

**How to Pick the Right Service**

If you‚Äôre typing out write my paper in the search bar, you‚Äôll get a flood of websites. The trick is sorting out what works for you:

Reliability - Are the writers actually qualified? Can you get your paper on time? Originality ‚Äì Plagiarism can ruin your semester. Any site you use should offer Turnitin-safe or verified plagiarism-free work. Formatting and Structure - If you need APA, MLA, or something else, they should handle it. Support ‚Äì If something goes south, is there a human to talk to? Money-Back or Revision Options ‚Äì Because sometimes professors are just extra picky.

Let‚Äôs break down a few options that stand out right now. Full honesty - I‚Äôve seen these used by real students, not just advertising.

1. [leoessays.com](https://leoessays.com/?rt=4yYYs5GW)

Why people check it out: ‚Ä¢ Simple process ‚Ä¢ Decent pricing for what you get ‚Ä¢ Real human support (big plus when your draft needs fine-tuning) ‚Ä¢ Plagiarism checks included If you‚Äôre the cautious type, you‚Äôll appreciate their upfront prices and reviews from actual students. There are often seasonal discounts too, so keep an eye out if you‚Äôre looking to stretch your student budget.

2. [speedypaper.net](https://speedypaper.net/?rt=ImkNTuab)

Why you might like them: ‚Ä¢ They can turn stuff around in a hurry (good for when you forgot‚Ä¶ again) ‚Ä¢ Decent for both high school and college assignments ‚Ä¢ Formatting, editing, and even help picking a topic The support is patient. One of my friends botched his word count and got it sorted in minutes.

3. [essaymarket.net](https://essaymarket.net/?rt=FgU6CgtF)

Why people try it: ‚Ä¢ Marketplace set-up‚Äîwriters bid, so you sometimes get a deal ‚Ä¢ You can pick a writer you click with ‚Ä¢ Lots of feedback, so you can check reputations Best if you want to see all your options and pick someone who matches your style.

4. [writepaperfor.me](https://write-paper-for-me.online/?rt=3blxfl9B)

What stands out: ‚Ä¢ Covers classic essays plus obscure stuff (like STEM projects) ‚Ä¢ Clear communication, quick draft delivery ‚Ä¢ Can handle tricky research requests with the right sources ‚Ä¢ Their citations are on point (even trickier ones)

**How to Use These Services Safely**

From my own experiences (and a few embarrassing moments I helped family through), here are my ground rules when you ask: will someone write my paper for me?

‚Ä¢ Always use your own instructions and course materials - the more info you give, the better the draft ‚Ä¢ Double-check the originality with your own tools if you‚Äôre nervous ‚Ä¢ Ask for revisions if something feels off ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt just submit it as-is. Read through, add your own voice, and make sure you‚Äôre covering what your professor actually wants

**Why Trust My Advice?**

I‚Äôve seen enough students stress about how to pay someone to write my paper to know you‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs not about taking the easy road - it‚Äôs about surviving school so you can do what matters to you. Just be smart about it. Ask questions, check reviews, and don‚Äôt hand over more info than you need to.

**Final Thoughts**

So, if the thought, ‚ÄúI need someone to write my paper for me‚Äù keeps circling in your head, you have choices. There‚Äôs no shame in getting some outside help. What matters is how you use it.

1npgsvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1npgsvx/in_1_year_and_7_months_i_lost_38_kg/,In 1 year and 7 months I lost 38 kg.,"Note: I translated it through a translator because the text is too complex for me to translate it myself. Sorry if there are any mistakes.

Hello, guys :)  I decided to share my story about OMAD/ADF.  I‚Äôm from Latvia, 33 years old female, 161 cm tall.

Starting weight: 95 kg (BMI = 37, February 2024), metabolic age according to the app ‚Äì 39 years.  
Today: 57.2 kg (BMI = 22.3, September 2025), metabolic age ‚Äì 33 years.  
Total lost: 37.8 kg in 1 year and 7 months.

¬†Today is my last fasting day on ADF.  
Starting from tomorrow I‚Äôm switching to OMAD because I‚Äôm losing weight too quickly (1.5-2kg/month), but I can‚Äôt eat more food in my ADF eating window (12 hours).  
I don‚Äôt want to end up too skinny with sagging skin.  
My ADF format was 12/36. On fasting days, I drank water, green tea, coffee, and if my stomach was growling, I ate carrots, cucumbers, cabbage.

¬†

**My story:**  
I‚Äôve always been overweight, starting in middle school. Poor family eating habits, junk food, sedentary lifestyle. I finished school at about 63 kg, and by the age of 32 my weight had gradually increased to 92‚Äì95 kg. Over the past 15‚Äì18 years, I‚Äôve tried countless times to lose weight. It never worked out, and the weight always came back, even more.  
In 2020, I managed to lose 20 kg on ADF + keto, but over New Year‚Äôs I gave in to tasty food, relapsed, and quickly gained it all back.

A year and a half ago (February 2024), I ended up in the hospital because of a lumbar disc protrusion and lumbar myofascial syndrome. While investigating the pain, I also got an X-ray that showed stage 2 osteoarthritis in my left hip joint. Later, I checked the right side too ‚Äì stage 1 there. I don‚Äôt know how at such a young age! Maybe from sitting too much, being overweight, maybe even the COVID vaccine.

Honestly, that broke me‚Ä¶ I cried for a couple of days, then got used to the idea. At the time, the doctor even prescribed me antidepressants. I read that osteoarthritis isn‚Äôt curable, but you can slow down its progression ‚Äì by reducing joint load (losing weight), doing special physio exercises, and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle.

After two weeks in the hospital, I got used to eating smaller meals more often. Returning back at home, I lost 6 kg and continued eating in that way, avoiding fast carbs and junk food. I don‚Äôt exactly remember how I was eating a year ago.

¬†¬†

**Now:**  
My ADF meals include foods I really enjoy and that keep me full, so I don‚Äôt even crave anything else: 100 g porridge cooked with hot water, 800 g of vegetable salad with olive oil, \~200 g of any meat + 2‚Äì3 eggs, 2 handfuls of nuts (pistachios and cashews), 15 g of dark chocolate (99‚Äì100%), 300‚Äì500 g kefir (from kefir grains), 500 g milk, cottage cheese pancakes, 3‚Äì5 mint candies.  
A couple of times a month, I let myself have some of my favorite junk food that I‚Äôll never give up ‚Äì Pringles, chocolate ice cream, glazed curd bars.

The hip exercises gradually turned into Pilates, not just for my legs, but my whole body, especially my abs. Now I have very strong abs. I NEVER in my life could do even one push-up in the classic form, only from my knees. But now, after losing weight and thanks to Pilates, once a week I do 3 sets of 10 regular push-ups. It‚Äôs hard, but I do it.

Three times a week I don‚Äôt do Pilates. On those days I walk 10‚Äì30k steps, which really helped burn calories (300‚Äì800 kcal/day).

¬†Sometimes my joint (left one) ache, but MUCH less than a year and a half ago.  
Overall, I feel great ‚Äì almost slim, with good muscle tone (abs, glutes, thighs, shoulders).  
I do have slightly sagging skin (stomach, thighs), especially visible when planking. My breast has shrunk and sagged too ‚Äì not terrible, but noticeable to me.  
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm switching to OMAD ‚Äì to slow my weight loss (currently \~1.5-2kg/month) down to max \~0.5 kg/month, build more muscle, eat more protein, and help my skin tighten.

¬†I really like the principle of intermittent fasting + healthy eating. Thanks to this, my skin is very ‚Äúclear‚Äù and healthy, it didn‚Äôt sag too much, and I feel light and in a good mood all the time. I was very afraid OMAD/ADF would give me gallstones, but so far I‚Äôve had no problems. I hope it stays that way.  
I‚Äôll keep eating the same as on ADF, but split the portions and add a little more.

¬†I just wanted to share my experience ‚Äì maybe it will inspire someone to start or continue their own weight loss journey.

¬†

Here is my weight change by month over the last 1 year 7 months.

Is this now platonic or something more?,"I (25M) haven‚Äôt talked to this guy, Dan (25M), in a year and a half. I was in a situationship with him around Jan 2024 to maybe May 2024 before we lost touch. I‚Äôm not sure how close he‚Äôd consider us, but we went out about a dozen times, either for lunches during work days, or dinner before sex. We usually also spent the entire day together after fucking ‚Äî he‚Äôd make me a meal or we‚Äôd go out to eat, work out, lay in the park, etc. He even took the train from DC to Baltimore for an evening/night when I was on a work trip there. We never hung around his friends or mine.

Three weeks ago, I hit him up to reconnect because someone brought him up in conversation. I asked if he wanted to cuddle and he said he couldn‚Äôt because he had a boyfriend and they were still ‚Äúfiguring it out,‚Äù but wanted to take me out to drinks or coffee. We spent two and a half hours together over drinks two weeks ago that Thursday, and when I told him over drinks that I was going home decor shopping, he suggested we go to an estate sale that Saturday. He also suggested we do other things like go to a rock climbing gym near where I live, because he had two guest passes. 

That Saturday, we spent the entire day together from 10:30-5pm, later working out together and eating lunch and going to a bookstore. After our workout he got completely naked in front of me (probably inches away from my face), which I found a little jarring considering he had a boyfriend. And after that day together he suggested we grab drinks the following week to chat about my new job. (He said he had to take a rain check because of work and we rescheduled to this Thursday.) 

What boggles my mind is that‚Äôs what we did during our situationship, just without the sex. The same bookstore. The same cafe for lunch. He always spends a lot of time with me the day after sex. He always has 20 plans he thinks we should do together ‚Äî always one on one. He even insisted on paying for drinks and bought the food for lunch, as he always had done with me.

We maybe went out at most a dozen times before we lost touch. And when we did, we maybe said stuff like ‚Äúwe should get together again‚Äù twice or three times. And for what it‚Äôs worth, he told me over lunch that Saturday that he was dating another guy since March. He also talked about his boyfriend a decent amount, about half the time when I brought him up. But in June, even after we hadn‚Äôt chatted much, he randomly sent a shirtless selfie to me on snapchat. Not sure if they were exclusive then.

We didn‚Äôt end things last year on a bad note. He was a great guy but I was too focused on getting my career off the ground. My entire life was work and I barely had room for friends nevertheless a bf. I‚Äôve gotten that mostly sorted out now, and am ready to date around. I would‚Äôve asked him out a few weeks ago if he was single. 

But I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs still interested in me like that. My friends (mostly straight since some have told me it matters) all say they get a weird vibe that‚Äôs not purely platonic but I‚Äôm not sure about this either way. On one hand he drew a clear boundary ‚Äî no intimate contact like cuddling. On another, he suggested we spend the day together. Why spend all this time with an old situationship after a year and a half of minimal contact? I wouldn‚Äôt have considered us super close friends for what it‚Äôs worth, considering we only saw each other around a dozen times.

And do I say something about this now, or wait and see how things evolve?

TLDR: I feel like I‚Äôm getting mixed signals from an old situationship who is in a relationship. I would‚Äôve asked him out if he was single. Can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm misinterpreting signs that he‚Äôs open to more.",0,1758731254.0,relationships,0,0.25,False

I have not yet really geeked out to this coffee stuff yet, and I know I am not using the best espresso maker. And I am using pre-ground coffee, though it is from one of the best roasters here in STL.

What I am working with: I have a pretty standard Mr. Coffee brand espresso maker, the one with one ""portafilter"" thing. The inside of the portafilter has two level line markings, the first one about halfway up marked with a ""2"". The other is almost at the top marked with a ""4"". I understand that these marking indicate the level of grounds needed to achieve 2 and 4 shots of espresso.

What I want to achieve: I want to pull 8oz of espresso, to then make Americanos, lattes, and even mochas. After some research it appears that each shot of espresso should be pulled with 1 oz of water, which seems very small to me.

What I have been doing: My current method is to load the portafilter up with grounds, even past the ""4"" mark. The difference between the ""4"" level marker and the top of the filter is minimal, and it seems to be brewing just fine. Ok, so then I am pouring in, and dont judge (!), 8oz of water. I pour in 8oz of water because I want 8oz of coffee to come out. From there I make Americanos, lattes or sometime mochas.

So if the 1oz of water to 1 shot of espresso is accurate, then I appear to be using double the amount of water needed for those 4 shots. The thing is, I am still getting good flavor. And when compared to those same drinks from legit baristas, they taste the same to me. Am I crazy? No fair answering that last question based off of my profile pic.

Ultimately I want 8oz of espresso, and around a 14-16oz drink after adding water or milk. Does that mean I need 8 shots? Isnt that way too much? Looking for guidance and recommendations. Thank you for reading. Any help is appreciated!",0,1758731233.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

National media headlines keep tearing it down.,"Las Vegas just kicked off its first ever citywide ‚ÄúFabulous 5-Day Sale,‚Äù a campaign meant to draw visitors back with deals on hotels, dining, and attractions.



But instead of celebrating, the city finds itself under attack in the national press... again. While we roll out promotions, the headlines pouring in are brutal. Major outlets are zeroing in on a simple fact: Vegas is just too expensive.



The New York Post story published yesterday warned travelers that a trip here could hurt your wallet ‚Äúbut not for the reason you‚Äôd expect.‚Äù They said in the article that the real house edge in Vegas isn‚Äôt at the blackjack table. It‚Äôs the bill when you order. It is the everyday basics: food and drinks, coffee, brunch, snacks.



Fox News described the city as a ‚Äúplayground for the affluent,‚Äù suggesting everyday travelers are being priced out. Yahoo piled on with a piece about ‚Äúdynamic pricing,‚Äù where a candy bar and a sports drink can cost $10 one day and $14 the next.



Vegas just cannot seem to catch a break. But why?



The Fabulous 5-Day Sale is supposed to show Vegas at its best, affordable and welcoming. Instead, it feels like a distraction from deeper problems.



Many are also asking where the restaurant deals are. If you visit the official Fabulous 5-Day Sale page, you will find plenty of hotel offers and yes, we wrote a piece about those. But under Food & Drink Specials there are only nine deals listed.



So why is Vegas under attack in the national press even during a citywide sales event that is supposed to promote affordability?



Some might think it is just a trend that started when ‚ÄúVegas is dead‚Äù went viral back in May. But it is not a trend. It is the reality we locals have been living for years.

Prices kept climbing, visitors spent less, and city leaders kept pretending that everything was fine.



Vegas is not dead. The city is simply being failed by our incompetent leaders. But what makes this place truly great has never been them. It is our visitors and us locals.

Hi Reddit,

I (25F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (27M) for the last 6 months. Before that, we were friends for about 3 months. Things started off okay, but recently, I feel mentally and emotionally drained. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting or if something is genuinely off here.

Some background:

He works in a well-paying government job. His work life is very chill ‚Äî minimal workload, maid takes care of all chores  and cooking at his flat.
I work in a private IT company. My job is stressful, the salary isn‚Äôt great, and I‚Äôm also studying for higher education after work.
We live in different cities, about 200 km apart, and meet twice a month (only in public places, not at each other‚Äôs flats).
I live alone and manage all cooking and house cleaning myself.


The issues:
From the beginning, he has had a tendency to overthink small things and stretch them out into major issues. I‚Äôve tried to calmly explain that I‚Äôm always willing to communicate and fix things, but he doesn‚Äôt let go easily.
For example, when we were still just friends, we met at a restaurant and I didn‚Äôt hold his hand or sit close to him ‚Äî because we were just friends at that time. He made it a huge issue for a week and said, ‚ÄúI have feelings for you, that‚Äôs why I argued.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think I did anything wrong, but I still apologized and tried to understand him.
Since then, we‚Äôve had multiple fights over very small things. Almost every month, there's some fight where he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm breaking up, I can‚Äôt go ahead with this.‚Äù But after a few days, he comes back, blames me for the issue, and says, ‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt done that, we could‚Äôve been happy.‚Äù Then he tells me he loves me and asks me not to repeat it again. This pattern has repeated 8-10 times in the last 6 months. I‚Äôve lost sleep, skipped meals, and even relied on 4‚Äì5 cups of coffee daily just to work at office.
2 weeks ago, we did have huge fight, it was very small topic but he said that was too sensitive for him. So two days I didn't do anything rather than solving issue. That fight affected my whole 1 week sleep. 


Most recent issue (last night):
Yesterday, I got free from work at 6:20 PM and went straight to the salon since it‚Äôs Festival and the salon closes by 7:30. I didn‚Äôt check my phone from 6:20 to around 8:45 PM because:
After the salon, I rushed back due to traffic.
The kitchen was a mess, so I cleaned it.
I ate something and watched one episode of Demon Slayer to unwind.
Went to buy veggies, got back, and only then I checked my phone and saw he had called.

I texted him ""Hi"", didn't call back and later messaged him a study question. He called me to help with the study topic. But around 11:45 PM, just as I was about to sleep, he brought up the missed call and got upset that I didn‚Äôt prioritize calling him back.
I explained everything calmly ‚Äî that I had work, went to the salon, did chores, and didn‚Äôt want to call earlier because I knew a small issue could turn into a big fight (as it often does). Still, he accused me "" Why you Prioritized salon, you don't respect me, all these were excused. Say Sorry Otherwise I will not talk."" 
I didn't say Sorry and asked what was wrong, still explained again. After explaining him multiple times and not being heard, I ended up screaming. I hate it when I lose control like that. I feel so guilty afterward. The screaming things happened like 3 to 4 times and now I feel Worry.

He has helped me a lot with studies, especially with math, He is always there when I need any help, he cares a lot sometimes and I do respect him deeply for that.  I love him too much, but emotionally, I feel like this behaviour is taking all my energy. I can't focus on office work as I‚Äôm sleep-deprived, and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening anymore.

She DV'd me and now has a TRO against her. TW: Verbal Abuse, DV, Restraining Orders","(Let me know if not allowed) 

I wish the title was just clickbait, because this has turned my whole world upside down. My (32F) now ex-girlfriend (27F) of 4 1/2 years has always been a relatively liberal person. She was obviously a member of the LGBT community, but two years ago, starting being extremely critical of the GBT portion of the community. That criticism slowly melted into vitriol. I would gently try to remind her, on an almost daily basis, that transgender folks aren't our enemy, but she framed it as your typical 'they're trying to erase what being a woman means'. Which always irked me, but she was the (supposed) love of my life. Her ideology continued to spiral downward, but she hid a lot of it from me. Which was quite easy; we were a long-distance relationship (she on the East Coast and me in the Southwest). She'd been visiting me for two week periods for the last three years, but was never on my lease. My mother and I are the only leaseholders. That will be important later.¬†

Fast forward to Friday of last week (9/12). We had plans to meet in Las Vegas (my mother and I drove from our home, and she flew in to Harry Reid). When I picked her up at the airport, I was even more excited than I usually was when I picked her up after a long period away from each other; we were all so excited for this trip. I'm a huge Fallout New Vegas fan, and the opportunity to see landmarks from the game and just enjoy Americana had me over the moon. Things were fine for a little while, about two hours. When we got back to our hotel (I splurged and got us a night at the Luxor, and it was beautiful), things got a little uncomfortable. My ex loves to smoke weed, something that I'd recently gotten into as well. It really does help my anxiety, but I'm hesitant to continue use after this situation, but that's beside the point. She asks if we can go out to smoke, which of course I was fine with. We head to the front of the hotel, but security quickly informs us we have to be a certain distance away from the building. Which is totally fine with me, as I'm a bit of stickler for rules like that. But she immediately begins griping about how people can walk around on the sidewalk with open beer cans and red solo cups. She's not a fan of alcohol, as her mother is a recovering alcoholic. This, too, will be important later. In this same vein, it's been seven months since I've quit drinking. I recognized that I was drinking in an incredibly unhealthy way, and since my own mother is also a recovered alcoholic (33 years sober!). I brushed it off, as she was usually mildly irritated by that kind of thing. In my mind, it's because the smell and the fact that technically, you make yourself other peoples problem when you smoke in crowded areas. Again, besides the point. We find a place in the employee parking lot, and she takes a seat on the curb. Mind you, my mother and I had woken up at 4 am to get on the road, as it's an 8 hour drive from our home to Las Vegas. My ex had woken up at noon and had also slept on the plane. She kept me out in that parking lot for a little over two hours, putting us well past midnight. In those two hours, she went on what could only be described as a rant about Charlie Kirk.¬†

Now, I'm not a big proponent of political violence...but there's no love lost for me. He was a condescending Evangelical. I have a minor hyper fixation on Evangelical Christianity, which will come into play later. But according to her, which seemed to come out of left field, he was a martyr. The last bastion of open discussion and freedom of speech. I thoroughly disagreed, but kept that to myself. She was incredibly fired up, and I chalked it up to the fact that she saw someone literally get shot on her Twitter timeline without warning. I was wrong.¬†

We finally got inside and went to bed, and I had trouble sleeping. I couldn't put my finger on what, but something had me worried. We woke early in the morning and packed up the car, heading off for the second leg of our three part trip; Carmel-by-the-sea. It's a bougie little seaside town in California, and I picked it for a very special reason; my mom's part of this trip was to drive to the Pacific Ocean, which she had never been to. I'm very close with my mom, as we survived an extremely abusive home together. I wanted to do something special for her, as we'd just gotten over another family issue. My ex spent the entire drive just RAMBLING about Kirk and Trump. Now, my mom HATES him (as do I, obviously, given the sub), but she was holding her tongue and giving my ex room to talk. However, whenever my mom would try to interject with a counterpoint (because at the same time, my ex was glorifying Kirk and saying she wanted to take up his mantle for debate...debates usually involve rebuttals, no?), my ex would cut her off and shout over her and tell her 'no, no, no!' My mom eventually got very snippy and tried to end the conversation, but my ex would bitch that 'freedom of speech was dead', and just keep going. Once we crossed the state line into California, my ex took a deep breath, and made Gavin Newsome her new target. Mom and I drowned her out, but by the time we got to the coast, the two of them were SHOUTING at each other because my mother was trying to drive, and my ex was telling her to disregard the GPS and just 'trust her' to get us to our bungalow. Yes, I splurged for $700 on two nights at the Carmel Resort Inn, and we had our own cute little casita.

Here's where things get even stickier; my ex has ADD, and was a couple days off of her medication. Something her doctor advised her to do (I think they call it a drug holiday?), and she said would be fine. Keep this in mind.¬†

The arguing continues the next day, and her attitude completely ruined our breakfast and our trip to the beach, the two things that were very important to me that my mother enjoyed. She tried her best, and still managed to have a good time. She's a trooper.¬† That night, when the arguments started to reach a fever pitch, I spoke up and said we should just head straight home and just stay in a hotel in Arizona to break up the drive back to the Southwest. Granted, we were supposed to go back to Las Vegas for two nights, so I could enjoy the sights and take everyone to the Titanic artifact exhibit at the Luxor. I'm one of those weirdos who's always been obsessed with the Titanic, ever since I first got my hands on that two-tape VHS set. I cancelled all of that, because I just couldn't handle what was happening and didn't want everyone to be at each others throats. I'm not saying this for pity, just context.¬†

We hit the road, and the fighting began again. At this point, I was exhausted. I hadn't slept well at all, and the tension was making me sick to my stomach. My ex came from a two-parent home (mother and father) while I had an extremely abusive father, whom we left when I was twelve. My mom has been a single mother ever since. Her topic of ranting this day was that kids are abused if they don't have a two parent home. My mother and I were both shellshocked. There was nothing we could say; if we tried to inject, she would once again shout over us, and say, 'no, no, no!'. This went on for approximately two hours.  
  
Now, the night before, my ex told me she booked us a double queen room at a Motel 6 in Bullshead, AZ. One double queen room. She was very specific about that. We get to the hotel, and the two of them were still going at it, my mom trying to defuse the situation the best she could, but my ex wasn't having it. She storms into the registration desk, and when the receptionist verified that we got a single king room, she lost it. I took over at this point, as I was a bit calmer, and asked if we could switch to a double queen room, which he was more than happy to do for us. My ex was standing right next to me. We got our key cards, and as soon as we're out in the parking lot, she lights into me. ""I wanted two separate rooms, but you just took over and starting talking and didn't even advocate for me! You knew I wanted two separate rooms, I don't want to sleep in the same room as your mother!"" Now, she never once told me she wanted separate rooms. She keeps ranting, not letting me get a word in edgewise, and then she just storms off to get a king room for 'us', so my mom can take the double queen. At this point, my mom is over it, and just gets her suitcase out of the car and goes to her room. When my ex comes back with 'our' new keycards, she lights into me again. ""You're in a relationship with ME, not your f--king mother! You always prioritize her happiness over mine, and that's NOT how partnerships work!"" This threw me for a loop, as we both have incredibly close relationships with her mom, and her mom's illnesses are the reason, as she put it, we can't just move in with each other. Of course I start crying, and she just berates me for 'emotionally manipulating her'. Again, I can't get a word in edgewise. We finally get up to our room, and I continue crying, and she yells at me to go 'sleep with your mommy if you want to be a cry baby'. She has NEVER treated me OR my mom like this. It was a complete 180 from how she'd been the last four years. I was shocked, and eventually caved and stopped crying. I tried to go to sleep, and she just keep waking me up every hour. This was the start of her not sleeping.¬†

We get up in the morning, and she makes a big show of going to my mom and giving her a big hug and apologizing, saying her and I talked everything over last night and everything was fine. I was still teary, and exhausted, and we had NOT spoken about anything the night before. Everything was, in fact, not fine at all. But I just got in the car and we managed to get back to my home without incident. This was Tuesday, 9/16. When we got home, things got SIGNIFICANTLY worse.¬†

We usually spent a few hours of the day on my patio, so she would smoke her weed and we could watch ours shows. That first night, we stayed on the patio from 8pm to 2am. And we didn't even finish a single episode, because she kept pausing it every few seconds to tell me a new reason our country was going to hell in a hand basket. She was arguing with me about religion (she's a Christian-leaning Catholic, and I'm an atheist, which was never a problem before), saying that she needed me to go to church with her. I gently reminded her that I'm not a believer, which I didn't think I would ever have to, and she looked at me like I had three heads. ""Exactly, we need to fix that."" I was floored, but gave noncommittal answers until she changed the subject. Which she did often. It wasn't until three days of this same behavior went by, that I realized she was manic.¬†

Between these incidents, I managed to get her doctor to E-Prescribe her her ADD medicine to the pharmacy that's connected to the hospital I work at (I'm a data analyst), and we'd picked them up already. They only had generic methylphenidate, and my ex always insisted that she needed to be on the name brand (Concerta). She'd been taking the medication for three days straight at this point, and it was back in her system. But, she claimed that the generic medicine wasn't hitting her (she'd been on the generic consistently for two years at this point), and that was causing her manic episodes.¬†

That Saturday (9/20), we decided to go out to Karaoke, something we both thoroughly enjoy. She wanted to drink, which was a little out of the ordinary, but I wanted her to have fun. She started pregaming, and was trying to guilt me into drinking. I had to continuously remind her that I wasn't drinking anymore at all, and she was getting frustrated. When we got to the bar, she was already halfway to drunk. She got herself another drink, and we signed up for some songs. Instead of singing along, she grabbed the mic and monologued over the backing track, talking about how awful our trip to Cali was and telling the crowd that she was 'her town's Charlie Kirk'. She embarrassed me so badly, and at the time, was telling everyone I was her weird sober girlfriend. When I finally got her home, she'd sobered up a bit, but was still talking a mile a minute and stayed up all night on the porch, insisting I stay out there with her. I did, for a bit. But eventually, I kept saying I was tired. She screamed at me to go to bed without her, and when I did, she kept coming into the doorway. She was muttering to herself, so I asked her who she was talking to. She told me she was talking to God. I brushed this off in my exhausted state, and tried to fall back asleep. She stayed out on the patio until the morning, and when my mom went out for her morning cigarette, my ex lit into her. It continued off and on all day, with my mom trying to calm her down (my mom worked in mental health for over 20 years, so she was being incredibly understanding). My ex screamed at her to let her take her car to get coffee. My mom stated that she didn't want my ex driving in the state she was in, and offered to drive her. My ex angrily agreed. According to my mother, my ex screamed at her the whole way there and the whole way back, and when they got home, my ex 'went for a walk' and told my mom to have me go after her. I did. What proceeded was a two hour long tear-down of the very fabric of my being. She stated the following about me:¬†

* I had emotionally and mentally manipulated her the entire time she'd been there
* I was a godless heathen
* I need to be her mommy and her partner, and put her first and take care of her like its my only job
* I need to get over my 'shyness' and f--k her
* I'm a liar
* I'm obsessed with my mother
* I never make room for her in my life¬†
* I've been screaming at her all week

She probably said other stuff, but at this point, I was so emotionally and physically exhausted that all I could do was stare at her. I finally got her back into the house, and the second she saw my mom, she started screaming. I finally snapped, and told her not to speak to my mother that way in our home. That's when all hell broke loose. She started going off and on to the patio, slamming the door, throwing stuff, getting in mine and my mom's faces. She was screaming things that didn't make logical sense, saying that my mother kidnapped her that morning because she was a control freak, demanding that she let my ex use her car, no questions asked. Called my mom a bitch. I finally shouted at her to leave. To pack her suitcase and leave. Her flight home isn't technically until 9/30, which will come into play. She immediately spirals, screaming and crying and frantically packing and unpacking her stuff. She calls her brother, who tried to calm her down and is seemingly used to this behavior from her. He speaks with my mom, telling her to 'please help my sister', but there was nothing we could do. She starts berating me, and I snapped again, shouting back at her that I wanted her gone. She took out her phone again and started recording me, trying to egg me on. She then got right in my face with it. We put her suitcase outside, and her brother called again and managed to coax her outside of our apartment. We swiftly locked the doors and called EMS, because she refused to leave and was screaming while she paced up and down the sidewalk. EMS finally came as did the police. I felt like my whole life had been flipped upside down. I have C-PTSD from my childhood, where screaming was the only thing I heard when my Father was home. When the police finally came in to speak with me, they informed me that they had to open a domestic violence case, and handed over a card with my case number. I was beside myself, completely disassociated. I gathered her jacket and a few of her things she'd left behind when she packed, and handed it to the officers, and told them that the suitcase outside was hers. They took everything and left. I blocked her on (seemingly) everything. I spent the whole night waking up in a cold sweat and crying.



¬†EMS took her, unfortunately, to the hospital I work for. Where psych holds are a mandatory 72hrs. The next day, Monday 9/22, around noon, I get an uber notification that she wanted me to follow her ride. Her ride from the hospital to my house. The hospital had released her after less than 24hrs. I immediately called the police, and they got here three minutes before she did. She started screaming at them (I stayed locked inside), saying that she was my wife, that she'd lived here for three years and was on the lease, and that all of the stuff inside was hers. The previous case was referenced, and they trespassed her from the property. She tried to fight them on it, screaming and hollering for over half an hour. Eventually, they left with her, taking her to a hotel on the other side of town. The officers urged me to get a temporary restraining order (TRO), so I had to call my boss crying (I was working remotely), and asked for the rest of the afternoon off to do so. My boss, who is amazing beyond words, even before this, told me it was no problem. My TRO was granted yesterday afternoon, and there hasn't been any sign of her. I'm unsure if she's gone home to Boston yet, so I'm walking on eggshells. I changed my door code, double lock my doors, and am terrified to take my dogs out.

TLDR: My ex girlfriend became a Trumper, became a verbally abusive, mentally unstable monster, and now has a domestic violence charge and a restraining order against her.¬†

1npgmgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1npgmgi/should_you_trust_the_best_furniture_repair_kit/,Should You Trust the Best Furniture Repair Kit Katzco Set 34,"Testing out the Katzco 609301172487 furniture repair kit has been quite an intriguing experience for me. As someone who enjoys DIY home improvement projects and minor refurbishments, getting my hands on this extensive kit was like stepping into a toolbox heaven. With its 34-piece collection featuring wood filler markers, wax sticks, a sharpener, brushes, and even a smoothing spatula, this kit provides an all-in-one solution for those pesky wood scratches and blemishes. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of how it performed in real use.

**Usability and Design**  
The first thing that caught my attention is how well-organized this kit is. Everything is bundled together into a compact package, which is convenient for storage. Each furniture touch-up marker is about 5.5 inches long, giving it a comfortable grip for precise application. I used the markers and wax sticks to fix scratches on a coffee table and my wooden bedpost, and the results were impressive. The application process felt seamless, almost as if I was coloring my way to rejuvenated furniture. The inclusion of a crayon sharpener and a spatula adds an extra layer of utility, allowing for detailed work and smooth finishes.

**Precise Repairs and Color Options**  
One of the kit's most standout features is its variety of colors. The mix includes white, black, maple, cherry, and more, which makes matching your wood furniture a breeze. I was able to blend colors effortlessly to find the perfect match for my antique oak dining table. The wood filler markers dried quickly, leaving no smudges or residue. My cousin, who borrowed the kit to restore her scuffed hardwood floors, commented how the colors blended naturally with her walnut finish. This kit has made even old furniture look well-maintained and rejuvenated.

**Highlights**  
- Comes with 8 furniture markers, 8 wax crayons, and brushes for detailed touch-ups  
- Quick-drying markers that ensure no leftover residue or sticky surfaces

**Durability and Material Quality**  
The high-quality materials used here are evident from the smooth results they produce. The wax crayons in particular performed exceptionally well on deeper gouges in wooden furniture, filling them in seamlessly and providing a polished finish. I tried this on a wooden desk that had been a casualty of my nephew‚Äôs overzealous toy chest exploits, and I was genuinely surprised at how polished it looked afterward. The wax didn‚Äôt just fill the scratches but also matched the grain's appearance, rendering the imperfection nearly invisible.

**Target User and Versatility**  
Whether you're a homeowner hoping to extend the life of your furniture, a carpenter in need of a quick fix solution, or even an Airbnb host wanting to keep rental furniture in top-notch condition, this kit could serve a variety of user needs. I personally think it‚Äôs a must-have for anyone who deals with wood furniture on a regular basis. A friend who manages a small guesthouse recently told me they managed to salvage their floorboards‚Äô aesthetics without needing professional help‚Äîall thanks to this nifty kit.

**Areas for Improvement**  
While the kit is fantastic for general repairs, there are some hurdles to consider:  
- Matching certain intricate wood grains can be a bit of a trial-and-error process  
- Wax melts quickly if kept in warm conditions, making them harder to use  
- The markers run out fairly quickly if dealing with larger surfaces  

**Competing Products**  
When compared with products like the Rejuvenate Wood Furniture & Floor Repair Markers or Trade Secret Repair Kits, Katzco‚Äôs offering stands out due to its completeness. With both markers and wax included, I found it more versatile than the former. However, compared to Trade Secret's professional-grade performance, Katzco might lean more towards the DIY enthusiast rather than seasoned woodworkers. On the pricing front, Katzco offers solid value given the extensive tools included in the package.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its practical approach to wood repairs, this kit strikes a great price-to-quality ratio. I‚Äôve tried cheaper kits that either lacked durability or didn‚Äôt provide enough variety in colors, and pricier ones that didn‚Äôt feel much different. The Katzco kit provides enough for the everyday user without breaking the bank. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it for its cost-effectiveness and utility in prolonging the life of your furniture.

1npglso,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1npglso/delve_into_whether_febreze_antibacterial_fabric/,Delve Into Whether Febreze Antibacterial Fabric Refresher Works,"Initially, I was skeptical about trying the Febreze Antibacterial Fabric Refresher 16.9 oz. I‚Äôve encountered quite a few fabric fresheners that deliver inconsistent results, but this one swiftly stood out to me for all the right reasons. As someone who is obsessive about household cleanliness and often battles lingering odors, curiosity drove me to put it through its paces.  

**Design and Usability**  
The ergonomic design of the spray bottle caught my attention right away. It fits comfortably in hand, which makes tackling large surfaces less tiring. The trigger action produces a fine and even mist, crucial for proper fabric coverage without soaking the material. I appreciate the thought Febreze put into ensuring the bottle is user-friendly‚Äîit saved me from wrist fatigue, especially when I decided to use it on all my couch cushions, curtains, and rugs in one go.  

**Performance on Stubborn Odors**  
After spilling coffee on my office chair, I had doubts about whether a fabric refresher could combat the odor. To my amazement, this antibacterial fabric refresher didn‚Äôt just mask the smell; it completely eradicated it. Used it on gym bags and even on the backseat of my brother‚Äôs car, which hasn‚Äôt smelled decent in years, and it delivered. The antimicrobial formula is genuinely a lifesaver for someone managing spaces that are in heavy use.

**Good Aspects**  
- Eliminates odors instead of covering them up.  
- Antibacterial properties add an extra layer of cleaning.  
- Works effectively on a variety of fabrics like sofas, carpets, and car interiors.

**Fragrance Quality**  
This is where things get subjective, but for me, the fragrance strikes the perfect balance. It‚Äôs light enough not to overwhelm but present enough to leave a room smelling fresh. Unlike overly artificial scents from other products, this one has a clean, natural vibe‚Äîlike you just aired everything out on a crisp spring morning. My kids even noticed and asked why the living room smelled so ‚Äúnice.‚Äù  

**Negatives**  
- The 16.9 oz bottle can feel a little small for heavy users.  
- Works wonders on most fabrics, but I‚Äôd be cautious with overly delicate materials like silk‚Äîalways spot test.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking into alternatives, I considered one from Lysol, which boasts similar antibacterial properties. However, that product left noticeable residues on darker fabrics during my trial. Febreze's approach creates a balance‚Äîa great scent without pesky residue. I also tested Arm & Hammer‚Äôs pet odor eliminator, which was good for pet-specific smells but didn‚Äôt deliver as broad a use case. If versatility matters, Febreze takes the lead.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Admittedly, fabric refreshers aren‚Äôt the cheapest item in this category, but I feel this one is worth every cent for its performance. Compared to competitors, which either compromise on fragrance or leave behind residues, this option manages to walk the fine line of quality and practicality. Sprays last long enough to extend the time between deep cleanings, which means you‚Äôre getting value through efficiency.

1npgl4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalproductselling/comments/1npgl4l/forget_dropshipping_a_realistic_roadmap_to/,Forget Dropshipping: A Realistic Roadmap to Building AI-Powered Passive Income Streams,"Hey everyone,

I've been deep in the trenches of the ""passive income"" world for years, and let's be honest: most advice is garbage. It's either ""start a YouTube channel"" (which is incredibly active work) or some shady scheme.

But recently, the game has completely changed because of AI. I'm not talking about using ChatGPT to write a single blog post. I'm talking about building systems that, once set up, can generate revenue with minimal daily intervention. This isn't magic; it's about leveraging new tools to automate the valuable parts of a business.

I want to break down the core philosophy and a practical roadmap. This is a deep dive, so grab a coffee.

# The Core Mindset Shift: Architect, Not Laborer

The goal is to stop trading time for money. Instead, you become an¬†**architect of systems**. AI is your construction crew. Your job is to design the blueprint and manage the process, not to lay every brick yourself.

**The ""Passive"" Part is a Lie (At First):**¬†Every successful passive income stream requires significant upfront work. The difference with AI is that it drastically reduces that upfront time and, more importantly, the¬†*ongoing*¬†maintenance.

# The Roadmap: From Zero to (Truly) Passive

# Phase 1: Skill Stacking & Ideation (Weeks 1-2)

You don't need to be an expert, but you need to be proficient.

* **Learn the Tools:**¬†Get comfortable with:
   * **Large Language Models (LLMs):**¬†ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. Learn prompt engineering. It's the single most important skill. Don't just ask for a blog post; ask for an outline, then a first draft, then to rewrite it in a different tone.
   * **Generative AI:**¬†Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion for creating images, designs, and media.
   * **Automation:**¬†Make.com,¬†Zavier, or even Python scripts to connect different AI services.
* **Find Your Niche:**¬†The key is specificity. Instead of ""a blog about travel,"" think ""a newsletter and social media account focused solely on hidden-gem hiking trails in the Pacific Northwest, with AI-generated trail illustrations."" A narrow niche is easier to dominate and automate.

# Phase 2: Building Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (Weeks 3-6)

Choose one model and build a simple, automated version.

**Example 1: The Digital Product Empire**

* **Idea:**¬†Create and sell low-content books, planners, or printable art on Etsy/KDP.
* **AI's Role:**
   * **Midjourney/DALL-E:**¬†Generate unique cover art and interior illustrations.
   * **ChatGPT:**¬†Brainstorm book ideas, write blurbs, create filler content (e.g., prompts for a journal).
   * **Canva AI:**¬†Auto-generate layouts and designs.
* **The System:**¬†You create templates. AI generates 100 variations. You upload in bulk. The storefront is the automation.

**Example 2: The Affiliate Content Site**

* **Idea:**¬†A website that reviews products in your niche (e.g., ""Best AI Tools for Graphic Designers"").
* **AI's Role:**
   * **ChatGPT/Claude:**¬†Research product features, create first drafts of reviews, generate FAQ sections.
   * **Automation:**¬†Use a tool like¬†Make.com¬†to automatically post these drafts to your WordPress site and schedule them.
* **The System:**¬†You provide the core analysis and final edit (**CRUCIAL**¬†for quality), but AI handles 80% of the grunt work. The site gains SEO traction over time, bringing in passive affiliate clicks.

**Example 3: The Micro-SaaS or API**

* **Advanced but Powerful:**¬†Use AI to solve a very specific problem.
* **Idea:**¬†A web app that uses an AI API (like OpenAI's) to generate custom workout plans based on user-inputted goals and equipment.
* **AI's Role:**¬†The core functionality is the AI. Your job is to build the simple website (with a tool like¬†Bubble.io¬†or SoftArt) and the user interface.
* **The System:**¬†You charge a small subscription fee. Once built, it runs automatically.

# Phase 3: Automation & Scaling (Months 2-6+)

This is where it becomes passive.

* **Analytics:**¬†Use tools to track what's working. Double down on that.
* **Refine Prompts:**¬†Your prompts are your blueprints. The better they are, the less editing you have to do.
* **Reinvest:**¬†Use initial profits to pay for better AI tools, freelancers on Fiverr for final human touches, or advertising.

# The Hard Truths 

* **This is not zero effort.**¬†It's¬†less¬†effort for a scalable result.
* **Quality Control is Non-Negotiable.**¬†AI output is a first draft. You MUST add your unique perspective, fact-check, and edit. Spammy, unedited AI content will fail.
* **It's a Marathon.**¬†SEO takes time. Building an audience takes time. AI speeds it up, but it doesn't eliminate the waiting game.

# Final Thought

We are at the very beginning of this revolution. The people who will build real, lasting passive income are those who learn to be conductors of the AI orchestra, not just players of a single instrument.
