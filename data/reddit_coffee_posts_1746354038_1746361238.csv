Just signed up earlier this week while setting up my new laptop. I’ve mostly used free VPNs in the past like Windscribe and ProtonVPN, thanks to all the suggestions in free VPN Reddit threads but I was curious if this one would be any smoother since it’s coming from a trusted company.

Setup was super easy, and it connected instantly without needing any crazy settings. For basic browsing and email, it’s been totally fine. I also tested it on public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop and didn’t notice any speed issues. That said, it didn’t work with Netflix or Hulu, which was a little disappointing. And there’s not a ton of server locations compared to what I’m used to with other VPNs.

So now I’m kind of torn. For light use, it works. But if I want to stream or have more options, maybe it’s not enough. Anyone else tried Malwarebytes VPN lately? Is it worth keeping, or should I go back to one of the best free VPN picks instead? Would love to know what others think in 2025.",1,1746360739.0,VPNFreaks,0,1.0,False

I was up late last night practicing and then Lolita and I gabbed endlessly after her MFL show. This school had decided to break the Eliza Doolittle part between two actors. Lolita was the formidable “before” Eliza who took the part through “The Rain in Spain.” The student actress took over from “I Could Have Danced All Night.”  Lolita was so excited, as if she had never seen or done MFL before. Maybe she was imagining herself as Julie Andrews on opening night. 

At any rate, I went to bed ridiculously late. I was still planning on joining the East Bronx Roadrunners. I got up to make myself a cup of coffee but there was no coffee or Nespresso machine on the Thomas house counter. Whaaaat? *Both* broken? So I crossed into the Goldstein house and there was no coffee machine or Baretti there either. Instead there was a note from Mom and Dad: “You are burning your candle from both ends. Go back to sleep. We will go to 1:00 p.m. KRG instead of 10 a.m. We have already notified the Lopez and Yao families. They will meet us there. Go back to sleep!”

Oh, but what about Eulogio!?!? He's in town this week and we had planned to catch up before he headed out to travel back upstate. So I got on my phone to tell him. But there was already a note from him. “I heard your family is coming to the second KRG. I will stick around a bit and catch a later bus. I am looking forward to saying hi to you all!”

At any rate, I am so much looking forward to KRG. It seems forever since I have been able to make an activity! So I went back to sleep.

You know what? I am going back to bed!

# About me:

I am currently living in Bangalore. Luckily found this sub! I am a petite woman. I know English and Hindi. I am Vegetarian.

* Religion: Hindu (Definitely not looking for anyone religious as I am not a religious person. Not Atheist as I just believe in god. I don't mind an Atheist partner.)
* Ambivert, used to be extrovert but I think now I prefer being selectively extrovert. I love ""me"" time and prefer my personal space sometimes and would like to give my partner his space as well.
* I prefer someone straightforward in nature. I can't read minds so would prefer a partner who likes to communicate. Someone with an ego is a big no.
* Financially independent. I just don't like debt and want to keep my life that way.

Age preference: 29 to 33 (I am into huge age gap)

# Hobbies:

I would love to have a partner with some similar hobbies (at least one in common).

**Art**: I appreciate any medium of story telling be it theatre, movies and music. Some of my favourite movies/show in the recent time (so you get the idea of what I like): Sing sing and Boy and the heron. I love visiting museums!

**Gaming**: I am not a big time gamer just a casual one. But love my switch to death.

**Travelling**: I want to travel (India and abroad) and have a long list of places I want to visit. I am always looking for the hidden gems while travelling. I love exploring cities on foot (if that's feasible).

I love coffee & matcha (not enough to call myself an addict). I don't drink or smoke, I don't care about drinking (as long as they are not alcoholic) but can't stand smoker.I love animals.

I am not a romantic person (sorry if you are looking for a movie like romance) and sometimes feel overwhelmed by romantic gestures.

**Reason for CF**: I don't think I can give birth, the process is scary.

At the end of the day I am just looking for someone to vibe and spend my life with. I really believe in any relationship, it's important to have mutual respect.",6,1746360589.0,ChildfreeIndia,3,1.0,False

The offer was really meant for people sitting in the store but I would buy coffee in the morning and then bring my cup back around 1 or 2p for another cup. Apparently in NYC, they weren’t allowed to actually refill the cup for health code reasons or something. So they’d throw out the cup and give you a new one. That’s when I realized there was a loophole here. 

I kept five cups and brought them home. Then I started bringing one in the morning to Starbucks and I’d get a free “refill”. I’d do this every day and I’d end up with 5 gross paper Starbucks cups at work and then I’d bring them home on Friday and repeat the next week. I did this for months, not paying for coffee at all, until one day I brought in my cup and handed it to the barista for a refill only to realize that all of the cups behind the counter were different. It was getting close to the holidays and they’d switched to their holiday logo cups. Well, color me embarrassed. I started paying for coffee again after that. It was a good run though.

But sometimes you just need to chill the fuck out. 

Earlier this year, I was in deep burnout from a really stressful period at work, and I was so desperate to feel better thatI was trying everything. 

Fortunately, I had a four week vacation planned, and now, having returned to normal life, I can see in hindsight that I was just burning myself out more by trying to fix it. I didn’t start to feel better until I had time off, and I’ve been really conscious, now I’m back at work, to integrate more of that rest into my daily life. 

And honestly? I feel so much better after a Saturday spent sleeping in, and watching a movie, and walking the dog with my husband, than I did when I was getting up early for a 5km parkrun and then coffee with a friend and an afternoon tackling whatever project I had on. 

Of course, everyone is different. But I just wanted to put it out there in case there’s someone else who is struggling, and who resonates with that, and needs permission to call in sick at work or cancel their weekend plans or skip their run tomorrow.

A system promising to remove up to 99.999% of contaminants, including chlorine, VOCs, lead, and more? That sounded far too good to pass up. I’ve used this under-sink filtration system daily for a while now, and here’s my honest take on it. Spoiler alert: it's not perfect, but it does a decent job of making my tap water taste significantly better.

**Unboxing and Installation Experience**  
Setting this up was surprisingly straightforward for a product of its complexity. The package came complete with all the parts needed, including fittings, tubing, and a wrench. The video tutorials were clear and immensely helpful, especially for someone like me who tends to shy away from all things DIY. If you’ve got the right tools and some patience, you’ll have it installed in under an hour. I didn’t even need to call for professional help, which saved me extra money. Fitting snugly under the kitchen sink, its mini size means it doesn’t hog valuable cabinet space, making it practical for small apartments or RVs.  

[Check FS-TFC FS-RO-100G-A price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b07f71qr5l/)

**Performance: Contamination Reduction and Taste Improvement**  
This reverse osmosis system claims to eliminate more than 1,000 contaminants, ranging from heavy metals to organic impurities. Using a TDS meter, I found my water’s total dissolved solids (TDS) dropped from 250 ppm to almost zero—seriously, that’s impressive. In terms of taste? My coffee got smoother, and the ice cubes came out crystal clear. It genuinely feels healthier and more refreshing. Plus, it’s comforting knowing my family isn’t drinking harmful chemicals like fluoride or arsenic.

**Water Flow Rate**  
I expected the system to slow down my water delivery, but the high flow design was surprisingly efficient. At 60 PSI, it delivers up to 18 liters of purified water per hour. For context, it took just five seconds to fill a 200ml glass. This speed makes it suitable not just for small households but for light commercial use too, like offices or RVs during trips.  

**Maintenance Requirements**  
Owning a filtration system often means committing to regular filter replacements, and this is no exception. These filters are budget-friendly, costing only about $50 annually. That comes down to 13 cents per day, which, in my book, is totally worth it for clean, safe water. The good news is you can replace most components yourself; the quick-connect fittings make it foolproof. However, keeping track of replacement schedules can be a hassle if you’re forgetful.

**Advantages**  
- Significant reduction in TDS, improving water taste and safety.  
- Compact design saves under-sink space.  
- DIY installation with clear instructions, eliminating professional costs.  
- Energy-efficient; works without electricity.  
- Low wastewater ratio (1:1), conserving water compared to older systems.  

**Critiques**  
- It operates within a pressure range of 30–85 PSI, meaning it may not work well at homes with inconsistent water pressure.  
- Regular filter changes, though cheap, can feel like a chore to track.  
- The plastic fittings, while functional, seem fragile compared to metal-based options from competitors.

**Alternative Products**  
Comparing it to popular alternatives such as iSpring RCC7 and APEC Water Systems ROES-50, I noticed some noteworthy differences. Both competitors offer robust filtration, but the FS-TFC stands out with its low-waste ratio and compact design. On the downside, the iSpring model includes a remineralization filter, which this system lacks, leaving the water tasting slightly flat for some people’s preferences. Meanwhile, APEC’s metal fittings feel sturdier, but its overall system is bulkier and harder to install. This offering strikes a happy middle ground for those looking for easy setup and space-saving features.

**Quality for Price**  
The cost of this reverse osmosis system seems justified for what it offers. It’s an affordable resolution to better water, especially when compared to buying bottled water long-term. While other systems might provide slight advantages in durability or extra features, they often cost significantly more. The FS-TFC FS-RO-100G-A offers a solid balance of performance, efficiency, and affordability.

I accidentally spilled a bit of coffee on my mattress while half asleep. It wasn’t a major spill — more like a small splash — but of course it landed right where my mattress protector had shifted out of place during the night. The bed sheet was still on, so I didn’t notice until it was too late.

The coffee stain is about 3 inches wide, and I reacted quickly: dabbed it with a towel and then sprinkled baking soda on it for 20 minutes before vacuuming. I’m freaking out a bit because this is a Brooklyn Standard mattress, and I actually like it a lot. Now I’m not sure if that little spill has permanently stained or damaged it.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Should I try using vinegar or an enzyme cleaner, or is it safer to leave it alone now that it’s mostly dry? I just want to avoid a lingering smell or any long-term damage. Would really appreciate any advice or tips on cleaning without making it worse.

1kei0mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kei0mt/trying_to_understand_why_my_mother_died/,Trying to understand why my mother died,"My mother died suddenly. The autopsy is inconclusive. I have been to see her doctor and he can't really enlighten me. I think she died of a cardiac arrhythmia, but I would like if possible to get some opinions here. Please note that we live in France, so the medical system is a bit different.  
  
My adored, one-of-a-kind mother has died. She was 76, fit, robust, physically and mentally energetic and active, no known health problems...except for one thing.  
  
In May 2021, she fainted at home after feeling nauseated, and although I told her not to go out after that until she'd seen a doctor, she did, and the next afternoon fainted while sitting in her chair in a cafe. She was taken to the emergency room and checked out, including an EKG and blood tests, and turned loose as no problems were found. She saw her general practitioner after this and he showed her some counterpressure manoeuvres to use if she felt faint.  
  
In August 2021 she had what she described as 'a minor faint' while waiting to catch a train. She seemed to find the whole thing rather amusing, certainly did not take it seriously. I should have taken it seriously, but I didn't. She was so fit. She never had any palpitations or breathlessness or chest pain. She never fainted while lying down or while exerting herself, and she exerted herself a lot.  
  
In January 2022, while I was away, she wrote to me: 'I'm just getting up now after 38 hours rest and sleep in bed. I feel fine now. On Saturday afternoon I briefly fainted and bumped my head on my desk. It was probably accumulated fatigue and residual exam stress \[she spent her retirement studying\].'  
  
The next episode was in the summer of 2022: she felt faint without entirely losing consciousness, staggered and broke her fall with her hands going down, but also managed to break her little toe. She went to her GP about the broken toe but, as it turns out, didn't mention why she had fallen. A couple of months later she fainted while on an excursion and was caught by an acquaintance, a retired vet, who advised her to take magnesium supplements. She did and it seemed to help. She had no loss of consciousness after that for two years, just a couple of very brief, mild dizzy spells in the summer of 2023.  
  
In February 2024 our much-loved cat died and she especially was very sad. In September 2024 she was under some stress about stuff regarding the university where she was studying, and at the end of September 2024 she had a sudden loss of consciousness while standing in the supermarket and hit her head hard on the floor. We went to the emergency room. Her EKG and head CT were normal, and she was about to be discharged when she fainted again sitting up in bed. She was admitted and given a transthoracic echocardiogram, blood tests and an ultrasound of her carotid arteries. Everything was normal. I feel though that I did not give a good enough history of her fainting spells -- her medical file from this hospital stay says that she had had 'previous episodes of this type, the most recent three years ago' when in fact it had been two years ago. When she was seen by a cardiologist he asked if it had happened before and I didn't emphasise enough that it had happened half a dozen times before -- I just said yes, once three years back she had fainted and fallen out of her chair in a cafe and been worked up in the ER, and he seemed most interested in whether or not I had witnessed the event, which I had not. He asked about the second fainting spell the previous day that had decided them to admit her and she said she had felt nauseated before it had happened, and that seemed to make up his mind that this was vasovagal syncope. He showed her how to lie down and get her legs in the air if she felt faint so as to stop the loss of consciousness in its tracks. But he also said that if she passed out again, they'd put in an implantable loop recorder to check on her heart just in case.  
  
I had a nagging bad feeling after this. I felt that maybe the loop recorder should have been put in right away. I felt that maybe I should have made clear that she'd had multiple previous episodes.  
  
She went to see her GP, who told her not to worry as her test results were fine. A couple of days after discharge from the hospital she felt faint and sweaty while we were in a museum, so I got her to do her counterpressure manoeuvres -- head down, toes wiggling -- and it cleared without her losing consciousness. Thereafter there was nothing until she had a brief similar spell at the beginning of March, which again passed without her losing consciousness. She had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, not severe enough for a CPAP according to the sleep specialist I got her to see in 2023, and I thought this might be at the root of the fainting (I had also mentioned it to the hospital cardiologist) and worked successfully on getting her to sleep on her side to stop the apnoeic episodes.  
  
Then on 14 March she fainted while in class, fell out of her chair and blacked her eye. Afterwards she was checked out by paramedics who told her her systolic BP was 170 -- it was normally around 120. I knew following this recurrence that something serious was happening. I got her classmate to send her a description of this most recent fainting event, wrote up a full history of her fainting spells from May 2021 onwards, and sent her off to her GP, who made an urgent cardiology referral. She took the history and description to the cardiologist. The cardiologist got another normal EKG out of her, noted some orthostatic hypotension and told her to drink lots of water, advice that she conscientiously followed. He said that it could well be vasovagal syncope, but that an implantable loop recorder would be placed for three years nonetheless. Nothing was said to indicate that there might be a serious risk to her life. She was waiting for the call from the hospital for the appointment to place the loop recorder. She described herself during this time as feeling fatigued in the evenings but not nauseated or dizzy. Then she got her energy back and was her usual self, charging around, studying hard for an exam.  
  
On 17 April she died suddenly, in bed. She didn't have her shoes or her bag on. Her coffee was in the machine waiting to be made. The results of the autopsy were inconclusive.  
  
Can I surmise that she had an undetected arrhythmia and died from that? Or did she maybe 'just' have vasovagal or orthostatic syncope and hit her head in a fall and die from a brain bleed? Did she, God forbid, have a stroke caused by an arrhythmia? Did she know anything, did she suffer? I had been away on a trip and we didn't find her body until the small hours of the 22nd of April, so how much evidence, and of what, would have degraded beyond recovery by then?",1,1746359523.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1kei041,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kei041,My ideal portafilter funnel - maybe yours too!,"After being disappointed with many funnels out there, I set out to fix the many issues I experienced. [I designed this funnel](https://www.printables.com/model/1284079-ultimate-58mm-portafilter-funnel) with five main objectives in mind.

- Precise fit that allows the grounds to span the entire top of the basket - many funnels have a lip that leaves a groove in the coffee when you take out the funnel.
- Twist-lock attachment - mechanical locking is the most secure way to attach instead of magnets, and also my basket (IMS) is barely magnetic. Therefore a mechanical lock means that ALL baskets/portafilters will be securely attached.
- Effortlessly activates the Eureka Mignon power button - many/most portafilter funnels fall into two categories: they have a notch to allow this or this or they must be removed during grinding. The former makes for a worse experience during WDT and the latter is a much worse workflow. Therefore I wanted a nice round funnel which also could be at the right angle to contact the power button while attached.
- Easy to print with zero supports - due to the step for the lip of the portafilter there is very often support materiel involved in the printing of these funnels. I wanted this to print cleanly right off the build sheet with zero supports.
Aesthetically pleasing - many printed funnels look cheap. I wanted something that looked like it actually belonged on the counter.

After many iterations of various tweaks I think this is the best funnel on the internet. If you have any tweaks or ideas please let me know so we can make it even better!

1kehxtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kehxtv/could_the_tbgenius_french_press_coffee_maker/,Could the TBGENIUS French Press Coffee Maker Review Transform Your Morning Brew?,"Testing out the TBGENIUS fef7252b French Press Coffee Maker has been both a rewarding and enlightening experience. As a coffee enthusiast, I couldn’t resist diving deep into the world of French press brewing with this 21-ounce beauty, sizable enough for a few cups yet compact enough for travel. It's marketed as a stylish addition to your kitchen or a thoughtful gift, and I must say, it certainly has some standout qualities—but it's not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The visual appeal of this manual coffee maker immediately caught my eye. It merges simplicity with elegance—thanks to its durable black frame, stainless steel accents, and a heat-resistant borosilicate glass carafe. Handling it for the first time, I appreciated the solid construction. The sturdy handle, securely attached to the steel frame, prevents mishaps like the glass slipping out—a godsend for clumsy mornings! The innovative base, designed to protect the bottom of the pot from direct surface contact, is a thoughtful addition I haven't seen often. However, the glass, while thick enough to feel purposeful, had me a tad concerned about its durability over time—especially if you're anything like me and occasionally knock things around the sink.

**Ease of Use**  
French press lovers value simplicity, and this model nails it in this aspect. The process felt seamless: just pour, wait four minutes, and press. Thanks to the manual operation mode, I could expertly control the brewing process. Even my colleague, who had never used a French press before, was able to use this with minimal guidance. Each component disassembles easily, which makes cleaning a breeze. That being said, if you're not one to enjoy detailed spot cleaning, you might find the disassembly process a touch tedious, particularly when dealing with the four-level filtration system.

**Flavor Extraction**  
Brewing with this coffee maker was, in a word, satisfying. The four-level filtration system was remarkably effective in separating grounds while producing smooth, full-bodied coffee. It impressed me consistently with its rich aroma and robust flavor reminiscent of café-quality coffee. That said, while it does an exceptional job of preventing grit, a few granules sneaked through occasionally—but nothing that ruined the experience. By the way, if tea is more your thing, it doubles as a tea press, which my neighbor was thrilled to try when I borrowed it for a weekend test!

**Advantages**  
- The heat-resistant borosilicate glass maintains water temperature superbly.  
- Multi-purpose as a tea, coffee, and froth milk maker, offering impressive versatility.  
- User-friendly design with straightforward brewing and cleaning techniques.

[Check TBGENIUS fef7252b French Press Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b09y5v9mvg/)

**Positives**  
1. Elegant, portable design suitable for home use or travel.  
2. Stainless steel frame and handle ensure stability and safety during use.  
3. The base isolates the carafe, preventing damage from countertops.  

**Limitations**  
A few mild annoyances cropped up during extended use.  
- The lightweight build can make it feel less premium compared to pricier alternatives.  
- Occasional fine grounds still made it past the filtration system.  
- Its 21-ounce size might be insufficient for larger households or group settings.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
This manual coffee maker faces considerable competition in the French press market. Compared to the Chambord French Press by Bodum, the TBGENIUS model excels in its affordability without severely compromising build quality. Bodum's press feels higher-end due to its thicker carafe, although its base lacks the same protective innovation. For those looking primarily for durability, investing in something like the Fellow Clara French Press may be worthwhile. However, such options come with significantly higher price tags, making this product a solid middle ground for casual users or gifting.  

**Price Performance**  
Budget-conscious shoppers will appreciate how this brewer successfully balances quality with affordability. While not the sturdiest option on the market, it holds its own against pricier competitors by delivering reliable performance. Considering its versatility for coffee and tea lovers alike, the investment feels justified—if not unbeatable—for its price range. You'll want to weigh its pros and cons carefully, but for casual or supplemental use, this machine is a bargain.

1kehxju,https://youtu.be/bKyihVs3ALk,3 Very Scary TRUE Camping Mountain Rescue Disaster Horror Stories,"**""Nightmare on the Cliff: My Sleepwalking Fall in Red River Gorge"":**

I’m Ryan Campbell, a 27-year-old from Cincinnati, Ohio. Back in early September 2014, I thought a camping trip with my friends in Kentucky’s Red River Gorge would be a blast—a chance to unplug, hike, and soak in the wild beauty of the mountains. Instead, it became the most terrifying night of my life, a nightmare of falling off a cliff, clinging to life, and praying for rescue. This is my story, raw and real, based on what happened, with no ghosts or spooky stuff—just the gut-wrenching horror of nature and my own body turning against me.The Grays Arch Trail in Red River Gorge was our pick, a place famous for its rugged cliffs, sandstone arches, and dense forests. Me, my best friend Jake, his girlfriend Sarah, and our old high school buddy Mike piled into Jake’s beat-up Jeep, laughing and blasting music for the three-hour drive from Ohio. The air got cooler as we climbed into the mountains, and when we parked at the trailhead, the view hit me hard—rolling hills, trees glowing red and gold in the fall light, and a sky so clear it felt like you could touch the stars. “This is gonna be the best weekend ever,” Sarah said, tossing her backpack over her shoulder. I grinned, already picturing campfires and cold beers.We hiked a mile to a clearing near a cliff edge, about 60 feet above a rocky slope dotted with bushes and boulders. It wasn’t a sheer drop, but it was steep enough to make your stomach lurch if you peeked over. “Sweet spot,” Mike said, dropping his gear. We pitched our tents, mine a faded green one I’d had since college, right near the edge for the view. The ground was hard, packed with roots, and the air smelled of pine and damp earth. As the sun dipped, we built a campfire, the flames crackling and spitting sparks. Jake passed around beers, and we roasted hot dogs, the grease sizzling as it dripped into the fire. “To epic adventures,” Jake toasted, raising his can. We clinked drinks, laughing.I mentioned my sleepwalking over dinner, something I’d done since I was a kid. “Happens maybe once a month,” I said, shrugging. “I usually just wander the house, no big deal.” Sarah raised an eyebrow. “You sure that’s safe out here?” I waved her off. “I’ll zip my tent tight. Don’t worry.” Mike smirked, tossing a stick into the fire. “Just don’t sleepwalk off the damn cliff, dude.” We all cracked up, the idea so ridiculous it felt impossible. The night deepened, stars blinking through the trees, and the wind carried soft hoots from owls. Around midnight, I crawled into my sleeping bag, the ground cold beneath me, and drifted off, lulled by the forest’s hum.Then, in the dead of night, it happened. I don’t remember unzipping my tent or stepping out. Sleepwalking’s like being a puppet—your body moves, but your mind’s gone. One second I was dreaming, the next I was falling. The ground dropped away, and I was plunging through the dark, air rushing past like a scream. My heart slammed against my ribs, stomach twisting as I flailed, grasping at nothing. Stars blurred above, spinning wildly. I thought, This is it. I’m dead. Then—crash—I slammed into something prickly and springy, branches snapping under my weight. I was tangled in a rhododendron bush, its thick leaves scratching my arms, my legs dangling over a steep slope. Pain exploded in my head, warm blood trickling down my temple, stinging my eyes. My back ached, sharp and deep, like someone had driven a nail into my spine.I gasped, choking on panic. “Where… where am I?” My voice was a hoarse whisper, barely audible over the wind. I blinked, trying to focus. The cliff towered above, my tent a tiny shadow against the moonlight. Below, the slope stretched down, littered with rocks that glinted like teeth. The bush was holding me, but it creaked, roots straining in the loose dirt. If it gave way, I’d tumble straight into those rocks. My hands clamped onto the branches, knuckles white, my arms shaking from the effort. “Help!” I yelled, but my throat was raw, the sound weak. The forest swallowed it, indifferent. My phone, my flashlight—everything was back in the tent. I was alone, bleeding, and terrified.Every sound made me jump—the rustle of leaves, the snap of a twig, the distant howl of a coyote. My mind raced with worst-case scenarios. What if a bear smelled the blood? What if the bush broke? My fingers ached, nails digging into the bark. The cold sank into me, my teeth chattering, my thin T-shirt and sweatpants no match for the night. Blood kept dripping, pooling in my ear, and my head throbbed like it’d split open. “Someone… please,” I muttered, not sure if I was praying or begging. I tried to shift, to ease the pain in my back, but the bush swayed, and I froze, heart pounding. Don’t move. Just hold on.Up at camp, Jake woke around 3 a.m., needing to pee. He stumbled out, zipping up his jacket, and noticed my tent flap flapping open. “Ryan? You out here, man?” he called, his flashlight beam cutting through the dark. Silence. He ducked into my tent—empty, my sleeping bag crumpled. “Guys, wake up!” he shouted, banging on Sarah and Mike’s tents. “Ryan’s gone!” Sarah scrambled out, her hair a mess, eyes wide. “What do you mean, gone?” Mike joined them, rubbing sleep from his face. “His stuff’s here, but he’s not,” Jake said, voice tight. They fanned out, shouting my name. “Ryan! Yo, where you at?” Mike’s voice bounced off the cliffs, unanswered.Sarah’s face paled. “The cliff… what if he sleepwalked?” Jake’s stomach dropped. He sprinted to the edge, nearly tripping on a root, and swept his flashlight down the slope. The beam caught a flash of my blue T-shirt, tangled in the bush, my face ghost-white and streaked with blood. “Holy shit, Ryan!” he screamed. “He’s down there! He’s alive!” Sarah fumbled her phone, hands shaking so bad she nearly dropped it. “911, now!” Mike urged. She dialed, her voice breaking. “We need help! Our friend fell off a cliff at Grays Arch Trail! He’s stuck in a bush, bleeding. Please, hurry!” The operator was calm, grounding. “Stay where you are. Keep him talking if you can. Rescue is on the way.”Jake leaned over the edge, shouting, “Ryan, we see you! Hold on, man! Help’s coming!” His voice was the first thing I’d heard in hours, faint but real. “Jake… I’m so scared,” I croaked, putting everything I had into being loud. “I don’t know how long I can hold on.” My arms were burning, muscles screaming. “You’re gonna be okay!” Sarah yelled, her voice shaking. “Just stay strong!” I wanted to believe them, but the bush groaned, a branch snapping under my weight. I bit back a scream, tears mixing with the blood on my face. Please, God, don’t let me fall.The wait was torture. My friends kept shouting encouragement, their voices my only lifeline. “Talk to us, Ryan! You still with us?” Mike called. “Yeah… barely,” I managed, my throat dry as sandpaper. The cold was numbing my fingers, making it harder to grip. I kept picturing the rocks below, imagining my body broken on them. Every minute stretched, my hope fading. What if the rescuers couldn’t find me? What if they were too late?Finally, after what felt like years but was about three hours, I heard new voices and saw headlamps flickering above. The Wolfe County Search and Rescue team had arrived, their ropes and gear clinking like a promise. “Ryan, I’m Tom, with the rescue team,” a steady voice called. “We’re coming down to you. Hang in there.” I wanted to sob, relief crashing over me, but I was too weak. “Hurry… please,” I whispered, my voice barely a breath.Tom rappelled down, his boots crunching the slope, his headlamp blinding me for a second. He was in his 40s, grizzled, moving with calm precision. “Hey, Ryan, you’re doing great,” he said, kneeling beside me. “Where’s it hurt?” I winced as he checked me. “Head… back… everywhere.” Blood matted my hair, and my spine felt like it was on fire. Tom’s hands were steady, checking my pulse, shining a light in my eyes. “Looks like a bad cut and maybe some spine damage, but you’re tough. We’re gonna get you out.” He strapped a harness around me, careful not to jostle the bush. It creaked, and my heart stopped. “It’s holding,” Tom said, his voice firm. “We’ve got you.”The team above started pulling. The rope tugged, and I inched up, branches scraping my skin, rocks digging into my legs. Every jolt sent pain shooting through me, and I gritted my teeth, trying not to cry out. “Almost there, Ryan!” Jake shouted from above. The cliff edge seemed so far, the night endless. It took an hour, each second a battle to stay conscious. My head swam, vision blurring, but Tom’s voice kept me grounded. “Stay with me, kid. You’re doing awesome.”When I finally reached the top, hands grabbed me, pulling me onto flat ground. I collapsed, gasping, tears streaming down my face. Jake was there, his eyes red. “You scared the hell out of us,” he said, voice breaking. Sarah hugged me, sobbing. “Don’t you ever do that again.” Mike just shook his head, looking like he’d seen a ghost. “Thank you,” I rasped to Tom, who gave a small nod. “Just doing my job. Glad you’re okay.”A helicopter was waiting nearby, its blades thumping. They loaded me onto a stretcher, the night sky spinning as I was lifted in. The flight to Lexington’s hospital was a blur, my mind stuck on the fall, the bush, the rocks. I’m alive, I kept thinking, like it wasn’t real. Doctors swarmed me, stitching a gash on my scalp, X-raying my back. “You’ve got chipped vertebrae, a concussion, and a lot of bruises,” one said, adjusting his glasses. “But you’re lucky. That bush caught you just right. Without it, you’d have hit rock, and…” He didn’t finish, but I knew. I shivered, picturing it.Jake visited the next day, slumping in a chair by my bed. “Man, I thought you were gone,” he said, rubbing his face. “When I saw you in that bush, all bloody… I’ve never felt so helpless.” I tried to smile, my face stiff with bandages. “Guess I owe that bush a fruit basket.” He laughed, but it was shaky. “No more camping near cliffs, alright? I can’t handle that again.” I nodded, my chest tight. “Deal.”Lying there, I couldn’t stop replaying it—the fall, the creak of the bush, the cold dread of waiting. The hospital’s sterile smell, the beep of monitors, it all felt so far from the wild Gorge, but the fear stayed with me. Sleepwalking wasn’t just a quirk anymore; it was a threat. I started seeing a specialist, got meds to keep it under control. I haven’t camped near a drop since, and I don’t know if I ever will.That night changed me. It showed me how thin the line is between a good time and a disaster, how fast everything can slip away. I’m grateful for that bush, for Tom and his team, for my friends who didn’t give up. But the memory of hanging there, alone in the dark, with nothing but a creaking branch between me and death—that’s a chill I’ll never shake.





""**Whispers in the Blizzard: A True Tale of Terror on Mount Hood**"":

I was 17, a junior at Oregon Episcopal School, when I joined the Mount Hood climb in May 1986. It was part of our Basecamp program, a rite of passage for us kids. For weeks, we’d trained hard—swinging ice axes into frozen slopes, strapping crampons to our boots, practicing knots until our fingers ached. I was nervous, my stomach twisting, but the idea of standing on the summit, 11,240 feet up, made my heart race with excitement. The night before, we gathered in the lodge at Timberline, our gear piled in heaps. Father Tom Goman, our chaplain, stood by the fireplace, his voice warm and sure. “Tomorrow, you’ll conquer the mountain,” he said, his eyes bright. “This is your moment.” I believed him. We all did, even as the wind rattled the windows.We started at 2:30 a.m., 20 of us—15 students, two teachers, Father Tom, Marion Horwell, and our guides, Ralph Summers and Dee Zduniak. The air was sharp, slicing through my scarf, but the sky was clear, stars glittering like diamonds. My boots sank into the snow, crunching with every step. We were roped together, our headlamps casting shaky beams across the slope. My breath puffed out in clouds, and my backpack straps dug into my shoulders. Brinton Clark, my best friend, climbed just ahead, her braid swinging under her hood. “This is it, Lorca,” she whispered, grinning. “We’re gonna make it.” I nodded, my chest tight with hope and fear.By dawn, we were high, past 10,000 feet. The mountain stretched endless around us, all snow and rock, the air thin and biting. But the wind had changed, growing meaner, whipping snow into our faces. My goggles fogged, and I wiped them with numb fingers. Ralph stopped us at 11,000 feet, his face grim, half-lost in his parka. “We need to turn back,” he shouted, his voice barely cutting through the wind’s howl. “This storm’s getting bad.”Father Tom stepped forward, snow crusted on his beard. “We’re so close to the summit,” he said. “Let’s push a little further. The kids deserve this.”I glanced at Brinton, her eyes wide, her lips pressed tight. “Should we go back?” I whispered, my voice shaking.She hesitated, her breath hitching. “Father Tom knows best, right? He’s done this before.”I wasn’t sure. The wind screamed like a wild animal, and the snow was a white wall, blinding us. My toes ached in my boots, and my fingers felt like wood. But Father Tom was our leader, our guide in more ways than one. We trusted him. So we kept climbing, higher into the storm.It was the wrong choice. The blizzard hit like a fist, slamming us with ice and wind. Visibility dropped to nothing—I could barely see Brinton, just a blurry shape on the rope. My heart pounded, each beat loud in my ears. Ralph’s voice cut through, faint and urgent. “We’re off course! We need to stop!” Father Tom shouted back, “We’re lost! Dig in! Snow cave!”Lost. The word sank into me, cold and heavy. We were on Mount Hood, 11,000 feet up, in a killer storm. My hands shook as we grabbed our shovels, hacking at the snow. It was wet, heavy, sticking to our gloves. The wind clawed at us, trying to rip us off the mountain. We dug for what felt like hours, carving a tiny cave, just big enough to cram inside. My arms burned, my face stung from the cold. Finally, we crawled in, 18 of us packed like sardines, our wet clothes freezing to our skin.The cave was dark, the air thick with our breath. The walls were uneven, dripping icy water. The wind howled outside, a banshee shaking the snow around us. I hugged my knees, my teeth chattering so hard I thought they’d break. My toes were gone—numb, like they didn’t belong to me. Brinton pressed against me, her shoulder bony under her jacket. “Lorca, you okay?” she asked, her voice small.“I’m scared,” I said, my throat tight. “What if we don’t get out?”“We will,” she said, but her eyes were glassy, uncertain. “We have to.”Father Tom knelt at the front, his hands clasped. “We’re safe here,” he said, his voice steady but tired. “Rescuers will come. Let’s pray.” He started a prayer, but the words felt hollow against the storm’s roar. Marion Horwell, our science teacher, passed out a granola bar, breaking it into tiny pieces. “Eat slow,” she said. “It’s all we’ve got.” I chewed my piece, the oats sticking to my dry tongue. It tasted like sawdust.Hours dragged on. The cold was a living thing, creeping into my bones. My fingers wouldn’t move right, stiff and useless. Someone coughed, a wet, rattling sound that made my stomach twist. Molly Schula, a senior, huddled across from me, her face pale, her lips blue. “Why didn’t we turn back?” she muttered, her voice sharp. “Ralph said to go down.”“Don’t start,” Marion snapped, her eyes flashing. “We’re here now. Focus on staying warm.”“She’s right,” another kid, Erik, whispered. “We should’ve listened to Ralph. This is crazy.”“Enough!” Father Tom said, his voice breaking. “Blaming won’t help. Stay strong.”But the anger hung in the air, thick as the cold. I felt it too—a knot of fear and regret. We’d trusted Father Tom, and now we were trapped. The cave felt smaller, the walls pressing in. I heard a voice calling my name—Lorca! Lorca!—soft, like my mom’s, but far away. I froze, my heart hammering. “Did you hear that?” I whispered to Brinton.“Hear what?” she asked, frowning.“My name. Someone’s calling me.” I peered at the cave’s entrance, where snow swirled in the dim light. Nothing. Just the wind, playing tricks. Later, I thought I saw a shadow move outside—a dark shape in the blizzard, tall and thin. My breath caught, but when I blinked, it was gone. The storm was messing with my head, making me see things that weren’t there. It was creepy, the way the mountain toyed with us, like it wanted us to break.By the second day, we were fading. The cold had stolen our strength. My legs cramped, my head throbbed. We’d run out of food, just a few sips of water left in a shared bottle. Father Tom’s prayers were whispers now, his face gray. Ralph made a decision, his voice firm. “I’m going for help,” he said, pulling on his gloves. “Molly, you’re with me. You’re strong enough.”“You can’t leave!” I cried, panic clawing my chest. “You’ll die out there!”“We have to,” Ralph said, his eyes locking on mine. “It’s our only shot. Stay here, stay alive.” Molly nodded, her jaw tight, and they crawled out, disappearing into the white.The cave felt emptier without them. We waited, the hours blurring. My mind drifted to home—my mom’s lasagna, the way my dog curled up on my bed. I wanted to cry, but my eyes were too dry, my tears frozen. Brinton leaned against me, her breathing shallow. “Tell me we’ll make it,” she whispered.“We will,” I said, forcing the words out. But I wasn’t sure I believed them.On the third day, I heard shouts—real ones, not the wind’s lies. My heart leapt. “They’re here!” Brinton gasped, her voice cracking. We screamed, pounding the cave walls with our fists. Snow fell away, and light poured in. Rescuers in orange jackets dug us out, their faces grim. They pulled us into the storm, wrapping us in blankets. I stumbled, my legs useless, my feet like blocks of ice. The air stung my lungs, but I was alive.They found nine bodies that day. Father Tom, Marion, seven of my classmates—they were gone, their faces peaceful in the snow, like they’d just fallen asleep. I sobbed, the sound raw and ugly. Brinton clung to me, her tears freezing on her cheeks. The rescuers carried us down, their radios crackling. In the hospital, they told me I had hypothermia, frostbite. I lost two toes, the skin black and dead. I didn’t care. I was alive, but the mountain had taken so much.The school was a ghost town after. We held memorials, planted trees, sang hymns, but the grief was a weight we all carried. My nightmares came every night—the wind’s scream, the cave’s walls closing in, those shadows in the snow. People asked why I kept climbing after that, why I became a guide. I tell them it’s for the ones we lost, to teach kids to listen when the mountain warns you. Mount Hood is beautiful, but it’s cruel. It doesn’t care if you’re brave or scared. It just waits, cold and patient, for you to make a mistake. I’ll never forget the storm, the fear, the voices that weren’t there. They weren’t ghosts—just the mountain, reminding me how small we are.





""**Trapped in the Blizzard**"":

I was fifteen, my heart racing with excitement, when we set out for the Cairngorms. It was November 1971, and our school group from Edinburgh was buzzing about the adventure. Eight of us—six students, plus our instructor Catherine and her assistant Sheelagh—were ready for a two-day trek across the mountains. I’d never been so far from home, and the thought of climbing those rugged peaks made me feel alive. The air was sharp, the sky a pale blue, and the mountains loomed ahead, their snowy tops glinting in the weak sunlight. I thought it would be a story to tell forever. I didn’t know it would become a nightmare.We gathered at Lagganlia Outdoor Centre, our backpacks stuffed with sleeping bags, food, and extra socks. The room smelled of damp wool and instant coffee. My best friend Tommy was tying his boots, his curly hair poking out from under his wool hat. “Think we’ll see a stag up there, Robbie?” he asked, his grin wide. I laughed, slinging my pack over my shoulder. “Maybe, if it’s not too cold for them!” My other friends—Sarah, Jamie, Liz, and Peter—were joking nearby, their voices loud with nerves and excitement. Catherine, tall and no-nonsense, clapped her hands. “Alright, everyone, listen up! We’re heading to the Curran shelter for the night. It’s a tough hike, so stay close and follow my lead.” Her voice was firm, but her eyes were warm. Sheelagh, younger and softer-spoken, adjusted her scarf. “It’ll be fun,” she said, though she sounded like she was trying to convince herself.The first day was hard but thrilling. We left the centre, our boots crunching on frosty grass, and started up the mountain path. The Cairngorms were breathtaking—jagged peaks stretching into the distance, patches of heather poking through the snow. The wind was cold, nipping at my ears, but I didn’t care. I felt strong, my breath puffing out in little clouds. Tommy walked beside me, pointing at a distant ridge. “Bet we could race to that,” he said, nudging me. I rolled my eyes. “You’d trip in the snow, clumsy.” We laughed, our voices echoing in the quiet.By late afternoon, my legs ached, and my pack felt heavier. The sun was sinking, painting the snow pink and gold. We stopped near a small ridge, where Catherine decided we’d camp for the night. “Good work, everyone,” she said, unfolding her map. “We’re on track. Tomorrow, we’ll reach the shelter.” Sheelagh handed out hot cocoa from a thermos, and we sat in a circle, sipping it while the wind howled softly. Sarah, her blonde hair tucked under a hat, shivered. “It’s freezing already,” she said. Jamie, always the joker, grinned. “Just imagine the stories we’ll tell back at school!” I fell asleep in my tent, the cold seeping through my sleeping bag, but I was too tired to care.Morning came, and everything changed. I woke to a gray sky, snow falling thick and fast. The wind was louder now, a low moan that made my stomach twist. I crawled out of my tent, my breath catching as snowflakes stung my face. The others were already up, packing quickly. Sheelagh’s face was tight, her hands fumbling with her gloves. “This is bad,” she muttered to Catherine, who was staring at the map like it could save us. “We need to move,” Catherine said, her voice steady but her eyes worried. “The shelter’s not far. We’ll be fine if we stick together.” I glanced at Tommy, his face pale under his hood. “You okay?” I whispered. He nodded, but his lips were pressed tight, like he was holding back fear.We started walking, single file, into the blizzard. The snow was blinding, swirling so thick I could barely see Catherine’s red jacket ahead of me. My boots sank with every step, the effort making my thighs burn. The wind screamed, pushing against us like an invisible wall. My scarf was caked with ice, and my fingers ached inside my mittens. “Stay close!” Catherine shouted, her voice muffled by the storm. I grabbed Tommy’s sleeve, afraid we’d lose each other. Sarah was behind me, her steps slow. “It’s too cold,” she mumbled, her voice shaky. I wanted to say something to cheer her up, but my teeth were chattering too hard.Hours dragged on, and we were lost. The shelter never appeared. My legs felt like they were made of stone, and my chest hurt from breathing the icy air. Catherine stopped, her face grim as she checked her compass. “We’re off course,” she admitted, her voice low so the wind wouldn’t carry it. Sheelagh’s eyes widened, snow clinging to her eyelashes. “Should we dig in? Wait out the storm?” she asked, her voice high with panic. Catherine shook her head. “No, we keep moving. We’ll find it.” I wanted to believe her, but doubt gnawed at me. Tommy leaned close, his breath warm against my ear. “How much farther, Robbie? My feet hurt bad.” His voice cracked, and I saw fear in his eyes. “Not long,” I said, though I had no idea. I just needed him to keep going.By afternoon, the blizzard was a beast. The wind roared like it was alive, slamming into us with every step. Snow piled up to our waists, and I had to lift my knees high just to move. My fingers and toes were numb, like they didn’t belong to me anymore. Sarah stumbled, falling to her knees. Her face was blue, her eyes half-closed. “I can’t feel my hands,” she whispered, tears freezing on her cheeks. Catherine dropped beside her, rubbing her arms. “You’re okay, Sarah. Just keep moving. We’re almost there.” But Sarah’s head lolled, and I saw something in her eyes—like she was already fading. I grabbed her arm, pulling her up. “Come on, Sarah, you can do this,” I said, my voice desperate. She tried, but her steps were weak, like a puppet with cut strings.Night fell, and we couldn’t go on. The cold was a knife, slicing through my clothes, my skin, my bones. Catherine made us dig a trench in the snow—a shallow pit to shield us from the wind. We crammed inside, eight of us pressed together, our breath steaming in the dark. The cold was unbearable, making my whole body shake. Tommy was next to me, his teeth chattering so loud it hurt to hear. “We’re gonna be okay, right?” he asked, his voice small. I nodded, my throat tight. “Yeah, Tommy. We’ll make it.” But inside, I was terrified. I wanted to scream, to run, to be anywhere but here. Instead, I hugged my knees, trying to hold onto the little warmth I had left.The night was a blur of pain and fear. The wind screamed, piling snow over our trench until it felt like a grave. I heard whimpers, then silence. Sarah wasn’t moving. I shook her, my hands clumsy. “Sarah, wake up!” My voice was hoarse, raw from the cold. Her face was still, her lips blue. Catherine crawled over, her flashlight shaking in her hand. “She’s gone,” she whispered, her voice breaking. Gone? The word hit me like a punch. Sarah, who’d laughed with me just yesterday, was gone. Tommy sobbed, his face buried in his scarf. I felt tears burn my eyes, freezing before they could fall.Morning came, but the storm didn’t stop. The trench was half-buried, and we were weaker, hungrier, colder. Jamie and Liz didn’t wake up. Their faces were peaceful, like they were sleeping, but their skin was hard as ice. Each loss was a weight on my chest, crushing me. Sheelagh’s voice was barely a whisper. “We need to move. We’ll die here.” Her eyes were red, her face gaunt. Catherine nodded, her lips cracked and bleeding. “Help is coming,” she said, but it sounded like she was begging the sky to make it true.We crawled out of the trench, the blizzard still raging. My body screamed with every step, my vision blurry from exhaustion. Tommy leaned on me, his weight heavy. “Don’t leave me, Robbie,” he mumbled, his words slurring. “I won’t,” I promised, though my own strength was fading. Catherine led us, her steps slow but stubborn. Sheelagh stayed at the back, her voice faint as she called, “Keep going, just a little more!” But the snow was endless, the cold a monster that wouldn’t let go.I don’t know how long we stumbled through the storm. My mind was foggy, my body numb. Then, through the white haze, I heard a shout. “Over here!” Shadows moved in the snow, growing clearer—men in bright jackets, their faces grim but alive. The mountain rescue team. My knees buckled, relief flooding me like warmth I’d forgotten. “We’re saved,” I whispered, my voice cracking. But when I turned to Tommy, his eyes were closed, his body limp in the snow. I shook him, screaming his name, but he was gone, too.They carried us down the mountain, wrapping us in blankets that felt like fire against my frozen skin. Catherine and I were the only ones left, barely alive. My fingers and toes were black, my heart shattered. Five friends—Tommy, Sarah, Jamie, Liz, Peter—gone. Sheelagh, gone. The hospital was a blur of white walls, beeping machines, and nurses’ soft voices. They saved my life, but nothing could erase the memory of those mountains.I learned later that the storm was one of the worst in years, a freak blizzard that caught everyone off guard. It changed things—new rules for treks, better training, safer gear. But no rule could bring back my friends. I still see their faces, hear their voices. I dream of the snow, the wind, the cold that stole them away. I survived, but a part of me is still up there, lost in the Cairngorms, where the blizzard held us in its grip and wouldn’t let go.

I blame her for quitting and I hate her for being avoidant. I feel betrayed, abandoned. You can still love someone even if you hate one type of their behavior.

I admit I made mistakes, I communicated poorly, I regret that. I apologized. I am trying to improve myself. None of this matters to her. This is why I started to accept one thing.

This wasn't my fault.

I never did anything so horrendous to warrant a break up. I didn't cheat, I wasn't avoidant, I wasn't disrespectuf, I wasn't mean. My only intent was to communicate openly and try to find middle ground.

She said things happened, and it's sad that we split, but it's nobody's fault. Yes things happened, but split didn't just happen. She made it happen. She did it before, many times, she admitted. She's not a fighter, she's a quitter. She destroys her relationships.

She told me with me she felt different. I believed her.

I tried to do everything I could to convince her that this can work. I tried everything I should, and more. I tried.

The hard truth is that in our case, if it blew up over a triviality, it would blow up for certain in a case of a real and serious issue. It's not me, it's her. She runs away from problems. She cannot make hard and necessary decisions. She stays in a limbo of discontent unable and unwilling to move out. She rejects any help she is offered.

This short relationship and its breakup apparently boosted my self esteem. I no longer feel inadequate. I no longer have any suicidal thoughts. My future seems worse, especially in terms of finding a life partner. I can't imagine how I could find someone like her or even close. Even with those feelings and though nothing seems to bring me joy and I have no clue what to do next, I somehow feel stronger. I cannot explain it.

I wish I could help her, with my newly found strength. As a partner, even as a friend. It hurts me to see what she's doing to herself. Almost like watching a junkie ruin their life. And I know what it's like because I used to be self-destructive exactly the same way.

Leave no man behind. But if they don't want to grab the outstretched hand, and wiggle out of your grip even, you can't hold the entire sinking ship above water. Even if you could they might just jump into the ocean.

I wish she would contact me, said she worked out her issues and wanted to meet for coffee. I would have said yes, let's meet. Let's talk. But she's not going to. That's not who she is.",3,1746358959.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1kehttv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kehttv/explore_if_the_wacaco_nanopresso_espresso_maker/,Explore if the WACACO Nanopresso espresso maker is worth your investment review!,"Testing portable coffee makers has become a bit of a ritual for me, and the **WACACO Nano+BAG FBA** was next on my list. Its sleek design, manual operation, and promise of delivering espresso anywhere intrigued me. I’ve worked with high-end machines and portable gadgets before, so I was pretty skeptical when it came to just how much crema this compact device could pull off. Yet here I am, slightly amazed and equally critical after a month of using it. Let’s dive in!

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the Nano+BAG looks like a gadget for someone who loves coffee as much as they love convenience. Its matte black finish paired with a metallic look speaks of modern style. It's compact and cylindrical, fitting snugly in my hand or seamlessly into a backpack. The machine weighs just 12 ounces, making it an easy travel companion. My first impression: durable yet lightweight. However, the hardened plastic exterior doesn’t scream “premium.” It’s sturdy, sure, but it won’t win any elegance awards. I quickly felt that its appeal leans entirely towards functionality.  

Inside the package, you find more than just the device—a built-in espresso cup, reusable filter basket, scoop, brush, instruction manual, warranty card, and even stickers. Every tool felt purposefully included. But, the tight fit of the protective case just didn’t sit well with me—it’s a squeeze to zip everything in, leaving no room for extras like the brush.

**Ease of Use**  
Having used the device daily, I can confidently say it’s straightforward to operate. After my first attempt, I barely needed to look at the manual again. You fill the water tank (good for one small cup), add finely ground coffee (you really need to tamp it down), screw everything together, and start pumping. It’s manual, meaning you provide all the pressure, up to 18 bars (261 PSI). If that sounds daunting, it’s surprisingly not. The new pump mechanism requires 15% less effort than previous generations like the Minipresso, which I truly appreciated. One sleepy morning, I even managed to spill water while assembling it. It's simple but definitely demands attention.

**Strengths**  
- Portable and lightweight — perfect for travel, camping, or office use.  
- Manual operation, no electricity or batteries needed.  
- Produces thick, velvety crema consistently.  
- Easy assembly after just one or two practice runs.  

**Coffee Quality**  
I won’t lie—I wasn’t expecting much. Skepticism filled me as I brewed my first cup using some freshly ground beans from my favorite local roaster, and then I tasted it. What shocked me was the balance of flavors and the creamy shot of espresso it produced. It wasn’t as complex as a $700 espresso maker’s coffee, but it came surprisingly close. The crema was dense, though it didn’t last long—a small price to pay for portable perfection. Compared to my countertop espresso machine, this little guy is definitely more of a quick fix than a ritual brew.

**Good Aspects**  
- Brew quality exceeds expectations for a portable setup.  
- Compatible with reusable NS capsules via a separate adapter.  
- Intuitive design makes it fun and rewarding to use.   

[Check WACACO Nano+BAG FBA price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0797t2fyl/)  

**Challenges of Portability**  
While I swear by its portability, a few drawbacks can’t go unnoticed. First, the water tank size limits you to a single small espresso shot at a time. During a group camping trip, it became cumbersome brewing cup after cup for my friends while they watched. Coffee for one? Perfect. Coffee for three? Not ideal. Cleaning is another mild inconvenience because coffee grounds inevitably cling to the portafilter.  

**Negatives**  
- Limited water capacity, making only one small shot per fill.  
- Protective case design is a tight squeeze, leaving no extra space.  
- Manual pressure pumping isn’t for everyone—it takes effort!  

**Competing Products**  
Among rivals like the AeroPress Go and Handpresso, the Nano+BAG shines in its ability to hit high pressure for authentic espresso. The AeroPress excels in versatility, allowing for americanos and cold brews, but lacks the crema this machine delivers. Meanwhile, the Handpresso shares a focus on espresso but feels bulkier when packed for trips. I measured them up side by side, and for portability and crema, the WACACO device stands apart. Still, if you hate pumping manually, other brands offer electric models, albeit at a far steeper price.

**Price Worthiness**  
Pricing matters, especially for coffee gadgets, and this model sits comfortably in the budget-friendly range for what it delivers. One-shot wonders like this often come at higher premiums, but you won’t feel ripped off with this one. If portability and consistent espresso are priorities, you’re getting excellent return on investment. While I recommend purchasing the Barista Kit for larger cup options, the extra cost might make some hesitate.

ALL YOUR WORK RUINED! START FROM SCRATCH! plot twist that’s coming up in Act 2; what the hell are you going to do when you have to rent theatres for every single one digit of your screenings? 

What if you’d never relied on buying theatres for the profits? Looks like we’re going to see how that works. 

At least I hope so.

I’ve been doing a trash king “fuck the alliance, mega management” playthrough (still only on v 0.8.12) because I thought relying on the alliance for double profits and being able to make $300 million on basic movie-making was just too easy.

I spent a good few hours this morning writing up a time schedule, tailoring scripts to actors strengths, planning writers rotations etc., just to manage the next three years of constant four week movie releases that make sense and have continuity. My thought is that this is how the game is played; on pause and leaning back thinking up good movie ideas, making some changes, unpausing for a moment to let a few days roll by, then paused again for another couple of hours:

It reminded me of the same feel of isometric tactical, especially in Police 2 and Rebel Cops; that carefully paced progression and setting up one ad hoc killing field after the other, of course the beauty of Police and Rebel Cops is that you’re not killing anybody, just cracking their skulls and cuffing them, leaving them unconscious in the snow, for someone else to deal with later. 

And here it is the same thing. Sure, you say, I might be saying something incredibly obvious with all of this; “i know this, duh!”, and that’s probably true, ‘but’ have you really savoured the taste of the intricacy going on here?

I mean here, that: there is dinner and then there is Dinner, or: there is coffee and then there is Coffee… to express any better than this the staggering height that is chasm of distance between the one and the other to one to whom only knows coffee or dinner? “would that it were so simple.”

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Lucky Jack product line boasts several impressive features that set it apart from the competition.

**Organic Certification:** Lucky Jack exclusively uses 100% USDA-certified organic coffee beans.

This means that the coffee beans are grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers, ensuring a purer and healthier beverage. The organic certification reflects Lucky Jack's dedication to environmentally friendly and sustainable farming practices. This feature is particularly appealing to consumers who are conscious about the origins and production methods of their coffee.

**Cold-Brew Process:** Lucky Jack employs a proprietary cold-brew extraction method.

This process involves steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in cold water for an extended period, typically 12 to 24 hours. Cold brewing extracts the coffee's natural flavors while minimizing acidity and bitterness. The result is a smoother, sweeter, and more balanced cup of coffee that is gentle on the stomach. This method also preserves more of the coffee's antioxidants, offering potential health benefits.

**Nitro Infusion (Select Products):** Certain Lucky Jack products are infused with nitrogen gas.

This process involves injecting nitrogen into the coffee, creating a velvety smooth texture and a cascading effect when poured. The nitrogen bubbles add a creamy mouthfeel without the need for dairy or sweeteners. Nitro-infused coffee provides a unique sensory experience, enhancing the overall enjoyment and making it a standout option for those seeking a premium coffee indulgence.

**Low Acidity:** Lucky Jack coffee is known for its significantly lower acidity compared to traditionally brewed coffee.

This is primarily due to the cold-brew extraction method, which extracts fewer acidic compounds from the coffee beans. Lower acidity makes Lucky Jack coffee easier on the digestive system and reduces the likelihood of heartburn or acid reflux. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals with sensitive stomachs or those who are looking for a coffee that won't cause discomfort.

**Ready-to-Drink Convenience:** Lucky Jack offers a range of ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee options.

These products are pre-packaged and ready to consume, providing convenience for busy individuals or those who are on the go. The RTD format eliminates the need for brewing equipment or preparation time, making it a quick and easy way to enjoy a high-quality cold-brew coffee. This convenience factor significantly contributes to Lucky Jack's appeal in the fast-paced modern lifestyle.

**Sustainable Packaging:** Lucky Jack is committed to using eco-friendly and sustainable packaging materials.

This includes recyclable cans and bottles, as well as efforts to reduce overall waste. By prioritizing sustainable packaging, Lucky Jack demonstrates a commitment to environmental responsibility and appeals to consumers who are concerned about the impact of their purchasing decisions on the planet. This focus aligns with the growing trend of eco-conscious consumerism.

 ## Core Benefits

Lucky Jack offers several tangible benefits that make it a compelling choice for coffee lovers.

**Reduced Acidity and Enhanced Digestibility:** Lucky Jack's cold-brew process significantly lowers the coffee's acidity, making it easier on the stomach. Individuals who typically experience heartburn or digestive issues with regular coffee often find Lucky Jack to be a more tolerable and enjoyable option. This allows them to indulge in their coffee craving without the discomfort that traditional brewing methods can cause.

**Smoother, Richer Flavor Profile:** The cold-brew extraction method brings out the natural sweetness and nuanced flavors of the coffee beans, resulting in a smoother and richer taste. This eliminates the bitterness often associated with hot-brewed coffee, creating a more palatable and satisfying drinking experience. Many users find that Lucky Jack requires less added sugar or cream, allowing them to savor the pure coffee flavor.

**Convenience for On-the-Go Consumption:** With its ready-to-drink format, Lucky Jack provides unparalleled convenience for individuals with busy lifestyles. The pre-packaged cans and bottles can be easily stored in a bag or refrigerator and consumed whenever and wherever desired. This eliminates the need for brewing equipment, preparation time, or the hassle of visiting a coffee shop, making it a perfect solution for those who are constantly on the move.

**Health-Conscious Choice:** Lucky Jack's commitment to organic ingredients and sustainable practices aligns with the values of health-conscious consumers. The absence of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers ensures a purer and healthier beverage, while the sustainable packaging reflects a commitment to environmental responsibility. This allows consumers to enjoy their coffee guilt-free, knowing that they are supporting a brand that prioritizes both their well-being and the health of the planet.

**Enhanced Energy Levels Without the Jitters:** The caffeine content in Lucky Jack coffee provides a sustained energy boost without the jitters or crash often associated with traditionally brewed coffee. The slower extraction process and lower acidity contribute to a more balanced caffeine release, resulting in a smoother and longer-lasting energy boost. This makes it an ideal beverage for those who need a pick-me-up to stay focused and productive throughout the day.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is Lucky Jack coffee suitable for people with acid reflux?**
Yes, Lucky Jack coffee is generally well-tolerated by people with acid reflux due to its lower acidity. The cold-brew process extracts fewer acidic compounds compared to hot brewing methods, making it gentler on the stomach. However, individual tolerance may vary, so it's always best to start with a small serving and monitor your body's response.

**What is the shelf life of Lucky Jack ready-to-drink coffee?**
Lucky Jack ready-to-drink coffee typically has a shelf life of several months from the date of production. The exact expiration date is printed on the can or bottle. It's important to store the coffee in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to maintain its quality and freshness. Once opened, it's best to consume the coffee within a day or two for optimal flavor.

**Does Lucky Jack offer decaffeinated options?**
While Lucky Jack's primary focus is on caffeinated cold-brew coffee, they may offer decaffeinated options in select product lines. It's best to check their website or product packaging to confirm the availability of decaffeinated choices. If decaf options are available, they typically undergo a gentle decaffeination process to minimize any impact on the flavor profile.

**Where can I purchase Lucky Jack coffee?**
Lucky Jack coffee is widely available at major grocery stores, natural food stores, and online retailers. You can find it on the shelves of popular chains like Whole Foods Market, Sprouts, and Target, as well as through online platforms such as Amazon and the Lucky Jack website. Availability may vary depending on your location, so it's always a good idea to check with your local retailers or online stores.

1kehmh5,https://i.redd.it/v5mczhv53rye1.jpeg,The 9 Circles of British Council Hell: Circle Eight – Vindication (Part Two) The Waiting Game,"The wait for the results of the investigation was a strange mix of dread and anticipation.

I knew the evidence I had submitted was solid.

Every document. Every timeline. Every painful truth.

But with each email, the investigator remained neutral—emotionless.

No clue. No hint.  
Just procedural distance.

So I did what anyone in limbo does—I **reached out to the past**.

I connected with a former BC colleague who, like me, had been chewed up and spat out by the machine. She carried her own scars from that place: the cliques, the overwork, the silent cruelty of people like **Martyn**, and the complicity of those who stood by. We met often during that time—walks, coffee, long talks. Her presence helped.  
She wasn’t shocked I’d been suspended.  
She wasn’t shocked by *any* of it.

Three weeks passed.

I was growing restless.

The **Operations Manager**—the only contact I was allowed—was polite, even kind.  
But ultimately, she offered nothing.

Then, out of nowhere—my BC email pinged.

It was my **mentee**, writing to say how excited she was to work with me.  
How she admired my work and couldn’t wait to meet.  
She was the **second most senior manager in British Council Japan.**

And my heart sank.

This should’ve been a career high.  
But instead, it was a **gut punch**.  
How could I mentor anyone—when the very institution I served had tossed me aside?

I stared at the email.  
Rage.  
Grief.  
I wanted to reply with everything I was feeling. I wanted to scream in pixels.

Instead, I shut the screen.  
And walked.

It was autumn. Cold. The wind sharp, like the universe trying to slap sense into me.

Days later—another message.  
This time from her secretary, asking me to confirm the Teams meeting.

I wanted to punch the screen.

I paced.  
I muttered.  
And finally—I sat down.

And typed.

>

It was the **first time** I had put it in writing.

The first time I said what had been eating away at me for years.  
This wasn’t just about injustice.  
It was about **erasure**.

I cc’d the **Japan Director**.

No reply.

Days passed.  
So I broke protocol.

At that point, I didn’t care anymore.

I messaged the Director directly:

*“Thanks for being the best boss I’ve worked with.”*

Maybe it was dramatic.  
Maybe it was goodbye.

But it was **honest**.

I liked him. He’d always been calm. Respectful. He listened.  
But even he was silent now.

So I shut down the screen again.  
And I walked—this time for a long, long while.

Still no word. Still no outcome.  
But something inside me had changed.

I was starting to enjoy life **without the BC.**

**Seven Weeks Later...**

Then it happened.

An email arrived.

It was from the **investigator**.

The verdict?

**I was cleared.**

Officially.

I had **not lied** about my credentials.  
The TESOL diploma I earned in China was legitimate.  
The allegations that led to my suspension? **Baseless.**

They offered to pay for a supplemental course to “enhance” the qualification.  
But after everything—after the racism, the manipulation, the union with no spine—I declined.

I didn’t need to prove anything else.  
**They did.** And they couldn’t.

I chose my freedom.  
And they placed me on **garden leave**—six months to breathe, to reflect, to move on.

**Kate**

Before the dust fully settled, something remarkable happened.

I was contacted by **Kate Ewart-Biggs**, Deputy Chief Executive of the British Council.

This wasn’t some box-ticking manager.  
This was someone near the top—someone who **could have ignored me, but didn’t**.

She acknowledged my experience.  
She validated the harm.  
And she confirmed I was **cleared.**

In that brief but meaningful exchange, something inside me relaxed.

It was over.  
I had survived.  
And now, **I was seen.**

**The Final Curtain**

A week later, I met with one of the BC’s directors for a farewell lunch.

We picked **Ginza**—Tokyo’s elegant heart.  
But it was pouring. Heavy, unrelenting rain.

He chose a strange little pizza place, hidden between boutiques and office buildings.  
It felt oddly casual for something like this.

We ordered beers.  
Pizza.  
Closure.

At first, I was nervous. But after a few sips, I felt the weight ease.

We talked about the Council.  
Why he loved it.  
Where he’d been.  
The people he’d met.

I shared my memories, too.

The **UK Ambassador.**  
The time I met the **Emperor’s mother** at a play.  
How the Council had, in its early days, supported my health when I needed it most.

We reminisced about the madness.

The **Martyns**, the **Laura Pratts**.  
We both dodged talking about **Mike**.

Neither of us needed to.

As the rain lightened and our plates emptied, he leaned forward and said:

*“I know this was a tough experience for you.*  
*But you can have a reference from me anytime.”*

I was stunned.

At the British Council, **references are rare**.  
A reference from a **diplomatic director**?

**That was gold.**

We stood.

*“Did you have a good time?”*  
“Yeah,” I said, flatly.

Not joy.  
Not regret.

Just **clarity**.

We shook hands.  
And walked in opposite directions—me into the Tokyo evening, him into the rain.

I didn’t leave the British Council in shame.  
I didn’t leave broken.

I left **with my name cleared**,  
**a reference in my hand**,  
and a story they could never erase.

This was goodbye.  
And it was **mine**.",2,1746358086.0,SurvivorsOFtheBCJ,1,1.0,False

I was laying in bed around 4a.m. or so having a panic attack, and extreme anxiety. And decided to try some breathing exercises. (I try to be holistic as much as I can) anyways, I take a three stage deep breath in. Starting with belly breath, chest breath and final, head breath.( this is all in the same breath in, mind you) hold for roughly 4-7 seconds. And on my exhale, I exhale almost in a forced but extremely slow way. Like I'm exhaling through one of those tiny skinny lowball cocktail straws, or those skinny coffee store stick at gas stations er w.e. and can exhale for what I want to say feels like up to 1 minute..
during this time I felt my heart (what it felt like, was stop beating) and I could like really feel my heart extra now and was hyper aware,sensitive, hyper just, throughly really feeling my heart on its own, hard to explain. But it's beat transitioned into a wave from top to bottom. I could literally see it do this motion by watching my chest and also feel it with my hand.. like someone doing the ""wave"" with your arms. (I'm still slowly letting out the same breath I took in) there are no more beat intervals, just a fluid wave motion. ""~ ~ ~"" <<(but reverse the way those squiggly icons are flowing if that makes sense) thats how it was ""beating"" now, (Top to bottom top to bottom) so..no, ""thump thump, thump thump""
 now my heart rate was probably terrifying before I started this breathing exercise because like I said I was having a panic attack and often do at night and have alot of trouble sleeping cause of multiple factors and issues mostly anxiety amping it up. It's very intense like my chest tightens, im pretty sure i experience tunnel vision during this as well. Also during this I feel like I turn pale cause I kinda get cold as well n sometimes start sweating, and strong feelings of nausea etc. ( experiencing these things because of the panic/anxiety attack, not the breathing exercise.)though I've never looked in mirror during these episodes (I'm sure it a scary sight to see anyways) and I'm not exaggerating when I say this dude, and can't stress this enough.. my heart rate, w.e. tf it is and how spiked my bpm's are at the moment will DROP! Instantaneously to the slowest I think I've ever felt it operate, beat, wave, w.e. it does per minute, EVER.. And this occurs at the MOMENT, my heart begins, Transitions or functions as, or into ""wave"" form of operation or flow w.e. you wanna call it, compared to the regular ""thump thump, thunp thump"" operation of thebheart. And I feel like maybe this VERY SUDDEN and EXTREME CHANGE IN HEART RATE has possibly made my heart adapt/evolve from the rapid change, and how often it was happening..not to mention the really weird ""beat"" flowing pattern my heart takes on during this exhale. 
Anyways.. my higher self or something in the universe tells me or makes me feel like this is not a good thing.. and I have zero proof cause I have not gone to doctor etc, but idk why I just get a VERY STRONG feeling that I have somehow maybe evolved (my) the heart muscle into creating another opening somewhere, ventricle, flap passage way idk... idk what to think about it, but I know that the way my heart pumps blood during this is definitely not normal..and I'm just curious if anyone has an answer, some insight, advice, feedback, anything in regards to this. Please and thank you!

I ran several cycles of water through it to flush/clean it out.  I was running it with just a portafilter with no coffee and no filter basket.  When I pulled the handle up, hot water and steam came out quickly. I never was able to pull it all the way up due to how much water was coming out.

I have nothing to compare this to; is this normal? I thought pulling the handle up just filled the group head. If I held the handle up, the whole boiler would have emptied out.

Is something wrong with the machine?

Aesthetic cafes with good coffee and maybe oat milk,
Clubs or lounges with good music, a lil boujee but not too much (I still have tuition to pay),
Chill day activities (nature, art, food markets, etc.),
Golf ,yoga and marathons

1kehfgo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kehfgo,My 2 cents on the NM cafe situation again (part 2),"Being a resident here, I've come to notice how the café culture in Navi Mumbai has evolved, but tbh it’s been a mixed bag. The demand for cafés isn’t as high here compared to areas like Bandra or Andheri, where this culture is more of a lifestyle. Many cafés niche down too hard focusing so much on specific themes that they sometimes overlook the basics: pricing that makes sense for the local crowd, consistency in food quality, cleanliness, and overall service experience. These might seem like small things, but they can really make or break a place.

That said, there are a few spots here which I did not mention in my previous post but continue to hold their ground and have maintained integrity in their taste, and service without trying to be something they’re not. I’ve loved these cafés for that and would love y’all to try them out too.

- Moi Doughsseir, Vashi  for anyone with a sweet tooth craving good cheesecakes and coffee. 

- Erba, Belapur They originally started in Vashi but wasn't surprised when they shut since I assumed the pricing didn’t sit well with everyone, but trust me those Neapolitan-style pizzas are worth it.

- The Big Churn at Vashi/Seawoods have their gelato game strong and I especially love their affogato. 

- Communion, Belapur I get that not everyone is on board with this one, but I personally really enjoy it. Always make it a point to have their Shakshouka and matcha when I’m in the area.

- Special Shoutout to El Tacos (Kharghar) & Gourmet Burgers. not exactly cafés but definitely deserve a mention. El Tacos has nailed thier mexican cuisine, and Gourmet Burgers have really come up from starting at home to now having 3 outlets.",13,1746357351.0,navimumbai,3,1.0,False
1kehfaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kehfaf/gi_full_list_of_my_tips_for_hs_college_students/,(GI) Full List of My Tips for HS / College Students,"Hi everyone! Quick disclaimer that I am not a professional in anything other than my own body. My tips&tricks come from me and my friend group of about 3 other people who all have various GI issues. 

However, I have some advice to offer for those who have issues right now, especially since its high stress for a lot of students. Even if you're not chronically ill, a student, or diagnosed yet, these still might help you because they're quite general. Stress and anxiety directly tie to poor GI health, many people are dropping like flies (even if they aren't CI, so stay safe! Right now, it can be anywhere from Junior year grades, AP classes, college applications, exams/finals, or more (at least where I live.)

-SPEND TIME OUTSIDE! Distract yourself.
Does not have to be exercise necessarily. But get some sun. You NEED a breather even if you think you're 'stronger than that' or 'are doing fine.' I recommend taking walks, though. I hated when people told me to do stuff like this to manage health, but it sucks because it actually works, just needs a consistent effort. 
--Subtip under this one, do NOT use devices to distract yourself unless absolutely necessary. Distractions don't HAVE to be exercise or time outside, but phones exacerbate the issue. Especially social media. Limit screen time. I'm guilty of watching YouTube or videos everytime I feel like garbage, but it really just stresses you out more. Music is nice. What I really mean by this is find a healthy outlet for stress, don't get sucked in to the black hole of doomscrolling.

-Berries are our best friends.
Fresh fruit can be hard to acquire for some people, but it's good to access it if you can. I grow my own (the variety Toscana, these in particular are so soft and tasty that they make it really easy to eat even with bad acid reflux.) My personal favorite alternative if you can't get some is white rice (or bone broth pilaf) for easy digestion. However, the fiber, nutrients, and easy digestibility of small tasty fruits is unbeatable in my opinion. Its refreshing and distracts me from my acid reflux. Personally I don't recommend bananas unless very ripened, the starch content of young bananas can make you sicker. !!!If you do not know your own triggers!!! then you can avoid if you're worried. Start small just to see which specific items don't trigger you. 

-You likely will pull all nighters either from studying, stress, or illness.
Do NOT forget to make room for a full 6-8 hr sleep minimum per 24 hrs. Absolutely IMPERATIVE!!! Even naps are fine. Uninterrupted sleep is best but beggars can't always be choosers. I CANNOT stress enough that you need sleep.

-Breathing exercises.
Even if you're not stressed, pick a 5-15 minute period per day. You can do it while studying. Take a deep breath over the course of 4-6 seconds starting from the stomach gently, then hold 2-3+ seconds, and breath out slowly. It feels great when youre not sick, and is literally a lifesaver if you have heartburn/pain or anxiety. Managing heart rate is a miracle-worker for GI issues for me, I don't know why exactly.

-Studying does NOT take priority over health no matter what.
MAKE time for basic self care even if you feel like you don't have it.
Following that point, if you are chronically ill, do not set 'time studied' goals! Do NOT say ""Ill study two hours today"" unless your plan is to intersperse breaks very liberally. Focuse on understanding and content recall, not the clock. Subscoring this, active learning is better. Flashcards, practice, working on problems, writing notes, etc. will help you learn quicker than watching videos. It is very important for people who get stressed or sick to make a consistent effort rather than only a last-minute cram. You decrease risk of getting catastrophically ill last minute before you finish studying or too caught up in meeting deadlines rather thsn furthering education. Although, I do always encourage a 5-30 minute speedrun before any test always, for some extra short term recall.

-Get a heating pad.
Blankets are fine too, but my experience is that this offers quicker relief. A lot of you might have one already, so make use of it if so. Warm showers really help too but water bill becomes an issue; I alternate between the a nice shower and a heater. This is really good for stomach aches or tenseness of almost all kinds, just don't warm up too fast or use for too long. You could get burned if you forget about it, although most pads made for human use won't cause significant damage or has an auto shut off. Some of my friends prefer weighted blankets because it ""feels like it evens out the pressure across the body"" but I've never tried it. I personally feel like my stomach is being crushed when it hurts and don't want much more pressure, but those blankets by themselves are niceeeeee.


**this one doesn't apply to everyone.
-For menstrual/period symptoms, take medicine early. 'Meds' early applies to everyone, obviously don't wait until symptoms are bad. However, a lot of posts on reddit are about managing health can't seem to figure out how to fix this acid reflux*, only pain/stool issues. I don't have anything foolproof, but my recommendation is midol (and a combination of my previous tip of eating a lot of berries.) Prostaglandins cause most of the issue, so supressing it before the intestines and uterus contract too much is a good idea. I added berries because you are definitely dehydrated too, and again are high fiber plus easily digestible.

*The heartburn issue is caused by the loosening of stomach sphincters, usually because of estrogen. I have tried resistance training for my reflux personally, but I don't have the same issue exactly. I don't know if my improvemeng is even placebo, though, so its a bit rocky. Further feedback required.


-Always carry water. Then always carry an extra, too. 
Chronic dehydration is a huge issue among adults, most people are dehydrated. You don't want to pee clear (for lack of a better overhydration identifier) but you might not be getting enough. Especially if your diet isn't filled with a lot of plant matter. PLUS, water relieves some physical discomfort or pressure in the stomach. It helps me with everything from nausea to acid reflux to making friends because I always have extra water and supplies for them. Carrying other emergency supplies for random episodes is good too, such as medicine or saltine crackers to calm your tummy. Also for some, going to the restroom can offer relief. Don't ask me why, I don't know. But hydrating can make pain go away slightly faster.

-If you can't risk trial and error, don't.
Not everyone is like me and has had GI issues for years and years now. Some of you will be reading this just after starting to get these issues or don't know what triggers an episode. Point blank, you can't just stop eating or drinking water or living. Tried to avoid eating because I was scared, failed misersbly and just felt worse and more anxious. Especially if you have other things going on or don't have access to fresh or even safe food. Just do what feels right for your situation. Its okay to eat a bit less first or avoid things from fear, but always monitor yourself. Don't let that become a habit, and be a little brave with new foods. Try possible triggers in small quantities. But still, more importantly, do not EVER force yourself accepting something you don't want or can't have, even at the expense of being socially seen as an asshole. There's time to sort it all out.

-AVOID stress directly before, after, and during eating. Not only will you pavlov yourself into dreading food, but it will cause more GI issues.

-Panicked? 
Sit. Or lay down. Then, follow my instructions from earlier about slow and deep breaths, then hold for a few seconds. Blood flows better around the body when youre closer to the ground. White noise or music you find calming is a good auxiliary tool to this. 


Most of this is a way to manage stress or 'anxiety symptoms' rather than specific conditions because, generally speaking, I can't say whats right or wrong for you. I can suggest things like cutting energy drinks, coffee, or sugar but most people here have already gone through the 'obvious' steps and some will find different things work for them than others. Just remember to keep your blood flowing to your brain, aka keeping calm with a steady heartbeat helps in every scenario.

Last tips,
-remember to eat a 'good' breakfast before any tests or exams (something not too heavy like bacon IMO, but small, nonoffensive to the stomach, nutritious, and nourshing.)

-Always talk to someone if it gets too overwhelming! They might not understand the exact symptoms, but balancing health and academics/work is an issue even for people without any health conditions. You're strong, and it's okay to get help.

-I wish you a good day and remember that you will figure it out. You got this! You've put in the work and dedicated yourself well, be proud and confident.

If you want any more tips for things, I do know a lot of work arounds, but yeah I am not a professional and am just offering advice that I find works for most people with GI issues 😎",3,1746357336.0,ChronicIllness,2,1.0,False

They confirmed it today. Epsilon-9 isn’t just passing by. It’s coming *for us*. A rogue planet, dark and silent, pulled into our orbit by some cosmic mistake. The scientists say we have 30 days left. Maybe less.

Mom cried when the news broke. Dad just sat at the kitchen table, staring at his coffee like it held answers. I tried to joke—“Guess I don’t have to study for finals anymore.” Nobody laughed.

The streets are still normal. Cars honk. Birds sing. But everyone’s eyes keep flicking up, searching the sky for something that isn’t there yet.

**Day 5:**  
The internet is half-dead. Memes about Epsilon-9 mix with doomsday preppers livestreaming their bunkers. Some guy on TV said we should “pray for a miracle.” I wonder what kind of god would let a whole planet sneak up on us like this.

School’s canceled. I spent the day at Jake’s place. We didn’t talk about it. Just played video games until his little sister asked, “Will it hurt when it happens?” Jake muted the TV. Nobody knew what to say.

**Day 12:**  
The moon looks wrong. Epsilon’s gravity is stretching it, pulling tides into monsters. Coastal cities are evacuating, but to where? Inland won’t matter soon.

I kissed Sarah today. We’d been dancing around it for months, but what’s the point of waiting now? Her lips tasted like cherry soda and fear. She whispered, “I don’t want to die,” and I lied: “We won’t.”

**Day 19:**  
The rich are launching “escape arks.” Tickets cost millions. Protesters smashed the gates at Cape Canaveral yesterday. NASA called it a “symbolic gesture.” They’re right—those ships might last a year in space. Then what?

Mom planted sunflowers in the backyard. “Might as well,” she said. Dad drinks more. The sky’s gone weird colors at sunset—purple like a bruise.

**Day 25:**  
No more broadcasts. No power most places. We eat cold soup by candlelight. Sarah’s family left for the mountains. I didn’t say goodbye.

Epsilon-9 is visible now. A second moon, but wrong—too big, too dark. It makes the air hum. The dogs won’t stop howling.

**Day 28:**  
Woke up to silence. No birds. The trees are shedding leaves like it’s autumn, but it’s July.

Wrote letters today. Buried them in a metal box under the sunflowers. Maybe someone will find them. Maybe not.

**Day 29:**  
The ground shakes constantly. The horizon bends. Jake came over and we sat on the roof, passing a bottle of his dad’s whiskey.

“Think there’s an afterlife?” he asked.

I watched Epsilon-9 swallow the stars. “Hope so.”

The sky is falling.

1kehc0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kehc0d/i_30f_really_confused_by_his_47m_hotcold/,I (30f) really confused by his (47m) hot/cold behaviour. Does he like me or not?,"We work in the same building, but not for the same company. We share common facilities and use the same cafe, laundromat, gym etc. We also catch the same bus, every couple of weeks. Despite there being around 750 people working in this building, we seem to somehow see each other frequently, probably at least a few times per day.

I first noticed him because he was basically staring at me.. like a lot. There isn’t another person in this building that I see as much as this guy. If I was chatting to a friend over coffee I’d notice him watching me in my peripherals, or walking by multiple times. Or when I’m in the gym, I see him checking me out through the mirrors and he seems to always be working out near me no matter what exercises I seem to be doing that day. Not to sound full of myself, but I’m what some would consider to be attractive looking and tend to get hit on semi-regularly, so somebody staring at me didn’t really phase me at first. He is also really hot and I’m attracted to him. 

However at this point I honestly can’t say whether this dude is really into me, or absolutely hates my guts. I have never met any individual as hard to read as this guy. It’s bizarre. We’ve talked multiple times, yet I’m still no further clued into what his deal is.

He’s a very reserved, quiet-type. Super intelligent (like won national awards kinda smart), attentive, good looking, soft-spoken. He does comes across a tiny bit snobby/know it allish (if I’m being honest), and seems to swing between really friendly to stone cold/kinda rude. Some days he’ll seem really interested in getting to know me, and the next he’ll give me really abrupt, short replies, or blank me. For example, one day he spent about 20 minutes asking me questions about myself. Every time I tried to ask him something, he’d redirect back to me. He’d be super attentive and intent on getting to know me, remembering small details others would usually forget, which I love. It came up that I liked a specific kinda donut, and 2 days later he brought some in (but didn’t actually give them to me, instead he left them in the communal area). I’d also mentioned one time how my I misplaced my phone charger that morning and my phone was dying, and later that day he dropped one over to me. 

Usually right when I feel like we’re really hitting it off, his next move will completely take me back. For example after the above encounter, the next time I seen him I was quickly walking by with a coworker as I head to a meeting (not in his direction I should add so there was no pressure that we’d have to converse) and I had an immediate genuine reaction of happiness to see him and casually smiled and did a little wave, and this guys face looked like he’d seen a GHOST. He didn’t smile or wave back or anything and immediately diverted his eyes away from me, like he didn’t even know me. He does this often and it makes me look/feel like a weirdo. 

But after blanking me, he approached me a few days later as I was unlocking my bike. I noticed that his face was blushing and voice was shaking when he spoke. So of course after this I thought.. ok you’re being silly this guy surely likes you. Why else would he act so nervous like that, and that time we had a nice chat.

BUT THEN, not long after, I got into the elevator with him and a few others and asked how he was and he just point blank ignored me as if I was talking to somebody else? But I was standing opposite him and clearly talking to him lol. In fact, I noticed any time I’m the one to initiate conversation, he shuts it down really quickly (literally one time I asked if he had a good weekend and he replied “yes” and I asked if he did anything nice and he replied “not really” and WALKED AWAY lollllll) . But when HE approaches ME first, it’s usually a long, deep chat. It seems the only times we’ve ever really had good conversations are when they’re on his terms, if that makes sense?

And the more I think about it… he never smiles or goofs around, is always super serious, initiates conversations but never actually takes the conversation to the next level/asks me to go for coffee or a date. He gets nervous and awkward talking to me. He avoids eye contact with me when we pass by each other, and is just super awkward. 

I honestly don’t know if he’s just shy, or if he’s actually really full of himself, or if he just hates me and resents that he sees me everywhere and is trying to be civil. Idk. There’s also the possibility that he just wants to creep on me/my body and has no interest in actually getting to know me.

Thoughts?? How do I handle someone like this? Or should I just forget about him? I like him but the hot/cold behaviour is starting to bother me and although I want to talk to him I kinda find myself dreading running into him because I never know what way he’s going to be.

ISTP - it's amazing how focused and precise you are when you're in a flow state, working on a task or hobby you love.  Your delicacy, patience and co-ordination when working on a craft you've honed is a pleasure to watch.

ENTJ - It's great when you find out about an ENTJ's hobbies or interests, because they will often have stuck with them for years, putting all their phenomenal passion and drive into them, and their enthusiasm just lights them up.

ESTJ - I love how ESTJs can seem all business, but then they get talking about some weird, often morbid interest, and their curiosity shows a whole new side to them that you never expected. 

ENTP - I'm intimidated by how intellectually and conversationally nimble you are. You'll have bounced around 5 different arguments and charmed the pants off everyone in the vicinity while I'm still trying to form a single sentence.  It's both alarming and admirable.

ESTP - you notice everything that's going on around you, and as someone who notices almost nothing that's going on around me, it's like a fucking superpower. Please teach me your ways, ESTP, so that I might walk into fewer glass doors.

ENFP - you inspire me to let my Ne take the reins and actually act on some of my dreams and ideas.  You're open minded and curious, but then you fucking get out into the world and actually follow those passions. You're also underrated as leaders: some of the best managers I've known have been ENFPs.  They came up with creative solutions, led with conviction, and trusted people to get on with their jobs rather than micromanaging. 

ESFP - genuinely some of the friendliest, most accepting people I know.  You seem to make a habit of coaxing more introverted types out of our shells in a way that feels natural, and not like you're taking a hammer to our precious defences. We might not say it, but it's appreciated. 

ENFJ - similar to the ENTPs, your social and empathetic flexibility is both intimidating and impressive. It seems so easy for you to not only tell how people are feeling, but respond instantly in a way that will make them comfortable. It's like watching a professional athelete: I have no idea how you're doing it, and I know I'd never be able to do it, but it's neat for humanity that somebody can.

ESFJ - thoughtful and loyal af, and once you're one of 'their people', they'll do everything they possibly can to make you feel seen, appreciated and comfortable.

INFP - I enjoy hearing other INFPs ramble about whatever they're currently fascinated by. And knowing that they'll likely be kind and enthusiastic about whatever I decide to blather on about in return. That's if either of us ever works up the nerve to start a conversation. 

ISFP - once I get past being intimated by how much cooler you are than me, you make me feel so calm and accepted. You help me get out of my head and into the world in a very low-pressure, easy-going way.

INTJ - I love how quickly and accurately you can arrive at the essence of things. So many times I'll have conversations with my intj friends that go like this:

Me: long-winded stream of consciousness going off in 10 directions at once

intj: oh, so you mean *incisive and witty comment that sums it up in a way I never would have thought of.*

In general, the way you think is intriguing, because it seems so different to how I think. But there's still enough in common to bridge the gap, like how both types tend to be able to remain committed to friendships without regular in-person contact.  And INTJs are some of the most values-driven people I know despite their reputation as purely logical. E.g. if they're brutally honest with you, it's not because they're trying to be mean, they just value the truth and respect you enough not to bullshit you.

ISTJ - I wrote a whole post about why I tend to love ISTJs, but to pick just one point: it's great how when you lead, you do so not through ego, bullshit and appeals to authority; but just by very clearly knowing what you're talking about. So I can trust that if you say something needs to be done, it really needs to be done.

INFJ - I enjoy your niche interests and the rambling conversations we can have, and admire the way you use your Fe harmonising so that it doesn't feel overbearing,  but more like a gentle magic trick.

ISFJ - you're some of the best at creating small rituals to commemorate life events or make people feel valued and seen. Maybe you remind your friend group of a trip you went on years ago, or every Friday bring your co-worker a cup of coffee. And even though I'm not a huge birthday person, it's heartwarming that the ISFJs in my life always remember and acknowledge it. ",1,1746356954.0,mbti,0,0.99,False

This sleek stainless steel, touchscreen toaster promises all the modern features a breakfast lover like me could need—touchscreen functionality, wide slots, memory settings, and even a one-slice toasting mode. While there’s a lot to admire, a few quirks did catch my eye during testing.

**Design That Deserves a Second Look**  
This toaster has a modern, stainless steel finish that blends seamlessly with both minimalist and contemporary kitchen setups. Its compact size (10.98""D x 7.44""W x 6.14""H) means it doesn’t hog counter space but is large enough to house two slices comfortably. I love the touchscreen display; it’s colorful, highly responsive, and makes adjusting settings stupidly easy—even for my groggy morning self. However, the smudge-prone surface means it’s not win-win unless you're willing to keep it polished regularly.

**Features That Aim to Impress**  
The array of built-in features is impressive, starting with the five bread type options: bread, bagels, muffins, waffles, and pastries. The six shade settings make life easier if, like me, you’re picky about your toast’s crispness. Having a cancel function, defrost mode, and reheat mode is a nice touch, accommodating both frozen items and reheating requests. The countdown timer on the LCD display is also super handy; no more guessing when your toast will pop out while you're pouring coffee.

[Check PSIIdan TA1428-UL price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0dm65qfv2/)

**Performance: Toast Made to Perfection**  
This toaster brings 900 watts of heating power to the table. I tested everything from frozen waffles to thick bagels and rustic artisan bread, and the results were consistently even. The one-slice toasting mode was a surprising favorite; instead of heating just one slot, both heat up together to ensure your lone slice gets evenly toasted. It feels unnecessarily fancy, but hey, I’m not complaining. The memory function simplified my mornings even further, recalling my preferred settings with no effort. My only gripe is that the high heat tends to make this toaster warm to the touch, especially after multiple cycles.

**Who Benefits Most from This Appliance?**  
This toaster’s versatility makes it ideal for busy families, singles, or just about anyone who enjoys variety in their breakfast menu. Parents with kids might particularly appreciate the bagel setting and the quick heating times, but the sleek and techy build might also catch the eye of young professionals aiming to upgrade their kitchens.

**Merits**  
- Intuitive touchscreen interface  
- Consistent, even toasting performance  
- One-slice mode to avoid energy waste  
- Memory function simplifies everyday use  

**Critiques**  
- Stainless steel finish is prone to fingerprints  
- Gets warm after extended use  
- Limited to toasting two slices at once  

**Product Competitors**  
Looking at similar models on the market, I tested it alongside the Cuisinart CPT-180 and the Breville BTA720XL. The Breville toaster excels in the premium department with its higher wattage and auto-lift feature, but it's significantly bulkier and feels over-engineered. The Cuisinart, in comparison, is reliable but lacks the sleek touchscreen and the one-slice toasting mode—features I’ve now come to rely on. The PSIIdan device strikes an attractive middle ground between price and features but doesn’t quite have Breville’s finesse when it comes to multimode toasting.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its sleek design and tech-heavy features, the price point is surprisingly reasonable. I can’t say it’s dirt cheap, but given how much utility this toaster provides, it’s a solid investment for anyone who makes regular use of toasters. It competes well with pricier models that don’t offer nearly as much innovation or ease of use.

What is the biggest game changer for the med boards?

Is it a Patok na handout? Patok ng PT? Magaling na teacher?

I’ve reflected about it for quite some time. And here’s my conclusion: the game changer in the med boards, the most important thing that would help you pass or top the med boards is the student mindset.

It all starts, and ends, with the student mindset.

If a student believes that he/she is capable of growth, capable of improving, half of the battle is won.

Difficulties become mere challenges, adversity fuels one’s drive even further. Fear and anxiety become coffee - enough to keep you awake, but not enough to make you rattled. And the everyday tasks become less burdensome; they become enjoyable events.

This game changing mindset was exemplified by one our students before, a then 64-year old EAC graduate named Eman Bautista.

Eman Bautista was a pharmacist who graduated from UP. Because he didn’t have money, and had a family to raise, he wasn’t able to go to med school for decades despite his desire to do so.

When he was in his late 50s, his children finally were able to sponsor his dream of going into med school.  He was kicked out of several med schools, but was able to finish at EAC Med, and did his internship at PGH.

He enrolled with our very first batch in 2007. He was travelling everyday from Quiapo to Fairview and back, which ate up a lot of his study time. He didn’t pass on his first take because much of his time was spent on logistics.

He took the med boards several times again, all these self-studying. He still didn’t pass.

Several years later, he asked us for help, and vowed to fully concentrate for the med boards. We gave him a full financial aid scholarship to lighten his burden. We assigned him a seat directly in front of the teacher and provided him with a mentor.

If there is someone na superdehado for the med boards, it’s probably Doc Eman.

He was financially-challenged. Even though he was given a full scholarship, he still had to sell his motorcycle in order to afford a dorm near our site in Fairview.

He had relationship issues. He live alone at that time.

He had health issues common to people of his age, which impeded his ability to memorize and absorb information.

His grades in med school and in previous  med school attempts were not that high.

He was a repeater, with all the emotional burden that comes with it.

He was 64 years old, and no one has ever passed the PLE at that age before.

But his mindset – it was just different.

He had that unshakeable belief that he can pass the med boards, and it showed in his behavior.

He attended all the lectures (including the post-boards party that we had). He asked all the teachers questions about their lectures. He made friends with his classmates and asked for their help. He was active with the mentoring program.

He was really into it.  He even requested that we place speakers sa CR, para di nya mamiss sinasabi ng lecturer (because of his age, he frequently needs to urinate). He frequently sleeps na at his study chair at home, avoiding the bed in fear of constant napping.

He outworked everyone in that batch.

He was the “class goat” in the diagnostic-midterm-finals of topnotch - the one with the lowest score in all of those exam (so di lang siya red, super-red talaga). But he didn’t mind. He concentrated on the process of learning rather than the immediate results.

He wasn’t able to exercise so much, but he prayed a lot. A lot of his classmates liked him, inspired by his passion for learning.

He took the med boards and answered as best as he can, applying what he learned from us.

During the Topnotch post-boards  party, fully inebriated, he asked me - “Sir, honestly, do you think I’ll pass?”

I told him: “Honestly, dehado doc. But not impossible. You have done your very best, I’ve never seen anyone with the dedication that you have demonstrated. May pag-asa.”

Several days later, I was informed that the board exam results were out. I didn’t search for the names of my friends, or those who could potentially top the exams. The very first name I was searching for in that PRC list is the name of Eman Bautista.

And it was there. His name was in that PRC list. The son of a gun did it!  He passed!

I called him up. He was in Quiapo Church at that time. I told him “Eman, lumabas na board exam results”

Eman: “Ano po results doc?”

Broli: “Pumasa po kayo. Congratulations, DOCTOR Eman!”

… and you can hear someone shouting, crying, laughing all at the same time on the other line.

I told him: “Doc Eman, relaxed lang po kayo. Baka atakihin kayo  sa puso ng wala sa oras. May oathtaking pa.

￼

“

He got exactly 75 as an average in that board exams. 75. But i will take that - knowing how the odds were stacked against him, that victory was just so sweet.

Doc Eman went on to become a general physician in Quiapo, and was an inspirational speaker in Topnotch for several years.

He served his community well and paid it forward by helping repeaters like him in our program.

At 64-years old, he was oldest person to be given a license to practice medicine in the Philippines.

For a superdehado board exam taker, he showed us how to change the game:

Change your mindset. Believe that you can become better, and that you would overcome all obstacles.

It starts from there and ends with it.

Remember what I’ve said during the Topnotch Orientation: “Burn your ships and Conquer the World.”

See you at the Oathtaking.

Your Teacher,

Enrico Paolo C. Banzuela, MD

and the Entire Topnotch Family

I didn’t want to jump straight into paying for something if I didn’t have to, so I spent a few hours reading through free VPN Reddit threads looking for safe options.

I started off trying a random VPN from the App Store and it was a huge mistake ads everywhere, connection kept dropping, and honestly I didn’t feel like it was doing much. After that mess, I went back to Reddit to actually pick from the ones people trust. I downloaded ProtonVPN and Windscribe, which always pop up in best free VPN Reddit discussions, and they’ve been way better. Proton’s free servers are a little slower during busy hours, but no ads, no weird data collection, and it feels stable. Windscribe gave me more location options and the speeds were good enough for YouTube and Reddit without any problems.

It’s kinda crazy how many sketchy ""free VPNs"" are out there if you don’t check first. Anyone else using a solid, safe free VPN right now that’s been working well? Would be nice to have a few more options lined up just in case.",1,1746355987.0,VPNFreaks,1,1.0,False

I think pops of certain cultures and religions should have a higher or lower demand of certain food and drink (staples). The same applies for pops of certain estates. This should be put into practice by letting certain buildings be built in areas with the 'livestock' resource, 'wine' resource, 'fruit' resource, etc.

One building can produce pigs, another can produce cows, and another chickens (example). However, Muslim pops won't buy your pig meat, and Hindu pops won't touch your cow meat. German pops could have a higher demand for your beer (stereotypical, but forgive me) than your wine, while the French will want your wine more. South and East Asian cultured pops will generally demand more rice, while Western pops will demand more wheat based products. The Arab pops could have a higher demand for fruit (which Johan said includes dates).  Catholic and Orthodox clergy pops could have a higher demand for bread and wine than any other pop.

Members of the laborer and soldier estates could demand more meat than other estates because they need the higher calories and protein, while also demanding more hard liquor (like rum). Things such as this can impact your pop satisfaction, war exhaustion, moral, and more.

Let us say that as China, you are unable to produce enough food for your population due to devastation. You import bread from the West to satisfy your pops. The pops consume this, and are saved from starvation, but their satisfaction is not as high as it could be, and their war exhaustion soars because of the restricted access to a 'cultural staple'. But you also lack meat, and you can't buy it. So your soldiers have lower moral due to restricted access to a 'professional staple'.

I also think there should be policies, laws, societal values, and reforms that allow you to alter or add to the cultural and professional staples of your pops. Examples include the introduction of coffee and chocolate that came from the East and the Americas to Europe.",12,1746355927.0,EU5,3,0.84,False

I’m looking for recommendations for places to go apartment hunting in Tokyo. I’ve got a wishlist of things I’m looking for:

A place for a single, 25 year old introverted occupant, that isn’t ridiculously small. Since I am only going 9 months it would be great if it was furnished with at least the necessities like a bed, desk, fridge and a washer, bathroom.

  
Budget is around 200,000 yen per month. 

Would like to be in Central as I would be attending a language school in Shinjuku, but am open to other options as long as I can get there within 20-30 mins. 

Am looking for a place that is close to good restaurants and shops, but isn't just straight flooded with tourists. It would be nice if there was bars as well. I heard Gakugei Daigaku was really nice as it had a good mix of some modern but also had a lot of mom and pop shops nearby. Would be nice if there was some greenery or parks to walk in as I like to watercolor / draw outside. I enjoy dancing along with listening to music so maybe live music or just has a music scene in general would be quite nice. 

Good coverage for food delivery services

I’ve been looking around and have been given some options in the Higashi Nakano area as well as the Gakugei-Daigaku area. Did some research and it seems like Meguro, Koenji, Kichijoji, Shin-Okubo and Shimokitazawa are also nice areas. I've been to them in passing and really only spent time in Shimokitazawa and Shin Okubo. Really enjoyed how nice Shimokitazawa was, lots of nice cafes, coffee spots, clothing shops, etc. It was really beautiful there and I really enjoyed it. Shin-Okubo I stayed at during my first visit to Japan and enjoyed how less noisy it was, just a lot more of a chill area with some pretty good food near it. ",1,1746355924.0,movingtojapan,9,0.6,False

Who are you...
Youve made your expirience, you know who you are, you know what you like and what you need. You crave good communication and its your first step in trying to solve something. You aint a Party person because it doesnt appeal to you, the loud noice, your friends with who youd like to talk to but your voice aint able to scream over the music. The unwanted touches while moving to the beat.

You are able to enjoy the little things more then the biggest suprises. The ready cup of coffee, the Look at you while he things you wouldnt notice. The Grass on your toes. Being able to sit in silence engaged in your own Hobby but still trying to move even an inch closer to each other, finding each other across the room without needing a Word to know that you are enough.

I want us both to be honest, blund maybe, i want to know you, see you, for that i also want you to know me and see me. I want US to carry each other through sunshine and heavy storms.

Who am I ?

There was non-stop texting and flirting. We had two dates before this past Friday, which involved coffee, dinner, and some walking around town. Friday was the big day when we took things further and decided to have sex.

I booked us a hotel as neither of us could host. The whole night was perfect. We had sex thrice, and when I was leaving early, she said, 'Text me later!'

I reached home to cuddle with my wife, and when I tried to text Jess,  I realized she blocked me everywhere. I was dazed and confused and I am unable to understand what has happened. What went wrong?

I never had a feeling that things were not right between Jess and me. She asked about my wife and even suggested that she would be thrilled to meet my wife as they have some common hobbies (long-distance running).

Now that I am looking back, there were some cracks. She never told me where she worked, while I gave her my business card on the first date. She never told me exactly where she lived and always gave vague information about her past. I also feel very weird because I showed her pictures of my family. Was she always planning to disappear? I would have at least appreciated a simple text saying that she didn't want to see me anymore.

I don't have any current medical issues, but I do get migraines. I take 10mg Rizatriptan as needed, 10mg fluoxetine once daily, and 10mg buspirone twice daily. I do not drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs, and never have.

Recently, I've been feeling like I'm really dehydrated, no matter how much water I drink.  I feel especially dehydrated in the morning when I first wake up.  I average about 64 oz of water a day, give or take (I don't force myself to drink if I'm not thirsty, preferring to listen to my body in that regard).

But I still feel tired, achy, get headaches, etc.  I've started to notice a lot of my symptoms are often indicative of dehydration (though I'm sure there are other possibilities as well) and looked for better ways to boost my hydration.

I recently saw an add on TikTok for some electrolyte supplement, claiming that ""normal water"" isn't enough to stay hydrated because it isn't rich in electrolytes.  I'm very cautious about taking advice from TikTok, but I know my sister-in-law drinks Liquid I.V. when she's dehydrated, and I did some research into the topic that yielded mixed results.

Some sources say, ""Yeah, go for it, never too many electrolytes!"" while others claim, ""If you don't need them, don't take them.  It can be dangerous.""

So I'm wondering if any doctors can weigh in on whether an average guy should take a daily electrolyte supplement?  I don't know any intense daily exercise--I do a few minutes of light yoga once a day, and occasionally take a good walk when time allows.  I work in a coffee shop, so I'm on my feet and moving all day, but it's hardly an extreme sport.

Would an electrolyte supplement be a good idea, or should I just try to drink more water even though I kind of feel like I'm already drinking enough to drown a fish?

Also, if you think electrolytes are a good idea, do you have any recommendations?

1kegp2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1kegp2d/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","
I’ve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn’t let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn’t just *my* sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn’t visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn’t see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn’t have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I’d never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn’t ever sure how I knew that, but I’d bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I’d be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I’d wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I’ve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I’m sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can’t confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother’s heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they’d resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren’t so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother’s heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn’t have “the balls” to admit it.

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother’s veins instead of adrenaline or something.

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that’s the rub. Although I’ve always felt like an outsider, that doesn’t mean I’ve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I’ve just never felt *connected* to any of them. I’m like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I’m still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

\- - - - -

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn’t much bother me, though. I just couldn’t see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they *wanted* to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn’t get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony’s too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin’s temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real “one-two” punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal’s office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I’ve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there’s no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.

***The Gallery:***

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”* was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced *e-day*, I think.)

It wasn’t the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie’s singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast’s knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I’ve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie’s head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally.

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze through the holes.

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Adolescence:***

*“What’s the holdup, then? Just do it already,”* seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*“Quinn! What the fuck are you doing?”* Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*“I’ll do it, bitch…I’ll s-shoot. I ain’t afraid. I’ll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor…”* the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*“Yeah, I heard you the first time, man.”*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*“So, do it then. Look. I’m making it easy for you. Don’t even have to aim.”*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman’s bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn’t applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I’d ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn’t let it go.

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn’t experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - -

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It’s like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don’t like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death’s advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

At least, that’s what I *used* to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1. Just because I could sense death didn’t mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.
2. I didn’t know for certain that I could sense *everyone’s* death. There’s one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn’t see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I’ve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up.

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she’d wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn’t that he believed we *could* be soul mates, or that our children *could* be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

I tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I’d harped on since he hit puberty.

Romantic love wasn’t in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn’t a judgement.

He wouldn’t hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a “stuck-up bitch” through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father’s factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*“Listen, Anthony, I don’t think I’m better than you. It’s not like that at all. We’re just different. Fundamentally different. I’m sorry, but that’s never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.”*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don’t think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house’s living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I’d began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I’ve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I’ve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.

I couldn’t detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn’t because something purged it from his system.

He’d just gotten more proficient at hiding it.

\- - - - -

Last night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come “kick the shit out of him” if he heard I was out with an “old flame”.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn’t interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

That made him smile.

Inevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.

I almost reminded him that it wasn’t *his* company. It was his father’s company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.

It might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.

I wasn’t experiencing *any* synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that’s what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won’t lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs.

\- - - - -

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough.

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,* I thought. *I don’t need his permission to leave.*

He didn’t say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.

It didn’t budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.

*“…Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?”* I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn’t much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony’s hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger’s handle, but Anthony’s heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn’t mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.

His foyer became a bonfire.

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked.

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read *two attempts left*

I tried Anthony’s birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened.

I clicked *UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

\- - - -

***The Gallery:***

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked *her* a question.

*“Why could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?”*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the *1-3-4-2* rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.

*“Because he was never supposed to die last night.* ***You*** *were supposed to die last night. That’s what was written. You can’t foretell something that’s never been written.”*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*“But I intervened. You’d never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.* ***We*** *did it.”*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*“Are you ready to see what’s below?”*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo’d through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read *“Happy Birthday!”* in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.

I’d always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn’t. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking.

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it’s been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.

The woman’s newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

*“If you wake up before we get there, that’s OK. You’re finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you’ll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my one-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*”

*“My one and only daughter.”*

Then, I [woke up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",3,1746354457.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1kegomr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1kegomr/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","
I’ve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn’t let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn’t just *my* sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn’t visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn’t see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn’t have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I’d never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn’t ever sure how I knew that, but I’d bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I’d be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I’d wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I’ve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I’m sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can’t confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother’s heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they’d resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren’t so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother’s heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn’t have “the balls” to admit it.

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother’s veins instead of adrenaline or something.

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that’s the rub. Although I’ve always felt like an outsider, that doesn’t mean I’ve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I’ve just never felt *connected* to any of them. I’m like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I’m still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

\- - - - -

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn’t much bother me, though. I just couldn’t see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they *wanted* to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn’t get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony’s too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin’s temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real “one-two” punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal’s office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I’ve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there’s no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”* was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced *e-day*, I think.)

It wasn’t the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie’s singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast’s knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I’ve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie’s head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally.

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze through the holes.

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

\- - - - -

***My Adolescence:***

*“What’s the holdup, then? Just do it already,”* seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*“Quinn! What the fuck are you doing?”* Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*“I’ll do it, bitch…I’ll s-shoot. I ain’t afraid. I’ll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor…”* the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*“Yeah, I heard you the first time, man.”*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*“So, do it then. Look. I’m making it easy for you. Don’t even have to aim.”*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman’s bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn’t applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I’d ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn’t let it go.

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn’t experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - -

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It’s like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don’t like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death’s advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

At least, that’s what I *used* to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1. Just because I could sense death didn’t mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.
2. I didn’t know for certain that I could sense *everyone’s* death. There’s one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn’t see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I’ve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up.

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she’d wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

***My Early Twenties***

In order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony’s falling out.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn’t that he believed we *could* be soul mates, or that our children *could* be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

Romantic love wasn’t in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn’t a judgement.

He wouldn’t hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a “stuck-up bitch” through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father’s factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*“Listen, Anthony, I don’t think I’m better than you. It’s not like that at all. We’re just different. Fundamentally different. I’m sorry, but that’s never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.”*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don’t think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house’s living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I’d began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I’ve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I’ve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn’t interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

I wasn’t experiencing *any* synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that’s what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won’t lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs.

\- - - - -

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough.

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,* I thought. *I don’t need his permission to leave.*

He didn’t say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.

It didn’t budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.

*“…Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?”* I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn’t much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony’s hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger’s handle, but Anthony’s heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn’t mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.

His foyer became a bonfire.

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked.

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read *two attempts left*

I tried Anthony’s birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened.

I clicked *UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

\- - - -

***The Gallery:***

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked *her* a question.

*“Why could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?”*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the *1-3-4-2* rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.

*“Because he was never supposed to die last night.* ***You*** *were supposed to die last night. That’s what was written. You can’t foretell something that’s never been written.”*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*“But I intervened. You’d never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.* ***We*** *did it.”*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*“Are you ready to see what’s below?”*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo’d through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read *“Happy Birthday!”* in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.

I’d always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn’t. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking.

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it’s been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.

The woman’s newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

*“If you wake up before we get there, that’s OK. You’re finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you’ll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my one-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*”

*“My one and only daughter.”*

Then, I [woke up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",1,1746354404.0,CreepCast_Submissions,3,0.67,False
1kego0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1kego0s/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","

I’ve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn’t let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn’t just *my* sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn’t visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn’t see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn’t have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I’d never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn’t ever sure how I knew that, but I’d bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I’d be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I’d wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I’ve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I’m sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can’t confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother’s heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they’d resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren’t so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother’s heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn’t have “the balls” to admit it.

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother’s veins instead of adrenaline or something.

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that’s the rub. Although I’ve always felt like an outsider, that doesn’t mean I’ve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I’ve just never felt *connected* to any of them. I’m like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I’m still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

\- - - - -

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn’t much bother me, though. I just couldn’t see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they *wanted* to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn’t get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony’s too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin’s temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real “one-two” punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal’s office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I’ve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there’s no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”* was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced *e-day*, I think.)

It wasn’t the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie’s singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast’s knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I’ve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie’s head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally.

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze through the holes.

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

\- - - - -

***My Adolescence:***

*“What’s the holdup, then? Just do it already,”* seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*“Quinn! What the fuck are you doing?”* Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*“I’ll do it, bitch…I’ll s-shoot. I ain’t afraid. I’ll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor…”* the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*“Yeah, I heard you the first time, man.”*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*“So, do it then. Look. I’m making it easy for you. Don’t even have to aim.”*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman’s bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn’t applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I’d ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn’t let it go.

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn’t experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - -

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It’s like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don’t like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death’s advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

At least, that’s what I *used* to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1. Just because I could sense death didn’t mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.
2. I didn’t know for certain that I could sense *everyone’s* death. There’s one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn’t see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I’ve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up.

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she’d wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

\- - - - -

***My Early Twenties***

In order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony’s falling out.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn’t that he believed we *could* be soul mates, or that our children *could* be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

I tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I’d harped on since he hit puberty.

Romantic love wasn’t in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn’t a judgement.

He wouldn’t hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a “stuck-up bitch” through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father’s factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*“Listen, Anthony, I don’t think I’m better than you. It’s not like that at all. We’re just different. Fundamentally different. I’m sorry, but that’s never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.”*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don’t think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house’s living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

\- - - - -

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I’d began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I’ve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I’ve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.

I couldn’t detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn’t because something purged it from his system.

He’d just gotten more proficient at hiding it.

\- - - - -

Last night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come “kick the shit out of him” if he heard I was out with an “old flame”.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn’t interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

That made him smile.

Inevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.

I almost reminded him that it wasn’t *his* company. It was his father’s company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.

It might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.

I wasn’t experiencing *any* synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that’s what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won’t lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs.

\- - - - -

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough.

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,* I thought. *I don’t need his permission to leave.*

He didn’t say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.

It didn’t budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.

*“…Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?”* I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn’t much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony’s hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger’s handle, but Anthony’s heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn’t mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.

His foyer became a bonfire.

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked.

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read *two attempts left*

I tried Anthony’s birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened.

I clicked *UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

***The Gallery:***

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked *her* a question.

*“Why could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?”*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the *1-3-4-2* rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.

*“Because he was never supposed to die last night.* ***You*** *were supposed to die last night. That’s what was written. You can’t foretell something that’s never been written.”*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*“But I intervened. You’d never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.* ***We*** *did it.”*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*“Are you ready to see what’s below?”*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo’d through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read *“Happy Birthday!”* in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.

I’d always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn’t. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking.

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it’s been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.

The woman’s newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

*“If you wake up before we get there, that’s OK. You’re finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you’ll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my one-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*”

*“My one and only daughter.”*

ich habe einen ausführlichen Blogbeitrag über die *Tee-Trends 2025* geschrieben und fand ihn so interessant, dass ich die Highlights hier mit euch teilen und diskutieren möchte.

Ein paar Entwicklungen, die mir besonders aufgefallen sind:

* **Gesundheit steht im Fokus**: Adaptogene wie Ashwagandha, Kurkuma, CBD oder Moringa halten Einzug in Teemischungen.
* **Cold Brew & Kombucha**: Kalte Tee-Alternativen werden immer beliebter – erfrischend, mild, fermentiert.
* **Zero Waste & Nachhaltigkeit**: Von plastikfreien Beuteln bis hin zu kompostierbaren Verpackungen – umweltfreundlicher Teekonsum ist auf dem Vormarsch.
* **Virtuelle Tee-Erlebnisse**: Online-Tastings, Teeschulungen und Community-Events im digitalen Raum.
* **Kosmetik & Kulinarik**: Tee findet sich jetzt auch in Hautpflegeprodukten, Teebädern oder sogar als Gewürz in Fertiggerichten.
* **Neue Aromen & Molekular-Tee**: Von Tonka bis Yuzu, und sogar experimentelle Konsistenzen (Sphärisierung, anyone?).
* **Personalisierte Tee-Abo-Boxen**: Immer mehr Anbieter erstellen maßgeschneiderte Mischungen nach Vorlieben.
* **Food Pairing & Lifestyle**: Tee wird zum Ritual – ähnlich wie bei hochwertigem Wein oder Third Wave Coffee.

Mich würde interessieren:

* Welche Trends feiert ihr – und was ist euch vielleicht „zu viel Lifestyle“?
* Habt ihr schon Cold Brew Tee oder fermentierten Tee ausprobiert?
* Welche Tees trinkt ihr täglich – eher klassisch oder modern?

Bin gespannt auf eure Gedanken und Entdeckungen! 🍵
