Now smartphones can be charged from a benchThe development of the Internet of Things provokes the emergence of new smart devices. Street benches have recently been added to the list of things like watches, cars, phones and other 'smart' devices.Solar-powered benches, called Soofa, will appear in city parks in Boston, Massachusetts, USA next week. The peculiarity of this furniture is that it can be used not only for relaxation, but also for charging mobile devices. A wireless internet connection will additionally provide various services based on the user's location data. For example, the user will be able to find out the ambient temperature, its quality and noise level while sitting on a bench in a public park.Your mobile phone doesn't just make calls. So why should our benches be used for only one purpose? said Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.

The Soofa bench was created by engineers from the MIT Media Lab who founded the startup company Changing Environments. This laboratory is known for many innovative developments, including furniture that can change its shape.Soofa was first introduced to the public in 2018. Since then, the bench has received a number of updates, namely, its usable area has increased and the ability to simultaneously connect two smartphones via a USB port has been added. In the future, the company plans to equip Soofa with a wireless charging function based on magnetic induction - a similar technology is implemented in the Starbucks coffee chain.Soofa is the first step in creating urban furniture. The need to update our city for a new generation of mobile device users is long overdue. This opens up endless possibilities,' said Soofa co-author and Changing Environments CEO Sandra Richter.

According to Yahoo Tech, a single Soofa charging bench costs $3,000. The manufacturer also provides a 25-year warranty on the product.If you've read the article this far please like and subscribe - it really helps the [channel.Open](http://channel.Open) the link to find thousands of interesting articles: [https://www.youtube.com/@GeneticsLessons/community](https://www.youtube.com/@GeneticsLessons/community)",1,1739484387.0,nikolays_genetics,0,1.0,False
1iouy4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1iouy4p/public_opinion_on_cannabis/,Public opinion on cannabis?,"Are people in Ireland against the legalisation of cannabis? I find the Irish have a massive stigma against cannabis still and people who smoke are considered lazy, wasters etc, but if you’re in the pub half the week your a “great lad” and “some man for the pints” 

From what I can see, people from all different types of background smoke cannabis, from high up company directors to your general operator and trades etc etc  

What are peoples opinions? I think people will continue to smoke cannabis regardless of laws, so would we be best setting up coffee shops solely for smoking/purchasing plus being able to smoke in your own home and make it illegal to smoke in public? At least then we are generating tax revenue and the cannabis being sold will have to be regulated and tested.  

Any of the “studies” being released by Irish media is pure scaremongering and kind of laughable when you look at any modern society who’s taking turns to legalise cannabis. Of course there is a risk or a harm associated with it, but wouldn’t a legal transparent market take a lot of the risks away from users who smoke? 

Interested to hear people’s opinions for and against this topic but it looks like cannabis will be legalised within the next 10 years so it’s really something that should be discussed. Maybe if England do it we will tag along behind!

1iouxct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Droplet/comments/1iouxct/welcome_to_droplet/,Welcome to Droplet,"Hey there,

Thanks for stopping by—stick around for a bit and learn more about what makes Droplet unique! I’m the creator of this app, and would like to share with you what motivated me to build it, but more importantly, why you should use it. I’ve always been a builder at heart, and when I got into programming my main goal was to  ~~make the world a better place~~ (Silicon Valley anyone?) all jokes aside, it was *to build something meaningful I could share with everyone*. Budgeting has always been a part of my life and has helped me out in so many ways. So I said “Hey, build what you know, it shouldn’t be that difficult!”. Well….it was a little difficult… but after some time (and persistence), here we are!

 Budgeting has been a very powerful tool and has played a huge role in my life, so without getting too preachy I’ll tell you how budgeting has:

* **Financial flexibility** – Without budgeting, I wouldn’t have been able to build this app, learn to program, or pursue other opportunities.
* **Peace of mind** – Knowing exactly how much I have (and where it’s going) makes money feel less scary—for me *and* my partner.
* **Freedom** – Budgeting helped me save, stay debt-free, and make choices without financial stress holding me back. I wouldn’t say we have “F\*\*\* you” money, but more like **“Nah, I’m good”** money.

I hope that by sharing Droplet with you, it will make life a little bit easier for you, and help you along your personal financial journey. It’s a real head scratcher why our school’s don’t teach us budgeting, and it appears a lot of people take an  “I guess” approach to monthly budgeting. If you’re one of those people, I beg you to please spend a bit of time doing the uncomfortable, and start learning some basic budgeting strategies, it will change your life. So, whether you are a beginner or veteran in budgeting this tool will help build habits and perspectives which will help you throughout your financial journey. 

The free version is **incredibly generous**, so you can use it as long as you want—no strings attached. If you love it (or even if you hate it), I’d love your feedback! Leave a review on Google Play or reddit and let me know what you think.

The paid version is still evolving. Right now, I’ve added **expense templates** (so you can set up recurring transactions that generate automatically) and a **simple cloud backup system**. As Droplet grows, new premium features will roll out, but if you sign up now, I’ll **lock in your subscription price for life**—a small thank-you for supporting the app early on.

As the application grows more and more features will only be available for paid members. So if you like what you see, and want to support my endeavors, sign up for the price of a coffee a month. Anyone who signs up now **I** **guarantee you will be grandfathered in** t**o this rate as long as you stay subscribed**, as my token of appreciation to those who helped support Droplet in its early days. If you’d like to be an early beta tester (and we’re still accepting applicants), I’ll **give you a premium member** **for free as long as this app exists.**

Well, that’s about it. Thank you for taking the time, and I hope you enjoy this tool. I put a lot of effort into getting it going, and hope it helps you as much as it’s helped me.

What I'm worried about is isolating coffee. He's very distant, always has been, so he doesn't really come out for pets or cuddles often,He prefers to sit in his cat tree. He'll come down to play with wand toys but if CC is playing (which she normally is) he'll sit back and watch and not interfere.

I've been getting drinkable shots, however, there's a point where I'm moving from acidity to bitterness spectrum where I actually lose any sort of meaningful taste in the espresso.

Like the shot is too acidic, so I grind less fine, the acidity disappears but I don't get any ""sweetness"". It's like it became bland.

1iourwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iourwu/tearjerker/,Tearjerker," 

I showed up to the house half an hour early, but they were already there.  It was an Air BnB they’d had me rent for the night—told me which one to pick because they were familiar and it met their specific criteria.

 

When I asked what the criteria were, they told me without hesitation.

 

No houses within sightline of this house or it’s driveway.  No external or internal cameras.  And no rivers or creeks anywhere on the property.

 

I wanted to ask follow-up questions, especially about the water, but they had already moved on in our online chat session.  They were polite the whole time, but in a professional, almost distracted way that made it seem like they had to squeeze me in between appointments that were much more important.  Part of me wanted to balk at that—I was being asked to pay $5,000 after all—but I knew better.  I was either paying for a scam or a miracle, and either way I was desperate enough to try.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

“Welcome, welcome.  Kim?  I will call you Kim if that is all right.  I feel like I know you well already.”  The chubby blonde woman was walking and smiling and waving as she beckoned me deeper into the rental house.  I could hear an accent, maybe Norwegian, in her friendly voice, and every word was said with hard precision, like granite being warmed by soft hands.  Moving into the living room, she sat down on the sofa and pointed for me to do the same.

 

Once we were settled, I quickly found myself unnerved by having to sit so close to her.  Her eyes were big and pale and rarely blinked, and her lips made a light smacking sound when she spoke.  She was speaking again just then, asking a question I missed.

 

“I’m sorry, what?”

 

“I asked if you are ready to begin.”

 

I blinked.  I didn’t know what I’d expected, but this was all happening so fast.  Between what Paula had told me and the questions I asked over chat, I felt like I had a decent idea of what was going to happen, but in my growing panic I decided to go back over the major points to buy some time for my spine to come back.

 

“So this…procedure.  It won’t hurt?”

 

The woman’s eyes widened as she gave a little laugh.  “Hurt you?  Goodness no.”  She gave a thoughtful shrug as she continued.  “Well, the telling of everything can be very hard, but after this last time, it’ll be done.  That’s the whole point, right?”

 

Frowning, I nodded.  “And you are really saying that after this is over, I won’t be depressed anymore?  I won’t want to…um, hurt myself or anything?  Like permanently?”

 

She nodded.  “When it is finished, the pain that has weighed you down for so long will be gone for good.”

 

“And I won’t turn into like an emotionless robot or something?”

 

The woman grinned at me.  “You kids and your silly movie ideas.  No, nothing like that.  You can still be sad and be hurt, but only by new things, not the past.  You keep the memories but not the pain.  And when you do feel new pain, it won’t be so sharp and terrible.  It’ll be something you can, well, live with.”  She reached out and patted my hand.  “Doesn’t that sound good?”

 

Despite my anxiety, I found myself smiling at her.  “It does.  It really fucking does.”

 

Her smile widened.  “Good.”  Reaching into her bag she pulled out a long wooden box.  Inside was a glass eyedropper with a small black bulb on the end.  She examined it for a moment before looking back at me.  “Then it is time for you to start.  Tell me everything that hurts you.  That makes you want to die.  Don’t stop when the tears come, and they will come.  Keep going until I tell you it is done.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I spent the next hour pulling out every bad thing from the shadowed corners of my heart.  The death, the loneliness.  The guilt and fear.  Everything that was wrong with me, everything I’d tried and failed.  Everything I’d lost or would never have.  By the end of it I was sweating and sobbing and barely able to breathe.  The words were still flowing, but I could feel them beginning to slow, and it was at that moment that the woman grabbed my chin.

 

Tilting my head back slightly, she edged the eyedropper up to my cheek to catch my tears.   She moved with a practiced hand, and within a couple of minutes the dropper was most of the way full.  Releasing me, she plucked a small cap from the box and put it on the end of the eyedropper before stowing the dropper back inside.  Closing the box, she studied me with a serious eye for several moments before asking her next question.

 

“How do you feel?”

 

I sucked in a breath at the question.  How *did* I feel?  Any different?  And if so, was it just some placebo…no.  Oh God.  I started crying again.

 

“It…It’s gone.  It’s all gone.  I…oh God, I don’t know how but…yeah, yeah.  I-I feel great.  So much better.”  I kept wiping my tears as I started laughing, and the woman sat patiently until I got myself under control.  When I could speak again, I looked up at her questioningly.

 

“How?   How is it possible this really works?  Is it a trick?”

 

She shook her head.  “No trick.”

 

I swallowed and nodded, my heart even lighter now.  “Is it magic?”

 

The woman chuckled at that.  “Depending on who you ask, most anything can seem like magic.  The important thing is how you feel.  Do you like how you feel now?”

 

I nodded.  “Oh yes.  I don’t remember ever feeling so…so light.  It’s not even about being happy, though I am happy.  I just feel light and free.”

 

She raised an eyebrow, smiling.  “And not like a robot or a zombie?  Still have your memories?”

 

Letting out a slow, nervous breath, I forced myself to remember.  First small surface things, and then bigger, heavier things that had been eating away at me for years.  I felt my eyes widen as I stared at her.  “No, it’s all there.  And some of it still makes me a little sad or angry or whatever, but not a lot.  It seems more remote.  Safer.”  I laughed.  “Like it happened to me in a past life.”

 

She echoed my laughter.  “That’s not far from the truth.  You’re on a new path now, or you can be.  Do you want to keep yourself this way?”

 

I frowned at her.  “Of course.  And I’ll pay you the money.  More if you need me to.  I just need to stay like this.”

 

Shaking her head, she picked up the box.  “No, nothing like that.  A deal’s a deal, and money isn’t very important.”  She handed it to me.  “But the last step is.  You have to feed your sorrow to another within the next five days.”

 

I felt myself jerk as though I’d been struck.  “What?  What do you mean?”

 

She shrugged.  “Just what I said.  This pain has to go somewhere or it will find its way back to you.  Your tears need to be ingested by another and given time to take root there.  It is your job to find that person and give them your tears.”

 

I stared at her.  “What?  No.  I mean, what does that do to them?  Make them feel the way I did?  That’s impossible.”

 

The woman’s smile faded as she leaned back slightly, her eyes cool as she regarded me.

 

“Do you know how you tried to tell people how sad and depressed you were?  How you wanted to kill yourself?  Had almost tried twice before?”

 

I shook my head.  “I didn’t.  I didn’t tell anyone.”

 

A thin smile returned to her lips as she held up her arm to show me her deeply scarred wrist.  “Neither did I.  My parents, my best friend, my boyfriend.  I'd have told them almost anything else, but not that.  Why?""

 

I shrugged.  “Because you didn’t want them to worry.”

 

Her laugh was harsher this time.  “No, that’s a lie.  It was because we *do* try to tell people.  Maybe not with a big confession or conversation, but we test the waters in what we say and how we act around them.  And we see their surface-level concern.  Their love for us, so long as it’s convenient.  But beneath that, there’s resentment that we are disrupting what they want to do or think about.  And more than that, there’s almost a fear.  Even when they ask if everything’s okay, I could tell they just wanted me to say yes.  As though, deep down, they’re afraid it’s catching.”

 

The woman’s smile broadened.  “Because it is.  Not highly contagious, but able to be passed along.  As you must do now.”

 

“But I don’t want to hurt anyone.”

 

The woman waved away my sentiment.  “It’s not a question of hurt.  Someone, whether they meant to or not, gave this to you at some point.  This…extra burden.  It cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be moved.”  Folding her hands on one knee, she gave a short sniff.  “That can be because you kill yourself, of course.  It will move on then to someone else, someone you *don’t* choose.  Or *you* can actually be in control of your life for once and decide who to burden with this thing.  If you choose well, you’ll find someone that can carry the burden better than you ever could.”

 

Standing up, I started pacing back and forth, cradling the box in my arms like an infant.  “So…I can pick anyone?”

 

Another chuckle.  “Let me save you some time.  It has to be a human.  They have to be alive.  They can’t be on death’s door, either.  This thing I took from you isn’t stupid.  And it won’t waste time building a new nest in a soon-to-be corpse.  It’d rather spend that energy crawling back to you.”

 

I gave a shudder.  “Oh God.  Um…who then?  A bad person?”

 

She shrugged.  “That’s one way to go, though you don’t know what that sudden influx of negative emotions will do to someone that already has destructive tendencies.  They may take it out on other people.”

 

I was growing stressed and upset, but it had an entirely different quality than I’d ever felt before.  I could see the problems clearly, and I cared about finding a solution I was comfortable with, but I wasn’t spiraling down the throat of some anxious depression, hating myself for not having an answer or for trying this in the first place.  After pacing a few more seconds, I looked back to her.

 

“So who do you suggest?”

 

The woman’s face grew more serious.  “Honestly, I’d consider a child.  A baby would be even better.  They are far more resilient and their memories are more pliable.  Chances are it would just get absorbed into their personality and never affect them that much.  Or if not, they may be better equipped to handle it than you were.  It doesn’t affect everyone the same.”

 

I felt my skin beginning to prickle.  “Did you know I worked in the neonatal unit at my hospital?”

 

Her eyebrows drew together as she shook her head slowly.  “No, you never told me where you worked.  But there you are.  A simple solution.”

 

Letting out a small gasp, I put the box back on the coffee table in front of the woman.  “No.  You do it.  I’m paying you a lot of money…and um, I need you to do it.”

 

Standing up, she smoothed her blouse as she spoke to me.  “It isn’t for me to do.  It’s your job to finish, or to not.”

 

Scowling, I picked up the box and thrust it at her.  “I won’t pay if you don’t do this part too.”

 

She cackled and started walking toward the front hallway.  “I don’t care about the money.  That’s just to weed out…how you say…tourists and make people feel they’re getting something of value.  Keep the money.”  I had followed her out to the front door, and as she opened it, she turned around, her eyes darker and colder than before.  “Keep the tears too, if you wish.  Drink them yourself or wait for the thing in them to come back on its own.  Until it is fully nested elsewhere, it can find you wherever you go.”  She turned to leave but then hesitated, and when she turned back, her expression was a bit more kind.  “But think about how you feel now.  Don’t you deserve the chance to really live? Or is the happiness of strangers worth more than your own?”  She reached out and gave my wrist a squeeze.  “Take it from me, it’s not.”

 

And with that, she was gone.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

Pain and sadness changes who you are.  Guilt and fear will twist you to the point that you hate yourself because you don’t recognize what you’ve become.  Didn’t you used to be better than this?  More than this?  Or is this broken, bitter thing what you were always meant to be?

 

Being free of that, feeling like myself again, actually being happy?  I thought it might make me softer and kinder.  More forgiving.  And maybe in some ways it has.  I definitely feel for people that are going through hard times, and I try to help them when I can.  That’s a big part of why I became a doctor, after all.

 

But having this thing taken from me has also given me a lot of clarity.  About who I am.  And what I’m willing to do to protect myself.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

“Hey Doc.  Aren’t you supposed to be headed home already?”

 

I looked up as I closed the door.  One of the younger nurses,  Ryan…something.  He was a nice guy, if a bit too talkative.  “Yeah, I’m about to.”  I hooked a thumb back at the room I’d just come from.  “Just wanted to look in on some of the babies before I went.  See how life is treating them.”

 

Ryan grinned at me.  “They’re babies.  Everybody thinks they’re cute and they get held and fed round the clock.  I’d say life is treating them pretty good so far.”

 

I was silent for a moment before forcing a smile.  “Yeah, maybe so.  Still, pay extra attention to the one in the back.  The Reynolds kid?  Maybe it’s just a fluke, but he’s in there crying up a storm.”

 

The nurse raised his eyebrows.  “Really?  He’s usually super chill.  I’ll go check on him now.”  Moving past me to the door, he gave me a parting glance.  “Um, have a good weekend.”

 

I grinned at him.  “Oh yeah.  [I will](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/).”",2,1739483934.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Ramadan is coming in March and I'm wondering if there are any Muslims (or otherwise) here who won't mind sharing how they'd adjust their plans during the month.

I'm located on the equator so my eating window (from dusk to dawn) is about 7pm to 5am. One of the options I'm considering is focusing my calorie intake when I break my fast in the evening, but the ensuing calorie intake later the following dawn (e.g. dates, as religiously prescribed), would likely affect the outcomes of my IF (e.g. spiking blood sugar and leaving me hungrier the entire day)? 

Alternatively, I'm set on say, OMAD each day at dawn, and focusing on liquid replenishment / hydration at dusk; that way I'm satiated the entire day and can somewhat still go to sleep without being too hungry.

I'm also aware (unfortunately based on past experience) of the ol' Ramadan habit of binging when you break your fast, especially since we don't have the option of chugging tea / black coffee during the day to keep the pangs away. Succumbing to that will be very devastating goals-wise for me.

1ioun8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1ioun8y/ocd_roommate/,OCD roommate,"This is mostly just a vent about one of my roommates, feel free to tell me if I'm the wrong party here.

I live in a house with three women (I'm ftm). Myself and another roommate have rooms in the basement, they are separate. We do not share a wall. I've lived here for about six or seven months, give or take, with generally no issues. 

My downstairs roommate, Jenny, has pretty severe OCD. Like, legitimate OCD. I don't know much about it, but she has a very catastrophic mindset if things aren't done her way. And she's an extreme germaphobe.

Lately I've been getting really frustrated because it feels like she projects the brunt of her OCD onto me (I'm usually the only one home during the day when she gets home from classes.) She goes through my bathroom cabinets– we share a shower and toilet but have different rooms for our sinks and cabinets– and comments on what I keep in them: cleanign rags, q-tips, an empty cup that I keep to refill my cats water bowl, some odds and ends. 

Jennie will freak the fuck out if she smells a candle burning and has in the past banged on my door shouting that the house was burning down. When I assured her that it was just a candle and that I was keeping an eye on it, she said she didn't like that I was burning a candle. I was raised to never burn a candle in a room you aren't present in, and if you ever left the house with a candle burning you would be punished. There was no danger with the candle burning.

When I'm upstairs in the kitchen, she'll often come upstairs as if to watch me which makes me uncomfortable. She seems to take issue with a lot of the things I do, like how I choose to wash my dishes and put them away in my own pantry or how long I leave my coffee in my coffee pot, which is usually about an hour and only as long as I'm upstairs. Recently, when I'm upstairs minding my business and she comes upstairs and sees me, she will scream and grab her chest saying, ""Oh my god you scared me!!"" She does this a lot. At first I thought it was a little silly, but now it truthfully upsets me.

I pay to live here. I'm not trying to make friends. But now I don't leave my room unless I'm 100% sure that she is sleeping or isn't in the house altogether because I don't want to deal with her shit. Her lease ends before mine, but I just don't  know how to go about this anymore. Our landlord sucks.

However, I have a way to partake in a sustainable manner.  Maybe some of you can follow my example.
 
Once or twice a year, I cash in my credit card points for a nice chunk of change.  Each time I redeem my points, I earn several hundred dollars.  That several hundred dollars can go directly to a Domme.  This is the main reason I use credit cards for everything.
 
For instance, this is how the numbers work out.  Let’s say I charge $100.  I get up to 3% cash back, which equates to $3.  Now $3 may not sound like a lot, and it’s not.  But over the course of 6 months, I’ll easily charge into the 5 figures.  So let’s say by the time I’ve charged $15,000, I will have earned $450.  Now that’s starting to sound like something.
 
But there’s more.  When I actually redeem my points, my bank tacks on another 75%.  (As a side note, I once asked my bank to double it—they kindly escorted me out of the building.)  So that $450 becomes $787.50.  Now we’re talking about some serious money.  You may be wondering why my bank would tack on an additional 75%.  That’s because I’m a premium customer.  To qualify as a premium customer, one needs to have a combined balance of at least $100,000.
 
Getting back to my example, I will have earned nearly $800 after 6 months.  So every month, I have about $130 that I can send to a Domme.  I know some of you may still scoff at $130 a month, but that’s the equivalent of a coffee send every day.  What else can I do?  I really don’t know.  This is the reality for those of us who really need to stretch their money.
 
Anyway, I hope some of you found that helpful.",7,1739483232.0,paypigsupportgroup,4,0.89,False

She lost 38kg by making small, sustainable changes. Here’s what helped her:

1️⃣ Eating 5-6 times a day - No more starving and then overeating. Smaller, balanced meals kept her energy stable and cravings in check.

2️⃣ Drinking enough water - She followed a simple rule: 1L per 25kg of body weight (or just divide your weight by 25 to find your goal). It helped with digestion, energy, and unnecessary hunger.

3️⃣ Prioritizing sleep - As a college student, her schedule was a mess. Getting at least 7 hours made a huge difference in energy, cravings and motivation.

4️⃣ Moving in a way she enjoys - She never forced herself to run or go to the gym. Instead, she walked, cycled and did short at-home workouts, whatever felt good.

5️⃣ More protein, fewer empty carbs - She focused on protein with every meal and found healthier swaps for her cravings (healthy high-protein chocolate and chips!).

6️⃣ Low-calorie, protein-packed breakfast - Eating within an hour of waking up helped her stay full and avoid overeating later.

7️⃣ Swapping coffee for protein coffee - A game-changer. It gave her energy without the sugar spikes and dehydration.

8️⃣ Ditching the “all or nothing” mindset - No guilt for eating a burger or skipping a workout. Consistency matteres more than perfection!

9️⃣ Keeping it simple - No calorie counting, just awareness of what she was eating and small adjustments when needed.

🔟 Celebrating small wins! Whether it was fitting into old clothes or feeling more energized, we made sure to acknowledge her progress, which kept her more motivated and boosted her confidence ❤️


Her biggest lesson? Extreme changes don’t last - small and consistent habits do. She still enjoys her favorite foods, but now she has balance, and that made all the difference!",23,1739483193.0,loseit,2,0.85,False

Since it's Valentine's day tomorrow I thought about asking her to grab some coffee or to hang out after school (perhaps even confessing to her), but I don't know if I'm going too fast and I don't want to scare her away. I'll explain the history below; sorry for the essay, but I want you to get a feel for the situation.

It started a few weeks ago when we began having eye contact and short chats in class. I tried talking to her a bit more in class and although sometimes she got a bit shy, she didn't really initiate with me and was always with her friends, so I thought she saw me as just a classmate and I didn't want to be weird and just tried to move on. Now for the last (2) week(s), she's been suddenly initiating a lot of conversations with me and smiling at me a lot, even coming up to me with a friend during the lunch break trying to talk to me. Yesterday she was with one friend and she smiled and waved at me while I walked past her so I suddenly got very nervous, smiled and waved back and thought about walking further, but I thought fuck it literally turned around and went to talk with her. I got a bit flirty (in a subtle way) and she laughed and blushed a lot while having a lot of eye contact (all of this I've never seen her do to other guys).

I thought I'd left enough hints, but the thing is, we're not really best friends or something, and I don't really know everything about her hobbies or daily life. Whenever we talked in class it was mainly about our weekends or I we asked about how our exams went, but it's not like I know her favourite food or the music she likes. I generally want to know about her and her interests, because she's just cool as heck, but it's not like we're in a talking stage or smt. I do have her number, but we've never texted either.

I enjoy driving around, collecting nendoroids, riding bicycle, eating sweets, play sports, watching movies/kdramas/anime and listening to music. If you're interested, let's chat and see if we vibe! No pressure, just good vibes and good company.",1,1739482845.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like checking your Bitcoin portfolio is like peeking into a horror-comedy movie? One minute it’s climbing to the heavens like it’s auditioning for a superhero movie, and the next, it’s plunging faster than my hopes on a Monday morning. Lately, Bitcoin’s been throwing more plot twists than a daytime soap opera!

Just this week, after a tweet from that one mysterious crypto influencer (you know who you are), Bitcoin decided to moon—only to do a belly flop moments later. It’s almost as if Bitcoin is in a toxic relationship with stability: it loves the thrill of highs and the agony of lows, and we’re all just along for the ride.

The current events? Imagine if your favorite rollercoaster got a turbo boost and then suddenly the brakes failed. Regulators are poking around like that one friend who always ruins the party, while memes are flying faster than crypto rumors. And amidst all this chaos, we hodlers are here clutching our digital wallets like they’re the last slice of pizza.

So, buckle up, folks. Whether you’re laughing at the absurdity or crying into your coffee, remember: in the wild world of Bitcoin, unpredictability is the only constant. And hey, if nothing else, it gives us endless material for memes and a good laugh at our own expense.

HODL on tight and keep those memes coming!

TL;DR: Bitcoin’s been crazier than ever—part superhero, part tragic love story, and entirely meme-worthy.

Let the rollercoaster continue!

I've never been very good at explaining things. Whenever I try to get my thoughts and memories out, they come out in random clumps of nonlinear mish-mash. However, due to recent events, and with help from friends and professionals, I have decided the most healthy thing to do is to try to get some of it out in writing. You can't suppress memories forever.

  


Right now the event I can best recall is the exact night when I began to see him again. I didn't know it was him at the time. It started about three months after I the phone call at work that resulted in an embarrassing breakdown, and was forced to stay on unpaid leave until further notice. I'll try to formulate that event into something coherent another day.



I had just gotten home from getting groceries. I felt my body ache and complain about my late nights as I climbed the stairs to my apartment, pushing the key in with my fingertips, opening the door with my elbows, and trying not to drop anything, I was greeted with a very loud meow, and the rapid footsteps of a little monster coming to see who was at the door.

  
  
“Too bad you don't have any thumbs, you could've me with this,” I tell Charlie as I set the bags of groceries down on the counter.

  
  
Her little orange and white face meowed in response. She hurriedly ran towards the sound of rustling paper bags, curious to see what was found today at the discount bin, and jump inside if there was enough space. I wrestled around with her while trying to get everything out from the bags, and after a bit, I managed to sort various cans of soup and pasta into the once-empty cabinets. I put the last bit of food away in my freezer, peeling off red stickers labeled with an expiration date of tomorrow, and then opened the window to let the stale air in my apartment out.

  
  
Trying to keep my eyes open, I shifted quickly through a thick stack of mail before tossing it aside to join a larger pile of unopened envelopes. The keywords and names my mind got used to scanning for weren't there.



Charlie popped her head out to look at me and started to purr as if she knew what I was thinking. I thought that after being together this long she could read my mind, and know exactly what I was thinking about, but with how she is I doubt much really happens inside that brain of hers. Realistically it was probably just her internal clock telling her it was time to start the daily routine we had worked ourselves into over the past few months.  


She bounced behind me as I cleaned the apartment from top to bottom, went through my emails, made my daily meal, checked the locks at least two times, those cheap locks always managed to unlatch in the middle of the night, and then cleaned again before it got too dark. Finally, when the sunlight stopped coming through the windows, we retired to the workroom to try and keep ourselves awake as long as possible. I tried, anyway, Charlie had no issue dosing off immediately underneath the table as I started to busy myself with small arts and crafts projects.

  
  
At that time, I had a lot of issues with my sleep pattern. Every time I woke up I would feel like I had run a marathon, and since I was out of work I had decided that the best course of action for me was to stay awake as long as I could. It had started shortly after I was let go, so I thought that clearly, the lack of my everyday routine must have had something to do with it. As soon as I was able to go back to my routine I would be able to sleep a full eight hours again every single night. Until then I tried everything I could to keep my mind busy.



A random video played on my phone beside me, the laptop in front of me was in the middle of some science article I had stopped reading a couple of hours ago, and arranged in a small ring around me were various cups of coffee, and bottles of cola I had been unhealthily drinking over the night. I've never had any coffee before in my entire life until around that time and honestly thought I was experiencing a heart attack the first time I had a cup. However, over a short amount of time, it lost its energizing effect. It turns out coffee also had a limit to how long it could keep a person awake.  


Focusing on several things strained my eyes heavily. Instead of closing both of them at once and risking falling asleep, every once in a while I would close one eye at a time to give them a bit of a break. I close one of them, put pressure on it with my palm, open it again, and then do the same with the other. Other times I would look up from my desk and stare down the hallway to my bedroom, to give my eyes something a bit further away to focus on for a moment.

  
  
The workroom sat on the other side of my apartment, separating them was a hallway about fifty feet long, splitting off to the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. During the day, from the other end of the apartment, I can see everything. I could see the edge of my bed, curtains, small nightstand, and the red-lit numbers on my alarm clock. Sometimes in the night, when I sat in my chair and looked up from whatever I was doing, I could still make out the shape of everything in the dark.  


Even when it was pitch black, it was still familiar to me. I could focus and make out the shapes of the furniture and where everything was supposed to be. The edge of the bed, curtains, nightstand, the red-lit numbers. If I stared and focused hard enough I could even tell what time it was from where I sat. Every once in a while though the shadows would play tricks on me, dancing in weird patterns to make me think I saw something when I hadn't. The red of the alarm clock became eyes instead of numbers, the curtains arms, and the table a small freakish body. When this happens I would take a deep breath, not panic, and instead, tell myself that I have to close my eyes to let them rest a moment before opening them again. When I open them again I would realize there is nothing there.

  
  
This was one of those times. I stared too long and started to see something form within the shadows. I groaned and closed both of my eyes, rubbed them with my palms, and then took another look. It didn't help, the shadows at the end of the hall still bent, and twisted, playing with my mind. I squinted harder, a heavy pressure bored into my eye-lids, threatening to snap them close again. On the other side of my apartment, beyond the open bedroom door, was a wall of darkness completely unfamiliar.  


Maybe the batteries ran out on my alarm clock. That's why everything looked so confusing. The red of the numbers must have been a sort of reference point for my brain and now that the clock went out I'm not able to make out where everything else in the room was. But this was the exact thing I was worried about when I bought the alarm clock. I was afraid that the batteries would go kaput in the middle of the night and I would wake up late for work. Because of that, I bought one with a cable that I could plug into the wall.

  
  
My stomach sank even deeper as I sat up in my chair, trying to be more alert. I questioned if I had to unplug it earlier for something when suddenly a shadow shifted in the darkness. A piece of black that was a completely different shade of black had sat itself upwards in the void. The pressure I had felt suddenly squeezed my chest a bit tighter in response. I took a hard deep breath, struggling to keep my eyes open, as I stood up from my desk.

  
  
At the moment I felt either a surge of stupidity or braveness but I wanted to see who or what it was. Suddenly the shape moved again, rising higher from its current spot and stopping. The burst of energy I had left my body instantly and I kept my eyes glued to it, not wanting to blink and miss another sudden flinch or movement. I didn't think whoever was there knew that I could see them. I needed to call for help. My phone was charging in the kitchen, and if I was quiet enough I could sneak by, grab it, and call the police to report an intruder had broken into my home.

  
  
Of course, that's what it had to be right? Maybe I forgot to check a lock or left a window open somewhere. I focused hard, forcing my already strained eyes to try to gather more details from stranger. I tried to make out a face, height, or any distinctive, but my exhausted vision twisted the shapes too far. Each limb looked too long to be normal, the legs bent at strange angles, and the arms scrapped the ground. The face, or where its face should have been located, was shrouded in a black indistinguishable from the darkness around it.

  
  
Carefully I stepped around my desk, not wanting to take my eyes off of the intruder when suddenly they moved again. They slid to the right, then tried to take a step but shot their leg too far. It slid out from underneath them, almost sending them toppling over but suddenly freezing before they hit the floor. With a loud crack and pop it slipped back up, resetting itself with one leg forward.  


Panic started to slowly take hold as I stopped fighting against my body. I let my eyes shut and open again and again, hoping each time that the shape would be gone but it still stood there motionless. Whoever it was at the end of the hallway knew I was there. They moved when I moved, and now the two of us stood frozen staring each other down. I raised my leg to make another move, and the intruder did the same, raising a leg a bit too high to take a normal step and let it hover in the air. I go to lower my leg, and the intruder lets his fall to the ground, sliding out from under him with a crunch before pulling itself straight up.  


My mouth fell open, I wanted to shout something intimidating, to lie and tell them I was armed or that the police were already on their way. Anything to break the silence before I planned to reach out and slam the door to my workroom shut. I started to shout, sucking in air and filling my lungs but before anything got past my throat the stranger beat me to it. The shadows where its mouth should be snapped open and cracked, sending a wet tear down the hallway, followed by a faint desperate gasp for air.

  
  
“Meow”

  
  
My chest jumped so hard at that moment that I thought I had died. I spun around in a panic to see Charlie poke her head around her sleeping spot behind the table looking just past me. A faint meow comes from the other end of the apartment, making me spin back around to once again see the red glow of my alarm clock.



Five twenty-three in the morning, cold blue rays of daylight forming beyond the curtains. Gradually the shape of my bed, night table, and curtains slowly come back into view. I take a long deep breath and rub my temple, leaning back against my desk, and finally close my eyes for longer than a second at a time, giving them the rest that they begged for. Charlie purred and hopped onto the table, rubbing herself against my arm and wanting attention.

  
  
“bedtime?”

  
  
Charlie only purrs in response. She's a cat, if someone had broken into the apartment she would have picked it up and alerted me, no matter how quiet the intruder was.



I guess I had no choice anymore. I did everything in my power to avoid it but when it came to visual and auditory hallucinations, maybe it was time to give in and get some shut-eye. Everyone has a limit, and I had pushed mine too much. I carefully took the little white noise machine in my arms and held her close to my chest, the two of us taking a moment to stare down the hallway together before leaving the room. The dark we were met with was empty and familiar like it always was.",1,1739482751.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I've reached the conclusion that making my own water isn't something I really want to get into and I'm settling on cartridge filtration, just finding the 'right' cartridge solution. 

I've used Brita in the past, and now using Phox refillables in a Brita jug. After a little more research I want to try a filter which doesn't just remove calcium carbonate but adds in magnesium carbonate...which the BWT Mg2+ cartridges promise.

Finally, my question...what do the cartridge filters built into espresso machines actually do? I currently have a Sage (Breville) Duo Temp Pro which has a replaceable filter cartridge and the Lelit Elizabeth (the subject of my upgrade-itis) also has a water tank filter. If I'm investing in a BWT filter to remove calcium carbonate and add in a little magnesium carbonate I don't want that magnesium carbonate to then be stripped back out by my machine's in-built filter before I get to taste its impact.",1,1739482615.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

She was in Arcadia City. Biggest city in the world and her birthplace. Large towers reached the sky and cars sat parked in traffic that seemingly never ended.

She hated being here but just a quick pop by to express concerns wouldn’t hurt… right? Either way, where would she start? She didn’t really know who she was meant to go to.

However, she heard a scream. A man who was freaking out in front of an ATM. It was about to blow up from the looks of it. Without thinking she immediately used his technology magic to make the ATM fly into the air and blow up overhead so nobody was hurt.

“Thank hell.” She muttered but various eyes turned to her. She stepped back. Her hand was glowing with her tech magic energy. She gulped and began shaking. People whispered into other's ears.

“Did she try to blow him up?” Someone whispered. “It’s a disgusting tech magic user…” another muttered. The cat girl felt her chest getting tighter… it was hard to breathe… 

With supersonic speeds, she ran up a building and onto the rooftop. They could only catch glimpses of her after images.

People gasped in shock at how impossibly fast she moved. Cameras however recorded her… and people called the police on the cat girl.

Stelina took a deep breath and closed her eyes. In and out. In and out. Think happy thoughts… her lush garden… her favorite show… the world gone. For a moment the cat girl managed to calm herself.

“That’s good.” She said shaking her head and walking around on the rooftops. She looked down at the bustling city below. “I’m just a person.” She whispered to herself.

“Boss boss!” She spoke up. Iris sipping coffee would raise an eyebrow. “A girl with tech magic… she’s superhuman! We got her on camera! It was insane! You need to see it!”

“Excuse me?” Iris stood tall with a curious expression. “Show me immediately.”

In an office, we see a woman in a trench coat and fedora. She hummed to herself as she put down her phone.

I don't like Kelly and the same goes for our parents. The main reason is because she is intrusive and has the main character syndrome. No matter the context or the topic of discussion, everything and I mean everything has to somehow come back to her. You broke your arm, Kelly starts telling how she broke her arm. You tell something about your job, Kelly starts telling stories from her workplace. If we discuss things that she cannot relate to, she will sulk because she feels 'excluded'. We would love to be able to sometimes spend time only with John and have a good time but this is impossible because Kelly will guilt trip him. She inserts herself in everything. I am unable to meet my brother for a coffee alone because she will invite herself over and ruin the vibe. As a result, we see them only for holidays and certain events. John is sad and feels isolated but has a hard time setting boundaries with his wife. It's their marriage, their lives, they know best what works for them. 

Yesterday evening I called my brother because I just wanted to talk to him. Despite this situation with Kelly we are still very close, we message daily, we send memes and videos to each other daily. But last evening I was feeling like shit due to my pregnancy and I wanted to talk to my brother on the phone. We were like 4 minutes into our call when I hear Kelly on his side saying something alonng the lines 'What are you 2 laughing about? Put your phone on speaker so we could all talk'. She was not aggressive while saying this or anything, she said it in a very light way but it bothered me and I told John we'll talk another time and ended the call. He messaged me later apologizing and told me he'll call me the next day while driving home from work so we can have privacy. 

I thought everything was cool until Kelly called me today. She told me that John told her I was sick from my pregnancy and he wanted to make me feel better the other evening and then she started telling me she was hurt by my actions, that I am excluding her and why can't I just share things with her as well. This is where I might be an AH. I kind of lost my shit and told her that I have no reason to share anything with someone who tires me out and annoys me. I told her that I want to be able to have privacy and talk to my brother alone without having her there and making everything about herself. She said that we are family and I should include her and I said that just because she is married to my brother does not mean she is entitled to my time or to have a relationship with me as long as I don't want it. I also told her she is isolating my brother and her obsession with being part of everything is pushing us further away from them which is hurting my brother. 

I know I has a bitch to her, but I am honestly tired of her...AITAH or am I wrong for expecting to be able to see or talk to my brother alone, without his wife present all the time?

My mental health has been the worse it’s ever been. I would absolutely dread going to work. My job was once great(worked in retail in the cannabis industry) it’s a small business and it felt like family. once they opened up a second location and hired more employees, it went downhill. Everyone became clique-y, there’s so much favoritism, and people are getting fired more frequently. Not to mention i got the inside scoop from a friend/former worker there about how awful the owner is and that all of our caring good managers are quitting. Oh and one of the higher up managers is apparently fooling around with a shift leader. My friend even quit due to the girls there making her feel unwelcome and just being mean/bullies and management did nothing. I took a couple weeks off to think about things and I’ve decided for the sake of my mental health, that I should quit. I have a good amount saved up and my fiancé has a high paying job so he can take care of things while i stay home and take care of the apartment and animals. I don’t planned on being unemployed for a long time, I just need some time to take care of myself and find a more positive work environment. (possibly taking a class or course to find better work) 

With that being said, my main concern is how this will affect my future employment. I will obviously have a gap in my resume and I know a lot of jobs do judge that. Is there anything I can add to my resume in place of these gaps so it doesn’t look bad? Can I lie about being self employed or volunteering? My mom has a small at home business, can I lie and say I worked for her? I do want to add that my finance and I are planning on having our own business in the future.

I understand that the GCP is better, but if it needs improvements to match or surpass the Bambino I'm not sure I'd be interested.

I am 80% sure that answer A is incorrect.  
Answer A says that the argument is applying circular reasoning; however, the argument does not restate the conclusion in one of its premises.  
It is true that it does beg the question, but that is a very different type of reasoning error. But even more importantly, there is a much more serious error. Begging the question is still a valid argument, though not sound. The argument above makes an invalid deduction.

The conclusion is that all **coffee drinkers in an office** should pay equally.

There is only one premise, all people who drink the **office’s coffee** should pay equally.

Those are two very different statements. Somebody may be an office coffee drinker, yet not drink the office’s coffee; for example, what if a person brings a thermos of coffee from their home. They would then be drinking coffee in the office, but not be drinking the office’s coffee.

Since the truth of the conclusions cannot be guaranteed by the premise, it is invalid.

The flaw with this argument is that the conclusion is over generalizing beyond the scope of the premise. If it was circular, at least it would be valid reasoning, if not sound reasoning. This argument is not valid.  
It is possible that all of the drinkers of the office’s coffee should pay equally, but even then they still ought not make all of the office’s drinkers of coffee pay for it.  
I think this demonstrates that that answer choice A is wrong, but even if we were to take answer choice A to mean begging the question when it clearly refers to circular reasoning, there is still a better answer choice: answer choice E.

I could restate the flaw in the reasoning just mentioned as it assuming the only alternative possible being people who either are office coffee drinkers **who drink the office’s coffee**, and non office coffee drinkers.  
That sounds awfully like answer choice E. It offers two alternative possibilities but those two alternative possibilities do not exhaust all alternatives.  
I would deeply appreciate if someone where to correct my misunderstanding. I don’t see where I am going wrong. I think the reasoning in my argument here is both sound and valid, but if there is one thing I learned from studying the LSAT, is just how irrational I can be.",1,1739481583.0,LSAT,11,1.0,False

1iottoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/1iottoz/severe_depression_and_anxiety_during_and_after/,Severe depression and anxiety during and after covid,"Hello everyone. 
I had covid in the beginning of January, third time in my life. Symptoms were kinda bad but not as bad as before. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't taste and smell for some time, loss of appetite, fever etc. 
A week before I started to develop physical symptoms, I started to get anxiety. It was kinda bad but I didn't really care about it because back then I started to have some problems in life. I thought it was the cause. 
The more I went in the covid journey, worse I started to feel emotianlly. 
Right now I'm completely in depression, very bad one, I've got sounds sensitivity, I'm shaking out of nowhere no matter where I would be, I'm always tense, all my muscles are tense, I always press my jaws together that I needed to go to the dentist because my wisdom teeth started to hurt. It was from anxiety and panic attacks. Usual things like showering, brushing teeth, brushing hair, cooking, cleaning, going out, taking care of cat, everything became too much. I sleep more than usual, I go to bed at 10 p.m., falling asleep closer to 11 p.m., I can wake up in the middle of the night with panic attack and huge heartrate. Every morning I wake up with anxiety already. 
I reached out for help, first time in my life, I'm going to therapy and then decide about antidepressants. 
I've never thought I can feel that bad. I've never thought it could reach this level. 
Things that didn't and would never trigger me before make me feel panicked, I feel like every smallest problem becomes a huge catastrophe. Like everything is against me. 
Would be nice to hear from people who went through the same or similar experiences, did it go away? How long was it? How did you help yourself?
I quit drinking coffee, I force myself to go out every day just to get exercise, I force myself to cook even if I absolutely don't feel like this but I don't want to eat deliveries or ready meals. I'm trying my best, it's very hard.

My experience and a question about Endo!,"I had my tube removal surgery this morning! Came home and took a good long nap! 😁 Want to share my experience and answer any questions people might have. 
I'm 26 was approved after 4 years of asking!
 The surgery was a breeze and I'm feeling great so far! 

Per op was 2 days ago. Was really a ""are you sure?"" Convention and then she let me know what I needed to do to prep.

Day before surgery: I could only have jello, popsicles, hard candy, black coffee and clear liquids yesterday, and I had a shower with antibacterial soap. I did take my ADHD meds and knocked out a ton of homework so I wouldn't be worried about it during recovery. My hubby went to the store that morning, dropped off my prescriptions for Motrin and some other narcotic. And got me Popsicles, Gatorade, mashed potatoes, soups, uncrustables and a Pizza cauliflower bowl (for when I can eat heavier food). All random but delish foods 😁.
And I got a call that night and was told my surgery was at 7am. 

Day of: I woke up at 5:30 to take care of my dog. Played a Little tug of war And gave her her breakfast.
No food or drink pre surgery.
I showered again with the antibacterial soap, And threw my hair up in a braid (I didn't wash my hair because my doctor wanted my hair to be dry). I was allowed to wear deodorant but no other body lotions or scents. 
We headed to the hospital and I was there at 6:55. 
I was put in a bed immediately and changed into a gown, a cap and grippy socks. 
The nurse came in and put the IV in my wrist because that's where I had the best veins, took my vitals and started fluids on me. 
After about 2 hours she came back in and with the anesthesiologist. She put the leg massagers on and I talked to the anesthesiologist. Nurse gave me a shot to ""dry up the secretions"" And I sat for another 25 minutes before a new nurse came And pushed me to the surgical room. 
My husband was with me the whole time up until the point they took me to surgery.
It was a little freaky in the room while I transitioned from one bed to the surgery table.  Everyone was so nice and they gave me the anesthesia almost immediately (Just before I transitioned to the table). Blew up the leg massagers and then I woke up! 
I woke up about 2 hours after they took me. And there was a nurse at the station next to me waiting. She was very nice and I was surprised to find myself a little emotional (happy word vomit). 
She took my vitals one more time and pushed me to a post-op room. They took my vitals again and gave me crackers and Sprite.
A new nurse watched over me and after eating and drinking I went pee. I didn't flush because the nurse had to check to make sure I went. I was bleeding more than I was expecting but she said it was normal and could last a few weeks.  I got dressed again and they gave me a narcotic. She offered me two but I felt I only needed one. I was shaky and weak but really only felt like i have a good workout, sore in my chest and abs.
We came home and I took a couch nap for a few hours, woke up with a sore throat but a popsicle fixed that. 😁

Medical fun note: when I woke up, my husband said the doctor told him they found endometriosis scarring. Just wondering if anyone else had this happen. I definitely need to do more research and talk to my doctor about it during the post op, But it seems like a new medical journey! 🫡 Could explain alot of pain that was written off as nerve damage.

FMLA/Disability experience: I was filing for FMLA and a short-term disability. I got to call the day before surgery and they let me know that the short-term disability does not cover the pre-op days. I took Tuesday and Wednesday off to prepare and those will be covered by PTO. But the FMLA should cover the whole time. My doctor is going to provide paperwork for the full 2-week recovery. And I am expecting a call from my job tomorrow to confirm I had the surgery. 

So happy and so excited! 😊 Thanks for reading sorry if anything is misspelled or doesn't make sense! Feel free to ask any questions! And please share if you have any info or experience with endometriosis! ",1,1739481228.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

1iotldj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iotldj/how_i_met_angie/,How I met Angie,"
Seeing ghosts isn’t always a scary thing, especially if you’re like me and you’ve noticed them since you were a little kid. I must have  been around 8 years old when I met my first otherworldly friend. I remember waking up during the night to the sound of her footsteps moving softly past the door to my room. It always made me feel a sense of calm and warmth. She was a kind woman, a bit younger than my parents, who loved to sit in the rocking chairs on our front porch while she stared up at the night sky. We never talked much, but I never felt the need to. Her clothes were old fashioned and looked a bit like a maid’s uniform. I think I assumed at the time  it was a costume, but now I believe it was just the work clothes she wore while she was alive. 

For a long time, I wondered if she had been a dream or perhaps some sort of elaborate imaginary friend. However, as I got older I began to meet more ghosts in less easily deniable circumstances. I’d meet them in places like libraries, coffee shops,on the bus, anywhere you might have a quiet moment where the living didn’t demand your attention. I don’t know if this is the case for other mediums but I find it’s easier to try and understand them without speaking. It’s not that they can’t communicate verbally, it’s more that they’re a bit like deer. If you push to hard, move too abruptly, or speak above a whisper you risk seeing them vanish. It makes sense looking back; these were relative strangers who had no real commitment or connection to me. I don’t think they really expect to be noticed or paid much attention to. 

I explain all this first to try and help you understand just how different -she- was. To explain how a quirky but normal part of my life managed to become the nightmare people tend to picture when they think about ghosts haunting someone. 

It was at a party that I noticed her first. I’d met a few spirits in settings like this before and that made sense to me. At a lot of parties it’s  easy to slip in unnoticed and perch like a wall flower away from any dance floor or games. -She- was at the outer edge of the party, but she wasn’t observing passively like other ghosts typically did. It was clear from the moment I felt her presence that she was there with a purpose. I had first felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, which then caused me to swivel to see what had piqued my anxiety. We made eye contact and I felt the pit of my stomach drop instantly. Her irises were a piercing, almost glowing electric blue color . The bruises on her face and blood shot sclera only made that blue stand out more.  Her pupils were noticeably different sizes, like she had some kind of concussion. She demanded my complete attention, as if that targeted glare was the only thing in the room. That was not the look of a lost traveler, no she was here for a purpose and that purpose had something to do with me.  I desperately scanned my memories; did she… know me somehow? 

I must have looked like I was having some kind of silent anxiety attack because next thing I knew a friend’s firm hand squeezed my shoulder.

“Hey you ok?” 

I shook my head, trying to reset myself. The girl was gone as quickly as she had appeared but that look felt seared on my brain like branding iron. 

“Uh yeah sorry, must be Hailey’s edibles, I can’t believe I took two.” 

My friend laughed, “I told you not trust her math about the dosage! Come on, let’s go grab some food to keep them from knocking you out completely.” 

I let my friend grab me by the hand and lead me towards the kitchen. I was completely sober so far that evening but at least now I could pass off any weird things I did on something else. I don’t tend to talk much about seeing ghosts, even with people I’m close to. It’s just not worth it most of the time. They never actually get it and I know I’ll probably just be made fun of. However at that moment I was considering breaking my unspoken rule. That spirit had genuinely freaked me out for the first time, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something awful was going to happen. For the rest of the party I stuck close to my friends and tried to focus on their faces. I hoped that if they found it too weird they’d just assume I was stoned or drunk and zoning out. 

That night, she followed me into my dreams. It was like watching a home video tape of my life, complete with fast forwarding, rewinding and random skips. She’d show up in the background looking at me, the child version of me specifically. It was an intense, fixated stare, like she was mentally making notes and recording every detail. I felt like I was frozen in place, like I was paralyzed. I couldn’t scream, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t do anything. I could only watch.

I woke up drenched in sweat, and I saw a too human shaped shadow behind the dresser. Had the ghost just been watching me sleep from there? I picked up my phone, planning to put the emphasis on the doom in doom scrolling. My dad had texted me at about 2am. All it said was “call me.” I had to take a deep breath. Texts like that are never good news. 

My dad picked up on the first ring. He sounded as exhausted as I felt. He reassured me about the safety of my family after I babbled several disjointed questions. There was a distinct pause before he said softly “it’s you I’m worried about.” I tried to laugh it off, and insisted I was fine. He didn’t argue, he just asked me to meet him at the bar by his house. We’d grab dinner like we use to and talk. I hesitated, but he insisted it was important so I agreed. 

After work I got on my usual bus, and sure enough, the ghost was already there. I wondered if she’d learned my schedule or if she’d been following me all day. I’d thrown myself into my job and managed to literally keep my head down the whole 8 hour shift. If she had been there, I had to believe she was just another grumpy person in the crowd. In that setting I got a lot of angry looks from the living too. 

The bus was quieter, though, and mostly empty. Which meant I had far fewer distractions to keep my mind occupied. At least she had chosen a seat near the back, so I could sit up front with my back to her. The intensity of her expression was bad enough, but she also clearly resembled what she’d looked like just before her death. I’d never seen that before and never wanted to again. I could tell something horrible had happened; her skull was  noticeably fractured, swelling and drenched in blood.  One of her arms hung loosely at her side, dislocated at the shoulder. It was her leg that was the worst part, though. Part of the bone jutted out at an angle, with a sharp, clearly splintered end. 

Something about her glare was starting to feel tangible, like somehow her eyes were generating an icy air current. It was August, so I tried to pass off the sensation as just a fluke of the bus’s AC. I didn’t want to think about how powerful she might be and what she was capable of doing to our material plane. I’d really never met a spirit like this before and I felt thoroughly out of my depth. She made me feel helpless  and out of control in a way that definitely was getting to me.

When I got to my stop, I exited the bus and heard uneven footsteps behind me. For a split second I tried to convince myself it was a normal human that had gotten off, but then I felt that icy chill again.  I wanted to shout and tell her to fuck off already, but didn’t want to make that kind of scene in public. All I needed to make this day worse was to have the cops called on me. It was as if my spectral stalker knew this, because she seemed to move closer. Now I could hear that the footsteps were falling perfectly in sync with mine. I might have thought it was an echo if I didn’t know better. I definitely did not appreciate her skills at mimicry, even with her shattered leg. 

As I stepped off the curb to cross the street in front of the bar, something odd happened. It sounded like the poltergeist had stopped . I didn’t dare pause or glance in her direction until I got to the door, but there my curiosity got the best of me and I just  had to know. Turning slowly, I studied her new behavior. She was leering at me, yes, but there was a new frustration in her expression. Like she was trying to calculate something. I kept my eyes fixed on her as I pushed the door open and entered the bar. 

My dad was waiting in a back booth and waved me over. He asked me about my day and if I’d slept alright. I was honest that no I hadn’t slept well and that today had been hard, but I didn’t tell him why. At least at first. My dad is the kind of person that wanders  through conversation topics so I barely noticed when he got on the topic of my childhood home. “We found out one of the two sisters who lived there at the time worked as a maid up the hill.“ That caught my attention. “Wait what was her name again?” “Hannah” I mouthed her name as I remembered my childhood ghost. My dad must have seen the recognition dawn on me because he said softly, “I always thought you could see her too.” My eyes widened as I looked at my father. He nodded silently for a moment. “Yes, I also see spirits.  Where did you think you got this from?” I didn’t have an answer to that so I just asked him to tell me more. 

My dad explained that he’s also seen spirits since he was little, but it wasn’t until Greg died that he was able to do much with the ability. Greg had been  dad’s best friend. He was a volunteer fire fighter that was killed in the line of duty when I was little. I knew the loss had been hard on my dad so I appreciated hearing that Greg was still bringing him comfort in some way. It also made sense to me that Greg wouldn’t have let death stop him from helping those around him.  “Did you know he always liked this bar, and we’d go out drinking together here before you were born. I think this is one of the places he still spends time.” I remembered my unknown ghost stopping at the street corner and wondered if Greg had something to do with that. Nothing else had seemed to stop her yet, so maybe Greg was the difference. 

“Listen Honey, I don’t want to scare you but something happened recently and Greg and I think it’s important to talk to you about it. I might have accidentally gotten you involved without intending to.” 

“What’s going on?” I couldn’t keep the fear from entering my voice. 

My dad took a moment to collect himself. It was clear whatever he had to talk about was difficult. 

“A few days ago, I was volunteering at the community center, like I always do on Thursday. We were outside in the garden that afternoon…”  He swallowed, pausing for a moment as if  struggling with how to phrase what he had to say next. 

“I heard the screech of the tires and a loud thump. I must have been the closest because I got there first. You know Greg taught me what to do in emergencies like car accidents so I kneeled down beside the young woman who was laying in the road. She must have hit her head pretty hard because there was already blood matting her hair. It looked like it was coming from her ears too. When my volunteer supervisor showed up I told her to call 911. The other volunteers tried to calm down the driver and assess if she had any injuries. I kept talking to the young woman, trying to get her to stay with us. I asked her about herself, she struggled to speak but she said her name was Angie, she lived near by. It was when she said she was your age, that hit me hardest. I couldn’t stop thinking of you. But I… I couldn’t keep Angie awake. She stopped speaking and went unconscious by the time the paramedics got there. A few days later I learned from my supervisor, that Angie had passed away. I already knew because her spirit had come to me first. She was so angry. Silent but just the kind of pissed off that radiates off a person. I felt like… I don’t know quite how to describe it? Like she rewound my memories of her accident. She stopped the film when she saw me thinking about you and I guess kinda zoomed in on it.” He shuddered as if thinking about it still creeped him out. 

“It’s like I could feel her latching onto you. Greg was watching this happen, as by that point he could tell something was up. He told me that Angie was angry her life was stolen from her. She was angry that you were still alive, still happy, still able to live out the rest of your life.” My dad paused, he was grimacing. 

“I don’t know Rachel, I think she’s gonna try to  like, live through you somehow. I don’t know if she can steal your body or anything that drastic, I don’t think she knows if she can either, but I know she wants to.” 

Silence hung between us as I stared down at my food, unable to move, unable to speak, barely able to breathe. I felt tears pricking at my eyes.   

“Dad, what the hell do I do? She’s been relentless, I can’t… I can’t keep doing this.” I didn’t dare ask the question I wanted to. -What if it never stops?-

“I… I don’t honestly know.”

I covered my mouth as I let out a choked out sob. I was grateful my back was to most of the bar. 

“Greg thinks he can help you, but he can’t do it through me. He needs to talk to you.” 

I shook my head. “I don’t… I’ve never tried to… it’s up to the ghost isn’t it? I’ve never like tried to summon someone before?” 

“I don’t know a lot, but I do know we have more control than they do. You’re going to have to reach out. “

“But -how-?” My voice was louder and sharper than I meant it to be. I could see in my peripheral vision a few near by bar patrons midwesternly averted their gaze. Awkwardly I swiped at my eyes with my shirt to dry the tears. 

My dad shrugged dramatically, “some of the old traditions must have a bit of truth to them right? I know he still like scotch.” 

I covered my face with my hands and groaned. My least favorite part of ~adulting~ was realizing how often your parents were just making shit up as they went along too. 

“Wait,” my dad interrupted my already whirring thoughts, and I peaked at him from between my fingers. He was grabbing his wallet. I dropped my hands and watched him.

“Here,” he held out a worn out card, it was the jack of clubs. I gingerly took it from him and looked it over. Before I could ask for clarification he added,
“That was Greg’s lucky card. From the deck we always played with.” 
I could tell the emotional weight the card must carry for my dad. It was with reverence that I gently tucked it into my own wallet. 

“Understood,” I said softly 
My dad was sheepishly avoiding my gaze as he shrugged again. “I know it might not be enough but it’s all I got.”
I reached out and touched my dad’s arm. “I’ll figure it out, one way or another. I promise.” 

By 3am, I was starting to regret that promise as I sipped at an energy drink. Not that I really needed it; fear was keeping my heart rate up high enough that I feel every fluttering beat. Adrenaline was screaming at me to run, to fight, but there I was, quietly  considering  different arrangements of candles. 

I wasn’t normally awake at this time, but I wanted to do everything possible to skew the odds in my favor. The rituals I had been  frantically  scrolling through seemed to largely agree this would need to occur during the so called witching hour from 3am to 4am. 

I had scotch out as my dad recommended. It look me hours of digging through storage to find the  Philadelphia themed shot glass I’d been given. Greg was from Philly, and there was a chance the glass had been his at one point, or at least a gift from him. I’d also driven almost an hour to find the one place close to me that sold any Tastykake product so I’d have a proper food offering. 

I kept myself frantically and consistently busy so my eyes wouldn’t dart to Angie’s lingering form hovering over my shoulder. She was now finding ways to mess with electronics, and the flickering lights were threatening to trigger a migraine for me. However I persisted. This was my best shot, and with her gaining more strength by the hour, I tried not to think about how it might be my only shot. 

At about 3:20, a thunderstorm began to roll in. I heard the rain and thought about how fitting it was. I left my window open (to give Greg some options when it came to entering my shitty little apartment), and could smell the summer night air filtering through. It helped ground me, and drew me back to the summer evenings spent in my backyard while Dad and Greg relaxed and played poker with their friends. I closed my eyes and took several deep breathes before beginning. 

The first step, I had decided, was to place Greg’s card upright, leaning against the scotch and snack cake. The figure appeared to shift slightly in the candle light as I stared at it. 

Next I rose to my feet, and walked to my front door. I opened it all the way and called out, “let all who wish me well enter.” (I’d chosen that phrase to keep Angie from getting any big ideas.) 

I stood there for several minutes, my hand nervously gripping the knob. My neighbors would definitely think I was some kind of crazy wannabe witch after this. But honestly I was coming to terms with the fact that that  assumption might be fair, I mean I was literally trying to work with a ghost right now. For a second I could swear I smelled cologne. That had  to be a good sign too right? Greg had always hated the way you can’t wash off the smell of smoke the first time, so he wore things to cover it up when he was out with his friends. It had been a long time but still that smell felt intrinsically right. I waited until the smell shifted, and then gently closed my door before returning to my dining room table. 

“Greg Hanson, I ask you to please join me at this table,” I gestured to the chair I’d pulled out across from me. It felt so formal and uncomfortable to speak that way but that was what the experts online insisted on. A cold gust came through the window. The candles all flickered and threatened to be snuffed out. Greg’s card was blown over, so it lay face down. I began to frantically shake my head. 

“No not you! Stop it!” I yelled reflexively reaching out and pulling the offerings away from what I assumed to be Angie again. I picked the card back up and held it in my now trembling hand and stared at its little face. I couldn’t keep doing this  ritual. It wasn’t working. I had to try something else. Anything else. 

“Greg, please, I don’t know what I’m doing. She won’t stop, I can’t make her stop. I’m so scared.” I couldn’t stop the tears that were now freely flowing down my cheeks as I let myself sob. “Do you remember that fourth? I must have been like 5. I was holding a sparkler. You told me… you told me not to touch it, but I just had to. It was so beautiful.” My vision was starting to blur but something told me I had to keep looking at the card. I used my shirt to messily rub at my eyes like a child would. “You… you told me it was a burn. God I must have been screaming so loud but your voice was so soft. You were so nice to me even though I did something bad. I asked how you knew what to do and you said it was your job. You told me you protect kids like me everyday. You help them when they’re scared like I was.” 

I hadn’t noticed at first, but the room was now noticeably warmer. I couldn’t tell if it was the tears, the movement of the candles, or something else but the small figure seemed to shift again. Their expression looked just as warm and kind. It gave me an idea. Moving the offerings so they were next to me, rather than across the table, I shakily got to my feet and looked for my deck of cards. 

“I also remember when you taught me to play solitaire. You said it helped you clear your mind,” I said softly, sniffling occasionally as I shuffled and tried to collect myself. I dealt out the cards and took a deep breath. Turning to the spare card I said whist fully, “I’ll try to come up with a way for us to play poker, I always wished I had been old enough to join in, but they stopped playing once you were… gone.” 

My attention was fixed on the cards, as I began to catch Greg up on what he’d missed. I told him about how my brother and sister were doing. I told him that dad had been married again for a year when I was 10 but it didn’t work out. I told him about how I’d failed out of college, but I was going to try again at the community school up the street in the fall. I told him everything you’d tell your godfather after not seeing him for 20 years. 

I must have fallen asleep on the table because the next thing I remembered was my dream. I was still yammering on about my family, and I saw Greg just as he was. Angie was there again too, sitting in the chair across from us.  She was still clearly upset, but now resembled a version of what I imagine she looked like before the accident. 

When I woke up. The shot glass was empty and turned upside down with the card on top of it. I couldn’t find the tastykake at first but then I noticed an empty plate near where Angie had been sitting. I couldn’t help but laugh. 

“I hope this is a truce Angie! You took the peace offering, that means you agree to be peaceful!” 

The cool but gentle breeze from the window brushed against my arm. Shaking my head and making my way to the kitchen I murmured, “Greg and I will hold you to that.” ",4,1739480830.0,nosleep,0,0.83,False

1iothol,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1iothol/my_bislap_experience_long_one/,My bislap experience (long one),"I wanted to share my sterilization experience. I am 35, married, no kids, have had a few miscarriages throughout the years but never focused on having children. 

My doctor is Jessica Serrano-Rodriguez, she is on the doctor list for Arizona. Luckily she is also my usual OBGYN, the conversation came up with her when RVW was overturned, at that time I had an IUD but had to get it removed due to several side effects. The conversation came a lot more forward in November at my yearly exam when she asked about birth control, at this time I explained to her that since I had gastric bypass surgery I can no longer take the pill, and she already knew IUDs were not the answer for me anymore. So at that point I brought up removal of the tubes, and from there for myself it went very fast. I was told someone would reach out to me within a week to start setting things up. 

In early December about a week after my yearly exam appointment I was called to set up my pre-op appointment for late January and also my surgery was scheduled right away too for February 12th. Unfortunately I did have to reschedule my pre-op appointment twice because of my job, but still got everything done in time. 

Pre-op appointment was going over the procedure, confirming I do not plan to have children and all of my understanding. From this appointment I went for my blood work a week before the surgery. 

Surgery day, I had to arrive at the hospital at 645am, surgery scheduled for 845. Checked in at 640am and was finally called back after registration at about 730am, from here is when things started to go fast. They got a urine sample, my usual vitals and had me wipe my body down with wipes and antibacterial soap.

8am fully gowned up and this is when everyone started to come in. Doctor came in first, confirmed the procedure and that I again, don't plan on pregnancy. Gave me the run down of the removal of the tubes, and how long it would take. 815am and the anesthesiologist came in to talk with me as well, all the usual things of side effects and the breathing tube. Once that paperwork was signed I was told we would be going back shortly. 

8:30am is when another nurse came in, and she got me ready to head back. Told her I did need to use the restroom first (luckily no catheter since the procedure was gonna be fast). Anesthesiologist came back in with the funny juice and told me he was going to give me some meds to help my anxiety. By the time we got to the OR doors I was feeling great and on a cloudy lol. I remember the ladies in the OR helping me move to the other table, moving my arms on the little rests and the mask being placed over my face and that is it. 

9:30am is when I was in recovery and finally coming to. I remember slowly waking up and asking how the nurses were doing this morning. The nurses started to ask me questions on my pain tolerance and if I was nauseous at all. In this time they also asked me if I would like a stomach binder, which I remember from my previous surgery and said definitely to get that on. It took me probably another 30 mins to completely wake up though. Throat didn't really hurt, but major dry mouth so they provided me with ice chips and water. 

1030am my S/O arrived, at this time the nurse went over everything with him. All the meds and so on, was wheeled out to the vehicle a little after and headed home after getting some coffee. Forgot to mention I did get pictures too. 

Overall the day of the surgery I did pretty well, not much pain at all. Recovery day 1 I am definitely feeling it though, I am trying to not use any of the heavy pain killers so sticking with Tylenol (can't have nsaids) and that seems to help a lot. Also gas x, and miralax on board. I definitely don't regret this at all, just wish my job and process of short term disability to cover the week or two weeks off wasn't giving me so much problems though. But either way, I am excited for my future, especially given the current climate around birth control. 

Good luck to everyone in their journey!

1iotdjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1iotdjh/why_is_getting_my_way_a_bad_thing/,Why Is Getting My Way A Bad Thing?,"Hey yall
So for context, I'm a straight-forward person who tends to do things independently. For example, if a friend or partner is busy, I will often go do outings or meals alone. Concerts, movies, coffee shops, you name it and I've done it alone.
There was a time where I was too embarrassed to do all that, but I started thinking it's just unrealistic to expect people to be free all the time to do the things I want. And rather than hold back, I've just started going for it and enjoying time alone.

Now here's the issue. The people in my life hate it. I used to get into fights with an ex about how I ""throw him away"" too easily rather than rescheduling or waiting for him to /want/ to do those activities (emphasis on being free but not WANTING to). Even my siblings would say my priority is always to ""get my way"" and that I'm too focused on doing what I want instead of pleasing the people in my life. 

I can understand where they're coming from, but I just don't see why I'm not allowed to pursue things unless I have someone with me. People have work and families, and I'm in a position where I have a lot more free time than the average person. If I waited for people to be free and WILLING to go out with me, I'd be waiting forever. I did try it for a time, and it was just disappointing being told no constantly while also missing out on whatever it was. 

I'm trying to see if maybe I'm missing something here. In my view, life is too short to miss out just because you're afraid of being alone. But on the other hand, people see me as selfish and only concerned with my desires. Someone please give me fresh eyes on this🙏🏻

1iotc5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1iotc5h/canadian_productscompanies_i_didnt_know_about/,Canadian Products/Companies I didn’t know about.,"I thought I did pay attention to buying Canadian. But now that I’m really paying attention, I was not as good as I thought I was. I was just grabbing things off the shelf most of the time as it was convenient. So as I’ve been running low on things around the house, I’ve purposefully sought out things to replace my typical American grabs. So here’s some products and companies I have recently purchased from. If I’ve never heard of them before, and maybe you haven’t either.

Dishwasher soap
I have never heard of the Nature Clean company before. Based in Ontario and they make a whole host of cleaning products. (I am one of those people who LIKE to clean). I bought their dishwasher pods, as well as their multi purpose cleaner. Bye bye Finish and Mr. Clean.

Toothpaste
I was afraid for this one, as I have sensitive teeth and have used Sensodyne for years. Now Sensodyne is not American. At least according to Google it’s not. But The Green Beaver located in Ontario (I promise, I’ll branch out to another province for the next one) makes its own sensitive toothpaste, as well as a lot of other personal care products. 

Bubble bath
Dr. Teals - my go to bubble bath - is American. Now, I have heard of the Rocky Mountain Soap Company (Alberta) before. But I wasn’t paying close enough attention when I could easily pick up Dr. T from Shoppers or order it on Amazon. No longer. I’m looking forward to my coconut bubble bath arriving.

Laundry detergent 
This I learned from Reddit - never heard of Nellie’s before (British Columbia) and it’s been sitting on the shelf in Canadian Tire the whole time. I’m quite smitten with this company (it’s that cleaning thing again) and will likely buy other products soon.

Coffee Beans
I’m happy to say I have always bought from Canadian roasters. In this area, I have always paid attention.  So shout out to Rabbit Hole (Quebec), Black Sheep (Ontario) and The Rosters Pack (Ontario) - who ships me three different coffees from Canadian roasters every month.

Listen. I know sometimes buying Canadian costs more. I’m not saying any of us can afford everything Canadian all the time.  But even one change can make a difference. Vive le Canada!

It all started on Valentine's Day last year when I thought I’d impress my girlfriend with the most romantic gift ever—virtual land in Atlas Earth. Forget roses and chocolates; I was going to make her a landowner!

I proudly pulled out my phone and showed her the prime plot I bought… right in front of her favorite coffee shop. “Look, babe! You technically own this Ethel Caffe Shop!” I said, expecting tears of joy!

Instead, she stared at me. “You bought me imaginary land?”

Nope! Not imaginary! It’s digital real estate! A lifetime investment in our future!”

She grimaced. “How much did this cost?”

I mumbled the price. She gasped. “You could’ve bought me ACTUAL coffee!”

Determined to prove the value of Atlas Earth, I told her  “No worries! I’ll buy more land around places you love—your yoga studio, your favorite mall, your mom’s house!”

That was somewhat of a mistake 😅

She grabbed my phone. “YOU BOUGHT LAND AT MY MOM’S HOUSE?! Why? You planning on collecting rent from her?”

At that point, I knew I had lost. Not just in love, but in real estate.

But hey, at least now I own a solid chunk of land in our town, and every time she walks past ""our"" coffee shop, she shakes her head and mutters, “I can’t believe I’m dating a virtual loser landlord.”

I’m transitioning from maintenance to a cut at around 2000 cals (1m85, 79-80kg). Want to drop about 5kg. 

In my 2000 calories I try to eat around 170g of protein. During maintenance my days and my meals looked like

- 4 days per week 7AM workout
- 10AM 500g Greek yoghurt + 10g jello (300 cals)
- 1PM 275g chicken breast + eggs and airfried veggies
- 4PM snack (protein bar or another 250g of Greek yoghurt with fruit)
- 7PM dinner carbs like rice, pasta or noodles with vegetables and a protein source (fish, shrimp, chicken, tofu)

During a cut I prefer fasting till noon (12~13 pm) for my first meal and last meal around 7pm. How bad would this be if I will keep on lifting first thing in the morning at around 7? That would mean I get only get in protein (and some carbs) around 6 hours after training. Will this be a problem for retaining muscle? Before noon I’d just be drinking coffee, lemon water and sometimes monster ultra energy drink.

Reason for wanting to fast till noon is the fact that I’d like to keep to 3 meals at most instead of the 3 meals and a snack. I’m very scared of getting overly hungry in between lunch and dinner (6 hour gap between them) if I don’t have a 4pm snack. This would mean I could do something like:

- lunch: chicken and veggies
- 4Pm Greek yogurt and jello
- 7Pm dinner

What are your thoughts on this? Is there any other way you would approach this? Like 1/2 tub of yoghurt post-workout in the morning and the other half at 4pm? Any other good ideas to still keep up with my protein?

Cheers!

I (23f) and my partner (25m) been together almost 8 years,I always wanted kids he didn't want them but was open to it at some points I miscarried twice once in 2018 and again 2019  and didn't get pregnant again thought I possibly was infertile as I birthed the second miscarriage at home and didn't get checked up on after due to the mental trauma of the first miscarriage  4 months prior and thought i maybe messed something up .Fast forward 2022 I start looking into it get put on some meds and successfully pregnant by September. 


Background when we first got together I only smoked ganja he dubbled in other things introduced me to some may e experimented ""routineley"" till the first pregnancy and then did it again but alot less often after the miscarriage.( this will be relevant later)

We also have been on and off alot often due to him starting taking cocaine with his pals then those ""pals "" essentially turning him against me because I wasnt impressed with how much and how often at the time. He has a very addictive personality and its a sillpery slope with him.

Anyway we got pregnant had our baby all good.After we had the baby we continued smoking but only one from time to time and always at night swap about when baby was sleeping he eventually stopped.
 
However as the months progressed he started saying he has no way to relax so we agreed he can take it twice a year away from the baby overnight in the spare room.
 
Anyway he started meeting up with our old friend from time to time and this friend is a known bag head no hiding it.With his addictive personality i was worried from the start but i am not his keeper.i just told him not to let me down.well suprise suprise he did .4/5 times he'd go see him for a coffee he'd come back and i just knew sometimes brought it up which either ends in lies or arguments sometimes left it for the peace.

Anyway he went out a while ago after inviting my brother to stay to go grab some tobacco 
We bought of this guy said he wont be long.My brother walked 50 minutes and got here . My bf still wasn't back.i messaged and asked and he said this pal was at his pals house across the road and taking ages to go back to his to get this tobacco.Asked him how long he again said not long at this point I was certain they're on the Tracy again Anyway he arrives a hour later and first thing he does is poop this basically confirmed it as he did it just before he left too.

Anyway I go and just say I know of course denial denial denial.Eventually I said I lit see the white in his nose and he admits it.Argumemt basically says that if I can smoke he can do this.I don't agree 1 . I spend a lot less and lasts me a lot longer 2. I dont gamble when I'm on it like he does 3 .I dont turn intoa c##$ whenever it's mentioned or when I do it.

Although I know drugs are drugs its 2 completely different ones I know smoke is not good either however it doesn't effect how I am nearly as much.Even if he wins on slots he puts it all back in he barley contribute into the house and when he finally did last month (for the first time properly may I add) he's done nothing but throw it in my face since 

Anyway today he came home on his break (he works mostly 10 hour shifts but from 10/12 so he's away most day.Says that above pal has some ganja for ""your mummy if she wants"" bare in mind his pal is also (m in his 50s) then my partner said oh wait no it wasn't mummy.Looked at the text and said oh it was tell Hitler if she wants.

Now this pissed me off for a few reasons 1.Im polish and as most of you know that's probably one of the worst ones he could've picked 2.Because once again he is "" joking"" about with his pals on my expense.

Anyway I went for a cigarette he could tell I wasn't impressed ""what's your problem""and I said looks like history is repeating itself etc this led to again the same argument as per he essentially went back to work before his break finished. (He works 2 mins away from home.)

Anyway after this I've had enough. I messaged him and gave him a ultimatum, his pals and bags or his family.To clarify im completely okay and in fact encourage him to get more friends its just a case of whenever he does its always coke head that enable it and then make me out to be a psycho for not being  cool about it. He essentially said he wont stop unless I stop smoking which again I dont do on a daily.i wouldnt even mind because I'm more than capable its just whenever I do  he then COMPLAINS that I should do it again so I sleep better because he can't sleep unless I do be I struggle to without bc im very sensory overloaded easily and he can't sleep without the TV blaring,and both the sound and light make it difficult for me.Somehow he can sleep with that but not with me quietly scrolling on my phone. 

I told him if I find out he's done it again I won't even argue I'm just calling his parents straight away to come get him and his things.

Below are two samples -- I know they arent the exact same design, but should be close enough. The top is an adult shirt (Printful), bottom is toddler (Gooten).

Upon receiving this from Gooten, I was not happen with the quality in the slightest. I've already reached out as there are parts on all three ducks that are peeling. Is this a one off or is this something to expect from Gooten?

Products that I'm looking for vendors for are:

* Tshirts (mostly unisex, but potentially womens too for a cropped tshirt)
* Sweatshirts (same as above)
* Tank tops (unisex and womens)
* Youth, Toddler, Baby for all of the above types of clothing
* Mouse Pads
* Coffee Mugs
* Travel mugs

My products will all be direct to film (for apparel) as the graphics are abstract and complex. 

I use Etsy and Squarespace so would like to be able to integrate with both as well.

Limoges, Lyon, Toulouse

For context, I'm a nonbinary queer musician (classical and folk) and have only ever lived longterm in suburban college towns. I really like hiking, mountains, arts, farmers markets, biking/walking, and getting to know a community by going to small coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and events. I keep going back and forth between Clermont-Ferrand and Limoges, since they're in the same category of options and both seem like places I would like but I guess I feel unsure about which would maybe be the better option of the two? I saw someone was heavily advocating for Limoges on others' posts, which was encouraging, but I'd be grateful to hear more?",1,1739479175.0,tapif,0,1.0,False

I’m a man who finds joy in the simple pleasures: the thrill of a new Netflix series that sparks laughter or contemplation, the serenity of a mountain trail where the air is crisp and the views are breathtaking, and the invigorating rush of a morning run that clears the mind and awakens the soul. I believe that life is best lived in motion, whether it’s exploring the great outdoors or embarking on spontaneous adventures to far-off places. But beyond the physical, I crave the richness of conversation—the kind that dances between the realms of intellect and emotion. There’s something magical about a conversation that ignites the mind and stirs the heart, don’t you think? I’m searching for a woman who shares this passion for exploration—both of the world around us and the depths of our thoughts. Someone who appreciates the beauty of a well-crafted dialogue, who finds joy in discussing everything from the latest tech trends to the philosophical questions that keep us awake at night. If you’re someone who enjoys hiking under the stars, binge-watching a thought-provoking series, or simply sharing a cup of coffee while discussing the mysteries of life, I would love to hear from you. Let’s create our own story, filled with laughter, adventure, and the kind of connection that transcends the ordinary. So, if you’re ready to embark on this journey together, drop me a message.

1iostx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1iostx6/skull_cavern_challenge_runs/,Skull Cavern Challenge Runs,"No, not the actual in-game challenges. I'm talking about challenges you set for yourself.

Lately, I've been a little bored doing the Skull Cavern the ""best"" way, and decided to make things harder.

My current scenario is to go on a rainy day regardless of luck. I take no bombs or food - just my sword, pickaxe, hoe, rings and trinket. Any edible items found between my house and the caverns can be collected, but I have to go straight there. I don't have any buffs going in, so if I drank coffee or ate something at the farm while doing my chores I have to wait until they pass. I also take the bus instead of of using a warp tower or totem.

That's the baseline challenge, but for hard mode I'm thinking I'll leave behind the rings, hoe (used to get those valuable cave carrots!) and trinket, and maybe not use any edibles found outside the caverns.

Anyway, this whole process has made Skull Cavern dives much dives much more fun and interesting after years of playing the game. Has anyone else set themselves fun challenges for the mines, Skull Cavern, or the volcano dungeon? ",2,1739478868.0,StardewValley,0,1.0,False

Go now, while it's raining and windy and miserable to beat the crowds. Support local businesses, here's my picks:

Nugget and Co-op: Both have chocolates, fancy bouquets, bags of coffee... I dunno what you're looking for! They just have good stuff.

Strelitzia: Our incredible local florist, they have Feb 14 local delivery still available (as of when I just checked). Their Designer's Choice bouquets are always incredible and are discounted, recommend them 1000%.

Trader Joes: Bouquets on the cheap. They get busy around V-day and extend their selection, but ymmv!

Candy House: Lots of truffles of all kinds, they have super boozy chocolates as well as fruit flavored and other types, they're worth trying out!

Sees Candies: They're in the Davis Marketplace (the one with the dancing pig statues!).

PLANTS!: Indoor plants are always awesome, Growing Groves downtown is my favorite. Redwood Barn has beautiful plants (indoor and out) also worth checking out!

1iosqe7,https://i.redd.it/7yx411f0vyie1.jpeg,UK showing of Twin Peaks on Bravo,"*Twin Peaks* was first shown in the UK on BBC Two in late 1990. Four and a half years later, it got repeated on satellite and cable channel Bravo. I don't *think* that channel shared anything but a name with the US channel that gave us *Real Housewives*, and it stopped broadcasting about 15 years ago, but in the 1990s its main fare was repeats of cult TV. It's through these showings that I got hooked on *Twin Peaks.*

I was barely in my teens at the time, but with no friends and a growing interest in things slightly outside the mainstream, I loved it. It helped that the marketing for the repeats was *fantastic*, as you can see above. It might not have been an advert, but I distinctly remember a full page shot of Laura Palmer, wrapped in plastic, in one magazine that I cut out and kept for years. Another advert had ""Twin Peaks, population 51,201"" with the ""51,201"" struck through and ""51,200"" written underneath.

You could also write to the channel and they sent you a guide, which was literally just paper printed off by an office printer and stapled together episode guides, trivia and recipes for donuts and cherry pie. Again, I kept it for years after, and spent the rest of the 1990s watching every underwhelming film that Sheryl Lee, Sherilyn Fenn, Lara Flynn Boyle and Mädchen Amick appeared in.

Customer still hates me for giving him too much change 8 years ago,"So…I’m around 30 (female) and when I was going through a really rough time at home, I found a diner nearby that I could go drink coffee and chat with the old folks when I needed to escape. I got along very well with the owner— he reminded me of my Italian grandfather that passed away. 

At the time, the diner was just a safe environment that meant the world to me. I made friends with many of the customers that sit at the counter, including a 90 year old Korean War vet, a high school guidance counselor, a retired professional boxer, plenty of Vietnam vets and a state trooper. I got to hear so many stories and make so many friendships that I still have today.

Over the course of a few months, things got bad enough that I left home with my little brother, no place to go and needed a job that I could have cash immediately so I could afford to keep us in a local hotel. 

I begged the old man to hire me, it took a couple weeks because I didnt want him (or anyone) to know how desperately I needed that job (not just for the cash but with everything going on I just wanted to be somewhere I felt safe). He hired me and I learned the menu and computers within 2 days, I got along with even the most prickly of staff and most importantly the customers loved me already. 

I was working my first really crazy busy shift around Valentine’s Day, only my second time working on the counter and having an additional 6 booths to take care of. I was smiling ear to ear, making quick jokes with regulars, keeping my order tickets organized and no one’s food sat for more than 20 seconds….frankly….. I was overwhelmed at the time. Overwhelmed as fuck. I was only smiling so I wouldn’t cry. Didn’t stop smiling, never slammed anything, never gave attitude. Nothing. 

I saw the state trooper come in and I actually sighed in relief because this is my friend! I sat with him on so many busy days before I ever worked there. We talked about work and our families and cars and politics. This was my friend. He knew I was new, so maybe I just assumed he’d be more understanding (especially since we’d both saw how chaotic and tense it can get in there.)

I made a quick joke as he sat down, got his drink order, he told me his order straight away (which I already knew), and told me he was in a rush. 

I grabbed his drink, put in his order, brought it to him the second it was in the window. He had 3/4 of his coffee mug full, but was annoyed I hadn’t topped off his coffee within 4 minutes to keep it super hot. Because he was in a rush. I said something like “I’m sorry Dave, I’m doing my best, honestly I’m a little overwhelmed!” And laughed and poured his coffee, then got back to running food and taking orders etc. 

He waved me down to pay his check and it was $11.82. He gave me a $20. I gave him $9 back to save myself time from counting change.

He got ripshit. “I WANT MY CHANGE BACK.” “What? Wait do you need quarters for the meter for work ‘cause your change was supposed to be $8.18, I could change one of the dollars for the quarters if you want!” 
“NO I WANT MY PROPER CHANGE.”
“Ok that’s fine! I’ll need one of those dollars back though—I was trying to round up for you.”

He was legitimately angry and balling up his fists. Kept saying “you can’t rip me off” and I kept saying “Dave I wasn’t ripping you off I gave you more change than you were supposed to get so I could save myself some time. We sit together all the time. Are you joking?”

Wouldn’t speak another word to me. I didn’t fight with him on the extra dollar and I just gave him the extra 18¢. He sent a nasty letter to my boss calling me a thief (ridiculously offensive to me—I’d rather be called a c word) and didn’t come in for YEARS. He somehow got the impression that I moved away and he started coming in again. I was on vacation and had a new schedule. I worked a fill in the other day and he was there. Wouldn’t speak to me. Wouldn’t look at me. Little man jumped into his big ass lifted pickup truck and burnt so much rubber leaving that you could smell it in the restaurant. Got the plate. Called it in to report it since he almost hit someone in the parking lot. My cars tires were missing all of the things that screw on to the tires to keep the air in when I left. 

Turns out…. Dumbass Dave was arrested for DV, lost his badge and his firearm, has no contact with his kids anymore. Not sure if I caused this or if I saved the public from a much worse reaction during a traffic stop. I feel terrible for his family but boy am I glad he can’t legally carry a weapon anymore.

1ioskqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1ioskqw/the_viral_game_a_true_horror_story/,The Viral Game: A True Horror Story,"

Some games should never be played. Some trends should never be followed. This is the story of a YouTuber who chased after the latest viral challenge—**and vanished without a trace.**

# The Game That Took Over the Internet

It started as a **TikTok challenge**—a mysterious game called **""The Doorway Ritual.""** No one knew where it came from, but thousands of users started trying it.

The rules were simple:

1. Go to an abandoned place alone at **3:33 AM**.
2. Find a **door that looks out of place**.
3. Knock **three times** and say, *""I am ready to enter.""*
4. If the door opens… **walk through.**

Most people who attempted it **faked their videos**—it was just another internet hoax.

Until someone did it for real.

# The YouTuber Who Went Too Far

Ethan Graves was a rising horror YouTuber from **Los Angeles, California**. He specialized in exploring urban legends, and when he heard about **The Doorway Ritual**, he knew it was the perfect opportunity to go viral.

His last video was titled:  
**“I Played the Viral Horror Game at 3:33 AM… And It Worked.”**

The footage was **never uploaded.**

But his livestream was.

# The Livestream That Shocked the Internet

At **3:30 AM**, Ethan’s livestream began. Thousands of viewers tuned in as he explored an **abandoned motel** on the outskirts of the city.

Then, at **3:33 AM**, he found it.

A **door** in the middle of a burned-out hallway. It had no dust, no signs of decay—**as if it didn’t belong there.**

Laughing nervously, Ethan knocked three times.

*""I am ready to enter.""*

The chat **flooded with messages**:

* *""Bro, don’t do this.""*
* *""It’s fake, right?""*
* *""Why is the door moving??""*

The door **creaked open.**

Inside was nothing but **darkness.**

Ethan hesitated, then stepped forward.

The second he crossed the threshold—**the stream glitched.**

For exactly **33 seconds**, the screen was nothing but static.

Then, the stream **came back.**

But Ethan was **gone.**

# The Aftermath

The livestream **never ended**.

For hours, the camera kept rolling, showing **an empty hallway**. The chat was flooded with panic:

* *""Where did he go??""*
* *""This isn’t a joke anymore.""*
* *""Call the police!""*

At **4:06 AM**, the stream cut to black.

When authorities arrived at the location, **there was no door**—only a solid wall.

Ethan Graves was **never found.**

His channel remains active, but no new videos have been uploaded.

Except for one.

# The Final Video

A week after his disappearance, a new video appeared on Ethan’s channel.

It was **33 seconds long.**

A **dark room. A heavy breath. A whisper.**

*""I shouldn't have entered.""*

Then, the screen cut to Ethan’s face—**his eyes were pitch black, his mouth twisted into a silent scream.**

The video ended with a single message:

*""Your turn.""*

# Would You Try It?

The Doorway Ritual is still trending, and some claim they’ve found the door.

But here’s the real question:

**If you saw that door… would you knock?**

ThatRubyMoose · Today 18:48

I genuinely want people to be honest; I’m interested in what people think.

About four years ago my brother’s partner moved in with him; she has her own business and works from home. Up until then my mother used to go round and clean for my brother (yes I know). My mother also gets a few freebies from her employer so she would leave these in the house.

When his partner moved in, my mother naturally stopped this out of respect for his partner and not to invade her privacy. However, SiL was more than happy to see my mum. She told her to text her when she was going to drop stuff round.

So for four years two or three times a month, Mum sends a text and Sister-in-Law will stop work, make a coffee, elevenses, or lunch depending on what she is doing and they will have a chat. On the back of this, SiL might find out something Mum likes, so they will go to garden centre or stately home together.

So in four years there has been a handful of times when SiL hasn’t been available, either because she will be out, on a zoom etc. and told Mum to leave stuff in porch. All good, no issue.

On Monday evening SiL texts to say she wasn’t available on Tuesday and just leave stuff in porch. Absolutely no issue.

When Mum arrived there were people in the house and a couple of kids running in the hall so my mum knocked on the door a couple of times when finally SiL opens it and seems surprised Mum is there asking her didn’t she get the text asking her to leave the stuff in the porch.

SiL was with her family and didn’t invite my mum in to meet them. As SiL knows my mum is not intrusive and would not have overstayed her welcome. My mum is so upset but we have stopped her ringing Bro.

So essentially my mum was asked to leave stuff in porch but knocked door anyway - would you have done this?

SiL answered but didn’t invite her in. Would you have done this?

OP posts: See all

I feel like surely you are the SIL from the way you’ve written this, but either way SIL didn’t do anything wrong. She made it clear she was busy and wasn’t available for a visit. She doesn’t have to include her boyfriend’s mother when she sees her own family.

# The Viral Game: A True Horror Story

Some games should never be played. Some trends should never be followed. This is the story of a YouTuber who chased after the latest viral challenge—**and vanished without a trace.**

# The Game That Took Over the Internet

It started as a **TikTok challenge**—a mysterious game called **""The Doorway Ritual.""** No one knew where it came from, but thousands of users started trying it.

The rules were simple:

1. Go to an abandoned place alone at **3:33 AM**.
2. Find a **door that looks out of place**.
3. Knock **three times** and say, *""I am ready to enter.""*
4. If the door opens… **walk through.**

Most people who attempted it **faked their videos**—it was just another internet hoax.

Until someone did it for real.

# The YouTuber Who Went Too Far

Ethan Graves was a rising horror YouTuber from **Los Angeles, California**. He specialized in exploring urban legends, and when he heard about **The Doorway Ritual**, he knew it was the perfect opportunity to go viral.

His last video was titled:  
**“I Played the Viral Horror Game at 3:33 AM… And It Worked.”**

The footage was **never uploaded.**

But his livestream was.

# The Livestream That Shocked the Internet

At **3:30 AM**, Ethan’s livestream began. Thousands of viewers tuned in as he explored an **abandoned motel** on the outskirts of the city.

Then, at **3:33 AM**, he found it.

A **door** in the middle of a burned-out hallway. It had no dust, no signs of decay—**as if it didn’t belong there.**

Laughing nervously, Ethan knocked three times.

*""I am ready to enter.""*

The chat **flooded with messages**:

* *""Bro, don’t do this.""*
* *""It’s fake, right?""*
* *""Why is the door moving??""*

The door **creaked open.**

Inside was nothing but **darkness.**

Ethan hesitated, then stepped forward.

The second he crossed the threshold—**the stream glitched.**

For exactly **33 seconds**, the screen was nothing but static.

Then, the stream **came back.**

But Ethan was **gone.**

# The Aftermath

The livestream **never ended**.

For hours, the camera kept rolling, showing **an empty hallway**. The chat was flooded with panic:

* *""Where did he go??""*
* *""This isn’t a joke anymore.""*
* *""Call the police!""*

At **4:06 AM**, the stream cut to black.

When authorities arrived at the location, **there was no door**—only a solid wall.

Ethan Graves was **never found.**

His channel remains active, but no new videos have been uploaded.

Except for one.

# The Final Video

A week after his disappearance, a new video appeared on Ethan’s channel.

It was **33 seconds long.**

A **dark room. A heavy breath. A whisper.**

*""I shouldn't have entered.""*

Then, the screen cut to Ethan’s face—**his eyes were pitch black, his mouth twisted into a silent scream.**

The video ended with a single message:

*""Your turn.""*

# Would You Try It?

The Doorway Ritual is still trending, and some claim they’ve found the door.

But here’s the real question:

**If you saw that door… would you knock?**

1iosdxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyGlamandRP/comments/1iosdxw/f4m_bollywood_fanfiction/,[F4M] Bollywood Fan-Fiction,"I love doing erotic fan-fiction especially within Bollywood films . This can be any TV show or movie.

For example, imagine doing a cheating roleplay with characters from Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi’s acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It’s shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj’s wife. It’s a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya’s girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother’s old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film…

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi’s hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya’s back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi’s chest a couple of times. He wanted more…

We can come up with different ideas to amplify the already existing objectification (e.g. how Katrina Kaif wearing even skimpier clothes in her songs Shiela ki Jawani & Chikni Chameli).

Kinks: bareback, corruption, cheating, non-con, humiliation, risky, clothes ripping, unintentional baiting, cuckolding, being objectified, partner being GM, barefoot (just me), huge tits, ENF, being sub

One thing I did right was randomly pick Nikki as my barber. She was initially at High Noon, went to King Cut, and just opened up her own shop, Hare Cuts, on 1st street.

Alice in Wonderland vibes, fantastic barber, boutique complementary coffee, and a cheery and fun personality make this the best experience in town.

1iosa1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1iosa1e/this_cold_war_between_democrats_and_republicans/,This Cold war between Democrats and Republicans is wrecking my marriage.,"Every day when I wake up the first thing I do is look at the news. Mostly Reuters and bbc. I obsessively look for concrete evidence that Trump and Elon are destroying the United States. Every day I think I find the thing that will break my husband’s illusion that trump has our nations best interest at heart. He uses the constitution as toilet paper, I text him along with an article about trump seeking to end birth right citizenship. Then I listen to podcasts like ‘Leaving Maga’ I take notes. I read about cults and people who escaped them as if they are instruction manuals.

But for some reason nothing breaks through. I am no stranger to cult mentality or cognitive dissonance. I was raised Mormon and I loved it. Mormonism shaped who I am and a lot of the doctrine resonated with me. Until it didn’t. My exit from Mormonism was slow. Many exmormons describe a singular moment where their “shelf” broke. The shelf is a metaphorical place where they keep all their doubts. I can’t say I really had a moment where my shelf broke. I had to painstakingly deconstruct each Mormon belief one by one until there was little left. It took me four years. And there are bits and pieces that I still hold onto. My husband was patient with me through all of it. He seemed to be leaps ahead of me in the deconstruction process. How could he be so patient with me through all of that even when I judged him harshly for drinking coffee? He was gentle during late night talks about marijuana, alcohol, coffee, sex and more. I’m so thankful that he never pushed me to mental places when I wasn’t ready. I am grateful and want to do the same for him. But it’s hard.

Even now my closest siblings are liberal Mormons. They hate trump like me but still practice Mormonism. For some reason I find it a lot easier to have grace for them than for my trumpie in laws. I have to remind myself that Mormonism is quite authoritarian. Many of the beliefs I had growing up were quite facist. Us vs them. A romanticization of the past, a belief in ‘traditional families’. Some of the same things I hate about the trump administration. If my husband were to go back to Mormonism I would be ok as long as he didn’t force his opinions on me. Why then am I obsessed with breaking him out of the cult of trump?

I find it almost impossible to restrain myself from sending him articles every day. I read books about facism and tell him bits about it hoping he will connect the dots back to trump. The odd thing is his political beliefs typically align with mine when trump isn’t in the picture. He’s pro Palestine, pro abortion, supports free healthcare, doesn’t subscribe to gender roles, does the majority of our housework and more. But then when he says he likes trump I’m sick. How could I possibly be married to someone who believes so differently than me? How did I get here? 

Recently I wanted to talk politics with him. I want to understand why he supports trump even tho he wouldn’t support anyone else who did what trump is doing. After a heated fight he told me he just wants to stay ignorant. He wants to live his life worrying about things he can control not what he can’t change. He said he wishes we could just go to church and enjoy the community and pretend it’s true even tho it isn’t. I know that to most ppl that will sound disgusting. To me it was a glimmer of hope. I want him to put Mormonism and trump in the same box bc if we can deconstruct Mormonism we can deconstruct this too. 

I also have no real fear that he will get into Mormonism again. I don’t think either of us could believe if we wanted to. And he gets so board at church and is addicted to coffee and weed so it would be a difficult road back for someone who is just pretending to believe. 

I don’t expect anyone to forgive my husband for voting trump into office. I know a lot of people don’t have the emotional bandwidth to have those conversations and they shouldn’t have to. But I see a way out of this for my husband if I’m just patient. I get glimmers of hope sometimes and I think this too will pass. After all my husband often says that if the next four years are bad he will admit I’ve been right all along. 

Last disclaimer: I’m expecting lots of mixed responses, some saying I should divorce my husband and others saying I suck bc it isn’t right to stay with someone in hopes that they will change. I know. Please be gentle with me Reddit
