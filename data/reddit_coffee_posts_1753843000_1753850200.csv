1mcxb0o,https://i.redd.it/a31pzrvusxff1.jpeg,I flew to Vietnam from India just to buy a MacBook,"Hey folks,

A while back I posted on a few subreddits about an idea I had. Flying from India to Vietnam, buying a MacBook there, and coming back... hopefully saving some cash. A few people said it’s doable, but many suggested I should explore Vietnam too, so I did. 😎

If you’re planning to buy a MacBook or iPhone worth ₹2 lakh+ in India trust me it's worth making a short trip to Vietnam. You’ll get the device cheaper *and* squeeze in a mini vacation.

# My Story & Experience

* Got my eVisa, booked the cheapest round-trip flight (₹19K), and headed to Hanoi, the capital.
* Stayed 11 nights (was working remotely not recommended, But I had good time. more on that later).
* Explored nearby places on weekends or evenings, and yes bought my MacBook there!

# Tips from Experience

* **Don’t take your work laptop** and plan to “work and travel.” Just take 4-7 days off and enjoy. You won’t cover the entire country anyway.
* I only traveled for 5 days during my 11-night stay and honestly, that was more than enough for a refreshing experience.

# Where I Bought My MacBook

After visiting more than 15 stores in nearby areas.

✅ **Good Store (Price matched FPT, gave tax refund document)**:  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/dyqNYEwGxLjtjEsFA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dyqNYEwGxLjtjEsFA)

❌ **Bad Store (Overpriced, and was bargaining in MAcBook - Is this vegetable shop?)**:  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/QP2NcH4P5MToqBC26](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QP2NcH4P5MToqBC26)

* Always ask: “Do you provide VAT refund documents for the airport?” Some stores won’t.
* They even helped me *carefully* open the MacBook to inspect it and resealed it for airport VAT refund smart move!
* **VAT Refund Counter:** Noi Bai Airport, Gate No. 31. I got back \~$111 (8.5% minus charges).

# Cost Breakdown

|Item|Cost (INR)|
|:-|:-|
|Round trip flight|₹19,000|
|E-Visa|₹2,210|
|Ha Long Bay|₹5,500|
|Ninh Binh|₹4,500|
|Stay (11 nights)|₹4,000|
|Food & Extra|₹5,000|
|**Total Trip**|**\~₹40,000**|

# The MacBook Deal

* **MacBook Pro M4 14"" (Base)**
   * **India (Amazon):** ₹1,89,900
   * **With card offers:** \~₹1,85,000
   * **Vietnam (after refund):** \~₹1,48,500 (I paid total ₹1,58,125 at store and got $111 refund at airport )

**🧮 Net Savings on MacBook alone: ₹36,500**  
So basically, add ₹5K and you got yourself a brand-new MacBook *and* a vacation in Vietnam.

# If You Plan To Do This, Read This First:

* 🍜 Vegetarian? Food hunt might be tricky. Double check *every time* (It's expensive)
* ☕ Must try *Coconut Coffee*
* 🚌 Public transport in Hanoi is **super cheap** and reliable. Google Maps + their local apps are just too good. Just show the conductor your destination. (This will save fuck loads of money)
* 💳 Get a **forex card**, pay via card wherever you can.
* 💵 Cash still needed for small/local places & ticket counters.
* ☔ Avoid rainy season (I got hit by WiFa storm, couldn’t go to Sapa).
* 🛍️ Use FPT Shop’s website to check legit Mac pricing.
* 🚴🏻Download Grab (Helps with cab, bike, food, groceries)

# Final Total I Spent

* **MacBook + 11-day trip total:** ₹2,08,117 (before refund)
* **After tax refund:** ₹1,97,000 approx.
* So if I deduct the cost of the MacBook alone, my 11-night Vietnam trip was just ₹48K and that too while working!

Feel free to ask if you're planning a similar trip happy to share more deets. 😄  
Hope this helps someone out there save money and gain memories!

If you want to get a Mac device at a lower price but don’t want to fly to Vietnam yourself I’ve got you.

**Sponsor my trip with ₹15K–₹20K**, and I’ll go pick it up for you. I can fly in, buy the device, and return the same or next day. You’ll still end up saving ₹15K–₹20K *per device* based on what you are getting.

This works best if **2–3 people** are looking to buy MacBooks, iPhones, or iPads. Just drop me a message if you're interested happy to make it happen. 😊",1,1753850074.0,macoffer,0,1.0,False
1mcxa1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1mcxa1k/everyone_might_have_applied_this_discipline_hack/,"Everyone might have applied this Discipline Hack, just unaware of it.","My brain is basically immune to to-do apps, planners, alarms, and my own good intentions. These recent years, I would be paralyzed by simple tasks like doing the dishes or folding my clothes, knowing I should do them but being physically unable to, unless my mother scolds me to do it. That's where this external accountability system started.

My first recall of ever actively applying it was some time ago in high school, I made a verbal deal with my best friend, if I don't confess to my crush after school, I buy him coffee the next morning. Suddenly, the consequence for failing was real and immediate. So i did it. Guess what, I got rejected. But its far far better than inaction and regrets. 

It feels like the only language my brain understands is consequences. I just realized that term now from Atomic Habits and some old articles about loss aversion. Everyone had their ""Stake"", we were just unaware when we had applied it, sometime in our lives when we rely on an external accountability to overcome our own willpower.",1,1753849981.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

We didn’t really talk on the way back. Just watched the road and trees crawl on and on. It was a long way back into town. The others made us slow, Mark limped, his leg hastily bandaged up, and Adi trudged hunched over, beneath his ragged shirt deep gashes pulled at his back and shoulders. I got off the lightest with only a line of bruises across my torso. But even so, I wanted more than anything to fall into bed and sleep for a long time.

It was Sunday morning and town was quiet. Adi turned off first down his street and soon after I farewelled Mark and headed west towards home. The lines of oaks moved in the wind. Leaves fell, still green with summer, across the immense tarmac and wide immaculate lawns. Most cars still sat in their driveways, it was far too early and far too cold to get out of bed. A brave few were out, empty lots outside empty homes.

Our house stood small and sickly blue and white. I fumbled for my key. I’d meant to be back in time for church, but we were delayed. There were, of course, going to be the questions and scowls and tellings-off, but I wasn’t worried. This time was no different. We had been through the big song and dance before. I’d find myself at evening service instead and perhaps confession and it’d be never spoken of again.

I dragged myself upstairs into the shower and scoured my wounds. The water was gloriously warm with no one else to compete with. I let my bruises soak and melt away, let myself breathe the humid air and push out a sigh. Felt the heat once again fill me. The water fell on my face. It was a long time before it ran cold, and my thoughts went back along our return walk, out into the forest. Out to where we had hiked, a hut in the pines, a fire, dinner, drinks. As I stepped out of the shower I stumbled, grabbing, grasping at the glass, feet sliding on wet tile. I fell short of the cabinet, hard onto the floor. My skull only an inch from cracking itself open on the vanity. But my chest and knees were not so spared, the bruises I had just washed away were again sprouting, black and aching across my body. 

I hobbled to the bedroom and found something in the wardrobe. But as I turned to the mirror the room seemed different than as I’d left it yesterday. I checked the false drawer in the bedside dresser was still locked and the hole beneath the bed still concealed. Someone had certainly tidied up. But it wasn’t just that. It felt like I’d been away a lot longer. The smell was different. Like all the air had been replaced. Something. I looked at the bed and it took every effort to not fall face first into sleep. The blankets were pulled tight, not a crease was visible, like it had never been slept in. I shook the feeling away. I left the room behind and went down painfully for food.

Sunday was grocery day so there was very little for breakfast. I found only a single grapefruit and the last couple slices of bread, sad and stale. At the table I sprinkled sugar and scraped butter. The kettle boiled and I poured the coffee pot. Maybe I ought to go to bed to avoid the confrontation, I could hop in now and be asleep before they return. Either way I need to clean up before they are back or that’ll be another thing Mum can complain about, her immaculate counter dirtied with dust, and I probably scratched the plate too. I finished the toast and started on the fruit and was no more than a few bites in when they arrived. The car didn’t make much sound, coming in smooth and silent. The doors slammed and their voices, hushed and muffled, came slowly to the front door. Their key seemed to struggle, the lock sticking even more than it always had, and the bottom of the door caught on the sill. It took a solid kick to dislodge it, and the three of them tumbled inwards. Dad in his suit, Mum her coat and heels, and Warren in the trousers that collected on his shoes. Mum was the first one to see me. I swallowed.

“Hi…,” she said, “are you here with Giles?”

I looked up nonchalantly from my food to the three of them standing surprised in the entrance hall. You could tell the service had run long, they had the impatient scowls that form when the priest tries to go on about in the homily, those knotted edges of your cheeks that take the rest of the day to unfurl.

“Hi guys,” I said, “I just got home—”

“—Sorry, is Giles here too?” Mum said.

“Ah… what?”

“Who are you? Where is Giles?”

“What? What are you doing Mum?”

She turned to Dad. “Darling…” She put her hand on his arm.

“What—what is this?” I continued, getting annoyed, “I get it, I’m sorry. I meant to get back earlier but Mark got hurt walking back and we had to carry him and it slowed us down and my phone was dead. It’s okay, I’ll go later—”

“—Son, tell us who you are.”

“What? What do you mean?” I raised my palms in a shrug.

“Giles!” Dad shouted down the hall. “Giles!” He moved further down the hall, and started up the stairs, shouting all the way. Mum looked at me.

“Is he here?” she asked, her face was confused and angry.

“Who?” I asked, my own anger now filling out my voice.

“Giles. My son.”

“I’m right here.” I raised my arms out fully. “Mum what are you—”

“—He’s not here!” Dad shouted from above.

“Then who the hell are you?” Mum shouted, “How’d you get in here?”

“With my key, obviously.” I held it up sarcastically. “Can you all please stop this.”

Dad was in the room now, he loomed towards me. He was not an angry man. He had the same fire and same heart as anyone does, but he didn’t exercise it. So when he did get mad he let it out in a great burst, as someone who hasn’t run in years does when faced with a mile. He would start blearing out of the gate, and end it limping and wheezing. But for that short sprint he could run as well as anyone, and now as he strode towards me, I prepared for it.

“Son, who the fuck do you think you are breaking in here, eating our food,” he was coming ever closer, “How’d you get in here, huh? Where’d you steal the key—”

“—Dad.” 

He grabbed me by my jacket, pulling me out of the seat. He was small, but I was smaller. He pushed me against the bench. Mum and Warren came closer as Dad pinned me. I looked from him, to Mum, whose eyes were watery and far away. She never liked fighting. She’d get him to do the talking whilst she slunk off to some room to cover her ears. Fighting in our house was a calm and orderly matter, done with utmost efficiency. But this time it was bad. Dad leaned close. “Where the hell is Giles?! What’d you do…where the fuck is my son?!”

“Dad, it’s me. I’m Giles, I’m right here!”

His eyes went wide at that and he pushed me away. I stood alone in the middle of the room, encircled by them. 

“Guys what the hell is going on!?” Tears were starting.

“He thinks he’s our son,” Mum said.

“I heard. Stay right there boy. Honey, call the police.”

“Dad, what are you doing, what happened?” I reached to grab the phone from Mum. As I moved he came lunging for me. I darted back. He kept coming.

“Dad stop—”

“—I said don’t move. Stay there. We will sort this out. You’re obviously confused and not yourself—”

I don’t know what that stirred in me, perhaps it was the three of them around me, or Dad’s deflating hands now trying to comfort me like trapped livestock, or the half-finished breakfast still on the bench behind him, but I felt I had to run. Right then was the only chance of escape, the small gap between Warren and Mum was where I had to go. I turned, and before the first number could be dialled I was out the door and out the gate and into the wide street. I ran and ran and ran. Leaves kept falling around me, my feet thundered along the pavement and all I could think was how Warren hadn’t even looked at me.",1,1753849907.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1mcx8xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mcx8xp/i_propose_to_you_a_party_idea_meal_prep_party/,I propose to you a party idea: MEAL PREP PARTY,"I’m on mobile so formatting sucks. Also English is not my native language.

I have never been the type to do parties but meal prep party is awesome.

We are a small family with a 9mo and 3.5 yr girl. And no family near by to help for extended period of time. We very rarely eat out so the key thing for us is meal prep. However, we have two working parents and even though my schedule is more flexible than most, we struggle to squeeze out time for meal prep. And that is where is all started.

I tried this with two families and it both went great and we are going to do that again.

With the first family, they have a sham and a working dad. Their two kids are 2mo and 3 yr. We have been doing playdates for the last two years on weekly basis so the older kids are fairly comfortable with both parents. We narrowed down the recipe: wontons. They are easier to make than dumplings shape wise and freeze really well raw. To serve, just get some soup and boil in water 5-10 mins. Also the stuffing has pork and cabbage in there so protein, veggies and carbs are all present. When they got to our house, the dad took the kids and us moms got to working while we chitchat throughout the process. They brought over the ground meat and I prepped the cabbage and bought the wonton wrappers. Normally, it would take me 2 hrs to prep, make 4-5meal worth and cleanup. Well with two working hands, we got triple the amount in 1.5 hr and both enjoy the adult socialization. The dads took the kids in the playroom and later out to the park. We all had fun and ended up with way more food than we thought.

With the second family, the mom, dad and their 10yr old daughter came. This time, we did curry saucy and fried chicken. Again, the dad took the baby, and their 10 yr old was playing with my 3 yr old. Us moms just work away in our kitchen. Just like last time, what normally would take me 3hrs to do everything and clean up, it took less than 2 hrs for triple the result. Both family and up with 3 meal worth of food and had a lot of fun doing it.

If you want to try it, here is what I recommend

1. Narrow down a recipe that freeze well, easy to heat up and everyone eats. At least 1 person needs to be very comfortable with the recipe and ideally the recipe is not complicated.

2. Split the ingredients so that both (all) participating family pitches in. 

3. Plan ahead for containers to take the food. I have a vacuum sealer and it works great with wontons. But for curry, I had the other family bring over their containers

4. Divide and conquer. My husband is not as good in the kitchen as me so he stays on child duty. However it is significantly easier to deal with 4 kids between two adults than 1 adult with 2 kids.

5. Plan ahead on space. The nice thing about this is you will only dirty 1 kitchen. And thus only need to clean 1 kitchen. So it  would be best to plan ahead on who is going to be at which station. For example, when we were frying chicken, I will need to bread everything then start frying. However, with another pair of hands, I only do the breading and the other mom did all the frying so it went by a lot quicker.

6. Enjoy your time! I do not trying this with people you just meet since it does require some level of understanding that other will use your kitchen or vise versa. However, cooking is also a great time for bounding and socializing considering the most of the time you can talk with other adults about any topics when your hands are busy.

There you have it. My ultimate guide to Meal Prep Party. I honestly wish I have done this sooner. Things gets done so much faster and easier.

Next time your mom friends want to hangout but you are tired of the same park/ coffee shop you have been going to, maybe consider having a meal prep party instead!",2,1753849878.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the sink drains reviewed offer varied features designed to enhance both functionality and durability.

**Material Composition and Durability**

The primary material used in sink drain construction significantly impacts its longevity and resistance to corrosion. High-quality sink drains frequently enough feature stainless steel or brass components, known for their robustness and resistance to rust.

Advanced designs feature a finer mesh or basket with smaller perforations to capture even small debris. The stopper mechanism, whether it’s a traditional push-pull or a more modern pop-up design, should provide a reliable seal to prevent water leakage while being easy to operate and maintain.

**Drainpipe Configuration and Installation Compatibility**

The drainpipe configuration, including size and threading, must be compatible with the existing plumbing in your sink setup. Standard sizes include 1 1/4 inch and 1 1/2 inch, but variations may exist depending on the sink model and regional standards. Ease of installation is also a critical factor, with features like pre-assembled components, clear instructions, and adjustable elements contributing to a smoother installation process.

**Odor Prevention and Water Tightness**

A well-designed sink drain should incorporate mechanisms to prevent sewer gases from entering the home, and to prevent water leakage. This often involves the use of rubber gaskets, tight seals, and P-trap configurations that trap water to act as a barrier against odors. Quality engineering ensures that all connections are secure and leak-proof,preventing water damage to the surrounding cabinetry and flooring.

Key features of the top-rated sink drains include:

# Lelit Glenda Gasket Replacement: 2025 best DIY Guide

The Lelit Glenda is a popular espresso machine known for its reliability and ability too produce cafe-quality coffee at home. though, like all espresso machines, certain parts are subject to wear and tear. The group head gasket, a crucial component responsible for sealing the portafilter to the group head, is one of the most frequently replaced parts on the Lelit Glenda.This gasket ensures that pressure is maintained during the brewing process, preventing leaks and allowing for proper extraction. A worn or damaged gasket can lead to poor espresso quality, inconsistent shots, and potential damage to the machine itself. this guide provides a thorough overview of the Lelit Glenda gasket replacement for 2025, offering clear steps and insights to help you perform this essential maintenance task yourself.

## Key Features Analysis

The Lelit glenda gasket replacement process is relatively straightforward,but understanding the key aspects of the gasket and the required tools is crucial for a successful DIY repair.

**High-Quality Silicone Construction:** The standard Lelit Glenda gasket is typically made from food-grade silicone.

The use of silicone ensures heat resistance and flexibility, allowing the gasket to maintain a tight seal even at high temperatures. High-quality silicone is also resistant to degradation from coffee oils and cleaning solutions, extending the lifespan of the gasket. Over time, the silicone will harden so it is indeed essential to keep an eye on its health.

**Precise Dimensions for Optimal Seal:** the Lelit Glenda gasket has specific dimensions designed to create a tight and leak-proof seal between the group head and the portafilter.These dimensions typically include an inner diameter, outer diameter, and thickness that are precisely engineered to match the Lelit Glenda's group head. Using a gasket with incorrect dimensions can lead to leaks, inconsistent espresso extraction, and even damage to the machine.Measurements can vary ever so slightly, so comparing it visually with the old gasket is essential.**Food-Safe and BPA-Free Material:** Gaskets intended for espresso machines must be made from food-safe materials, such as food-grade silicone, to prevent contamination of the espresso.

ensuring the gasket is BPA-free further protects the health of the user by preventing the leaching of harmful chemicals into the coffee. Always confirm that the replacement gasket meets food safety standards before installation.

**Easy Installation design:** A well-designed gasket should be relatively easy to install and remove, typically without requiring specialized tools.The Lelit Glenda gasket usually features a slightly flexible design that allows it to be easily inserted into the group head.Proper sizing and material properties contribute to a snug fit that ensures a reliable seal.Key features of the Lelit Glenda gasket include:

   Heat resistance up to typical espresso brewing temperatures
   Resistance to coffee oils and cleaning solutions
   Food-grade silicone construction
   Precise dimensions for a leak-proof seal

Replacing the Lelit Glenda gasket provides several key benefits, including improved espresso quality, prevention of machine damage, and cost savings.

**Improved Espresso Quality:** A new gasket ensures a tight seal between the portafilter and the group head, maintaining consistent pressure during extraction.

This consistent pressure is essential for creating high-quality espresso with optimal crema and flavor. A worn or damaged gasket can cause pressure loss, resulting in weak, watery espresso. replacing the gasket restores the machine's ability to produce rich, flavorful shots.

**Prevention of Machine Damage:** A leaking gasket can allow water to seep into othre parts of the machine, potentially causing corrosion or damage to electrical components.

Replacing the gasket promptly prevents water leaks and protects the machine from more serious damage.Consistent pressure is maintained throughout the machine.Regular gasket replacement can extend the lifespan of the Lelit Glenda and prevent costly repairs.

**Cost Savings:** Replacing the gasket yourself is a cost-effective way to maintain your Lelit Glenda.

Professional repair services can be expensive,especially if you need to ship the machine for servicing. Performing the gasket replacement yourself saves on labour costs and allows you to keep your machine in top condition.

**enhanced Machine Performance:** Replacing an old, hardened gasket enhances the overall performance of the espresso machine.

A fresh gasket provides the necessary flexibility and sealing ability to optimize the brewing process. This results in consistent shot times, proper extraction, and the ability to fine-tune your espresso recipes for the best possible flavor. A new gasket gets you ready for the next brewing session.

Letter 1,"It's been well over 2 years since I've had an insomnia episode, but here I am. Exhausted...mentally, but my body finds itself awake. Its been a long time since I've thought about you. Maybe, it's the familiarity of not being able to sleep on a clear summers night, while my brain remembers that summer where two strangers shared in each others existence. Even if it only was for a few months, even if it only left traces of a well formed friendship. 

Do you remember that one night, where I got your birthday wrong and snuck some extra cash to buy you my favorite poetry book? It wasn't your birthday, but for 6 hours in the middle of the night we pretended it was. You sat outside your hotel smoking in your car, I sat outside my prison, curled up in a camping chair. We kept hoping our phone batteries wouldn't drain too fast from Snapchat video calling. 

I was shy, worried that while I messed your birthday up, you would find my gift silly. Somehow, you talked me into reading my favorite poems to you. I didn't stutter, or argue. I would glance at you, with your eyes closed and a smirk on your face. You were disappearing with me into the words, getting lost in the corner coffee shop somewhere in Paris. 

I don't think I've reread that book since. It's weird, because you're gone from my life, stuck in that chapter of my book. I left you there, but yet I pick and choose very carefully what I give and take from you. I've taken the anime you showed me, turned it into a comfort show. The cursed Bee Man still lives on the back of that church offering envelope, tucked safely inside a bag of keepsakes, just incase one day we meet and we still want to share him as a friendship tattoo. I have a deep love for Corey Taylor, even saw him live...but only because you made me love Slipknot. I sing Beanie Season, when the leaves change and the air gets cooler. I still look at the moon, and leave the green gummy bears. Not just because I dont like them, but there's a comfort in knowing you'd take them. 

I've taken a sleeping pill, and decided to talk to you while it kicks in...that was 25 minutes ago. I can see the stars from my window, and I finally feel tired enough to sleep. I miss you old friend, and I hope those demons you battled so hard have finally silenced themselves, and you've found the type of safety and comfort you so selflessly gave out.

1mcx1zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1mcx1zu/help_lprsilent_reflux/,Help :( LPR/Silent reflux?,"

I was hoping to hear some success stories also some advice because I am struggling a lot with this. 
I suspect I have LPR, I haven’t been diagnosed yet but I do believe it’s either that or TMJ or both 🙃 
My main symptoms are which are ruining my life to put it bluntly are: 

- [ ] Globus sensation, feel like I have constant mucus in my throat also sometimes it varies to a scratchy prickly feeling in the upper left hand side of my throat or it can feel like pressure at the base of my throat or in the middle. 
- [ ] A very very tickly throat which makes me feel like I need to cough constantly. Even after coughing or forcing a cough it doesn’t relieve it but it gets so intense I feel like I don’t know what else to do except cough to minimise it even if it’s the slightest bit. But the tickle feeling in my throat is always there. It is a lot worse when socialising and talking or laughing/crying any emotion except being still basically. Which is very depressing because it is now affecting how I do these things which affects my quality of life. 
- [ ] Throat feels very sore after waking up 
- [ ] Back of my throat feels very sore after a weekend with friends talking and laughing 
- [ ] Again after talking or sometimes not at all it can just be there, I have so much tension in and around my jaw. I get bad headaches and what feels like a headache under my cheek bones, in my temples and under my tongue. Like where the saliva glands are. I also get a swollen tongue feeling which drives me nuts
- [ ] Chest tightness and shortness of breath as well as an itchy tickling feeling that radiates from my throat down into the middle of my chest
- [ ] Tired/hoarse voice - sometimes even when speaking to people if I don’t breathe super slowly and carefully or I don’t clear my throat or cough in between my sentences, my voice will cut out mid talking or I have to constantly stop to swallow my saliva. If I’m talking I just feel like my throat is closing up and I have to keep stopping to get air in or cough etc. oh and the tickling feeling in my throat feels so much worse after using my voice which then brings on the cough even more. 

This has been going on 18 months. I am beyond fed up. I am only 26 years old and want to live my life, I tried for a long time to ignore it and hope it would go away but it never did. Like I said before it is impacting my quality of life so bad I have fallen into such a deep depression over it. Especially after being knocked back by doctors and told that it’s nothing. Also, seeing people’s experiences in Facebook groups as well as reddit etc has discouraged me even more, the treatment for this or similar conditions seems pretty much non existent and like people suffer for life. I genuinely cannot go on like this for the rest of my life, I’ve never felt so isolated. I very rarely see success stories and I am praying it is because people just forget to post them and move on with their life once they sorted this..but I need some kind of hope and reassurance. 

Also to note, I have tried a lot of things and still am. 
I tried omezrapole 20mg for like 3-4 months but noticed no change. However I have heard that going on a higher dose helped some people, as well as the life style change. This is currently what I’m looking into, I am doing the Dr Koufmans diet (or trying my best to anyway) and I’m on 40mg of omezrapole and have been for the last 10 days or so, haven’t noticed much change yet though. I do worry because It’s not working because I’m not following it to a T but I am already struggling with how restrictive it is, I would say the only thing I haven’t changed out of my diet is my caramel latte coffees because I literally can’t survive without it and it’s like the one and only thing that brings me happiness lately - how depressing lol. But I only have one actual coffee in the morning then I have 2 decaf ones later because like I said it is the only thing that gets me through the day. I changed everything else that I eat and it all falls within the guidelines of what is in the diet. I also drink alkaline water each day and try sleeping on an incline. I usually find during the night I fall off the pillows but do try to readjust myself if I wake up. I don’t lay down after eating and I also don’t eat close to bed time, I’m waiting at minimum 2-3 hours. 
I have had an ultrasound done which was all clear.
I’ve had 2 ENT scopes which were all clear.
I’ve tried Valium, Prozac (antidepressant which I’m still on) allergy meds, propanalol, gaviscon after meals. 
I’ve tried doing remedial massages.
Did quite a few sessions with a chiropractor and an acupuncturist where they did dry needling and Chinese herbal medicine. 
I have tried medication, relaxation techniques as well lowering my anxiety as best I can. I don’t really have anything to be worried about lately except for this. 
I am at my wits end. I have quite a few things booked because I am determined to solve this and go back to my normal self. 
I have got more remedial massages booked (just to help with tension which will hopefully help this) 
Been to an Osteopath where I am visiting her regularly. 
I have a Barrium swallow booked, a consult with a GI and am visiting a new ENT 4 hours away from me next week - he specialises in vocal chord dysfunction so he might be able to help me or eliminate that area for me. 
I have a CT scan booked as well. 
Also have a TMJ dentist appointment booked to rule that out. 

I think the hardest thing for me is not even know what I have, or if I’m on the right track. I am constantly speculating with everyone’s different experiences and I can’t pinpoint where it would come from. I’ve obviously gone down a lot of path ways of what it could be but my main suspicion at the moment is LPR/reflux related except I have no other reflux symptoms other than what I listed above. 
I would just love to hear some friendly advice, words of encouragement or success stories :( ",1,1753849234.0,singing,1,1.0,False
1mcx1ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmyLynnBradley/comments/1mcx1ug/possible_theories/,Possible theories,"Here is my theory. I think a couple of things could have happened. First, I believe the witness account of the man on the beach and the fact that someone is visiting the site makes me think that maybe she is still out there. 

However, and couple of details such as the shoes still being out there and her personal belongings still in the room make me believe that if she did leave, someone must have lured her out. She probably would have put on her shoes, not sure how many pair she had but that's what I'd think. 

The balcony door was still open so I am not sure why she wouldn't close it behind her if she hadn't planned on coming back. 

Anyways, here are the theories: 

1. She was smoking on the balcony and was called over to the next room by the creepy guy next door that traveled alone. To me he knows more than what hes letting on. He seems like he holds guilt. Maybe hes trafficked her or Maybe he offered her something or asked for a cigarette. She planned on returning but he made an advance that she didn't like and he harmed her or killed her in some way, throwing her off of the balcony himself . Probably met with foul play. 

2. I don't think the family has anything to do with it, but her brother does seem like he holds some guilt. Maybe guilt that he wasn't there to help her or a stretch,  Perhaps while they went out to the club he got some drugs or got in trouble to some extent then someone came to the room looking for him or asking for money for the drugs and she stepped outside to talk to them (I think though that one of the family members would have heard the door open though). Then they took her and told her to get off the ship with them to settle the debt. 

3. She was overly intoxicated that morning and felt sick. She pushed the table against the balcony to puke and fell over. 

4. The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is why she would leave without her shoes and leave the balcony door open. How would she go to meet yellow? Maybe she went for a coffee quickly or had other shoes or went for some medicine to lay off the sickness, met him and he lured her up to the closed club and tried to make an advance but she refused and he got mad and held her until they docked. 

I hope she's found or at least answers for the family can be given soon. Maybe she's out there somewhere or maybe she left on her own. I just know it must be hard losing a loved one. ",1,1753849219.0,AmyLynnBradley,0,1.0,False

1mcx0ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1mcx0ff/a_pretty_heavy_cup_of_coffee/,A pretty heavy cup of coffee.,"It is around 11 in the morning. After fiddling on my work desk for an hour, I stepped out for my morning coffee. There’s a slow, perpetual tiredness I have been carrying on my back for the past couple of years. I don’t know where it comes from, but it is always there. I miss the days when I could just stay energized and excited about life. There isn’t much to look forward to, I think to myself. 

I took my small cup of filter coffee and began wandering through the lanes of Jayanagar in South Bangalore. It is an extremely well maintained and beautiful place with huge overarching trees, clean roads and humongous lavish bungalows owned by MLAs, IAS officers etc. I stopped to look at one of the houses that immediately caught my eye. In the middle of appreciating how stunning it is, I also feel myself choking up a bit. A faint realization creeps in, that whatever I do in my life, there’s a chance I will never be able to have a life like that. 

I slowly pull myself back to reality, a place that I don’t feel like coming to anymore. There’s murmurs in our office about layoffs in a couple of months. I need to apply for new jobs. Suddenly, I remember I need to talk to my mother. She has been suffering from Alzheimer’s and Dementia for the last couple of years. Even though she is happy to hear my voice, she can hardly speak in full sentences, often forgetting that I don’t live with her in Kolkata. As I put the phone down, I could feel my eyes tearing up again.

As I walk towards my office, I see a couple of students from a pre-university college jostling each other over who gets to drive the scooty. I fondly get flashbacks to my university days, late night drives through the campus for a chai sutta. More than the images, I remember a glowing warm hug of what happiness used to feel like. Back when I was ignorant, carefree and living life without a consideration of what was waiting for me on the other side of the door they called ‘adulthood’. 

As I near the office gate, the filtered sunlight scatters across the pavement like it’s trying to paint something beautiful over everything broken. I pause, just for a moment, and let it touch my face. The world around me continues, brisk and indifferent. The students speed off on their scooty, disappearing into a future they haven’t begun to doubt yet. Somewhere behind me, the trees of Jayanagar whisper in the wind like they’ve seen lifetimes come and go, like they know this ache is part of growing. But like the soft murmurs of the leaves remind me how I need to open up, but I prefer staying in the silence. But nestled in that silence is a photo. It’s of my mother and me, from years ago, before the forgetting began. We are laughing at something, neither of us looking at the camera. She looks like she knows me. Like she remembers. I stare at that photo longer than I should, like maybe if I look hard enough, she’ll come back.

I feel that tiredness again; the one I can't explain. But this time, it doesn't feel like a weight. It feels like a companion. One that has quietly walked beside me, step after step, year after year. It has seen me collapse on nights when everything was too much. It has sat with me without the harsh judgements of my father. It has watched dreams close their windows as I reached out too late.

But today, as I take the last sip of now-cold coffee, I don’t try to fight it. Instead, I whisper to myself, “It’s okay.” 

I begin looking forward to the end of the day, when I get back to my home and have my girlfriend and my dog equally excited to hug me at my door. For a few moments, all of the weight vanishes. In midst of all of this fog, there is a piece of sunshine I hold on to.

Before I take the final few steps back into the building, the glass doors reflect a version of me that is still standing; frayed at the edges, perhaps, but standing.

We opted for veg food both ways. Here’s the full meal list we got served -

1. Masala tea mix from chaayos (idk if it’s legit chaayos) - that is not tea, that is gutter water, there’s no flavour of tea whatsoever. I don’t expect it to taste brilliant, but I’m sure there are better tea mixes at that price point 

2. Lotte choco pie - orange version - which was the only decent thing I ate throughout 

3. Instant coffee mix - same case as Masala tea mix 

4. Lunch - (had this on the first day of the journey)
- chapati - dry and thin, which I expect when it’s machine made 
- beetroot dry curry/stir fry - which tasted okay, there was no spice or flavour to it, but edible as it wasn’t oily or had anything unpleasant going on about it
- rice - had surprise jeera visits in between
- gravy - liked it, had mix vegetables, had flavour, helped me consume the chapati 
- sambar - what in the world is this? It’s not sambar, it is thickened water with some turmeric to make it look like sambar. There is no taste, and it makes rice even more dry and non edible. 
- milma set curd - this curd has all my heart. It was yum! And saved me from my hunger. I wish they would supply this curd to where I stay!
- pickle and sanitiser 
- Amul butterscotch ice cream - it felt that they served it to compensate the taste of the meal XD

5. Dinner - (had this on the return journey)
- same chapati and beetroot stir fry 
- gravy - it was bland
- sambar - same thing as lunch, I think it’s a set recipe so that didn’t change 
- milma curd ♥️♥️♥️
- milma vanilla ice cream - it has my heart again 
- pickle and sanitiser 

Why do they bother serving us such bland food in the name of quality? I remember travelling in 3AC and 2AC and buying food from IRCTC kitchen and that food used to taste yum! Be it idli, dosa, biryani, etc. 

I want to understand what’s going on behind the scenes if any of you have any idea?

I know they would’ve given out tender to get the tea and coffee mixed. The rates on it says it costs 10rs. I’m sure there are better ones in the market, in the name of supplying to the govt., these companies are ripping us off I guess.  

Tl:dr - VB EXP food tasted bland and unedible. Couldn’t finish the food due to taste. Want to know why they’re doing it? Food used to taste good before in the train kitchen.

1mcwzcg,https://i.redd.it/6oq1r4qhtxff1.jpeg,My rant about Origin Jumpworks,"*clears throat* tonight’s rant will be presented as if I am “in universe” 

Origin needs to get its head out of its ass! I decided to pull the trigger on a 325a. My thoughts? It’s just ok. Origin needs to decide if it wants to make a combat ship? Or a coffee bar? 

There are things to like about the 325a. Hell dare I even say love? The speed. It’s quick in both nav and scm. Particularly in scm. Having that little extra push to close in on a target is great! Two size 3’s and one size 4. Also pretty great! It’s capacitors also not horrible. 

Then we get to the god damn coffee bar! What a waste of space. Think of what this ship could be capable of if it wasn’t trying to be a barista with a gun? Fine! Keep the bed, but everything else? Could have been used to improve its combat capabilities?! Origin says the 325a is the companies answer to a light fighter. That answer comes with a question? Cream or sugar? 

What we get Is a company that seems to be confused. A company that even when it comes to luxury, has failed to stand out from the pack time and time again. With the exception of the 400i and the M50. When’s the last time you heard anyone get excited about an Origin ship? 

I dare! I double dog dare, Origin to make a no thrills honest to god combat ship. If they truly are a superior ship manufacturer? Then it’s time for them to put their money where their mouth is! 

And put down the damn coffee!

1mcwx8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mcwx8i/aita_for_changing_parenting_plan_over_vacation/,AITA for changing parenting plan over vacation?,"Hi Reddit. I (33F) am a newly single mom to an almost 5 year old. My kid goes to their dads (28M) every other weekend. Back in 2023 my friend (35F) of almost 20 years got a job in the same department as my then boyfriend. Eventually she would join him and his coworkers on their weekly wing nights. I knew they were hanging out occasionally but nothing seemed to cross boundaries. She even offered to “keep him in line” when I would complain about things he’d done during our hang outs. Once we separate and I move out, it seems as though this friend is at my ex’s house every time I stop by. My ex has had many female friends as long as I’ve known him so I was still not thinking much of it. Fast forward to the day before my kids birthday party. I get a text out of the blue from my friend asking to meet for coffee. She chats like all is normal; I hadn’t invited her to the party as she had canceled two plans last minute recently. The day of my kids birthday I roll up with the cake to my ex’s place and my friend is there, prepping the house for the party. This should have been my biggest red flag but I tried to let go of how uncomfortable I was; I am not a confrontational person. Then my kid starts telling me things that give me the total ick; **** made muffins with me, did my hair, read me story before bedtime, went clothes shopping for me. So I reach out to my ex to have a conversation about how uncomfortable I feel with their relationship, that I do not want to see her during drop offs. My kid randomly tells me “**** doesn’t wear socks when she sleeps at dads and his snoring doesn’t even bother her!” Call me naive but this threw me for a loop. A month or so later I pull up to his house for drop off to see my so called friend outside vaping. So we have ANOTHER conversation about it, where I basically pour my soul out, crying, telling him how betrayed I feel. He hugs me, tells me he cares for me and will do whatever I need to keep our coparenting relationship the way it has been. Things are normal for awhile and the day before he is to leave on a two week vacation (with our kid) we spend hours together chatting and visiting with his family. I bring him everything he might need to pack for our kid. When I drop my kid off he and his sister are awkwardly standing at the door, blocking my view into the living room. I hear my kid speaking quietly but my ex SIL says she’s talking to herself. The next day, I get forwarded a blurry snapchat of palm trees that my “friend” posted to her story. She is on vacation playing stepmom to our daughter and I am shattered. I cried on and off for a few days, confused as to how two people I trusted would do this. On day four I contacted a lawyer who informed  me this was grounds to nullify our current parenting agreement. So I am; no more friendly chats, no more shared holidays… it breaks my heart but I think I need to protect myself. AITA?",1,1753848802.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I was hoping to hear some success stories also some advice because I am struggling a lot with this. 
I suspect I have LPR, I haven’t been diagnosed yet but I do believe it’s either that or TMJ or both 🙃 
My main symptoms are which are ruining my life to put it bluntly are: 

- [ ] Globus sensation, feel like I have constant mucus in my throat also sometimes it varies to a scratchy prickly feeling in the upper left hand side of my throat or it can feel like pressure at the base of my throat or in the middle. 
- [ ] A very very tickly throat which makes me feel like I need to cough constantly. Even after coughing or forcing a cough it doesn’t relieve it but it gets so intense I feel like I don’t know what else to do except cough to minimise it even if it’s the slightest bit. But the tickle feeling in my throat is always there. It is a lot worse when socialising and talking or laughing/crying any emotion except being still basically. Which is very depressing because it is now affecting how I do these things which affects my quality of life. 
- [ ] Throat feels very sore after waking up 
- [ ] Back of my throat feels very sore after a weekend with friends talking and laughing 
- [ ] Again after talking or sometimes not at all it can just be there, I have so much tension in and around my jaw. I get bad headaches and what feels like a headache under my cheek bones, in my temples and under my tongue. Like where the saliva glands are. I also get a swollen tongue feeling which drives me nuts
- [ ] Chest tightness and shortness of breath as well as an itchy tickling feeling that radiates from my throat down into the middle of my chest
- [ ] Tired/hoarse voice - sometimes even when speaking to people if I don’t breathe super slowly and carefully or I don’t clear my throat or cough in between my sentences, my voice will cut out mid talking or I have to constantly stop to swallow my saliva. If I’m talking I just feel like my throat is closing up and I have to keep stopping to get air in or cough etc. oh and the tickling feeling in my throat feels so much worse after using my voice which then brings on the cough even more. 

This has been going on 18 months. I am beyond fed up. I am only 26 years old and want to live my life, I tried for a long time to ignore it and hope it would go away but it never did. Like I said before it is impacting my quality of life so bad I have fallen into such a deep depression over it. Especially after being knocked back by doctors and told that it’s nothing. Also, seeing people’s experiences in Facebook groups as well as reddit etc has discouraged me even more, the treatment for this or similar conditions seems pretty much non existent and like people suffer for life. I genuinely cannot go on like this for the rest of my life, I’ve never felt so isolated. I very rarely see success stories and I am praying it is because people just forget to post them and move on with their life once they sorted this..but I need some kind of hope and reassurance. 

Also to note, I have tried a lot of things and still am. 
I tried omezrapole 20mg for like 3-4 months but noticed no change. However I have heard that going on a higher dose helped some people, as well as the life style change. This is currently what I’m looking into, I am doing the Dr Koufmans diet (or trying my best to anyway) and I’m on 40mg of omezrapole and have been for the last 10 days or so, haven’t noticed much change yet though. I do worry because It’s not working because I’m not following it to a T but I am already struggling with how restrictive it is, I would say the only thing I haven’t changed out of my diet is my caramel latte coffees because I literally can’t survive without it and it’s like the one and only thing that brings me happiness lately - how depressing lol. But I only have one actual coffee in the morning then I have 2 decaf ones later because like I said it is the only thing that gets me through the day. I changed everything else that I eat and it all falls within the guidelines of what is in the diet. I also drink alkaline water each day and try sleeping on an incline. I usually find during the night I fall off the pillows but do try to readjust myself if I wake up. I don’t lay down after eating and I also don’t eat close to bed time, I’m waiting at minimum 2-3 hours. 
I have had an ultrasound done which was all clear.
I’ve had 2 ENT scopes which were all clear.
I’ve tried Valium, Prozac (antidepressant which I’m still on) allergy meds, propanalol, gaviscon after meals. 
I’ve tried doing remedial massages.
Did quite a few sessions with a chiropractor and an acupuncturist where they did dry needling and Chinese herbal medicine. 
I have tried medication, relaxation techniques as well lowering my anxiety as best I can. I don’t really have anything to be worried about lately except for this. 
I am at my wits end. I have quite a few things booked because I am determined to solve this and go back to my normal self. 
I have got more remedial massages booked (just to help with tension which will hopefully help this) 
Been to an Osteopath where I am visiting her regularly. 
I have a Barrium swallow booked, a consult with a GI and am visiting a new ENT 4 hours away from me next week - he specialises in vocal chord dysfunction so he might be able to help me or eliminate that area for me. 
I have a CT scan booked as well. 
Also have a TMJ dentist appointment booked to rule that out. 

I think the hardest thing for me is not even know what I have, or if I’m on the right track. I am constantly speculating with everyone’s different experiences and I can’t pinpoint where it would come from. I’ve obviously gone down a lot of path ways of what it could be but my main suspicion at the moment is LPR/reflux related except I have no other reflux symptoms other than what I listed above.

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone very much 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps.

 I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is ages between 25 and 32 and please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy.

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. I love traveling by train and public transport and its very cheap in France the TGV train is the way to travel here 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. Again I would love to move out and live with a nice lady in the future. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work at the moment and enjoying living in France i have moved to this new country that I love very much only been here a few years I'm lucky to be in a position to take some time out 

Alot of jobs especially in England were too much stress and pressure I am not saying I won't be working in the future I do have some plans for things 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I am well proportioned for my height 

I have some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. I have a real man's body 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and fake hair extensions. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings. So I'm attracted to natural looking women I don't have any physical preferences on physical looks though

Your also someone that doesn't wear a bikini on the beach that is too revealing 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort

1mcwsa7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcwsa7,[Mahlkonig x64sd] Burr Alignment,"Based on all the concerns of poor alignment for these new grinders I decided to check mine. Based on what I found they look to be good to me, but this is also the only time I've ever done this, so I'm genuinely open to opinions here.

One things that I was a little surprised by was the amount of fines that were already building up inside of the grinder after using it only for only 4 days. I'm realistic to not expect a grinder to be spotless inside by any means, but this build up seems like a lot for such a short period, especially since it seems like it will just collect deeper into the body. Any thoughts or am I being overly anal?

Regarding the disassembly, this was actually very easy to do. I was extra cautious after hearing some people have stripped a screw already, but I just made sure to have a screwdriver with a head that fit fully into the slots. I did notice that replacing the screws for the upper burr carrier was a little tricky because they can get cross threaded and obviously become difficult to tighten. I figured out that if I spin the screw counter clockwise first until I feel the click of the thread openings passing each other and then at that point tightening that it worked every time.

In terms of my satisfaction with the grinder, I am slightly disappointed that the retention is not what was advertised without bellows, but maybe this is because it just needs more coffee to run through it. With the bellows, which are far quieter than doing so on my Eureka, I get <0.1g almost every single time.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone very much 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps.

 I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is ages between 25 and 32 and please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy.

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do.

Excuse me, I would like some coffee, please.

Duolingo said the correct answer was:

Excuse me, can I have some coffee, please?

Given that the original sentence had a period and not a question mark, I'm not sure how my answer is wrong (though I think Duo's answer is fine - ""Can I have \[x\] please?"" vs. ""I would like \[x\] please."" is a distinction without a difference). Also this was a select words exercise, not free form, so the fact that the words were available to create the ""wrong"" (not wrong) answer was doubly frustrating.

I read your post while Grace was napping in her swing, and I had to put my phone down for a moment because it hit so close to home. I'm Emily, mom to a 10-week-old daughter, and I want you to know that what you wrote about performing ""fine"" even to yourself? I felt that in my bones.

Two weeks ago, I was sitting in my kitchen at 2 AM, still in the same nursing tank I'd worn for three days, staring at my watercolor supplies gathering dust on the counter. I used to paint every evening after dinner - these little landscapes that made me feel like myself. Now those brushes feel like artifacts from someone else's life.

But here's what I've been learning (and I say learning, not learned, because I'm very much still figuring this out): sometimes acknowledging that we're not fine is the first step toward actually being okay. You're not selfish for missing who you were. You're human.

I started using the Binky app for these tiny 5-minute reflection sessions during Grace's morning nap. Not because I'm some zen mama now, but because sometimes I need those five minutes to remember that I still exist as a person, not just as a milk-producing, diaper-changing machine. I also joined a virtual new mom support group through my pediatrician's office - it's on Zoom twice a week, and honestly, just hearing other women say ""I haven't showered in three days"" has been weirdly healing.

My husband surprised me last Sunday by taking Grace for two hours so I could sit with my journal and a cup of chamomile tea. I barely wrote a paragraph, but I cried a lot, and somehow that felt like progress too. I'm slowly learning that ""getting back to myself"" doesn't mean returning to exactly who I was - it means discovering who I'm becoming.

Some days I manage to sketch for ten minutes while Grace does tummy time. Other days, reading two pages of a cozy mystery while she's on my chest feels like a victory. I've been using the Baby Tracker app not just for feeds and diapers, but to note one small thing I did for myself each day, even if it's just ""put on earrings"" or ""made tea in an actual mug instead of drinking cold coffee from yesterday's cup.""

That mom you saw who looked so natural? I bet she has moments too where she stares in mirrors and wonders where she went. The difference might just be that she was having a good moment when you saw her, just like you'll have yours.

We're all figuring out how to carry both versions of ourselves - who we were and who we're becoming. Some days that feels impossible, and other days it feels like maybe, just maybe, we're growing into something even better than we imagined.

I’m in a band with 4 of my friends. It started with me and another girl wanting to play music together, and then 3 of my other friends joined. I thought, “Oh yay! Playing music with all my favourite people!” Turns out it couldn’t have gotten any worse.

First rehearsal: Beforehand we agree on playing Back in Black by AC/DC. Super easy beginner band song, right? 2 of the girls showed up saying “We thought you said Back to Black by Amy Winehouse!!” (I said AC/DC about 100 times but whatevs). I said “Sure we can play that now instead.” They hadn’t bothered to learn that either!! The singer gives Back in Black a listen and then outright refuses to sing it. Whaddaflip.

It sort of went downhill from there. We decided on Coffee and TV by Blur instead, fairly simple song. Guitarist turns up having not learned her part at all, the singer turns up and says “I don’t really like this song.” I asked her, “Have you listened to it?” She said no. How do you know you don’t like a song that you haven’t listened to????

Whatever though! We moved on to Petals by Hole; super easy song on all instruments! We played it for about 2 months straight and still didn’t manage to play it through because people kept messing up and then stopping and telling everyone else to stop. We played Petals so much I can’t listen to it anymore without getting war flashbacks.

I got frustrated, and pointed out that we were getting absolutely nowhere. The response I was met with was, “We’ve covered enough songs by now, we should start writing.”

We have not played one song fully through yet.

This band has been in existence since Christmas. It is now almost August. Are we deadass. We possibly have the worst chemistry for a band EVER, a guitarist who refuses to bring her electric guitar with her, a singer who doesn’t even listen to the songs before rehearsals and only ever wants to do songs completely centred around the vocals, and the worst part is that no one can take any criticism.

Being in a band with your best mates, you don’t want to hurt their feelings, so you don’t want to outright kick people out. Yesterday I got a bit annoyed with the singer over text and told her that she never learned any of her parts (in a more gentle way) and she got very very defensive (she sent a massive paragraph of “I HATE my name” over and over again). Then she and the bassist stayed online, but went to another chat to presumably talk about me. I cannot do this anymore. I don’t want to hurt their feelings but the game is gone I fear.

Here’s the part I need advice on. Two of the girls (the drummer and bassist) are AMAZING. They buckle down and work away, they always come with parts learned, and they always bring all their equipment. I would love to continue making music with them, but the other two are like torture to work with. I cannot do it. Sometimes I feel like they joined just to be included.

How do I go about this situation? I’m meeting up with them this afternoon. One thing that’s for sure is that I don’t want to play with this specific group anymore, but being such good friends with them all I don’t want any hurt feelings. Should I just say fuck em and quit outright or is there a gentler way to break it to them?",3,1753848186.0,bandmembers,5,1.0,False

**Am I wrong for questioning my whole relationship after I found out my (27F) bf (30M) was pocketing my rent money?**

**Originally posted to r/TwoHotTakes & r/relationship_advice**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Financial exploitation!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/IJMxaCmwUF)  **Apr 4, 2025**

We've been together five years. We live on a property my boyfriend's dad is renting. His mom and dad live in one house on the property and we live on the other. When we moved in, he told us the rent was $1600 for the house, so $800 each for my bf and I. A steal, I know! However, I just found out that my bf and his dad came to an agreement at the start of the lease last spring that he (his dad) would pay our rent in full and that the money I pay my bf for rent (to, I had presumed, pass along to his dad for rent) my bf could keep. 

He said they wanted to help him out by paying his rent and his car while he lived here with them, so this was how they thought to do it. I immediately felt betrayed for not being involved in knowing about this, but I also felt like it's a bit unethical because I wasn’t aware of where my rent money was going. 

I had been suspicious for a while, but I finally had the courage to ask. He admitted it and my stomach sank. His first reaction was to be mad at me for being upset about it. His POV is that they didn't tell me because it's not my business since I'm paying rent regardless. Therefore, if his dad wants to give him $800 a month for his car and also pay his rent to help him, this is a less round about way of doing it. He just keeps the $800 I'm sending for rent. He said in essence, it isn't my money (since it's rent money), so I shouldn't care where it ends up. He also said his dad asked him to keep it between him and his parents, so he was put in a weird position. 

I can see how this logically makes sense, but I can't help but feel like I've been paying him $800 a month to keep without my knowledge. I'm not upset ab his parents helping him, that is between them, and I don't want to have my rent covered either. I'm grateful for the cheap rent and believe I should be paying rent.

It's just the dishonesty and the fact that he just transferred my rent money into his bank account without telling me for a year that feels so wrong to me. We split everything else equally like groceries, utilities, and internet, except the occasional date night where he pays. I'm close with his family and frequently have them over for dinner, so it hurts that they all knew something I didn't. 

I have a full time job and a side job. My bf is self employed but doesn't make too much from that. I don’t typically mind, but I would like us to be more open with each other about finances. 

I don't know how to move forward from this even though I want to be understanding and kind to him because he says it’s a nuanced situation and that I should know he isn’t the type of person to steal from me. He’s apologized for the dishonesty but still doesn’t see the issue. The relationship hasn't been perfect, but it has been worth staying in for five years. I just don't know how to get rid of this gut feeling that this situation doesn't sit right with me. Plus, rent was due yesterday and I haven’t paid him yet. Is this grounds for a break up or can we work through it? If so, how? Or is it truly none of my business? Any advice is so appreciated!

>I am confused. BF’s dad is renting a property that has two houses but is paying rent for each of the houses separately or subletting one? You sure BF’s dad doesn’t just own the entire property? I would bet BF’s dad doesn’t expect any rent for the house and BF just told that story to get money from OP.

**OOP**

>>No, it’s like a big property with two small houses & their business is on it. He rents the entire plot of land, he doesn’t own it. Each house used to have its own rent along with the business spot but now he just rents all three in one big lease.

**RunJumpSleep**

>>>So there is technically there is no $1,600 in rent to pay if if he rents the entire property. It’s just you paying $800 to your boyfriend. Dad isn’t actually putting out any extra money for rent. He would be paying the same amount even if you and the boyfriend weren’t there since he rents the entire property. You are being scammed.

>Before you knew this, would you have described your relationship as having no real secrets? Has it changed how you view him or your relationship on a whole?

>Consider, if you were in a different rental agreement, and his parents were helping him financially without being involved in the rental agreement? He doesn't tell you. Do you feel the same way? 

>Do you feel like your relationship should be passed the not sharing important information stage? Do you feel betrayed? Does his remorse match your feelings?

**OOP**

>>These are good questions. I would say there were no real secrets before, but this has changed how I view the relationship as a whole (with him and the one I had with his parents too). After five years, I really felt like family, not a stranger. I don’t think I’d feel the same way if my rent money wasn’t involved at all. I do feel our relationship is past the stage of not sharing financial info. We’ve discussed marriage. I do feel betrayed. His remorse doesn’t match my feelings. He’s trying to dust it under the rug and move on from it because he doesn’t see it as a big deal.


[My (30M) bf says I (27F) prioritize work too much, but he’s basically unemployed. Is this just a difference in values or a dealbreaker?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/xPNKX5eAOQ)  **May 23, 2025 (6 weeks later)**

I’ve been with my bf for 6 years now. He’s a content creator and posts 2-3 times a year when certain products are released. I have a 9-5 job that is in my passion. I work from home, about 35 hours a week (40 on a hard week), and I have a side job related to my full time job that takes about 10-15 hours a month. I love my job, although it can be stressful at times, but it’s ultimately what I want to be doing. And I really don’t think I overwork or prioritize it more than other things. 

I’ve always been super open about finances, but my bf has not, which I respected and didn’t push after some unpleasant conversations about finances. I thought as long as he had it together, I was okay with it. I recently found out that he is getting help from his parents on rent and his car payment (so, I’m the only one paying rent essentially), and he hasn’t made a livable wage from his content creation since around Covid, which is why he needs the help. When he isn’t making content, (which he makes content about 3 weeks out of the year), he’s doing whatever he wants all day long. We’ve been living together for 2 years now, and it’s frustrating that he hasn’t tried to find another source of income and is okay just taking help from his parents. He’s not a 9-5 type of person, and that’s okay, but I would like him to do something. 

We were arguing recently over the financial situation, and he told me that my job is taking away from my ability to be 100% present in our relationship and that it doesn’t benefit him at all. He thinks the time I spend working and then the carryover after work, whether it’s stress or tiredness, is affecting us negatively. He also said he doesn’t benefit from me having this job. I disagree since I’m the only one actually affording rent and our split household costs like groceries. He also said that if my focus was 100% on our household, then our house (between both of us) would be spotless. I’ll admit I’m messier, occasionally leaving my coffee mug and breakfast dishes in the sink until after work, or not getting a chance to clean the litter box during my work day. I also have ADHD so will let laundry pile up and my office get cluttered, but I’m working on it and always make sure our common area is tidy. I think this is normal, but he sees it as a lack of investment on my part. (For the record, no he doesn’t do more of the housework than me other than vacuuming the house 1-2 times a day. But dishes, bathrooms, everything else we split. I do most of the cooking, too.) 

He basically told me that he doesn’t regret not having had a job for the past two years because we were able to spend a lot of time together and that I’m ungrateful for not seeing the things he does for me like make me the occasional breakfast or coffee during work. I am grateful for these moments, but in my opinion, now is when we should be working to build a life together, which involves financial contribution from both parties. I honestly would have preferred less time together the past two years if it meant we could talk about marriage, buying a house, having kids in a realistic way now. Given that I’m supporting myself on about $60k a year and he isn’t contributing anything else scares me. 

He said he never wants to be the person that work takes them away from their family or who prioritizes work over their family. He’s raised the concern that if we had kids, I’d be distracted by my job. I had working parents growing up and it just makes sense to me that I’d be able to have both without being villainized. His belittlement of my job is hurtful because he knows it’s my dream job and a super competitive field, so I care about it, but I also do prioritize our home the rest of the time. I feel like he doesn’t understand since he’s never had a “normal” job. He’s been working on creating an app that he says can bring us a lot of money in the future, and he’s upset that I’m not being super supportive of it. Honestly, I am supportive and am happy he’s so invested in this project, but I wanted him to find a steadier source of income first. Is this just a difference in values that we can work through or does it sound like a dealbreaker? 

Edit to add: I forgot an important detail! he said he had to work on his mental health for the past few years, which is why he didn’t seek a job sooner as well! This made me feel bad because I am empathetic to his mental health struggles, but he never shared this with me, so from my pov it looks like a lack of care or effort. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/Z3C9nJMM0z)  **July 23, 2025 (2 months after last post)**

I’m moving out!!! I got approved for an apartment this weekend and am excited to have the space to gain my own perspective and clarity. We’re staying together for now and will see how it goes when I move out. I think he’s seeing it as an opportunity for me to regret moving out and come back to him, but I want it to be an opportunity for him to get his life together and build a life with me. I’m aware it’s unlikely things work out how I’m hoping, but I think whether we break up or stay together moving out is my best next step. Thank you to everyone who gave advice and validated how I was feeling! It’s a weird situation and after a lot of therapy and thinking, I’m okay with the fact that I don’t have to keeping playing a game with rules I don’t understand. 

Edit to add that we’d only lived in the house for about a year when I found out about the rent. (We haven’t lived here together the whole 5 years of the relationship)

1mcwljw,https://v.redd.it/g7kuqb2fpxff1,Chasing V60 Quality with Gevi BrewOne by using Kenya Beans,"I’m a pourover fiend—gotta have my daily brew—but the V60 routine, while super satisfying and joyful, chews up my mornings. Setting up the kettle, scale, grinder, and filter is a ritual I love, but it’s rough when I’m slammed. So, I’ve been tweaking the Gevi BrewOne auto pourover machine, hoping to match the quality of my usual V60 brews.

And I’m using some Kenya Nyeri Thunguri SL28/SL34/Batian Natural beans for this. I’ve got it set to 0.55 oz (15.6g) coffee, ground medium-fine on my Gevi BrewOne built-in grinder, with a 1:18 ratio (280g water) at 205°F (96°C). My three-stage brew is: 45ml bloom for 45-50s, 160ml second pour, then 75ml final pour. if you want it sweeter and more acidic, just pour a little in the final stage and skip the rest. The last stage of a three-stage pourover usually extracts bitter compounds. Tbh, the Gevi’s bloom looks wetter than my V60 with the same 45ml, like in videos. I’m not sure why—could it be that the angle of Gevi’s filter is too narrow? I’m planning to tweak the water amount next time or change a filter, maybe cutting back a bit during the bloom stage to see if it helps. And I have been doing quick digging before brewing with a spoon like James.

Though the bloom looks a bit too wet, the pourover coffee’s pretty solid overall. These beans come out sweeter, with some cherry-like flavors.",3,1753847800.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1mcwl00,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mcwl00/im_36f_confused_about_my_7_year_relationship_with/,I’m ‘36F’ confused about my 7 year relationship with my bf ‘34M’. Am I being dramatic?,"Like the title says I’m confused. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 7 years. 

- We met on Tinder.
- He stayed one night and never left.
- 2 months into dating I catch him on a WhatsApp local hook up group. He cries says he won’t do it again and I stay with him.
- Fast forward 5 years and I find IG messages on an old phone from the prior year and find out he’s sent money to two women that I could find. He plays it off and I “let it go”.
- Last year he starts to frequent a bar. I mean everyday for “coffee”. Then one time I see a bartender with a toy that was his. He says he gave it to one of the guys up there and not sure how she got it. Then I find out he had the phone number of the manager. Then this last December I confront and ask him if he is attracted to someone who works there. He says he is but she has a bf and I shouldn’t worry. All the while he’s still going to the bar very regularly. As in every day for a few hours. He keeps this from me until I have to ask him point blank. 
- The frequent bar trips and giving money to the girls is eating at me. 
- By this time we have been living together for over six years  and we were living in a house he purchased. I drive a car he purchased for me. He is loving, caring, and sweet. 
- Finally in late January 2025 I confront him about my concerns and find out he was talking to one of the girls from IG (previously mentioned) for a week but, it fizzled out. I also can’t stand him going to the bar all the time. I tell him I don’t want to give up. But he basically just says nothing at all. And I leave. I packed a suit case and started moving my stuff out the next day. We started sleeping together a week later.
- There were a lot of ups and downs during the break up. It lasted 3 weeks. I actively focused myself and made it a point to keep my space and distance from him. He would reach out and I would go back to him and we’d hook up. But I ended up still fully moving out and have my own place now.
- During the break up a friend of mine tells me that he’s on tinder and liked her friend’s profile. I’m obvi upset but not totally surprised. I mean he’s single technically. And I thought about doing the same thing but just couldn’t bring myself to do it.
- Once, I hear that I don’t reach out to him but he of course does. So, instead of ghosting him I met up with him to tell him I think it would be best to cut off all contact and try to move forward. 
- He then breaks down and to sum it up he asks to get back together.
- I told him if we did then I didn’t  him to visit that bar anymore. He begrudgingly agreed. And has kept that promise to date.
- However, now he just goes to different bars. Not as often but, more than I would like. When he doesn’t go to bars he drinks at home everyday.
- I’ve asked him what his expectations are of me and what he wants out of this relationship. He deflects and asks me what I want and he tells me that he wants what I want. And he loves me. I ask him about marriage because fuck, we’ve been together 7 years. He says yeah we could get married. But he makes no effort to do the things he says he wants to do. 
- He works hard and when we’re together he’s so attentive, supportive,  and loving. I don’t doubt in my mind for a second that he doesn’t. My family loves him and I know he loves them. But does he really care about me? Does he really want to be with me forever? Also, why does he need to frequent bars all the time? I have also not been very “strict” he does whatever he wants and follows the one request I made to not visit that particular bar. 
- He has made a lot of effort to be better but, then there are those one off nights where he’s out and he just isn’t the person I love. He works out of town a lot and sometimes we’re more long distance than we are together.  I fucking love him so much but, I’m lost. Also, if he isn’t it then who tf is? He fooled me for a very long time and I just don’t know if I can trust anyone after this. So, I gaslight myself into thinking you might as well go with the devil you know. Through the seven years he’s done so much more good than bad in our lives. And I try to focus on that but, also question myself everyday. 

tldr long term bf has emotionally cheated and says he wants to get married but, makes no effort to move into the next stage. He frequents bars and I can’t stand it but, I also don’t want to be “controlling”. Am I allowed to ask him not to? Knowing it’s a non-negotiable for him though. I know he loves me but, I want him to commit. ",2,1753847753.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

- I’m productive in coffee shops, but only in spaces I like and where I feel productive — it depends on a lot of factors.

- I can’t work from an office because I can’t be surrounded by familiar people and hear conversations related to my work while working on the computer at the same time.

- I also don’t like — and it almost physically feels like I can’t — socialize at home where I live.

Sorry for a boring storing...

I go to a nearby pub for dinner once a week and sit at the bar. A few months ago she sat next to me and we struck up a conversation. One of the first questions she asked was if I was dating anyone. I shared that I had been early in the year, but wasn't anymore. She then asked if I was ready to date again. I asked her and she she and her wife had been separated for years. She mentioned briefly reconnecting with someone when they first separated, but it sounded like that had ended. Every time she came in while I was eating she would join me. At the start of the month, while we were talking she pressed her leg into mine and held it there. When I didn't move mine away we just looked into each others eyes and grinned. She asked for my number a bit later in the conversation. 

After that we texted a bunch over the week; there was a mix of (what I thought) were flirty texts as well as more serious conversations. She invited me to meet her for coffee on the weekend. A few days later, I invited her to go out for dinner. The next weekend she asked if I wanted to join her for dinner and when I said yes, said she would pick me up. By the end of the evening we were just looking into each other's eyes and smiling and not even talking. When we left she opened the car door for me.

I invited her to dinner the next time we were both free, and she asked if I wanted to hear some dating drama. I was a bit surprised and said somewhat uncertainly something like, ""I don't know, do I?"". She changed the subject and later that evening texted me ""I don't need that to be part of our friendship. But I do want to make sure there's no confusion or ambiguity we should clear up... it's hard to tell sometimes""

I just needed to get some feelings out. A while back I posted about this and it helped. It also gave me a place to vent without annoying my wife so I'm doing it again. 

I used to have a friend group we called the coffee club. When we worked together we would meet up all the time to chat and get fresh air. I left there almost 2 yrs ago now and because of the pandemic and me leaving things changed. 

First it was just not being around each other as much, like many people during that time. Then the 2 more affluent people stopped responding to my texts when i would make any sort of comment on social justice. It got worse with my new job because social justice is a significant part of this role. All of my time is dedicated to cleaning up other peoples messes and I couldn't talk about my job or passions with this role because those 2 would just shut down. 

There was a 3rd friend (Laura) that I was the closest to. Someone that I let into my life, and she let me into hers. Nothing romantic, we both have spouses and are committed to our families. That was probably one of the things that bonded us, we found someone that we could be open with, but not have to be concerned about anything else and our spouses were comfortable with our friendship. After I got tired of what was going on with Paul and Monica, I approached Laura and told her that i was pulling back from the larger group, but that I'd like us to remain close. She said she understood and we were good. Ffwd a year or so and she has stopped reaching out or responding, kind of like the others. That hurt. A lot. She was the one friend I had outside my marriage that was mine. Wife was not involved in that relationship and she wasn't jealous. I could relax in the safe space of Laura's company and not worry about the Mrs or her Mr or what ever. It was nice and now I felt alone and sad. 

Well last week i got a text. ""I miss you. Monica and I aren't doing well now. I think we needed you in the dynamic.""

Y'all. I felt sad for her. but at the same time, and probably more intensely, I was satisfied that they needed me. I felt validation that I was needed in that group to make it work. Paul was always fringe. Vital to the entire group, but I AFAIK he never spent time with the 2 ladies like i did. Even now, I think he is more interested in travel and other DINK lifestyle things than what the rest of us deal with. But to hear that I matter to the basic group dynamic, man that was really satisfying. 

I'm not proud of that feeling. I wish it didn't matter to me as much as it does. It feels childish and petty.

the steam is still rising, but that could mean anything.

Time is becoming this elastic thing, stretching and snapping back when I'm not looking.

I swear, I just sat down. The Light outside has shifted. Afternoon light. It was 5am when I sat down.

I know it was morning a few seconds ago because Sarah and I just had a long conversation.

Sarah also called yesterday to talk about my garden... or was it last week?

She said something about our groceries costing more this week and Pokémon cards being out of stock at the game shop again. Fuck.

I remember our conversation ending right as I noticed that the walls were breathing along with me.

During that moment I kind of felt like how I do right now.

Why does this feel like the beginning of an LSD trip?

The last time I took LSD was over a decade ago.

I had to stop because the people on TV started talking directly to me and giving me clues about how the apocalypse will take place in our current revision of Earth 42069's timeline.

After every trip, I would find notes in my handwriting that explained things like how to open portals and perform rituals.

Since getting sober, I sometimes catch my reflection moving before I do. Just for a split second- almost as if it is trying to escape the reflection and trying to become more real than I am.

I've had to stop looking directly at mirrors because of this.

The last time I stared at my reflection too long, it invited friends over with instruments and they started playing groovy music in my bathroom that made my balls sweat profusely as I danced the night away.

A woman in a white T-shirt and jeans walked out of the train station in Douburgh with a suitcase.   
  
Her delicate face turned slightly red as the sun hit her. She tucked wisps of curly hair behind her ears. Under her arched eyebrows were a pair of bright and pretty eyes, a slim nose, and Cherry lips. She looked so beautiful even though she had no make-up on.   
  
""Hello! You are Annabel Hewitt, right? I'm the driver sent by the Benton family.""  
  
Annabel nodded and followed the driver into the car casually. She was already worn out.   
  
On the way, the driver stole glances at the woman, whose eyes were closed as she rested in the back seat.   
  
This woman was Rupert Benton's fiancee.   
  
Rupert Benton was the most eligible bachelor in the city. At just twenty-one years old, he was already the CEO of Benton Group. He was way ahead of his peers. He was a vigorous, resourceful and no-nonsense person, causing many in the business world to be afraid of him.   
  
His grandfather, Bruce Benton, took it upon himself to find a wife for him. And he picked Annabel, a girl from the countryside.   
  
With his hands on the steering wheel, the driver took another look at Annabel's innocent face and clicked his tongue. He envisaged that she would have a hard time with the Benton family.   
  
At this time, Annabel slowly opened her eyes and looked at the strange city with a calm expression.   
  
The car arrived at the Benton family's residence soon. The driver carried Annabel's luggage for her.   
  
Annabel barely had one foot inside the house when a well-dressed woman appeared. She eyed Annabel from head to toe with a look of utter disdain.   
  
""Tracy!""  
  
""Yes, Mrs. Benton.""  
  
As soon as Tracy was given a signal, she began to spray the disinfectant all over Annabel.   
  
The well-dressed woman was Erica Benton, Rupert's mother. With her hands akimbo, she ordered, ""Her shoes and hair. Spray them, too.""  
  
Annabel's face and body were soon covered with droplets of disinfectant. The pungent smell made her nose a little itchy. She uttered coldly, ""What is wrong with you?""  
  
Erica flipped out immediately.   
  
""I heard that you're from the countryside, but I thought you would at least be well-behaved. It appears you are the same as the wayward and rude girls they breed over there. I'm doing this because I don't want you to bring any virus or bacteria into this household. Do you want us to get infected with whatever you are carrying?""  
  
Annabel is not a person who likes to listen to people's nonsense.. She would have walked out if she hadn't made a deal with her grandfather.   
  
""In that case, you should spray some disinfectant in your mouth because it stinks!""  
  
With this, Annabel shoved the servant aside and walked in.   
  
""You... Oh my..."" Erica pointed at Annabel with a trembling hand. Tracy hurriedly comforted her.   
  
In the living room, a girl who looked about the same age as Annabel was sitting on the sofa. She had on designer clothes and bright makeup. Her expression was more condescending than Erica's as she looked at Annabel. She was Rupert's cousin, Cathy Benton.   
  
""Are you Annabel Hewitt, Rupert's fiancee?"" Cathy rolled her eyes when she saw that Annabel wasn't dressed in designer clothes. ""Gosh, Grandpa has no taste. I can't believe he chose someone like you. Anyway, I heard you came here by train. You should have told us you are too poor to afford a plane ticket. We would have bought one for you. Wait, it seems there isn't an airport in the countryside.""  
  
Annabel looked at Cathy with one of her eyebrows raised.   
  
She wondered if every member of this family was so arrogant.   
  
There was indeed no airport where she came from, but her grandfather had booked an entire high-speed train to Douburgh just for her. These arrogant people had no idea that she traveled as luxuriously as someone who flew first class.   
  
Besides, she could have flown here in a private jet if she wanted.   
  
Annabel could easily make it clear to these people, but she didn't. She just went upstairs.   
  
Annoyance clouded Cathy's face once she saw Annabel ascending the stairs. She wasn't used to anyone ignoring her, so she followed her.   
  
""Where is my room?"" Annabel asked the maid behind.   
  
""Here!"" Cathy said, pointing at a door in the hallway before the maid could reply.   
  
She pushed the door open and added condescendingly, ""You have never stayed in a bedroom as big as this, have you? You should cherish it while living in here. I'm Rupert's cousin, Cathy. You should fawn over me if you...""  
  
Cathy had barely finished speaking when Annabel walked into the room and shut the door in her face. This made her angrier.   
  
""Ah! How dare that pauper be so conceited? What was Grandpa thinking?""  
  
The maid warily moved closer and asked, ""Miss, but isn't this Mr. Benton's room?""  
  
Cathy cast a scornful glance at the door.   
  
""Shush! Don't say a word to her. Rupert hates anyone being in his space or using his things. When he finds out that she's here, just tell him that she chose to stay in this room.""  
  
Cathy's eyes glistened with slyness as she spoke.   
  
  
  
Chapter 2  Night-long Cuddle  
  
Annabel didn't realize that this room belonged to someone else. When she saw that the bathroom was stocked with only men's products, she just assumed that the Bentons were trying to get on her nerves.   
  
""What an incredible family!"" she muttered sarcastically, walking under the shower.   
  
She only had to put up with this for three months. She had struck a bet with her grandfather. If she still had no feelings for Rupert after staying here for three months, their marriage would be called off.   
  
A maid brought in dinner for her once Annabel got out of the bathroom. She ate it and fell asleep almost immediately.   
  
It was already midnight when Rupert finally came back home from a business dinner.   
  
He was aware Annabel was arriving today. Bruce had told him to pick her up, but he refused under the guise of having many things to do at work. He had no interest in his fiancee. As far as he was concerned, the marriage would be canceled sooner or later.   
  
Rupert was fagged out. He managed to take a shower and went straight to bed.   
  
He was very drunk, so he didn't notice that someone else was in his room until he lay down on his bed.   
  
The large bulge under the quilt startled him. He moved away abruptly. The room was dimly lit, so he couldn't see the woman's face clearly. Before he could think straight, she rolled over and hugged him. She muttered, ""Teddy, don't be naughty. You should sleep now.""  
  
Rupert froze completely.   
  
This woman had a very familiar scent, just like that girl...   
  
It was soothing as his nose pressed against her neck. For some reason, Rupert found himself hugging her back. He fell asleep with Annabel in his arms.   
  
Strangely for an insomniac, Rupert didn't wake up at any point during the night. He slept like a well-fed baby.   
  
He had a dream that night. It was about what happened to him ten years ago. In a dark room, a girl embraced him tightly and said in a sweet voice, ""Don't be scared. No harm shall come to you. I'll protect you.""  
  
Later in the dream, he met that girl again. It felt so real.   
  
The next morning, Cathy woke up at the crack of dawn. She had been hoping to hear the news that Annabel was thrown out of the room once Rupert got back home. But the maid said nothing of such happened.   
  
Why was that? Didn't Rupert come back home last night? But his car was in the garage.   
  
Rupert hated anyone being in his space. He couldn't possibly have slept in the same bed as a strange woman.   
  
Consumed by curiosity and uncertainty, Cathy went to knock on Rupert's door. ""Hey, Rupert! Breakfast is ready. Don't you have a meeting this morning? You should get up now!""  
  
The noise woke up the two people who were fast asleep at the same time. Annabel immediately felt the warmth of someone else. Her head wasn't on a pillow but on a hard chest.   
  
She looked up, only to meet the sharp eyes of a man. She sat up immediately and was wide awake. ""Who are you?""  
  
Rupert's eyes darkened. ""Annabel Hewitt?""  
  
Since he knew her name, Annabel assumed that he was her fiance, Rupert. But why was he in her room?   
  
She was just about to question him again when he uttered, ""You came to my room and slept in my bed on your first day in this household. I must say that you are really something!""  
  
""What?"" Annabel looked completely confused. He just said this was his bed? How was that possible?   
  
Was every member of this family mad and troublesome?   
  
""Oh my!"" Annabel exclaimed as her mind went to the men's products she saw in the bathroom yesterday. It seemed Cathy had tricked her.   
  
In haste, Annabel got off the bed and looked at him coldly. ""Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sleep here. Cathy told me this was my room. No offense but I'm not in any way interested in you. come to think of it, I fell asleep alone. Why didn't you realize that someone else was in the bed when you got back? and why did you hold me in your arms for the whole night? Don't tell me you have a crush on me?""  
  
A look of embarrassment clouded Rupert's face when he heard her words. He couldn't deny that he held her in his arms for the whole night.   
  
Just like last night, he was stunned when he met Annabel's eyes.   
  
Her beautiful eyes were just like that girl's.   
  
Annabel squinted at him with a smile.   
  
""What? Why are you staring at me like that? Are you obsessed with me?""  
  
Rupert came to his senses. His face darkened again. He ordered coldly, ""Get out! And don't come into this room ever again!""  
  
Annabelle gritted her teeth.. She then left with her belongings without hesitation.   
  
This was their first meeting, but they already didn't like each other.   
  
Cathy, who was still at the door, was surprised to see Annabel come out.   
  
Annabel said with an ambiguous smile, ""Good morning! As you wish, your cousin held me in his arms and slept for the whole night. We got along pretty well. You must be happy about that.""  
  
""Nonsense!"" Cathy's face was livid. She didn't believe that at all.   
  
In her opinion, there was no way Rupert would like Annabel, let alone hold her in his arms for hours.   
  
But the fact that they had slept together for the whole night was plain to see.   
  
  
  
Chapter 3 New Secretary  
  
Annabel walked away with a fake smile.   
  
Cathy lost it. ""You bumpkin! Stop right there. I'm not done talking. Let me tell you, Rupert won't marry you!""  
  
Just then, Rupert walked out of the room.   
  
""Ermm... Rupert..."" Cathy stuttered, moving back in fear.   
  
Rupert's face darkened. It was obvious that he was angry, so Cathy didn't dare to say anything more.   
  
Annabel asked a maid to take her to her room. She unpacked her things and then went downstairs for breakfast.   
  
Erica, Cathy, and Rupert were already seated at the dining table.   
  
Erica began to criticize her as soon as Annabel sat down. ""Weren't you taught proper etiquette? Not only did you wake up so late, but you also didn't bother preparing breakfast. Do you think you're already the hostess here?""  
  
Taking a glance at Erica, Annabel said flatly, ""I'm not a servant either.""  
  
She would never make breakfast for this family.   
  
Although Rupert didn't say anything as the two argued, there was no denying that he didn't like Annabel either.   
  
The atmosphere in the dining room was tense. They ate in silence for most of the time. After breakfast, Erica held out a bank card to Annabel.   
  
""This card is loaded with about five thousand dollars. Buy yourself some decent clothes before going to the company. Remember to behave well. You mustn't cause any trouble for Rupert.""  
  
To develop the relationship between the two, Bruce proposed that Annabel work in the company as Rupert's secretary. Leonard Hewitt, Annabel's grandfather, agreed to the arrangement. She didn't refuse. After all, it was only temporary.   
  
Her new employment was no biggie for her, but the bank card was! It was obvious that Erica looked down on her. ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Annabel said in a sarcastic manner.   
  
There was nothing wrong with her clothes, as far as she was concerned. They were specially made for her. That was why the Bentons thought they were not designer clothes. Without waiting for Erica or anyone else to retort, she went upstairs to get ready for work.   
  
She had just gotten into her room when her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification. The sum of fifty million dollars had been transferred into her account.   
  
A text message from Leonard came through.   
  
""Dear, I hope they are treating you well over there. I transferred some money to your account. Buy whatever you want. And don't forget to inform me if anyone bullies you. I love you.""  
  
Annabel smiled and texted back, ""Grandpa, I'm not happy here. They are bullying me. It's not funny at all.""  
  
Leonard replied almost immediately, ""Glad to hear that. Anyway, I'm going fishing. Talk to you later.""  
  
Annabel couldn't believe her eyes.   
  
Sighing, she changed into a professional suit and walked out of the house. The driver opened the door for her. As soon as she got into the car, she found that Rupert was also inside.   
  
""Didn't you say that you had no interest in me? Why did you agree to work as my secretary then?"" His charming voice had a hint of irony in it. There was also a smirk at the corners of his lips.   
  
""Don't get any ridiculous ideas just because I agreed. I promised my grandpa to stay with you for three months. Once the timeline expires, we will cancel the marriage,"" Annabel responded, glancing at him indifferently.   
  
""Huh?"" Rupert sneered. ""Aren't you worried that you will fall in love with me in the next three months? I guess you'll be reluctant to leave then.""  
  
Annabel was amused by his words.   
  
""Funny you, Rupert. You clearly have a swollen head. For your information, I will never fall for you. Get down from your high horse.""  
  
Although Annabel knew that Rupert was good-looking, that didn't matter to her. He had the repulsive character that she hated in men.   
  
Rupert pulled a long face at her words.   
  
She would never fall for him?   
  
""We will see about that, Annabel. Don't ever forget what you said just now!""  
  
In Rupert's opinion, Annabel was just playing hard to get. Why did she come to his home if she didn't feel a thing for him or wanted to be his wife?   
  
Annabel smiled and said, ""Okay, I'll keep it in mind. Don't worry. In three months, we will go our separate ways. By the way, we have to pretend not to know each other at the company. I don't want unnecessary drama there.""  
  
Rupert kept in silent.   
  
Unbeknown to Annabel, she couldn't avoid drama at work. The news about Rupert's engagement had already spread like wildfire. People also knew that his fiancee was from the countryside.   
  
The employees in Benton Group were in a heated discussion.   
  
""Guys, have you heard the latest? Mr. Benton's fiancee will work here. She will be his secretary!""  
  
""Oh my! I heard she's ugly. And that she's from the countryside. Since she's poor, she must have attended a substandard college. Can she even understand the documents?""  
  
""Ha-ha! You can say that again. The way I see it, she won't be able to operate a computer.""  
  
The words of the gossipers trailed off as soon as Rupert walked in with Annabel. Everyone's jaw dropped when they saw them.   
  
  
  
Chapter 4  His Superwoman  
  
""Look! Who is that woman that came in with Mr. Benton? She's so beautiful and elegant!""  
  
""Wow! Her legs are so straight and thin! I have never seen anyone as beautiful as her!""  
  
""Is she Mr. Benton's fiancee?""  
  
""How is that possible? It can't be!""  
  
Many of the employees began to wonder who Annabel was. The most common guess was that she was a business partner. But when she left Rupert and went into the personnel department to sign in, they all realized who she was. The news spread in the company in no time.   
  
It turned out that the woman who came in with Rupert was Annabel.   
  
People didn't know what to believe anymore. Didn't they say that Annabel was an ugly bumpkin? How come she was drop-dead gorgeous?   
  
While Annabel was going over the necessary formalities, the employees in the secretarial department were gossiping about her.   
  
""Annabel is so beautiful! She's even prettier than Heather Norman!"" an employee commented.   
  
Nina Jones, the head of the department, had a frown on her face and disdain in her eyes. She said maliciously, ""Looks aren't everything. Beauty doesn't change the fact that she's a poor village girl who doesn't know anything about city life. She's not worthy enough to be Mr. Benton's wife.""  
  
Annabel had just walked into the secretarial department when she heard these words. A hint of irony flashed in her eyes. She retorted in a clear voice, ""If I'm not worthy enough to be his wife, who is? You?""  
  
Nina's face froze. She looked away and didn't dare to retort. She couldn't afford to offend Annabel.   
  
""Ahem! Mr. Benton earlier told me to treat you like every other person in this department. You will receive a fair amount of work despite your status. Here is the document about the advertisement the company is going to shoot today. It's yours to handle.""  
  
With a sneer, Annabel took the document and left.   
  
The others surrounded Nina again.   
  
""Nina, is it Marcel's shoot? Annabel is new. Don't you think she will screw it up?""  
  
A spark of mischief shone in Nina's eyes. The face of the advertisement was Marcel Brooks—a young and bad-tempered celebrity. He was hard to please and work with. People always avoided him. She looked forward to seeing Annabel mess things up on her first day.   
  
As soon as Annabel got out, she went through the document that outlined the process of the advertisement. She raised her eyebrows when she saw Marcel's name in there; it was familiar.   
  
In the CEO's office, Rupert's assistant asked him, ""Nina Jones handed over Marcel's shoot to Miss Hewitt just now. Should I order someone to replace her?""  
  
Marcel's elder brother was a friend of Rupert's since childhood. Everyone knew that Marcel had a bad temper. It went without saying that Annabel would suffer a lot at his hands if she worked with him today.   
  
Remembering what Annabel said to him this morning, Rupert finally replied, ""No, let her do it.""  
  
He would take delight in her suffering.   
  
The company was in charge of everything for the shoot. Annabel and some employees went downstairs to welcome Marcel.   
  
A few minutes passed before a black Bentley drove into Benton Group's premises. Marcel got out wearing a pair of sunglasses. At the age of nineteen, he already had millions of fans all over the world. His fame contributed to his arrogance. He held his head up high and walked like he owned the place.   
  
Annabel walked up to him and extended her hand for a handshake. ""Welcome, Mr. Brooks. I'm Annabel Hewett, the person in charge of the shoot. It's my pleasure to meet you.""  
  
Marcel didn't take her hand or exchange pleasantries. He just complained with a frown, ""It's so hot. Why didn't you bring an umbrella? Anyway, is everything all set? I don't have time to waste. By the way, buy me a cup of coffee before we begin anything. Don't get me a cheap one. I want one from that cafe downtown. They make the best...""  
  
Marcel's words trailed off when he finally looked at the woman's face. His jaw dropped.   
  
""Holy moly! Annabel! Am I dreaming?""  
  
Marcel took off his sunglasses and still looked incredulous.   
  
He hugged Annabel excitedly.   
  
""Annabel? Why are you here? You work here? When did that happen? Shouldn't you be traveling around the world now?""  
  
Annabel stroked Marcel's head and said with a smile, ""Marc, long time no see. What did you say you wanted to drink again?""  
  
""Nothing! I didn't say anything. What would you like to drink? I can get it for you.""  
  
Everyone present was dumbfounded, to say the least.   
  
The ever-so-arrogant Marcel not only hugged Annabel but was also speaking to her politely. He even allowed her to stroke his head.   
  
Was this really Marcel or some clone who was passing off as him?   
  
Could it be that he was so respectful because Annabel was Rupert's fiancee? But he was usually arrogant in Rupert's presence. What was going on?   
  
The truth was that Annabel and Marcel met two years ago.   
  
At that time, Marcel was seventeen. He was filming in the countryside, very close to Annabel's home.   
  
Some thugs kidnapped him. Fortunately, Annabel saved him by chance.   
  
Marcel had fearfully watched her beat up the kidnappers so easily. He had thought he was going to die in captivity, but she had come to his rescue like a superwoman.   
  
She had invited him to her home. Much to his surprise, her home was even bigger than the mansion in Downton Abbey.   
  
It turned out that she was not only kind but also well-to-do. He couldn't help but hold her in high esteem.   
  
  
  
Chapter 5  Chivalrous Lad  
  
The two walked into Benton Group. And the shooting went on smoothly.   
  
Some of the clothes weren't up to Marcel's taste. He complained about them. But when Annabel said that they were good, he immediately changed his opinion.   
  
He set aside his nitpicking attitude just because of her. Whenever he went out of line, Annabel's glance brought him to order.   
  
Marcel was intimidated by her. Asides from the fact that he respected her for saving his life, he feared that she would spank him if he annoyed her.   
  
It was estimated that the shoot would take five hours because of Marcel's attitude, but it took only two hours.   
  
Once it ended, Marcel pulled Annabel and said, ""Let's go. We have a lot of catching up to do. I'll treat you to dinner.""  
  
""No, I can't. I'm not off duty yet!"" Annabel refused him coldly.   
  
Some of the employees were still on the set. They pretended to be busy, but they gossiped about the two on the spot.   
  
""What? Marcel offered to buy Annabel dinner but she turned him down.""  
  
""Holy moly! What is she thinking? Doesn't she know who he is? Many girls would jump at the offer. How can she be so arrogant?""  
  
""I wish he could take me instead. I can quit my job just to spend some time with him. Oh, Annabel is so foolish.""  
  
Being rejected, Marcel wanted to cry. After thinking for a while, he asked, ""By the way, why did you start working here? Oh my! Did your family go bankrupt? If so, I can support you. You don't have to slave away here, okay?""  
  
Annabel rolled her eyes and said, ""You know nothing, Marc. Now if you will excuse me...""  
  
She then went back to work.   
  
Everyone who saw the scene thought Marcel would storm out in a fit of pique. To their greatest surprise, he smiled helplessly and went to the lounge to wait for Annabel until she got off work.   
  
By closing hour, Rupert walked out of his office and said to Annabel, ""Grandpa made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go have dinner there.""  
  
Rupert didn't want to, but Bruce threatened him. The man was hospitalized earlier after having a heart attack. On video call, he said, ""You must go. If you don't, I'll pull the plug on this ventilator. Do you want me to die?""  
  
Rupert's hands were tied, so he had to agree.   
  
Annabel was about to reply when Marcel came in.   
  
""Annabel, you are off duty now, right? Can we have dinner now?""  
  
It wasn't until Rupert coughed slightly that Marcel noticed his presence.   
  
""You are here, Rupert!"" he exclaimed.   
  
Did Annabel and Marcel know each other? Rupert looked at the two in confusion.   
  
Annabel, who had been silent, finally spoke. ""How about we all have dinner together?""  
  
In the end, the three of them went to the restaurant that Bruce reserved earlier.   
  
During the ride, Marcel kept talking to Annabel, who replied in a friendly way from time to time.   
  
When they arrived, Marcel became chivalrous. He opened the door for Annabel and even pulled a chair for her. He also put food on her plate and poured her a glass of red wine.   
  
Rupert was relegated to the background. It was as if these two were in their own world, and he was just there to watch them.   
  
""By the way, you still haven't told me why you decided to work in Benton Group. Is there something between you and Rupert?""  
  
Marcel suspected that they were involved with each other.   
  
Glancing at Rupert, Annabel answered, ""My grandpa asked me to work here. As for what is between us... We are engaged.""  
  
Marcel spat out a mouthful of water.   
  
""You both are what? What a small world we live in! So, you are the countrywoman whom Rupert got engaged to?""  
  
Annabel nodded casually.   
  
The rumor of the engagement was widespread in Douburgh, so Marcel knew about it. Since he knew about Annabel's background, he couldn't help but sigh because of how clueless the media was.   
  
She was indeed from the countryside, but she was far from being poor. The Hewitt family was super rich and had dozens of villas scattered around the world.   
  
""Are you two in love?"" Marcel looked at them in disbelief.   
  
""Don't get the wrong idea. We are not in love. The engagement will be canceled three months later,"" Annabel said calmly.   
  
Marcel breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. Without mincing words, he uttered, ""That's good. Rupert doesn't deserve you. I'm even better than him. You two are nothing alike. He's cold and boring. A marriage between the two of you would be a disaster.""  
  
Rupert knifed the steak on his plate and chewed hard as fury brewed inside him.   
  
He didn't deserve Annabel? What nonsense!   
  
""That reminds me, Marcel. Your brother asked me to buy the car you have always wanted. He plans to give it to you. I think...""  
  
""come on, Rupert. I didn't mean that. Can't you take a joke anymore?"" Marcel smiled awkwardly.   
  
They had a nice meal. After walking out of the restaurant, Annabel and Rupert bid Marcel farewell.   
  
""Bye, Annabel! I'll visit you whenever I'm free.""  
  
Annabel stroked his head again as they hugged. She waved at him. ""Bye, Marc. Take care!""  
  
She petted him as if he were Teddy, her Alaskan Malamute.   
  
He grunted and got into the car. On the way back, he finally complained, ""I see why you boldly said that you'll never fall in love with me. You're in love with someone else.""

Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron. — 1 TIMOTHY 4:2
 
Keep a tender conscience — don’t violate it — because it is your conscience, the voice of your spirit, that relates to your mind what the spirit of God is saying to you down inside. If you don’t keep a tender conscience, spiritual things will not be clear to you.

During the mid-’30s, I pastored a country church and usually spent Sunday nights in the home of a dear old gentleman who was about eighty-nine years old. He and I didn’t get up as early as the rest of his family on this farm, so we had breakfast together about 8 o’clock. He’d have one of those old-fashioned coffee pots sitting on the woodstove with the coffee just boiling in it. I’ve seen him pour that boiling coffee into a mug, hold it up to his mouth, and drink the whole cup of boiling coffee in one gulp. The first time I saw him do it, I felt like I was burning all the way down!

How could he do that? I certainly couldn’t do it. My mouth and throat are so tender, one teaspoon of boiling coffee would have burned me. He couldn’t do it either, to begin with. But through the years, drinking boiling coffee had seared this man’s lips, mouth, and throat, until it was easy for him to drink the whole cup of boiling coffee in one gulp.

The same thing can happen spiritually. Keep a tender conscience. Stop the minute you miss it and your conscience condemns you. Say, “Lord, forgive me. I missed it.” Or if you need to, tell someone you have wronged, “I did wrong. Please forgive me.”
 
Confession:
I keep my conscience tender.

I don't think I had much of an internal monologue when I was young - my automatic thought processes contained some words, but was mostly images, concepts, etc. I also had pretty bad speech disfluency though, and as my parents started encouraging me to stop and plan my sentences more, I developed a sort of running internal monologue? It still doesn't feel fully automatic, though, more compulsive. It's like a mandatory second layer that my automatic thought processes get filtered through, running alongside them on a slight delay. I still experience weird ""glitches"" in it though: 

- ""logjams,"" where the verbal train seems to ""take over"" the automatic one or distract it and I get stuck looping the same thought over and over, unable to generate anything new

- ""speaking in tongues"" where the monologue will just start generating an unending string of english-adjacent gibberish, usually in some distinctive voice that isn't mine, like Peter Capaldi, Sonic the Hedgehog, or the cast of a podcast I was listening to at the time. (This doesn't happen very often, but it's pretty memorable when it does.)

There's other things, but these are the big distinctive ones, and the ones I have the hardest time explaining to other people.

I also used to have major problems with my visual imagination ""derailing"" itself uncontrollably. (It's like the ""pink elephants"" problem, but a lot more frequent and random than I think is probably normal?) Objects in my imagination failing to move when I prompted them to, or moving in unexpected ways, rotating uncontrollably, defying the laws of physics. I remember, as a kid, being unable to imagine a character placing a teapot on a small table in a book i was reading, she kept placing it on the floor next to the table instead. I tried to mentally ""pick the teapot up"" and put it where it was meant to go, and instead it moved in a perfect arc and ended up on the floor on the other side of the table. I don't know how long I spent staring at that one page of the book, not reading it, just bouncing a teapot back and forth over a coffee table in my head like a really shitty blender animation. This problem has gotten a lot better over time, but mostly because I'm better at moving on quickly and continuing the thought despite the derail, not because I'm any better at wrangling the visuals themselves. It also prevents me from doing anything cool in a lucid dream.

Maybe this all just sounds like pointless navel-gazing, but I find this stuff really interesting and I'm super curious to what extent other people experience things like this. I've seen a lot of people online ask questions about the *absence* or *presence* of visual imagination or internal monologue, but a lot less about this sort of ""vivid but uncontrollable"" problem.

Outdoor seating, fresh air, and a nice coffee/tea. And for my money, Emeryville punches well above its weight when it comes to great cafe options.

- Arizmendi (San Pablo near Park ave., open Wed-Sun) is mostly known as a bakery/pizza place, but they do some great flavored lattes and offer one of my favorite cool Summer treats: the Laura Palmer, a mix of chai and lemonade. 

- Soul Blends (corner of Louise and 32nd; technically W. Oakland) is fairly new, and also doubles as a community space in the evenings. Their pastry options are more limited than Arizmendi, but they offer a much wider selection of coffee and teas. It's a very quiet block, and there are lots of friendly dogs around.

- Polaris Cafe (Horton across the street from Amtrak) is easy to overlook, as it's signage is small and there isn't a lot of foot traffic in the area, but they make excellent sandwiches and offer a full coffee and tea menu. Of the three mentioned so far, it's arguably the best lunch option assuming you aren't looking for pizza. 

- Doyle Street Cafe (Doyle near 55th) is really more of a brunch spot than a traditional cafe, but it's one of the best brunch options in the East Bay IMO, so I had to mention it here. I've never had a bad meal there. Huevos Rancheros Azteca, Blue Corn Pancakes, Eggs Benedict, it's all good here. And despite being (deservedly) popular on weekends, the wait typically isn't that bad. 

- Simurgh (San Pablo, right next to Arizmendi) has the same espresso options that Arizmendi has, but they're open on days when Arizmendi isn't, plus they offer Turkish style coffee and a number of delicious sandwiches on fresh baked Turkish bread. They also have a lovely mint lemonade that's perfect for beating the heat.

1mcw7wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1mcw7wc/welp_i_finally_told_my_coworker_crush_i_liked_him/,Welp… I finally told my coworker crush I liked him…,"Long story short, I last summer/fall for a few months I was hooking up with my coworker. Naturally I caught feelings because to be honest he is an exceptionally thoughtful, smart, and kind guy who is the first person in a couple years I’ve truly thought I could see myself dating. 

A bit after we started HU things went south - candidly I think I overshared some, he was newly single, we were coworkers, etc etc. 

The issue was I never stopped liking him. 

So, in about May I FELT like he suddenly did a 180 on me & was much more warm towards me than he had been in the past 6-7 months (since fall). 

A variety of things led to this, ALL of my girlfriends agreed, even watched us at a party once and insisted it wasn’t in my head & he seemed to like me back (I don’t have the type of friends who lie we are brutally honest).

Today I heard he had a date & I’ll be honest, my stomach dropped to my feet & I knew I just needed to finally say something about my feelings because sitting with the uncertainty was eating me alive, and also feeling like I didn’t know where I stood with him just wasn’t going to work for me long term. 

So, being as we are coworkers and I didn’t have any opportunity in the foreseeable future to say something in real life outside of work, I texted him that I still liked him, essentially apologizing for last fall (I just feel like I didn’t handle things as privately as I should’ve), & saying I want to keep the whole thi ng separate of work, but ball is in his court. 

Well, turns out he had no clue at all I had feelings for him, & also has closed that concept off in his mind (dating a coworker & dating me I believe - one in the same I think)

He unfortunately had an incredible well written message, that was honest & kind. He stated how he thinks I’m an incredible person, apologized for any mixed signals & lack of closure/communication with his feelings in the fall. States he really enjoys our friendship, and banter and hopes it doesn’t need to change. Is open to coffee or whatever if I would like to talk any further & of course would keep this between us. 

So naturally, now I like him even more because he is truly as spectacular of a human as I thought. However the advice I need is…

How the hell do I keep a friendship with him that I have been viewing as flirting for essentially 6 months? That banter he enjoys is essentially my love language & one of the reasons I like him so much. The friendship he values is built in my head around us liking one another, which is totally one sided I guess. And 80% of the time I interact with him I leave the conversation being like “yeah that’s one of the things I truly adore about him” or “wow great another quality I like & hope to have in a future partner”… HOW CAN I BE NORMAL AND BE FRIENDS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO STOP LIKING HIM WHEN EVERYTHING HE DOES MAKES ME LIKE HIM MORE?!?

Any & all advice welcome - getting over someone shitty is 100000x easier than getting over an excellent guy. & seeing them 5 days a week/being friends-ish - just makes it that much harder :(

1mcw6lk,https://heribertocanocaro.substack.com/p/the-most-dangerous-game-b32,Chapter 18 Susan Regains Hope,"Susan heard the screams and broke into a run.

It was barely Tuesday, and the dumbass had already stepped into her bear trap. She grinned as ferns whipped against her arms and her boots chewed up the forest floor. Shotgun cocked, tucked tight into her shoulder, she ran with the kind of joy only a payday could bring. All she had to do was finish the job and she’d be a millionaire.

But then came a different sound.

A deep, guttural ROAR.

Susan froze.

That wasn’t human.

Her instincts kicked in, and she slid behind a tree. No amount of redneck bravado was going to win a shootout with a grizzly. She had two boxes of birdshot and one full bladder. Maybe—maybe—she could piss the bear off enough to earn a mercy kill.

The screams twisted higher, frantic and broken—but the roaring drowned them out.

Too curious to resist, Susan peeked around the tree.

She blinked. Then blinked again.

There, tangled in dirt and blood and snapped branches, was a bear mounted on the kid like it was fucking him. His screams had turned to gurgles. The bear’s jaws worked over his back, each crunch spraying red in every direction. He looked like a cherry pie someone tried to fist. And yet, somehow, the kid was still alive. His legs spasmed like a bug with its guts out.

Susan's stomach turned. Thank God she’d only had Funyuns, two Slim Jims, and coffee this morning. Any more and she’d be redecorating the woods.

But horror gave way to something worse.

Annoyance.

What the fuck, Smokey?

This was her kill. Her million. And now this Kodiak motherfucker was chewing through her ticket out of the trailer park like it was jerky.

Susan raised the shotgun. She could at least put the kid out of his misery before Smokey finished dessert.

But something caught her eye.

Movement—thirty yards out. Two silhouettes.

She crouched and dug into her pack, pulled out binoculars, and focused.

Two guys. One blond, filming. The other dark-haired, looking like he just shit his soul out.

Susan narrowed her eyes. Couldn’t remember what Greg looked like exactly—they all had that smug influencer face—but something in her gut told her the one not holding the camera was her guy.

She moved the binoculars back to the kid being mauled.

His eyes were wide, glazed. His mouth hung slack, drooling blood. The bear chomped down on the nape of his neck and ripped off a mouthful. A clean, wet pop. Spinal cord in its teeth.

Dead.

Dead as it gets.

Susan let out a breath she didn’t know she was holding. Not out of grief—fuck that—but relief. If Greg was still standing over there, watching, then her prize was still alive.

The bear, panting from the effort, dragged the mangled corpse into the woods. A red trail smeared behind it like a slug trail of death.

Susan tracked the two boys again.

Thing 1, the blonde, fussed with the camera. Thing 2—Greg, maybe—just stood there, face white, staring at the trees like they’d whispered a curse to him. Then they started talking. Arguing. Thing 1 said something that made Thing 2 flinch.

And then they started walking.

South.

Toward her.

Susan froze, her shotgun still gripped tight, heart thudding in her chest.

They passed twenty yards from her position—oblivious. Didn’t even glance her way.

As their backs disappeared through the brush, Susan grinned.

1mcw65s,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1mcw65s/solved_cafe_affetto_stuck_with_blinking_light_and/,[Solved] Cafe Affetto stuck with blinking light and incomplete cycle.,"Here’s how I fixed it (with some help from ChatGPT) — no manuals needed.


Hey everyone,

I recently fixed my GE Café Caffè Affetto espresso machine, and I wanted to share everything I learned — because this was not just a repair, it was a puzzle.
There’s no official repair manual and little to no detailed guidance online, so I had to figure it out step-by-step. ChatGPT helped me navigate and think things through, but many of the key insights came from first-hand trial and intuition.

⸻

💡 My issue:
	•	The machine would turn on, grind coffee, and start brewing.
	•	It would stop midway through the process — no full espresso, no puck ejection.
	•	After the failed cycle, the power light would blink, and no buttons worked anymore.
	•	Later, the problem evolved: the machine would only blink from the moment it powered on, doing nothing else.

⸻

🧠 What I discovered:

✅ Waste container logic flaw (this one was on me!)

This was one of the key breakthroughs — and something I figured out through observation and reasoning.

The machine does not detect waste level physically.
Instead, it counts how many brew cycles were completed.

In my case, my wife had been removing and reinserting the waste bin whenever the “empty” warning appeared — which reset the message, but didn’t actually empty the bin.

Over time, this caused:
	•	Used grounds to accumulate inside the machine, off the radar of any sensor;
	•	That buildup blocked the external rotational axis of the brew unit;
	•	Meanwhile, the internal piston continued moving normally;
	•	This desynchronized the brew unit’s rotation from the piston movement, causing a full breakdown.

That was the core issue.

⸻

❌ The piston paradox (and how ChatGPT got tripped up)

While ChatGPT was very helpful throughout the process — comparing structures, analyzing photos I sent, and guiding my thought process — at one point it insisted that I should install the brew unit gear with the piston fully extended, because it believed the machine would retract it on startup.

Problem is:
That didn’t match the physical layout of the machine.
There wasn’t room inside for the piston to start extended — it would hit the chassis on rotation.

In the end, I figured out that the correct alignment was:
	•	Piston fully retracted (all the way down);
	•	Gear slot aligned with its internal notch at 12 o’clock;
	•	Brew unit also pointing up (12 o’clock) to match that gear position.

ChatGPT admitted it was going off logic alone — and encouraged me to trust what I was seeing. That balance actually worked great — it helped me test my theories without blindly following what I was being told.

⸻

⚠️ A side problem: the magnet

While opening the protective cover for the motherboard, I accidentally dislodged a small round magnet that sits inside the plastic.

Without that magnet in place, the machine would blink from the moment it powered on, even before trying anything. That confused the whole diagnosis — I thought I’d made things worse.

Once I realized what it was and reinserted the magnet in its slot, the original behavior returned — the machine at least tried to move again.

This wasn’t related to the brewing issue, but it added an extra layer of confusion during the troubleshooting.

⸻

✅ Final fix:
	1.	I cleaned all compacted grounds from the internal path;
	2.	Realigned the gear slot to match the 12 o’clock notch;
	3.	Ensured the piston was fully down, and installed the gear and brew unit in sync;
	4.	Confirmed the magnet was in place;
	5.	Powered on the machine — and everything worked:
	•	Piston retracted properly;
	•	Brew unit rotated to ~3 o’clock (brew position);
	•	Espresso brewed;
	•	Puck ejected;
	•	No blinking;
	•	All buttons responsive again.

⸻

🙏 How ChatGPT helped (and when I pushed back)

This wasn’t a one-man job. ChatGPT was my thinking partner the entire time. I kept sending updates and photos, and it helped me:
	•	Understand the logic of brewing cycles;
	•	Track what had changed after each action;
	•	Spot patterns (like blinking behavior vs piston failure);
	•	Compare components with similar machines.

But I also had to push back when something didn’t feel right physically — especially with that piston alignment. That’s where human intuition and hands-on testing made the difference.

So yeah — it was teamwork.

💬 ChatGPT brought the theory, I brought the tools.

This machine is high-end, expensive, and quite complex mechanically.
It’s unacceptable that no service manual, no exploded diagrams, and no official repair documentation are provided to users.

You’re putting all the burden of repair on the community — which, thankfully, still comes through — but it shouldn’t be this way.

If you care about sustainability and product longevity, you need to empower your customers to fix what they own.

🔧 Extra Note: Accessing the rear gear alignment requires full disassembly

One important thing I didn’t mention earlier:
To properly access and realign the rear gear mechanism, you must fully disassemble the area surrounding the motherboard and gearbox housing. This is not a surface-level fix.

You’ll need to:
	•	Remove the motherboard’s protective shell;
	•	Expose the gearbox assembly;
	•	Locate the rear plastic slot where the main gear inserts.

Inside that plastic housing, there is a notch or raised tab that must align with the corresponding groove on the gear itself — that alignment is crucial to ensure the correct home position of both the piston and the brew unit rotation.

If you miss this alignment, the machine will try to operate with the mechanics out of sync, leading to more blinking errors and failed brews.

⸻

If you’re stuck with a similar issue, I’d be happy to share photos or more details.
Just reply — this machine was almost trashed, and now it’s back better than ever.
Thanks again, Chat. We did it. ☕

Not many first thoughts on this, not much to say at this point, just need to power through and try to see how much weight I can keep off. I woke up at like 3:30am and couldn't get back to sleep which is unusual. 

Breakfast 8am: (7/10): pop tart, dry, would be sad to have this cold... 20 seconds in the microwave though and we have a winner, again I wish I had 2, I know this won't keep me going, but it sure tastes good, got that chocolate all gooey...

Lunch 12:00: (5/10): Pretzel nut mix, dry again, and it comes with another swamp green lemon lime beverage, far from my favorite thing to wash it down with. (Not pictured, was busy sorry)

""Dinner"" 3pm: (7/10): Had the main early because I was struggling to focus, the chicken rice burrito is good, still kind of dry (there's a theme with this menu) However there's a subtle spice and fruitiness that compliments the chicken really well. The rice kind of dilutes some of the flavour and pads the meal out, more sauce would not hurt. I added the cheese and hot sauce powder after trying and figured they helped solve some of these problems, so the main is cohesive. 

Overall Score: 6.5/10: kind of hungry still, had dinner early. This is a fairly standard  menu to be honest, mostly forgettable and dry, but the main is solid and the pop tart is always fun. Tomorrow should be epic though... Pork sausage patty, maple flavoured!

Hi everyone,

I’ve been married for 15 years to my husband. Just in this past year, something inside me shifted. It was like a light turned on, and I suddenly realized — the life I've been living isn't normal or healthy.

What really opened my eyes was seeing other families — especially dads at my kids’ school and sports events — showing up early for soccer with coffee for their wives, carrying chairs, helping with the younger siblings. Meanwhile, I’m alone. My husband is still sleeping off a night of drinking, and I know when I come home, he’ll be angry. He’ll complain about the house, about how I’m not doing enough, and question why I can’t “do better.”

I’ve detached emotionally, but I still live in it every day. And lately, I find myself constantly daydreaming. Dreaming of a life where I have a supportive partner — someone who helps, who loves me, who tells me I’m beautiful and that I’m enough. Sometimes, those daydreams are the only thing that get me through the day. And it hurts to think that this life I dream of may never be mine.

Here’s my question: Why do we stay? I know it’s complicated — kids, finances, the house, the fear of the unknown. But I wish I was brave enough to take the leap. Right now, I just need to know I’m not alone in feeling this way.

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie**  
The Atlanta Dream (-4.5, implied probability \~71%) are the clear favorites against the Dallas Wings, and the stats back it up. Atlanta’s defense ranks 4th in the WNBA, allowing opponents to score just 74.2 points per game—a fortress so impenetrable, even a sieve would blush. Meanwhile, Dallas’s offense, which ranks 10th, has managed to outscore opponents by a grand total of… 3 points this season. That’s less than the number of three-pointers Tiffany Hayes averages per game (1.8).

The Dream’s star, Allisha Gray, is a triple threat: leading the team in scoring, assists, and three-pointers (2.4 per game). She’s the kind of player who makes highlight reels and defensive coordinators weep. Conversely, Dallas’s offense is so inconsistent that their “game plan” might as well be “hope for a traveling call.”

**Digest the News: Injuries, Rumors, and a Lack of Coffee**  
No major injuries disrupt Atlanta’s lineup, though one can’t help but wonder if their defense secretly runs on a diet of 12-hour naps and existential dread (for opponents). Dallas, on the other hand, has news of its own: their offense is so slow, it once lost a race to a sloth on a caffeine IV. Recent reports suggest their coaching staff is considering replacing the playbook with a Ouija board—anything for a spark of inspiration.

A lighter note: Dallas’s three-point shooting (led by Hayes at 1.8 per game) is about as reliable as a weather forecast in July. Atlanta’s defense, meanwhil

Hey trail fam 👋

I’ve been building a web app to solve a real problem I kept running into during long runs and races: fueling. It’s called FuelForm AI, and it generates personalized fueling plans based on your race type, effort, duration, and bladder/flask setup. It uses AI to factor in course details, elevation, product preferences, and even image uploads like race maps or Strava screenshots.

🛠️ It’s still in alpha, but functional and fast. I’m looking for feedback from real trail runners before a public launch. You have nothing to lose, it’s completely free (unless you want to buy me a coffee)! 

⸻

🔐 Access is limited right now

If you’re interested in testing and giving feedback, DM u/fuelformai for the link and access code. I’m keeping it invite-only for now to manage usage and stay focused on meaningful feedback.

You can also follow the project and join the conversation in the r/FuelForm subreddit.

⸻

What it does:

✅ Builds liquid-only or mixed fueling plans
✅ Analyzes race URLs and course images
✅ Customizes for your weight, intensity, preferred products
✅ Outputs clean, easy-to-follow fueling instructions

This is a solo project built by a trail runner for trail runners. Your input would mean a lot.

Thanks and happy trails 🏃‍♀️💨

Sharing my write up on MV in case it helps. My eldest is typical sulky teen.... my youngest wild one!

We stayed 3 nights in Santa Pension Elena... we got a family room which fit all 5 of us. The room is pretty basic, and small but had shower room. But for the price truly an amazing find. It had a very high mezzanine which my eldest took so he could escape a little from family dynamics. Given it was quite tight quarters they did well! We had to be v organised with our belongings!

 We loved the hostel vibe, free tea and coffee..we loved the free HUGE and TASTY breakfast. We enjoyed hanging out in the comman room and pretending we are in our 20s again. There were other families there.

We drove from San Jose...massive thunder storm on way. Took about 3 hours. We ate at 3RS in Santa Elena, you sit outside next to the truck. Great food and good price. 

Day 1 we went to cloud forest. I adored it...so magical. We had cloud and a bit of rain...it cleared during the afternoin. Personally I loved the cloud in the cloud forest and felt it was more magical with it... than when it disappeared. We saw a couti and armadillo.... we didn't have a guide. Our 2 youngest loved it. My eldest was quite underwhelmed walking in a wet forest but also this was our 1st main outing in CR. We walked all the paths probably around 9KM. The paths are well maintained and mostly flat (some are very pretty steep but you can avoid them). The brownies in the cafe are very tasty...

We ate again at 3Rs in the evening.

Day 2 we did El Tiger. The drive there was pretty hairy lots of pot holes.. though my partner (driver) found it fine just very slow going. We found out the night before that our youngest was free (under 6) and we recieved 15% off booking online. We went for the full package as honestly we are quite shocked by how much the food is generally in CR and felt the difference in price was worth it. The trail is a lot of steps up and down, I'm not the fittest so it was challenging, but far from impossible and definitely worth it. The waterfalls are incredible and the hanging bridges fun. We even swam in the last waterfall which was exhilarating. My children all enjoyed it...and even the eldest broke his shell. They took the horses back I took the 4x4....lunch was generous and tasty and the views incredible.... we all really enjoyed it. Recommended. We saw beautiful morpho butterflies and an armadillo.

In the evening we ate at Taco Taco... the food is super super tasty... and a refreshing change from rice and beans. Slightly more expensive than 3Rs but a fun restaurant.

Day 3. We headed to The Original Canopy Tour for a zipline experience. Stopping at the figus tree (amazing and free). We all did the tour.... my daughter zipped mostly on her own and sometimes with the guide. She was incredibly brave. The most scary part was standing on the platforms waiting and the climb up the ladder (me and my daughter did not do this). I admit it was a bit too much for me... adrenaline and fear wise... but we did it and the kids LOVED it. It's the cheapest zipline option I've found and seriously it was enough adrenaline especially with the tartan swing!

Weather has been fine... some heavier rain in the afternoon but mostly after we have finished activities. We did need a jumper in the evening. We are coming from UK so are making the most of our jetlag  and getting up early!

Next stop samara.

There will be DFIR (digital forensic and incident response) engagements on going in support of the lawsuits.

1.) If you're downloading the breached data, cover your tracks. Use Tor, with a VPN, and private DNS if you can. Use public WiFi from a coffee shop, even better. Tor exit nodes can sometimes be compromised giving visibility to your public IP. 

2) Hopefully, whomever initially pulled the data from the Firebase buckets took a forensic, read only, hash of the original version. This is necessary to be admissable in court.

3) Be cautious that you are in possession of data that was already being ILLEGALLY held by the Tea App, then illegally taken. This is considered ""vigilante hacking"" and still a crime. Many of the images violate DMCA copyright laws and also sounds like revenge porn shared in the women's messages. The Tea App WAS ALREADY DISTRIBUTING AND HOSTING ILLEGAL DATA, the breached downloads are technically illegal too.

4) Unfortunately, using ""hacked data"" towards criminal charges or court cases faces heavy scrutiny since the chain of custody has been broken. It's extremely difficult to prove that the data hasn't been tampered with. Even with ethical motives the data can be thrown out as evidence without a forensic image and chain of custody.

HOWEVER, the breached data could potentially be used to justify a criminal investigation from law enforcement into the Tea App and obtain official forensic images by warrant to support any court hearing. If they try to delete data to cover their tracks, they'll get into even more trouble.

5) Whistleblowers or journalists may receive a copy of the hacked data and use it so long as they did not participate in the actual breach and it's in the public interest. This is a legal gray area.

6) If you find that screenshots of your personal dating profiles have been used on the platform file a DMCA take down notice. The Tea App is legally required to respond within a set amount of time. There are instructions pinned here in the sub. There is also an App created by a law firm called Quick DMCA that will file takedown notices for you. The app costs $4.99. Disclaimer: I have not used the app before, but it's backed by a law firm who handles copyright law.

Overrun the shit out of Tea with DMCA notices. They are required to respond within 10-14 days. Affected men have the opportunity to bury them legally and financially right now.

These two breaches are going to generate massive civil and criminal concerns at both a class action and individual case level. Class action for women due to data privacy negligence and individual criminal and civil charges from men towards women who have harmed them. Hopefully, there will be a class action lawsuit representing men too. That part could come forward later after investigation is started on the breach itself and the illegal content ""legally discovered"".

In all. Be smart with the data and cautious about how you share it. Remain anonymous the best you can. I know the majority is trying to do what's morally right and hold the Tea members accountable for their behavior. We need to be pressuring hard for equal justice in every way we can. No more being harassed, stalked, threatened, slandered, defamed and then just ignored because we are men.

# Best Water Bottle to Keep Water Cold [2025 Guide]

Staying hydrated is essential for overall health and well-being, especially during physical activities or in hot weather. Choosing the right water bottle can make a notable difference in your hydration habits, ensuring that your water remains refreshingly cold for extended periods. This guide focuses on the best water bottles available in 2025 designed to keep your water cold, examining their key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated best water bottle to keep water cold on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=best water bottle to keep water cold)

## key Features Analysis

The best water bottles for keeping water cold typically incorporate features designed to minimize heat transfer and maintain the water's temperature for as long as possible. These features include double-wall vacuum insulation, high-quality materials, and airtight seals.

**Double-Wall Vacuum Insulation:** Double-wall vacuum insulation creates a barrier between the inner and outer walls of the bottle, minimizing heat transfer through conduction and convection. A vacuum space between the walls significantly reduces the rate at which the water inside heats up due to external temperatures, allowing it to stay cold for hours, or even days, depending on the ambient conditions and the quality of the insulation.

**High-Quality Materials:** Most top-tier water bottles are constructed from 18/8 food-grade stainless steel, known for its durability, resistance to rust and corrosion, and lack of flavor retention. Stainless steel is also non-toxic and doesn't leach harmful chemicals into the water, ensuring that your drink remains pure and safe. Alternative materials like Tritan plastic might potentially be BPA-free and lighter, but generally don't offer the same level of insulation as stainless steel.

**Airtight Seals:** An airtight seal is crucial for preventing leaks and maintaining the temperature of the water inside. Bottles with secure, leak-proof lids not only prevent spills but also help to minimize air exchange, further reducing heat transfer. Often, the lid construction involves multiple layers of silicone or rubber gaskets to create a tight, reliable closure.

**Wide-Mouth Opening:** A wide-mouth opening facilitates easy filling,cleaning,and adding ice cubes. The larger opening allows you to quickly replenish your water supply and easily scrub the inside of the bottle to maintain hygiene. Some bottles also offer narrower spouts or integrated straws for convenient drinking.

**Powder Coating:** A durable powder coating on the exterior of the bottle provides a comfortable grip and protects it from scratches and dents. This coating also adds an extra layer of insulation, further minimizing heat transfer.The texture of the powder coating can improve the overall user experience by making the bottle easier to handle, notably in wet or humid conditions.

Key features of the best water bottles to keep water cold include:

*   Double-wall vacuum insulation
*   18/8 food-grade stainless steel construction

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have specific questions about the functionality, maintenance, and compatibility of water bottles designed to keep water cold. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.

**How long will the water stay cold in these bottles?**
The duration that water stays cold depends on various factors, including the ambient temperature, the initial temperature of the water, and the quality of the bottle's insulation. Though, most high-quality, double-wall vacuum insulated bottles can keep water cold for 12-24 hours, and some can even maintain ice for up to 48 hours. Factors like repeatedly opening the bottle or leaving it in direct sunlight will reduce the duration of cold retention.

**Are these water bottles dishwasher safe?**
While some water bottles are advertised as dishwasher safe, it is generally recommended to hand wash stainless steel bottles to preserve their insulation and finish. High temperatures and harsh detergents in dishwashers can potentially damage the vacuum seal or affect the coating. The lids are often dishwasher safe, but always check the manufacturer's instructions.

**Can these water bottles be used for hot beverages?**
Yes,most double-wall vacuum insulated water bottles are also capable of keeping hot beverages hot for extended periods. The same insulation technology that keeps cold liquids cold also works to retain heat. Typical hot retention is around 6-12 hours, depending on the same factors influencing cold retention. However, be cautious when using hot beverages, as the bottle's exterior will remain cool to the touch despite the contents being hot.**how do I clean these water bottles effectively?**
To clean these bottles effectively, use warm, soapy water and a bottle brush to scrub the interior. Baking soda can be added to the water to help remove any stubborn stains or odors. For the lid, disassemble any removable parts and wash them thoroughly with soap and water. Allow all components to dry fully before reassembling. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads,as they can scratch the stainless steel or damage the coating.

I'm **Tourou**, a longtime sci-fi and fantasy fan — and a new author releasing my first web novel, ***The Ashbound***.

It’s a story about **soul-bound warriors**, **forbidden love**, and **a world collapsing under celestial invasion**. Think *Final Fantasy meets Evangelion* with a touch of wuxia mythos. I’ve been quietly working on this world for years, and now I’m finally sharing it.

**Title:** *The Ashbound*  
**Genre:** Sci-fi Fantasy / Alien Evolution / Forbidden Romance  
**Tags:** Winged Protagonist, Soul Bond, Faction Conflict, Magic-meets-Technology, Earth in Ruin

**Blurb:**  
Earth is fractured — ravaged by celestial invasions and divided by factions that once fought to protect it. Jinhai Rush, a Deepwell operative with a soul-bound Filial, carries a power he doesn’t fully understand… and a secret romance with a woman bred to destroy him.  
But when a fourth Titan awakens — Medusa — the world’s fragile balance is shattered.  
Now, love, lineage, and war collide.

**Prologue – The Second Dawn**

 

The sea was calm. Too calm, some would later say.

 

A rusting trawler drifted across the open Atlantic, sunlight glinting off its hull. The fishermen aboard moved with the relaxed rhythm of routine — laughter, shouted instructions, the splash of bait fish hitting the waves. It could’ve been any summer morning on any quiet ocean.

 

But there were no rods. No lines. No reels.

 

Above the boat, circling the air like hawks, flew five winged figures — lean, humanoid silhouettes backlit by the sun. Their wings stretched wide and powerful, feathers tipped in iridescent metal. From a distance, they could be mistaken for birds. Up close, they were unmistakably human — or something close to it.

 

The crew called them Solborn. Children of sky and storm. Hunters reborn from a war the world had tried to forget.

 

One of the Solborn gave a sharp whistle and pointed to a rippling patch in the water — shadows, shifting fast beneath the surface.

“Bluefin!” someone yelled.

 

The closest Solborn tucked his wings and dove, a silver net unfolding from his arms like a blooming flower. He vanished into the sea with a thundercrack, sending spray skyward. Moments later, he exploded back out, dragging a thrashing bluefin nearly half his size.

 

Cheers erupted from the deck.

“Good catch!”

“That’s three today!”

“For once, the sea’s kind.”

 

They shouldn’t have said that.

 

The first tremor was gentle — a subtle pulse beneath their boots.

 

The second came harder. The water shifted strangely. Not a wave. A pull.

 

The fish vanished. Just… scattered. Gone, like smoke on the wind.

“Something’s wrong,” muttered the old man at the bow. His hands clenched the rail. “This isn’t a current.”

 

The surface began to swell. Not rise — swell, like something beneath it was breathing. A spiral formed, slow at first, then widening faster than the eye could track. Waves churned outward in every direction, but the center kept pulling down, down, down.

 

Then the sea broke open.

 

The water didn’t just swirl — it collapsed. The ocean floor gave way with a sound like a planet cracking. The whirlpool widened, and widened still, until the trawler was a mere speck inside its mouth.

 

They could no longer see the horizon.

 

Everywhere they looked — east, west, bow, stern — was nothing but darkness. The entire world had turned into a spinning void. It swallowed the light, the sky, the sea itself. A monstrous vortex where gravity failed and reason collapsed.

 

The boat began to sink.

 

Not violently — but inevitably. Slowly. Gracefully. Like a stone swallowed by the stars.

 

The engine screamed in reverse, but the hull didn’t lurch. It simply drifted downward, slipping beneath the surface without a splash. Every sound grew muted. Every breath felt thinner.

“Where’s the sea?” someone whispered.

“It’s still here,” another murmured, voice trembling. “We’re just not in it anymore.”

 

Time stretched. The deck tilted forward by degrees. The sky faded to a ring of light above. Then even that disappeared.

 

And rising with them, from that unnatural abyss, came something worse.

 

It rose slow, deliberate, like it had waited to be seen.

 

It was a god cast in flesh and shadow.

 

A hulking mass of muscle and dark-purple scale, its body sculpted with grotesque perfection — a colossal barrel chest heaving with unnatural rhythm, arms so massive they dwarfed its own torso, each ending in claws that looked forged for extinction. Its waist tapered into a narrower core, only to explode again into titanic, corded legs thick enough to anchor a mountain.

 

Its shoulders jutted upward into sharp, armor-like points, like a crown of blades. There was no neck — only an empty collar of bone and obsidian flesh, from which a formless head emerged like flowing smoke. No mouth. No face. Just a pair of burning eyes — yellow rimmed in red — that pierced the dark like judgment itself.

 

Its wings spread behind it, silent and endless, casting a shadow large enough to drown a city block. It did not speak. It did not roar. It simply was — a being that unmade meaning by standing still.

 

It shrieked — high and sharp, like a blade dragged across a dying world.

 

The trawler crumbled in its grip, reduced to shrapnel in a heartbeat. Men died without even time to scream. Flocks of Solborn fled in every direction, breaking formation, wings scattering light like torn banners in retreat.

 

The beast turned skyward, sensing more.

 

Miles away, underground, the walls of Deepwell Outpost Theta pulsed red.

 

A young analyst stared at the readings on her console, sweat rolling down her neck.

 

\[ANOMALY: CODE BLACK\]

 \[SIGNATURE MATCH: DRACONIAN. CLASS: UNKNOWN.\]

 \[SEISMIC RADIUS: 2700 KM. ESTIMATED MASS: >400,000 TONS.\]

 \[GATE STRUCTURE: FAILING.\]

 \[THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\]

 

She didn’t hesitate to press the call button.

“Sir,” she said into the receiver, her voice brittle. “It’s begun.”

 

The man on the other end — a commander in an unmarked chamber lined with relics from a dozen wars — took a slow breath.

 

Then he opened three channels at once.

“UNEX Federation. Code Black. Full mobilization.”

 “Deepwell Foundation. Initiate Omega Directive.”

 “Ecclesia Callei. Notify the Choir. Light the signal.”

 

A long silence followed.

 

Then, almost to himself: “We were never going to stop it. Only survive the first wave.”

 

Above the Atlantic, the first Draconian spread its wings wide and cast its shadow across the waters of Earth.

 

The war for humanity’s survival had begun.

 

And the sky was no longer safe.

 

**Chapter 1 – Jinhai**

 

The city never really slept anymore. Not since the Blooming, the event that changed the world forever.   
  
From up there—perched on the edge of a hollowed-out high-rise near the East River—I could see the whole skeleton of the Brooklyn Bridge stretching across the water. Its spine was cracked, metal ribs exposed like the broken bones of some ancient beast. They had been trying to mend it for months.  
   
But there were no cranes. No scaffolding. No roaring machines.  
   
Only wings.  
   
Solborn construction workers soared between the broken struts, each one unique—some feathered, some leathery, others veined like glass. A woman with fiery red pinions lifted a steel beam like it was made of cardboard. A man with crow-black wings hovered beside her, holding a fusion torch in one hand and sipping coffee with the other.  
   
Below them, more walked on the bridge itself—massive figures with talons instead of boots, hoisting reinforced pillars and snapping them into place with their bare hands. The air was filled with the rhythmic hum of wingbeats and the occasional laughter echoing between towers.  
   
Above, the sky lanes glowed with flowing traffic—suspended roads for flying cars, some autonomous, others piloted by humans and Solborn alike. A flock of teenagers zoomed past in a trail of laughter. One of them carried a girl on his back—a human, judging by the way she clutched his neck and grinned like the wind could carry her worries away.  
   
It was almost beautiful. Almost normal.  
   
But I knew better.  
   
My wrist buzzed.  
   
I tapped the interface, and with a mellow chime, the projection came to life. My master, Orin Thal’s face appeared—calm, timeless, his expression as unreadable as always. He looked more like a monk than the most powerful man in the Deepwell Foundation. Robes loose at the collar, a faint glow in his eyes. Not the alien Filial soul energy—something older. Centered.  
   
He skipped any greeting, but not out of coldness. Just urgency.  
”There’s been a disturbance,” he said. “Lower Manhattan. A city block is... unraveling. The Filial bonds that have merged with humans there are failing. We’re seeing soul separation. Collapse.”  
   
I frowned. That shouldn’t have been possible.  
   
He watched me for a moment before continuing. “The United Nations for Extraterrestrial Defense (UNEX) is calling it contamination. The Filial-worshiping celestial church Ecclesia Calie calls it corruption. Both are guessing.”  
   
He leaned forward slightly. His voice lowered.  
“I don’t believe this is illness, Jinhai. Not in any way the body understands it. This feels… off-pattern. Like something deeper is being disturbed.”  
   
I didn’t speak. He didn’t expect me to  
“The Church wants to purge it. UNEX wants to seal it. But both are using hammers to fix broken glass.”  
   
His gaze sharpened.  
“Go. See it with your own eyes. Help them, if that’s what’s needed. But don’t assume they know what they’re dealing with. I need your judgment, not theirs.”  
   
 Then, warmer:  
 “And Jinhai… listen carefully. Sometimes the silence speaks louder than the noise.”  
   
The projection faded.  
   
I closed the holo, and for a moment I just breathed—watching the world as it glided around me.  
   
My armor adjusted slightly, molding tighter across my shoulders. Matte black from collar to boot, threaded with silent filaments of light. Diamond-shaped orbs pulsed on my arms and legs, quiet but alive. The one at my chest glowed brightest—cross-shaped, slow and steady, like a heartbeat.  
   
Two black scapulars hung between my legs—lightweight, ceremonial, and unnecessary. But I wore them anyway. A reminder of who I served. Of what I was made to protect.  
   
My wings unfurled behind me with a hushed ripple of energy. Feathers white as moonlight, haloed in a faint, shifting blue. They glowed when I focused. When I breathed with intention.  
   
People down there looked up when they saw me. I knew the look.  
   
 Awe. Curiosity. Sometimes fear.  
   
But mostly… recognition.  
   
Because I wasn’t just another Solborn. Not to them. Not to Deepwell.  
   
I was born before the treaties. Before the world agreed to coexist with the sky.  
   
 Before anyone knew what I was.  
   
I stepped to the edge of the rooftop, boots grinding softly against scorched ferrocrete. The wind tugged at the loose strands of white hair that forever refused to stay slicked back. I exhaled slowly, centering myself. In the fading twilight, I lingered a moment, watching the sun slip behind the old bridge—a final breath of beauty before the storm. It reminded me why I fought.  
   
Then—I spread my wings.  
   
They unfurled with a whisper of frictionless air, white as frost, each feather laced with threads of energy humming at the edge of vision. A pale blue glow gathered around them, pulsating quietly. The light grew brighter… hotter… until flame replaced form. My wings burned—blue fire wreathed in silence, devouring no oxygen, emitting no smoke. They weren’t just appendages. They were memory. Inheritance. Bond.  
   
I leaned forward—and fell.  
   
No flap. No thrust. Just motion.  
   
The wind parted around me like reverence.  
   
Above the city, suspended between history and heaven, a holographic interface shimmered to life across my forearm. Golden grids spun into focus, mapping Manhattan’s sprawl in clean layers. Red blotches throbbed on the lower east side. A glitch? No. The anomaly had grown again. I swiped left; new readings populated the air, tracking soul frequency destabilization across five blocks.  
   
 I narrowed my eyes. “Too fast,” I muttered.  
   
 As I banked westward, the southern skyline drew into view—and with it, the impossible.  
   
There, off the shore, piercing the clouds like the hand of a god, stood the Helix Basilica—Ecclesia Callei’s celestial fortress. It spiraled into the sky in golden coils, its light like amber fire in the mist. Larger than any Earth-born structure, the Basilica was part temple, part control tower, part message to the stars.  
   
 I hated it.  
   
Fifteen years ago, I thought, that spiral rose from the sea like a weed through stone. Not to worship… but to watch. To judge.  
   
Built to monitor the Mawline Rift—a vast gravitational scar 300 miles southeast of Manhattan where the Ark tore open the Earth’s crust—the Basilica served as Ecclesia’s sanctum and surveillance tower. They called it a safeguard.  
   
 I called it a cage.  
   
 I veered away from its golden glow, letting the city fill my vision.  
   
 New York. Once steel and soot, now a fractured cathedral of contrasts. Stone towers from centuries past jutted between smooth-filament skyscrapers woven from Filial alloy. Holograms danced on broken facades. Solar sails clung to domes that still bore the scars of the last Draconian siege. Some structures hadn’t been repaired—intentionally. Memorials, perhaps. Or warnings.  
   
 A shadow moved below.  
   
 I slowed my pace.  
   
 Two Solborn teens zipped between buildings, their wings barely mature—flickering like candlelight. One banked too sharply and clipped a rusted lamppost with a loud clang. The boy spun wildly before catching himself, laughter echoing in the morning air.  
   
 I smiled faintly.  
   
 Still learning. Still crashing. At least they’re not afraid to fly.  
   
 For a moment, I hovered—just above the clouds, watching my city. It was bruised but breathing. Beautiful and broken.  
   
 The HUD pinged again.  
   
 One block pulsed red-hot.  
   
 I turned toward it—eyes narrowing, wings flaring silently—and descended.  
   
 I descended in a slow spiral, the blue fire of my wings dimming as he neared the rooftops. The wind carried with it the buzz of power generators, the low rumble of news drones, and the crackle of tension. The block below had been cordoned off in a tight perimeter—UNEX barricades projecting hardlight fences, shimmering with flickers of static as civilians pressed too close.  
   
A crowd had gathered. Solborns and humans alike stood shoulder-to-shoulder behind the glowing lines, faces turned upward. They had that look—the uneasy curiosity of those who had seen too much in their lifetime, yet knew enough to worry when the unexpected showed up.  
   
 A familiar chorus rang out:  
 “Is that Deepwell?”  
 “That’s a Deepwell suit!”  
 “Oh god… they don’t come unless—”  
 “No way… That’s Jinhai Rush.”  
   
I touched down silently, boots hissing as kinetic force dispersed through the landing matrix embedded in my soles. My wings extinguished into wisps of smoke and light, leaving only the shadow-slick plating of the Deepwell Foundation suit behind—smooth armor etched with diamond-shaped orbs that pulsed once, then dimmed.  
   
 All at once, the murmuring shifted to panic.  
 “They sent him?”  
 “Is it a Draconian breach?”  
 “Someone check the Rift monitors—!”  
 “No, no—this is local. Deepwell doesn’t move unless it’s internal.”  
   
 Camera lenses pivoted like a hundred eyes snapping into focus. Holo-reporters hovered into range, voice filters engaging with seamless clarity.  
 “Breaking now—Deepwell Foundation has officially deployed a field operative to the anomaly site in Lower Manhattan. Sources on-site confirm visual ID of Jinhai Rush, high-ranking Deepwell agent and survivor of the second dawn.”  
 “The last time Deepwell sent someone this high-profile into the field, it was during the Coney Island invasion.”  
 “UNEX and Ecclesia forces remain unresponsive to our requests for clarification.”  
   
 That last line rang truer than expected.  
   
 A ripple of movement tore through the ranks of UNEX soldiers near the perimeter checkpoint. Their armor—sleek, urban-issue exo suits painted in neutral greys—parted to reveal a man stomping forward. A captain, by the crimson stripe on his chestplate and the badge flickering at his collar. His eyes locked on Jinhai like a missile.  
 “Knew it,” the captain muttered as he approached. “No comms. No clearance. No chain of command. Just drop out of the sky like a damn omen.”  
   
 He stopped just outside of Jinhai’s personal radius, jaw tight, hands on his hips.  
 “You want to tell me why Deepwell suddenly cares about a containment op we’ve had locked down for six hours?”  
   
 I tilted my head slightly. “Looks like the panic started before I arrived.”  
 “Don’t get clever,” the captain snapped. “UNEX has jurisdiction. Ecclesia sanctified the perimeter. If this was a joint op, you’re late—and if it’s not, you’re trespassing.”  
   
My gaze remained cool. “There are fluctuations in the anomaly readings your field scans aren’t picking up. Filial destabilization isn’t just spiritual—it’s structural. I’m not here to step on your chain of command, Captain. I’m here because this isn’t containment. It’s collapse.”  
   
The captain’s expression didn’t change, but something flickered behind his eyes.  
   
 He exhaled through his nose, tapped his comm-link, and turned away. “Of course it’s collapse,” he muttered. “It’s always collapse when Deepwell shows up.”  
   
 Above them, a news anchor’s voice echoed from a public holo-feed:  
 “For those just tuning in, tensions continue to rise as Deepwell agent Jinhai Rush appears on-site. The uneasy alliance between the three major forces—UNEX, Ecclesia Callei, and the Deepwell Foundation—has long been a point of public speculation. Deepwell, often criticized for its isolationism and lack of transparency, rarely intervenes outside Rift-adjacent anomalies.”  
   
 A second anchor added, “UNEX officers on the ground seem unaware of the Foundation’s presence prior to the arrival, suggesting a possible breach in protocol… or something bigger than anyone expected.”  
   
I walked past the line of soldiers, eyes scanning the flickering readouts from my wrist. The anomaly was near—close enough that the air had begun to vibrate.  
   
The street ahead was cracked, buildings leaning at odd angles, and something deeper… darker… pulsed beneath the asphalt.  
   
 Whatever was happening here, it wasn’t just soul decay.  
   
 It was something new.  
   
Something wrong.  
   
The captain’s voice returned a moment later, tight with forced neutrality. “You’ve been greenlit. Higher-ups say it came from Orin Thal himself. So fine—go play your part.”  
   
He didn’t wait for a response, already walking away. Probably to report back that Deepwell was stepping into his jurisdiction again.  
   
Jinhai watched him leave, then slowly turned back toward the hot zone.  
   
The UNEX soldiers standing guard didn’t meet my eyes. Their faces were hidden behind standard-issue helmets, visors glowing faintly red. Their armor looked pristine—retooled just this year, judging by the humming resonance packs on their spines and the tri-channel capacitors on their arms.  
   
 All of it powered by Filial converters—technology lifted from Deepwell archives, repurposed, weaponized.  
   
 Leeches, I thought.  
   
There was no reverence in their use of it. No understanding of what it meant to channel the Filial soul energy. Deepwell spent years learning to listen to those wavelengths—harmonize with them. To form bonds, not shackles. The entire purpose of a Filial entity was unity: merging, trust, resonance.  
   
 UNEX didn’t care.  
   
 They didn’t want harmony. They wanted horsepower.  
   
To them, a Filial soul is just a high-output battery, I thought bitterly. Another piece of equipment to slot into a weapon system or body mod. It is a gift, not a tool.   
And they called it protection.  
   
Deepwell had spent decades studying both Filials and Draconians—not just to fight, but to understand. Every artifact, every anomaly, every battle-scarred ruin was a lesson. Their goal wasn’t domination. It was preservation. Humanity didn’t need another conqueror. It needed a memory. A conscience.  
   
 UNEX was the opposite. All iron and ego. They dressed up control as security and called it righteous.  
   
 They build walls and prisons. We build questions and answers.  
   
 And here they were—standing on the same battlefield, watching the same sickness spread beneath their feet.  
   
 It made my skin crawl.  
   
I exhaled slowly, reaching up to brush my fingers across the diamond-shaped node embedded in my collar.  
   
 A low hum answered. The orb pulsed once.  
 “Let’s see what you’re hiding,” I whispered to the city.  
   
 And with that, I stepped deeper into the infected zone.  
   
As I stepped inside, the hairs on the back of my neck rose instinctively. Everything felt off. I sensed it — the energy had turned, sharp and unnatural.  
   
The lights were out. Darkness swallowed everything. The cross-shaped orb at the center of my chest began to glow, casting a narrow beam of light as I moved down the corridor.""  
   
I reached the lobby—and froze.  
   
Dozens of Solborns lay scattered across the floor, bodies suspended mid-motion. Each face locked in agony, mouths open, eyes wide, but unmoving. Attempts to touch them were repelled by an invisible forcefield. A faint field extended from each body, warping the space around them, bending light to form ghost-like afterimages—outlines of their limbs and expressions, disjointed in time.  
   
I tapped at the omnitool on my wrist—proprietary Deepwell tech.  
   
 Static.  
   
 Interference.  
   
 I crouched and gathered dust from a cracked tile, then blew it gently into the air.  
   
Instead of drifting naturally, it split into rectangular streaks, pulling downward in clean vertical channels. Not atmospheric. Not spiritual.  
   
A gravitational field.  
   
This wasn’t a disease.  
   
I stood. My Eyes closed. I pressed my index and middle finger to my temple.  
   
The orbs on my armor flared to life, glowing brighter and brighter. My body filled with power.  
With energy.  
We called it Filial Resonance.  
Energy pulsed outward in waves — from my core, through my suit, and into the earth itself. I reached into the Resonance, attuning to the subtle vibrations woven beneath the physical world.  
   
In my mind’s eye, the city block unfolded in layered clarity — buildings, structural voids, heat signatures, soul echoes.  
I found them. The victims.  
   
 Then—something else.  
   
 Far below the building, a hollow space. Two hundred feet down. A gravitational sink, tugging at every thread of Filial energy in the vicinity — draining it.  
   
 Feeding on it.  
   
 An underground world, hidden in the dark. Alive.  
   
 But first—the survivors.  
   
I increased the frequency of the energy pulses — gently, precisely. Then, with a subtle shift, I reversed the downward flow, redirecting it outward. A barrier formed beneath my feet, blocking the anomaly’s pull like a dam against a draining tide.  
   
Only then did I turn my attention to the victims.  
   
Their Filial resonance had unraveled — severed from their core frequency. Of course. That was it. The Filial soul energy, once harmonized with the body, had become desynchronized. Unanchored, it hovered just out of reach, leaving the body in stasis — hollow and fading.  
   
Without that resonance, the body would fail. The soul would fracture.  
   
I exhaled slowly and focused.  
 







Like a careful stitchworker threading a torn seam, I began to mend the connection — aligning the threads of Filial and human essence one by one. My hands moved in measured gestures, sending pulses of calming wavelength across the ruptured field. The glow of my chest orb softened. Resonance returned, gentle and warm.  
   
 And then — breath.  
   
The effect was immediate.  
   
The victims gasped as the light-warped afterimages snapped back into place, merging with flesh and bone.  
   
Some coughed. Others groaned. Eyes fluttered open, dazed and searching.  
   
One by one, they returned. Confused, but alive.  
“Go,” I said, my voice steady. “Now. While you still can.”  
They rose shakily, dazed but moving. A few murmured thanks before fleeing toward the exits.  
   
Outside, the media caught the chaos on live broadcast. Reporters scrambled to confirm that the victims had been “cured.”  
   
But Ecclesia Callei priests were already closing in—demanding the victims be quarantined for questioning. Golden-robed enforcers blocked the path, holding firm with practiced resolve.  
   
The crowd turned ugly.  
   
Shouts erupted.  
   
Bottles and scraps of debris flew.  
   
The Ecclesian priests didn’t flinch.  
   
They raised their arms in tandem, golden robes billowing with divine authority. Each one glowed with a yellow aura, but the higher-ranking priests stood apart—white halos of radiant light arched behind their backs like glowing rings, framing their heads in sanctified brilliance.  
   
One of the lesser priests unfurled a ceremonial lasso—threaded with radiant cords—and cast it into the crowd. It snapped around a protester’s waist.  
“Rehabilitation is required,” the priest declared.  
   
Gasps.  
   
Silence.  
 

The rest of the crowd fell quiet, shrinking back in fear.  
   
Inside the building, I stepped toward the center of the floor and let his wings blaze back to life—blue flames erupting into shape. I raised my right arm. The flame of my right wing coalesced, twisting inward and wrapping around my forearm like a living helix of plasma.  
   
It became a drill.  
   
An energy-formed, flame-wreathed weapon forged from will and soul.  
   
I found the weakest point in the floor and slammed downward.  
   
Stone cracked. Steel screamed. Dust erupted.  
   
I drilled through what seemed like ten stories, then through concrete, then soil. Then two-hundred feet down, I stopped, nothing was there to drill —I hovered in the void.  
   
 An underground cavern yawned before me.  
   
 Empty.  
   
 Except for the eggs.  
   
Dozens—maybe thousands—of black-scaled, barrel-sized eggs lined the floor in uneven rows. Each one shimmered faintly in the dark, the membranes pulsing in tune with something ancient and hostile.  
   
 It was a nest.  
   
 And it wasn’t abandoned.  
   
 Behind me, a hiss.  
   
 I turned—and locked eyes with death.  
   
Twin red eyes burned in a plume of black smoke, coalescing into sinew, claws, and wings.The beast emerged slowly into the narrow beam of my armor’s light — twenty feet tall, all jagged limbs and leathery wings, its scales were so black they swallowed the light itself.  
   
Its body shimmered between flesh and smoke, wings half-formed, spine jagged. Its black-scaled hide absorbed every trace of light, giving it the illusion of a living void.  
   
It opened its jaws.  
   
And smiled.

The next morning, the sun was shining, birds were chirping, and Dipper was half-asleep as he dragged himself into Greasy’s Diner.

""Remind me again why I'm awake at this ungodly hour?"" Dipper mumbled, rubbing his eyes.

""It’s noon, dude,"" Wendy said, smirking.

Stan scoffed. ""Back in my day, kids weren’t a bunch of lazy bums. We woke up at 5 AM, milked the cows, fought off highway bandits, and still made it home in time for breakfast!""

Dipper blinked. ""You grew up in Jersey.""

""Exactly!"" Stan huffed. ""We had Jersey bandits.""

Wendy chuckled as she led them to a booth. Dipper sat down across from Stan, still suspicious.

""Alright, Wendy, you’ve been acting weird all morning. What’s this ‘big surprise’ you won’t tell me about?""

Wendy just smirked. ""Relax, dude. You’ll see soon enough.""

Dipper narrowed his eyes. ""That’s exactly what people say before they throw you into a pit of snakes.""

""Trust me, it's not snakes. But that would be hilarious,"" Wendy teased.

Dipper groaned, resting his forehead on the table. ""I swear, if this is some kind of prank—""

Before he could finish, Wendy casually turned to the nearest waitress. ""Hey, bring her in.""

The waitress nodded and walked off. Dipper sat up, confused. ""Wait, who are you bringing in?""

Wendy just smirked. ""You’ll see.""

Dipper looked at Stan for help, but the old man just sipped his coffee. ""Don’t look at me, kid. I just came for the free refills.""

Dipper sighed, shaking his head. ""Why do I feel like I’m about to regret this?""

Then, the sound of approaching footsteps made him turn his head—

—and he froze.

Standing just a few feet away, looking just as shocked as he was—

Pacifica Northwest.

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The entire diner seemed to go silent, as if the universe itself was pausing for dramatic effect.

Pacifica’s eyes widened. ""Dipper?!""

Dipper blinked. ""Pacifica?!""

Stan looked between them, then muttered, ""Welp. This just got interesting.""

Pacifica fidgeted, clearly caught off guard. ""I… I didn't know you were back in town.""

Dipper rubbed the back of his neck. ""Yeah… surprise?""

Wendy grinned, leaning back in her seat. ""Mission accomplished. You’re welcome.""

Dipper shot her a glare. ""Wendy! You planned this?!""

Wendy shrugged. ""Hey, you haven’t seen each other in, what? Ten years? Figured it was time for a reunion.""

Pacifica huffed. ""I hate that you’re right.""

Dipper sighed and gestured to the seat across from him. ""Well… wanna sit down?""

Pacifica hesitated, then sighed. ""Might as well. Not like I can just walk out now."" She sat down, folding her arms. ""So. This is… weird.""

Dipper chuckled awkwardly. ""Yeah. Very weird.""

Stan, meanwhile, was enjoying the drama way too much. ""Hey, waitress! Bring me extra popcorn!""

""This is a diner, sir. We don’t serve popcorn.""

""Then bring me some buttered toast and I’ll pretend.""

Wendy snorted. ""Classic.""

Dipper, ignoring them, cleared his throat. ""So, uh… how’ve you been?""

Pacifica leaned back, tapping her fingers on the table. ""Well, I haven’t been chased by a demon triangle in the past decade, so I’d say I’m doing okay.""

Dipper chuckled. ""Yeah. Low bar, but understandable.""

She smirked. ""What about you? Finally stopped being a paranoid nerd?""

Dipper gasped dramatically. ""EXCUSE ME, I embrace my paranoia! It's what kept me alive in this town!""

Pacifica raised an eyebrow. ""Uh-huh. So what life-threatening conspiracy are you unraveling this time?""

Dipper hesitated. ""…I don't know yet, but I will find one.""

Pacifica shook her head. ""Ten years, and you’re still the same dork.""

Dipper grinned. ""You know you missed it.""

Pacifica scoffed. ""Pfft. As if."" But the slight smile on her face told a different story.

Stan leaned toward Wendy and whispered, ""Is it just me, or is there chemistry here?""

Wendy smirked. ""Oh, totally. I give ‘em a week before the awkward flirting starts.""

Stan chuckled. ""I give it a day.""

Pacifica suddenly turned to Wendy. ""By the way, why did you set this up?""

Wendy grinned. ""Because it’s hilarious.""

Pacifica groaned. ""I hate how well you know me.""

Dipper laughed. ""Welcome to my world.""

And just like that, the tension broke. The awkwardness faded into something more comfortable, more familiar.

I started drinking about 80oz per day over an 8 hour period and almost immediately noticed I felt MORE dehydrated and kind of crampy. I added a small amount of electrolytes to my water incase the increased water intake was flushing out my internal electrolytes, but it made no difference.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Taylor Fritz vs. Roberto Carballes Baena: A Foregone Conclusion with a Side of Frustration**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn—it’s time to dissect this ATP Canadian Open clash between Taylor Fritz and Roberto Carballes Baena. Let’s start with the numbers because, let’s be honest, Carballes Baena isn’t here to win… he’s here to make Fritz look like a *very* patient teacher grading a kindergartener’s algebra homework.

### Parsing the Odds: Fritz is the Human Equivalent of a “Free Two-For-One Coffee” Coupon

The odds make this as clear as a tennis ball hit into a swimming pool: **Taylor Fritz is the overwhelming favorite**. At BetMGM, Fritz is priced at **+106** (decimal: \~1.06), implying an absurd **\~94% implied probability** of victory. Carballes Baena, meanwhile, sits at **+875** (decimal: \~8.75), suggesting bookmakers give him less of a chance than a snowman in a sauna. Even the spread (-5.5 games for Fritz) and total (Under 19.5 games) suggest a straightforward, low-scoring affair—think of it as a tennis match where Fritz is playing against a wall that’s also napping.

### News Digest: Fritz is Pouty, Carballes Baena is “Here for the Vibe”

Taylor Fritz, the World No. 4, is coming off a solid run in Melbourne and a semifinal finish at the Citi Open. But let’s not forget his recent grumbling about the ATP’s “mandatory 500-event attendance policy,” which forced him to play when he’d rather be sipping coconut water on a beach. As he said, “I really could have used a rest week.” Translation: *“I’m a human being, not a Roomba that needs to vacuum every room in the house.”*

Carballes Baena, on the other hand, is th

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brandon Nakashima vs. Ethan Quinn: A Tale of Two Tennis Players (One of Them Just Isn’t Very Good Yet)**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mediocrity and Mastery**  
Brandon Nakashima enters this match as a near-70% favorite across bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around 1.4–1.45 (implied probability ≈ 69–70%). For Ethan Quinn, the underdog, odds sit at roughly 2.8–2.9 (implied probability ≈ 34–35%), meaning the books think he’s about as likely to win as I am to finally learn how to properly tie a tie. The spread favors Nakashima by -3.5 games, a line that screams “Quinn’s about to get schooled in a very public, very Canadian way.”

Historically, Nakashima has already beaten Quinn in straight sets at Washington, a result that feels less like a tennis match and more like a “Here’s your life, Ethan” moment. Nakashima’s experience—read: not crying in the third set—is a key edge. Quinn, meanwhile, has shown “impressive development this year,” which is tennis code for “he’s not terrible, but he’s not exactly Serena.”

**Digest the News: Injuries, Progress, and the Burden of Potential**  
No major injuries here, which is a relief. Nakashima’s game is as steady as a coffee shop in Manhattan—reliable, if a little overpriced. Quinn’s “development” this year is the sports equivalent of a sapling: promising, but don’t bet on it surviving a hurricane. The article also notes Quinn “has the potential to keep the match tight,” which is code for “he might win a set if Nakashima takes a 10-minute bathroom break.”

I recently started seeing someone who I met on a dating app, and we hit it off really well. We’ve been hanging out a lot lately, but it’s mostly just consisted of meeting at coffee shops, ice cream runs, playing video games, or watching shows together. We’ve both decided that we really want to actually go out and do some fun, more date-like activities together, but I’m struggling with what we could do that would be fun for both of us, as well as accessible. I’ve thought about the movies, the aquarium, maybe art museums, and there’s even a new claw arcade nearby that seems fun, so I suppose those could be good options. But does anyone have any other good options, or any tips for deciding on and navigating date spots? I want to make sure I’m not stressing out during a date about being symptomatic, but I also want him to enjoy himself with me!

We also both live about 1-2 hours from Disney and we’ve talked about going to their downtown/Disney Springs area, which I’d love, but it’s crazy hot in Florida right now so I’m concerned about that.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a clash that’s less “thrilling showdown” and more “statisticians showing off.” Andrey Rublev, the Russian hard-court wizard, steps onto the court as a near-92% favorite (per decimal odds of 1.09), while Hugo Gaston, the Frenchman who advanced after Mattia Bellucci’s retirement, is priced at 7.0-8.0—translating to a 12.5%-14.3% chance. If this were a math class, Gaston would be the “show your work” question, and Rublev would be the answer written in bold.

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Joke**  
Let’s break it down. Rublev’s implied probability of winning is so high, it’s like ordering a 12-ounce coffee and getting a 12-ounce *plus a side of confidence*. At 1.09, bookmakers are basically saying, “Bet on Rublev, but we’ll take 4% of your joy as a fee for being reasonable.” Gaston’s 8.0 odds, meanwhile, imply he’s here to make the match “sudden death” in the third set… of your betting bankroll.

The spread? Rublev is -5.5 games, which is like giving him a 5.5-game head start in a race where the finish line is “winning a tennis match.” The total games line sits at 19.5, suggesting this could be a tight three-setter—or a mercy rule if Rublev decides to play like the world No. 12 he is.

**Team News: When Retirement Isn’t a Metaphor**  
Hugo Gaston’s journey to this match reads like a LinkedIn post from a consultant: “Advanced to the next round via opponent’s retirement.” While Bellucci exited with… well, retirement, Gaston’s momentum is about as sturdy as a house of cards in a hurricane. He’s coming off a “free pass” and faces a Rublev who’s “moderately improved” from recent duds—a phrase that sounds less like a sports update and more li

For context I (28F) met Ausboy (27M) last 2019 he's a single dad living in Australia. He's always sliding into my DM that year and I always ignore it kasi may jowa sya that time.
Fast forward November 2023 we started casually chatting (nagreply ako kasi bored ako and I know wala syang jowa for 1+ year kasi were FB friends din. Started talking and video chatting nadin. We become close and he also introduced me with his child. Then December came he told me he loves me and things got serious between us (didn't said i love him back) i told him lets take it slow and see where it'll lead us (been single for 7yrs) by 2024 March - June i ghosted him kasi I found out na hes been talking with her Ex and after i confronted him about it naging sad boy sya and will call me in the middle of the night saying ""wag mokong susukuan ah"".

July came and i greeted him a happy birthday and promises me he'll go in the PH just to see me and his family. Ako kasi yung klase ng tao na I will not take you away sa family mo and be happy that you're spending time with them lalo na 5 years na syang hindi umuuwi ng PH. July 31 came and sabi nya sakin otw na sya sa airport and he told me he loves me. After 12 hrs of waiting nakita ko nagstory sya lo and behold kasama nya ex nya and he's in Disneyland. No msgs no nothing just a story of them together. I simply block him everywhere. That's my revenge.

Fast forward to December nagmsg sya using his childs account saying if we could meet up by 2025 kasi uuwi nga sya for a month. 2025 rolled in Ako naman tong tanga nakipagkita. We went to get coffee and talk very casually and point blank ask him bakit nya ginawa sakin yon. Ang sagot ng kupal ""wala kasi akong narinig na plan sayo regarding sa pag uwi ko parang wala kang balak makipagkita sakin"" tf told him my reasons and we went on our separate ways din. 
We're trying to fix things between us and then may nakita ako sa msg request ko a girl named Jan he told me that Ausboy is his boyfriend. Girl i said sorry right away 🥲 ewan ko but i check naman everywhere and wala talaga akong makita na jowa or nakakausap nya. Even talk to his dad and pinakilala nya akong girlfriend nya kahit hindi pa kami, even sa cousins nya. Then confronted him about her. He told me na nakafling nya yong girl, and the girl became super obsessive to the point na inistalk na sya.
Told the girl about it and things weren't adding up, mind you nabuntis nya si girl and she had a miscarriage 😭 Became super suspicious about the details he's been telling me. And found out na 5 kaming babae ang nakakausap nya. Ang galing ng time management ni Ausboy. The girl even sends me receipts about who he's been talking to and started making plans in my head. But first I confirmed sa girl when they started dating and she come around the time na MU kami ni Ausboy and she knew about me, but still continue. They broke up around August 2024 (kasi nga kasama nya ex nya sa DL)

Jan and I talk and told her that I am deeply sorry for causing her pain. She told me na lagi daw nila akong pinag aawayan kasi lagi nyang nakikita na inistalk ako ni Ausboy sa dummy account nya. We even became friends tbh. She has a pure heart for him. Felt sad kasi nagsesettle sya for less. Nabubugbog sya dndegrade pagkatao nya ni Ausboy. She sent me screenshots ng mga msgs nila. Naawa ako for her.

So here's my plan, told the girl to act like nothings happen. I will do the same din (like naniniwala ako sa reasonings ni Ausboy)

After work ni girl she went to Ausboy's house and she confronted her about me and naghinala si Ausboy agad kasi nakaearpods si girl(magkacall kami hehe), biglang naputol yung call then after a few minutes nagcall na ulit sya nagchat na ""bi nakatangal airpods ko off ko lang cam and mute ka lang ha"" then boom she asked him ""Be sino si *****"" sabi nung Ausboy ""ano yon msg ng msg sakin"" then bigla akong nag on cam sa FaceTime saying ""ohh talaga ba? Kakasabi mo lang kanina mahal moko bakit ngayon ganyan sinasabi mo?"" Then tawa ako ng tawa (yung tawa na nangnakakainsulto) ayun nabugbog si atekooo 😭 lalo sya nagalit kasi sumigaw ako ng ""oh wag mo syang sasaktan ha"" naawa ako for her kasi nakita ko pano sya pinagtulakan palabas ng bahay. She went home satisfied but i felt bad talaga kasi naranasan nya yon because of my plan after that I messaged Ausboy ""how does it feel? 😝"" then block him everywhere.

SORRY IF HINDI MAAYOS YUNG EXPLANATION KO

Life's good
Jan and I became friends din.

**Durable Construction:**

A high-quality stainless steel grinder is built to last. the grade of stainless steel used considerably impacts its durability and resistance to wear and tear. Look for grinders made from 304 or 316 stainless steel, known for their exceptional corrosion resistance and strength. This ensures that the grinder can withstand frequent use without succumbing to rust, scratches, or deformation. The thickness of the steel also plays a crucial role, with thicker steel providing better impact resistance and longevity.

**Precision Grinding Mechanism:**

the grinding mechanism is the heart of any grinder. Stainless steel burrs or blades must be precisely machined to deliver consistent and uniform grinding. Burr grinders, in particular, offer superior control over particle size, making them ideal for coffee enthusiasts who demand a specific grind consistency. Look for burrs that are hardened or coated to enhance their durability and sharpness. Equally spaced blades are designed for efficiency and speed.

**Ergonomic Design:**

The grinder should be cozy and easy to use. Ergonomic considerations include the shape and size of the grinder, the texture of the grip, and the smoothness of the grinding action. A well-designed grinder minimizes strain on your hands and wrists, particularly during prolonged use. Consider the ease of disassembling and reassembling the grinder for cleaning purposes. The presence of compartments to make gathering ingredients easier is a bonus.**Adjustable Grind Settings:**

Many stainless steel grinders offer adjustable grind settings, which allows you to customize the coarseness of the grind to suit your specific needs and preferences. This feature is particularly important for coffee grinders, where the grind size can significantly impact the taste and aroma of the beverage. Adjustable settings also make the grinder versatile for processing different types of ingredients, from fine powders to coarse flakes. Precise adjustment increments allow for finer control over the final product.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Stainless steel is relatively easy to clean and maintain, but the grinder's design can affect the ease of this process. Look for grinders with removable parts that can be easily rinsed or washed in the dishwasher. Avoid grinders with intricate crevices or hard-to-reach areas that can trap food particles or debris. Regular cleaning ensures optimal performance and hygiene. Always check manufacturer guidelines for recommended cleaning methods.

## Core Benefits

Stainless steel grinders offer several compelling benefits over grinders made from other materials. These advantages make them a popular choice for both professional and home use.

**Improved Grind Consistency:** The precision-engineered grinding mechanisms in high-quality stainless steel grinders ensure a consistent and uniform grind every time. This is particularly important for coffee and spice grinding, where uniform particle size is essential for optimal flavour extraction. Users report better-tasting coffee and more flavorful spices due to this consistency, enhancing their overall culinary experience. Grind consistency also ensures that no valuable ingredients go to waste.

**Enhanced Durability and Longevity:** Stainless steel is a highly durable material that can withstand years of use without showing signs of wear and tear.Stainless steel grinders are resistant to rust, corrosion, and staining, ensuring that they remain in excellent condition for an extended period. This translates to long-term cost savings compared to grinders made from cheaper materials that may need to be replaced more frequently. A well-maintained steel grinder will last a long time.

**Simplified Cleaning and Maintenance:** Stainless steel is easy to clean and maintain, making stainless steel grinders a hygienic choice. The smooth, non-porous surface of stainless steel resists the buildup of residue and bacteria, and it can be easily wiped clean with a damp cloth. Many stainless steel grinders also have removable parts that can be washed in the dishwasher, further simplifying the cleaning process. This convenient cleaning minimizes the time consumed on upkeep.

**Chemical inertness:** Unlike some other materials, stainless steel is chemically inert, meaning it won't react with the ingredients being ground. This prevents unwanted flavors or odors from being transferred to the spices,herbs,or coffee beans. Users can be confident that the flavor of their ingredients remains pure and unadulterated. Inert materials ensure safety when using a kitchen tool.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions and concerns to help the buyer.

**Are all stainless steel grinders dishwasher safe?**

Not all stainless steel grinders are dishwasher safe. While many are designed with dishwasher-safe components, it's crucial to consult the manufacturer's instructions before placing any parts in the dishwasher.Some grinders may have delicate parts that could be damaged by the heat and harsh detergents found in dishwashers. Hand washing with mild soap and water is often recommended for optimal longevity.

**How often should I clean my stainless steel grinder?**

The frequency of cleaning depends on how frequently the grinder is used and the types of ingredients being ground.For daily use, it's generally recommended to clean the grinder at least once a week. If used less frequently, cleaning every two to three weeks should suffice. Thoroughly cleaning the grinder after grinding oily or sticky ingredients is especially critically important to prevent residue buildup.**Can stainless steel grinders be used for both coffee and spices?**

While some stainless steel grinders are versatile enough to handle both coffee and spices,it's not always recommended to use the same grinder for both. Coffee beans tend to leave behind oils and residue that can affect the flavor of spices. Similarly, spices can impart their flavors onto coffee beans. If you plan to use the same grinder for both, be sure to thoroughly clean it between uses to minimize flavor transfer.

**What is the difference between blade and burr stainless steel grinders?**

Blade grinders use spinning blades to chop the ingredients, while burr grinders use two abrasive surfaces to grind the ingredients between them. Burr grinders provide more consistent and uniform grinding, allowing for better control over particle size. Blade grinders, on the other hand, tend to produce inconsistent results with a mixture of fine and coarse particles.Burr grinders are generally preferred for coffee, where consistent grind size is essential for optimal brewing.

The shrimp pasta was vibrant and beautifully presented. The shrimp were plump, fresh, and delicately cooked, topped with a slice of lime that added a refreshing citrus twist. The creamy sauce clung nicely to the linguine, offering a balanced flavor with hints of herbs and garlic. 

The coffee had a clean, straightforward character such as smooth body and a gentle roast bitterness. Served in a simple, elegant white cup, it was perfect for slowly sipping and enjoying the cafe’s peaceful atmosphere. A well-executed brew that complemented both savory and sweet pairings.

The soufflé pancake was visually stunning. Topped with a torched caramelized layer and garnished with mint, it was fluffy, custard-like. The rich yellow custard sauce was silky and fragrant, and the sides added both texture and flavor contrast. A delightful and unique dessert that paired well with the coffee😍",1,1753843663.0,u_5second10,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 😊

Ever had one of those “aha!” moments that made you go, “If I knew this back then, I’d be a freaking genius by now!”? I know I have, and it changed the game for me when it comes to focus. 

So, let’s talk about the lessons that have helped us zero in on what truly matters. Here’s mine: **“How to Work Smarter, Not Harder.”** 

I remember slogging through my to-do list like a zombie, coffee in hand, thinking I was being productive. Spoiler alert: I wasn’t. Here's what I learned that turned my focus levels up to 11:

- **Prioritize like a boss:** I used to tackle whatever popped up first. Now? I whip out my trusty list and ask, “What’s gonna move the needle?” If it’s not on the list, it might get pushed to next week's episode of *""Will I Ever Finish This?""*

- **Time blocking:** Blocking out time for specific tasks has been a game changer. It’s like scheduling a hot date with my productivity—and you better believe I show up. 📅 Set a timer, and when it buzzes, you can move on, guilt-free! 

- **Eliminating distractions:** Hello, social media! You beautiful, shiny distraction... I used to think I could just power through those notifications. Newsflash: I can’t. Now, I put my phone in another room while I work. Out of sight, out of mind, amirite? 

- **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, just do it NOW. Procrastination, who? ✌️ It’s like a mini win every time! 

- **Mindfulness breaks:** Looking back, I definitely underestimated the power of a quick breathing exercise or stretch. Who knew my brain needed a breather too? It's like I hit the refresh button on my focus! 

But let me ask you—what about YOU? What’s your “If I knew then…” moment that turned your focus from frenzied to fierce? Got any tips or funny stories about your journey?

It’s been solid, even on off days, and I’m curious about your go-to stacks or any tweaks I might be missing. Here’s what’s working for me:

•  Melatonin Microdose: 300mcg, or 600mcg if I’m up past midnight. Keeps it close to natural levels to avoid grogginess.

•  Magnesium + Glycine: Magnesium glycinate plus 2-3g glycine during the day or early evening. Glycine seems to boost deeper sleep and recovery.

•  If I drink coffee too late, I take 25mg CBD to help restore REM. It smooths out the disruption.

•  Rough Day Backup: After a bad workout or a social drink, I use 200mg of an herbal blend (valerian root, chamomile, lemon balm, passionflower). These seem to keep deep and REM strong, even on shorter nights.

Sex: Male  
Diagnosis: ADHD  
Medications: I used to take adderall not anymore\*  
Supplements: Creatine Monohydrate, Omega-3, Recently ashwagandha, 2x 2mg nicotine pouch, 1 cup of coffee in the morning.  
Health: I am very fit, I eat very healthy, and I rarely drink  
Background: just graduated college with two degrees, and I just started my new job.

I want to ask for advice on weather this is just anxiety or of i should go see a doctor about this. Over the last month I have started to feel very tired and unmotivated, and then one day I felt as if i couldn't speak or remember anything, its as if my mind went blank so I started to panic because I thought I was having a stroke. I went to the ER and they did blood work, EKG test, blood pressure test, and some basic physical test (such as testing sensitivity around my body). They said I had nothing to worry about and they prescribed me hydroxyzine for anxiety relief. Over the next couple of weeks I decided to quit nicotine and I convinced myself that any of the negative symptoms I was feeling such as brain fog, loss of balance, changes in mood were all nicotine withdrawals. My symptoms seemed to have calmed down a bit until I started my new office job. Recently I have started to feel the same symptoms, and some new ones, such as brain fog, slurred speech, loss of balance, weakness, blurry vision, and a tingling sensation in my right arm when I try to fall asleep. I have been hypervigilant over my symptoms and I could be having a case of health anxiety.

My family is telling me that its all in my head and that I just need to stop worrying about it. I understand why they think that but I honestly feel as if something is wrong with me, and I want to know if anxiety could be the reason I am feeling these symptoms, or if perhaps I should get a neurological examination. I have been researching my symptoms and parkinsons, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and brain damage all keep appearing. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

\*Side note on adderall: I seldomly took any, at the height of me using it I used it for two weeks straight (10mg XR), perhaps this messed up my prefrontal cortex?

1mcv593,https://i.redd.it/7ua7i4hz4xff1.jpeg,Daughter,"I slowly paced back and forth through the upper apartment of the entire home we were renting from an unsavory landlord. Despite his searching for answers to his life's problems at the bottom of a bottle, he cobbled together a two story home which gave safe harbor to my quaint family.

My daughter, Rose, was finally fast asleep, gripping my loose white tee shirt. I sighed quietly with relief, as this was not the first night we had trouble putting her down for extended sleep.

Rose had just hit the milestone of seven months old, by now she was able to provide much needed sleep for myself and her mother by not requiring feeding every two hours. For the first few days as a seven month old, she was as precious as could be, wistfully snoring away the moonlit hours with no crying or fussing, allowing some hard earned rest to her parents. While I could function off of five hours minimum, my wife struggled more with the lack of sleep. I did right by my wife, offering endless support. It was the least I could do after she pushed our eight pound seven ounce miracle free from her 'guttyworks'.

It was an interesting time being a parent, I couldn't help but smile as I sat on our sectional couch in the living room, finally allowing my eyes to close for the night, my daughter safely deposited into her crib. No sooner did I relax, did a frightful cacophonous wailing echo throughout our apartment.

Bolting upright, I quickly strode into my daughters room, opening the door gently as I possibly could to minimize any distress the poor child was dealing with. Despite the incessant wailing, Rose calmly slept. Her mouth did not move, nor did she have any expression of pain across her cherub face. She looked warm, comfortable, and altogether unbothered by the situation. I rested my hand upon her crib that I built myself staring at her muffled movements in the darkness of her room.

As my sleepy parent brain adjusted, I could still hear the crying, though it was coming from another part of the upstairs floor. I crept around slowly, as my wife was still fast asleep in bed, only to find our black cat, Felony, wide awake and sitting at the sliding glass door to our back deck. Her tail twitched, and brushed the cold linoleum as her ears perked up at the increasingly distressing wailing.

It sounded just like Rose on her worst day, if she absolutely wasn't having it. Walking up to Felony, I scratched her backside. She calmly turned her emerald eyes toward my beleaguered face and let out a quiet meow, as if whispering to me to not disturb whatever was making that terrible racket.

Sitting on the cold linoleum floor, staring out at the night sky offered me some perspective. Though the crying was worse from this part of the house, it appeared as though it was coming from below our deck. I checked my smart watch. The ruddy cheeks and baggy eyes of mine formed a strange reflection overlapping with *Mickey Mouse*'s whimsical eternal smile from the sixties. The digital clock read 4:08AM.

I opened the glass door to the back porch and stepped outside, with Felony in tow.

""Call Clyde."" I whispered into my smart watch. The silent vibrato buzzed in the quiet dawn of the not-yet-morning.

""Mikey."" The voice responded, awake, as I thought he would be. 

""Hey, I just put Rose down, do you think you can-""

""I'm so sorry, son. I gotta get better at this."" His quick apology assured my suspicions. Clyde, my wife's father, had been living below us for the better part of a decade, helping our small family grow and help us pay the cost of rent to the building. The old-timer was good for money, and loved Rose, as she was the first legitimate grand-child he was ever able to hold in his arms. Clyde had a proclivity for all kinds of action and horror movies, habitually watching them at a volume wholly reserved for *AC/DC* concerts. Aside from that one quirk, he was a stellar father-in-law, and did right by us.

""Thanks man, I'll get you a coffee tomorrow.""

""Appreciate it, kiddo. Welcome to raising children.""

""How am I doing so far?"" I asked, knowing he'd be straight with me.

""Better than most. I'll let you get some sleep."" With that, he disconnected the call. I sighed and went back into the house. The caterwauling had stopped, and Felony was uninterested in the sliding glass door. I gave her some treats, as a reward for helping me solve the mystery of the wailing baby. I then got comfortable on our sectional couch, and fell fast asleep.

Four hours later with coffee in hand, I knocked on the lower door to our house. Clyde groggily opened the door and scratched the two caterpillars on his face he called eyebrows.

""Here."" He swiped at his mug, but I pulled back letting him suffer for a moment. ""I don't want to be a bother but the headphones we gave you last Christmas, how come you don't use those?"" I then handed him his coffee, which he graciously accepted.

""They aren't loud enough."" He took a swig of the morning brown and waggled an eyebrow. ""I mean, well, they broke.""

""How did they break?"" The cost wasn't the issue, we could easily get him another pair, but it was upsetting that a man so good with older technology could scarcely keep a pair of analog headphones in good condition.

""Tried to turn them to max volume, with that little wheel do-hickey. It snapped and broke the volume control. I can't get any sound in them anymore. Sorry."" He looked downcast. I suddenly felt as if I had kicked a small puppy. I relented.

""Well, alright man. Just, no more late night horror movies anymore. That wailing was terrible."" I paused when he furrowed his brow in confusion. ""What?""

""Mikey, I was watching *Casablanca.*""

""Good one."" I wasn't a fan of the classics, but there was no way in hell a crying baby was in *Casablanca*.

""No, seriously. Look."" Clyde beckoned me into his neatly kept apartment. He had an expansive collection of physical movies and multiple combination DVD & Blu-Ray players. The prize of his collection was a vintage *Sony* SL8000 Beta-max player. It rarely saw use, but sat atop a pedestal closely among the VHS devices that absolutely dominated the market at the time.

On his coffee table, with his pack of cigarettes and a drained glass of bourbon, still sitting next to a mostly full bottle, was the VHS copy of *Casablanca*. The tape that rested in the sleeve had been inserted into the fourth most available VCR closest to one of his old tube television sets that he utilized for the *experience*.

""Refresh my memory, do any babies cry in that movie?"" Maybe I was wrong. Maybe when Humphrey Bogart said *'Here's looking at you, kid.'* It could have been possible that his delivery, although perfect, would have upset a baby nearby.

""Mikey, you're a new parent. This is the first time you and Angela have ever done something like this. Look, go to work. I'm off today so I can take Angie and Rosie out for some dinner and you can catch up on some sleep when you get home."" I nodded along to his prattling. I knew what I heard last night, I didn't think it was some fluke. Even Felony heard something. But I figured Clyde was right. I just wanted to be a good dad. This opportunity of fatherhood was something that had happened once before, but was ripped away from me.

""Yeah, okay. You're right. Thanks.""

""We're family. You're a good dad. Even the best of dads need a break now and again."" Clyde clapped me on the shoulder, and I left for work.

I couldn't focus a lot on my tasks that day. The mundane office job I had was better than most. Free coffee, a gym across the hall, lots of downtime between calls on the weekends. Something kept digging at me. Clyde called me a good dad, but I'm sure he wouldn't if he knew some of the earlier choices I made in life.

I was sweet on his Angela. The anatomy of our love blossomed when I first met her at Church. Angie and I had been in love for a few years, and I took it slow. But before Angie, there was Veronica. She was the first woman I had married. It was a different love than Angie. Angie was safe, and she had a good work ethic. She wasn't about taking risks, nor was she unpleasant to be around. She had a beautiful smile and was traditional in all aspects of home-keeping. I had to fight her just to do chores around the house. But Veronica, she was something else entirely.

Veronica oozed freedom. She was an untamed mythical eagle forever soaring among the clouds, this woman could turn any mundane encounter into an adventure. She lived fast, and hard, and loved just as equally. When I had proposed to her all those years ago, I was sure she'd laugh in my face. But she surprised me.

""Okay lover-boy. Make me yours."" She was the Mary-Jane to my Peter Parker.

Everything she did was crazy, and I was just happy to be along for the ride. She was full of beautiful life, and vim, until she we got pregnant. Veronica changed completely. 

Around her friends she was still this legend among legends, but she slowly turned insular. No longer did she feel like going out, or doing the fun things we did. She wasn't about drinking, or drugs or partying that way, but you can be damned sure she would be the first at the front of the concert venue, dancing like crazy to whatever songs were on the playlist.

At twenty weeks, when we found out it was going to be a girl. Veronica snapped. She practically shoved her denim skirt back down and pushed the ultrasound tech to the ground. I hastily apologized while I chased after my then pregnant wife. She got in the driver's seat of our mustang and glared daggers at me as I got in.

""I can't do girls Mikey. Nuh-uh, no way."" She was upset, and now had been venting, driving erratically across the back roads that wove through the dense forests which would take us back home. Her eyes were tear stained, and she would constantly take her hand off the wheel to rub away the rogue tears streaming down her face. Though I hated it, she still smoked small puffs of cigarettes, but when she was livid the long drag of nicotine was the only master that could tame her foul temper. Veronica would let go of the wheel to rummage for her cigarettes and light one, puffing like a dragon as she floored the gas.

""Why not? I thought you'd be thrilled. You'd make the coolest mom I'd ever know."" The compliment was lost on her. I hold onto the *whoa fuck* handle in the passenger seat, regretting not pulling her out of the drivers seat.

""No way. My mom was a cunt, she treated me like shit, like I was nothing."" Tears streamed down her face.

""That doesn't mean you'd treat our little girl like that. It's a blessing babe, how good will it feel to be an even better mother then your mom?"" I never would get anything further from Veronica as it was destined a tree would fall in our path. As her one hand was free wiping away her tears, she overcompensated with the other, lurching the car over the cliff down into the forest below.

I don't remember much of what happened during the rolling of our car, but I remember being thrown quite a distance. When I woke from the delirium, what I saw would be etched into my memory forever.

Veronica was dead, her neck snapped and bent at an odd angle. Her eyes and mouth were permanently in a surprised expression, as the vertebrae of her spine stuck out from her neck, without breaking skin. There seemed to be an internal pooling of blood from the odd angle of her neck. The bulging H.R. Geiger nightmare gawped from broken branches at me like the eye of Satan.

Though it was assuredly broken, it looked like a pimple yet to pop, as the swelling red liquid rose to the point that just couldn't penetrate her skin. Something must have detached from the car, as her belly was split wide open. The morbid cesarean performed on her by what was likely car or tree shrapnel was horrific.

Her lower intestine had sagged somewhat, and the umbilical cord complete with what was still my developing daughter rested just below on the ground. Our unborn daughter who was still attached to the mother quivered in the cold.

I stood stock still, shocked at the carnage that lay before me. I could only stare at the underdeveloped infant that was my unnamed daughter as it struggled to survive. Overcome by the accident, and bleeding from my head, I didn't know what to do. The poor child, not yet made for this earth expired, it's little lungs unable to suck air or cry. The horrible noise it made as it took its last breaths on this plane of existence were mucus filled cries, not loud enough to be anything considered human, but they would haunt me to this day.

At the time, all I could do was weep. I took the discarded remains of our child and placed it further ahead in the woods, hastily burying it with leaves and twigs. Her glassy eyes looked at me from beyond the veil. I don't know if it was shame on that small face that glared at me, or it was upset at its circumstance. It was the best I could do at the time. I later lied to the paramedics who arrived on scene upon me calling for assistance and said I had been out for some time. I made a great effort to hide my tracks to our unnamed baby's grave, I didn't want to ever relive the memory of the alien creature of my wife's insides, warbling as it died. When all was said in done, I was in the hospital by 4:08pm.

The guilt would still bubble over sometimes as I held Rose tight to my chest. I lamented the life un-lived from my first child, the one that would never be.

""Mikey, you okay?"" Snapping out of my haze, from the fluorescent lights of the call center, I turned to see one of the other team leads waving a hand in my face. ""Getting enough sleep there, bud?""

""Yeah, sorry. Parenthood is tough. This is you in three weeks Michelle, though I figure since you're growing the child you'll probably more tired."" She smiled and rubbed her belly to my response.

""Yeah, I start my maternity leave tomorrow. I'm excited. Rick keeps asking how you've been doing and I tell him you look tired each and every day. He said he's gonna take some paternal leave to help me for the first little bit.""

""I advocate for that. I would take more if I could, to be honest. Tell him to take two months, not one.""

""I will, thanks. Hey, it's not super busy, I can cover for you if you wanna go home?"" She didn't have to ask me twice, I clocked out from my desk and gave her a hug. She waved me out of the office and I left to the security guard telling me to get some rest.

The drive home was four minutes and eight seconds. I was still groggy by the time I climbed the stairs and unlocked the door. Angie was still home, and Rose was in good spirits. I mumbled to her one word; 'sleep' and passed out on the couch. I could hear Rose babbling happily and in the ether of my dreams, eventually I heard the front door open and then close.

The smell of pizza woke me out of my coma. I found a note on the box:

*Triple cheese, just as you like it. We're out for dinner. My dad said you needed a night off, and Rose needs to learn about restaurants. Plus I'm excited for the 'kids under three eat free' deal. We'll be home later.*

*Love, Angie*

The first bite of the slightly cold, but still incredibly greasy pizza uplifted my spirits. I cried a single tear of joy that my creature comforts were still looked after by my wife. Angie was certainly a lover more true than the sun, gifted by Christ himself. My father once told me that marriage is split sixty-forty. The trick of the split is that both halves of the partnership were always trying to be the sixty in that split. 

The bliss I felt, did not last long as Felony suddenly darted towards the back of the apartment, and sat stock still at Rose's bedroom door.

I heard a muffled cry from her bedroom.

My heart leapt into my chest. I re-read the note Angie had left me. ""*Rose needs to learn about restaurants.*"" Clearly Rose wasn't here. This certainly wasn't a restaurant.

What the fuck.

What was making that God-awful noise?

I sent Angie a text: *Rose is with you, right?* It was a stupid question, obviously, but I had to be sure. I didn't get a response right away so I slowly began the long walk to the back room. Every crease in the floorboards and creak from my weight caused me great unease.

What was happening?

What am I walking into?

Why is it upset?

What *is* it?

More questions raced through my mind as I slowly opened the door to the bedroom. I didn't turn on the light. The only ambient lighting that shone through the curtains was the setting sun. The crying continued, though it wasn't as loud as it was before. Felony suddenly stood up, her hackles raised as she made a low hiss, not wanting to step a single one of her paws into the room.

""It's okay girl, shh. I'll be okay."" I didn't truly know if I would be. Felony stood her ground, but walked no further. The dread of stepping closer to whatever was making the noise made my heart hammer loudly in my chest. As I took a single step into the room, my phone vibrated. The crying continued, this time louder.

Slowly, I read the message, now horrified at what I might find.

*Rose is here with me and my dad.* Attached was a picture of my beautiful daughter with spaghetti sauce on her porcelain features. I looked into the crib which had a lumpy figure moving within the blanket. I tried to rationalize what it was that was wailing so maliciously. Taking a breath, removing the blanket, I fell back screaming in sheer terror.

Veronica's baby, my other daughter, had found its way to me.

The umbilical cord clung to the child and its stout features. Its skin, her skin, was mottled and red. Though she would have been twenty weeks old at the time, whatever epidermis that would have been forming gave a sinewy appearance, was battered by an unkempt forest floor. Dried leaves and mud were spattered on the creature. It had two overlarge glassy eyes, that had a yellowed appearance in the sclera. She lacked a nose, but instead had a pushed in slit and cleft palate where the nose should be. The horror of her mouth had two sets of sharpened teeth on the top and bottom, and the mouth opened at a grimace that would be impossible for a regular baby. The shape of the horror could almost be described as avian.

This undulating creature from my personal hell, climbed over the edge, and lowered itself to the floor. I scrambled back more, back toward the doorway, but hit the corner of the door frame, hurting myself in the process. With every movement it made, a feeble step, or it crawling trying to stand, and fail, on unformed legs with no joints to support it, an ungodly squelching noise came with it. It would hoist itself up on its two legs, and then fall forward clumsily on its hands. With every failed attempt to stand and walk, it shrieked in agony. As it inched ever closer to me, I could see a prehensile tongue flick out, much like a crawling lizard, wafting through the air, trying to determine where I was.

The terrible howl continued, Felony raising her own into the fray. The orchestra of madness reached its zenith, when courage finally found me.

I flicked on the bedroom light.

Gone was the totality of darkness, the room now bathed in a comforting light.

The creature, my unborn child, that terrible *thing,* was no longer there.

Any viscera it had left in both the bassinet, or the floor of Rose's room was gone. Felony and I both were confused, and still rattled from the experience.

""You saw that too girl?"" The emerald green eyes of my cat gave me a knowing look.

My phone was vibrating. Six missed calls from Angie. What was perhaps only a minute was in actuality half an hour. I immediately called her back as I searched Rose's room for the malfeasance that lingered within it.

""Michael, are you okay?"" She was stern, using her motherly voice. Angie only ever called me Michael when she was with Rose.

""A little rattled. I got some sleep but had a terrible nightmare.""

""You don't sound so good, pizza was a bad call?""

""No hon, pizza is great. Listen-"" I could hear movement in the living room. I lurched my body out and could see Felony playing with one of her toys. Her temperament was solid, so I felt safe for the moment. ""I have to go for a bit of a drive, I gotta go up north about an hour to the other call center, since I left early they wanted me to head over and check on some things with the new employees."" It was a shitty lie, but I needed something.

""This late at night?"" My wife saw through it immediately.

""Yeah, it's *because* I left early that they're making me do it. The other team leads that could be available don't have access to a car, I'm the only one that does."" I fucking sucked at lying.

""Well, alright then. Hey, save some pizza for Rose. I wanna give her a small bite to see what she thinks.""

""I only had a single slice before falling back asleep, there's plenty left.""

""Okay, say bye to daddy Rosie!"" Angie put the phone up to rose on speaker. I could hear the beautiful babbling of my living daughter. I wept, the beauty of my living child and her cooing voice comforted me. 

""Bye honey, daddy will be home late tonight! Be good for your mom!"" We said our goodbyes, and I silently prayed for Rose.

I couldn't let this thing near her.

Something had to be done.

I cursed the weather, as it grew tumultuous on the drive toward her resting place. A rainfall began no sooner did I leave my apartment. I said a possible final goodbye to Felony, and left a note for Angela. I admitted everything, told her about Veronica, of who she knew, but also the unborn daughter of whom I buried hastily, that she did not know about.

The image still vexed me, the unborn girl who was never meant to be. Though I didn't hear her cries as I drove, the thunder-crash and lightning gave all the pageantry of her misery. I couldn't be certain that my plan would work, though I had to try. 

In my hasty preparation on my way to the end at the beginning, I searched the internet for curses. Any sort of malignant power, anything related to harm done to children. Aside from the biblical threat from Jesus Christ Himself warning me of the fate of gnashing teeth and great weeping I would receive for my transgressions I found a single hit.

Poroniec.

The word was Slavic in origin, and belonged to a subset of Scandanavian folklore that related to the mistreatment of unbirthed children. I didn't know what *she* was, but she certainly had been mistreated all those years ago.

I would give her a proper burial, hopefully appeasing her.

Eventually, I reached the same hairpin turn which once held a fallen tree. Though it was a few years since our crash, I could still see area of the forest the mustang had ruined. There was an overgrowth, but nothing I couldn't navigate. I had a flashlight clipped to my hi visibility overcoat, as well as reflective tape to help mark my passageway back to my car.

Before I could make my way down the precarious embankment toward my destination, a horrible screech of tires and crash of metal interrupted any thoughts I had. Though I believed I had pulled over far enough, the rain caused visibility to be poor, and as such a tractor trailer slammed into my car. The resulting aftershock launched me over the guard rail, and I tumbled headfirst into a thicket of darkness.

A familiar sensation overtook me as I fell. I could see the past as it had happened, I felt all the rolls of the mustang I was once in match this future that I had yet to experience. I could see Veronica, panicking in the car, holding onto her belly. Despite all things I had believed, it relieved me to see her in her last moments show love to the child we could have had. I felt my body strike something with a wet *thud* and I passed out.

I woke, an unknown amount of time later. The rain was still falling, though not as harshly. I sucked wind and checked my body for injuries. My ankle was twisted completely around, the pain was indescribable. Like one thousand tiny knives all cut it at once, from every angle. I checked my flashlight, relieved to see it still worked. Through the murky bramble of wet and autumn leaves, I was shocked to see the site of our crash.

I wasn't sure if I should thank God or curse Him.

I stood, weakly, looking for a branch to help support my weight, luckily there were thick enough sticks I could cobble together a makeshift crutch. Hobbling my way to where I had buried her, or at least where I thought I had buried her, I could see a disturbance in the ground.

It had been years, but I was prepared in the event wildlife had got to her. Digging up the hastily dug grave I once had created for her, I found small lumps of viscera which I assumed to be remnants of my little girl. I cried, thinking of Rose. What a fate that could have been hers. Would I bury her like this too? How could I have been so uncaring?

The task at hand, with pain and blood slowly ebbing from my wounded ankle, I resolved to make things right. I took whatever discarded rotted lumps of meat that were within the hole and wrapped them from a piece of my garment. I reburied them and used two sticks to mark the grave site. I prayed the Lord's Prayer, weeping through the verses. My breathing had become ragged. I removed the flashlight from my coat and re-examined myself. I could feel a piercing pain in my abdomen, as the rain still fell, it was hard to see what was wrong, but I wasn't sure I would have much more time to do what needed to be done. I finished the grave, scrawling her name into the cross of sticks. My ruined fingernails and broken body finally sighed as I finished with her name.

*Anna*.

My work was completed. I leaned back, against the closest tree to the grave. Terror overcame me again as the same putrescent creature in Rose's bed crawled from just beyond the gloom in the forest. It was still frightfully deformed, and repulsive to look at. The rain pinging against its broken body made it shudder. For the first time since I laid eyes upon the creature, I felt pity. What sort of father could leave his daughter alone, in such a condition. I swallowed, tears welling up in my eyes.

""Anna. Come here, come sit with your father."" If it could be called a 'smile' the multiple rows of teeth all at once twisted into a childlike grin. It didn't hurry toward me, but crawled with a hastened speed. The smell of it was unbearable, the rotted flesh of a carcass mixed with spoiled meat. The prehensile tongue came out and licked one of the glassy yellow eyes, bulging from its horrible face. The crying began to disappear. A strange cooing noise emerged from the creature, from Anna. No longer was I plagued by its caterwauling. My heart felt at ease, and my body less heavy.

""I did you wrong Anna, but no more. I've marked where I left you, and I've named you. I will always love you, just as much as Rose. I did this for her, and for you."" I wasn't sure if she could understand me, but the unsettling fetal monstrosity looked and listened to what I had to say. If it could comprehend me, I hoped that my words reached it. I felt as though I was forgiven. The mottled beast, my unborn daughter Anna, closed its murky eyes and began to snore, near the wound in my abdomen.

""I'm sorry."" Was the last thing I said, as I stroked her coarse skin atop her head. Soon, everything went dark, and I fell away into a void.

They found me a day later, half starved and bleeding out. This was due to the letter I left my wife. I don't recall many questions, though I was in no condition to answer any of them. I believe one of the responding EMT's asked me *'Who's Anna?'.* I just laughed. 

Couldn't he see? 

I was later committed, as I felt I was thoroughly unwell. It was mostly my choice, which Angie and Clyde respected. I told them about what I had experienced.

They didn't believe me. Not many did.

They still visited me regularly, Angie remarried after a few years. Rose grew into a fine young woman, and she still called me dad. I told her to be mindful of her mother, and listen to her step-father. Rose would tell me all about her school, her grades, boys she liked. It was a sense of normalcy, though nothing could ever truly be normal again. Her sister was often upset that I never introduced her, but I told her time and time again Rose wasn't ready yet. 

Clyde would visit from time to time. He looked at me as though I was a caged animal. Despite his wariness, Clyde listened to what I had to say and believed me when I told him about Anna.

He asked me what Anna looked like. 

I had attempted to draw her once, from my memory, foggy as it was. Every time I put pen to paper the image wouldn't look quite right. The doctors who had approved my drawings deemed me unfit for re-entry. I soon stopped trying to explain what I could see, or who was there if only to be left alone to my own devices.

But Anna was with me. Her many rows of teeth and mottled skin. Her beautiful glassy eyes and prehensile tongue, which would affectionately bathe me in kisses whenever I returned to my cot, in the room I was allowed. She was a good girl, I was glad that I had her. Her angelic wings would spread out and cover us while we napped together.

I loved her, and rocked her to sleep nightly, ensuring she never cried again.

My precious daughter.

My little angel, Anna.

1mcv2bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1mcv2bn/aita_for_crashing_at_a_friends_place_after_a/,AITA for crashing at a friend’s place after a fight with my boyfriend over an Instagram story?,"

Hi. I’m Evan (22, TM). This is the first time I’m posting on Reddit since I got on the app a week ago. I’m feeling really guilty and confused right now I need some advice/opinions. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend, Julian (28M), for 8 months, and he’s honestly amazing most of the time. I’m pretty new to serious relationships, and sometimes I worry I’m not good enough for him. Last night, we had a fight, and I ended up leaving his place to stay with a friend. I feel like I overreacted, but I’m also kinda hurt, and I need help figuring out if I’m the asshole here.

So, a bit about us: I’m a part-time barista and studying graphic design at community college. I’m still figuring out life as a trans guy, and Julian’s been super supportive and a loving boyfriend. Sometimes he evens offers to help cover my T costs when I’m strapped for cash or checking in to make sure I’m okay. He’s charming, has a solid marketing job, and he’s always caring, always planning cute dates or making sure I’m eating when I’m stressed out. But sometimes he gets… overly protective? Like, he’ll ask a ton of questions about who I’m with, where I’m going or say things like, “I just want you to be safe/you’re too trusting.” At first, I thought it was sweet, but lately, it feels a bit overbearing, like I can’t move without him needing to know.

Anyway the fight happened two days ago and happened was: I posted an instagram story of me grabbing coffee with my friend Bruno (24M), who’s also my ex from a couple years ago(we dated briefly for a year ish and now we’re just friends who catch up sometimes) My insta story was literally just us holding coffee cups and I captioned it “caffeine catch-up.” which I thought was totally harmless but apparently it wasn’t. 

Julian saw it and got quiet, which is his thing when he’s upset and I’ve gotten used to it. Then later, he asked why I didn’t tell him I was meeting Bruno. I said it was just coffee there was no big deal, but he said it “looks bad” to post with an ex and that I should’ve checked with him first. He wasn’t yelling or anything but he was super serious saying stuff like, “I trust you, but you don’t get how this comes off to other people.” and then I got defensive because it’s literally MY instagram and I wasn’t hiding anything and he had nothing to worry about. 

But things got heated. I told Julian he was overreacting, and he said I was being naive, that posting the story made him feel disrespected. He insisted I take it down and unfollow Bruno’s account. His voice got loud, almost aggressive, which threw me off, but then he softened and said it’d “mean a lot” if I did it. I felt so trapped that I unfollowed Bruno(which I totally regret now because I only did it under pressure) but when he kept pushing me to delete the story too, sounding more frustrated, I dug in and said no, I wasn’t taking it down. I told him we both needed space to cool off, or this fight was just going to spiral. We were both pretty worked up, so I grabbed my backpack and left to crash at my friend Sam’s place (23F, we met in art class). I didn’t tell Julian where I was going because I was still kinda pissed and just needed to think. Now I feel so dumb for being so dramatic, but I was just so overwhelmed in the moment.

Now it’s 3AM I’ve been ignoring his texts but he texted me an apologies saying he didn’t mean to upset me and that he was just jealous because he cares so much about me. He said he’s cool with me hanging with Bruno but wishes I’d be more “open” about my plans so he doesn’t feel left out. He even sent a voice note saying he misses me and wants to talk when I’m ready. Now I’m wondering if I made a big deal out of nothing…. 

The thing is he is older and has more relationship experience so maybe I was the one being thoughtless?? I still love him of course and he’s usually so great, but sometimes I feel like he has these barriers that he puts up and he comes off as overprotective. I haven’t gone back to his place yet, and the story’s not up anymore because I eventually chose to delete it the more I felt guilty and bad about it. Anyways I’m so sorry if this is long to read but that’s all

AITA?  I feel so bad for making him worry, but I also feel weird about the whole thing idk what to do. Any advice is allowed.",0,1753843133.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,11,0.25,False

If you work in the food industry (literally can be anything with food. Coffee shop, waitress, cook, fast food etc.) please recommend me a book! 

Can be about anything, doesn't have to be food related, but i love sci-fi, horror and dystopian the most.

I don't really have a budget in mind for this one, I'm assuming less than a grand for the plumbing (hopefully), I'm just south of the river in Perth. I have a 2 bowl kitchen sink that has the usual pipework underneath. I'd like to have a plumber split the waste underneath into a 3 part waste and to split the hot and cold water to make a coffee station in my lounge room in a built in cabinet (I'll build the cabinetry). I have this drawing of what I'm kind of looking for. My question is, is this allowed/ would this be okay/how much would this actually cost?
