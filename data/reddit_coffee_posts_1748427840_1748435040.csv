But my boyfriend loves coffee. For too long I have watched him suffer at the hands of own-brand instant coffee, which is fine for a rush-out-the-door-to-work brew, but I see him longing for something more on the weekends. Now we have a very small kitchen and we're on a budget as we're trying to save for a house, so he'd go mad if I bought something pricey. But I've settled on getting him the Stilosa Espresso Coffee Machine as a birthday treat. However, I need to know what coffee to get him to go with it. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated please. I'm not even sure what type of coffee it requires. Want to avoid pods though for expense/environmental reasons. Also, budget is unknown just depends what's best - only put that in due to posting rules. TIA :)",1,1748434874.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1kxfmre,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxfmre,The Superlatives of Dancing with the Stars (Novelty Rounds) : Round 27 – Most Under-rated Winner | Top Comment Wins!,"*No “****BONES****” about it.*        

Bobby Bones, winner of Season 27, wins the category of *Worst winner*.  
In other, equally as shocking news, water is wet.

Whilst Bobby does not have the lowest competitive average for dances (that honour belongs to Kelly Monaco from Season 1 if you do not take into account her Season 15 performances), his lower quality of dance and limited improvement, combined with his sh\*tty attitude, solidified his place here. He won over the likes of Milo, Evanna, Alexis, Juan Pablo, Tinashe… His *Greatest Showman* freestyle is so stupid. I maintain that the reason the “Judges Save” was introduced was to prevent a winner like Bobby from winning again.

There were no other nominations for this category.

Both our winners of categories so far were male winners.  
I wonder if a female will win either of the last two remaining rounds.

We are voting for *Most under-rated winner* today – our second last vote of the game. Winners can be deemed under-rated for a variety of reasons – They scored well but weren’t really impactful, they overshadowed by another finalist, they were from an overall weaker season, the list goes on. Along with your nominations, please list your reasonings – they definitely help people see your perspectives!!

I am in Australia and have stayed up past my normal bed time in the hopes that u/jdessy may be awake to put their nominations in after they were unable to share their impassioned view on Candace’s Contemporary. I hope you see this just as you’re having your morning coffee 😊

I had a thought today - after this category is finished, how would you all feel about doing one **final** vote for BEST, WORST, UNDER-RATED and OVER-RATED **DANCE**... Out of all the winners of each of these categories. It might be fun to put Giles' Argentine Tango against Charli's Foxtrot, Sabrina's Cha-Cha-Cha etc and see which one comes out on top for best, and the same with the other three categories. If that sounds fun, I will run the game for an extra four days. If not, I am happy to end it after this round ends. 

Happy voting!",2,1748434786.0,dancingwiththestars,1,1.0,False
1kxfmf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1kxfmf5/everyones_a_builder_now_how_2_product_guys_build/,Everyone’s a Builder Now: How 2 product guys build our webapp MVP with $300 in 6 weeks,"Six months ago, we were stuck. Not for lack of ideas, but for lack of leverage.

My cofounder and I had a problem we'd been discussing for a while: travelers want better recommendations. Not SEO-choked listicles. Not fake influencer recommendations. Real, local insight. Something raw and trustworthy that helps you experience a city like you're with a friend who lives there.

We went the old-school route first. We built a very low-fidelity prototype: literally a Google Maps list with 100 places in Bangkok we peronally recommended. We weren’t trying to build tech yet, we just wanted to validate one thing: do these kinds of recs resonate?

They did. People loved the vibe. The tone. The type of spots. We got DMs saying things like “Used your list 3x last night to great success. Best night I've had yet!”

But here’s the thing—it didn’t feel like a step-change in how people travel. We weren’t changing how people explore a city, just giving them a better list. We were stuck, with hard decisions. We’re product folks, we had a vision, but we're not devs. We considered:

* Should we raise a pre-seed round?
* Should we hunt for a technical cofounder?
* Should we hire an agency to prototype something?

Every option was not ideal... Then AI tooling blew up, and [Bolt.new](http://Bolt.new) came onto our radar. Instead of writing docs and waiting, we jumped on the “vibe code” train.

Three days. Three Bolt accounts. Lots of coffee. And we had it: a working version of our core vision. It wasn’t perfect. But it had onboarding, a rec engine, maps, data logic, Supabase integration. It worked. It existed. With a couple tweaks from a friend who codes, we turned it into a shareable prototype.

Total cost? $300.  
Time to launched product? 6 weeks.

That’s insane. A few years ago this would’ve cost us $20k and six months with a dev shop.

This new era is changing everything about being a builder

But that also means our leverage has changed. Execution isn’t the bottleneck. Knowing what to build is. And going to market.

Right now we're in the GTM phase, feels like this is the real challenge (as it always has been once you have a product).

But either way, this new tech an equalizer. Especially in markets like ours (we’re building this from Southeast Asia), where the cost of engineering talent has long been a major barrier. Suddenly, we don’t need to be in SF. We don’t need millions. We just need to be close to the problem and build for our segment.

We’re building something raw, real, and for the traveler who wants culture over checklists. If you care about:

* Exploring cities through the eyes of locals
* Replacing gamed recommendation engines with curated, lived experiences
* Building in public

Follow along. We’re just getting started. And feel free to try the product here

Because if we’re going back to 1800s hydration practices… we might as well make it social.

At **DanceCard**, we’re all about helping Richmonders meet up and do things together IRL — especially when the city throws curveballs like this.

Olivia’s POV

 

“Wake up, Olivia,” Mom’s voice echoed in my sleep.

 

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. “Five more minutes, Mom.”

 

“We don’t have any more minutes,” she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. “Get up now, or we’ll be late.”

 

“Mom,” I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

 

“Don’t tell me you still want to sleep,” she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. “Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?” Mother snapped angrily at me.

 

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. “I’m up, I’m up,” I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

 

“Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,” Mother announced, and my frown deepened. “Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?”

 

“Don’t start,” Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. “Get moving. There’s no time for complaining.”

 

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

 

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

 

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We’d grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

 

That was before everything fell apart.

 

My father was one of the pack’s strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

 

But everything changed the night of the setup.

 

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

 

Anita was there that night. She hadn’t comforted me, hadn’t spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

 

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta’s daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

 

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha’s sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

 

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid’s uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

 

“Olivia,” my mother called, “I know this isn’t easy, but… we’ve already lost so much. Don’t give them a reason to take more.”

 

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn’t understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

 

“Here,” my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. “She asked for this.”

 

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

 

“I’ll find my mate, and all this will be over,” I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

 

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn’t ending.

 

Reaching Anita’s room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I’d fallen, and how far she’d risen.

 

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

 

“Come in,” Anita’s voice called.

 

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. “Your coffee,” I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

 

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man’s voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

 

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

 

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

 

“Wait,” Anita said sharply.

 

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

 

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

 

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

 

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

 

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. “What is this?” she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

 

“It’s the coffee you requested,” I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

 

“This?” she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. “You call this coffee?”

 

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. “It was made in the way you like it,” I said.

 

Anita’s eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

 

“Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I’ll dump it on your face.”

 

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

 

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

 

“I’m sorry if the coffee wasn’t to your liking,” I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. “I’ll remake it.”

 

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. “Don’t bother,” she said, waving a dismissive hand. “Just try to be less useless next time.”

 

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn’t even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

 

“You’re dismissed,” he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

 

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

 

As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

 

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox’s personal guard. “There you are. Lennox calls for you,”

 

I frowned. “Did he say why?” I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

 

Bala shrugged. “Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.”

 

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox’s room.

 

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.

 

# Chapter 2: Accused

 

Olivia’s POV

 

Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.

 

The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.

 

But that was before.

 

Before everything fell apart.

 

Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.

 

“Who cleaned my room yesterday?” Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.

 

I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. “I did.”

 

Lennox’s expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.

 

“Then tell me, Omega,” he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, “where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?”

 

I froze, my heart racing as Lennox’s words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.

 

“I… I didn’t see any necklace,” I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.

 

Lennox’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t lie to me, Omega,” he growled, his tone laced with anger. “The necklace didn’t just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.”

 

“I’m not lying!” I protested, panic creeping into my voice. “I cleaned the room, but I didn’t take anything. I swear!”

 

He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. “You expect me to believe that?” he snapped. “You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.”

 

His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.

 

“I didn’t take it,” I repeated, my voice steadier this time. “You can search me if you don’t believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.”

 

Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.

 

I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers’ pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.

 

Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.

 

“I can’t find it, Olivia. It’s gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?” he asked in anger.

 

I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. “I did not take it…”

 

“Lies!” he angrily cut me off.

 

Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. “This doesn’t make sense,” he muttered. “You cleaned my room. You were the last one here.” His gaze hardened. “Don’t lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?”

 

When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.

 

“You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!” he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.

 

Lennox’s words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn’t matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.

 

“Only two people came into this room yesterday,” Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. “You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?”

 

I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.

 

I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior’s silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha’s Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

 

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.

 

Who would dare enter Lennox’s room and steal something so valuable?

 

No one.

 

No one except Anita.

 

But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn’t say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I’d only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.

 

“I didn’t take it,” I said again.

 

Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. “You think I’m stupid, don’t you?”

 

I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn’t. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn’t matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.

 

“You know what, Olivia?” Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. “I’m done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn’t turn up by the end of the day, I’ll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.”

 

His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. “I didn’t take it,” I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.

 

Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. “I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,” he growled.

 

I didn’t need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.

 

Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn’t believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.

 

“Here you are, Olivia,” a guard said as he walked over to me. “Levi is looking for you, and he doesn’t seem happy.”

 

The guard’s announcement made my heart sink in fear.

 

“Why? What happened?” I asked, terrified.

 

Joshua, the guard, shook his head. “I don’t know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.”

Grab a coffee and start your day off with some optimism. Each morning, I will share a few recent optimistic news articles in various sections so you can start your day off in a hopeful mood rather than being all doomy and gloomy.

* “Wholly Optimistic” are stories that for the most part that should leave you feeling good after reading them without much of a caveat.
* “Cautiously Optimistic” are stories that can have caveats or may be things that could turn out bad, but for right now, are good.
* “I Dissent” are stories of protests or certain figures speaking out against bad policies or injustices.
* “Take the Edge Off” are stories that are feel good and may deal with topics that are less partisan or heated.

I wanted to try that out too, but then had the idea to just fill in the Personality section with several back and forths revealing their personality, and treat it as the Example Dialog section, but show exactly how I wanted the RP to be. I then deleted the example dialog and left the actual section blank. I used very descritptive language, to show details and things in the scene, and it worked pretty well. I might start using this method to save time instead but don't know.

I did put a very few brief things in Scenario for context. here's an example of what I put in Personality:
1st line what my char says/does. Enter key once.
2nd line The bots elaboration on. The bot's char reaction. And a pinch of scenery description.
3rd line blank. I enter twice so there's a gap between this and the next section.

I noticed right after eating red meat for instance, my farts would smell very offensive. They would linger and even I would mind. Once a week passed without meat the smell of my farts went away. I could fart in the couch during a sitting and no one would smell it. I tried this a few times where I consumed meat and I literally had side effect such as zits ( im fukin 40) and lethargy. When I consumed my usual 2000+ calories of None meat or dairy ( Beans , Greens , Legumes , Nuts , Etc...

Right When I introduce meat even just 14 oz of 96 lean ground beef along with my greens is when I get side effects even my bowels schedule gets changed until I detox from the meat.

I never really chose to be a vegan but it seems everything else is none consumable. Between the chemicals in the meats and the ultra processed food imitations it's hard to eat anything but raw and lightly processed . Seed oils in everything , sugar in everything , chemicals and preservatives.

I have a knowledge of all the documentaries on the food system those pro and against meat and/or vegan but from my personal experience I feel the chemicals , antibiotics , and other sh!t injected in the animal is leeching into me and coming out through my pores. especially after learning they have to "" degas"" the cow and do things like stick their hand in it and empty it. - like yuck .

# Ava's POV

# The room froze when I saw him kiss her. One second I was hidden in the shadows, and the next my claws were digging into my palms, blood dripping onto the marble floor.

# Control, Ava. You can't shift here.

I stood in the darkest corner of Moonlight Lodge's ballroom. My champagne tasted like cardboard. Shadow Creek pack was still a mess after our Alpha's death last month. Not the time or place for me to lose control.

Jackson and Sophia swayed on the dance floor. My ex-fated mate couldn't keep his hands off the Silverpeak princess. When she laughed at whatever he whispered, pain shot through my mark.

My neck burned where he'd marked me. Four months ago, he swore we were meant to be. Now he's chasing power instead of love. His plan was simple: marry the Alpha King's daughter, become Shadow Creek's next Alpha. Easy upgrade from dating a nobody like me.

My fangs were already pressing against my lower lip. No amount of breathing exercises would stop this shift if I stayed watching them another minute.

I set down my champagne and made a beeline for the bar. Maybe alcohol could drown the rage before I fully transformed in a room full of elites who'd eat me alive for the entertainment value.

""Double whiskey,"" I growled, not bothering to hide the gravel in my voice. The bartender's eyes widened at what must have been the yellow glow of my irises.

""Make that a Moonlight Martini for the lady,"" a deep voice cut in. ""And the whiskey for me.""

My wolf froze mid-snarl. Just... stopped. Like someone had hit pause on her fury.

I turned and looked up—way up—into eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea. They weren't just looking at me; they were seeing through me.

He wasn't pretty-boy handsome like Jackson. This man's face had character—laugh lines at the corners of his eyes, a slight crease between his brows from frowning too much. Dark hair with silver at the temples. His suit fit him like a second skin, but couldn't hide the raw power underneath.

But his scent—*fuck*. Rain-soaked pine trees, woodsmoke, and something wild that made my wolf sit up and beg. The complete opposite to Jackson's cologne-masked scent that never made my wolf react like this.

""I didn't ask for your input,"" I said, trying to sound tough while my wolf was practically rolling over.

One corner of his mouth kicked up. ""You're about thirty seconds from shifting in a roomful of pack leaders. The drink has wolfsbane extract. It'll help.""

I glanced down at my hands. Claws, not fingernails.

""Whatever,"" I muttered.

The bartender slid over the martini—swirling silver-blue like moonlight on water.

The stranger leaned closer. ""Drink up. Your eyes are giving you away.""

I knocked it back in one go, grimacing at the bitter aftertaste.

""Better?"" he asked, voice so deep I felt it in my chest.

The effect was almost immediate. My wolf settled, claws retracting, teeth returning to normal.

""Thanks,"" I said reluctantly. ""Though I'm not sure why you give a damn if I make a scene.""

His eyes flicked to the dance floor, then back to me with unexpected heat. ""Let's just say I have a soft spot for underdogs.""

Before I could respond, people started moving aside, stepping back to clear a path. For him. The penny dropped.

""You're Blake Morgan,"" I said, my stomach doing a backflip. ""The Silverpeak Alpha.""

*The Alpha King. The one who could destroy every Alpha in the world with a single command.*

My wolf cowered and preened at the same time, a confusing mix.

""And you're wearing a mate mark that's being rejected."" His gaze dropped to my neck where the silver-white mark throbbed. ""Who did that to you?""

The question hung between us. Telling the Alpha King that his future son-in-law had marked and abandoned me seemed like a bad idea.

""Someone who decided power was more attractive than keeping his word,"" I said instead.

His eyes narrowed slightly. ""Your control is slipping again. Come with me.""

It wasn't a suggestion. The words carried the weight of Alpha command, pressing against my will. My wolf, weirdly, didn't mind.

He guided me toward a private elevator, not touching me but close enough that his body heat reached across the inches between us. My skin prickled like I'd stuck my finger in an outlet.

The top floor suite was bigger than my entire house. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the forest and mountains beyond, silver moonlight pouring across dark furniture.

He went to a cabinet, returning with a glass of water and some dried herbs.

""Chew these,"" he instructed.

I raised an eyebrow. ""You always carry herbs for random werewolves having meltdowns?""

""Only the interesting ones."" Something dangerous flashed in his eyes. ""The mark on your neck—it's making you lose control, isn't it?""

I touched it reflexively, wincing. ""They never covered 'what to do when your fated mate dumps you' in werewolf school.""

""It's strange to see a marked wolf without their mate present."" His voice dropped lower. ""Especially at an event where that mate might be.""

The gears turned behind his eyes. He was connecting the dots—my reaction downstairs, the mark, his daughter's fiancé.

""It's Jackson, isn't it?"" he asked quietly. ""My daughter's fiancé marked you.""

I couldn't speak, but my silence said it all.

""When?""

""Four months ago,"" I said, tasting the bitterness. ""Right before he decided being the next Shadow Creek Alpha was worth more than honoring a fated mate bond.""

Blake's jaw tightened, the only sign that my words hit home. ""And he never tried to break the mark properly?""

""Apparently dumping me in a coffee shop with 'it's not personal, it's politics' counts as closure in his book.""

Blake moved closer, his scent wrapping around me like a warm blanket. My wolf, who should have been cowering before the most powerful Alpha in our world, was instead practically purring.

""May I?"" His fingers hovered near my neck, not quite touching the mark.

I should have said no. This was Sophia's father. Jackson's future father-in-law. But my wolf pressed forward, tilting my head to expose the mark.

When his fingertips brushed my skin, lightning shot through me. His eyes darkened, pupils expanding.

Something flashed in his expression—surprise, confusion, then interest.

Instead of pulling away, he traced the outline of the mark. Heat bloomed from his touch, not the burning pain I'd gotten used to, but something warm and sweet that pooled low in my belly.

I couldn't deny it. My wolf was straining toward him like he was the last steak on earth.

""Why?"" I whispered.

*Why am I reacting to my ex's future father-in-law?*

He shook his head slowly, still touching my neck. ""I don't know what this is. But I want to find out.""

The pull between us grew stronger with each heartbeat. When he finally leaned down, it felt inevitable—his mouth meeting mine with a hunger that matched my own. My hands grabbed his shirt, dragging him closer. His arms wrapped around me, lifting me effortlessly against him.

It was crazy. Completely nuts. He was the father of the woman who'd stolen my mate. The most powerful werewolf alive. And I was nobody—just a Delta's adopted daughter with a worthless mate mark.

My wolf didn't care. She recognized something in him that cut through all that human BS.

Just as his hands slid lower, a voice sliced through my mind:

*Ava... they took your father...*

I gasped, color draining from my face. My mother's voice, shaky and terrified, crashed through our mindlink with an urgency that chilled my blood.Chapter 2: When Second Chances Don't Exist

**Ava's POV**

I jerked away from Blake, the moment shattered. ""Damn. I have to go.""

His hands lingered on my waist before dropping reluctantly. Something flickered in those storm-gray eyes—disappointment, maybe frustration.

""Walk out that door, and this moment ends."" No question, no plea. Pure Alpha statement of fact.

My wolf actually whimpered, clawing to stay. The human part of me—the part that remembered every sacrifice my adoptive parents made—knew better.

""This is your only chance."" His voice went deeper, rumbling through my chest.

One chance. That was Blake Morgan's notorious rule. The Alpha King never chased, never begged, never offered second helpings. Hell, women practically lined up for their single shot at him.

""I get it."" I stepped back, each inch between us physically painful. ""But my dad needs me.""

Just like that, his face shut down. The man who'd kissed me vanished, replaced by the impenetrable mask of the Alpha King. ""Then I wish you luck.""

I bolted before my wolf could convince me to stay, the taste of him still on my lips.

I practically kicked our front door off its hinges twenty minutes later. Mom's scent led me straight to the kitchen. Our house—once the proud home of respected Delta William Rivers—now screamed neglect from every creaky floorboard.

Mom hunched at the kitchen table, gripping a mug of cold tea, her shoulders quivering.

""Mom?"" My voice cracked. ""What the hell happened?""

She looked up with puffy, red-rimmed eyes. ""Shadow Creek guards took him. Right from his office.""

""On what grounds?"" My claws slid out before I could stop them.

""Treason."" The word hung between us like poison. ""They're saying he betrayed our Alpha. Got him killed in that border clash last month.""

My claws dug into the counter. ""That's bullshit! Dad worshipped Alpha Carter! Where's the evidence? The trial?""

Mom's laugh was hollow. ""Evidence? Trials?"" She shook her head. ""The Council just needs someone to blame. Your father was convenient.""

I paced the kitchen, my wolf thrashing beneath my skin. ""This can't be happening.""

""Unless someone with rank uses the Blood Protection Right..."" Her voice trailed off. ""His execution is set for the next full moon.""

Blood Protection Right. Our world's version of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Only problem? You needed influence to use it. Something our family no longer had.

My phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen and nearly chucked it across the room.

Jackson.

I hovered my thumb over ""decline,"" then hesitated. If that asshole could help Dad...

""What?"" I snapped, accepting the call.

""Heard about William."" His voice oozed fake concern. ""I might have a solution. But not over the phone. Come outside.""

My wolf snarled, but I swallowed my pride. ""Fine.""

I squeezed Mom's shoulder. ""I'll fix this. Somehow.""

Jackson lounged against his shiny black SUV in our driveway, looking like a goddamn cologne ad. My stomach knotted. His scent hit me—expensive aftershave masking calculated ambition. Nothing like Blake's raw thunderstorm-and-pine smell that had my wolf drooling.

The mate-mark on my neck pulsed, a constant reminder of Jackson's betrayal. Two years of promises. Two years of ""you're my everything"" and ""we're meant to be."" Then he traded me for a power play faster than most people change socks.

I stopped ten feet away, arms crossed. ""What do you want?""

""Your father's in trouble."" He stated the obvious, examining his manicured nails.

""No shit. Why are you here?""

Jackson's practiced smile appeared—the one that used to make my knees weak. I looked away, focusing on a crack in the driveway.

""I can help."" He pushed off the car. ""As future Alpha of Shadow Creek, I have the authority to use the Blood Protection Right. I could save William from execution.""

I snapped my gaze back to his. He looked so damn pleased with himself.

""And what would that cost us?"" The bitter taste of suspicion filled my mouth.

His smile widened into something predatory. ""Just one small condition.""

I waited, jaw clenched.

""After I marry Sophia, you become my secret lover."" He said it like he was offering me a job promotion.

I actually laughed. ""Excuse me?""

""I've already set up a place for us."" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a seductive murmur. ""Private. Comfortable. I'll take care of everything—your father's pardon, your needs, all of it.""

The Alpha King could silence a room with a look. Jackson needed this pathetic bargain to flex his so-called power.

""You're seriously asking me to be your side piece while you play happy family with Sophia?"" My voice wavered despite my best efforts.

He moved closer, and my body betrayed me with an involuntary shiver. The bond forcing a response even while my mind screamed in revolt.

""We were magic together, Ava."" His fingers brushed my neck. ""Even after I mark Sophia, we'll have this connection. Your father lives. You get taken care of. Win-win.""

I jerked away, breaking through the invisible hold. ""Screw. You.""

His eyes flashed amber. ""Think about what you're turning down. I'm offering your father's life.""

""I'll find another way."" I backed toward the house. ""Now get off our property.""

""You'll change your mind."" He smirked, walking backwards to his car. ""Meanwhile, Daddy's execution clock keeps ticking.""

""We don't need you!"" I shouted, my fists clenched so tight my palms bled.

He paused with his hand on the car door. ""To save him, you need the Alpha King's direct intervention. Nobody but me has access to Blake Morgan. Nobody risks their neck for a traitor.""

His smile turned cruel before he slid into his car and peeled out, leaving me choking on exhaust and rage.

I waited until his taillights disappeared before I crumpled. My knees hit the gravel and a sob ripped through me, raw and ugly.

Jackson wasn't wrong about one thing—only the Alpha King could override a treason charge. But I'd rather eat glass than become Jackson's dirty secret.

My wolf thrashed beneath my skin. I touched the side of my neck, remembering Blake's fingers there—how his touch had calmed something wild inside me.

I needed to see him again. Even if the he never offered second chances.

The next morning, Warrior Academy buzzed with the usual chaos of werewolf students.

""Holy shit, you look wrecked."" Ella, my best friend, dropped her backpack next to me under our usual oak tree.

I flipped open my tactical manual, pretending to care about flanking maneuvers. ""Thanks. Just what every girl wants to hear.""

She nudged my boot with hers. ""Seriously, what happened? One minute you were at Moonlight Lodge, the next—poof. Ghost mode.""

I chewed my lip. Lying to Ella was pointless. The girl could sniff out my bullshit faster than a bloodhound on cocaine.

""Almost wolfed out in the ballroom."" I kept my eyes on the book. ""Someone helped me get it under control.""

""Someone?"" She snatched my manual away. ""Spill it. Your ears are turning red.""

I sighed, meeting her eyes. ""Blake Morgan.""

Her jaw actually dropped. ""The Alpha King took you... where exactly?""

""His suite,"" I mumbled.

Ella's eyebrows shot up. ""And?""

""And nothing,"" I lied.

She grabbed my arm, fingers digging in. ""Ava Rivers, your heart rate just spiked. What. Happened?""

I cracked. ""We might have kissed. A little.""

""A little?"" She whisper-screamed. ""There's no 'little' kissing with the Alpha King! That's like saying you were 'a little' on fire!""

I smacked her arm. ""Keep your voice down! It was just—""

""Just what? Earth-shattering? Life-altering? Panty-melting?""

Despite everything, I laughed. ""All of the above? But it doesn't matter now. I need to see him again.""

Her smile vanished. ""But everyone says he never—""

""I know."" I cut her off, determination settling in my chest. ""But my dad's life depends on it.""",1,1748434123.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

""This is your only chance."" His voice went deeper, rumbling through my chest.

One chance. That was Blake Morgan's notorious rule. The Alpha King never chased, never begged, never offered second helpings. Hell, women practically lined up for their single shot at him.

""I get it."" I stepped back, each inch between us physically painful. ""But my dad needs me.""

Just like that, his face shut down. The man who'd kissed me vanished, replaced by the impenetrable mask of the Alpha King. ""Then I wish you luck.""

I bolted before my wolf could convince me to stay, the taste of him still on my lips.

I practically kicked our front door off its hinges twenty minutes later. Mom's scent led me straight to the kitchen. Our house—once the proud home of respected Delta William Rivers—now screamed neglect from every creaky floorboard.

Mom hunched at the kitchen table, gripping a mug of cold tea, her shoulders quivering.

""Mom?"" My voice cracked. ""What the hell happened?""

She looked up with puffy, red-rimmed eyes. ""Shadow Creek guards took him. Right from his office.""

""On what grounds?"" My claws slid out before I could stop them.

""Treason."" The word hung between us like poison. ""They're saying he betrayed our Alpha. Got him killed in that border clash last month.""

My claws dug into the counter. ""That's bullshit! Dad worshipped Alpha Carter! Where's the evidence? The trial?""

Mom's laugh was hollow. ""Evidence? Trials?"" She shook her head. ""The Council just needs someone to blame. Your father was convenient.""

I paced the kitchen, my wolf thrashing beneath my skin. ""This can't be happening.""

""Unless someone with rank uses the Blood Protection Right..."" Her voice trailed off. ""His execution is set for the next full moon.""

Blood Protection Right. Our world's version of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Only problem? You needed influence to use it. Something our family no longer had.

My phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen and nearly chucked it across the room.

Jackson.

I hovered my thumb over ""decline,"" then hesitated. If that asshole could help Dad...

""What?"" I snapped, accepting the call.

""Heard about William."" His voice oozed fake concern. ""I might have a solution. But not over the phone. Come outside.""

My wolf snarled, but I swallowed my pride. ""Fine.""

I squeezed Mom's shoulder. ""I'll fix this. Somehow.""

Jackson lounged against his shiny black SUV in our driveway, looking like a goddamn cologne ad. My stomach knotted. His scent hit me—expensive aftershave masking calculated ambition. Nothing like Blake's raw thunderstorm-and-pine smell that had my wolf drooling.

The mate-mark on my neck pulsed, a constant reminder of Jackson's betrayal. Two years of promises. Two years of ""you're my everything"" and ""we're meant to be."" Then he traded me for a power play faster than most people change socks.

I stopped ten feet away, arms crossed. ""What do you want?""

""Your father's in trouble."" He stated the obvious, examining his manicured nails.

""No shit. Why are you here?""

Jackson's practiced smile appeared—the one that used to make my knees weak. I looked away, focusing on a crack in the driveway.

""I can help."" He pushed off the car. ""As future Alpha of Shadow Creek, I have the authority to use the Blood Protection Right. I could save William from execution.""

I snapped my gaze back to his. He looked so damn pleased with himself.

""And what would that cost us?"" The bitter taste of suspicion filled my mouth.

His smile widened into something predatory. ""Just one small condition.""

I waited, jaw clenched.

""After I marry Sophia, you become my secret lover."" He said it like he was offering me a job promotion.

I actually laughed. ""Excuse me?""

""I've already set up a place for us."" He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a seductive murmur. ""Private. Comfortable. I'll take care of everything—your father's pardon, your needs, all of it.""

The Alpha King could silence a room with a look. Jackson needed this pathetic bargain to flex his so-called power.

""You're seriously asking me to be your side piece while you play happy family with Sophia?"" My voice wavered despite my best efforts.

He moved closer, and my body betrayed me with an involuntary shiver. The bond forcing a response even while my mind screamed in revolt.

""We were magic together, Ava."" His fingers brushed my neck. ""Even after I mark Sophia, we'll have this connection. Your father lives. You get taken care of. Win-win.""

I jerked away, breaking through the invisible hold. ""Screw. You.""

His eyes flashed amber. ""Think about what you're turning down. I'm offering your father's life.""

""I'll find another way."" I backed toward the house. ""Now get off our property.""

""You'll change your mind."" He smirked, walking backwards to his car. ""Meanwhile, Daddy's execution clock keeps ticking.""

""We don't need you!"" I shouted, my fists clenched so tight my palms bled.

He paused with his hand on the car door. ""To save him, you need the Alpha King's direct intervention. Nobody but me has access to Blake Morgan. Nobody risks their neck for a traitor.""

His smile turned cruel before he slid into his car and peeled out, leaving me choking on exhaust and rage.

I waited until his taillights disappeared before I crumpled. My knees hit the gravel and a sob ripped through me, raw and ugly.

Jackson wasn't wrong about one thing—only the Alpha King could override a treason charge. But I'd rather eat glass than become Jackson's dirty secret.

My wolf thrashed beneath my skin. I touched the side of my neck, remembering Blake's fingers there—how his touch had calmed something wild inside me.

I needed to see him again. Even if the he never offered second chances.

The next morning, Warrior Academy buzzed with the usual chaos of werewolf students.

""Holy shit, you look wrecked."" Ella, my best friend, dropped her backpack next to me under our usual oak tree.

I flipped open my tactical manual, pretending to care about flanking maneuvers. ""Thanks. Just what every girl wants to hear.""

She nudged my boot with hers. ""Seriously, what happened? One minute you were at Moonlight Lodge, the next—poof. Ghost mode.""

I chewed my lip. Lying to Ella was pointless. The girl could sniff out my bullshit faster than a bloodhound on cocaine.

""Almost wolfed out in the ballroom."" I kept my eyes on the book. ""Someone helped me get it under control.""

""Someone?"" She snatched my manual away. ""Spill it. Your ears are turning red.""

I sighed, meeting her eyes. ""Blake Morgan.""

Her jaw actually dropped. ""The Alpha King took you... where exactly?""

""His suite,"" I mumbled.

Ella's eyebrows shot up. ""And?""

""And nothing,"" I lied.

She grabbed my arm, fingers digging in. ""Ava Rivers, your heart rate just spiked. What. Happened?""

I cracked. ""We might have kissed. A little.""

""A little?"" She whisper-screamed. ""There's no 'little' kissing with the Alpha King! That's like saying you were 'a little' on fire!""

I smacked her arm. ""Keep your voice down! It was just—""

""Just what? Earth-shattering? Life-altering? Panty-melting?""

Despite everything, I laughed. ""All of the above? But it doesn't matter now. I need to see him again.""

Her smile vanished. ""But everyone says he never—""

""I know."" I cut her off, determination settling in my chest. ""But my dad's life depends on it.""",1,1748434121.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone, Roel here! For months, I've been holed up, fueled by way too much coffee, working on something I genuinely believe will change how we moped riders navigate our cities. Today, my passion project, **Urban Rider**, is finally live on the App Store!

As a moped rider myself (max 50 mph crew, you know the struggle!), I was constantly frustrated with existing navigation apps. They just don't get us. Highways designed for cars, endless detours, and missing out on those perfect urban shortcuts. So, I decided to build what we needed.

**Urban Rider** isn't just another navigation app. It's built from the ground up for mopeds. We're talking:

* **Moped-Specific Routing:** Say goodbye to unwanted highway detours. Urban Rider prioritizes routes perfect for our speed and vehicle type.
* **Intuitive & Clear Interface:** Designed for quick glances so you can keep your eyes on the road.
* **Your Co-Pilot for the City:** Discover hidden gems and enjoy seamless rides without the stress.

I poured my heart and soul into every detail, making sure it feels like it was built by a rider, for riders. It's been a long few months, but seeing Urban Rider finally out there is incredibly exciting.

If you're a moped rider looking for a navigation experience that *finally* understands your needs, please check out **Urban Rider** on the App Store.

**Download Urban Rider today and let me know what you think!**

So during the week when she gets home from work she has notes to do. Usually until 9pm. She takes the kids to school in the AM and picks them up. Her schedule allows for it so that’s how it’s been. 

I work in construction. Jobs are always an hour away. I leave my house at 4:30 to get to gym at 5. I sacrifice sleep to be able to exercise. I leave at 6 to get to work for 7. My job is very physical, often times burning 800+ calories at work. I leave at 3 to get home by 4/4:30. I immediately jump into cooking dinner for the family when I get home (because my wife is working). I clean up the dishes after and then will do the kids baths/showers. There’s usually an hour lul before their bedtimes where I’ll attempt to do some self care, but often times I’m cleaning up the house, doing laundry, or something else like that. Once the kids are in bed I get an hour to myself before I join my wife around 9 to spend some time with her. I make a point to do that every night. 

I try to be the leader of the household. Not in a manipulating, power hungry way. But I strive to be a good husband and father figure. I am so burned out from this routine. I have spoken to her about it many, many times and she makes empty promises of helping. I know it shouldn’t take her 4-5 hours to do her notes because occasionally she will go to a coffee shop to do the work before getting the kids and can complete it within an hour. 

When I confront her about the empty promises she begins gaslighting me, saying I’m overreacting and trying to manipulate her. Saying I’m mean and just want to be lazy or that I don’t respect her and her work. 

I have not had “me” time in months. Our weekends are filled with birthday parties, holidays, weddings, and other family related stuff. My wife thinks the hour of sleep I sacrifice to workout in the morning is “free time”. I don’t even know what to say to her sometimes. She snapped at me in front of one of my son’s friends mom yesterday and it took everything in me to not snap back and be the bigger person. 

Am I an asshole for being upset about this? I am so strung out from the routine I’ve been unable to keep up with my exercise regiment I have done for 15 years. I try very hard to speak to her with kindness, but she is quick to jump to conclusions and point the finger. I love her and want to see our family thrive in harmony, but I can’t keep going on like this. When I try to bring up how I feel and the weight on my shoulders she always manages to turn the conversation around to make it sound like an attack on her. I just don’t know what to say anymore to get through to her. I can’t say virtually anything without backlash and an inevitable fight. ",2,1748433846.0,AIO,1,1.0,False

1kxf94o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kxf94o/should_i_come_clean_about_the_fwb/,Should I come clean about the FWB,"Hey Reddit. Please help.
TLDR: I (32F) just met someone (29M) who gives me all the butterflies and don’t wanna mess it up. When the past relationship topic comes up should I tell him about my FWB (M34) who I’ve been hanging out with for the past 6 months?

Context:
I’ve been single for about two years now, was left by a fiancé - totally out of the blue. Tried dating other people with worse than bad luck for the past two years. I’ve been on and off dating apps, even met people from Reddit (interestingly it was better than the apps lol.)

I have a FWB who I’ve been seeing for about 6 months now. We met on a dating app, had one date but we are just not compatible. However, he lives around the corner, it’s super handy, we keep it exclusive (neither of us is interested in STDs lol)
and honestly it’s just great cause we can be candid about it all. No BS.
We have a pact that if there was ever any kind of emotion on either side we would break it off, because we don’t want to hurt each other.
It’s respectful but nothing serious, we just chat, have a drink, have some fun and I usually don’t even spend the night. We barely keep in touch apart from the get togethers, maybe we would text once a week if even…
We talked about the scenario of meeting other people (we are both single and interested in finding something serious) and agreed that if either of us finds something dating worthy, we would break off this arrangement. For their sake, cause it wouldn’t be fair on the third party.
I’m not worried about him, whatever happens I think we will be ok.

However…I met a guy over the weekend out in a pub, randomly, I wasn’t even looking to meet anyone, it just happened and we had a really fun night. Even though he tried the “let’s go get a hotel room” - which I turned down - he was super respectful and kind. Had a proper, sober first date on Monday evening. Was better than I expected. I haven’t had these kinda butterflies/fireworks in almost 10 years, I genuinely think this could be something serious and just don’t want to fuck it up before it even starts.

So I’m not worried about FWB, I’m worried about the guy I just met. What do I say when the past relationships topic comes up?
I don’t want to lie about my past, I’m not ashamed of it. In some ways this FWB situationship was one of the most grown up relationships I’ve ever had…but the pure fact that FWB lives so close and this new guy lives about 2.5 hours away…I don’t want to freak him out. Not to mention maybe other people are not so okay with FWB relationships to begin with. Don’t want to be judged for it.

I’m planning on breaking it off with FWB in the next few days. Haven’t said anything to him yet because I want to do it in person - probably a coffee or something, obviously NOT gonna go to his, but still, want to do it as a decent person.

Question:
So Reddit, should I just keep FWB a secret or should I tell the new guy about him?

Yesterday I was able afterschool to hang out with Jean, our Jammy bass player and lead singer. She told me bits about her parents’ breakfast with Professor Kurtz this weekend.

“He’s a very smart man! The first part of the gig he was just gushing with praise. Did you hear what she just did! Look how she’s leading the band! Strong, confident, but in the background. Look at her eyes. She doesn’t need to look at her instrument—she knows it! Listen how she provides the chord structure but look what she does before placing a downbeat note—her chromatics and aharmonics. She intentionally adds layers of texture by getting lost and then refinding herself.”

“OK, my parents knew I was playing at a high level for my age, but Professor let them know why. They apologized to me and said they just didn’t know what to know. They said they have my full support if I decide to take the conservatory route.”

I told Jean that Professor used the same technique on my folk. Butter them up with praise and then zing it.

“Exactly. He said I’m relying on innate talent and imitating the work of others. That’s great, he said, but he doesn’t think I understand *why* this works and this doesn’t. He said I need conservatory training to gain this knowledge. 

“It’s essential,” he said, “in addition to jazz, that I deeply study bass in the classical repertory including bow work. I’ve heard her play bass guitar when I visited the band in the school practice room but she needs to go seamlessly between both instruments. She does just fine in defining the harmonic structure and chord roots but she is stronger on her obligatory target notes than her approach notes. To do this she needs theory, theory, theory.”

He told them that there’s a whole science now on something called “expertism” which researches how people move from “knowing” to “really knowing” and this is what the conservatory teaches. He knows I am also interested in becoming a doctor but expertism will flow into any profession I choose.

Jean now shared: “I need to work more on using the bass in a percussive way. I need to balance hitting a note with strumming and muting. I need to learn to better supplement Alice’s playing on the drums. My teachers have done a good job teaching me playing time, stop time, and making changes. But my walking bass-lines need a world more variety. He hasn’t heard me riff or solo yet and wonders why. He hasn’t heard Jammy work on Afro-Cuban or Latin music and also wonders why. It’s essential.”

Jean felt that Professor is brilliant. He helped her parents know what she has accomplished  as a musician but also how much more she has to go. They are very excited now. And do is she!

A whale client with 1,000 employees, wants to get going ASAP, and is asking for a price. The thing with whales… they have big egos. And they move kinda slow. If we are not careful, it could take months to move them from a successful coffee date to going live.

I see this happen all the time. We are at a critical point here. We MUST position ourselves as the CHOOSER, not the CHOSEN. Otherwise, they run the show. And we never get that power back.

Do you see what I did here? I am kinda passive-aggressive, in a nice way.

* I set my boundaries.
* I make it very clear to them that I am gonna walk unless they move fast.
* I make it very clear that I am looking for partners, not clients.
* I make it very clear I will walk if they are not my type of partner.

It's kinda like “𝘔𝘳 𝘊𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵… 𝘭𝘦𝘵'𝘴 𝘥𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘮𝘺 𝘸𝘢𝘺, 𝘰𝘳 𝘭𝘦𝘵’𝘴 𝘮𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘰𝘯” It just works.

Now… moving on to how much to charge? I usually do my tests on a backend deal - no costs up front. But, considering they are asking for the price. I am not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

He may lose this deal by going in at £10K + VAT? But, because they loved the Demo so much, I'm pretty sure this dude is gonna get an upfront payment IF he just asks for it!

I hope this helps!

1kxf68h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Development/comments/1kxf68h/remember_that_time_i_spent_hours_debugging_a_tiny/,Remember that time I spent hours debugging a tiny typo? Agentic AI might make that a relic of the past.,"So, I was thinking the other day about all the ridiculous hours I've poured into debugging code over the years. We all have those war stories, right? Like the time I spent an entire Saturday trying to figure out why a seemingly perfect piece of code was breaking, only to discover a missing semicolon buried deep in a config file. Or the infamous off-by-one error that haunted me for days. We've all been there, pulling our hair out over something so trivial.

It got me thinking about where software development is heading, especially with all the buzz around AI. We've had AI assistants for a while now, helping us with autocompletion and suggestions. But what if AI could do more than just suggest? What if it could understand the problem, strategize a solution, and then execute it, all without us having to hold its hand every step of the way?

That's where the idea of ""Agentic AI"" comes in, and honestly, it’s a game-changer. Imagine waking up, grabbing your coffee, and seeing that your AI assistant has already identified a bug from last night's commit, diagnosed the root cause, and even submitted a pull request with the fix. Sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. But it's becoming a very real possibility.

Of course, it's not without its challenges. But the potential for transforming how we build software, making it faster, more efficient, and perhaps even more enjoyable, is pretty incredible.





If you're curious to dig deeper into how Agentic AI is shaping the future of software development, I highly recommend checking out this blog post- [https://datafortune.com/how-agentic-ai-can-shape-the-future-of-software-development/](https://datafortune.com/how-agentic-ai-can-shape-the-future-of-software-development/)",0,1748433398.0,Development,0,0.5,False

Cool.

Wanna know what it's like?

Imagine waking up every day and walking into a building older than your grandma’s regret. Paint peeling off the walls. Ceiling fans that sound like dying helicopters. Professors who look at you like you killed their dreams — because maybe you did, just by showing up.

Now imagine paying ₹10 lakh for that experience.

No?

Then come to Gujarat’s government engineering colleges.

LDCE. VGEC. GECGN. Places where even the ghosts are too tired to haunt. Where the syllabus hasn’t changed since dinosaurs coded in C. Where the only thing that works properly is the attendance sheet.

And yet…

Somehow, through this beautifully broken mess…

People rise.

A kid with chalk dust on his shirt becomes a UPSC AIR 3. A girl coding on a borrowed laptop cracks GATE and builds rockets for ISRO. A batchmate who failed thermodynamics thrice now earns ₹20 LPA in a foreign timezone.

Not because these colleges are magical. But because they don’t pretend to be.

No free coffee. No ping pong tables. Just four years of boredom, burnout, and brief existential clarity. And in that clarity, if you're lucky — you figure it out.

You learn. Not just subjects. But survival. How to push. How to fail. How to laugh at the absurdity. How to build a life out of a place that gave you nothing.

And best of all?

You don’t start your career shackled to a ₹10 lakh debt. You don’t spend your twenties paying for the illusion of prestige. You’re free. Broke, maybe — but free.

And sometimes, that’s all you need.

So yeah.

You’re still gonna cry at 3 AM. Still gonna hate group projects. Still gonna stare into the abyss and ask why you exist.

But at least, you’ll do it for ₹10k. Not 10 lakh. Not your soul.

Just 10k.

That’s a damn good deal.

TL;DR:
Engineering will ruin you either way.
At least let it ruin you for ₹10k, not ₹10 lakh.

1kxf3pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kxf3pk/does_the_dumos_portable_ice_maker_deliver_on_its/,Does the DUMOS Portable Ice Maker Deliver On Its Promises Review?,"Testing out the **DUMOS Portable Self-Cleaning Ice Maker Machine (B0CQKXND5B)** has been quite the adventure for someone like me who enjoys entertaining friends and family. Ice is essential in our house; whether it's for cocktail parties or keeping our seafood platters icy fresh, this countertop device has definitely proven itself. However, it’s not entirely without its quirks. Sharing my hands-on experience, both the ups and downs, should give you a good idea of what it’s like to have this machine chilling in your kitchen.  

**Compact, Yet Generous in Capacity**  
The design feels thoughtful—it’s compact, measuring just 11.6 x 8.8 x 12.5 inches, making it ideal for placing on the kitchen counter or even on a small bar cart. Weighing about 18 pounds, it’s light enough to carry around, thanks to the built-in handle. Perfect for taking to an outdoor BBQ or setting up in an RV. Despite the small size, the 1.5-liter water capacity provides up to 26.5 pounds of ice in 24 hours, easily covering the needs of a family gathering. Its transparent lid adds a nice touch for those of us who are easily entertained by watching the ice-making process.  

[Find the best price for DUMOS B0CQKXND5B on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cqkxnd5b/)  

**Quick Ice Production**  
This machine doesn’t believe in wasting time. In just 6 minutes, it cranks out 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes, which I found smooth to the touch. Whether I needed smaller cubes for chilling beers or larger ones for cocktails, this ice maker delivered. Those who like smooth ice will appreciate the rounded bullet shape—it doesn’t sting your hands or scrape your lips like jagged, store-bought ice.  

**Self-Cleaning Feature**  
As someone who tends to avoid products that are a hassle to clean, the self-cleaning function here is a game-changer. A quick press of the power button for 5 seconds initiates the cleaning process. I was thrilled at how simple it was to maintain, especially since it ensures I'm getting clean and safe ice every time. Gone are the days of scrubbing grime out of an ice tray.  

**Two Ice Cube Sizes for Every Occasion**  
Having the flexibility to choose between two ice cube sizes turned out to be more useful than I anticipated. I used the small cubes for presentations like seafood trays, while the larger cubes were excellent for cooling down beverages quickly. Whether you’re hosting brunch with iced coffee or a late-night party with icy cocktails, this feature genuinely makes the unit versatile.  

**Perks**  
- Portable with a sturdy handle for easy carrying.  
- Quick ice-making—9 cubes in just 6 minutes.  
- Extremely user-friendly control panel.  
- Quiet operation, barely louder than a refrigerator.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The indicator lights can be overly sensitive, alerting you that the ice basket is full even when it isn’t brimming. Occasionally, I found myself having to remove a few cubes prematurely.  
- Its lightweight build might not feel as durable as other bulkier options on the market.  
- If you want to make ice in bulk for a huge party, you might need to monitor and refill the water tank multiple times.

**Other Options**  
Looking around, I considered a few of its direct competitors. Devices like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker and the Frigidaire EFIC103 drew my attention. While the GE Opal makes the sought-after nugget-style ice and boasts a luxurious look, it’s significantly more expensive. The Frigidaire option, meanwhile, holds more water at once but takes longer to produce a first batch of ice. In my opinion, the DUMOS Portable Ice Maker stands out for its affordability, balanced features, and functionality despite a few quirks.  

**Quality for Price**  
This ice maker punches above its weight in terms of the value it offers. It has some practical features unusual in its price range, like self-cleaning and two ice cube sizes. While it might not have the industrial sturdiness of pricier options, it certainly serves the purpose well for casual use. We heavily rely on ours during the holidays and it doesn’t disappoint when used as intended.

It sucks because I already have a whole lifetime of credit monitoring. I just want companies, vendors, and data collection and processing companies to take their duties of protecting our “data” and digital assets seriously!!!

What's your take on pen testing? 
That yearly security ""check-up""? It’s mostly useless. 😬

You’re probably just ticking a box, not getting safer.

Look, I get it. ""Penetration testing"" sounds intense, like something only big corporations do. But for us, solo flyers and brand builders, waiting for a yearly test (if we even do one!) is like locking the barn door after the horse has bolted and set up its rival barn. Bit late, innit?
The real win isn't that one-off deep dive. It's making security a little habit.

I once set up a new client portal and was super proud. Then, I totally forgot to try logging in as a fake user with bad intentions—basic, I know! I found out during a random ""what if"" moment. It could have been messy.

Instead of a yearly panic, try this:

 * Mini-Checks, Often: Pick ONE thing a month. New plugin? Test it. A new way you share files? Poke it. It takes about 30 minutes.

 * The ""What If"" Game: Before launching anything new (a course, a freebie, a new site feature), spend 15 minutes trying to ""break"" it from a user's POV. What's the dumbest thing someone could do? What if they try to access something they shouldn't?

 * Peer Pokes: Got a freelancer buddy? Spend an hour trying to (ethically!) find holes in each other's main website or funnel. The winner buys coffee. Or the loser fixes the flaws. 😉

It’s not about becoming a security guru. It’s about making small, regular pokes at your stuff. Less ""formal test"" and more ""constant curiosity."" There is way less drama than a real breach.

So, keep paying for that once-a-year checkbox if it makes you sleep. Or... secure your stuff?
What's your take – am I off base here?

I’m in the extremely overweight category, working toward losing 60 pounds over a 6-month period. I’m now less than a month away from finishing the most intense phase.

To be transparent, my doctor doesn’t see my current approach as ideal for long-term sustainability—but he’s signed off on it for this specific timeframe as long as I follow his guidance and stay consistent. So far, it’s working.

Current eating window:

Starts with a Honeycrisp apple + 2 cups of coffee before work.

About 3 hours later: a protein bar.

Near the end of the window: a compact, calorie-dense burrito (it’s my way of meeting the rest of my caloric needs while still at work).

Micronutrients are covered by supplements.


My question:

Has anyone here tried moving their heaviest meal to the middle of the eating window instead of the end?
I’m wondering if there are noticeable effects on metabolism, satiety, energy levels, or even mental focus. I’m not looking to overhaul the whole system—just fine-tune the timing.

Quick note to clarify:

I know this kind of aggressive diet isn’t generally advised long-term. My doctor and I are both aware of that. But for now, it’s a temporary and tightly managed solution. I’ve also made permanent lifestyle changes to back it up—because I’m not interested in going backwards, and frankly, my life depends on it.

* Transforming breakrooms into passive income streams for businesses
* Deploying adaptive snack tech that learns preferences and optimizes selections(it will stock what your team craves)
* Scaling fast with our permission-less model—no red tape, just smart snacking
* Are you tired of your break room vending machine judging you silently as you buy your third bag of Cheetos at 3 PM? Upgrade to an AI Vending Machine—the only snack dispenser that actively judges you (with love). Out of coffee? It’ll dispense a cup and sarcastically ask if you’re okay.

Here’s how it works:

* Zero cost to you—just provide power & internet.

my father has been using simple filter coffee machines, with a water tank, a thermo pot and a tray for paper filters, made entirely from plastic, for decades now. See the pictures attached.

He won't change his habits and switch to a different type of coffee or coffee machine at this point. He drinks coffee daily, so I would like to provide a drop-in replacement for his current setup, made from stainless steel, where the hot, boiling water doesn't flow through plastic, like it currently does. So far, I haven't been able to find a replacement model.

Does anyone know a brand that offers a model with a similar form-factor (water tank, thermo pot, paper filter tray), made from stainless steel? It's fine if the outside casing, which doesn't come in contact with the coffee/boiling water, is made from plastic.

After the accident, I was grateful my daughter still spoke as if her father was reading her a bed time story every night before bed. I should have really stopped telling her that Daddy's never coming home.

I should have listened when Emma first whispered to empty corners. Should have paid attention when she giggled at jokes no one told. Three weeks since the funeral, and my six-year-old sits cross-legged on her bedroom carpet, chatting with the space where her toy chest meets the wall.

""Tell Mommy I miss her pancakes,"" she says to the air.

My breath stops. Emma hasn't mentioned pancakes since the accident. Never asked me to make them. But she recites details I never shared, his favorite coffee mug, the song he hummed while shaving, how he checked the locks twice every night.

The therapist calls it processing. I call it breaking my heart.

Tonight Emma giggles at something unheard, then looks past me toward the doorway.

""Daddy says Mommy looks tired. He wants to tuck her in too.""

Cold spreads across my shoulders like fingers trailing down my spine. The thermostat reads seventy-four. My skin prickles with frost.

In the kitchen, I pour wine with shaking hands. The bottle chatters against glass. Photographs on the refrigerator flutter though no windows open, no fans run.

Emma appears in the doorway, already in pajamas.

""Daddy says you're not eating enough.""

My wine glass slips. Red spreads across white tiles like the stain they never got out of his car seat.

""Sweetheart, Daddy can't..""

""He's right behind you.""

The cold intensifies. My spine stiffens, every vertebra popping as I refuse to turn. Emma's eyes track movement past my shoulder.

""He says he loves you. He says he's sorry about the rain that night.""

I never told Emma about the rain. Never mentioned how the wipers couldn't keep up, how the truck ran the red light, how his last words were my name.

Emma reaches past me toward empty space.

""Daddy wants to hold your hand.""

My wedding ring burns like ice. The kitchen light flickers. Emma smiles at something behind me.

""He says he's been trying to tell you something important.""

Cold wraps around my wrist like phantom fingers. Emma nods at the presence I refuse to acknowledge.

""He says he's never leaving home.""

My throat constricts as temperature plummets. Emma's breath mists in the suddenly arctic air. She extends her small hand toward me.

When she messages DH, she doesn't ask to see all three of us, just the two of them.

It's not like it's a big deal or anything, just casual coffees or walks, but today she knows we're both free and I could easily join if I wanted to. DH wouldn't mind, it's more the invitations to him only asking to see him and DD that grate on me slightly. What really gets me is that it feels like she's cutting me out from my own family by inviting DH and DD without including me. I just wonder why she doesn't say 'would be lovely to see you all'. It makes me feel like I'm not part of the family activities she's planning, even though I'm DD's mom.

u/[deleted]:

I'm new here and have a question.  

Is it porn that is the problem or is it jacking off? I have been jacking off with porn 2-3 times a day for the last 2 years. I have never had any problems because of it. But all these studies have made me rethink my relation with porn.  

However, whenever I go for a while without jacking off, vacation, camping, etc., I find myself to be very unhappy. All I think about is sex and it really gets on my nerves. I stop being my normal confident, funny and not afraid to talk to girls self. I become sad and scared of women.  
 
Is it ok to just cut porn out of my life and only jack off once a day?

---

-u/stickwithit4life replied:

Is it porn that is the problem or is it jacking off?  
  
Both. Porn releases immense amounts of dopamine (that high you get when you watch a scene you like), dopamine is the reward chemical. In a normal human being, many things you do cause the release of small amounts of dopamine (ie working towards goals, achieving things.. even taking a dump releases dopamine).  
  
Now, when you constantly watch porn, with all novel and unique persons etc, you are in a constant ""high"" that all other activities (that release much much less dopamine) become painfully boring, hence wankers are passive people who don't take action. Their minds are tricked into thinking they are mating daily when in fact it's all a sad illusion that is literally self-destructive.  

I have never had any problems because of it.  

So you think, imagine a human being that is numbed down as soon as he becomes self-aware, they will never realize what the real human experience is, because they are in a constant state of numbness. Abstain completely for at least 2 weeks and you will slowly see tangible differences, by 3 months it will be clear as day.  

However, whenever I go for a while without jacking off, vacation, camping, etc., I find myself to be very unhappy. All I think about is sex and it really gets on my nerves.  

Because as a man, your penis is not just another organ, it's literally what makes you a man (male hormones are cooked in your balls), that energy NEEDS a physical release of some sort—running, working out, doing physically demanding work. We were built to be protectors and hunters, but modern life makes us inactive. The energy builds up unused and becomes overwhelming, hence you are uneasy and you fap yourself into numbness, not knowing you are wasting your very own essence, that life juice that makes you a man.  

Is it ok to just cut porn out of my life and only jack off once a day?  
 
If you do, you will reduce the damage by avoiding the dopamine high I explained above, but Semen Retention has enormous benefits. To experience a truly life-transforming change that will make you a ""believer"", do both: stop PMO (that's Porn, Masturbation, Orgasm).

u/[deleted] replied:

I would describe my life as very happy. I don't feel numb at all. All my relationships are full and rewarding. I wake up every morning and feel happy and ready to go. I feel strong and confident. I never feel sad or empty after porn use. I never feel like I have to use porn, I don't think about it when I'm not using it. It feels like a cup of coffee in the morning, just part of my day. My life is the best it has ever been.  

I guess I'm not like the ""typical"" person that comes to this sub, as I came here because I saw the negative effects of porn use from studies, not because I was feeling any negative effects.

u/stickwithit4life responded again:

Like I said, you never know what it's like because you never experienced it without. If it's such an ""easy, no big deal"" thing, then stop cold turkey now. You'll see how hooked you are once you do.  
 
Think of it like this: some guy eats bare minimum junk food all his life.. you ask him to run around a track, he stops after 2 laps.. he tells you that's all he can do, even with good sleep and all.  
 
Now someone comes in, forces him to eat healthy food, his body reaches its true potential, then you ask him to run the track again he goes 4 laps then gets tired..  
 
Imagine his surprise, to know that he could actually do that... if only he stopped taking all that junk.  
 
But hey, whatever works for you man.

Kamakailan, naging usap-usapan sa social media ang TikTok video ni Euleen Castro kung saan ibinahagi niya ang kanyang negatibong karanasan sa Coffeebreak, isang kilalang café chain sa Iloilo. Sa naturang video, binanggit ni Castro na wala siyang natikmang masarap sa kanilang in-order na pagkain at inumin, na may kasamang pagmumura at matinding pagkadismaya. Ang kanyang komento ay umani ng iba't ibang reaksyon mula sa publiko, kabilang na ang mga tagasuporta ng café at iba pang netizens.

Bilang tugon, naglabas ng opisyal na pahayag ang Coffeebreak sa kanilang Facebook page. Sa kanilang mensahe, inamin nila na ikinalungkot nila ang naranasang hindi magandang karanasan ni Castro. Gayunpaman, binigyang-diin nila na ang panlasa ay isang personal na bagay at maaaring magkaiba-iba sa bawat tao. Hinimok din nila ang publiko na magbigay ng feedback sa maayos at magalang na paraan upang mapabuti pa nila ang kanilang serbisyo at produkto.

Samantala, ipinagtanggol ni Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas ang lokal na café laban sa mga negatibong komento ni Castro.

anyway, earlier yesterday I started my day taking aleeve to help with joint pain, not realizing I shouldn’t take that with prednisone.

i woke up out of deep sleep at 240 am with burning sensation in my chest, increased heart rate and i vomited my food from the evening, and then came the dark red blood, and then the darker brownish red color. i had vomited what appeared to be coffee grounds back in February and was told at hospital it wasn’t anything to be worried about.

i am at ER now, have been here since 345 and it’s almost 7. they’re saying they probably won’t be seeing me for another 3-4 hours.

I have been feeling weak, fatigued, overall not much like myself at all. the burning sensation in my chest has started to go away and come back intermittently. my feet are falling asleep.

I overall feel better than I did when I originally came here but I don’t know if I should continue waiting if I’m just going to be told it isn’t a big deal again. What I felt was so scary but it doesn’t feel like an emergency anymore.

1kxe9qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kxe9qm/does_stahomily_st1_water_filter_deliver_reliable/,Does Stahomily ST1 Water Filter Deliver Reliable Performance? Honest Review Inside!,"The **Stahomily ST1** water filter replacement is one of those products you use daily yet rarely stop to appreciate – until it impresses you by doing its job exceptionally well. This filter is specifically designed as a replacement for Whirlpool’s EDR1RXD1 Everydrop Filter 1 and boasts compatibility with a wide range of refrigerator models. My fridge, which happens to be one of the compatible models, was crying out for cleaner, better-tasting water, and I decided to give this filter a whirl. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much beyond the basics, but the results were eye-opening.

**Design and Compatibility**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this replacement filter was its compact build. With dimensions of 2.7 x 2.7 x 8.7 inches, it slid into my Whirlpool refrigerator with a snug fit. There's a reassuring ""click"" when it locks into place, giving you confidence that it’s secure. What caught my attention was the coconut shell carbon block as its core material—imported from Sri Lanka, no less! It has a clever design optimized to maintain water flow while effectively filtering out impurities. I found the list of compatible refrigerators incredibly exhaustive, ranging from Whirlpool models like GSS26C4XXB to KitchenAid units such as KFFS20EYMS. Installing it took less than five minutes, even though I’m not particularly handy with appliances.

**Check [Stahomily ST1] price on Amazon.**

**Filtration Performance**  
Once installed, I ran water through the dispenser for five minutes as advised, just to flush out any initial carbon dust. The change in taste was almost immediate. This filter is certified by NSF 42, meaning it significantly reduces chlorine, odor, and other suspended particles. My home’s tap water always had a slight chemical tang, and this completely eliminated that unpleasant aftertaste. I also liked that it retains beneficial minerals because not every filter strikes that balance. After using it for several weeks, I can safely say the water tastes incredibly clean and crisp – my coffee, tea, and even baby formula have benefited from it.

**Merits**  
- The installation process is genuinely easy, even for folks who aren't tech-savvy.  
- The coconut carbon material is highly effective in removing chlorine and odors.  
- NSF 42 certification offers peace of mind for filtration standards.  
- No leaks! The top sealing ring ensures a consistent, mess-free experience.  

**Steady Durability and Minimum Maintenance**  
Durability in a water filter may seem like a given, but many struggle with pressure or leakage issues over time. Not this one. It’s tested for 400 PSI burst pressure and 100,000 water hammer cycles, so it’s built to last. As a family that goes through a lot of filtered water daily, we’ve not experienced a single hiccup. The filter is rated for six months or roughly 200 gallons, depending on usage, and I appreciate the clear performance window that avoids surprises.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The lack of an indicator or built-in reminder system for filter replacement can be inconvenient.
- It doesn’t filter out some advanced contaminants like heavy metals.  
- While installation is simple, the flushing process can drip messily if you’re not careful.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
There’s no shortage of water filter replacements on the market, but the **Stahomily ST1** holds its ground in many key areas. Take the Everydrop Filter 1 by Whirlpool, for instance. While the original performs slightly better at removing advanced contaminants like lead, it's significantly more expensive and doesn’t always justify the premium. Meanwhile, budget brands may be cheaper than Stahomily but often lack proper certifications like NSF 42. If you’re aiming for affordability without compromising on basic filtration performance, this filter strongly shines.  

**Affordable Quality**  
This is where I did a lot of thinking. If you’ve ever used official OEM water filters, you already know the hefty premiums they often come with. The **Stahomily ST1** does exactly what the original filter promises but at a far more wallet-friendly rate. It strikes a fantastic balance between price and quality, delivering a filter that feels well worth the cost. While there could be minor criticisms about its advanced filtration capabilities, those are only relevant for users with highly specific water concerns.

1kxe8up,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1kxe8up/what_4_months_of_solo_saas_building_taught_me_the/,What 4 months of solo SaaS building taught me (the hard way),"I’ve been lurking here for a while and finally decided to share something of my own. I launched a SaaS boilerplate a few months ago that I built entirely solo — and honestly, it turned out to be way tougher than I expected... but also surprisingly addictive.

Started this whole thing because I was tired of setting up the same auth flows, payment integrations, and dashboard templates for every new project. Thought I'd build something for myself and maybe sell a few copies on the side. 4 months later and I'm basically running a mini business lol.

Here's the stuff that actually mattered:

**Stop polishing, start shipping**

Wasted 3 weeks building the 'perfect' payment flow - every edge case covered, super polished. Result? Nobody signed up. Now I ship messy MVPs and let actual users tell me what sucks. Works way better. Those startup books(Lean startup, Rework) weren't lying after all.

**Marketing might be more important than your code**

This one hurt to learn. I'm a developer - I thought if I built something amazing, people would just find it and love it. Spent 4 months perfecting features while doing zero marketing. Launch day came and... crickets. Literally had 3 signups in the first week and two were my friends...

Had to completely flip my priorities. Now I spend almost as much time on marketing as coding. Writing posts, engaging on Twitter, actually talking to potential users, building in public. The crazy part? My mediocre v1 with good marketing performed way better than my ""perfect"" v0 with no marketing. Code doesn't sell itself - you have to.

**Burnout hits different when you're solo**

Nobody talks about this enough - working on your own project is weirdly more exhausting than a regular job. There's no ""end of workday"" when everything is your responsibility. I'd code until 2am, wake up thinking about feature requests, check analytics during dinner. My girlfriend literally had to hide my laptop one weekend.

The breaking point was when I spent 3 straight days debugging a payment issue and realized I hadn't left my apartment or talked to another human. Had to force myself to set actual boundaries - no code after 8pm, weekends are for recharging, and I started working from coffee shops just to be around people. Sounds obvious but when you're grinding solo, it's easy to forget you're still human.

**Solo dev life is basically controlled chaos**

One minute you're debugging a payment webhook, next you're writing documentation, then you're answering support emails, then design, then something else. I had to literally block out time for each thing or I'd just code all day and ignore everything else. Tip: set boundaries with yourself or you'll burn out.

**Document everything (even if you hate it)**

I'm terrible at writing docs but forced myself to do it anyway. Came back to my code after a 2-week break and was so glad I left detailed comments and setup instructions. Your future self will thank you, and so will your users.

**Pricing is weird and personal**

Pricing is such a strange process. I went back and forth for months before finally choosing something that felt fair for the time it saves. What I’ve learned: it’s less about picking the “right” number and more about believing in the value you’re offering. Still adjusting based on feedback, but at least I stopped overthinking.

**Have a runway or you'll make desperate decisions**

I had around two years of savings before I started, and honestly, I can’t imagine doing this while stressing about rent. That financial buffer gave me the freedom to focus on building something meaningful instead of scrambling for quick wins. I think even 6 months of runway can be enough for many - but I tend to overprepare and worry a lot.

**Use tech you actually like**

Use tech you actually enjoy working with. I started with Nuxt and Supabase - tools I know well and actually *like* using - and it made all the difference. Progress felt natural, even after writing thousands of lines of code. When you enjoy the stack, building doesn’t feel like a grind. Choose tools that help you ship, not just ones that look cool to other devs or just trending.

  
**Not Everyone Online Is Toxic: Criticism Came First, Support Followed**

The internet can feel brutal sometimes - lots of noise, unsolicited opinions, and people ready to tear you down. When I first shared my project, I got plenty of criticism. Some of it was harsh, some fair, but it definitely made me second-guess myself.

Still, I pushed through and kept building. And along the way, I started hearing from people who actually *got it -* those who found it useful, gave thoughtful feedback, or just encouraged me to keep going. It reminded me that yeah, there are plenty of negative voices online, but there are also genuinely good people who want to see you succeed.

Don’t let the loudest critics drown out the ones who care. Keep building.

**The weirdest part? I actually love it**

Yeah, it’s stressful, and I make way less money than at my old job — plus I actually work more hours now. But there’s something about building something from scratch and seeing people actually use it that’s incredibly satisfying. Even when it gets frustrating, I’d still rather be doing this than sitting in another planning meeting.

Not trying to sell anything here - just wanted to share the reality of going solo since I know a lot of people think about it. Happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side or business stuff.

1kxe72f,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuarterLifeClarity/comments/1kxe72f/wednesday_encouragement_10_years_from_now/,Wednesday Encouragement - 10 Years From Now,"I came across this TikTok yesterday and it’s been sitting with me… here’s what it said:

“Imagine 10 years from now. It's a spring Saturday morning in 2035.

You're standing in the yard of the house you bought in 2034, humming a song from a 2033 album, by your favorite band who you found out about in 2032, waiting for the dog you got in 2031 to finish doing their business, while wearing your comfiest pajama pants. A birthday gift you received in 2030 from a friend you met in 2029.

You’re planning to spend the afternoon gardening, a hobby you picked up in 2028. Later, you might rewatch a movie you love. The one that won best picture in 2027. Inside, someone you met in 2026 is making pancakes.

All because your world didn't end in 2025.”

[https://www.TikTok.com/t/ZP8M269hr/](https://www.TikTok.com/t/ZP8M269hr/)



I think sometimes we go around with a microscope view on things. We look at our life through a zoomed in lens, and if things aren’t going the way we think they should (which, let’s be honest, these days they might not be), we hit the panic button.

We stress ourselves out by overthinking every little detail, and suddenly we’re in a pit of despair, losing hope for the future, feeling like things will never change.

But this story? It reminded me that we all still have so much left of our story. That time has a way of revealing *and* healing us. And that the unknown of the future is something to be excited about.



At the same time, none of these things mentioned in the story just happened overnight.

That house you bought? It took years of searching, getting outbid, and a year of painful renovations.

That friend who gave you those pajamas? You probably wouldn’t be that close with them if you hadn’t opened up about that struggle you were facing.

That person inside making pancakes? The one who turned your house into a home? They might not be there if you didn’t muster up 20 seconds of courage to ask them for coffee.



See, we all want these things. And I truly believe we can and will have them someday. But it takes hope. It takes belief. It takes reminders, like this one, that it’s okay to slow down, to breathe, to realize that the best things in life take time.

It’s about zooming out, throwing away the microscope, and realizing we’re literally just getting started. Let’s not fall into the trap of trying to win the whole game in the first quarter.



So to sum it up— that “zoom out” mindset, coupled with the small, brave steps we take today—like opening Zillow for the 87th time, being vulnerable with a friend, or even just saying hi to a stranger—that’s what will get us there.

That’s my hope for you on this Wednesday. You’re not stuck. You’re not behind. Your world isn't ending. You’re just building your story... and that takes time.

If you have any of your own thoughts on this, I’d love to hear them in the comments below. Otherwise, thanks for being here now go have a day!

1kxe6sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1kxe6sg/afib_episodes_in_a_digestive_context_triggers/,Afib episodes in a digestive context - Triggers learned along the way,"After an overview of my situation, I'd like to ask anyone with similar patterns to share their insights. I'm giving details because I'm hoping some can relate. I'm also putting the name of the countries where I was for conclusions on the local healthcare approaches.

I'm a 40+ vegetarian and I've had 5 episodes of Paroxystic Afib in the past 18 years, but the last three have been in the past year. All episodes resolved within 24 hours with medication, the first one with Digoxin , the last 4 with flecainide + bisoprolol combination. No atrial remodeling at present.

What changed in this last year particularly?

\-I begun a more intense cardio workout at the gym

\-I took amino-acids, then replaced with protein shakes, then replaced with protein-rich yogurts

\-I had gone through a stressful period where I have to be away from my family for two years (working abroad), with occasional visits

All my episodes happened between 22:00 and 05:00, and they all had a digestive component (some also having a sleep deprivation aspect) as such:

**First episode, 2006 (as a student, Romania):**

Context:

\-sleep deprivation (2 nights spent travelling by night train)

\-evening of the episode, had coffee + whiskey shot + smoked one cigarette + fast food meal, then went to the disco (smoking allowed inside), felt someting change in my chest when I climbed the stairs to get out 

\-went to the emergency room only the next morning, they gave me a shot of Digoxin and the rhythm normalised

Conclusion at that time: it was because of the whiskey, coffee, smoking combo -- sleep deprivation didn't register for me

**Second episode, 2013 (working man, Belgium)**

Context:

\-some accumulated sleep deprivation, due to staying up late binge watching series and having to get up early

\-evening of the episode: had a very big restaurant meal, work event thing, including an extremely sweet and chocolatty *moelleux au chocolat*  for dessert. No alcohol. No smoking. At around 23 I left, very bloated. It was -10 Celsius outside and I was not dressed for that temperature so I sprinted to my car while shiverring. Drove for 10 minutes, arrived home and felt the afib coming in the elevator.

\-went to emergency room, episode resolved within 24 hours with Flecainide IV + bisoprolol. I was sent home after a sports test and told to take 5 more days of flecainide + bisoprolol

\-Conclusion at that time: it was because of the big meal bloating + running while shiverring 

  
**Third episode, June 2023 (Romania)**

\-context: I had begun taking essential amino-acids and going to the gym 2 months prior, I had already experienced some skipped beats, didn't identify the source; also, sleep deprivation due to travelling from Belgium to Romania and the plane was late; I arrived home at 4 AM; large pesto mozzarella sandwhich at 3 AM before going to sleep. I fell asleep on my stomach, my usual sleeping position (until then)

\-woke up at 6 AM with afib, used the protocol the cardiologist from the 2013 episode recommended: 5 mg Bisoprolol, wait 1 hour, then flecainide (he had recommended slow-release kind 150 mg one per 24h, but they didn't have it in Romania so I took 100 mg normal flecainide and took another one for the night). I also took anticoagulants right from the start.

\-I went to emergency room in Romania but they said since I had already began my treatment, let it work itself out, they didn't have flecainide IV only amiodarone but I shouldn't mix anti-arrythmics (she was saying that the span of one episode could go up to 7 days, as long as I take the anticoagulant I'm protected; she also said something prophetic -- you will see, once your rhythm goes below 60 it will be resolved). 

\-Indeed, next morning (so in 24h), I woke up in normal rhythm

**Fourth episode, 18 April 2024 (Romania)**

Context:

\-a whole year of intensive cardio, but mid-way throughout 2023, after changing from amino-acids to protein and still getting skipped beats, then changing to protein drinkable yogurts and still getting them, clearly after these drinks, I started to do some research and discovered they all contain sucralose, an artificial sweetener which is associated with palpitations -- apparently because the digestive system interprets the sweetness of sucralose as actual sugar and starts doing stuff to counter the sugar but there's actually no glucose there so the system overreacts (I guess a doctor could explain this better). 

\-from those episodes of skipped beats and upper stomach / lower esophagus discomfort, I saw a change in my upper digestive system, more bloating than usual, a kind of perpetual lump in my throat -- my conclusion is that experimenting with these substances for a few months left some residual sensitivity in my organism to this day

\-3 weeks before the episode: irritated my stomach/esophagus by eating two tuna cans with lemon juice (stupidly, since I had been a vegetarian for 13 years but I just didn't want to throw these away). Experienced skipped beats for 20 minutes and then occasionally for the next week (in slouching type positions). 

\-evenining of the episode: ate 4 loaves of beans spread with tomato past, 3 hours later, while bloated, laying down on my stomach before going to sleep I felt the afib directly

\-I took the usual bisoprolol + flecainide, it went away in 17 hours

Conclusion at that time: it was the beans spread bloating + laying on my stomach + 3 weeks before irritation of esophagus/upper stomach

Fifth episode 2 May (Belgium)

Context:

\-there is already the general context that within 2 weeks of one episode the atrium is still very sensitive to having another episode 

\-two days before an episode I had a margherita pizza at 18:00 with spicy olive oil and a cherry beer -- I thought it was alcohol free but it wasn't -- immediately after walking away from the restaurant I felt skipped beats which resolved in about 30 minutes after a lot of belching.

\-the day of the episode at around 18:00 I had 500 ml of kefir with oats + handful of blueberries and about 10 large strawberries; I went to sleep at 00:00 with a feeling of a lump, I was afraid and took a packet of minty anti-acid gel (later I found out the mint relaxes the esophagean sphicter + it also contains artificial sweetners)

\-woke up at 1:00 AM with afib, took my regular bisoprolol + flecainide and it resolved in 15hours

Conclusion: It could have been the bloating or the antiacid gel???

My next step is to talk to a gastro-enterologist about some imaging possibly to be done to the esophagus/stomach. I also scheduled an appointment with a PFA ablation cardiologist at a reputable centre in Belgium to explore if this is recommended for my context and what it would entail.

I leave you with this question: Have you had afib in a digestive trigger context or sleep deprivation context and how quickly did it resolve?",3,1748430104.0,AFIB,4,1.0,False

Hey there! My name is Brad, and I am 36/m from the US. I am looking for some new long-term friends to get to know and to develop someone to chat with daily. I am looking for someone to chat with throughout the day, send memes to, vent to, listen to you vent, and do whatever else. I also love voice calls and sending voice notes.

A little bit about me, I live alone with two cats and work from home as well. I enjoy playing video games, watching sports, going to the gym, listening to music, playing guitar, love coffee, watching tv shows/movies and I love taking naps.

If you are interested in chatting and getting to know each other, feel free to send me a chat with a little introduction about yourself. I eventually would want to switch to Discord or something, as Reddit chat can be a pain. I hope to hear from you soon!",1,1748430020.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1kxe1rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1kxe1rg/poesie_reviews_tenth_birthday_collection/,poesie reviews: tenth birthday collection,"hi y’all—it’s been way too long since I’ve posted on here! the folks over at poesie were kind enough to send over their newest collection, and I’ve been testing them out over the last couple of weeks.

a brief reminder of my preferences & rating system:

**rating system:**

0/5 - scrubber. get this off of me immediately. 

1/5 - would never repurchase, but might wear it once or twice.

2/5 - not my usual style, but not awful. will definitely be someone's cup of tea.

3/5 - something I'll definitely reach for, but I may have something similar to it or only wear it in one season. low FS potential, but I’ll enjoy my sample.

4/5 - very enjoyable, would consider a FS. 

5/5 - will almost certainly FS (repeatedly).

**preferences:** I’m a collector and have a wide taste range, but I usually reach for something green or fresh on the daily. I don't tend to enjoy heady florals, strong patchouli, or anise, and I’m generally picky with heavily spiced or smoky scents due to my skin chemistry. my skin is also generally funky with a few specific notes: clove, carrot, and most lactonic accords. 


***and now, on to the reviews!***


**yellow cake** *(vanilla, butter, and custard):*
this is a freebie in all of their birthday discovery sets at the moment, and it’s honestly delicious. it smells like true-to-life yellow box cake, topped with a generous amount of funfetti frosting. it’s sweet enough to give you a little bit of a toothache, but nostalgic and fun. **3/5**

**emma** *(white cake layered with strawberry jam and juicy fresh strawberries and whipped cream):*
I love strawberry shortcake scents, don’t get me wrong (I have tried a lot of them), I just think this is an…artistic representation of it. my personal preference with gourmands is that they smell like you set a plate of *whatever-the-thing-is* right in front of my nose. this, however, is not that. it’s a pretty, perfume-y rendition of strawberry shortcake, which is perfectly fine. there’s some tartness here, and I like that. I just prefer a photorealistic gourmand, for which I would recommend **preposterous from nui nobalt** - it’s one of the best shortcake scents I’ve tried. **2.5/5**

**anne** *(carrot cake with cinnamon and pecans and cream cheese frosting):*
yeah, this is a fantastic rendition of carrot cake. and honestly, bonus points for having two notes that tend to go weird on my skin and still being delicious! this is well-balanced and appropriately spiced. each aspect is distinguishable, which I also really appreciate. I’d say it’s probably best for cooler weather. I’m very happy with this scent for what it is, and it’s my second favorite from the collection. **3.5/5**

**scout** *(white cake layered with candied cherries and caramelized coconut pecan frosting, and soaked in bourbon):*
the cherry opening in this smells like **you tempt me**, which has long since been a favorite of mine. unfortunately, that does die down pretty quickly for me. the coconut pecan situation does smell a bit like german chocolate frosting, which is a win for me! I’m also getting something a tad bready from this, which isn’t a bad thing but is definitely different from the rest of the collection. overall, I think it’s pretty, but not something I’ll reach for often. **2.5/5**

**matilda** *(fudgy chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting, coffee, royal sandalwood, amber):*
I fear that I’m in the minority here, but this is my least favorite. it *is* distinctly fudgy, and points to poesie for that, but it is also the least gourmand. it isn’t listed, but I swear I’m picking up patchouli in this one. it’s definitely the most earthy of the bunch, which does work out well if you’re not as much of a gourmand person. it’s not bad, it’s just not what I hoped for. **2/5**

**juliet** *(cardamom pistachio olive oil cake with lemon vanilla glaze):*
oh, poesie, how your cardamom perfumes are always incredible. I saved the best for last here - I fell in love with this immediately. the lemon glaze is incredibly realistic, I can practically taste it. I love the slight savory aspect from the olive oil, and the nutty/spiced tones in this are really well balanced. this is exactly what I wanted from a cake perfume, and it’s the standout from the collection in my opinion. **4/5**

overall, I think this was a really lovely collection. I’m interested to hear your thoughts if you’ve picked this up or are planning to!!

One popular solution in cosmetic dentistry is [composite bonding](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding). It’s a quick, painless, and **cost-effective alternative to** [veneers ](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/veneers)that’s become *super* popular here in London. For those unfamiliar, composite bonding (aka *dental bonding*) involves applying a tooth-colored resin to your teeth to repair minor flaws and enhance your smile’s appearance. The best part? It often only takes **one visit** to the dentist, so you can walk out with a refreshed smile in no time!

**What Makes Composite Bonding Awesome?** Here are some key benefits that have Londoners raving about this treatment:

* **Quick Results (One-Visit Smile Upgrade):** The whole process is usually done in a single appointment, often in under an hour. Perfect for busy schedules – you could literally get a tooth fixed on your lunch break. Instant gratification!
* **Painless & Non-Invasive:** No drills, no needles (in most cases). The dentist just lightly preps the tooth surface and adds the resin. It’s generally **painless**, so if dental work makes you nervous, bonding is pretty stress-free. Plus, since there’s minimal to no enamel removal, your natural tooth stays intact.
* **Affordable Alternative to Veneers:** Want the aesthetic boost of veneers but not the hefty price tag? Composite bonding is **much more budget-friendly**. You get similar cosmetic improvements (covering discoloration, smoothing chips, closing small gaps) at a fraction of the cost of porcelain veneers. **Bonus:** It’s reversible, unlike veneers which permanently alter your teeth.
* **Fixes Chips, Gaps & Other Flaws:** Bonding is super versatile. It can repair a chipped tooth, fill in a slight gap between teeth, mask small cracks or spots, and even make a slightly crooked tooth look straighter. It’s basically a cosmetic touch-up that can make your teeth look more even and bright.
* **Boosts Smile Aesthetics (and Confidence):** By improving tooth shape and color, composite bonding can dramatically enhance your smile’s appearance. Many patients say it gives them a **big confidence boost** – you’ll find yourself smiling more when you’re not worried about that one annoying chip or uneven tooth! 🎉

**Why** ***London*** **Loves Composite Bonding:** Aside from the benefits above, composite bonding fits the London vibe perfectly. It’s **quick, effective, and readily available** at many cosmetic dental clinics here (including ours at [Dental Art Implant Clinic](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding)). We’ve seen first-hand how a bit of bonding can transform someone’s smile *in one day*. In a city where everyone’s busy and quality matters, this treatment has become a go-to for a subtle but impactful smile makeover. And yes, it’s great for that tea or coffee staining habit – bonding can cover up discoloration and give you a fresh start (just remember to still go easy on the lattes to keep it looking its best! 😉).

**Let’s Chat!** Have you had any experience with composite bonding or other cosmetic dental work in London? **What do you think of it?** If you’re curious or have questions about how composite bonding works, what it costs around here, or whether it’s the right fix for your teeth – ask away in the comments! 💬 As dental professionals, we’re happy to share honest advice and info. Whether you’re contemplating a minor tweak or just love learning about dental stuff, we’d love to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.

This is NOT MY STORY it is my friends but she doesn't have reddit so she asked me to post it. She texted me everything below so its in her POV not mine or 3rd person wtvr. She genuinely wants to know if she is TA. I even told her to write it as if she was writing a post.



Okay, this might sound petty, but I feel like I did the right thing, even if everyone’s giving me side-eye for it. I (19F) have a cousin, “Sarah” (20F), and we’re pretty close. We’ve always gotten along really well, but she’s also a bit of a troublemaker, and sometimes I feel like she crosses boundaries without thinking about it.

So, I had a serious relationship with my ex, “Ryan” (21M), for about a year. We broke up in January. It was hard, but we both moved on. At least, I thought we did. I never really thought much about him after we ended things—he’s a nice guy, but I wasn’t in love with him anymore. I started focusing on myself and hanging out with friends, especially Sarah, who I always considered to be one of my best friends.

About a month ago, I noticed Sarah and Ryan were acting kind of weird around me. They were both being unusually secretive, and whenever I’d ask what they were doing, they’d act like I was overreacting. I didn’t think too much about it at first, but I started feeling like something was off.

Then last week, I ran into a friend who mentioned, “Hey, I saw Ryan and Sarah out together. They looked really cozy.” And that’s when I started putting two and two together. I asked Sarah about it, and she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. But the next day, I saw them both at a coffee shop, sitting way too close together, laughing like they were on a date.

I was honestly in shock. It didn’t make sense to me—Sarah knew how hard I worked to get over Ryan, and for her to keep this from me was... well, it felt like betrayal.

So, I confronted her. I told her I knew about her and Ryan, and I asked her straight up how long it had been going on. She hesitated at first, then admitted they’d been secretly dating for three months. She said they didn’t want to hurt me, but to be honest, it hurt more that they lied about it. They had been hiding their relationship behind my back, knowing how much it would upset me.

I didn’t yell at her or make a scene, but I told her I felt completely blindsided and betrayed. She apologized, said she was sorry for not telling me sooner, but I was still really upset. I told her it wasn’t that I was mad about them being together—it was that they kept it a secret and lied about it. It made me feel like I couldn’t trust her anymore.

We haven’t talked much since, but now my family is divided. Some of them say I was being too harsh, and I should’ve just accepted it because “it’s not like they were doing anything wrong,” but others say I was right to stand up for myself and call out the betrayal.

So, AITA for confronting my cousin about secretly dating my ex for months? I feel like I was just standing up for my own feelings, but now the whole family is acting weird around me.",3,1748429251.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

Dough Coffee and Kitchen opened earlier this month on Whitley Road and is already a hit with locals. 

A new café is bringing an all-day brunch experience to Whitley Bay. Dough Coffee house and Kitchen opened earlier this month inside the former HSBC bank building on Whitley Road, transforming the space into a bright and inviting spot already proving a hit with locals.

Serving up a scrumptious home made all-day brunch and breakfast menu, dishes include the full English breakfast, sourdough sarnies and Brioche French Toast. Diners can also enjoy an extensive range of gluten free and vegan menu items available, whilst delicious freshly made bakes such as stuffed cookies, cake slices and fruit scones are on offer from the sweet treat cabinet.

The Whitley Bay café serves a range of summery drinks including popular matcha in 'Plain Jane' and white chocolate and raspberry flavours, a 'sunshine in a cup' strawberry cooler as well as the classic flat white or dirty chai latte.

	•	Week 2: Koh Lanta
	•	Week 3: Koh Phi Phi Don
	•	Week 4: Back to Phuket — we’re playing it by ear and booking as we go 🧳✌️

We’re super excited to soak in the culture, nature, and all the delicious Thai food — but we also thought it’d be fun (and honestly, helpful!) to connect with other traveling families who might be in the area around the same time.

1kxdv9o,https://youtu.be/W_IE92M5o_0,3 Very Scary TRUE Trucker Accidents Horror Stories,"# ""Dead Man’s Curve"":

I’ve been a truck driver for 22 years, crisscrossing the country with loads of everything from frozen vegetables to construction equipment. I’ve driven through storms that shook my rig, dodged deer that darted across highways, and dealt with breakdowns in the middle of nowhere. I thought I knew fear, but nothing prepared me for that night on a lonely state highway, a night that still haunts me every time I grip the wheel.I was hauling a Caterpillar D-9 bulldozer, a hulking machine that weighed over 100,000 pounds. My rig was a 1987 Freightliner, reliable but worn, with a flatbed trailer that groaned under the dozer’s weight. The oversized load banners flapped against the treads, and I had to keep my speed low to stop the trailer from swaying. The CB radio was my lifeline to other drivers, but that night it was acting up, spitting static and half-heard words. I’d meant to get it fixed at the last stop, but time was tight, and I figured I could manage. Big mistake.I was on a two-lane state route, a stretch known for its bad curves and worse accidents. At a truck stop earlier that day, I’d overheard a couple of drivers talking about it over coffee. One, a wiry guy with a faded ball cap, leaned across the counter and said, “Watch yourself on 17, ‘round Dead Man’s Curve. Ice gets bad there, and the county don’t salt it enough.”“Dead Man’s Curve?” I asked, stirring my coffee, half-listening.“Yeah,” he said, lowering his voice. “Lost a buddy there two winters ago. Trailer jackknifed, took out a minivan. Mess you don’t forget.” His buddy, a heavyset driver with a toothpick in his mouth, nodded grimly. “They need to fix that road,” he added. “Too many wrecks.”I shrugged it off. I’d driven worse roads, and I wasn’t hauling anything that could tip easy. But their words stuck with me as I climbed back into the cab, the engine rumbling to life.Now, hours later, I was nearing that curve. The CB crackled, and I caught fragments of a conversation. “Wreck… mile marker 42… traffic stopped…” The signal faded into static before I could hear more. I turned the dial, trying to clear it, but all I got was a high-pitched whine. “Come on, work,” I muttered, smacking the radio. Nothing. I was alone, cut off from whatever warning was out there.The road dipped and curved, and my headlights swept across a sign: “Sharp Curve Ahead. Reduce Speed.” I was doing about 38 miles an hour, cautious for the heavy load. The bulldozer made the trailer feel like it was pulling me backward, especially on turns. As I rounded the bend, my stomach dropped. A line of red brake lights glowed in the distance, maybe a quarter-mile ahead. Cars were stopped dead, snaking around the curve, their taillights like warning beacons. A wreck, just like the CB had hinted.I was too close. Way too close.I eased off the gas and tapped the brakes, gentle to avoid locking the wheels. But the trailer had other ideas. It started to swing, the back end sliding out to the right. “No, no, no,” I whispered, my hands tightening on the wheel. The truck was fighting me, the trailer’s weight pulling it sideways. I could feel the cab tilting, the tires struggling for grip. In the side mirror, I saw the bulldozer’s massive treads looming, the trailer twisting like it wanted to flip.My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it over the engine. I pumped the brakes again, harder this time, but the slide didn’t stop. The trailer was jackknifing, and I was heading straight for the line of cars. I could see them clearly now—a blue sedan, a white pickup, a minivan with a bike rack. People inside, probably families, unaware of the 80-ton beast sliding toward them.I laid on the horn, a long, desperate blast that echoed through the night. “Move!” I yelled, though no one could hear me. My mind was racing, painting pictures I didn’t want to see—metal crumpling, glass shattering, screams. I thought of my daughter, Lily, her gap-toothed grin when I’d come home with a little toy from a gas station. I hadn’t called her in a week, too caught up in the grind of long hauls. I thought of my wife, waiting up for me, probably worried. Regret hit me like a punch. If this was the end, I’d never get to tell them I loved them again.The cars were 100 yards away now, then 50. I yanked the wheel left, trying to keep the trailer in line, but it was like wrestling a bull. The tires screeched, and the cab shuddered as the trailer swung wider. “Come on, stop!” I shouted, my voice breaking. I was out of tricks, out of time. All I could do was pray the brakes would catch.Then, somehow, they did. The tires found a patch of road with just enough grip. The trailer started to straighten, the cab settling back. I eased the brakes, coaxing the rig to a stop. When it finally halted, I was three feet from the blue sedan’s bumper. The woman in the driver’s seat turned, her face pale, eyes wide with terror. She clutched the steering wheel like it was keeping her alive.I sat there, hands shaking, sweat soaking my shirt. My breath came in short gasps, like I’d run a mile. The CB crackled again, and a voice broke through. “Hey, driver, you okay? That was one hell of a slide.”I grabbed the mic, my voice barely steady. “Yeah… I’m here. Barely.”Another truck pulled up beside me, its air brakes hissing. The driver, a guy with a gray beard and a flannel jacket, climbed down and walked over. He looked at my rig, then at the cars, and shook his head. “Man, you’re lucky,” he said, his voice low. “I was right behind you. Thought you were gonna take out half that line.”“Felt like it,” I said, my hands still trembling as I climbed out of the cab. My legs felt like jelly, but I needed air. “What happened up there?”“Car spun out, hit a guardrail,” he said, pointing toward the curve. “Blocked both lanes. Tow truck’s on its way, but it’s a mess. You’re the third rig to come sliding down tonight. First two weren’t so lucky.”A man from the white pickup walked over, his face flushed. “You scared the life out of us,” he said, his voice shaking. “I saw your lights coming and thought we were done for. My kids are in that truck.” He pointed to the pickup, where two small faces peered out the back window.“I’m sorry,” I said, my throat tight. “Didn’t see the traffic till it was too late.”He nodded, running a hand through his hair. “This curve’s a death trap. They need to fix it. Had a bad wreck here last winter—semi took out a family’s car. Never seen anything like it.”A woman from the sedan joined us, her red coat bright in my headlights. “You okay?” she asked, her voice soft but shaky. “I thought you were gonna hit me.”“I thought so too,” I admitted. “Glad we’re all still here.”She gave a weak smile. “This road’s cursed. Happens every year.”We stood there for a moment, strangers bound by a shared brush with disaster. The tow truck’s lights flashed in the distance, and traffic started to creep forward. I climbed back into my cab, my hands still unsteady. The other driver gave me a nod. “Drive safe, man,” he said. “And get that CB fixed.”“Will do,” I said, forcing a smile.The rest of the drive was a blur. I kept my speed low, my eyes glued to the road, every shadow making me flinch. At the next truck stop, I pulled over and sat in the cab for a long time, just breathing. I pulled out my phone and called Lily. It was late, but I didn’t care.“Dad?” she answered, her voice sleepy but happy. “You okay?”“Yeah, kiddo,” I said, my voice catching. “Just wanted to hear you. Tell you I love you.”“Love you too,” she said, confused but sweet. “You coming home soon?”“Soon as I can,” I promised.That night changed everything. I got the CB fixed the next day, paid extra for a top-notch antenna. I started checking road conditions religiously, calling dispatch if anything seemed off. I studied maps for every route, memorizing curves and intersections like my life depended on it—because it did.I still drive that highway sometimes, and every time I approach Dead Man’s Curve, my hands tighten on the wheel. I see those brake lights in my mind, feel the trailer sliding, hear the horn’s wail. The fear creeps in, cold and sharp, reminding me how close I came to losing it all. Some nights, when the road is quiet and the stars are out, I can still feel that moment—the weight of the bulldozer, the pull of the trailer, the certainty that I wouldn’t make it. And I know I’ll never take another curve for granted again.

  


# ""The Crater on 278"":

I’ve been a firefighter with the Camden Fire Department for eight years, long enough to know that some calls stick with you, no matter how much you try to shake them off. Most days, it’s house fires or fender benders, but the call that came in just before dawn on March 27, 2019, was different. My radio buzzed as I sat in the station’s break room, sipping lukewarm coffee, trying to stay awake after a long shift. The dispatcher’s voice was sharp, urgent. “Truck fire on U.S. 278, five miles outside Camden. It’s carrying ammonium nitrate. Get there now.”My heart sank. Ammonium nitrate. I’d seen training videos about it—explosive, unstable, used in fertilizers but capable of leveling everything if it ignites. One wrong move, and we’d be dealing with a disaster. I grabbed my gear, the heavy jacket and helmet feeling like a second skin, and ran to the engine. Jake, our driver, was already in the cab, firing up the siren. Lisa, our rookie, barely a month on the job, climbed in beside me, her eyes wide but focused. The station was quiet except for the clatter of our boots and the wail of the siren as we peeled out onto the empty highway.The road stretched dark and silent, lined with pine trees and the occasional farmhouse. My mind raced, picturing the worst: a fireball, a blast wave, homes caught in the chaos. “Ammonium nitrate,” I said, half to myself. “If that thing blows, it’s like a bomb.”Jake glanced over, his hands tight on the wheel. “How bad we talking?”“Bad,” I said. “One spark in the wrong place, and we’re all gone. We need to clear the area fast.”Lisa leaned forward, her voice shaky but steady. “What’s the plan when we get there?”“Contain the fire if we can,” I said. “But if it’s too hot, we evacuate and wait for hazmat. No heroes today.” She nodded, but I could see the nerves in her eyes. I felt them too, a knot in my gut that wouldn’t loosen.We spotted the truck from a quarter mile away, pulled over on the shoulder of U.S. 278. Orange flames danced under the rear axle, small but angry, licking up from the brakes toward the trailer. The rig was a long-hauler, its trailer marked with hazard placards—red diamonds with white numbers screaming danger. The driver was out front, a guy in his fifties, wiry and weathered, with a flannel shirt and a baseball cap. He was spraying a handheld fire extinguisher at the flames, the white foam hissing uselessly against the growing fire. His face was pale, lit by the flickering glow, and his hands trembled as he worked.I jumped out before the engine fully stopped, my boots hitting the pavement hard. “Sir, get away from the truck!” I shouted, running toward him. The air was thick with the smell of burning rubber and a sharp, chemical tang that stung my nose. My pulse pounded in my ears. That fire was too close to the cargo, and every second felt like a countdown.“I can put it out!” the driver yelled back, not even looking at me. His voice was high, panicked. “I’ve got to save my rig!” He sprayed again, but the flames were spreading, creeping up the trailer’s underside, the metal glowing faintly red.“No, you don’t get it!” I said, grabbing his shoulder. “That’s ammonium nitrate in there. If it catches, it’ll blow us all to pieces. Move back now!”He jerked away, his eyes wild, almost feral. “This is my livelihood!” he snapped. “Twenty years driving, I ain’t losing it now!” He turned back to the fire, spraying harder, but the extinguisher was running low, spitting weak bursts.I glanced at the truck, the flames now licking higher, curling around the trailer’s edge. My radio crackled. “Hazmat’s thirty minutes out,” the dispatcher said. “State police are ten minutes away. Evacuate civilians.” Thirty minutes. We didn’t have thirty minutes. The fire was growing too fast.“Jake, Lisa, start knocking on doors,” I ordered, pointing to the cluster of houses nearby, maybe five or six, their windows still dark. “Get everyone out, at least a half-mile radius. Go!” They nodded and sprinted off, Jake pounding on the first door, Lisa shouting, “Fire department! You need to evacuate now!”I turned back to the driver, my voice sharp. “Listen to me. You’re gonna get yourself killed. We’ve got this. Step back, please!” I was close enough to see the sweat on his face, the way his hands shook as he gripped the extinguisher. For a moment, he met my eyes, and I thought he’d listen. His shoulders slumped, and he took a step back.“Okay,” he muttered, dropping the extinguisher. It clattered on the pavement. “Okay, you’re right.” He started walking toward me, away from the truck. I let out a breath, thinking we’d dodged the worst.Then he stopped. His head turned back to the rig, the flames now a bright orange, hissing louder. “No,” he said, almost to himself. “I can’t lose it.” Before I could react, he ran back to the truck, yanking open the driver’s side door and climbing into the cab.“Stop!” I screamed, sprinting after him. “Get out of there!” My voice was drowned out by the roar of the engine as he started it up. I don’t know what he thought he could do—maybe drive the truck away, save the load, save his job. All I knew was he was making a deadly mistake.I backed away, waving my arms, shouting until my throat burned. The flames were climbing higher, the heat rolling off the trailer in waves. My radio buzzed again—Jake’s voice. “We’ve got two families out. Working on the others. What’s the driver doing?”“He’s in the cab!” I yelled back. “Tell everyone to take cover!”Then it came—a low, deep rumble, like the earth itself was growling. The ground shook under my boots, a vibration that crawled up my spine. I turned to run, but I wasn’t fast enough. A blinding flash lit up the night, followed by a deafening boom that felt like it cracked my skull. A wall of heat and force slammed into me, throwing me backward. I hit the pavement hard, my helmet skidding across the road. Pain shot through my ribs, and my ears rang like a bell that wouldn’t stop. Debris rained down—chunks of metal, shards of glass, clumps of dirt. The air was thick with smoke, choking me as I coughed and gasped.I scrambled to my knees, my hands scraping the asphalt, my vision blurry. The truck was gone. In its place was a massive crater, at least fifteen feet deep and twice as wide, like a giant had punched the earth. The highway was torn apart, jagged edges of pavement jutting out. Trees nearby were flattened, their trunks snapped like matchsticks. The air smelled of scorched metal and chemicals, a bitter sting that made my eyes water.“Jake! Lisa!” I shouted, my voice hoarse, barely audible over the ringing in my ears. I staggered to my feet, ignoring the sharp pain in my side. They were okay, thank God, standing near a house with a family they’d pulled out—a mom, dad, and two kids, all staring at the crater, their faces pale with shock. The mom clutched her kids close, her hands trembling.“You guys alright?” I called, stumbling toward them.“Yeah,” Jake said, but his voice was unsteady. He had a cut on his cheek, blood trickling down. “That was… that was like a bomb.”Lisa pointed to the crater, her hands shaking. “The driver… is he…?”I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to. There was no way he made it. The cab was obliterated, just twisted metal scattered in the wreckage. Later, we’d learn his name was Randall, a trucker from out of state, working for a small company called Blann Trucking. He’d called 911 when the brakes caught fire, thought he could put it out himself. He was wrong.The state police arrived minutes later, their lights flashing in the smoky air. They cordoned off the area, setting up barriers around the crater. Hazmat teams showed up after what felt like forever, their suits gleaming as they tested for chemical leaks. The blast had been felt miles away—windows shattered in homes, car alarms went off in Camden. Our fire truck was damaged, its front end crumpled like a tin can, the windshield cracked. Three of us, including me, had minor injuries—cuts, bruises, a ringing in our ears that lingered for days. My ribs ached every time I moved, probably bruised from the fall, but I was too shaken to care.As we packed up, I couldn’t stop staring at that crater. It was like a wound in the ground, jagged and raw, a reminder of how fast everything can go wrong. I kept replaying it in my head—the driver’s face, his stubborn refusal, the way he climbed back into the cab like he could outrun fate. I’d seen bad calls before, car wrecks that left me sick, house fires that took everything from families. But this was different. The sheer power of it, the way it tore through everything—metal, earth, life—it was humbling. Terrifying.Jake walked up beside me, wiping soot from his face. “You okay, man?” he asked, his voice low.I shook my head, still staring at the crater. “He didn’t have to die,” I said. “If he’d just listened…”“Yeah,” Jake said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “But you know how it goes. People make choices. We can’t always stop ‘em.”Lisa joined us, her gear slung over her shoulder. “I’ve never seen anything like that,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “How do you… how do you keep doing this?”I didn’t have an answer. Not a good one. “You just do,” I said finally. “You go home, you sleep, you come back. But this one… this one’s gonna stay with me.”We loaded up and drove back to the station in silence. The image of that crater, the echo of the blast, the driver’s desperate face—they followed me. They still do. Every time I get a call about a truck fire, my heart skips, and I’m back on that highway, watching a man run toward his own end. Being a firefighter means facing danger, but that day, danger stared back, and it didn’t blink.

  


# ""The Fog That Never Lifts"":

I’m behind the wheel of my rig, hauling a load of steel pipes down Interstate 10 toward New Orleans. The fog’s so thick it’s like driving through a cloud, the kind that makes your headlights useless and turns taillights into faint red smudges. My hands are tight on the steering wheel, fingers aching from the grip. I’ve driven this route for years, but today my gut’s telling me something’s wrong. The road feels alive, waiting to catch me off guard.A sudden screech rips through the quiet—metal grinding, a sound like a scream cut short. My heart slams against my ribs. I hit the brakes hard, the truck shuddering as it slows, but it’s not enough. Out of the fog, a sedan looms, stopped dead in the lane. My rig smashes into it with a bone-rattling crunch, the impact throwing me against my seatbelt. The sedan’s rear collapses like paper, and my trailer skids slightly, tires squealing. I sit there, hands shaking, breath coming in short gasps. I’m okay, but my mind’s racing. What the hell just happened?I grab my flashlight and a crowbar from the cab, my boots hitting the pavement as I jump out. The air smells like burnt rubber and gasoline, sharp and sour. The sedan’s crumpled, its taillights flickering like dying stars. I run to the driver’s side, heart pounding, and shine my light through the window. A woman’s slumped over the wheel, her forehead slick with blood, a thin trickle running down her cheek. The dashboard’s caved in, pinning her legs. Smoke curls from the hood, faint but growing. My stomach twists. This is bad.“Hey! Can you hear me?” I yell, banging on the door. No response. I try the handle—locked. I wedge the crowbar into the doorframe and lean into it, muscles straining. The metal groans, then pops open. The smell of gasoline hits me harder now, making my throat tight. I reach in, unbuckle her, and carefully pull her out, her body limp in my arms. She’s breathing, shallow and uneven, but alive. I lay her on the cold pavement, away from the car, and check her pulse. It’s weak but steady. I fumble for my phone, but the screen shows no signal. Out here, in this fog, I’m on my own.Another crash echoes, closer this time, a deep boom followed by glass shattering. Screams cut through the haze—sharp, panicked voices. My chest tightens. This isn’t just one wreck. It’s a chain reaction, piling up in the fog. I want to stay with the woman, but the screams pull me forward. I grab my flashlight and run toward the chaos, my boots splashing in puddles of spilled fuel.The fog makes everything a nightmare. Shapes loom and vanish—twisted cars, a pickup on its side, a delivery van with its front smashed in. My light catches a minivan flipped upside down, its roof crushed against the road. A little girl, maybe eight, is pounding on the window, her face pale and streaked with tears. “Help! My parents are hurt!” she cries, her voice breaking.“I’m coming!” I shout, sliding to my knees beside the van. The window’s cracked but holding. I tap it gently, trying to keep her calm. “What’s your name, kid?”“Lily,” she sobs. “Please, get them out!”“Okay, Lily, I’m gonna open this door. Stay calm.” The driver’s side door is jammed, metal bent inward. I jam the crowbar into the gap and pull with everything I’ve got. My arms burn, but the door creaks open, scraping against the pavement. Lily scrambles out, her pajamas torn, a cut on her arm bleeding. She grabs my hand, squeezing tight.“My mom and dad—they’re stuck!” she says, pointing inside.I climb halfway into the van, the smell of gasoline and blood hitting me like a wave. The mom’s hanging upside down, seatbelt cutting into her shoulder, her arm bent at a sickening angle. The dad’s next to her, his legs pinned under the dashboard, a deep gash on his thigh soaking his jeans. Both are groaning, barely conscious. “Hey, I’m here,” I say. “I’m getting you out.”The mom’s eyes flutter open. “My daughter… is she okay?” Her voice is weak, raspy.“She’s safe,” I say. “Just hold on.” The van’s hissing now, a faint sizzle from the engine. Smoke’s creeping in, stinging my eyes. I cut the mom’s seatbelt with my pocketknife, catching her as she falls. Her broken arm makes her gasp in pain, but I drag her out, laying her next to Lily. The dad’s harder—his legs are trapped tight. I wedge the crowbar under the dashboard and pry, my shoulders screaming. The metal shifts just enough. “This is gonna hurt,” I warn him.“Do it,” he grunts. I pull, and he yells, blood gushing as his leg comes free. I drag him out, my hands slick with his blood. We’re barely clear when a spark flashes inside the van. I grab Lily and her parents, stumbling back as the van explodes, a fireball lighting up the fog. The heat singes my face, and Lily screams, burying her face in my jacket.“You’re okay,” I tell her, my voice shaking. “You’re all okay.” But the crashes keep coming—metal crunching, horns blaring. It’s like the road’s alive, swallowing cars one by one.I leave Lily and her parents with a bystander who’s stopped, a woman in a nurse’s scrubs already tending to them. “Stay with them,” I tell her. She nods, her face grim. I keep moving, flashlight cutting through the haze. A big rig’s jackknifed across three lanes, its trailer twisted like a broken spine. The cab’s door hangs open, and I hear a man shouting. “Help! I’m trapped!”I climb up to the cab, my boots slipping on the step. The driver’s pinned, his right leg crushed under a collapsed panel. His face is pale, sweat dripping into his eyes. “Hey, stay with me,” I say. “Can you move at all?”“My leg’s stuck,” he gasps. “It hurts bad.”“I’m gonna get you out.” I jam the crowbar into the panel, but it’s bent tight. My arms shake as I pry, the metal screaming but barely budging. Another guy, a driver in a flannel shirt, runs up. “I got a jack in my truck,” he says. “Hold on.”He’s back in seconds with a car jack. We work together, wedging it under the panel. “On three,” I say. “One, two, three!” We push, and the panel lifts just enough. The driver screams as we pull him free, his leg mangled, blood pooling on the cab floor. We drag him out, laying him on the road. A car slams into the trailer behind us, the impact shaking the ground. A second later, another explosion rocks the air, flames shooting up. We duck, shielding the driver.“We gotta stop the traffic,” I tell the flannel guy, my voice hoarse. “More cars are coming.”“Yeah,” he says, wiping sweat from his face. “This is a death trap.”We run toward the oncoming lanes, waving our flashlights like lunatics. “Stop! Turn back!” I shout, but the fog eats my words. Headlights keep coming, too fast, drivers blind in the haze. Another crash—then another, each one a punch to the gut. I see a pickup swerve, smashing into a guardrail. A sedan slams into a stopped car, glass flying. It’s chaos, and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.Finally, red and blue lights pierce the fog. Sirens wail, growing louder. Police cars, ambulances, fire trucks roll in, their lights like beacons. Medics swarm the wreckage, shouting orders. I stumble back to my truck, my legs heavy, hands black with grime and blood. I lean against the cab, trying to catch my breath. The fog’s thinning now, and I can see the full scale of it—cars crushed into each other, trucks folded like accordions, some still smoking. It’s a graveyard of metal, stretching for miles.A cop walks over, notepad in hand. “You okay?” he asks.“Yeah,” I lie, my voice flat. “Just… trying to help.”“You did good,” he says, clapping my shoulder. “We’ll take it from here.”I nod, but I’m not sure I believe him. The screams, the explosions, the smell of gasoline—it’s all stuck in my head, like a movie I can’t stop watching. I climb into my truck, hands still shaking, and wait for the road to clear. Hours later, when they let us drive, I hear the news on the radio: over a hundred vehicles, one dead, dozens injured. One of the worst pile-ups in history.I keep driving, but it’s not the same. At night, when I try to sleep, I see the fog, hear the crashes, feel the heat of the flames. I see Lily’s tear-streaked face, the driver’s mangled leg, the woman slumped in her car. I helped who I could, but it doesn’t feel like enough. That day on Interstate 10 changed me, left scars I can’t see but feel every time I close my eyes. It’s the kind of horror you carry, the kind you can’t ignore, no matter how far you drive.",1,1748428938.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

You’re like a foam on my lips, when I sip my coffee,
Just the thought of you is enough to make me giggle
You’re like the stars on the clear night sky,
Something that can’t be possessed and yet so beautiful


I like the warm atmosphere around you,
It makes me want to close my eyes and think of life
I like the cold demeanor you have in you,
It’s like a cold, refreshing drink after a summer hike


Oh, how great it would be, to be protected by yours truly,
How great it would be, to protect and hold you dearly
Oh, how great it would be, to be your beloved partner,
But what a pity, for I can’t be a lover of someone inside the mirror.",1,1748428820.0,PoetryWritingClub,4,1.0,False
1kxdtcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1kxdtcl/decluttered_kitchen_today/,Decluttered kitchen today,"Went through my kitchen cabinets and removed things I don’t remember using since I moved in (around 2 years ago) 

Air fryer 
Toaster 
Food processors 
Lazy Susan’s 
Tea kettle 
Bodum coffee maker 
Anchor baking dish
Some other things that I do not know the name of lol 

There are some other things that I looked at and said “I haven’t used it but now that it’s not surrounded by these things I might” so I left those in there. Lots of things I forgot I had or didn’t know I had (my late partner was in charge of the kitchen), but they were hiding behind larger items. 

Didn’t touch my pots and pans. I suppose that’s next. 🤣

How do I have so much stuff! I literally just decluttered the kitchen on 3/28. Now two months later I have more things to give away! Feels never ending but at the same time I know the ending is having a space I enjoy being in!

1kxdrvg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxdrvg,Help me design my living room,"Hi there, looking for some ideas designing my space.

Mostly the part circled in red. For scale, it is a 65 inch TV, and I don't mind putting something behind the TV stand as well (I found myself pulling the TV a bit closer to the sofa at times, something around 20-30 cm thick behind the TV is fine).

I am also open to ideas to move things around for the part circled in green.

I am thinking to buy a large floor to ceiling mirror for at least one of the rooms for my apartment, do you think it will fit in the living room?

Looking for something japandi style/wood style items. Maybe wooden wall shelf, wooden frame mirror, etc, if you can link some example items, that would be great too!

Thank you!",1,1748428570.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Cass put her head in her hands. All around her, the moans of the damned suffused with the acrid tang of necromantic idiocy filled the air. She flexed her hands, feeling the pull on her wrist as the three rings connected to her bracer complained. Taking a deep, *calming,* breath, Cass fixed her stare on the young Sí. His eyes were a liquid blue. She liked blue. Composed.

‘You absolutely fucked the ball here kids. You carved a hole in our lovely little enclave, lubed it the fuck up, and gave it the business! How does this even happen? How didn’t you know? Aren’t you in charge here boy? Where the fuck is that English twat?”

Declan – Sgoibair O’Carrol, if she were a formal woman – looked like a bloody jellyfish. Ginearálta

Cassandra Taluka had a reputation as harsh, with a temper like a firework. Giving him another once-over, she decided that maybe her composure needed some work still. The man – no wilting wallflower himself- seemed to be crying a little bit.

‘Ginearálta, the En – um, Ritwick Mens – has been called away. To Mona. He -’

Cass snarled audibly, causing Declan to take a step back quickly. Around her feet, a few of the weeds that hadn’t been eradicated alongside half the base began to wave at the Sgoibair threateningly. ‘And this was when?’

‘Um. Two days ago.’

The concrete cracked as two dandelions shot to Cass’s own height. The same day then. Of course. Cass took a long, deep, *calming,* breath. Ritwick, that arrogant prick. Of course he would just swan off. Of course those English fucks wouldn’t think to tell the leader of their main allies on the British Isles their watchdog was taken away.

“So. You had no psychemancer. Yet you still let these stragglers I n. Did you, in fact, have a fucking aneurysm?’ Deep, calming, breaths. ‘Why?’

Declan O’Carrol took his own deep breaths, squeezing his eyes shut before stammering out his answer.

‘She was pregnant Ginearálta. They were...I thought they couldn’t do much harm. I mean, only one could even cast!’

A dandelion leaf tickled the man’s nose as the plant coiled around his mouth.

“Perhaps now isn’t when you grow enough balls to raise your voice to me, boy.’

Declan nodded frantically, those beautiful baby blues wider than ever. Cass curled her fingers, bringing the plant back away from him. What a fucking disaster this was.



Taking a walk around the camp was not an enjoyable experience. Having teleported here from the front in Scotland at the news, Cass had wanted to make sure she saw exactly what damage had been done. Oh boy, could she see it. Two of the buildings – a mess hall and a converted school-turned-infirmary – had been torn open. A couple of the healers were frantically running between victims of the attack, flashes seeming to quiet one scream before another rose on the air. Cass paused a moment, peering into an opened room in the infirmary.

“No please no I’m fine honestly I barely NO PLE -” A gurgle. An apology. A wet thud. Necromancy was a filthy business. Cass disliked many things. She hated a few. But what did she fear? Not much at all. Some spiders. Always necromancy. Channelling a little of it here and there, very sparingly, could make people a bit odd but nothing much more strange than most of her Aos Sí. However, one thread too many in a spell, one slip with drawing too much into your body, and it seared the mind clean of humanity, personality, all of it. All it left was a raging inferno of a Weaver, completely unable to be reasoned with and only interested in destruction and infection. When the critical channel point of Necromancy is reached, the resulting monstrosity – the lich – forces necromantic energy into other Weavers, trying to force the change that took them. There was only one thing to be done at that point. Even if they’re cogent, even if they begged.



As such, it had quickly become standard practice to have a psychemancer at every base to check any newcomers. Necromancy always left a trace on the brain, and while those imperious Aurorian bastards were okay with using it in a very limited way, Cass had no desire to risk it at all. Any necromancy? No entry, no asylum. That she had to rely on De Aurorae Mens for those psychemancers galled her, but it couldn’t be helped. Her own people hadn’t had the time for such ways of channelling; the fight had been going for much longer in Ireland. The Aos Sí – Cass had always loved mythology – were now exiled to these small islands in the Irish Sea, as well as a couple of bases in the Aurorian lands in Wales. People trickled in from the Irish mainland continually, using the old underground routes she had helped set up almost a decade before to get to safety. The Church of Ireland were ruthless in finding ‘heretics’; only those blessed by the Church and God were permitted to Weave. Anyone else was a witch, and ‘thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’. Therefore, the Aos Sí diaspora had become a haven – including for those she would persecute as well.



Cass turned on her heel suddenly, fixing the still shaking Sgoibair with a level stare. ‘What did you do with her?’

Declan stopped so suddenly Cass wondered if he was going to fall on her. ‘We had to kill the Lich. Ginearálta. Couldn’t do it fast enough, really.’ Cass kept her stare level with effort – if he’d have killed her sooner, her base wouldn’t be belching smoke into the sky. ‘We um..we have her friend. The pregnant one? She’s being held in the intake facility on the beach. She can’t cast.’

Cass turned again, storming towards the beach with Sgoibair O’Carrol tripping over his own feet to catch up. The man was a veteran, had fought on the beaches at Cork against the Inquisitors buying time for refugees to flee. She knew he was no coward – she also knew their were few things as disquieting than Liches. ‘How do you know?’

‘Know, Ginearálta?’

‘That she can’t cast. No psychemancer. Have you got any Resonates here?’ Resonates had been her secret weapon, during those years fighting the Church. The Inquisitors were as fond of spycraft as the Aurorians, employing a vast network of secret police and informants across the country to root out any grassroots magic organisations. However, their mandate from God to use magic had its flip-side – the Church wouldn’t dream of employing non-Weavers, of giving them any say, truth be told. The Resonates had become her way of finding these snakes in the grass – Weavers who’s full speciality was magical identification, obfuscation and eradication. She had heard them called the Witchfinders.

‘We had one, but…’ Declan looked over towards the destroyed buildings. ‘I think you heard their last words, Ginearálta.’

Cass felt sick.



The smell of cheap coffee and cigarettes hit Cass straight in the mouth as she walked into the dank little two-story just off the beach. The sound of the gentle waves fought with her own roiling stomach; truly, she thought the seagulls shrieking fit her mood better. A few people milled around the interior, chugging coffee with a fixed desperation. Glancing at one particularly striking Middle-Eastern man, she caught the glint of red irises glowing behind those mirrored sunglasses. Really, the glasses themselves gave him away more; it was perpetually overcast on Ellan Vannin, or the Isle of Man as the English called it. The world wasn’t easy for Djinn either. Declan smiled at the refugees as they walked past, exchanging a comforting word here and a joke there. Cass had to admit, the Sgoibair could make most people feel at ease. Didn’t hurt that he was so damn pretty either; even her ex-wife had thought so, and her name may as well have been Miss Andry. The smile fell off his face like an overripe apple as they made their way upstairs.

“Ginearálta, she was terrified when they got here. I mean, they all are. She looked like she hadn’t slept for a month, couldn’t sit still.’

‘How did they get here?’

‘Dannel. His squad found them in the ruins of a small village near Londonderry. Apparently someone there had been casting – small stuff, y’know, make his blackberries ripen in the spring. Piddly shit. One of the Inquisitors found out, then found out someone had lied for him. They levelled the place. Burnt Mr Blackberries in the village hall as an example.’ Cass closed her eyes, offering her thoughts to the fallen. It was too easy to forget what was still happening in Ireland sometimes. The routes out may still be functioning, but that only helped *before* the Church brought the holy light of God down on your heads.

‘Where is Dannel now?’

‘Only opened the portal long enough for these few survivors. I never actually saw him Ginearálta. I mean, bloody lucky that he was nearby – well, I mean..’

Cass shook her head, staring at the door in front of her. ‘Lucky for them. Not so much for us.’ Church massacre. Grounded survivor. Luck.

Cass strode through the door, banging it hard against the frame.



The little bedroom was no less dank for being up higher. Moth-eaten curtains fluttered in the breeze, causing patches of light to dance around the room like fireflies. A small cot-bed sat in the corner, and upon an armchair that was more uprooted than upholstery sat the lady in question. Big, dark-brown eyes flickered between Cass and Declan, peeking out from behind a curtain of auburn hair. She was older than Cass had thought, somewhere in her early thirties maybe. Her belly wasn’t enormous, but the pregnancy was visible. Tear tracks ran down her face like they’d always been there. Cass guessed she knew what had happened.

‘My name is Ginearálta Cassandra Taluka. I assume you’ve heard of me?’ The woman nodded, alarm fighting the grief on her face. ‘I’d welcome you to Ellan Vannin, but it would be a lie now, wouldn’t it? Did you know what your friend was?’

The woman’s big fucking moon eyes were already aggravating Cass. She could hear the woman’s breath trembling as she came up with an answer. ‘W-what she was? She..um..she was a Taurus?’ Energy surged in Cass, all blood and life, rot and sun. She drew from the world, as always part of her marvelling at the perfection of it, the balance. Thrusting a hand forward and up, she directed the energy at the two sad looking aloe vera by the woman. Suddenly vibrantly alive leaves whipped around the woman’s arms, pulling them sharply behind her. The lady shrieked, frantically trying to free herself from the relentless yet cooling grip.

‘Believe me, now is not the time to fuck with me. Did you know?’

‘No no please no I didn’t know I still don’t know please!’

Declan stared at Cass with a plea in his eyes. ‘Ginearálta, she’s pregnant, I think she’s just unlucky -’ Cass’s glare snapped to the Sgoibair, fixing his mouth in place. To his credit, he held her gaze – the man had always had some white knight shit going on. ‘Luck? It’s a lot about luck today, isn’t it?’



‘Some people are wrapped in luck. Tied up by it. Don’t you think so, Ginearálta?’ The woman’s voice was not so shaky now. Not so frantic. ‘You made your own luck though, right? All that time against the Church? Until you didn’t.’ Cass made a fist, channelling more energy into the leaves holding the woman, directing another to snap around her neck. The woman smiled, miming not being able to breathe almost jokingly.

‘What are you?’

The woman blinked slowly, her mouth curling even further into a beam, a grimace, a snarl. To Cass, it was like she was trying on faces like masks. ‘C’mon, I might as well have a sign by this point. Do you think I was trying to hide from *you*?’ The woman’s body flickered, rippling like the ocean out the window. At once, she aged 50 years, looking haggard. Missing teeth. Track macks. Then she rippled back to the vulnerable pregnant woman, tears streaming down her beaming face.

Cass felt the breeze in the room rise. She glanced to her side. Declan’s blue eyes glowed as he manipulated the wind. A howling gale constricted the house like a snake, making the beams creak and the windows rattle. ‘Mammonite!’



The Mammonite rolled her wrists, freeing them from the leaves like they wanted her to do it. A brief ripple in the air around them gave Cass the absolute proof; Chance magic was the realm of Mammon, and from what she’d heard, he was a right jealous bastard. ‘Someone here owes a debt Ginearálta. My Lady wants it paid.’

Cass fought to keep her face stoic. Energy surged through her, begging to be released, to let nature take its course quickly through her. Demon-sworn. Evil. Filthy. ‘What’s stopping us from ripping you apart, you nasty fuck? Luck doesn’t get you far against a war machine.’

The creature smiled, rubbing the trembling leaf around her neck like a prized necklace. ‘That necromantic surge was very bloody bright. Almost outshone the sun, to me! My Lady definitely saw – she knows I’m here. You want the Tossed Coin working against you, freedom fighter?’



Cass growled, deep in her throat. With supreme effort, she relaxed her hand, letting the energy seep out of the leaf. Withered in seconds, it fell from around the Mammonite’s throat like confetti. As much as she hated to admit it – even to herself – having the largest magical syndicate in Europe against her would be suicide. The only thing stopping the Church of Ireland from sweeping her ragtag people off the Irish Sea was the threat of direct Aurorian intervention, and half of those English bastards were firmly in the Tossed Coin’s pocket. Closing her eyes in momentary defeat, she waved a hand to Declan. ‘Stand down, Sgoibair.’ The woman rose gracefully, her belly rippling from pregnant to bloated and back.

‘Your pretty Sgoibair here was *so* happy to help. You know, I think he might have had a thing for me! Maybe he’d have gotten his wish.’ She winked almost cartoonishly at Declan. The man looked ghost white, like he might vomit. Cass could sympathise – there were few things as repulsive as demon-sworn to people like them. Not of this world, nature itself rejected them, and those attuned to it like the Aos Sí felt that in their bone marrow.



As the wind died down in tandem with the glow of Declan’s eyes, the sound of the waves filled the room for a moment. The woman stretched, cat-like. Her face rippled, revealing something unhuman, warped with sharp teeth and slit pupils. ‘The debt will be paid. Find the one known as Charlie Bachmann. You have two weeks.’ The woman – the demon-sworn – winked again. ‘I am Merrow, by the way. Welcome to Ellan Vannin.’ Merrow’s form turned inwards, seemingly falling in on herself with a giggle. The smell of cigarettes and cheap perfume, strip bars and sunken faces saturated the room. Cass turned to Declan, warring with her fury and her fear.

Hey everyone!
I’m a 23-year-old guy who recently returned to Kerala after spending the last few years studying outside the state. Most of my close friends are still scattered around the country, and I’m hoping to meet some new people here and build a social circle locally.

I’m based in Malappuram and liked to relocate , but open to connecting with folks from anywhere in Kerala. I enjoy dressing as a boy and as a girls too but didn’t explore it thats y i need a to relocate from my hometown 

It’d be great to find people to hang out with, explore the city, grab a coffee, or even just chat online to start with. I speak Malayalam (not fluently, but getting better 😅), and I’m open-minded and chill.

If you’re also looking to make friends or just want to chat, feel free to drop a comment or DM me. Would love to connect!
