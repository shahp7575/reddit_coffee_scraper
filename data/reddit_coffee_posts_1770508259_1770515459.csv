1qyvvad,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyvvad,Random Acts of Gardening: Biochar Seed Bomb (v2),"I’ve been testing a distance optimized seed bomb meant for tossing into hard to reach spots while giving seeds a better survival chance than standard clay balls. This is my second more compact version.

Short demo & throw test here:

https://youtu.be/thX5Hef9Lc8

Quick build per seed bomb:

Core (coffee filter wrap):

• \~15 seeds

• 10g inoculated biochar

• 3g local silt

• 1g clay

• tied with jute twine

Weight core:

• 5g small pebbles for range & stability

Outer shell:

• 5g inoculated biochar

• 22g sand

• 45g local clay

• add water until doughy, then flatten

Dry 4–7 days

Optional finish:

• Light brush of wood vinegar once dry for mild pest deterrent

Why this works better than basic seed balls:

• Biochar holds moisture & nutrients

• Coffee filter keeps seeds together & wicks water

• Clay shell protects on impact

• Weighted design throws farther and breaks open slower

Note on white fuzz while drying:

That’s usually beneficial microbes, not rot. Totally fine.

1qyvt1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutcomeDementia/comments/1qyvt1d/sonicexe_dangered_souls/,Sonic.exe Dangered Souls,"I just had a shower thought about a Sonic asym game concept that had like survivors and people that are in danger and thought that I would post a concept around that.

Here's where my inspiration comes from

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicEXEOutcomeMemory/comments/1qtsa2l/comment/o38sw72/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicEXEOutcomeMemory/comments/1qtsa2l/comment/o38sw72/?context=3)

So here's how it works

There's gonna be 3 killers at launch

Kolossos - Possessed Modern Sonic

Superstars Sonic.exe - Possessed Classic Sonic

curse\_DOLL - Possessed Tails Doll

curse\_DOLL concept and moveset

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutcomeMemories/comments/1qua6sf/replacement\_tails\_doll\_exe\_concept/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutcomeMemories/comments/1qua6sf/replacement_tails_doll_exe_concept/)

Kolossos is gonna be a beeg slow hitter.

Sstars Sonic.exe is gonna be a small fast hitter

curse is gonna be a trapper

Kolossos moveset

Attack

Kolossos will swipe his claw hand, doing 20 damage/10 dodge meter to a survivor, staggering them when doing so, and then slash with his spike arm, doing 30 damage/15 dodge meter to a survivor.

Rush

Kolossos will charge forward with his spike arm reached out. He can turn when he's charging, although it'll be like trying to drift with a car that has 0 points in handling while on ice in a racing game. It'll do 30 damage/15 dodge meter to the first survivor that gets caught and do 15 damage/7.5 dodge meter to any other survivors that gets caught as well. The charge will last for 8 seconds or until Kolossos hits a wall.

Dropkick

Kolossos will stab the ground with his spike arm, then launch himself forward to do a dropkick. The ground stab will make a shockwave. If a survivor gets hit directly by the spike arm, it'll do 25 damage/12.5 dodge meter and burry them. If any survivors get hit by the shockwave, it'll do 5 damage/2.5 dodge meter and it'll push the survivors that take the 5 damage and not push the survivors that takes 2.5 dodge meter. The dropkick itself will do 28 damage/14 dodge meter and it'll launch the survivor that takes 28 damage super far and not launch the survivor that dodges. If Kolossos misses the dropkick, he will fall face flat on the ground and he'll take 2 seconds to get back up. You can also aim where you want to dropkick to.

Indicator

Kolossos' pupils will glow a bright red for 6 seconds. During that time, Kolossos can see where everyone is. When he's indicating, all his moves will be locked until the 6 seconds are up.

Superstars Sonic.exe (Sstars Sonic.exe)

This is this game's version of the small Sonic.exe from TD. He takes the form of Classic Sonic from Sonic Superstars because Kolossos already took the form of Modern Sonic. Though this game's Sonic is still alive and himself. The reason why I chose Superstars Sonic was because of the chaos emerald powers could make an interesting moveset for a Sonic.exe. He can't make clones without the blue chaos emerald and he can't disguise himself as anyone.

Passive:

Jumpball

When Sonic.exe jumps, he'll curl up into a ball. It'll do 5 damage/2.5 dodge points and pushes survivors away.

Attack

Sonic.exe will raise his hand, getting a slight speed boost, then lunges forward when he swipes. It'll do 10 damage/5 dodge meter and will cause a bleed status for 5 seconds. When a survivor is bleeding, they'll be slowed down, take 1 damage per second they have it, and cannot be attacked until the bleeding ends.

Dropdash

Sonic.exe will jump in the air, then perform a dropdash. The initial jump will do the same thing as his passive. The dropdash will act exactly like Sonic's dropdash from OM except that for the 3rd and final hit, Sonic.exe will stop spinning and will jump up and do an axe kick on the survivor that he hit. The first two hits will do 5 damage/2.5 dodge meter and the final hit will do 10 damage/5 dodge meter and ragdoll the survivor.

Emerald Power

Sonic.exe will pull out a Chaos Emerald and he'll raise it high up. Depending on what Chaos Emerald he has equipped will result in a different move.

Red: Sonic.exe will turn into a fireball that will inflict burn damage on survivors

Blue: Sonic.exe will generate 3 clones that will make survivors hallucinate. They can be killed by a ranged attack.

Green: Sonic.exe will whip out a vine that can latch onto survivors and pull them towards him fast. He can be stunned out of this by another survivor.

Yellow: Sonic.exe will slow down survivors that are in the highlighted circle around him when he has the yellow chaos emerald equipped.

Purple: Sonic.exe's pupils will glow a bright purple as he will be able to see where everyone is. He'll gain a minor speed boost and will still be able to use his moves when indicating.

Cyan: Sonic.exe will transform into a blob of water that creates a trail of water that slows down the survivors and make them slippery.

White: Sonic.exe will jump in the air and a random button will appear on your screen. If you press the correct button, Sonic.exe will homing attack on the closest survivor. You can homing attack a survivor 3 times with a quick time event after you land each attack. It'll do 10 damage each/5 dodge meter.

Survivors can stop him from using the ability by stunning him when he's pulling out and raising the Chaos Emerald.

Swap

Sonic.exe will switch which emerald he'll use when he uses the Emerald Power ability. He'll swap between Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, Cyan, and Purple.

The Survivors goals is to save the character they're assigned to and escape with them.

The survivors and who they're supposed to save are:

Tails - Save Sonic

Honey - Save Amy

Vanilla and Chocola - Save Cream

Ray - Save Mighty

Eggman - Save Metal Sonic

Blaze - Save Silver

Rouge - Save Shadow

Kit - Save Surge

Whisper - Save Tangle

Nicole - Save Sally

There's a few unique things about this game

1. If you die while having the character you're supposed to save, instead of spectating, you'll swap to that character who only has 10 HP and a dodge meter of 100.
2. There's no minions in this game. If you die, you die.
3. There's gonna be 2 maps that are gonna be played at the same time. Half of the server is gonna be in 1 map while the other is gonna be in the other map. There's gonna be a ring in the 2 maps that lets you go to the other map that's being played.

I'ma explain how the saving mechanic works. There's gonna be clues around the map that you spawn in that will give you hints on where the item related to the character you're supposed to save is. Once you get the item, You can use it to help you save the character you're supposed to save in the other map. There's also gonna be clues in the other map that'll give hints on where the character is.

Vanilla and Chocola

""Cream dear! Don't worry, I'm coming! I won't let you die!""

Item needed: Cheese

Once found

""There you are Cheese! Don't worry, Chocola is here with me. Now, where is Cream?""

Moves:

Chao Pirouette

Vanilla will spin with one leg while the other is stretched out, making it a multi-hit stun. Chocola will spin around Vanilla, acting like a shield that blocks attacks and reflects ranged attacks once. Vanilla will get a speed boost from spinning and will be spinning for 5 seconds before stopping or until Chocola blocks an attack. If Vanilla ate chocolate, then Chocola can block 2 attacks. If she has Cheese, then Cheese and Chocola will spin around Vanilla, blocking/reflecting 2 attacks. If Vanilla ate chocolate, then Chocola and Cheese can block 4 attacks.

Snack time!

Vanilla will bring out a random food or drink and depending on what it is will make it heal a different amount of HP and maybe give a little bonus.

Cookie

Vanilla will bring out a cookie and will eat it, healing 35 HP. This can also heal nearby survivors

Coffee

Vanilla will bring out a glass of coffee and will drink it, healing 15 HP and doubling her speed for 3 seconds. This can also do the same effects to nearby survivors

Chocolate

Vanilla will bring out a bar of chocolate, split it between herself and Chocola, healing 18 HP while making her next chao move stronger. If she has Cheese, then she will also split it with him, healing 12 HP and making her next chao move stronger. This can heal nearby survivors.

Intimidate

Vanilla will give an intimidating glare to the exe, slowing them down and locking their moves for 5 seconds.

Chao Attack

Vanilla will signal chocola to attack the exe, stunning him for 3 seconds and push them back. If Vanilla ate chocolate, then Chocola will do a chao tornado, attacking the exe multiple times before launching them away in an arc. If Vanilla has Cheese, then Cheese can attack the exe as well, stunning him for an additional second. If Vanilla ate Chocolate, then Chocola will do a chao tornado as Cheese places an Omachao bomb at where the exe is gonna land at.

Once Cream is saved, Cheese will return to Cream, leaving Vanilla with only Chocola again. Also, Cream can make Vanilla's healing better. Cream can also help Vanilla by gliding with her.

Cream: \*Cough\* \*Cough\* t-thank you mother.

Vanilla: I'm just glad that you're alive Cream. Once we escape, I'll help your wounds.

Vanilla will need Cheese to save Cream because there's gonna be a blocked path that requires you to use Chao Attack to hit two buttons at the same time.

Tails

""Don't worry Sonic! I'm on my way!""

Item needed: Flame Ring

Once found

""The flame ring! What is it doing here? Nevermind that, I must find Sonic!""

Flight

Tails will fly with his tails. He can fly for 8 seconds if he only flies up. He can carry one person, but that makes him only be able to fly up for 5 seconds.

Arm Cannon

Tails will have 2 modes for his arm cannon.

Energy Ball, and Magic Glove Trap (MGT)

Energy Ball will have Tails blast a ball of electricity out of his Arm Cannon that when makes contact with the exe, will push them and stun them for 3 seconds. It can also explode if it hits anything with collision and the explosion will just push the exe

MGT will have Tails shoot out an orb like whatever this is called (I'm dogshit at explaining stuff)

[Tails will be able to put this on the ground or in the air](https://preview.redd.it/6xd8maj2jkhg1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=45170330f02a0aec9471eb77f28bd18a198fa452)

and when the exe makes contact with it, they will be punched the opposite way of where the exe ran to it from and be stunned for 2 seconds. If the exe makes contact with it in the air, they will be punched down and stunned for 2 seconds. If Tails shoots an orb while in the air, he'll aim downwards and launch it down, giving him a slight boost up in the air and punching the exe up if the exe makes contact with it. Tails can shoot out 5 of these max. The best way to use this is to place one that will punch the exe to the next one that will then punch them to the next one and so on. This won't stun stack, it'll instead, stun replace which means that it'll replace the stun time that the exe has to 2.

Magic Glove

Tails will bring out his own magic glove. Tails will punch with his magic glove all around him and if it makes contact with the exe, the exe will be launched extremely far away and be stunned for 2 seconds.

Chu² Bomb

Tails will summon his Chu² bomb. It's a cute tiny little bomb that will follow the exe for 10 seconds before disappearing. When it makes contact with the exe, it will explode and stun the exe for a second.

Tail Spin Attack (TSA)

Tails will start spinning with his Tails out. It's a multi hit stun that makes Tails move faster. Each hit will stun the exe for 2 seconds.

Tails will need to get the flame ring because there's a metal box blocking a spring that's required for you to reach Sonic.

Once Sonic is saved, Tails will give Sonic his flame ring back and if you press the m1 button, Sonic will do a fire somersault forward where Tails is facing. If the exe gets hit, they will be stunned for 1.5 seconds and will be slowed down from the burn status. This of course has a cooldown to prevent you from spamming it.

Sonic: T-thanks little buddy \*Cough\* \*Cough\*

Tails: I should've brought my healing machine!

Sonic: Don't push yourself t-too h-hard little buddy

Tails: You're right, We must focus on escaping

Honey

""I'll make whoever decided to try to get rid of my best friend and customer pay. But first, I should focus on finding Amy""

Item required: Amy's Piko Piko Hammer

Once found

""Amy's hammer! I bet Amy is so worried about her hammer hehe-focus Honey, focus.""

Glide

Press Jump when in the air to glide with your wings you can cancel the glide by pressing the jump button. You can hit the exe with your glide to push you and him away from eachother while giving yourself a speed boost.

Attack

Honey will punch the exe and you can press the attack button 3 more times, making her do 2 more punches and ending off with a kick that launches the exe up.

Shadow Sneak

Honey will spin so fast in a circle that she creates afterimages of herself. If you press the attack button during Shadow Sneak, Honey will dash through the circle super fast. It'll look like this but in a small circle and black and red if you mash the punch button.

https://i.redd.it/3n41nzhi1rhg1.gif

Stomp

Honey will jump really high and then stomp on the ground, giving the exe the flattened status if they get hit that slows them down and makes their moves alot weaker, but it will also make it harder to stun the exe due to them being as flat as a pancake. This move can hit an already stunned exe.

When Honey saves Amy, she will give Amy back her Piko Piko Hammer and Amy can bounce Honey up higher with her Hammer.

Honey: There you are Amy!

Amy: O-oh \*Cough\* \*Cough\* Hey Honey!

Amy: Why did you come here? Was it for HC?

Honey: W-well, maybe? And also because you're one of my best friends. Nevermind, let's focus on escaping to get you in... cleaner clothes.

Honey will need the Piko Piko Hammer because there's a button in the air that requires Honey to do a hammer bounce and then a hammer flip on the button to open a door that leads to the room where Amy is.

Ray

""I'm always the one who needs to be saved, but, am I really fit to be the savior? N-no t-time for self doubt, Mighty is in trouble and it's my turn to save him!""

Item needed: Bound Ring

""Two rings attached to eachother by some weird yellow energy? No time to be questioning that, Mighty still needs to be saved!""

Soar (Only usable in the air)

Ray will soar through the skies and you can hold the jump button to descend and gain speed and release the jump button to ascend and convert that speed to vertical height. You can soar to a wall to cling onto it then jump off it to get more height. Ray will be able to pick up one person to carry while soaring.

Tail Attack

Ray will spin with his tail out, attacking any exe in the way, stunning them for a second and pushing them back. Ray will gain speed if he uses it while running at full speed.

Tail Slam Bounce (Only usable in the air)

Ray will perform a flip then slam the ground with his Tail, causing a shockwave and a crack on the floor, then bounce up and away. If the exe is caught in the shockwave, they'll be pushed back and be ragdolled. If the exe gets caught directly by the tail slam, then there won't be a shockwave and Ray will instead, slam on the exe and bounce off them. This will stun the exe for 3 seconds and ragdoll them.

Wind Boost (Only usable while soaring)

Ray will flap his wings, getting a wind boost to help him get momentum for soaring.

When Ray saves Mighty, Ray will give Mighty one ring while he keeps the other and Mighty can help launch Ray high to the sky by throwing his ring up and Ray will hold onto his ring, slowly descending after he reaches the max height the ring can go. Ray can let go of the ring and start soaring.

Mighty: R-Ray?! What're you doing here?! You could've been killed!

Ray: Yet here I am. I really thought you'd be more proud and grateful that I'm here to save you.

Mighty: Sorry Ray, I'm just scared of losing you.

Ray: I'm also scared of losing you too. Now come along and we'll try to escape!

Ray will need the bound ring because there's gonna be a breakable wall that Ray needs to sling himself to to break.",2,1770514771.0,OutcomeDementia,0,1.0,False
1qyvt18,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qyvt18/the_psychology_of_overhelping_its_not_kindness/,"The Psychology of Over-Helping: It's Not Kindness, It's Fear","I used to think I was just a really good friend. Always available, always saying yes, always swooping in to solve everyone's problems. Then I realized I wasn't being kind; I was being terrified. Terrified of rejection. Terrified of conflict. Terrified that if I stopped being useful, people would stop wanting me around.

This pattern is everywhere. We see it in our friends, our relationships, and our workplaces. Society rewards ""selflessness"" while quietly punishing boundary-setting. And here's the kicker: biology doesn't help. Our brains are wired for social acceptance because historically, being cast out from the tribe meant death. So we've evolved to be hypervigilant about staying in everyone's good graces.

But chronic over-helping isn't noble. It's exhausting. It breeds resentment. And weirdly, it actually damages relationships because you're not showing up as your authentic self; you're performing.

After diving deep into research, podcasts, books, and way too many therapy sessions, here's what actually helps:

**\*\*Recognize the difference between helping and rescuing\*\***

Real help empowers someone. Rescuing creates dependency. When you jump in before someone asks, you're actually communicating, ""I don't think you're capable."" Dr. Harriet Lerner talks about this brilliantly in her work on relationship dynamics. She points out that chronic rescuers often grew up in environments where they had to manage other people's emotions to feel safe.

The fix: pause before offering help. Ask yourself if they've actually requested it. If not, maybe they don't need you to fix it. Maybe they just need you to listen.

**\*\*Understand your ""why.""\*\***

Most over-helpers have a sneaky motive hiding underneath. Mine was ""if I'm indispensable, you can't leave me."" Brutal to admit, but true. Psychologist Dr. Nicole LePera (check out her work on Instagram and her book ""How to Do the Work"") explains this as a trauma response. When you grow up in unstable environments, you learn that your value comes from what you can do for others, not from simply existing.

The fix: next time you feel compelled to help, pause. Ask yourself what you're afraid will happen if you don't. Write it down. You'll probably notice patterns.

**\*\*Stop apologizing for boundaries\*\***

Boundaries aren't mean. They're necessary. But we've been socialized to believe that saying no makes us selfish. Dr. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability and shame shows that people with strong boundaries are actually better at connection because they're not operating from resentment.

Start small. ""I can't take on extra work this week"" doesn't need a dissertation explaining why. ""No"" is a complete sentence, even if it feels terrifying at first.

**\*\*Use the ""oxygen mask"" principle\*\***

Flight attendants tell you to secure your own oxygen mask first for a reason. You can't help anyone if you're passed out. This isn't selfish; it's practical. The app Finch is weirdly helpful for building this habit. It gamifies self-care through a virtual pet that grows when you complete daily check-ins and self-care tasks. Sounds ridiculous, works beautifully.

**\*\*Practice disappointing people\*\***

This sounds masochistic, but hear me out. You need exposure therapy for your fear of letting people down. Start with low-stakes situations. Decline a coffee invite. Don't respond to a text immediately. Don't volunteer for the office bake sale.

What you'll discover: most people don't care nearly as much as you feared. And the ones who get genuinely upset that you set a boundary? Those are the people who benefited from you having none.

**\*\*Read ""codependent no more"" by Melody Beattie. tie\*\***

This book is a classic for a reason. Beattie, who's spent decades researching codependency and relationship patterns, breaks down how over-helping becomes an addiction. You get hooked on being needed because it temporarily soothes your anxiety about your own worth. The book is packed with practical exercises for identifying codependent patterns and replacing them with healthier behaviors.

If reading full books feels overwhelming or you want to explore more resources on codependency and boundary-setting, BeFreed might be worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. 

You can set specific goals like ""learn to set boundaries without guilt as a chronic people-pleaser,"" and it pulls from psychology books, therapist insights, and relationship research to create a tailored learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus there's this virtual coach called Freedia you can chat with about your specific struggles, which makes the whole process feel less isolating. It's been helpful for replacing mindless scrolling time with actual growth.

**\*\*Reframe ""selfish.""\*\***

We treat selfishness like it's the worst thing you can be. But there's healthy selfishness, the kind that says ""my needs matter too."" Dr. Aziz Gazipura's podcast ""Shrink for the Shy Guy"" (despite the name, it's for everyone) has incredible episodes on assertiveness and self-worth that challenge the idea that prioritizing yourself is inherently wrong.

When you meet your own needs, you show up better for others. You're not running on fumes and resentment. You're actually present.

**\*\*Notice the resentment\*\***

Resentment is your body's check engine light. If you're feeling bitter about how much you do for others, you're over-giving. Period. This isn't about them being ungrateful; it's about you ignoring your limits.

Journal about it. When do you feel most resentful? With whom? What were you hoping would happen that didn't? Usually you'll find you were expecting mind-reading or some kind of transaction: I'll do this, then they'll finally see my worth.

**\*\*Get comfortable with guilt\*\***

Here's the thing nobody tells you: setting boundaries will make you feel guilty at first. Your nervous system is used to people-pleasing as a safety strategy. When you stop, it freaks out and floods you with guilt to try to get you back in line.

Feel it anyway. Guilt is just an emotion, not a directive. The app Insight Timer has guided meditations specifically for sitting with uncomfortable emotions without acting on them. Revolutionary concept, it turns out.

Look, I'm not saying become a selfish asshole who never helps anyone. I'm saying check your motivations. Help from a place of genuine care and abundance, not fear and depletion. The people who truly love you don't need you to sacrifice yourself to earn your place in their lives. You already have it.",1,1770514771.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

AITAH,"Ok, buckle in because this will be a long one and 14 years of never talking negatively about my significant other. 

We share two children, both boys 4yrs and 8 months. Currently me and the 4 year old are down BAD with the flu. I’m talking the sickest I’ve been in many many years. The 4 year old is doing a lot better but unfortunately I am at the beginning stages of the illness and I have a terrible immune system so when someone gets sick in this house, I’m always getting sick. Where as my husband is the opposite. He rarely gets sick, and when he does, it’s a fraction as bad as me and the kids. He admits that he has a great immune system and constantly comments on how bad mine is. In our entire children’s lives, I can’t think of a single time that I’ve been sick enough to not take care of the children and stay in bed all day. 

Today I woke up absolutely miserable. My body is aching. I’m nauseous. Dry cough. Pounding head ache. It’s the weekend so we are both off. Our kids wake up at 7am and I immediately tell him I caught what our son has and feel horrible. He has the kids come into our bedroom and hang out on the bed when I ask if I can stay in bed to sleep in and he reluctantly agrees. I know he was trying to get me to get up with them. So after being in bed with all of them awake for a little bit he finally takes the kids out of the room. I sleep till 9:30. He wake me up to tell me our youngest is tired and I need to feed him. Cool, I breast feed him and he takes him to his crib and he falls asleep. I go downstairs to be with the family. My husband tells me he’s going to go out to the nearby city because I planned to today but I am to sick. He still wants his coffee so he offers to go. I tell him I’ll take a coffee but I’m not hungry and Idk if I’ll drink it. He leaves from 11-2 and goes out to eat, Walmart to grab some things for supper, and get our coffee. Awesome. Out of that 3 hours the kids slept 1.5 hours for me. I felt miserable and I laid in bed while the kids napped while I continued to feel worse. He comes home and about 5 minutes before he comes home the baby wakes up and I nurse him. My husband is irritated the baby is up but takes him downstairs with him. When my 4 year old wakes up I offer for him to spend the day in bed with me since he was still a little sick and to take the load off of my husband. The baby ends up taking another 45 minute nap and I feed him and once again my husband takes him downstairs. I constantly hear the baby crying as the night goes on. I text him asking what’s going on. I can hear him getting angry. Talking in an immature mocking tone. I send him a text to just bring him up. He does. I try feeding the baby. Once he’s done he’s still crying on me. My head is throbbing at this point. I lose my patience and send my husband a text telling him I’m basically pissed that he can’t take care of his son for 4 hours(with a 45 minute nap during) and mad that he had absolutely no empathy on my condition. I also included how I’ve taken the 4 year old most of the day so he didn’t have to take care of both.He tells me the baby is bored and won’t stop crying. I told him to basically stop playing video games for a little bit and to sit on the floor with him like I do most nights during his witching hour. He tells me he’s just going to take the baby and drive an hour away. Great. He comes up and takes the baby from me. Tells me I did not have our 4 year old all day (talking about the time from 7:30-9:30) and that I need to get it together or go to the hospital. So basically I have to either be so sick I need to go to the hospital, or take care of our kids. There’s no in between or world where I can stay in bed a day when I’m sick and he takes care of the kids. I feel like everything just cleared up to me. I started crying. I NEVER cry infront of the kids or cry much at all for that matter. He leaves with both kids and says nothing. As I laid in the dark I got sick and started vomiting. He never came back. He never checked in on me all day or asked if I needed anything. I asked him for medicine and tea once earlier in the day, which he did do. He just made it very known that this was a huge inconvenience to him that I was sick. He understands and acknowledges that he’s acting this way but he does not care. 

If someone else were to disrespect me, he would be furious. But he does not care if he does. 

Idk what to do. I’ve been with him for over half my life. He’s a great dad to our 4 year old. He does get pissy about playing with him, but he will do it. 

His love language is gift giving and receiving. He’s always buying stuff for our 4 year old but rarely does he give words of affirmation or touch. 

He will NEVER iniate kissing me. About 8ish or so years ago he decided that kissing grosses him out and makes a big deal if I try to kid him and wipes his mouth immediately after. When we were younger we kissed every chance we got. I can deal with the no kissing, it does hurt, but I can deal. But my love language is actions and words of affirmation. I don’t get either of those. 

He’s a good person. I know that. At the same time time, he’s super negative and constantly finds the negative in absolutely everything. We are finally going to take the kids to the beach this year and shelling out a lot of money. I’m excited but also I know he’s going to be extremely negative the entire time. 

I’m also worried if we were to ever separate, because let’s be real, after tonight I feel like we are in a loveless marriage, I could not leave my 8 month old with him. He’s exclusive to breastfed and I know he would be overwhelmed with him long term. I do not believe he would ever hurt him physically. I want to make that very clear. 

I put the kids to bed, he asked me if I wanted money for the grocery order. And then he went downstairs without saying another word to me. I’ve never felt more alone. AITAH for not being more understanding of his position? 

If you’ve read this far. Thank you. I’ve never vented about him to anyone. And i want to make it clear I’ve begged him to do solo plus couples counseling for his depression and pessimism. He refuses.

The specific replacement beaker I bought was this one: https://grosche.ca/products/replacement-beaker-2-2?variant=49228126060853

A few review points:

* Great price! I paid $17.99 for the 1L variant (they're currently asking for $19.99 on their own site). Other options I saw were looking for way more than this (I saw price points at $20, $25, and Bodum was asking a ridiculous $33 plus shipping).
* Fits the original Bodum frame perfectly. 
* The beaker feels nice and sturdy. The glass is actually thicker and heavier than the original Bodum one (I weighed it, it is about 20-30g heavier than the Bodum beaker).
* Humorously, the tolerance on the plunger is much tighter / better with the new beaker. I actually had to, you know, plunge, instead of just press down lightly with no resistance.

The company is based out of Cambridge, ON (and I wish I had known earlier, I'm local and would have been buying from them way sooner), and they claim every purchase helps fund clean drinking water in Africa.

Their products appear to be largely made in Asia, but I'm not going to hold that against them when my experience with this one has been high quality, a very reasonable price, and the profit going to a Canadian-owned business.

Is it too much to ask that you remember I had a client product pitch and either wish me luck or ask me how it fucking went?

Is it too much to ask that I be asked if I am up for sex before you start gnawing my my nipple at 9:30pm when my non-stop day started at 2am? Even then, I figured it was better for us to have that physical connection since it happens so infrequently, so I gave you as much as I could and made sure you got yours, only to be told after that you had hoped it would relieve your headache, but it hadn't... Great way to make me feel like a wet hole that leaves you disappointed...

And today... When the dogs wanted outside before 5am, you were fucking awake when you asked me 3 fucking times if I wanted you to let them out or do it myself... You had to ask 3 fucking times because I was fucking sleep mumbling and I know to you, exhausted from fighting a tension headache all damn night. And guess what, I fucking got up to take care of OUR dogs. Like I do every fucking morning without having to ask if I should.

Then, after a morning of pain and emotional turmoil at your lack of fucking respect for me this week, I went out to get your coworker a wedding shower card and stopped to grab you food you like so you could have brunch since I know you didn't make yourself anything after staying in bed until 10am.

When I get home and tell you I have a tension headache, I still make and serve your fucking coffee. I unload and reload the dishwasher as I am tasked to maintain the house and all chores. I finally eat some soup while you showered for your friend's wedding shower. I unload all of my work stuff from my car because you are more physically comfortable in that car. When you get out of the shower, you ask me what the fucking dress code is 🤬 The invite has been on the fridge for no less than 2 months. It doesn't say. How the fuck am I supposed to know? Why didn't you ask YOUR FRIEND?

You make a comment about the dress I picked being fancy when you don't have anything to match and will be going in casual clothes... So, with 30mins to get ready, I change my outfit to something slightly less fancy as I wasn't comfortable going casual. I am trying to get ready as fast as I can and you are talking to me about how I feel and where the dog is... Fuck! I am getting ready and trying to push through this fucking headache for YOUR FRIEND. Let me get ready! 

You ask about stopping to get them a gift on the way. I told you multiple times that we can get them something on their online registry or give them money for their honeymoon through their wedding website. ""I only see theu are registered on Amazon, but no website or anything"". The fucking QR Code is on their wedding invite on the FUCKING FRIDGE!!! Fuck you and your weapon used incompetence. You have the extra money as I only get access to basically an allowance for bills and groceries. You gift your friend whatever you want.

I fucking drove to the party, as I always do. You didn't even care to figure out where it was. I drink water the whole time and don't eat be my headache is making me queazy. After knowing that, you get another fucking beer. I try to chat with friends I don't see often, smiling through the pain. Trying my best to be present. I finally have to fucking tell you that I need to go because I am hurting so badly and the party is wrapping up. I STILL FUCKING DRIVE US HOME! I am squinting from the pain and I fucking drove us home. You didn't think to ask until I was in the driver's seat buckling my seatbelt.

We get home and checking the mail is more important than opening the front door for me. As you come in behind me, you fucking grab my ass. I felt like a 1950's seasoned secretary who doesn't have the energy to challenge inappropriate touch anymore. It was easier to ignore it and just keep moving. I let the dogs out while you went to the bathroom with your upset tummy. I stripped out of my clothes and crawled into bed, hoping the heated mattress pad would help relieve some of my muscle tension.

You get into bed beside me. Not trying to comfort me..not offering to rub my neck or shoulders. Then you fucking fall asleep while I lay there in pain, trying to not disrupt your fucking nap after being out of bed for 5 hours. Once the pups tell me it is time to potty and eat, I start talking to you about dinner. Do you want to hear up something ready to eat but frozen or order in as everything sounds awful as I am queazy. You chose to order in so ""WE"" don't have to worry about cooking or dishes. Fine, pick something and I will choose the least disgusting option to try and eat. Then he proceeds to ask me questions... NOTHING SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. PICK WHATEVER YOU WANT. But you can use decide on your own. So I offer boxed Mac n cheese that is in the pantry. You agree in a way that tells me I am.back on the hook to make dinner. So, I get up.

I let the dogs out to potty. I feed them dinner. I start making dinner when you ask me if I want you to take over in the kitchen. No, I am already here. A few mins later , you ask me again ""are you sure you don't want me to take over?"" For fucks sake! Stop fucking asking..just fucking do something. I would fucking love for you to have the initiative to make yourself boxed Mac n cheese so I don't have to. I would love for you to be a gentleman and drive me home when I am in so much fucking pain. I would love for you to pay attention the basic needs of our dogs so it isn't always on me. But if you have to ask, then I will always do it my fucking self.

I need some ideas for quick grab and go, collagen and vitamin C rich breakfast options. Convenience is key, as I find it hard to make good food choices if it’s not easy. I’ve tried smoothies but they’re too much prep and planning and I hate bananas ungodly texture. Natural yoghurt is off the table because I already have too much diary. 

I need simple, sustainable snack ideas because internet recipes are too complicated and unsustainable for me long-term. I’m fed up with feeling and looking like shit. Making changes is tough with ADHD, so I need solutions I can stick with that work even after the dopamine hit fades.

Any ideas would be very much appreciated! ",2,1770513180.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

No one is trying to really create value, but rather, figure out how to maximize value by using complex psychological tricks, financial witchery, and hot potato. 

Like, it's literally everything... That coffee maker of yours? Some asshole somewhere was like, ""Hmm... I don't want to figure out how to make a better coffee maker so more people buy our stuff. Instead, we got to figure out a way to make more money off the people who have those coffee makers"" and that mother fucker put DRM in Keurig coffee cups in an attempt to just squeeze a little more money out... Instead of, you know, innovating so more people buy his shitty coffee machine. 

Even video games... Why are there so many games that have been around for 10 years? No sequels around here. Just building on top of the existing thing, by throwing in more sophisticated gambling algorithms, psychological hooks, and iunno, a titty every now and then. Open a crate. Get a monthly pass. Weekend special event. NO value is being added anywhere. Just mechanisms exploiting our humanity.

I never thought I'd live through an era when we literally found a way to monetize on dating. Literally, the most basic core human experience, now has a 30 dollar a month membership plan (27 if you pay for 3 months), just to increase your odds when you're ready to take your shot. 

During COVID the beef prices were really high, and you'd think, ""Man must be a good time to be a cattle rancher."" Nope. No it wasn't. The cartel actually got ranchers to pay less, because they figured out a system where they get them reliant on their distribution network, then threaten to cut them off if they don't hand over even more profits. This distribution network didn't make things cheaper, safer, faster, or better. Nope, they just figured out a way to better fuck people over by adding no value and extracting as much as possible. 

Then you look at other developing nations, and it's fucking embarrassing. Richest country on the planet, but we have ghettos, crime, prison society, mental health issues, and not a god damn thing to show for it.. well other than the top creating 10s of millions in wealth while the middle class lost wealth. 

But that wont stop us from voting for one side because they promise to not tax our tips, or the other side who promises to just take out loans we have to pay back, to subsidize a broken health care system instead of fixing it.

He learned the sound of boots that kicked for fun versus boots that kept moving because a man couldn’t afford to stop. He never used the same corner twice.

Hi all, I hope this post is okay, as I would really love some outsider feedback. I don't really post to Reddit much, so apologies if I get some etiquette wrong. And please let me know if I can give more details anywhere in my post.

I should say I also plan to bring this up with my therapist, too, once I work through some other stuff. At the minute there isn't really anyone in my life I can admit this to and just want to gain some clarity before I go back to work next week.

This may be a big read, I apologise, but the title summarises, and I have tried to be as concise as possible without omitting too many details.

**What I'd like to discuss is: is attraction plausible here, if so what is a good way to navigate this relationship going forward, what to expect, and has anyone had similar experiences? Any advice will be much appreciated.**

...

So I won't lie, and it feels pretty silly at my age, but I have a bit of a crush on a colleague. I'll name him Jim for the purposes of this post. Jim is 30M and would rank as my boss' boss, but he does not directly manage my team except in the absence of my boss. But I acknowledge he is a superior.

I have had a crush on him for the last year, since we met, but thought nothing more of it. It died off a bit, but has reignited over the last 5 or 6 months.

I have grown to really admire him in the way he carries himself at work, work ethic, humour and overall kindness, thoughtfulness and demeanour. I believe there is some chemistry between us, but it could be platonic. Everyone in the office gets on well together. Everyone is super likeable and decent. But I get a different feeling from him.

I'm going to list things I have noticed throughout our relationship, and was wondering if I could hone in on whether there is romantic/sexual attraction or ""more than friends"" feelings.  These are in a roughly chronological order.

I know there is no way to 100% guarantee attraction without directly asking, but I'd like to figure out how to navigate going forward. As a young woman, I have had several men express interest in me in recent years, but unfortunately, I did not reciprocate their feelings. The patterns those men have displayed have appeared again in Jim and his behaviour around me, although he appears to have a more respectful restraint on escalating. Some of these read as normal, ""supportive manager"", office/platonic things, but I'm including them anyway, just in case.

*Just a note: I was not ""pretty"" or popular growing up. I hope I don't come off as presumptuous. I am just as confused with Jim's behaviour as I have been with any man interested in me, haha.*

**1**. I had a situation at work where I was uncomfortable being around another coworker. Jim, for the next few months following that, was regularly checking in with me regarding it, as this other coworker still had to work closely with me. Jim would check in regularly and actively arrange tasks so that I could have space until I voiced that the situation was resolved and I was no longer uncomfortable. During this situation, Jim commended me on different occasions on my professionalism and said he admired how I handled things.

**2.** When Jim and I see each other at work, we will have intervals of light-hearted banter, ask about our work and our day, weekend plans, and holiday plans. Make each other tea/coffee. Occasionally get lunch together. On the surface, a standard friendly/professional relationship. I keep my answers short, again just trying to keep it friendly, as I'm aware of the ""butterflies"" I get at the moment. But I notice he does try very hard to keep conversations going, finding anything to talk about, and he will only stop when someone needs him for something, gets called away, etc.

**3**. When I first met him on my interview day, I saw him in the office and said I thought he was a celebrity. My colleagues have said he was absolutely glowing the rest of the day; he was so happy to have heard that. Really made his week. It was a funny moment that people (him included) still reference, to tease and embarrass me.

**4**. We are often on the same wavelength, finish each other's sentences, make the same jokes, and share core values. I know that sounds vague, but it's a frequent occurrence that I can't articulate better at this time

**5**. I have also noticed he tends to be in my peripheral, and tends to linger around in proximity to me - he'll join me for lunch shortly after I go to the lunch room without me inviting him, or get up and make tea/coffee in the kitchen shortly after I do. Sometimes it does feel like an excuse to hi and to ask what I'm working on, etc.

**6**. I have caught him staring a good few times as well, even when not directly in conversation with me, or from across the room, which is passed off with a polite smile before turning away.

**7.** I like to bake and share treats with the office; he is usually one of the first to give compliments to the chef. Jim has often made a point of telling me how much he loves the brownies and cookies I make, and how it inspires him to go home and make his own.

**8**. I had to do a public presentation in front of 1-200 people, and he would often offer help in preparation for it. I politely declined to avoid a 1-to-1 interaction, and also, my own manager was already gonna help me with it.

**9.** (Mentioned previously) Jim routinely checked in on me when I had a personal problem earlier in the year, and he would pull me aside into a private room to make sure I was okay.

**10.** Once, my car broke down. And he offered to take me 40 mins out of his way after work, to go collect it from the mechanic. Which was super nice of him. He was going to get some fast food I had never had, and he was insisting I should try it, but didn't outright invite me (?). This drive was one of the times he commended me on my determination and work ethic, he said how much he admired me for taking on so much in my life - study, hobbies, working full time and able to do a ""good job at all of it"".

*So, this is where things started to feel different:*

**11. The Chirstmas Party.**

I had a work Christmas outing in the city. It was a long day; I was there from 9 am until maybe 1 am. It was a day of organisation roundups, achievements, dinner and a fun trivia quiz, and then everyone went for drinks in town. I didn't really speak to Jim much until we went for drinks. I followed my manager, a couple of colleagues and my head of department to the bar next door, where he was buying everyone drinks. I sat down beside my manager and began talking to her and some of the other women, etc. Then, Jim sits down next to me. He is talking to someone else at the table most of the time, but we are all kinda talking to each other a bit too, mingling, as any group of friends would.

For a good few minutes, his leg has been pressed against mine, and neither of us says anything. Maybe he doesn't notice? I don't want to embarrass him or call him out? I move my leg away, assuming he didn't intend the physical touch. Then his foot touches mine a couple of times. Not in a suggestive way, just like little friendly toe taps, and his foot gently resting on top of mine.

Whatever - I don't think he realises.

I reposition myself as subtly as I can, but a few minutes pass, and I realise his leg is still ever so slightly touching mine. I look at him and laugh it off, but he's not looking at me, he's talking to someone else still, so maybe he really just doesn't realise this whole time.

The night continues, and we share a few laughs and stories. I did some paintings as Christmas gifts for some colleagues who were now quite drunk and parading them around. Jim was amazed at them and said I was very talented, that the paintings were beautiful, etc., and he mentioned his dogs (as in he would love a portrait of them). He kept bringing it up during the night, and we had lots of discussions about how we are all creative in our own ways. I was a little embarrassed but grateful for the praise.

Later, I got up to see if anyone wanted more drinks. I offered everyone there a drink to which they declined. Jim overheard and says ***HE'LL*** buy ***ME*** one. I said no, because I was the one offering for the table. But he insisted. He practically ran to the bar to get there before me. He knew my order and brought his and my drink over. He handed me the drink, and his hand brushed mine for maybe a second longer than it should have. I was a bit buzzed. Maybe things just felt like slow motion at the time. I said thanks, and we continued to mingle with the group.

Again, we finished our drinks. I offered to buy a round, and again he said no, he would get me another drink. And again, as he handed me the drink, he brushed my hand with his again.

Neither of us acknowledged it. I thanked him for the drink and continued the conversation with the others.

It might be worth pointing out that I was with him in the group for the rest of the night, and he did not buy anyone else drinks.

At one point, Jim began teasing me for my height in the group. He is a foot or more taller than me, and walked around crouching down at my height, ""amazed"" by how different my world was.

We left the bar and stood outside another venue, mingling with other people, etc. But he would always end up beside me, and his shoulder, arm, hand or leg was usually slightly touching mine. Maybe he was cold? Standing close to get warm?

Again, he made sure a drink was in my hand at all times, lol.

Eventually, people went to get food, etc. I sat away from him at this point while we ate, then he ended up beside me again while queueing for another bar.

Some girls behind me were accusing me of skipping the queue. I was just following my friends; I honestly did not see them and don't remember if I skipped or not, but I apologised. I said they could go ahead of me if it mattered that much to them, and they still continued to give us a hard time about it. Jim intervened, he talked down to them, said we all joined the queue at the same time, and then pushed me out of their way a bit. I don't know where they went after that, but I appreciated him stepping in, as I don't deal well with confrontation, especially when I had already tried to de-escalate.

After this, I realised the last train for the night would be leaving soon, so I said I would leave to go catch it. He and 2 other colleagues offered to walk me to the train station, so we did. At the station, the two other colleagues left, but Jim waited with me there for about 30 mins then his ride came, and my train shortly after. We shared some more laughs and recounted our highlights of the night. I shared some personal thoughts about the job as my contract ends in a few months. I said I'd miss the people a lot. Jim said, ""Which people?"" with an expectant tone, and I realised.. I would miss *him*, mostly - his friendship and support had meant a lot to me over the past year. But I didn't say that. I just laughed it off and said ""everyone"", generally. His whole demeanour softened, and he said he would be sorry to see me go. He had a phone call, and he looked down at it, hesitated, then went to ignore it. I said, ""Should you get that?"" And then he sort of shrugged and begrudingly answered. It was his ride.

He lingered for an extra couple of minutes. He said I was a great person with a lot to offer and that he was glad to have spent the night with me rather than ""some other people"". He insisted on a goodbye hug, which he thanked me for, before going on his way. I was thinking about the fact that I was the only one he hugged goodbye that night. The fact that he asked for a hug... and then *thanked* me for it. And that was the first time I was that physically close to him.

I have been thinking about him and those interactions a lot since.

I know these feelings are normal on my end, but I still feel guilty as I am uncertain about workplace romance. I am pretty sure I do like him, and I am very interested in getting to know him on a deeper level, as a person, but hesitant to initiate that interest. Again, I have no intention to pursue; I just want to gain some clarity so I can prepare for other interactions.

Since then, Jim has pulled back a bit, and I haven't seen a lot of him recently. However, when I do see him, he:

**12**. Gets very excited to talk to me at the end of a workday, when most people have gone home. We end up chatting and laughing together for 10-30 minutes after we are meant to go home. He loves to chat about movies and video games and about weekend plans, which often comes across as normal, friendly conversation, and he often says he will ""let me know"" and will follow up with previous conversations the next week. Our goodbyes tend to linger as we continue chatting on our way out, and hover by the office doors before we go to our cars.

**13.** We work jobs that require outdoor work, and I was carrying heavy equipment. I am not very strong. I am small/lightweight myself, so I kept losing my balance on the terrain. We would laugh about it, how the equipment was nearly carrying *me*, but I felt his hand on the small of my back a few times when I would nearly fall over. I noticed he didn't do the same for others who carried the same equipment and were struggling.

**14**. Another thing I have noticed is the ""eyebrow raise"" whenever he sees me. While not a sure sign of attraction, I have heard it is common. Not reading much into that

**15**. Jim will ask me specifically if I liked his workshops and presentations and for feedback on them. He will usually pull me aside for 1 to 1 feedback

**16.** He has shared some personal reflections and doubts with me in private about his work relationships and project problems he has been dealing with, including other teams and his own boss. He gave me the impression he didn't have opportunity to talk about those things with others, so I was happy to listen.

**17.** He once gave me some chocolate without asking after I told him about my bad day at work. Just a nice interaction  I think about.

**18**. In group settings he will often look at or stare at me even if I am not directly involved in the conversation, or he will mention me by name/invite me into conversation if I haven't said anything in a while.

....

I know these signs do not guarantee attraction, but I would like to work this out so I can navigate the relationship with a bit more confidence going forward and prepare myself mentally for whatever outcome. To reiterate, I have no intention to pursue at this time and plan to maintain a warm and friendly approach as I have always done for everyone I work with. Since he would technically be a superior, that is another thing entirely and a good enough reason for me not to escalate things.

Thank you for taking the time to read if you did.

There may be other encounters I have missed or forgotten about but will update if I think of anything, or if there's anything else I can add or expand on please message or comment.. advice is welcomed and appreciated immensely!

ever since i moved in 1½ years ago, Andrew has been extremely energetic and loud in group meetings. the group meetings happen once a week and last sound 2 hours.

in the last few weeks Andrew has gotten more extreme in his behaviour. he louder, he interrupts people more often with things he already said, he keeps repeating phrases and sentences. he's recently started to leave rhe group to entirely for 15-20 minutes to ""drink his coffee"", which he could very well do at the table with the rest of us. he started doing that 2-3 times each group meeting and he only gets more repetitive in his conversation each time. 

one of my other roomates said that he suspects Andrew is taking drugs (eveyone lnowbhe smokes weed, which the social workers tolerate and ignore even if it goes against the constract). ive started to believe it too, with his increase in irratic behaviour and him dropping household chores as well as accusing me of stealing his food. 

we had a whole meeting about the food situation and he kept changing the topic, tried to leave 3 minutes in and was extremely insistent that he needed to go smoke right there and then, even if he's only in the meeting for 10 minutes. 

i just dont know what to make of him or his behaviour. i dont want to ""rat him out"" to the social workers, but i really need some insight from people who might know what that kind of behaviour means. ",1,1770512785.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1qyv2rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueCollarWomen/comments/1qyv2rm/my_supervisor_is_bullying_me_and_im_not_sure_how/,My supervisor is bullying me and I'm not sure how to handle it,"Mid 30s female here. Just hoping to get some strategic advice.

I recently started working as a construction laborer. I do not have a trades background at all, but I have worked physically demanding jobs and long hours before and prefer manual labor over working in an office. I applied for construction, because I had been curious about it for a couple of years and finally just decided to give it a go rather than regretting it for the rest of my life.

The position I applied for was ""construction worker, no prior experience needed"", so pretty perfect for me actually. I got invited to an interview and the boss told me that they had actually already filled the position with 2 guys who do have prior experience, but that no woman had ever applied for the job before and if I was keen, he'd be willing to give me a chance and we could see how it goes. I'm just mentioning this to make clear that I didn't take the job from someone more capable or whatever, but rather that there was an extra opening created for me, obviously so the company can brag about being inclusive.

Overall, it's been a good 3 months. I'm learning something new every day and the majority of guys have been nice so far. As a laborer, you get send to wherever extra help is needed and I've worked on 4 different sites for now. On a little side note, I find it super exhausting to not have a fixed team. As I've mentioned before, I'm the only woman in a company of about 40 workers, so the guys I haven't met yet are all curious about me, but also super reserved and full of prejudice at times and it's really exhausting to find my place over and over again in a new team, only to be ripped away and start all over again. Especially because I never get a warm welcome, but always just reserved distance at first. I'm glad I'm coming into this as a 30-something-year-old with a solid amount of prior life and work experience in shitty as well as great places and teams, so I know the difference. But let's get to the point.

There is one supervisor who is actually causing me anxiety. This guy is just a cunt. He's the picture perfect narcissist. Everything he does is perfect, everything the others do is less-than. Mistakes are never his fault. He needs to fill silence at any cost. But even when there is no silence, he needs to be the one talking. Any topic you talk about, he has done it before and knows everything better, and if not, he will steer the conversation to something he can talk about. Criticism against him is not valid and needs to be avenged. Oh, and he's a control freak of course. 

This guy is trying to break me down in one form or another every single day and it's exhausting. I've been quite open and clear to him from the start about not having prior experience, but that I'm really keen to learn and that I best learn by doing and just being shown instead of explained. That I need to see, in addition to being explained to understand. 

Now it's happened a bunch of times that he will tell me to do a certain task, no explaining, he just goes: ""Well, just do it how you think it should be done."" And I'm like: ""No problem, just show me once and I'll do it."", and this guy literally refuses to show me. He just wants me to make a fool of myself. Or he will only explain stuff super quickly, without showing me and then walk away. Or he will put the machinery in a difficult spot for someone my size to lift and then just stand there and watch me struggle and make some stupid ass comment and laugh. When I work with him one on one he's actually a nice enough guy, but once the other guys are there, he turns into this performative alpha prick.

I'm new. I'm not from the trades. I make mistakes. But he comments on every little thing. All the fucking time. And it's really starting to get to me. The other day him and another guy were working up on a scissor lift and he told me to wait on the ground so that if they needed tools, I could throw them up to them, which I did. Then at the end of the day he goes: ""Must be nice to just stand around all day and not actually do any work."" Like wtf. He is literally setting me up to not meet his (unspoken) expectations. Another day I brought in some croissants in the morning as a treat. Unfortunately, they were not the best and a bit stale. But this guy did not just tell me once, right then and there, that they were not really good, oh no, he told me on another 2 days that the croissants I had brought in had been super disappointing. Like wtf my guy, where I'm from you say thank you and then you shut the fuck up. On one of my first days we had to wait out the rain, so he made coffees for everybody. I had told him even before going into our break room that he didn't have to make one for me, because if I drank coffee this late I wouldn't be able to sleep. Once in the break room, he put a coffee down in front of me and told me to drink it. I said thanks, but not for me. During the break and whilst chatting with the other people he told me probably another 5 times to drink the coffee. I didn't. He finally put it down in front of another guy and told him to have it. He did.

I generally get along with the other guys and we got some great banter. Two of them even told me that they really enjoy having me on site, and that the supervisor has actually been a lot nicer since I'm there. I can also tell the difference between banter and a straight up attempt at bullying. I am not used to these power games though. Especially because I don't understand why he needs to assert dominance in all these situations, when I never questioned his authority in the first place. I know he knows the job and I don't. I know he's the lead of the team. I literally do what he asks me to do, to the best of my capabilities. I am also calling him out for this shit, which he doesn't like and usually he will tell me not to be so aggressive or he pouts and repays me by doing everything he can to make me feel stupid. It's exhausting. Especially because I AM stupid when it comes to this job. It's legit handicapping my progress and ability to learn and I cannot become secure in a task if he is constantly doing his best to destabilize me.

Before you say that I should report him, I was actually sent to a different site last week. The team, including the supervisor, seemed genuinely upset I was leaving and tried to keep me on the old site, but the boss insisted. But I'm literally replaying some of the situations in my head every day and I just feel myself getting so angry. Also, the current project is a short one and there is a good chance I'll be sent back to the other site again after, which is why I keep replaying the scenarios in my head to try and find the best way to handle this type of person in the future.



So, I guess I am just hoping for a bit of advice and lore on how to work under a bully supervisor?



TL:DR - Started working in construction a few months ago and one of my supervisors enjoys bullying me. The anxiety has started to take a toll on my mental health.

For a long time, I was stuck in ""Spreadsheet Hell""—duplicating the same Google Sheet every month, manually typing in every single coffee or software subscription, and never having a dashboard that actually showed me where my money was going.

I wanted something fast and beautiful. So, I built **Finoria**.

**What it does right now:**

* **Beautiful Dashboard:** A clean visual overview of monthly spending (way better than any Excel chart).
* **Quick Add:** Designed to add transactions in seconds so I actually stay consistent.
* **Banking API (Beta):** I’ve already tested a banking API integration to automate the boring stuff.

I initially built this for myself and some friends in the German market to get some early validation. Now, I’m at a crossroads on how to turn this into a sustainable SaaS.

**The Pivot Idea:** While it’s great for personal use, I’ve noticed massive chaos in the companies I consult for. Most small B2B teams have zero structure and absolute chaos when it comes to tracking operational expenses and predictability.

I’d love your ""MicroSaaS"" brain on this:

1. **Price Point:** If you were to use this personally or for your freelance business, what’s a ""no-brainer"" price for you? What’s the one feature that would make you pay for it instantly? Or would you personall not pay for that and why? 
2. **Current Pain:** If you’re already using a tool (or still stuck in Excel like I was), what’s the thing that annoys you the most about your current setup?

I believe I do have an anxiety disorder and/or ocd but I have never been evaluated. Since last year in June, I started taking thc gummies to help me relax and sleep some nights.  (fyi: I NEVER do this alone with my kids. I take this at night after they sleep and if they happen to be awake, there is always a sober adult such as my husband and in laws that care for them. Just thought I should throw this in there). There are some periods that I didn’t take it or some where I was taking it every night but everytime I took it, I was fine. Everything was ok. Well that all changed this past Thursday night…

So on Thursday morning, I drunk a cup of coffee that made me jittery and anxious but it passed. Later that day when my husband got home, I asked him if it was ok if I could take a gummy since I was feeling overwhelmed due to current world events (the Epstein files and just generally everything going on caused by the trump administration. And if you are supporter of his then I don’t want your advice). He gave me the ok and I took the gummy and then hit the shower. I started to feel the effects of the gummy getting out of the shower and I sat with my husband in the living room. That’s when I started to feel extremely anxious. I started getting intrusive thoughts. Just AWFUL thoughts that I don’t want to go into detail about. I realized that I was having a hard time stopping the thoughts and started to panic. That’s when I went into my room and began pacing back and forth trying to calm myself down. I even started asking God to help me and told him I would stop using the gummies. My heart was racing very fast which made it worse because I thought I was dying. I even began getting intrusive thoughts that I was going to die in just a few minutes. It was TERRIFYING. I began trying to cope by telling myself  that as long as I’m here and breathing that I was OK. I then began naming things around my room to help me because it hit me that what I’m experiencing is an intense anxiety attack. I called my husband and asked him to come into the room because I was having an anxiety attack. By the time he came in, I began shaking from how anxious I was. He then laid next to me in bed and was helping me do breathing exercises which did help. I stayed in this state, shaking on and off, until I finally fell asleep. Waking up the next morning, I still felt anxious. I wasn’t high anymore but just anxious. I walked my son to school which I felt fine to do. My mom picked up my other child because I am recovering from a back injury so she was helping me care for her during the day. Well, when they left, I began feeling EXTREMELY anxious like I did the previous night. I wasn’t shaking but my brain just wouldn’t STOP. I was overthinking to the max and getting really bad intrusive thoughts. I was so anxious that I began feeling nauseous and could barely get myself to eat. I have never felt such crippling anxiety in my life. Fast forward to today, I still feel extremely anxious but now I also feel numb and almost like I’m looking through a lens. My husband has been taking care of my kids all day because all I’m able to do is lay in bed. I looked into what I could be experiencing and derealization was one thing that google suggested I may be experiencing. 

How long does this last? Will I ever be normal again?  What can I do to help reduce this?? When is it time to see a professional for help? Does anxiety medication help? 

Overall I am ashamed of myself because I am a mother and I don’t want to feel like this. I just want to be normal again.

The reason is that over the last few months I’ve consistently been gaining weight. I’ve been on this journey before. At one point I used to be very fat. Then I lost a lot of weight. When I was fit, I felt like a completely different person. Everything around me changed. My energy levels, the activities I was doing, the activities I wanted to do, how I showed up in my own life, and how I felt about myself and everything around me.

Right now I feel bloated, unhappy, lethargic, and complacent. My energy levels are down. It’s affecting my emotions, my mental health, pretty much everything. So I’m going to take a big step, something that’s been on my mind for a very long time. I know it’s not easy, especially right now, because I’ve been relying a lot on food for emotional comfort. That’s been counterproductive. It feels good in the moment, but later I feel even more sluggish and worse overall.

To break this cycle, I’m doing something drastic. I’m doing a 3-day fast. During this time I’ll be having water, black coffee, black or green tea, and my vitamins and supplements. Nothing with calories. I’m hopeful I’ll get through this. I’m taking it one day at a time.

Here’s a well‑crafted, engaging Reddit post written *in the same tone and rhythm* as your examples, but centered on **“coloring book adult pdf.”** It blends honesty, relatability, and a value‑driven message to connect with adult creatives and mindfulness seekers on r/pinteresttrends.

**When’s the last time you colored without overthinking it? 🖍️✨**

I don’t mean “doing something creative.”  
I mean really coloring — like zoning out, sipping your coffee, filling in petals and shapes, and letting your brain *breathe*.

Most of us stopped when we became “busy adults.”  
But what if the thing we need most… is actually the same thing that calmed us as kids?

Coloring isn’t childish — it’s one of the most underrated forms of self‑care out there.

Here’s what I learned after creating a **coloring book adult PDF** designed specifically for people who want to decompress without a massive time commitment:  

• 🧠 Coloring slows racing thoughts (hello, meditation without the silence pressure).  
• 🎨 It activates creativity without demanding perfection.  
• 💛 And it’s screen‑free time that still feels *rewarding*, not guilty pleasure.  

I’ve heard from teachers, designers, and parents — people who felt anxious or overstimulated until they picked up colored pencils again.  
Some use it while listening to podcasts. Others print a few pages and color before bed. All say the same thing: *“It’s peaceful.”*

That’s why I decided to share this adult coloring experience for free — no gatekeeping, no catch.  
If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed or creatively stuck, this might surprise you in the best way.

You’ll get soothing mandala pages, nature patterns, and simple abstract lines — perfectly balanced between calm and challenge.

Ten minutes might sound small, but it’s often enough to reset your entire mood.

I fall into the latter category and so does this guy I'll call Joe. The undergrads were two girls Lucy and Ashley, both 21. Joe is 33 and my age doesn't really matter here. 

We were working on a research project that's how the four of us kind of met. Joe is naturally charismatic, confident, so naturally he became the leader and then yeah both girls started competing over him. 

Ash used to show up early, an hour before and just sit there with him. He would put in 99% of the work she'd do less than 1% but she'd be there everyimewe showed up for our weekly meetings. 

They grew close naturally so he made a move. I won't comment on the age gap here but that's not what's important. She then claimed she had a boyfriend, Ash did and after that just spiraled. This was last spring.

So fall the three of us ended up sharing a class again. Ash, Joe and I. Our university has some classes which undergrads and grad students can take. 

The first week everything was good, we got along well but then something happened between Ash and Joe. Basically what I found out was that she tried resetting, flirting with him again acting like nothing had happened between them. He was tired of her hiding behind her feelings so he sent her a text, telling her he liked her and that he held no hard feelings after what happened. He showed me the text and that was back in September. Since then she's been running out of the class anytime he gets close. Always acts like she's in flight or fight mode. And other weird things. 

There is a lot more which goes past general weirdness but it involves her keeping tabs on him. I won't mention how since I am not posting this to have her get bashed. 

So the reason this matters is this spring the four of us have resumed our project. The professor we worked with had to take some time off due to personal reasons. Joe is still the leader but Ash won't even talk to him. Him and Lucy have been getting along great, last Spring she was hurt he asked out Ash instead of her because Ash told her but this semester she's been way more productive and contributing a lot. 

Ash just keeps giving Joe the cold shoulder, or acting extremely immature. Joe, Lucy and I have talked about Ash's behaviour and we all agree that it's extremely weird. All he did was ask her out for coffee and somehow this has escalated in a way none of us could have imagined. 

So yes, Joe has tried to talk to Ashley that was the whole point of the text but she just sent an emoji instead. He said hello to her a few times hoping he could talk to her and she ran out of the class. 

She won't tell Lucy what is wrong either, nor does she tell me. She just prefers skipping the meetings, or doing little to nothing when she shows up

Yes, we could replace her, or kick her out of the group we even talked to the professor but he told us to sort it out. So that would have been an option if we knew what was up with her but she won't talk.

And no, Joe hasn't approached her to talk since October. During meetings nowadays he just acts like she isn't there in response to her doing the same.

The only thing Joe knows for sure is that she lied about the boyfriend. A mutual friend of hers had told him. So we don't know if she feels guilty, ashamed for lying or what.

My dad mistakenly ordered a different topping and they only got to realize that when it arrived. That's when my mom knocked on my door and with the sweetest tone explained to me what happened, she handed me her phone an said I could order whatever I wanted.  
 I broke. The tears started running through my face as I stood there not knowing how to react.

I think after events of the Final SMG4 movie SMG3 just probably returned to running Coffee N' Bombs plus maybe hanging out with Wario & the WarioWare crew well the ones who have 3D models anyway thanks to Smash Bros some them do have Models 

with that last part in mind I imagine SMG3 would probably get a motorcycle to like Wario something a little more safer then a Motorcycle like moped actually yeah I can see SMG3 getting a Mopad a purple one he still hangs out with the rest of the SMG4 Crew maybe working on his channel now that SMG4 is retired 

probably he goes on his own mini adventures to finish his arc as a reform Villain well not completely but close enough like Eddie Brock when he became the King in Black meaning he still blows up stuff & does villain things but he comes to terms with it more or less

1qyusav,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeelBetterDaily/comments/1qyusav/low_stamina_lately_try_this_3_signs_test_and_a/,Low stamina lately? Try this “3 signs” test (and a simple 7-day reset),"Have you ever had days where you’re not exactly “sick”… but your body feels like it’s running on 60%? Stairs feel harder, workouts feel heavier, and even simple errands feel like effort.

https://preview.redd.it/krwegllz46ig1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f854e48351e2e27a64969ae836eb594e7d280c27

Before you jump to supplements or blame age, try this quick check. It helps you figure out *why* your stamina feels low — and what to do first.

# The 3-Signs Test (takes 30 seconds)

**Sign #1: You get winded faster than usual**  
Not “out of shape” — just noticeably faster than your normal.

**Sign #2: You feel better after you move**  
You start the day sluggish, but a short walk makes you feel more “awake.”

**Sign #3: Your body feels heavy, not sleepy**  
It’s not that you want to nap. It’s more like your muscles feel “flat.”

If you have **2 out of 3**, a common pattern is:  
✅ low daily movement + hydration + inconsistent sleep + “stuck” circulation habits (sitting a lot).

Not a diagnosis — just a very common modern lifestyle combo.



# The 7-Day Stamina Reset (simple, realistic)

# 1) The “10-minute rule” (daily)

Walk 10 minutes after your biggest meal.  
If you can’t: 5 minutes after two meals.

# 2) Water before caffeine (daily)

One full glass of water first. Then coffee.

# 3) Add “flow foods” 3x this week

Pick one: **beets, arugula, spinach, celery, pomegranate**  
(You don’t have to be perfect — just include them.)

# 4) One strength “micro-session” (3x this week)

Pick ONE:

* 2 sets of squats
* 2 sets of pushups (wall is fine)
* 2 sets of lunges That’s it. Done in 5 minutes.

# 5) Sleep anchor (7 days)

Choose a consistent **wake-up time**. Even if bedtime isn’t perfect.

# Where nitric oxide fits (optional, not a magic fix)

If your pattern is more “heavy/low stamina,” some people explore nitric oxide support because it’s involved in blood vessel relaxation and circulation. I’m sharing this as a resource (not medical advice):

[Check it out Here.](https://www.digistore24.com/redir/538695/karimsalah97/)

  
*If you’re on blood pressure meds, heart meds, or managing a condition, check with a clinician first.*

# Quick question (so I can tailor this):

Which one describes you most right now?

**A)** Stairs feel harder than they used to  
**B)** Workouts feel heavier than normal  
**C)** I feel better after I move, but I start sluggish  
**D)** I’m tired + sleepy all day (different issue)

1qyurtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1qyurtc/budget_challenge_no_take_out_from_a_restaurant/,Budget Challenge: No take out from a restaurant for all of 2026,"I'll start with the rules I follow, then I'll go into what inspired this. 

My rules are:

1. No take out from restaurants (obviously)
2. I can buy pre-made food from grocery stores (so like, I can buy a 5 dollar rotisserie chicken, sandwiches, or fried chicken from supermarket deli's, but i havent done this yet)
3. Buying food from the discount cafes at the supermarkets are also allowed (so Costco or Sam's club cafes are allowed to get food from since the cost there is so low. You can get a massive 3 meat pizza from Sam's club Cafe for literally 9 dollars, but again, i haven't done this yet)


So, I started this kinda on a whim after the last time I got take out, on 12/15/25. I went to Dunkin Donuts, and a large iced coffee and 25 munchkins was almost 15 bucks. 

Later that same day, I went to Aldi, and saw they have donut holes, 28 for $2.99, and pre-made caramel machiato or mocha coffees for $3.50 for a half gallon. I realized in that moment that for what I paid for breakfast just 1 morning, I can get for a whole week at Aldi. It was at that very moment I decided, okay, no more eating out for a while to save some money to get out of some debt that i am in.

To keep myself going, I started looking up easy meals to prep, and take out dupe recipies to help with cravings. I will say, having things like an air fryer, instant pot pressure cooker, and rice cooker has helped me immensely, and made cooking faster and less daunting for me, which has helped me stick to this so far. 

Anyway, during the holidays, my first big recipe dupe i tried to make was one of my favorite Chinese take out food, boneless spare ribs. I bought a 4lb half pork loin for about 8 dollars at Aldi, cut it into chops, then cut the chops into 2 inch strips. I then marinated them in 3/4 of a jar of pre-made Chinese BBQ sauce overnight. (Note: I could have made the sauce myself, but getting all the ingredients would have been more expensive and I live with roommates, so my space is limited in the cupboard we have. Plus, it was a lot less work and less discouraging.)

I pressure cooked the marinated pork in the instant pot for about 65 minutes, then after took the cooked pork, poured it into a disposable pan, added the remaining 1/4 of the sauce, and broiled the meat for about 5 minutes to give it that classic char the dish usually has. I then made about 8 cups of white rice in the rice cooker with some chicken bullion powder I already had on hand added to the rice water to help flavor the rice. I was able to make about 8 large meal prep bowls of Char Siu (Chinese boneless spare ribs) with white rice, and here is the cost breakdown:

4lb half loin: $8
Chinese BBQ sauce: $8 (yea, not cheap, but totally worth the flavor and cheaper than buying the ingredients to make it from scratch)
White Rice: $2
Total: $18 
Cost per serving: $2.25

Even with the lunch special, its about $8-$10 per serving at a take out place, so I was able to make 8 servings for what I would have paid for 2 servings.

It was so much easier than I was expecting, and that's when I realized. I can do this. I can stick to this and make this work long term. So the no take out rule went from for a while, to the entire year of 2026.


The goal of this is to save money in a sustainable way. I am trying to make this a habit, so it becomes less of something I have to do, and is something that is just everyday life. Fast food, take out, going to sit down restaurants, etc used to be something I would do frequently, and looking back I realize the time I save isn't worth the money I have spent, at least while I'm trying to save money and get out of debt. I have done this now for almost 2 months, which I know may sound like nothing, but for me its developing habits around making sound financial decisions with food, which is (embarassingly) new to me.

I’m making this post to try to help, because I know how many doubts and anxiety this topic creates in our minds.

Here’s the thing: I’ve tried many different things to understand what works and what doesn’t, but I always believed that if we have **chronic halitosis**, then something is wrong — and no product would truly treat it the way we want.

So I decided to do the opposite.

I always used the smell of my tongue as a “test”, but I know that’s not reliable. The truth is: our tongue naturally has its own characteristic smell, just like earwax or armpits.

Then I asked myself something that I think many people here have thought before:

**What if something we use every day is actually causing (or worsening) the halitosis?**

First, I cut coffee (it’s been over a month). I can’t really say if it helped.

But the biggest change was when I started using **baking soda** and only that. I stopped using toothpaste completely, and that was the key to many changes in my life.

I didn’t use baking soda in every brushing, and even so, I felt like my teeth were super clean just using the toothbrush alone.

My tongue almost doesn’t build up coating anymore, and before I had a LOT.

One thing I noticed, and maybe it was a strong sign of where my halitosis was coming from, was those little “skins” that form on our lips when they get dry. I believe some ingredient in my toothpaste was causing this with chronic use.

After one week without toothpaste and brushing with only baking soda (or just brushing normally), I noticed a huge difference.

I used to feel a bad smell on my toothbrush, and now it’s gone.

Another thing I forgot to mention is that I also drank a tiny amount of baking soda mixed with water. I can’t say if it helped, but I’m sharing everything I did.

Overall, what I want to say is:

**less is more.**

And maybe for many of us, halitosis is being worsened by something we use that is disrupting our oral microbiome and making the problem even worse.

In my case, I truly believe toothpaste was my biggest villain.

Now I need to find a toothpaste that doesn’t contain **sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)**.Just a reminder: **baking soda should NOT be used every day.**  
I used it **once every 3 days**.

I liked it so much that I bought a **much finer baking soda with micro-particles**, so the risk of scratching/damaging enamel is lower.

Tip: there are very fine baking soda powders used even in dental offices, and you can find them online.",3,1770511893.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False

1qyuljn,https://i.redd.it/yvf3v1of36ig1.png,Really Struggling Now - Here's to the forecast,"Hey guys,

I know I'm not the only one who's been finding the winter challenging lately.

Today I went to see my old friend - his 3 cats have been sleeping almost all day for weeks - they don't want to go outside (he lives in the countryside so they are usually outdoor cats).

One of them - who goes out the most - looks very restless. He looks longingly out the window constantly.

I then went for a coffee with my other friend, who told me he is finding it mentally challenging - despite having made more progress in the gym than ever (he recently found new momentum in his gym-goings and has been an avid gym-goer for a long time, with a wife and kids too.)

I personally remember here in Dundee the last time I saw the sun or at least remember the morning being light was the 19th January - when I walked into town for my first day at my new office job, who pay me well and has been relaxed. Ever since then just being alive has been hell. It was tough before the 19th Jan already with the short days - but the weeks following have been the worst of all. And it seems never-ending.

I have my SAD lamp in the morning. I got up at a decent time today (Saturday). I have a good job, paid well. I saw my good old friend at his house with his cats, then saw my other good friend for a coffee. We laughed and shared. Then I immediately went to the gym and did a proper workout. And then I walked home, and drank a lot of water. 

And despite all that, I feel absolutely miserable. A horrible emptiness in my stomach. (I've done all the therapy and meditation stuff too by the way.)

So miserable that when I got home and watched a movie with my girlfriend through video chat, I wanted to cry the whole time.

I genuinely can't take this any more.

I ended up drinking a bunch of whisky, which I know won't help long term. But I usually don't drink. I just can't take this grey and dark any more.

For those of you who say ""wrap up and look for the positives in Winter. Hygge."" Fuck you. I did my SAD lamp, ate healthily, saw 2 friends today, went to the gym, and watched a happy movie with my girlfriend. Suck my dick.

I'm not doing this again next Winter. Here's to the next week's forecast - which is probably bullshit frankly. Thank you and goodnight.",6,1770511445.0,UKWeather,5,0.88,False

A month into me and my ex being back my crush reached out and became interested in m. Because I was unsure about trusting my ex again despite him not giving me a reason, I called things off with him and start talking to my crush.

I confronted him and he told how he had messed up reaching out to me but he couldn’t hold back because he thinks about me everyday and how it might be too late for us to get back together because him and his girlfriend had introduced each other to families and friends and he is now being pressured by her to get engaged soon so its too late to get out of that relationship. What bugs me about this whole situation is that the night before he was talking about marrying me so passionately and the next day he mentioned being forced to get engaged. I did get back with my crush 2-3 months later because i felt so broken after I found that out and needed some support.

This series is starting to feel like torture, a torture to my soul that I'm not sure I can emotionally handle for another *seven* books.

I will be honest and say that I found this book a bit of a slog at first. I was excited to see my GoTM friends again, but I did find all the marching in the first third a bit slow (this is a common thing for me in many fantasy books, so not a criticism at all of Erikson's writing). Picker and Blend carried the Malayan/Brood armies POVs for me, I love them and I would die for them both. 

However, from the start I was fully invested in Toc the Younger's POV with Lady Envy (queen), Tool (my absolute favourite), the Seguleh, and the wolves (little did I know). This was such a fun little adventure, lots of witty banter, bonding... then Toc may have made the dumbest decision I have ever read in my (almost) 27 years of living. I'm sorry, maybe I have it all wrong. Maybe I'm the dumb one. Maybe this is all going to be part of some master plan Toc had that will be revealed to me in future books. But at this point in time, I'm still shaking my head. I know he justified his choice by thinking he was not strong enough to survive, particularly because he was travelling with a group that was so powerful he'd probably just end up being collateral. He also wanted to rejoin Dujek's host, but to join the corpse raping, cannibal army in hopes that he'd just blend in? Toc, there had to be another way my friend... a way that didn't torture both you and me.

Whiskeyjack... I just knew he wasn't surviving the book pretty early on. He was this series Ned Stark type of character and that meant he had to go. Every time his leg was mentioned, every time he built up another friendship or relationship, my heart just got heavier. I do think it was a satisfying and deserving way for him to go, holding onto his morals right til the end. The unnamed marines hurt just as much and my heart broke when Rake offered Moon's Spawn as their resting place. Him and Rake were so good together, I loved the bond they built. Rake is also one of the coolest characters ever and I need to see more of him (and that sword).

Paran really came into his own in this book, which I loved. The blessings he can give are very interesting and I am very intrigued. Him and Quick Ben were are fun duo and I loved the Bridgeburners coming to respect him throughout the story. Quick Ben is also a total badass and I love that he's just going round and causing chaos for the gods. Also, that he blasted those two weirdo summoners. I don't know when they're going to pop up again, but as of now, I am not a fan.

Itkovian... so many tears. I guessed a fair few of the twits in this book but when he stood before the T'lan Imass, I audibly gasped when I realised what was about to happen. He was the betrayer, but only due to his compassion and courage. What a beautifully, tragic story. I ugly cried when everyone came to honour him.

This book felt like it gave me both a lot of lore for the overall series, but a lot of closure for the characters as well. I feel like a few of these characters may not pop up again (at least not in a big way) and if so, I'm satisfied with how their stories ended. The lore is delicious and I love linking things up. When I connect things together, I feel like that meme of Leonardo Dicaprio pointing at the tv going ""Keruli... that name looks like K'rul. It must be him!"". 

Again, the idea that there is no 'good side' or 'bad side' in war. The T'lan Imass were a great example of this. Even the Tenescowri (as filthy and disgusting as they were) really made me think about what the atrocities of war can bring out of humanity, and whose fault that actually is.

Also, major shoutout to whoever has created the guides. I haven't needed them for plot purposes yet, but the fan art of the characters has been vital. So many 'K' names in this book and Erikson doesn't tend to describe physical appearances in great detail, so seeing the little faces has been great. Will be shouting a fair few coffees!

All in all, another incredible book and I now head off to read House of Chains. This was the one I was warned about the character Karsa, and many of you put my unease to rest. Also after what I gathered about the actual House of Chains during this book, this could get very interesting. So here we go!

If most of us trans women have a slow comt and a build up of catechol estrogens well , i dont understand the biochemistry behind needing intermittent oral E2 cycles for my self other wise i stall and i stop feeling estrogenic effects mentally and physically too on just shots. I dose twice a week and keep troughs 120-170pg/ml.

I keep my shbg lower than 120 and i supplement some T now for months to keep my levels into the female range while i noticed benefits doing especially in the boob department avoiding oral E2 cycles stops my feminisation to a degree and the mental effects of the estradiol. One of the symptoms i notice creeping up is dysphoria. Doing the oral E2 every month is too much as i start to feel like is doing the opposite of helping but doing it every 6 weeks helps A LOT.

I didnt test my genes yet but im planning to in the near future , however other clues i have about my biochemistry is that i react very bad to methylated supplements like folate and B12 even if the dose is low.

So, here's the deal. I was on a 4-month streak solving LeetCode problems every day. It felt great — I was making real progress. But then, life hit me hard. My grandma passed away, and it completely knocked me off course.
I was upset, and I just didn’t have the energy to do anything, let alone solve problems. When I finally checked my LeetCode, I saw that my streak was broken, and I was furious. All that hard work for nothing. It felt like I let myself down. I was demotivated and unsure if I wanted to even continue.

But then I realized something — I wasn’t going to just let that be the end. I had spent 4 months building this streak, and I wasn’t going to throw it all away. So, I got to work.

For the next 6 days, I barely slept. I was running on coffee and frustration, trying everything from Playwright automation to different APIs, and even trying to bypass Monaco’s security. But everything I tried either didn’t work or was unreliable.

I also realized that running it on my PC daily wasn’t the best solution. What if I wasn’t home for a couple of days? What if I was out of town? I needed something that could run automatically, without me worrying about my desktop being on.

After two more days of trying and failing, I finally built something that works. It solves my LeetCode problems daily, pushes them to GitHub, and guarantees me 2 contributions every day, even when I’m not actively coding.

Here’s the cool part — it works while I’m sleeping. If my phone is asleep, it wakes it up, unlocks it for one minute, turns on mobile data, performs the task, and then locks the phone again. It runs in the background without me needing to manually start or stop it.

Now, I’m back on track, and my streak is stronger than ever. I still miss my grandma, but this project helped me channel my frustration into something productive, and I feel like I’ve turned a corner.

I just wanted to share this with you guys, because I know we all hit walls sometimes, and it’s easy to feel like you’ve messed up. But you don’t have to quit. You just need to find a way to keep going, even if that means building your own solution.

I’m also thinking of making this into a low-cost tool for others who struggle with staying consistent, if anyone’s interested. But really, this is just me sharing a solution that worked for me in hopes it might help someone else.

Took the time to dilute all my materials to 10% and 1% and smelled all of them on strips. Got pretty confident and made my first formula, and it went pretty well. I was a bit shocked that I made something that actually smelled ""ok"" considering all of the folks saying how you'll make mud. Take that!

With my new found confidence I decided to make another formula. Feeling a bit invincible, I quickly typed it into my app and adjusted the ratios to what I thought were perfectly reasonable levels.

Well, during the blending, I can honestly say, I finally made a scent that literally made me gag. One whiff and I just about lost it.. I accidentally overdosed the cis-3-hexanol by a factor of 10. I think I also used coumarin and the violent smell of dry, sweet hay with gasoline and cut grass literally repulsed me.

Fast forward, and then I overdosed some oakmoss and made such a rancid piss smelling concoction that I had to dump it all in my throw away jar...

C'est la vie!

I guess my beginners luck has come to an end. Though, I did redeem myself with a nice caramel coffee base... but it's probably better as a candle than a fine fragrance.

I'll leave you with my ""Creamy Caramel Coffee"" accord? Base? It's also ""ok"" although a bit unrefined.

I found that a 2 : 1 ratio of coffee to the caramel base delivers a nice ""caramel frappe"" vibe. You can also add a tiny bit of cinnamon to the coffee at a 40 : 1 (coffee : cinnamon bark eo) for a nice boozy cinnamon effect.

Only some annoying jump scares, and scaring me at every corner. I am not the type of person to like those kinds of pranks, but i didn’t wanna say anything about it and just went along with it. It was until a month later, it started getting a bit out of hand. He would scare me in the shower, put fake bugs in my coffee, and literally getting scary masks that almost gave me heart attacks. I would tell him that he wasn’t being funny anymore, and that he needed to stop. But he would just roll his eyes and say that I was being “too serious” and “not having fun with it”. I would tell my friends and family, and I would get mixed reactions from it.

*(Intro — distant sirens, static, a busted lighter sparking, neon hum)*

**Verse 1**  
Under neon flicker and a 3 a.m. sky,  
Coffee-stained flyers paper up the “WHY.”  
You can hear the city breathing through boarded-up glass,  
Revolution’s not coming—  
It’s here at last.

Ash on our boots, and the street sings along,  
Jackals in the alleys, but the night feels strong.  
We aren’t just waiting for daylight applause—  
We’re the ghosts with the guts to rewrite the laws.

**Pre-Chorus**  
We’ve got the hunger, we’ve got the right,  
Taking the world from dark to light.  
New day’s breaking—can you feel the rush?  
We won’t be silenced.  
We won’t hush.

**Chorus**  
This is the revolution, feel the fire in the air,  
We’re taking back what’s ours—no more chains, no despair.  
It’s a movement, it’s a call, standin’ side by side,  
Diamond flame, baby—we’re taking this ride.

**Verse 2**  
Sirens bounce off the boarded windows—  
Dreams cook slow on radiator glows.  
Bruised but unbroken, we walk in the dust,  
Scars on our knuckles, hearts learning to trust.

Midnight’s a forge and the sparks all know—  
Diamonds are only born under pressure and glow.  
We’re the third-shift ghosts, the ones you forgot,  
Heating up the night, giving everything we’ve got.

**Pre-Chorus**  
We’ve got the hunger, we’ve got the right,  
Turning cold to gold, setting wrongs to right.  
Rise up together—let the fear combust,  
We won’t be silent,  
We won’t rust.

**Chorus**  
This is the revolution, feel the fire in the air,  
We’re taking back what’s ours—no more chains, no despair.  
It’s a movement, it’s a call, standin’ side by side,  
Diamond flame, baby—we’re taking this ride.

**\[Half-Time Breakdown / Bridge\]**  
*(Everything drops out except a cracked vocal, echo of a lighter flick)*  
Left my doubts in the broken glass,  
Streetlight shadows, letting old selves pass.  
Breathe in the heat, let the silence speak—  
Even diamonds have to break to gleam.

*(Band kicks back in—bigger, dirtier, triumphant)*  
Let it burn, let it grind,  
Let the world hear the sound when diamonds collide.  
We’re the flame, we’re the proof—  
Pressure makes us shine, and we’re living the truth.

**Final Chorus (All-In, Crowd Shouting)**  
This is the revolution, feel the fire in the air,  
We’re taking back what’s ours—no more chains, no despair.  
It’s a movement, it’s a call, standin’ side by side,

Another that I found recently is the Instant Coffee. I don't normally bother with the food that requires the stove because of the inventory space of the stove itself, however Instant Coffee gives 2 energy, cures hungry, has 6 uses per inventory slot, and doesn't go cold so you don't need the thermos. The only downside is that although it cures hungry it doesn't count for 'Ultimate Gourmet' when used out of the glove box.

1qytvw5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qytvw5,How to win over a cats heart?,"Hi! 

A few weeks ago my boyfriend and I adopted two cats fom spain. A male and a female (first picture is the male, the others are the female).

In the beginning she was the braver one, she used to come out if her hiding spot and watched us from a chair.

  
Then she was ill for a few days and we had to take her to the vet, which was easier than I thought, because she hopped into her box herself. It was nothing big, just fever, they gave her something and everything was fine again the next day.

Last week she came out and watched me, she even let me pet her head that night, but since then it's gotten so much worse.

She is hiding all day and even at night as long as she thinks that we're awake. Since we noticed that she only comes out to eat if we show her the food bowl before putting it on the floor, we did that now for the last two weeks and it worked pretty well. If she doesn't come out for a few hours after we brought them the food, her brother just eats ist, because its still standing there (he doesnt like food waste i guess).

Yesterday my boyfriend wanted to show her the bowl as usual and she got scared and jumped out of her hiding spot to hide behind the refrigerator (she ran across the whole apartement). She came out eventually and went back to her spot. When we went to bed I wanted to take the cat fishing rod and put it away (her brother would strangle himself with it if I would'nt put it away) and she saw me move a little bit towards her (i was still like 3m away from her) and she jumped out again, panicked and hid under the table.

The last few days she was always panicking, hiding between the coffee table and the couch and was shaking if someone came into the room. It gets worse everyday.

When we are home, we sit in the living room with them, talk to them and play with her brother. He is such a sweety, he likes to play, follows us through the whole apartement and sits with us. But we're not allowed to pet him.

  
I really need advice, I don't know, what we should do about her. We like her really really much and we are so sorry for her, but I feel like I cannot move in my own apartement or else I would scare her. When she is not running away, she's always hissing at us, if we dare to look at her for a second from across the room. She doesn't even take treats from us, not even if we lay them somewhere and go away.

They are both from a shelter in spain (we are from germany) and all we know is that they are like 1,5 years old and that they were in the shelter for about a year before we adopted them. Their previous owners abandoned them in their boxes with all toys, toilets and stuff.

We got along really well and we’d end up together quite a lot during the coffee breaks (she approached me majority of the time).

I really like it. It’s exactly what I’m looking for. I’m going back to school soon, it’s $18 an hour plus tips. The attire is very professional. It’s a fine dining restaurant. my hours are good. It’s pretty easy, feels like something very laid back.

Expect, my coworkers are just awful. They’re all girls in the 20s, expect for one 46 year women who I’ve befriended. They’re not friendly, they don’t talk to me. They’re not trying at all to be welcoming or kind. The only person who has given me any type of training is the 46 year old woman. The rest of the girls aren’t explaining anything to me, and when I attempt to do something, they get mad at me. 

I’ve been a manger and trainer for the past five years, and this behavior is wildly inappropriate. I talked to a manager and said the way the other girls are behaving is immature and being mean for the sake of being mean. And his response was “do you think you still want to stay here”

And I was flabbergasted. Of course I want to stay here, but you need to train these girls to be kinder and work together.

I can tell there’s a lot of animosity amongst the women. I’ve worked in coffee for five years and never encountered this. Everyone is best friends and we love working together.

On top of that, I now have servers complaining about my inexperience, because I went to a manager when a guest expressed being frustrated with her service. I had no idea who the service was, I just knew when something like that happens to get a manager.

I’ve been here three days. 

And I can sense hosts are not liked and kind of treated poorly. Being mistreated for reasons outside of my control, is a huge trigger for me.

We’ve been friends for around 10 years and are regularly in touch.

The past 6 months before she moved here, we talked a lot about how much we would hang out once she moved here, e.g., grab dinner or have a beer during weekdays, go out for drinks, coffee walks in the weekends etc.

Now she has been here for 5 weeks, and we have met once (very quickly). I have asked her many times just if she wants to hang out (nothing big, like a coffee, dinner or so) but she always says no and says she is busy. But I know she does not hang out with any other friends during the weeks except for perhaps 1 or 2 after works with co-workers per month.

I understand people can be busy, and in general, I’d say I’m very understanding that life comes in the way. But at this point, it feels like she just comes with excuses and does not prioritize me.

The other day she asked if we could schedule a coffee in 8 days and I don’t feel for it. Although I know her intentions are good and she feels she has to ”book me in”, I kind of don’t like booking in such small things when we live nearby. In addition, I don’t like the feeling of someone ”booking me” for 1 week in advance, almost like I’m on some checklist they need to get rid of haha (I know I may overreact but I really prefer keeping my schedule free unless bigger things like dinners, events etc.)

I said to her she can reach out when she is less busy instead. But honestly, at this point I feel a little bit annoyed by the whole situation and almost don’t feel for hanging out anymore…I just need a break.

Is it reasonable for me to react like this? Like I need a break? I don’t feel like pushing a relationship when we seem to have quite different ways in how to prioritize each other. And also, right now I’m still annoyed hehe",1,1770509182.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

1qytkcv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qytkcv,The Complete Claude Cowork Playbook - Cowork is your tireless AI assistant that gets 3 hour tasks done in 3 minutes.  Here are 20 great Cowork prompts and use cases,"

**TLDR:** Check out the attached presentation!  
  
Claude Cowork is like having a tireless assistant that lives in your computer. Here are 20 prompts that automate the tedious work you hate: organizing files, building reports, research, content creation, and decision-making. Most people use it wrong. These prompts + the pro tips at the end will 10x your output. No fluff, just what actually works.

**What is Claude Cowork and How Do You Actually Use It?**

Claude Cowork is a desktop application that lets Claude AI interact with your files, folders, and documents directly on your computer. Think of it as giving Claude hands to actually do work, not just give advice.

**What makes it different:**

* It can read, organize, and modify your actual files
* It works across your entire file system (desktop, documents, downloads, project folders)
* It can create new files, move things around, and build complete deliverables
* No coding required (this is built for non-developers)

**Who it's for:** Anyone drowning in digital chaos. Freelancers, marketers, researchers, project managers, small business owners, consultants. If you have files to organize and tasks to automate, this is for you.

**How to get access:**

1. Cowork is currently in available to download from Anthropic
2. Visit the Anthropic website or [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) to check current availability
3. Once you have access, download the desktop application
4. Connect it to your Claude account and grant it file system permissions

**First-time setup (5 minutes):**

* Install the desktop app
* Choose which folders Cowork can access (start with a test folder if you're cautious)
* Run a simple prompt like: Organize the files in my Downloads folder by type
* Watch it work. You'll immediately understand what's possible.

**The learning curve:** If you can write a clear sentence, you can use Cowork. That's it. No technical knowledge needed. The prompts below will show you exactly what to say.

Now let's get into the prompts that will change how you work.

**20 Great Claude Cowork prompts and use cases**

**1. The Desktop Detox**

**What it does:** Organizes your chaotic desktop into a clean folder structure.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze all files on my desktop. Create a logical folder structure by project, file type, and date. Move everything into the appropriate folders. Delete obvious duplicates and temporary files. Give me a summary of what you organized and what you deleted.`

**Why it works:** Before this took me 3 hours of dragging and dropping. Now it's done in 3 minutes while I get coffee.

**Pro move:** Run this every Friday. Your Monday self will thank you.

**2. The Receipt Destroyer**

**What it does:** Converts receipt photos/PDFs into formatted expense reports.

The prompt:  
  
`I have 23 receipt files in this folder. Extract all information (date, merchant, amount, category) and create an expense report spreadsheet. Calculate totals by category. Flag anything over $100 for review.`

**Why it works:** No more manual entry. No more forgotten receipts. Just drag, prompt, done.

**Pro move:** Take photos of receipts immediately. Create a Receipts folder. Run this monthly.

**3. The Keyword Gold Mine**

**What it does:** Performs keyword research without expensive tools.

The prompt:  
`Research keyword opportunities for [your topic]. Find: search volume patterns, related long-tail keywords, questions people ask, content gaps competitors miss, and seasonal trends. Organize by difficulty and opportunity score.`

**Why it works:** It scrapes, analyzes, and synthesizes in one go. I've tested it against Ahrefs. The insights are shockingly similar.

**Pro move:** Ask it to create a content calendar based on the keyword research. Two tasks, one prompt.

**4. The Positioning Knife**

**What it does:** Defines your market positioning with brutal clarity.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze my business/project materials in this folder. Define my market positioning: who I serve, what makes me different, why people choose me over alternatives, and what I'm NOT. Be specific. Challenge vague statements.`

**Why it works:** I spent 5 strategy calls trying to figure this out. This prompt gave me clarity in 10 minutes by analyzing my actual work, not my aspirations.

**Secret:** It sees patterns you're too close to notice. The what I'm NOT section is gold.

**5. The Audience X-Ray**

**What it does:** Maps your complete audience profile.

The prompt:  
  
`Based on my content, customer data, and market materials, create a detailed audience map: demographics, psychographics, where they spend time online, what they care about, what keeps them up at night, and what language they use. Include specific examples.`

**Why it works:** Turns fuzzy assumptions into concrete profiles. You'll recognize your exact customer.

**Pro move:** Save this as a document. Reference it before creating anything.

**6. The Research Brief Machine**

**What it does:** Creates client-ready research briefs from messy notes.

The prompt:  
  
`Turn my research notes and reference materials into a professional research brief. Include: executive summary, methodology, key findings, supporting data, implications, and recommendations. Format it for client presentation.`

**Why it works:** The structure is always there. You just need the raw material.

**Pro move:** Feed it transcripts from interviews. It'll pull out insights you missed.

**7. The Subscription Auditor**

**What it does:** Finds subscriptions you forgot you're paying for.

The prompt:  
  
`Scan my documents, emails, and downloads folder for subscription confirmations and recurring charges. Create a list with service name, cost, billing frequency, last use date (if available), and your recommendation to keep or cancel. Total the monthly and annual costs.`

**Why it works:** Found $127/month I was wasting on tools I used once in 2022.

**Brutal truth:** You're probably wasting $50-200/month right now.

**8. The Deep Dive Researcher**

**What it does:** Conducts comprehensive research on any topic.

The prompt:  
  
`Deep research [topic]. I need: current state of the field, key players and their positions, recent developments, conflicting viewpoints, data and statistics, expert opinions, and what's being missed in mainstream coverage. Cite all sources.`

**Why it works:** It's like having a research assistant who reads 47 articles and synthesizes the insights. In 10 minutes.

**Pro move:** Follow up with: Now write this as a brief for someone who knows nothing about this topic.

**9. The Slide Deck Generator**

**What it does:** Builds complete slide decks from rough outlines.

The prompt:  
  
`Create a slide deck on [topic] using Gamma. I need 12-15 slides covering [key points]. Make it professional, data-driven, and visually interesting. Include an opening hook and strong close. Tone: [your tone].`

**Why it works:** From rough idea to polished deck in one go. The Gamma integration is magic.

**Secret:** Give it an example of a slide deck you love. It'll match the vibe.

**10. The Spreadsheet Surgeon**

**What it does:** Fixes broken spreadsheets without touching formulas.

The prompt:  
  
`My spreadsheet has errors and broken formulas. Analyze what's wrong, fix the issues, and explain what was broken and how you fixed it. Preserve all data and working formulas.`

**Why it works:** No more formula panic. No more begging someone who understands Excel.

**Pro move:** Ask it to add documentation sheets explaining how the spreadsheet works. Future you will be grateful.

**11. The Reading List Prioritizer**

**What it does:** Organizes your 47 open tabs and saved articles.

The prompt:  
  
`I have 47 articles/tabs saved. Analyze them and create a prioritized reading list based on: relevance to my current projects, time sensitivity, unique insights, and learning value. Group by theme. Estimate reading time. Flag the top 5 must-reads.`

**Why it works:** Stops you from drowning in information. Focuses your learning.

**Truth bomb:** You won't read them all. This tells you which ones matter.

**12. The Brutal Reviewer**

**What it does:** Gives honest feedback nobody wants to give you.

The prompt:  
  
`Give me brutal, honest peer review on this work. What works, what doesn't, where I'm being vague, where I'm wrong, what I'm avoiding, and what needs to be cut entirely. Don't be nice. Be useful.`

**Why it works:** Friends sugarcoat. Colleagues avoid honesty. Claude tells the truth.

**Warning:** Only use this when you actually want honest feedback. Your ego might hurt.

**13. The Photo Organizer**

**What it does:** Sorts thousands of photos into logical albums.

The prompt:  
  
`Organize all photos in this folder by date, event, and people (when identifiable). Create album folders with descriptive names. Flag duplicates and blurry photos for potential deletion. Give me a summary of what you created.`

**Why it works:** No more camera roll chaos. No more scrolling for 10 minutes to find that one photo.

**Pro move:** Do this quarterly. It's impossible to do it all at once after 3 years of neglect.

**14. The Meeting Prep Master**

**What it does:** Turns scattered notes into structured agendas.

The prompt:  
  
`I have scattered notes about an upcoming meeting. Create a professional meeting agenda with: objectives, topics to cover, time allocations, pre-reads needed, decisions to be made, and follow-up items. Include suggested talking points for each section.`

**Why it works:** Transforms vague meeting into focused session. Everyone actually prepares.

**Secret:** Send this agenda 24 hours before. Meeting quality 10x's.

**15. The Email Pattern Analyzer**

**What it does:** Finds where you're wasting time in email.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze my email patterns (sample provided). Identify: which senders take most of my time, what types of emails I respond to fastest vs slowest, recurring topics that could be templated, and meetings that could be emails. Give recommendations to cut email time by 30%.`

**Why it works:** You can't improve what you don't measure. This measures everything.

**Harsh reality:** 40% of your emails probably don't need your personal response.

**16. The Content Calendar Builder**

**What it does:** Creates a content calendar from random ideas.

The prompt:  
  
`I have these content ideas (rough list). Create a 90-day content calendar with: publication dates, titles, topics, target keywords, content type, estimated effort, and strategic rationale. Balance evergreen and timely content. Flag dependencies.`

**Why it works:** Turns ideas into strategy. No more what should I post today panic.

**Pro move:** Ask it to create content briefs for each piece. Now you have a content system.

**17. The Project File Architect**

**What it does:** Structures project files the right way from the start.

The prompt:  
  
`Create a proper file structure for [project type]. Include folders for: working files, finals, references, assets, admin/contracts, and archive. Create README files explaining each folder. Set up naming conventions. Make it scalable for a team.`

**Why it works:** No more files named final\_v2\_REAL\_final\_THIS\_ONE.pdf. Professional structure from day one.

**Truth:** Spend 5 minutes on structure. Save 5 hours of searching later.

**18. The Template Factory**

**What it does:** Creates templates for recurring tasks.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze these [reports/documents/processes] I do repeatedly. Create reusable templates with: standard structure, placeholder text, formatting, and instructions for using the template. Make it idiot-proof for future me.`

**Why it works:** Do the thinking once. Apply it forever.

**Pro move:** Create a Templates folder. Reference it religiously.

**19. The Smart File Renamer**

**What it does:** Batch renames files with intelligent naming.

The prompt:  
  
`Rename all files in this folder using a consistent convention: [Date]_[Project]_[Type]_[Version]. Extract relevant information from file content/metadata when needed. Preserve file types. Give me a before/after list.`

**Why it works:** Searchable files. Sortable files. No more IMG\_4582.jpg.

**Secret:** This seems minor until you need to find something fast. Then it's everything.

**20. The Documentation Generator**

**What it does:** Creates documentation from existing project files.

The prompt:  
  
`Generate comprehensive documentation for this project based on all files in the folder. Include: project overview, file structure, how to use/modify, dependencies, known issues, and future considerations. Write it for someone joining the project fresh.`

**Why it works:** Documentation is always outdated or nonexistent. This creates it from ground truth.

**Brutal truth:** If you can't explain it, you don't understand it. This forces clarity.

**The Pro Tips Most People Miss**

**1. Chain Prompts Together** Don't do one thing at a time. Ask Cowork to organize your files AND create a project summary AND build a timeline. It'll do all three.

**2. Create a Prompts Library** Save your best prompts in your prompt library - check out [PromptMagic.dev](http://PromptMagic.dev) to create your free prompt library. Don't lose your best prompts and reinvent the wheel every time.

**3. Be Specific About Output Format** Want a spreadsheet? Say spreadsheet. Want markdown? Say markdown. Want a PDF report? Say it. Specificity = better results.

**4. Give Examples** Show Cowork what good looks like. Upload an example of the format you want. It'll match it.

**5. Use the Follow-Up** First prompt gets you 80% there. Follow-up prompt gets you to 95%. Most people stop at 80%.

**6. Automate the Automation** Create a checklist of prompts you run weekly. Friday afternoon = cleanup time. Stick to it.

**7. Start Small** Don't try to reorganize your entire digital life in one go. Pick one prompt. Master it. Add another.

**8. Think in Systems** These prompts aren't one-offs. They're building blocks. Combine them. Create workflows. That's where the magic is.

# The Secrets Nobody Talks About

**The speed advantage is real.** Tasks that took hours now take minutes. That's not hype. That's my actual experience across 6 months.

**It makes you think differently.** Once you know you can automate something, you start seeing automation opportunities everywhere.

**The quality is higher than you expect.** I thought AI-generated work would be sloppy. It's often more thorough than what I'd do manually because I get lazy.

**It fails gracefully.** When it can't do something perfectly, it tells you what it tried and why it's stuck. That's more useful than silent failure.

**The learning curve is backwards.** Most tools get harder as you use advanced features. This gets easier because you learn what it's capable of.

**You'll stop doing busy work.** Once you taste what's possible, you can't go back to manual file organization. Your brain is too valuable for that.

growing up, it was my 90's little sister experience never to actually play video games, but to watch them being played so 'let's plays' and video game run-throughs on youtube are nostalgic for me.  i saw there was a new 'silent hill' video game and it's not something i watch intently, the indulgent part is that i drowsed the entire time 'watching' this and held myself as if i were with someone for comfort (sure is lonesome at the top).  i had a slice of [carrot bread](https://imgur.com/r0s3NGc) and later on took a bath.

the evening [dog walk](https://imgur.com/6GQxyJ5) was short and one of those nights where molly gets really happy to be on the road.  it's some combination of the snow being packed just right, and the temperature being around - 20 that just makes her all frisky as we're getting close to home.  she bites me and jumps around and spins in circles.

1qythzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1qythzk/this_is_why_your_meds_arent_working_i_think_i/,THIS is why your MEDS aren't working. I think I have finally figured it all out!! ;),"So most of us go through this, all of a sudden it feels like your meds aren't working or like you didn't take them at all. There are many reasons why your medication may not be working as effectively as it should, I have been researching this for a long time so here they are....

(Please remember I am not a doctor, this is my opinion through experiences and conversations with people and doctors.)

1. You are not eating well (balanced diet, low sugar, low acid) and drinking enough. Little snacks are not enough, you need proteins and healthy fats, potatoes and veggies. Have at least 1 good meal a day.  

2. You are not getting fresh air and exercise. Sunshine and movement are so important for our overall health and nervous system regulation. A doc told me massagers are great too, use on your back and legs, arms, etc. to stimulate and ""re-set"" the nervous system. Helps me a ton.

3. You are not learning and growing, self-reflecting, practicing mindfulness, expanding your mindset and understanding your condition, and how your mind works. 

4. You are drinking coffee!!! This one shocked me. So of course we know the caffeine can trigger side effects like heart palpitations and anxiety, but its the acid that affects the Vyvanse and how it leaves the body. If you have acidic urine, it leaves quickly, they say within 4 hours. If you have low acid then it can last 12-18 hours. Take Tums on those days you need it to last long and be fully effective, it works big time! Don't do this daily though and try to change your diet to low acid, but talk to your doc first. 

5. You are going through hormonal changes...puberty, started the pill, peri-menopause (which is being studied in women with adhd as its being said that we typically have symptoms 10 years earlier than ""typical"" women. Bah humbug!) If you have PMS/in your cycle it wont be as effective and for many it makes their symptoms worse. It's a good time for a med break, doctors have told me during this time to avoid tolerance issues. 

6. You may not have ADHD. Maybe you have been misdiagnosed and/or have other conditions like Anxiety, OCD, depression and also Autism is also very common in people with ADHD. Get tested by a licensed professional like a psychiatrist. It takes hours/days for a proper assessment. 

7. The medication is not for you. Try a non-stimulant or one of the generic versions (there are around 20). I take TEVA and have for years. You could also try a different adhd medication all together. Write down what you need help with and the doctor can accurately guide you to the right med.

8. Your dose is too high/too low.

9. You are storing it in a place that is too hot, like above your stove. Should be kept at room temp, 68-77 degrees (20 to 25) It degrades in heat and will not work at all. 

10. You have been on it for too long and developed a tolerance. Take a week or two off and start on a lower dose. 

11. You are taking other medications that interfere with the effectiveness of Vyvanse:

* [**MAO Inhibitors**](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&hs=lKJp&sca_esv=9447ce1ae06b4598&rls=en&sxsrf=ANbL-n7YvJvpt7PRJLOMLpi6_QgCJhIMrQ%3A1770508294504&q=MAO+Inhibitors&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi05dyvyciSAxWilokEHdvKMREQxccNegQIFBAB&mstk=AUtExfD1daRLNw-ukDqLXb4UXVs5gjdIyjCt2xrDU_zx1jYdUWRAEfqPR3rn_Wzwv0Mu4xi2tuMz50TJhE0iK5ejhPmuj8rnjAhR5xOWnm4Df3rnaqc62eCptZ07IM1qgiwHpL4&csui=3) **(MAOIs)**:  A dangerous interaction can occur, leading to dangerously high blood pressure; never combine within 14 days.
* **Other Stimulants**:  Combining with other ADHD stimulants or even caffeine (in large amounts) increases risk of high blood pressure, insomnia, anxiety, and heart problems.
* **Serotonergic Drugs**:  Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs) and migraine drugs (triptans) can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a serious condition.
* **Alcohol**:  Can worsen central nervous system side effects like dizziness and impaired judgment.

12. You keep increasing your dose and don't take med breaks. You will develop a tolerance (most likely) without med breaks. 

That's all I've got for now, but I'm sure I will remember more as time goes by! Hope it helps someone, good luck to you all in your journeys! :))

A lot of women will smile and seem really friendly, but if you ask for their number or tell them you'll take them out for drinks or coffee etc, they get all flustered or taken aback seeming.

If I don't ask her, then I usually spend the rest of the day wondering what she actually  thought about me. It's not rejection I'm worried about, just somebody thinking I'm too creepy even though that's not my intention.

Do I need to pay more attention when I'm talking to women or are they just so subtle thinking that we'll pick up on their lingo? And on a side note, how do I not come across as creepy when I'm talking to women?",1,1770508434.0,dating,4,0.67,False

**1. The Desktop Detox**

**What it does:** Organizes your chaotic desktop into a clean folder structure.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze all files on my desktop. Create a logical folder structure by project, file type, and date. Move everything into the appropriate folders. Delete obvious duplicates and temporary files. Give me a summary of what you organized and what you deleted.`

**Why it works:** Before this took me 3 hours of dragging and dropping. Now it's done in 3 minutes while I get coffee.

**Pro move:** Run this every Friday. Your Monday self will thank you.

**2. The Receipt Destroyer**

**What it does:** Converts receipt photos/PDFs into formatted expense reports.

The prompt:  
  
`I have 23 receipt files in this folder. Extract all information (date, merchant, amount, category) and create an expense report spreadsheet. Calculate totals by category. Flag anything over $100 for review.`

**Why it works:** No more manual entry. No more forgotten receipts. Just drag, prompt, done.

**Pro move:** Take photos of receipts immediately. Create a Receipts folder. Run this monthly.

**3. The Keyword Gold Mine**

**What it does:** Performs keyword research without expensive tools.

The prompt:  
`Research keyword opportunities for [your topic]. Find: search volume patterns, related long-tail keywords, questions people ask, content gaps competitors miss, and seasonal trends. Organize by difficulty and opportunity score.`

**Why it works:** It scrapes, analyzes, and synthesizes in one go. I've tested it against Ahrefs. The insights are shockingly similar.

**Pro move:** Ask it to create a content calendar based on the keyword research. Two tasks, one prompt.

**4. The Positioning Knife**

**What it does:** Defines your market positioning with brutal clarity.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze my business/project materials in this folder. Define my market positioning: who I serve, what makes me different, why people choose me over alternatives, and what I'm NOT. Be specific. Challenge vague statements.`

**Why it works:** I spent 5 strategy calls trying to figure this out. This prompt gave me clarity in 10 minutes by analyzing my actual work, not my aspirations.

**Secret:** It sees patterns you're too close to notice. The what I'm NOT section is gold.

**5. The Audience X-Ray**

**What it does:** Maps your complete audience profile.

The prompt:  
  
`Based on my content, customer data, and market materials, create a detailed audience map: demographics, psychographics, where they spend time online, what they care about, what keeps them up at night, and what language they use. Include specific examples.`

**Why it works:** Turns fuzzy assumptions into concrete profiles. You'll recognize your exact customer.

**Pro move:** Save this as a document. Reference it before creating anything.

**6. The Research Brief Machine**

**What it does:** Creates client-ready research briefs from messy notes.

The prompt:  
  
`Turn my research notes and reference materials into a professional research brief. Include: executive summary, methodology, key findings, supporting data, implications, and recommendations. Format it for client presentation.`

**Why it works:** The structure is always there. You just need the raw material.

**Pro move:** Feed it transcripts from interviews. It'll pull out insights you missed.

**7. The Subscription Auditor**

**What it does:** Finds subscriptions you forgot you're paying for.

The prompt:  
  
`Scan my documents, emails, and downloads folder for subscription confirmations and recurring charges. Create a list with service name, cost, billing frequency, last use date (if available), and your recommendation to keep or cancel. Total the monthly and annual costs.`

**Why it works:** Found $127/month I was wasting on tools I used once in 2022.

**Brutal truth:** You're probably wasting $50-200/month right now.

**8. The Deep Dive Researcher**

**What it does:** Conducts comprehensive research on any topic.

The prompt:  
  
`Deep research [topic]. I need: current state of the field, key players and their positions, recent developments, conflicting viewpoints, data and statistics, expert opinions, and what's being missed in mainstream coverage. Cite all sources.`

**Why it works:** It's like having a research assistant who reads 47 articles and synthesizes the insights. In 10 minutes.

**Pro move:** Follow up with: Now write this as a brief for someone who knows nothing about this topic.

**9. The Slide Deck Generator**

**What it does:** Builds complete slide decks from rough outlines.

The prompt:  
  
`Create a slide deck on [topic] using Gamma. I need 12-15 slides covering [key points]. Make it professional, data-driven, and visually interesting. Include an opening hook and strong close. Tone: [your tone].`

**Why it works:** From rough idea to polished deck in one go. The Gamma integration is magic.

**Secret:** Give it an example of a slide deck you love. It'll match the vibe.

**10. The Spreadsheet Surgeon**

**What it does:** Fixes broken spreadsheets without touching formulas.

The prompt:  
  
`My spreadsheet has errors and broken formulas. Analyze what's wrong, fix the issues, and explain what was broken and how you fixed it. Preserve all data and working formulas.`

**Why it works:** No more formula panic. No more begging someone who understands Excel.

**Pro move:** Ask it to add documentation sheets explaining how the spreadsheet works. Future you will be grateful.

**11. The Reading List Prioritizer**

**What it does:** Organizes your 47 open tabs and saved articles.

The prompt:  
  
`I have 47 articles/tabs saved. Analyze them and create a prioritized reading list based on: relevance to my current projects, time sensitivity, unique insights, and learning value. Group by theme. Estimate reading time. Flag the top 5 must-reads.`

**Why it works:** Stops you from drowning in information. Focuses your learning.

**Truth bomb:** You won't read them all. This tells you which ones matter.

**12. The Brutal Reviewer**

**What it does:** Gives honest feedback nobody wants to give you.

The prompt:  
  
`Give me brutal, honest peer review on this work. What works, what doesn't, where I'm being vague, where I'm wrong, what I'm avoiding, and what needs to be cut entirely. Don't be nice. Be useful.`

**Why it works:** Friends sugarcoat. Colleagues avoid honesty. Claude tells the truth.

**Warning:** Only use this when you actually want honest feedback. Your ego might hurt.

**13. The Photo Organizer**

**What it does:** Sorts thousands of photos into logical albums.

The prompt:  
  
`Organize all photos in this folder by date, event, and people (when identifiable). Create album folders with descriptive names. Flag duplicates and blurry photos for potential deletion. Give me a summary of what you created.`

**Why it works:** No more camera roll chaos. No more scrolling for 10 minutes to find that one photo.

**Pro move:** Do this quarterly. It's impossible to do it all at once after 3 years of neglect.

**14. The Meeting Prep Master**

**What it does:** Turns scattered notes into structured agendas.

The prompt:  
  
`I have scattered notes about an upcoming meeting. Create a professional meeting agenda with: objectives, topics to cover, time allocations, pre-reads needed, decisions to be made, and follow-up items. Include suggested talking points for each section.`

**Why it works:** Transforms vague meeting into focused session. Everyone actually prepares.

**Secret:** Send this agenda 24 hours before. Meeting quality 10x's.

**15. The Email Pattern Analyzer**

**What it does:** Finds where you're wasting time in email.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze my email patterns (sample provided). Identify: which senders take most of my time, what types of emails I respond to fastest vs slowest, recurring topics that could be templated, and meetings that could be emails. Give recommendations to cut email time by 30%.`

**Why it works:** You can't improve what you don't measure. This measures everything.

**Harsh reality:** 40% of your emails probably don't need your personal response.

**16. The Content Calendar Builder**

**What it does:** Creates a content calendar from random ideas.

The prompt:  
  
`I have these content ideas (rough list). Create a 90-day content calendar with: publication dates, titles, topics, target keywords, content type, estimated effort, and strategic rationale. Balance evergreen and timely content. Flag dependencies.`

**Why it works:** Turns ideas into strategy. No more what should I post today panic.

**Pro move:** Ask it to create content briefs for each piece. Now you have a content system.

**17. The Project File Architect**

**What it does:** Structures project files the right way from the start.

The prompt:  
  
`Create a proper file structure for [project type]. Include folders for: working files, finals, references, assets, admin/contracts, and archive. Create README files explaining each folder. Set up naming conventions. Make it scalable for a team.`

**Why it works:** No more files named final\_v2\_REAL\_final\_THIS\_ONE.pdf. Professional structure from day one.

**Truth:** Spend 5 minutes on structure. Save 5 hours of searching later.

**18. The Template Factory**

**What it does:** Creates templates for recurring tasks.

The prompt:  
  
`Analyze these [reports/documents/processes] I do repeatedly. Create reusable templates with: standard structure, placeholder text, formatting, and instructions for using the template. Make it idiot-proof for future me.`

**Why it works:** Do the thinking once. Apply it forever.

**Pro move:** Create a Templates folder. Reference it religiously.

**19. The Smart File Renamer**

**What it does:** Batch renames files with intelligent naming.

The prompt:  
  
`Rename all files in this folder using a consistent convention: [Date]_[Project]_[Type]_[Version]. Extract relevant information from file content/metadata when needed. Preserve file types. Give me a before/after list.`

**Why it works:** Searchable files. Sortable files. No more IMG\_4582.jpg.

**Secret:** This seems minor until you need to find something fast. Then it's everything.

**20. The Documentation Generator**

**What it does:** Creates documentation from existing project files.

The prompt:  
  
`Generate comprehensive documentation for this project based on all files in the folder. Include: project overview, file structure, how to use/modify, dependencies, known issues, and future considerations. Write it for someone joining the project fresh.`

**Why it works:** Documentation is always outdated or nonexistent. This creates it from ground truth.

**Brutal truth:** If you can't explain it, you don't understand it. This forces clarity.

**The Pro Tips Most People Miss**

**1. Chain Prompts Together** Don't do one thing at a time. Ask Cowork to organize your files AND create a project summary AND build a timeline. It'll do all three.

**2. Create a Prompts Library** Save your best prompts in your prompt library - check out [PromptMagic.dev](http://PromptMagic.dev) to create your free prompt library. Don't lose your best prompts and reinvent the wheel every time.

**3. Be Specific About Output Format** Want a spreadsheet? Say spreadsheet. Want markdown? Say markdown. Want a PDF report? Say it. Specificity = better results.

**4. Give Examples** Show Cowork what good looks like. Upload an example of the format you want. It'll match it.

**5. Use the Follow-Up** First prompt gets you 80% there. Follow-up prompt gets you to 95%. Most people stop at 80%.

**6. Automate the Automation** Create a checklist of prompts you run weekly. Friday afternoon = cleanup time. Stick to it.

**7. Start Small** Don't try to reorganize your entire digital life in one go. Pick one prompt. Master it. Add another.

**8. Think in Systems** These prompts aren't one-offs. They're building blocks. Combine them. Create workflows. That's where the magic is.

# The Secrets Nobody Talks About

**The speed advantage is real.** Tasks that took hours now take minutes. That's not hype. That's my actual experience across 6 months.

**It makes you think differently.** Once you know you can automate something, you start seeing automation opportunities everywhere.

**The quality is higher than you expect.** I thought AI-generated work would be sloppy. It's often more thorough than what I'd do manually because I get lazy.

**It fails gracefully.** When it can't do something perfectly, it tells you what it tried and why it's stuck. That's more useful than silent failure.

**The learning curve is backwards.** Most tools get harder as you use advanced features. This gets easier because you learn what it's capable of.

**You'll stop doing busy work.** Once you taste what's possible, you can't go back to manual file organization. Your brain is too valuable for that.

1qytfip,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrisbaneSocial/comments/1qytfip/35m_looking_for_friendssunday_chill_motorbike/,35M looking for friends/Sunday chill motorbike ride. Southside.,"Hi guys/girls. My turn to look for friends.

Was looking to either join a chill motorbike group that go out for a ride on a Sunday morning, then coffee & chat.

Or find some individuals on here that would be keen to band together and make our own group.

I have a 2025 KTM Duke 390, so not looking to flog it down the road doing 150km or stunts, just a nice chill ride out to somewhere, stop for coffee, then head back.

Even fine if you're on your L's or new to riding.
