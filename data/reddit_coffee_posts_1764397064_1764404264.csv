1p9jjq7,https://i.redd.it/epwn2kmhm54g1.png,Let's talk about Under the Greenlight...,"*I go first...long post ahead*

I may be late for the hype of this manhwa, but I surely wanna share my thoughts about it.

The encounter of Jin and Matthew in first chapter is somehow funny to me. How can you comeback to a Cafe when you said back then that the coffee tastes awful, and now you're saying to the owner that their coffee is good that you came back (of course it's double-meaning, Jin wants that cookie—Matthew— so bad). The early chapters can get you hooked-up on the story because of the enticing characters (especially when Matthew, the expressionless guy, gets so flustered and blushing all the time) and how the story's unfolding. I'm gonna state here the scenes that really caught me so good that Jin and Matthew grew on me 🫶.

- Their first Friday night, it's their first hooking up and I really like the way how it ends. How did Jin, a guy so full of himself begs first to end their session for that night because Matthew is unstoppable—well it's his first time. That's a blow to Jin's pride, and for me, it's like Matthew outdo the doer. ""Who says u can't outdo the doer?""

- Everytime Matthew having this anxiety thoughts, he wants Jin so bad that I can feel it over the screen. When he's jealous but can't seem to say it because Jin is not even his. He totally look like a lost puppy every damn time when Jin's around, willing to give him everything. ""What a yearner you are, Matt!""

- When all of a sudden, Jin's speech bubbles became fancy and the background's flowery after dressing up Matthew. It's so funny how he elaborates Matthew's perfection nonchalantly and realizes it after. ""Go get that cookie, Jin!""

- The time I read the finale of S1, the roller coaster of emotions I had because of it. The realization, the emotions, the situation, and THEIR FEELINGS! All of them presented onto that chapter perfectly that I wish I'll have the guts to proceed with the S2. I'm hesitant for a while because I really don't have the slightest idea what would be the start of S2. I'm just holding to the fact that UTG is happy ending. ""Well, you've come this far. *pats myself*""

- It's the chapter where you'll think Matt is giving up on staying, but Jin wants otherwise. Jin making Matt stay beside him for good. It's so lovely to witness that scene, they really look so unsightly vulnerable physically and mentally yet their exchange of words are so enticing to see. Matt has been dreaming about the moment where Jin and him are finally together. So, it's a plus for Matt. ""Go get ur man, Matt!""

- When the action part happened, where Jin and Matthew against that mf Brandon. I'm literally shouting, ""Kill that mf now!"" My impatience cannot wait for him to die asap. I don't want any trip down memory lane any more, because all I see how Jin's suffered. ""Got my hopes up for nothing tho, he's still alive!""

- Jin, he's a pretty but not so perfect guy for me (just like how Matt see him). His punch may be hurts, but his words could figuratively burns. He said that Matt is more dependable, but for me he's the best at that field. Matt on the other hand, he's a big obsessed yearner. But, what can we do about it? He's been waiting all his life for Jin and that's the reason why's he still keeps going. Jin and Matthew, they are their own safe place. ""They were too young to struggle just to live, so love you both babies.""

I just love how this story talks about Trust, it's not just a word that easily you can spit out of your mouth, it's how you show that you're capable and worth it of that word. That's how anyone can be a traitor because they're not capable enough and choosing the wrong path. After reading this story, I realized how really trust can broke easily but it's all up to you if you can give them a chance again or if they really worth of it at all. 

I shed tears to their moments at the later chapters. Everytime I encounter some worth to take notes on, I write it on here—everything—my emotions, my fav moments of them. Their story really did gave me more lesson about life, how it reflects a real life situation (not sure with mafia part tho). Well, that's one of hella roller coaster of emotions huh I ain't complaining tho. IT WAS SUCH A GOOD STORY! *Absolute Cinema Hands*

1p9jhs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/1p9jhs1/need_advise_post_breakup/,Need advise post breakup,"Hi all,  
I just need an small advise post breakup so before that I just wanted to give a small gist like what happened between us. Please bear with me.

So yeah, let’s go back to the end of February this year. I (24M) matched with this girl (24F) on a dating app and things were pretty good. We hit it off really quickly. We used to flirt and chat for hours without getting bored. After a few days of constant texting, we decided to meet.

The date went really well — we talked a lot over coffee, and we even walked hand in hand. If you asked me to describe it in one word, I would say *perfect*. She liked it too, and we continued talking. We then had two more dates, which went well too.

But yes, here comes the twist. I was seriously ill at that time, so for my treatment I had to regularly visit the hospital for the next two months, and I couldn’t go out or do much. That basically meant that after just three dates, we suddenly entered a long-distance talking stage. She hadn’t dated anyone before, so I actually asked her to leave me and find someone else since my treatment was going to take time. But she decided to stay — and she really stayed and waited for me.

This made me fall for her, and finally after two months of the talking stage, we started dating. I met her twice after my treatment was done, but then again I had to leave town and we were hit with long distance again. Things were going pretty well, and after a month and a half, I went to meet her. We spent some good time together, but she admitted that she wasn’t as attracted to me anymore. She would zone out a lot. I honestly thought it was because of the distance, and I tried to convince her by telling her the same.

Anyway, after this, she had to leave town because of her job. So yeah, you guessed it — another round of long distance. But since I was getting better, I told her that no matter where she goes, I will come and visit her as often as possible. And keeping that promise, I planned my next visits and even booked a ticket for one of them.

One day, while I was telling her about my plans, the unexpected happened. Long story short, she wanted to break up with me because she didn’t feel attracted to me anymore. She had been thinking about it for a month but didn’t tell me. I was devastated. I tried a lot to make her stay, but she was adamant about breaking up. She said she still loved me, but didn’t want to continue. Also, we worked in completely unrelated fields and she wanted to date someone from her field.

Even though I tried hard, we eventually agreed to break up after one more month because I already had plans to visit her. Things were going normal until one day — about 10 days before I was supposed to meet her — I received the nightmare text: “WE NEED TO TALK.”

I already knew where this was going, and yes, the same thing happened. She didn’t want to meet me anymore because she liked someone else. To summarize, we had a big fight and we broke up.

I’m not saying I’m innocent. I’m also to blame. I had anger issues. I was a bit insecure — not much, but enough to cause problems. My insecurity came from feeling like I wasn’t good enough for her and that she could find anyone better. Most of our fights happened because of me. But when she left, she said that whatever she felt for me was just infatuation because she felt bad for my health. That hurt me a lot, but I still miss her so much.

**Question: It has been around 2 months since the breakup and 2 days back she unfollowed me on insta. I didn't see that coming. I was just thinking does she still misses me that's why she did that? Should I reach out to her again and try to make up things? For sure I will take accountability for my part. But yes the main Question is should I reach out or just let it go?**  
**Because I really miss her a lot.**

1p9jgqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1p9jgqo/is_it_normal_for_a_partner_to_expect_support_but/,Is it normal for a partner to expect support but never give any back?,"I (F) feel like my fiancé (M) and I are stuck in a really unhealthy pattern, and I’m starting to question whether this relationship is sustainable.

He keeps telling me I “don’t support him,” but the truth is, I don’t feel supported by him. When I tell him that, he says I never supported him, even though I do. I encourage him with school anytime he’s unsure, and I encourage him to study instead of playing games. I even made a board for him to track his classes and write one thing he accomplished each day. I literally stopped doing it because I don’t feel the same support, and no matter what I do, he keeps saying it’s not enough.

I wanted to work at Wendy’s again (I was a GM there before), and he’s been resistant. He says it’s “not good for us right now” or “too far,” even though it’s only 20 minutes away. He does have some lights on in the car, but one Wendy’s check will cover all the repairs, and I even offered my first check to go toward that. He said he’d take me to the interview, but only after days of convincing, with excuses each time. He also sends me marketing/social media jobs because he says I’d be good at them since I have a degree in it — but I don’t want to do those jobs. I want to run my lash business. One check from Wendy’s would literally cover all our bills, but he downplays that and insists I focus on something else, like a part-time job at a coffee shop that wouldn’t even allow me to cover the things I want and need for the house, plus things I want to buy for both of us. Right now, he’s covering the bills, and he even said that with the part-time job, it’d just be to cover my beauty stuff, which he’s never had to buy me.

He also says things like I’m “not living in reality,” calls me delusional, and brings up that I’m in a low place — not to comfort me, but as a way to criticize. I want kids really badly. If it were up to me, I’d have some already. That’s my dream — to be a stay-at-home mom. I had an abortion really young, so it’s such a touchy topic for me. Recently, I thought I was pregnant (my period ended early) and told him, “Let’s get a test.” He said, “You’ve thought you were pregnant so many times before in our relationship and you never were,” and that hurt me to my core. I even lost a little bit of faith in God when I got a negative test back because I prayed so hard and wanted it so badly. Today, I joked about having a baby, and he said no because I “don’t support him,” since he tried to tell me about school and I just shut him down for talking about it — because I just can’t really pour into him right now since I feel empty.

In the morning, before all of that happened, I asked him if we could go to the library, and he responded that he’s “locked in,” which I felt some kind of way about. It makes me feel dismissed, especially imagining how he might treat our future kids. No, I’m not a baby, but I’m a woman, and I feel like a man should always drop everything for his woman. He says I should “respect his boundaries,” but I’m his partner — shouldn’t I come first sometimes?

Regarding finances, he says he wants me to just get a part-time job close to home even though money is tight, and I have a literal opportunity to almost match what he’s being paid right now. He says he doesn’t care about money, but I can’t help feeling like he enjoys the control his current job and school give him. He even says if I work 50 hours a week, I can’t help him — yet he downplays how much I could actually contribute financially and makes so many logistic issues: first it was the car, then how far Wendy’s was, then working closing shifts. I made accommodations to all his requests and am willing to walk out of the interview if I can’t work at the store 20 minutes away mornings only. Even after I told him I’m drawing very straightforward boundaries when I have the interview, I still had to convince him to take me. Then he made me feel so bad I rescheduled the interview again because he says he’d take me, but it’s such a “ugh, I’ll take you if you want to go” kind of thing — like it’s such a burden or problem for him, making me not even want to do it.

When he’s on work calls and sounds stressed, I tell him he sounds great because it encourages him and helps him book appointments, whether he wants to admit it or not. He says that’s lying. I feel like he doesn’t understand what having a partner’s back really means — probably because he never had mine.

I love him, but I feel like everything I do is wrong and that he rewrites the relationship to make himself the victim. I want to run my business, contribute financially for my household, and be supported emotionally — is that unreasonable? Has anyone dealt with a partner who dismisses you like this while expecting constant support? It’s like he’s so avoidant and dismissive, and I didn’t grow up trapping my emotions. I’m especially worried because I feel like I’m picking up his habits, like ignoring him when he’s talking to me or pretending like I’m fine when I feel emotional. I don’t know if this is something we can work through, or if it’s a sign I need to step away",1,1764403549.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

My mistake! Now I live in a Stars Hollow-ish town and for early aughts nostalgia/autumnal reasons decided to watch the entire series for the very first time.

Right away it struck me that Amy Sherman-Palladino was ""smuggling ideas across borders."" To my surprise, despite the cozy facade the show is intriguingly weird and as I noticed actor appearances from David Lynch's beloved 1990 show ""Twin Peaks"" I started noticing more similarities. (For quick reference, Sherry (GG) also played Shelly (TP); Sasha and Anna (GG) also played Audrey (TP); Liz (GG) also played Gwen (TP); and, Jack (AYIT) also played Leland (TP). 

As I near the end of the show,  the similarities are just too numerous to ignore; a small town populated with lovable weirdos all fixated on a teenage girl from a severely dysfunctional family. The coffee, the baked goods, the 50s style diner...I mean, come on! I finally looked to see if ASP had ever commented on this and sure enough she did an interview in 2025 in which she and Daniel Palladino fully lay out how they were inspired by Twin Peaks:

[Polygon: ""Let’s just live here awhile"": The Palladinos on Gilmore Girls Twin Peaks References](https://www.polygon.com/tv/527942/twin-peaks-gilmore-girls-influence-connection-palladinos-interview/)

My favorite parts of the interview:

* Years ago, ASP bought a copy of ""The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer"" and then checked into a creepy hotel for a couple of days for the sole purpose of reading the book (a lady after my own heart!). 
* ASP was strongly influenced by David Lynch's use of music and also how he created a sense of ""place"" with Twin Peaks. The studio was more focused on the attractiveness of Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel and how they could hook audiences with their looks and banter, but ASP felt creating an interesting town people would want to visit was her ""secret weapon.""
* ASP liked casting actors who were on Twin Peaks because David Lynch had a good knack for spotting people who were a bit weird, so if they came from Twin Peaks they were pre-vetted for strangeness.
* Both ASP and DP knew they couldn't exactly copy Twin Peaks, but instead stuck to an ethos that felt very David Lynch; amplify the small moments and downplay the big events. Good life philosophy, too.

Fantastic interview aside, these also appear to be some of the generally agreed upon Twin Peaks/David Lynch nods in Gilmore Girls:

* Rory's New Yorker piece on the back of Luke's menu, ""wrapped in plastic"" is a reference to Laura Palmer on Twin Peaks being wrapped in plastic.
* From ""The Road Trip to Harvard"" episode: ""I'm not arguing in this room, it's too David Lynch!""
* ""A Film by Kirk"" could perhaps be described as...Lynchian.
* Loreli's dream in which the dog Paul Anka meets the real Paul Anka is surreal in a dreamlike way, yes, but this specifically feels like something out of Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive.

I'm usually great at regulating emotions and my thoughts. It's literally my job. But in this situation I really just don't know how to get out of this one. I keep falling straight back into this story again and again. Eyeroll. Rant incoming. Sorry. 

Here is the situation. My new boyfriend had a ""f\*\*\*buddy"" just before me. He always knew she wasn't gonna be his life partner. Just fun and convenience. They also worked together... at some point (kinda in the cross over) she developed feelings, so they decided they had to call it quits. (this is when he met me). I then left the country and we talked on the phone for the next 4ish months. Our feelings developed - all the while I was planning to go back. 

Side note: I have NO IDEA whether or not he slept with her again while I was gone. As far as he had ""told me"" - he hasn't... but the following makes me think maybe other wise. 

By the time I returned he and I were falling. We decided to be official real quick and I was living with him instantly. 

BUT. he was still working with this chick. As soon as I came she found out about me and that we were together. He didn't tell her until she found out. She was soo upset. Cried to him. She had such strong feelings. Jealous. And he was there to look after her. Console her. He then kept telling me how upset she was. He just told me ""Yeah she needs time to adjust"" and kept saying that they were really close friends. Me at the time thought. Okay yeah sure... but situations kept happening. On his birthday I thought (1 month since I had been back) I said we should invite her (his friend was organizing it).... ANYWAY I heard her say on the phone ""oh if she's there, I'm not coming"". Another time, she insisted not to see me ... that then my boyfriend dropped me off in a cafe close by, while he brought her something quick... BRUH TF. Now thats on him as well. 

They kept seeing each other for a coffee date maybe 1 a week or 1 ever 2 weeks, maybe for an hour... There is more but let's just not go into it. 

The main thing that I am struggling with is: 

1. how can he not recognize that she will never be a close friend, or shouldn't be because they slept together. - he keeepsss sayying - we are super close friends liike family   
2. okay fine - if you are family. she should come around to our place. see me. know me. talk to me. none of this private dates, just to see him. if he's so important to you. know me. tf. 

It honestly just feels like he takes her feelings into consideration SOOO FUCKIING much more than mine. don't you think this makes me uncomfortable? he slept with her. I feel insecure. weird. horrible. i feel like he is doing everything possible to protect her feeling shitty about the situation. Like i even notice how when she asks him how is day has been, he says ""oh was with friends"" ... when I was with him all day/ no friends.

1p9jb54,https://www.calbike.org/trust/,“Trust Is Infrastructure”: How LA Metro’s Nina Kin Is Building Better Data for Transit Riders on Bikes,"""To understand why data accuracy matters to LA Metro’s riders, Nina Kin — Tech Lead on LA Metro’s Digital Experience Team — often points to moments like this:

*It’s 7:48 a.m., and a parent on a tight schedule is trying something new: leaving the car at home. She drops her child at daycare, locks her bike, and jogs to the bus stop, coffee in hand. The app says the bus will arrive in three minutes, then one, then nothing. The icon disappears, the bus never comes, and by the time another line rolls past, trust has already left.*

Quiet failures in an otherwise ordinary morning that shape how Angelenos decide whether to trust public transit again.

Metro, the agency that once embodied car-era Los Angeles is beginning to recognize how bikes and transit aren’t separate systems — they’re halves of the same promise.

When we talk about infrastructure, we usually mean concrete. For Kin, though, the foundation of a great transit system isn’t poured; it’s published via an app with a superb user experience.

“We really want the customer experience to be a focus on the same level as operations,” Kin says.

...Kin’s world runs on a few unglamorous acronyms that quietly shape every trip you take: **GTFS** and **GBFS**.

**GTFS**, the *General Transit Feed Specification*, is the open-data format that lets your phone tell you when the next bus will arrive. **GBFS**, the *General Bikeshare Feed Specification*, does the same for bike-share systems: where docks are, how many bikes are waiting, and whether there’s space to return one at your destination.

To most riders, those acronyms are invisible. But to Kin, they represent the nervous system of public mobility, the difference between trust and frustration. A “ghost bus,” or one that does not appear when scheduled, isn’t just a missed ride — it represents a broken promise. When a bus app says five minutes and the bus never shows up, it changes how people plan their lives. They start padding their commutes, stop believing arrival times, or give up on transit altogether.

That emotional impact is exactly what Kin is trying to solve: “When people see that the information matches reality, they feel like the system respects their time.”

The same principle applies to bikes. Both standards help riders trust what they see in their apps today, but Kin is focused on what they could enable tomorrow. A near future where the two feeds talk to each other where a trip planner app doesn’t just tell you the next train but shows the safest, low-stress bike route to get there, and whether there’s a dock or secure rack waiting when you arrive.""",4,1764403016.0,CarIndependentLA,1,1.0,False

We're 9-3, just beat the defending champs in their stadium, while their fans booed them off their own field and let the handful of Bears fans turn Lincoln Financial Field into Soldier Field East.

The BETTER:

We didn't get fireworks from Caleb Williams (I'm still waiting for that 300+yard passing game from him, but I'll take wins over stat-padding any day), but we got really good gameplay, relatively few mistakes and miscues, and our running backs made the Eagles look pathetic.

The BEST:

This picture. Our team. Our coach. I haven't seen a better picture for the Bears off the field since the end of the Bears-Saints game in 2006 when Lovie Smith's Bears cliched the NFC Championship in a blowout to cement our trip to Super Bowl 41, and a couple players dumped Gatorade over Smith's head. I think the Chicago Sun-Times ran a still of that where Lovie was frozen mid-smile as the Gatorade washed over him. It was magnificent. This picture? This just speaks to how much better things are right now versus that 2006 team led by Urlacher and Briggs, Tillman and Brown, and sparked by Hester.

Everything has changed.

Last offseason, either here in this subreddit or in NFCNorthMemeWar, I made a joking comment under some post or another that the Bears wouldn't be better than 7-10 and not have a top-10 pick in the 2026 draft.

Whether I was joking or not, I am heartily eating well-deserved crow, and it is delicious.

Find a better version of this without logos or captions, but if the Bears end up making a deep run in the playoffs... this image will become absolutely iconic.

If we end up making it to the Super Bowl... and even win it? This image will probably end up on the cover of the coffee table book that will inevitably be written to encapsulate this magical season.",18,1764402864.0,CHIBears,3,1.0,False

I need your advice. Im f27 and about to open up my own business. My father came from where he lives (one hour away from me) to help building the shop interior. 
Both my partner and i are completely fed up with him by now because nothing we do is right and my father always knows better but does not listen and then gets pissed. I even started asking if everyone is on board whenever we rainchecked to make sure he did indeed understand. He tells me yes yes and then 2 seconds later says something that makes me internally facepalm myself because it basically shows that he didnt understand ANYTHING and i have to start explain again. Yesterday he told me im so ungrateful and have no respect because i said after he told us again and again that e can work with anyone but the way we work is very exhausting and difficult. I said i am very thankful for your help and appreciate it but - just to say it - if you feel like it just doesnt work out at any point it is okay to leave, absolutly no hard feelings. You helped a lot already so its totally fine. 
Btw i have influenza and he too now. 

My partner and i both dont want my father at the shop today because we just cant get anything done. 

The absolute nail in the coffin to me was when he used the electric saw yesterday around 8:30 p.m. in my city you have to stop doing that at 8 p.m. especially in a house where there are normal people not just shops. I am very aware of that and anyone that knows me knows that. My father said my partner was an idiot when he did that 3 days ago. Yesterday my father did it saying ""just this one thing"" that was totaly unnecessary and could even have been avoided had he just talked. 
So basically my no didnt mean anything.

I know that once i tell him i dont want him there i will be the ungrateful daughter. I even tried getting him to pick up parcels for me - even getting some coffee from the coffeeshop on the other side of the house is not something he wants to do.

I’m planning my first solo trip for August 2026 and wanted to get a reality check on whether my route is actually doable in 14 days, or if I’m being too optimistic.

My rough plan is:
Hamburg → Prague → Vienna → Venice → Switzerland (Zürich/Bern/Basel, not sure yet) → Paris → London → Brussels → Rotterdam → back to Hamburg.
I already bought the 1st-class Interrail Pass (7 travel days in 1 month). Also, Brussels and Rotterdam are not that important to me, so I could see myself doing both on the last day before going back to Hamburg.

I mainly have two questions:
1. Is this realistic/comfortable in 14 days?
-I do not plan to thoroughly explore every city. I wanna get the vibe, see a few major sights and enjoy a nice coffee. I want to stay longer in Prague, London, Paris, and possibly Venice?

2. Where do night trains actually make sense on this route?
-I thought that the night train from Prague to Vienna could be a good option. Maybe even more?

1p9j5sg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrQhTOSZntY&t=93s,Flux2 on Gamma Just Changed AI Images,"If you’ve ever tried to make AI characters that stay consistent across images, you know how frustrating it is.

You generate one picture — the character looks perfect.  
You make another — suddenly the face changes, the hair color’s wrong, and it looks like a totally different person.

That problem is finally over.

Flux2 just dropped on **Gamma**, and it completely changes the game. You can now keep your characters perfectly consistent across every single image. Same face, same hair, same clothes — every time.

This is one of the biggest AI breakthroughs for artists, creators, and storytellers we’ve seen yet.



Watch the full breakdown below

🚀 [Join the AI Profit Boardroom](https://juliangoldieai.com/7QCAPR) — the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with AI automation.

Inside, you’ll learn how to:

* Automate creative workflows using tools like Flux2
* Build AI systems that run your content and marketing on autopilot
* Get real training, templates, and case studies from Julian Goldie’s team



# What Is Flux2?

Flux2 is the latest version of the **Flux AI image model**, now available on **Gamma**.

Flux was already known for its realism and artistic precision — many say it even rivals Midjourney — but this new version adds something every creator has been begging for: **character consistency**.

Now you can create a character once and reuse them across any number of images without losing their look.

Think of it as giving your AI “actors” real identities.



# Why This Is a Big Deal

Until now, making stories, comics, or branded visuals with AI was nearly impossible to keep consistent.

You’d design one character — brown hair, freckles, green jacket — but when you tried to make the next image, the face shape would change, the colors would shift, and everything fell apart.

Flux2 on Gamma fixes that with something called **“ingredients.”**

You upload two key reference images — a **front view** and a **back view** — of your character.  
These act as the “ingredients” that define their look.

Once you’ve saved them, Gamma remembers those details — face structure, hairstyle, outfit, proportions — and keeps them consistent in every new image you make.

You can put your character anywhere — a forest, a coffee shop, a beach, even space — and they’ll look exactly the same.

No more guessing, no more regenerating dozens of prompts.



# How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Create your character.** In Gamma, go to Flux2 and describe your character in detail. Example: “Young woman in her 20s, red hair, denim jacket, white sneakers, casual pose.”
2. **Generate two key views.**
   * First, create a **front view** (facing the camera).
   * Then, make a **back view** (same character from behind).
3. **Save those two as ingredients.** Once saved, Gamma remembers these as your core character references.
4. **Start building scenes.** Now, when you prompt something like: “My character sitting at a café in Paris,” or “My character walking through a neon-lit city,” Flux2 automatically applies those same visual traits.

Every single image that follows uses the same “ingredients” to ensure perfect consistency.

You can even mix in new backgrounds or lighting styles, and the character still looks identical.



# Why It Works So Well

Flux2 doesn’t just copy and paste pixels — it **learns your character’s features**.

It analyzes bone structure, color palette, lighting, and proportions. It then understands how to redraw those features under new conditions — new angles, poses, and scenes — without changing the identity.

That’s why you can rotate your character, move them to different environments, or show them in motion without losing accuracy.

This level of realism used to require 3D modeling or professional illustrators.  
Now, it happens instantly in the browser.



# The Gamma Advantage

Gamma makes Flux2 easy to use even if you’re not technical.

You don’t need a powerful PC or complicated setup — everything runs in your browser.  
All you do is:

* Log in
* Go to the Flux2 section
* Click “Create Character Ingredients”
* Generate your front and back views
* Then start creating scenes

Gamma also saves your projects, so you can come back later and pick up where you left off.

If you want, you can even organize your characters into different folders — story projects, brand mascots, educational visuals, and more.

Everything’s stored online, and you can generate new images in seconds.



# Why This Matters for Creators

If you’re a **storyteller**, you can finally illustrate your stories with the same characters scene after scene.

If you’re a **marketer**, you can design a brand mascot that stays identical across all your campaigns.

If you’re a **teacher or course creator**, you can create one instructor character and reuse them in every lesson graphic.

And if you’re a **content creator**, you can develop recurring characters that your audience actually recognizes.

Consistency builds recognition — and recognition builds trust.

That’s why this update is so powerful for building a visual brand identity with AI.



# How It Compares to Other Tools

Other AI tools like Midjourney or Leonardo AI tried solving character consistency through reference images, but the results were unreliable.

Lighting changes, prompt randomness, and model differences made it nearly impossible to get a stable character across multiple shots.

Flux2 on Gamma changes that completely.  
It’s stable, fast, and accurate — and it works the same every single time.

It’s not just another version of “similar face.”  
It’s true identity locking for your AI-generated people.



# Real Use Cases

Here are just a few examples of how people are already using Flux2 on Gamma:

* **Comic creators** are making entire story panels with recurring characters.
* **Educators** are creating teacher avatars that appear in every lesson slide.
* **YouTubers** are generating their own visual mascots for thumbnails and branding.
* **Marketers** are building virtual spokespeople for ad campaigns.
* **Authors** are illustrating their stories consistently without hiring artists.

It’s like having a professional illustrator on your team — only faster, cheaper, and infinitely scalable.



# What Makes Flux2 So Fast

Flux2 is built on a **diffusion model**, which means it starts from noise and refines that into a detailed image based on your prompt.

But unlike older models, it includes a **character embedding layer** that locks in key traits from your ingredients — so the model knows exactly how your subject should look at all times.

This is why Flux2 can generate high-quality, photorealistic or illustrated-style images in seconds — while maintaining perfect consistency.

And because it runs on Gamma’s infrastructure, you don’t need a graphics card or local setup. Everything’s cloud-based and optimized for speed.



# Why This Update Changes Everything

Before Flux2, you could make cool one-off AI images.  
Now, you can build worlds.

You can develop full stories, characters, and brands that persist across time and space.

Flux2 gives creators the power to design their own universes — fast.

It’s not just about art anymore. It’s about storytelling, marketing, and education powered by AI characters that look *real* and stay consistent.

If you’ve been waiting for AI to actually be usable for serious creative projects, this is it.

Flux2 is the missing piece.

TLDR : A lady 10-15 years older than me keeps staring at me at the gym. I tried ignoring but it didn’t help. How do I talk to her about this? It irritates me. Can’t change the gym/time due to membership and schedule. 


So for context, I am a Male.
I go to the gym in the morning. ( I can’t change the time nor the gym because of membership and my day schedule)

There is this lady ( not sure about her exact age but 
she is around 10-15 years older than me)

Now she keeps staring at me mid workout. And before you say that she is probably zoning out, she is not. I am saying this because she follows me if I move and if I look back at her, then her expressions changes as if wanting to initiate a conversation.

I tried to do what anyone would do, ignore it. But then since a few days she has started working out around me. I once caught her taking a selfie in a way that I get in it ( idk how to say it, but you get it)

So the gym has around 15-20 people working out at a time max. And today she brought tea and coffee for everyone which was nice.

Someone else was telling everyone to have it. So I did too ( I didn’t know she brought it ) and then I had some.

Then the other guy told me that she brought it and then I thanked her. 

After some time I see her again doing the same thing.

What do I do? Should I approach her and talk it out? But then what do I even say? 
It should be something neutral as I don’t want to make it weird.

Why is it a problem? I have been an introvert for my life and I am not really great at focusing when such things happen. Sometimes I loose the count of reps, sometimes I slip out of the form. It’s just too irritating.


Edit 1: 

Thank you everyone for your inputs. I read all the comments and

1.	⁠I am not so sure about filing an official complaint ( someone already mentioned that how I may like to sort things out calmly)
2.	⁠I can’t and don’t wish to approach her in an aggressive manner like confronting her because that could really backfire and that would be really weird.
3.	⁠I don’t think my form is so perfect that people would keep staring that too on a daily basis.

Someone mentioned making a formal talk… I will greet her good morning tomorrow and see if she stops staring (idk how that will work, but chatgpt suggested this 🙂)



Edit 2:

Same thing was happening today. So I just greeted her good morning when she was staring ( so that she knows that I have noticed her staring at me)

I thought this would prevent her from staring again (I would have done this if it was vice versa)

On the way out I met her again and since my gym is walking distance I was on my way. Turns out she also lives nearby and walks to the gym as well.

She started small talk and asked me the following questions:
Q: Are you new to this gym ? Ans : yes
Q:How long have you been working out? Ans : I just started again after a gap of a year
Q:Married or single? Ans: single

Then I had to go a different way and that’s what happened today.

I am planning to ask her directly why does she keep looking at me in the gym

1p9j341,https://i.redd.it/fupercfmh54g1.jpeg,Market is crap. Here’s how to network now so you don’t get caught in the storm later,"Everyone says “just network” but nobody explains how.

You've probably heard at least some of these things before. But I can't stress how important it is for you to try at least some of them in this kind of job market where online applications alone don't cut it. 

1. Join industry Slack/Discord communities. Search “[your field] Slack” and find where people in your industry hang out. Lurk for a week, then start answering questions and helping people. After you’ve contributed, mention you’re job searching in the right channels. You’re building relationships by being useful first.

2. Do coffee chats. Find 10 people whose work interests you. Message them: “I’m exploring [area] and your work caught my attention. Got 20 minutes for a call?” Prepare actual questions. Listen. Follow up with thanks.

3. Go to local meetups. In-person beats virtual. Talk to 3 new people per event. Have your intro ready. Exchange contact info with people you click with.

4. Comment on LinkedIn posts. Follow 20-30 people in your industry. Leave thoughtful comments (not “great post!” garbage). Do this for 4-6 weeks. You become a familiar face before you ever reach out directly.

5. Informational interviews about specific roles. Target companies you want. Find people in similar roles. Ask about their day-to-day and how they got there. Near the end: “If a position opened, what makes someone a strong candidate?”

6. Alumni networks. People from your school want to help. Join alumni groups, reach out mentioning your shared background, attend events.

7. Create content. Post about what you’re learning. Be specific and helpful. “Here’s how I solved X” beats motivational bullshit. People who show their expertise publicly get noticed.

None of this works if you only care about what people can do for you. That's why you should start doing this now, so you can build relationships with people organically rather than reaching out out of the blue just because you need something.

Owntric pulled the latest numbers from its most recent Reg CF / Form C filing, and the headline looks like this:

By the numbers:

🧾 Security type: Common Stock (equity)

💸 Valuation: $75.35M

📈 Revenue (latest period): $824.25K

📉 Net income: -$467.33K

💵 Price per share: $1.54

👥 Reported employees: 2


What Kara Water does

Kara Water builds devices that pull moisture from the air and turn it into drinking water for home use — positioned as a premium, sustainability-focused appliance in the emerging air-to-water category.


Why some investors may be excited 🟢

Taps into water scarcity + climate themes with a tangible, at-home product

Simple, marketable story: “Turn air into mineral water at home”

Early revenue on a very small team suggests real commercial traction


What investors will likely watch closely 🔍

A $75.35M valuation paired with sub-$1M revenue and a net loss means a lot is riding on future execution

Hardware businesses typically require careful attention to manufacturing, logistics, and capital needs

Long-term outcome may depend on how well Kara Water navigates scale-up and competition in this category


How do you price this kind of raise?

Does a $75.35M valuation on $824K revenue / -$467K net income feel reasonable for a climate-focused hardware company issuing Common Stock on StartEngine?

When you look at deals like this, what matters more: story and category potential, or current financial profile and execution risk?

With tinnitus I have good days and bad days.. Sometimes it's hissing other times its PEEEEEE.. Sometimes I don't notice it at all. I stopped checking for spikes and controlling coffee.. Mine does not get worse with caffeine. I was actually scared of coffee and going to the gym at first because I thought coffee would make it worse and I'd wreck my neck while working out indirectly affecting my tinnitus, or I'd control my breathing unevenly (Vasalva maneuver) which would worsen my tinnitus.  But weirdly both coffee and gym ended up helping me.  Coffee doesn't spike it at all and gym helps me lower it by making it not so important in my head. 

Now some personal drawbacks from tinnitus for me are I can't lie down on my bed like I used to keeping my ears on the pillow normally, I have to sleep in the army posture😹.. Also I have to keep some ambient sound (mostly my table fan) on whenever it's a bad ringing day.

 Life is still good tho I can't wear headphones anymore as much.. I used to be immortal in valorant but sadly I cannot chill with my friends anymore. But life goes on .. Recently started learning guitar to keep up the joy of music in my life.

What makes me sad is that my dad has really bad hearing but he is old so idk if I will ever get to that stage.. I don't visit this subreddit much as well because reading some of these extreme cases makes me anxious and paranoid which I would like to avoid. 

One incident that gave me anxiety or fear of sound was when, while riding my bike someone honked a fucking truck near my ear and I felt so paranoid for days tho it came down to its normal level..Later I bought a pair of earplugs for heavy traffic and events. 

One coping tactic that I use is I tell myself every day that people get Tinnitus or hearing loss all the time.. Some get it from concerts some from the stupidest things like neck or TMJ idk.. Moving on with life I quit listening to music and gaming.. Life feels a little odd but it's manageable when you get new hobbies.. Also our brains make even small problems feel larger when we have newly discovered tinnitus.. 

All my fellas keep rocking whatever you love in life.. It's good with or without tinnitus.. Never let it rule ur mind.. And it gets good. Peace ☮️",2,1764401608.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

This post is not advocating for religious people or religion 

This post is not advocating for religious people or religion, because extremely religious people are also a whole other can of worms.

But yeah, idk how many of yall remember that time but *oh my God* (yeah that’s right, capital G) were these people the most cynical, smart ass, ego maniacal edgelords I’ve seen in a while. They may be up there with the virtue signalling identity politics people of 2016-present. 

When I tell you these people were obsessed with fundamentally deconstructing not even religious, but even quasi-spiritual people’s entire sense of reality I’m really not exaggerating. They literally believed they were thought-saviours and were no different than religious missionaries.

Look, I have no hands in this. My religious beliefs are private and poorly defined at best but I’ve always opposed religion in public. So when I tell you it was unbecoming to be a theistic young person from like 2010-2014 I’m not lying. This atheism culture was the *rage* of urban millennials and they were so headstrong and ardent to show it off (in real life) and impart it on to younger generations, which honestly was not their business. 

R/atheism used to be a default subreddit on here. Nobody credible wanted to correct the atheists either because going against atheism equaled going against “logic”. It was honestly rude and unnecessary and clearly most people posting on there were going through some sort of crisis. Some were just rebelling and finding their intellectual self through Reddit (ha), and others were just overreacting to being raised a Mormon in their town of 700 people and not being allowed to drink coffee or whatever it is they can’t do in that religion.

This coincided with the “ho-hey” Lumineers, we are young, infinity scarves, overpriced millennial burger restaurant era. These were dark times people. ",0,1764401523.0,The10thDentist,15,0.22,False

The ONLY thing that I haven’t changed or even thought about is going gluten free. Ive been eating rolled oats every morning for as long as I can remember (definitely 3 years ago) and have been eating pasta, cereal and nut bars that have gluten in it.

1p9itpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/serialkillers/comments/1p9itpx/gainesville_ripper_ripple_effect_impacts/,Gainesville Ripper - ripple effect impacts,"So this article illustrates all the knock on impacts these evil pricks cause on far, far more people than just their victims.

[The Serial Killer Who Inspired Scream terrorised my College Town 35 years ago & left me too terrified to sleep](https://people.com/serial-killer-gainesville-ripper-danny-rolling-exclusive-11763591)

And it reminds me of my own peripheral experience with this horrible mass killing.  It is nothing as serious as the authors' let alone the victims families, but shows how far the impacts can extend.

And apologies for the long post but I have wanted to tell this story for 35 years.

I was a 21 year old Aussie holidaying in the US with some mates and late Aug 1990 found us in Cocoa Beach a couple hours south of Gainesville. We were staying there whilst visiting Cape Canaveral and waiting to see a Space Shuttle launch in a few days (it got cancelled).

We had been at a local bar that night where service men and women were being farewelled for the (1st) Gulf War. Late evening we left the bar to get a pizza I think.

In the car park waiting for our pizza, a big 5 litre Camaro pulled up with a young lady of similar age who was extremely distressed and seemingly intoxicated. I recalled her from the bar and asked her what was wrong. She told us that her sister was one of the victims at Gainesville which we had heard about on that evening's news.

She understandably seemed very erratic, and we were worried about her safety.  Asked if we could call the police to help her but she didn’t want that.  Eventually I convinced her to come get a coffee from a late-night diner a few miles down the road where we could maybe talk through how to help her.  She tearfully agreed.  I suggested she leave the Camaro and we get a cab, but she wouldn’t have a bar of that.   She asked me to jump in the passenger seat to direct her while my friends could get a cab.

I don’t know why I got in her car; even as a bullet proof 21 year old who had had a few drinks, I must have known it was a bad decision.  But I got in.  What ensued was a 15 minute or so drive that I thought would be the last of my life.

This poor girl took off, still in tears and drove that huge car extremely fast and extremely erratically.  I was sure we were going to have a high speed accident.  The whole time we were driving she was yelling that we have to find the killer whilst I was begging her to slow down.  She then pulled out a pistol which didn’t make me feel any better.  We went flying past the diner at probably 75 mph and in no time we were on a deserted road with swamp either side.  Her driving and yelling got worse the further we went.

I was 100% sure I had to get out of that Camaro very soon or likely die.  I was trying to calculate the merits of jumping when she asked me what was wrong.  I told her she was going to kill us both, so she then slammed on the brakes, coming to a dead halt in the middle of the road.  I could have gotten out then, but it seemed like all the adrenalin left her and she apologised profusely.  

She did a u turn and we drove sedately back to the diner, but when we arrived it had closed.  My friends had arrived there in a cab and were waiting, wondering what happened to me.  I got out of the car then and we all tried to talk her again into letting us call the police. But she became angry and erratic again and pointed the pistol at us threatening us.  We backed off and she yelled some final threats and drove away at high speed. 

No doubt we should have called the police then as she was clearly a danger to herself and potentially others.  But for some reason we didn’t.  We just walked back to our motel a mile or so away.  Checked the news next day and no mention of any incidents in the area so hopefully she made it wherever she needed to be safely.

So I can’t know for sure that she was the sister of a victim.  She seemed ok at the bar earlier in the night.  But maybe she had just gotten the news her sister was a victim a few minutes earlier? And maybe she was having an unrelated medical episode.  Either way her distress was 100% real and I very much felt she was being sincere in the moment that the most horrible thing had just happened to her sister and her family.

It strikes me that there are likely a million stories like this of what impacts there are on victims friends and families and then the ripple effects on those who interact with them.

I think about this night and that girl from time to time.  I think what it must have been like for her when the Scream movies got released, on each anniversary of the killings, when articles and posts like this are published.  I really just hope she was ok and that she has gotten past whatever had her in that state that night.  It still makes me very sad 35 years later.",3,1764401240.0,serialkillers,1,1.0,False

# Introduction

When you start planning your home interiors, the toughest part is not picking materials or colors — it’s figuring out **how to choose the right interior theme**. Most homeowners feel confused because every style looks beautiful online, but not every style matches their lifestyle, maintenance comfort, space layout, or lighting conditions.

This blog breaks down the real pain points people face and explains exactly how to **choose the right interior theme** with clarity, confidence, and practical criteria. You’ll also learn the technical side of each style — from textures to color temperatures — so your decisions are not based on trends alone but on what actually works for your home.  




# 1. What Does It Mean to Choose the Right Interior Theme?

To **choose the right interior theme**, you must select a unified design direction that guides your material selection, furniture style, color palette, textures, lighting, and décor aesthetics.

A theme acts as the foundation for:

* Your mood and lifestyle
* Daily maintenance
* Visual harmony
* Long-term durability
* Functionality and flow

Without a theme, interiors feel mismatched, cluttered, and inconsistent — which is the biggest reason homeowners feel dissatisfied with the final outcome.



# 2. Pain Points Homeowners Face When Choosing an Interior Theme

# 1. “I like too many themes and can’t decide.”

This happens when Pinterest saves become overwhelming. Every style looks good in isolation but may not suit your space.

# 2. “I don’t know what theme will suit my home layout.”

Example: small rooms cannot handle dark industrial tones without proper lighting planning.

# 3. “I’m scared of choosing something that looks outdated later.”

Trendy themes that are poorly adapted can age quickly.

# 4. “I want low maintenance, but I also want my home to look stylish.”

Many themes look great but require high maintenance (example: glossy finishes show fingerprints easily).

# 5. “I don’t know how to maintain visual consistency.”

Most homeowners mix too many materials or colors unintentionally.

This guide solves all these pain points with practical, technical insights.



# 3. How to Choose the Right Interior Theme Based on Your Lifestyle

Before you look at Pinterest boards, start with these core questions:

# 1. How much natural light do you have?

* Low light → lighter palettes (Minimalist, Scandinavian)
* High light → bold palettes (Modern, Industrial)

# 2. How much time can you spend on maintenance?

* Low maintenance → matte finishes, neutral tones, fewer décor layers
* High maintenance → glass, glossy laminates, statement décor pieces

# 3. Who lives in the house?

* Kids → rounded furniture, washable fabrics
* Elderly → slip-resistant flooring, warm lighting
* Young couples → theme flexibility + modern materials

# 4. What is your personality?

* Calm & organized → Minimalist / Scandinavian
* Bold & creative → Modern / Industrial

Your lifestyle must decide the theme — not the other way around.



# 4. Minimalist Theme: Who It Suits, Technical Tips & Common Mistakes

A minimalist interior revolves around clean lines, clutter-free surfaces, and soft color palettes.

# Best for You If:

* You want calm, breathable spaces
* You prefer simple layouts
* You dislike heavy décor
* You want easy maintenance

# Technical Insights:

* **Color Palette:** White, beige, greige, pale taupe
* **Texture Rule:** Maximum 2–3 textures per room
* **Lighting:** Neutral white (3500K–4000K) works best
* **Furniture:** Sleek, low-height, no heavy carvings

# Common Mistakes:

* Empty rooms that feel “lifeless”
* Overuse of whites causing maintenance issues
* Lack of accent textures leading to dullness



# 5. Modern Theme: Material Choices, Color Logic & Layout Planning

A modern interior is structured, elegant, and defined by clean geometry.

# Best for You If:

* You want a polished look
* You prefer straight lines and symmetry
* You enjoy luxurious yet functional spaces  

# Technical Insights:

* **Materials:** Glass, high-gloss laminates, PU finishes, veneer
* **Colors:** Greys, earthy browns, whites, charcoal
* **Lighting:** 3000K warm lighting highlights glossy surfaces
* **Layouts:** Focus on horizontal and vertical lines

# Avoid This Mistake:

Glossy materials look good but show fingerprints easily in Indian homes. Choose semi-gloss where possible.



# 6. Industrial Theme: Texture Balance, Lighting & Practical Considerations

Industrial interiors combine raw, unfinished textures with dark tones.

# Best for You If:

* You love bold, masculine aesthetics
* You enjoy metallic accents
* You want a theme that feels artistic and edgy

# Technical Insights:

* **Textures:** Concrete, rough wood, exposed brick, brushed metal
* **Color Palette:** Charcoal, coffee brown, smoke grey
* **Lighting:** Warm (2700K–3000K) to soften dark tones
* **Proximity Rule:** Use industrial textures close to each other to maintain theme consistency

# Practical Concern:

Too many dark elements can shrink small rooms. Industrial works best with ample lighting or larger spaces.



# 7. Scandinavian Theme: Natural Elements, Furniture Rules & Color Theory

A Scandinavian interior blends comfort with natural warmth.

# Best for You If:

* You want a cozy yet airy space
* You prefer natural textures
* You like soft color combinations

# Technical Insights:

* **Colors:** Off-white, oatmeal beige, sage green, pastel wood
* **Materials:** Natural wood, cane, fabric, knitted textures
* **Lighting:** Warm white to mimic natural sunlight
* **Furniture:** Soft curves, ergonomic shapes

# Avoid This:

Mixing too many décor pieces makes Scandinavian rooms look cluttered.



# 8. How to Maintain Theme Consistency Across Rooms

To truly **choose the right interior theme**, you must maintain a sense of flow across your home.

# Follow These Rules:

* Stick to one major color palette
* Choose no more than 2 wood tones in the entire home
* Repeat a material at least twice (e.g., brass handles + brass lights)
* Avoid mixing too many textures
* Ensure uniform lighting temperature across the home

Consistency = Professional-looking interiors

# Conclusion

Choosing an interior theme is not about copying Pinterest boards — it’s about understanding your space, habits, maintenance comfort, and long-term lifestyle. When you evaluate your home through technical, emotional, and functional lenses, you can easily **choose the right interior theme** that looks beautiful, feels comfortable, and stays timeless for years.

I've been using Gemini for a while, but recently, especially with the heavier models like Gemini 3, I've noticed a really frustrating issue regarding how it handles connectivity and active sessions.
The Problem:
When I give Gemini a complex prompt (especially on models that take a while to think/generate), I naturally want to switch contexts. For example, I might start the prompt on my PC and then grab my phone to check the result on the go, or simply lock my phone screen while waiting.
The Result:
The moment I disconnect, close the tab, or switch devices, Gemini aborts the generation and often deletes the entire chat.
It feels like the generation process is heavily dependent on the client-side connection. If the ""heartbeat"" with the browser/app stops, Google just kills the process immediately instead of letting it finish in the background.
The Comparison with ChatGPT:
This is a stark contrast to ChatGPT (especially with o1 or Deep Research modes).
 * ChatGPT: I can start a task that takes 20 minutes, close the app, go make a coffee, switch devices, and the process continues running server-side. It doesn't care if I'm watching or not.
 * Gemini: It basically demands that I stare at the screen. If I look away (disconnect), it punishes me by wiping the session.

Ride Or Die





It was one of those days in June. The kind that were so hot that the second the heat touched your skin it produced sweat. It would then trickle down continuously until you finally found any form of shade. Sometimes, the fences would be wrapped in signs that caused shade while climbing over them. If the train passed, though waiting made his shortcut worthless, also caused cooling for Ducky during his journey on foot.
That wasn't his real name of course. His real name was Francisco Rivera, but after a dumb joke about his apearance by some senior made last year,  he was now officially dubbed Ducky.  He never admitted it, but his nickname was sort of cute in a way. He felt like it gave some spice to his boring image and showed his light hearted side. The only problem he had was when people would compare the animal’s  feathers and beak to his own pale skin and full lips. People never understood why this bugged him. He was a cute kid, after all. He didnt have the kind of looks that people turned their heads every way he went. What he did have was a heart shaped face with eye bags that made him always get accused of being off some kind of substance. On the bright side, this was countered by his long and feminine eyelashes. Even though it was his most complimented feature, he didn't really like them due to their exaggerated length. They would brush on the lenses of his glasses which caused him discomfort. This would lead him to go seasons without his spectacles, causing his dark circles to pop even more.  He didn't care about looking uglier without his glasses too much since he was basically blind to most of his surroundings besides what was in front of him. “As long as there isn't a mirror to my face.” he would try to joke to himself. The only time he would decide to put them back on was when someone would add on to the already unfunny joke and say something stupid like“you're definitely playing the part now, huh, Franc-o. I mean ducks don't have glasses so props on being scientifically accurate.” which then be followed by giggles from anyone around. It was like this until his best friend Alexander realised it made Ducky uncomfortable. This made him try to cheer him up the best he could. “Yo it's fine, bro, don't worry. At least you're not getting compared to something ugly like a dinosaur. Ducks are the reason grandmas go to the parks and shit ""Alexander would say which boosted up Ducky’s morale. He always respected whatever Alexander would  have in his heart from the beginning. Every day was a new adventure to him. So much so that it would sometimes seep into Ducky's life. That's why Alex was the only person he liked hanging out with. That's why they hung out so much. Heck, Ducky even considered him his best friend, which he never dared to reveal. This was because he would always worry about the slight chance that Alexander didn't think the same about him. If Alex found out about this thought, he would think it was absolutely absurd since they both clearly knew he had a soft spot for Ducky.
Alex was even the one who tried to help him flip the script last year. He was the one who gave ducky the idea about air jordans. Before, Ducky only saw them as shoes cool people wore in the streets, and actors wore in movies. This changed once the seed was planted by Alex which later led Ducky to ask his older brother, Oscar, about them. This led him to buy a fresh pair of Air Jordan 1 Mid Light Smoke Grey a month later for his little Duckling. Even after such a gesture and gratitude from both siblings, Ducky still felt distance between him and  his brother. This showed by the very fact that he was walking down the streets as an uncool guy with his antique gifts under his aching heels. To him, wearing out his one year old jordans is even better than asking his brother for a ride to downtown shell creek.
The reason he was so motivated to show up was due to the  carnival coming to town between the african store and burrito shack (the two biggest businesses run by minorities). The African Store was a convenience store that centered around African needs like traditional wear, prayer rugs, and even food. After shopping, they would sometimes go across the street to the Burrito Shack to indulge in the best mexican foods in all of shell creek. So it was sort of a mutualistic relationship where both helped each other for customers. Ducky assumed the carnival was between the two as an attempt to be part of the relationship.
What also made the town look desperate was the fact that there had been a carnival in Shell Creek for the cinco de mayo weekend almost two months prior. No one knew why the town thought it was a good idea to bring a smaller white washed fair to compete with a celebration that was a hit due to ethnic pride. They all guessed corporate greed tried to use that communitarian mindset for more money which worked out horribly since a mile away from Ducky, there was an almost empty fair ground that looked nothing like the one in May. Heck, the two stores were booming much more that night than the fair they seemed to surround. I guess in Shell Creek , the start of one's story (like background) is more important than any temporary pleasure (like consumerism). Many people in town thought this except people like Ducky’s friend, Alexander De La Cruz. He didn't know the first thing about stuff like 'wokeness’ or “a public stance” over the carnival. All he wanted was something to do that night that didn't only involve himself. This plan worked since  Ducky only wanted to go because Alexander asked him to.
Finally, after 20 minutes of a fast paced walk and a liter of sweat scattered across the path, Ducky made it but with no sign of Alexander. He was annoyed but didn't plan on expressing it to him since Alex was known to not calculate when to start walking.
Once Ducky arrived, Alex was barely a quarter down the straight sidewalk from his house that led to the fair . He had a sort of wonder for the carnival. The sort that one felt when going outside with neighborhood friends in the summer. The details of the specifics weren't important since any kind of Adventure gave the same feeling. He enjoyed stuff with friends like playing tag at the ripe age of sixteen, or ding dong ditching random houses. He was a spectrum for nostalgia and mischief. He was fascinated by the latter a lot more even though one always had to get through the first half of the adventure which was walking there. He hated it and assumed Ducky’s path was always easier even though Alex’s  path was straight and simpler than Ducky's even though this was FAR from the truth. One of the reasons he believed this was because his journey was longer than Ducky’s which made him feel like he would never make it.
Distance was the problem to him many times, to be honest.  You see, Alexander had a girlfriend who lived an hour away. The only reason he even met her was since she went to his church. This was thanks to her family missing what they left behind once they moved away. It had been about a year from the carnival when she made the first move in the “Hijos De Dios” church. He didn't make it himself since at the time, Alexander had a justin bieber kind of swooped haircut and some beady rectangular glasses which didn't make him a lady’s man of any kind. Quite the opposite actually. This caused him to compensate by cracking jokes and getting all the other boys into trouble by his shenanigans. To him, this was worth the discipline since he always confused quiet with loneliness which always made him act in such a way that showed he wasn't afraid. This was probably why his Church girl caught feelings. She was so intrigued by his confidence.
So after group prayer, she went to the pew in front of where he and his parents resided a couple minutes ago. The pew that was now empty except with him there looking down, playing some crappy car game on his phone.
When he saw here, he quickly hid his phone in embarrassment as she looked at him with the same toothy smile she had since they were kids. That even though they never spoke a word, made her hard to miss.
 “Oh, here it comes,” he thought as if she was about to do the things girls do to the bottom of the barrel guys that were awkward, ugly, or special needs. Alexander had seen it happen to the latter, who was Cesar Martinez.
“Oh hi Cesar. How are you?""
“Look everyone, me and Cesar the RETARD are besties.”
He’d see girls say. Even if theyde never say or admit the last one, they felt it, which was still equally sas bad.
“Hi Loser, where is your family?” she said with the same smile. The loser comment stung him a little, even though he could tell it was only schoolyard talk. “Oh, uh, yeah, they are outside drinking coffee or something,” he sort of stuttered, as he felt any probable joke or remark drain from his shell. She was able to tell he was nervous and caught off guard. Any mean girl would've up and killed the conversation with “oh ok” and walked off, but she expected his reaction.
She then continued with “why arent you with them?” in a way that worried her if she potentially hit a dead end with a response.
“I mean…”
Alexander said while maintaining zero eye contact “I mean I don't drink coffee so…” He managed to say before all of his jokes were flushed out of him. She laughed and they began to talk for ten more minutes without stopping. They even got up and sat next to a giant coat rack just so it would take a while for either of their parents to look for them once it was time to go home.
She was the first to be called by a loud “Maria!” from her mother which was her cue to get in the car.
And there alexander sat alone. He realised in that moment of seeing her walk away and turn the corner that he was sitting on the ground like an idiot. He then got up but snapped back into his thoughts. He realised that the connection he felt with her was very different from an audience of people expecting you to entertain and lead like the church crew. Even though he was witty at heart, it felt more genuine in a way to speak to her. As if she was a sort of map to the real him.  He didn't want to lose this. He didn't want to lose her…
This led to his decision to “flip the script” like he used to joke about since even he knew he looked like a little kid that was on his xbox all night eating cheetos or something.
He learned to textured his hair into a spiky look and started experimenting with cargo pants and crew neck sweaters. He also ditched the glasses all together  and decided on squinting his way through life. This revealed him to be a very cute boy. One that made girls suddenly have an interest in him. He ignored all of them sine he knew that deep down he was still the boy his girlfriend saw something in when he was nothing. This was what motivated him to remain as loyal as he was to her. He felt as if he was exactly where he needed to be.
He eventually made it to the carnival. The main lights were an orange/yellow color which illuminated a couple stands here and there of food and games that both, weirdly, had recognisable scents. Eventually, Alex found Ducky sitting on the rim of a giant tree planter with the branches awkwardly caressing his hair. Ducky then noticed him and began walking towards. He was then interrupted by Alexander who noticed his shoes. “Still got the same Js, huh, Ducky.” he said as he went for a dap up that transformed into an arm wrestling kind of position. “Yup. still got the classic hoodie?” he said as he looked at Alex’dark green pullover that consisted of two roses on the chest.Alex then responded with a simple “chill” to buy time for a comeback. He then responded with “but like.. Have you checked the mileage on those things again? What is it at now?”. Ducky then smiled and put both hands on Alex’s shoulder and bicep as he turned him around to begin the exploration of the fairground.
There were about three main rides. There was the Zero Gravity that was a hit every time it came, especially when it spun on its side at the very end. That one was Ducky’s favorite since you could see every reaction in it and worry about people getting flinged overboard. He wasn't an idiot, he was actually quite smart to understand that wasn't possible. He just liked to shut off his brain once in a while and act dumb for lots of stuff like the fact that it was impossible for anyone to fly off the ride once it was rotating. There was the bullet which was a claustrophobic person's worst nightmare. Only two people per small chamber that your lap would be in much more pain than any amount of fear or excitement in your body. That one was hell for ducky but not for Alexander due to his shorter stature which was why he was planning on spamming that ride that night. The last ride was a giant yellow slide that one had to have a burlap sack  for some reason to go down it at full speed. Everyone that was ever on it said that it was more of a one time ride and wasn't a very good investment to bring that night.
Eventually, they put some money together for two rides each while in the line for the ticket booth. They then received them and made their way to the bullet which seemed the most fun. While up next in line for the bullet, Alexander began to look up as if he was wondering something. Ducky then noticed and nudged him. “What are you thinking about”. Alexander, getting caught off guard by the contact from Ducky, had to adjust his stance. “Chill. But like, I wonder what the chances are that something on there fails right when it's finally our turn to get on” Alexander said as Ducky was listening with all ears. There was a pause right when Alexander finished which was then broken, not by sound, but a big proud smile from Dewey as if proud that he came up with a response. “Well, Alex. We put all our money together for our tickets, and ten minutes on this line. If it was to fall apart with us inside it, that would make it worth the money and wait.”Ducky then continued to smile. He usually hid his smile since his whole life he was told it was ugly. Everyone was unfamiliar with it except Alexander. That was the formula for lots of stuff between the two. Other people caught on to that and would joke about the boys being the cutest couple.
Then, as Alexander was about to add on to his hypothetical, he was interrupted by the operator of the ride. “The boy in the chamber gave me two admissions so he is going again, fellas. One of you two have to get on without the other, right now."" he said with two of his teeth slipping form his lips after ever word. They then looked at eachother and Ducky rose is hand for some reason and offered to go first. “Wait for me here until i get off” he yelled as the man fastened the belt around him and mason Gordon, who always smelled like cigarettes even though he was barely ten years old. This always made Ducky gag but he didnt realise who it was until it was too late As the ride slowly ascended, Ducky looked down and saw as someone walked up to Alexander and tapped his right shoulder. He couldnt make up who it was until the ride began and quickly spun like a windmill and was able to see who it was once he made it to the lowest point.
He recognised her with the split second he saw got a good look. It was  Ariana. A short, brown girl, with long hair, high cheek bones, and native cat eyes that made it difficult to tell if she was looking at you or forward in the hallways. Ducky mostly knew her by the alias “That one Pizza girl”. He would mostly remember her from that name since the only way he knew about her existence was through Alexander. You see, she offered Alexander free food from her job multiple times while helping him apply to the pizza parlor she worked at.
She was of no help since he didn't get the job. Ducky assumed it was probably because she wasn't the best reference to have due to the only reason she was even employed was because her brother, Eddy. Ducky’s brother told him that Eddy was always working till close which showed that the managers noticed his responsibility and, I guess, assumed his sister would be the same. She was very close with her brother so she enjoyed working in the same place until he started getting in the way of her and boys. She obviously had to be sneaky when talking to any friend who was a boy. So, once the bullet ride took another lap, She began to gently pull Alex away from the ride as Ducky saw while going at top speeds. He wasn't offended since he was able to tell that Alex was hesitant. He was probably trying to explain that he was waiting for someone in line, even though she didn't let him finish his statement.
Once the ride ended, and Ducky was free of the terrible smell of chain smoking, he went around to try and find Alex. He assumed someone saw them, so he began to ask anyone he knew which was followed with shrugs. Just then, he ran into Alexander's cousin, Nacho in the space between two shops. Nacho was with the kids from church since he and Alex didn't really talk as much. Nacho was a brown kid with glasses and a sort of helmet haircut. A soon to be freshman that secretly knew too much about everyone. “Hey, uhh. Do you know where Alexander is?” ducky asked while putting his hand on Nacho’s chest which stopped him in his tracks. “He should be with you, no?” Nacho said in a slight look of confusion”. Ducky then explained “No. Well, some girl took him to I don't know where. Have you seen Ariana at least?” Nacho then looked back at the church crew as if making sure they were hearing the same thing. “What is he doing with Ariana? Who even is Ariana?"" He then offered himself and the whole church kids to help find Alexander. The group included two brothers, Mateo, and Kleyder. Mateo was a year older with a skinny build while Kleyder was short and chubby with big, clear glasses. There was also Allan who was from the same town as Alex’s girlfriend. He was once Alexander’s best friend back when they were really young. This changed, though once Ducky took that spot which made it kind of awkward since you could tell Allan didn't like Ducky at all. They then began to all walk in a group looking for Alexander. They didn't split up since they were waiting for each other to suggest that. Allan and Mateo went into the African store, while Nacho, Ducky, and Kleyder went to search every line from rides to booths. The Ducky search party couldn't find him anywhere so far. Ducky and Kleyder then noticed Nacho was getting uneasy by the thought that Alex could be  alone with someone that wasn't his girlfriend. “Why are you getting nervous about something that isn't about you?” Kleyder joked as he slapped nacho in the face even though nacho was two years older. Ducky didn't even react since that was the normal amount of respect Nacho had from most people.
After the slap, Nacho looked down and then rotated his vision to the far off right where the Burrito Shack resided. He then gasped whichwas followed by the two other boys to ceck where his gaxe led. “I see them. Theyre in there” he said while feeling proud. They all then sped walked towards the large window at the front of the restaurant. They peered in to see that there was Alexander, Ariana, and one of her friends in that order. All of their backs were towards the boys but Ducky could tell Alex was receiving an horchata from the front register. Alex never had money so Ducky was able to figure out that Ari bought it for him. Once they figured out where he was, Ducky and Kledyder both lifted their heads from the pane. They then turned their heads to where Nacho was, expecting to discuss the next move. This wasnt the case since the spotNacho resided was empty. He was nowhere to be seen anymore which caused Kleyder to start walking back from where they came. “Come on, duckling. Lets go find Allan and tell him Nacho is long gone.” Ducky soon lost Kleyder in the crowd due to his short stature which made him have to go back alone. He soon made it back to the alley and found not only Kleyder and the Allan team, but also Nacho. He was looking down at his phone, using the Dental office next door’s Inyternet to send a message. That was what all the boys did when downtown due to not having any service. Alexander was the one that found out the dentist office had the strongest router out of the whole street. He called it “his little life hack” and joked to the church crew and Ducky to keep it a secret.

While they all stood in a circle, they heard someone coming up to them by the sound of the gravel that covered that pavement. As they turned, one by one saw it was Alex.“Nah, the dentist? Go out there and enjoy the fair, nacho. You lazy shit.” Ducky was the closest to Alex since his back was to the opening, so even though he was the last to see him, he was the first to respond. We were looking for you, man. I had to even get the church guys to get you.” Nacho then added a question to Ducky’s statement. “Yeah, where were you?” Nacho wasn't slow. He remembered where they saw Alex. He just wanted to see if he would lie to their faces. “Oh, shit!”. Alexander said in a way that Ducky wondered if he was sarcastic. Alex then began to shake the Styrofoam cup full of ice and horchata he was rewarded. “I was at the burrito shack. It's because Pizza Girl offered to buy me a drink since I was thirsty,” he said, with a face that revealed he found humour in the gesture. “I was waiting for you and I told her that but she was forcing me to go and I didn't want to be rude.” Allan then sat down on a staircase that was in the alley. He crossed his arms and broke his silence. “Damn, nigga. So a homegirl is buying you shit. You better do something.” Alex then chuckled, not sure of what Allan was alluding to. Allan then added a suggestion. “I mean… we’re all together. Let's all get on the rides. Ducky, give me your bracelet. We’ll share it”. Ducky then looked down at his wrist and responded. “I don't have one. I only got tickets”. Allan then looked disappointed. “Alright bet, guess we’ll use Mateo’s to get on stuff.” He didn't need to hear Mateo’s answer since he expected it to be a “yes”. Maybe even with a “sir” at the end of it. This was because the whole church crew was sort of scared of Allan. This was because he played rough and had instances of grabbing the younger boys and slamming them if they made him mad. He wasnt the strongest person in his school, but he was still stronger than all his friends from shell creek which was what mattered when he went into town.
They then started walking all together, about to get in line for the bullet once again. While Ducky and Alex were talking, they heard the sounds of a gel ball blaster being fired. They were able to recognise such a specific sound since they have had run-ins with a particular group of boys that enjoyed that kind of mischief.
Alex was the first to turn and make sure it was who he suspected. Ducky then followed his gaze and they saw them. Simon Guerrero and his band of goons. Simon was the tallest out of them all at 5 foot 9 which wasn't a crazy thing to achieve since the average height of Shell Creek Central was 5 foot 6. He was a sort of round build and curly brown hair that matched his skin. Ducky always avoided him due to him being very touchy. He was sort of an oxymoron since he had the thickest glasses in the whole Sophomore class last year and still had  all the boys afraid of being embarrassed by him. He had a good heart deep down. The only thing was that he never grew up so he’d get everyone into big trouble with the cops due to his natural leadership. Once Alex processed all this, he decided to ask Allan to hold his spot in line so he can go up to the guys. Not because he liked them and wanted to say what's up. Not even because he was  afraid of them either. He just wanted to get any harassment over with in that moment instead of getting annoyed all throughout the night.
Ducky was able to guess what Alexander was thinking, he always had been able to. Not just for Alex, but for everyone in general. He assumed it was because when he was a kid he never really got attention from his folks. Never an “i love you”. He knew they did love him but he had to see it through them himself (even though he wouldve killed to hear it). Most of the time he just needed to look into their eyes since it was always in the eyes. Sometimes he would see by other traits. Rarely it was the way they stood, walked, even the way their tears streamed down showed if it was their first “real” time bawling their eyes out. That wasn't Alexander, though. He never bawled so Ducky didn't need any discernment to crack that fact.
Ducky then grabbed alex’s bicep subtly so the goons wouldnt see and call them fags or something like that. Alex then turned back and they looked at each other as ducky struggled to word. “Ill go with you”.

The pod with Owen Thiele, omg I loved it! They're such a funny duo and there were so many good moments on there so highly recommend yall go watch it if you havent. I also feel like it showed a more personal side of Emma. Obviously shes more comfortable cause shes with her friend, but I also feel like they talked about a lot of stuff I didnt expect her to elaborate on. She talked about Owen and hers relationship, feelings about hookup culture and relationships, past relationships, fashion trends, and Emmas career. I literally wrote most of this in my notes app before i got to the part about her talking about her career and then I was like oml this is what ive been sayinggg. But anways it reminded me of why im such a huge fan of hers.

Emma is just so likeable. She's become a celebrity almost purely off of her personality. She started off as just a vlogger and has bursted her career into something extreme. She podcasts, she models, she dabbles in cinematography, shes friends with the IT girls of the celebrity world because she IS the original it girl. I mean who wouldn't want to be friends with her. Her career is just so interesting and she's done such a good job at working with what she has. Like shes now a fashion influencer. Its because people like her and people take fashion advice and want to look like people that they like. And emma is so well liked by everyone, just by being her. Its so cool. 

But it also speaks deeper into our society. People are lonely and spend more time on the internet than in reality. Less time spent making real relationships and more time getting to know people like emma. Its not necessarily a bad thing, its a good outlet for people to similulate connection in a world where thats become something so precious. People attached to her because people need a ""placeholder"" friend. And emma has used this to rise to fame. Imagine having fame just because your personality makes people so attracted to you, theyd listen to you talk for hours to, drink a coffee if you promote it, wear the clothes they see you wear. 

There was a Reddit post that said Emma is a filmmaker in the way she captures the mundane moments and makes them beautiful, and the most exciting moments and makes them seem mundane (she touches on this in the pod in the part where she says shes thankful for the mundane. This connection is what pushed me to post this lol). Its why I enjoy her videos, and why its a good type of video for her target audience. It captures the view of the world thats so necessary to have when things are going wrong. When your unhappy its always nice to stare up at the clouds and admire the color of the sky, or the birds chirping on the power lines, or the old man on the bench reading a book. She captures those moments and shares them with the world. Even when shes glamming up for the Met Gala or traveling the world she chooses to upload and share these moments. Her whole rise to fame seems so fantastical but holds a more dystopian undertone esp when examining her role as a ""placeholder"" friend. 

It sounds like an amazing way to rise to fame, but no doubt has downsides to it. I feel like thats why emma has recently became a lot more self introspective, and emphasizing her want to be her true self. Idk shes just such a cool person and I want to share why I find her so interesting, but realized that I'm in her audience for the same reason I mentioned earlier, the need for a friend lol.",7,1764399237.0,emmachamberlain,0,0.89,False
1p9i9gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p9i9gy/my_best_friend_has_been_ghosting_me_for_eight/,My best friend has been ghosting me for eight months.,"Alright, reattempt since I messed up my original submission and hit post too early on my phone... (I'm human, alright?)

I (18m) have - sorry, *had* a best friend, we'll call them G (18enby). This friend meant everything to me. I truly mean it, yeah - codependent, I know, but so were they.

I have to start from the beginning to let you actually understand how pissed I am about this. I was bullied. I was bullied *hard.* Threats, violence, attempted SA, and threats on my family. About my family, they were not the best either. So I met G when I was a freshman, about four years ago, and I was *not* nice. I hated everyone because everyone hated me, and G was insistent on being my actual friend, while I did nothing but flinch back and complain.

After nearly a YEAR of them nonstop giving me half of their lunches since I never ate, helping my panic attacks even when I told them to go away, I finally became good friends with them. I mean, first sleepover, they bandaged by cuts, told me I deserve life, made me feel like a person for the first time.

About nine months ago, when I got a small dinner together to celebrate me turning 18 with my friends, G was noticeably quieter. I asked if they were alright, they said yes. It was fun, good, I was happy with the small friend group I had gotten - I felt safe.

Then it all came crashing down, and I realized how fucking stupid I am. G didn't text me for a week. We did daily check-ins to make sure both of us were okay, but for a week, they hadn't. It got longer, I saw they were reading my messages but not answering. I wondered what I did wrong - an old instinct of mine as a victim of abuse. I didn't want to hurt G, I didn't want to be bad, to be the bad luck I was called when I was a little kid.

After about two months, they *finally* messaged me - they were busy. They were not - I knew this from discord, steam, they were **not** busy. They were avoiding me. I helped them with a relationship thing, they *only* reason they fucking texted me, just to get ghosted for the next six months.

In that time, they went to prom. My *entire* friend group went to prom. I may not like my bullies, I may have the worst fucking trauma from that high school, but this was a rented out event, I could've been invited, asked to go in, and not a soul even so much as sent me a tiktok out of that group for the past week.

So, in a spiral of self-hatred, wanting to escape that feeling of loneliness I had finally gotten away from just for it to come back so suddenly...

I tried to kill myself. It didn't work, clearly, but I woke up the next morning with only one message - from G. ""What the fuck."" No checkup, nothing beyond one singular message from someone who had made me feel I was so horrible.

I hated myself. I hated them, and afterwards, they didn't even check up on me. No one did. During this time, I was waiting for a way to be able to just end it again - stop this feeling, get rid of it because I let myself get weak and sappy and I cared about someone who hurt me so horribly.

In september, my friend convinced me to go to a football game. Exposure therapy, basically. people I didn't like, loud noises, lots of noises - ground myself while there, heal through scarring, really.

Yeah, I didn't know G would be there. I didn't know, and the minute I saw them, I froze. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't think, couldn't meet their eyes, because I was scared they'd stare at me with hatred.

I realized I was having a panic attack when they looked at me and I fully sobbed. The person who had kept me from jumping off of ledges, who had kissed my scars, bandaged my wrists, and taught me that human touch isn't always negative - the sight of them was giving me a panic attack.

I left early, walked home, cried a lot, and fell asleep.

They asked me if I was alright while I was asleep. The first sign of concern they'd shown in nearly five months was a pitiful ""hey, you good?"" I laughed at that. I said I'm fine, because deep down, I didn't want to hurt them. G was still important to me, still meant so much, and I didn't want to make them feel bad.

With a bit of prying, some of the surface level stuff spilled. My anxiety, my concern I hurt them, my depression was spiking at that time, and how much I just wanted to end it.

They asked to meet up for coffee the next day. I said yes, and when I saw them, that same anxious feeling. Heart racing, breathing heavy, my eyes tearing up, and when I wanted to say how I felt, how I felt unwanted and unloved by the closest thing I had a to a family...

""Oh, I know. I'm sorry. I forgave myself, though, so don't worry.""

Those words ring in my head everytime I think of G. They forgave their own shitty behavior. They left me for dead, didn't talk to me, made me feel loved just to abandon me when I was hitting a low point.

I had to see them on the 28th of september at a renn faire. It was a friend's birthday, and I tried being nice - smiling, jokes, and they never gave me a chance. Everything I did was met with judgement. I felt that feeling come back, even worse now. I had to separate myself from them as often as possible, focusing on making my friend happy on their birthday - giving them a hug, buying them a gift, teasing them - I was the best friend I could be to them.

And afterwards, not once, did G message me.

October 16th, my therapist gave me advice: tell them what they made me feel. Confess everything lay it out in the open because it is just *hurting* now. Endless hurting because of a situation I feel guilty for and feel like shit about.

I did as she asked, and here we are, a month later, no reply.

Then I went to the store, and guess who works there? that's right, G!\~ God just really hates me sometimes :D

I did not speak. I did not make a sound. I bought my groceries, walked out, and screamed as soon as I was in the car.

The reason I finally bring this to you all now is I was hoping for *something* from them. A message, a notification of some sort, but I've gotten nothing. Someone who meant everything has left me behind and all I feel is the empty place in my soul I made for them, aching for a return I know won't happen.

So, G, if you ever read this, figure out its Me, sincerely: fuck you. You took the last bit of trust I had in people and shattered it because you wanted a project to fix. Me.

(reading this back now, my god do I rant... eugh, I need to go back to therapy...)

  
Edit: I realize I forgot to mention, I had said goodbye to many of my friends the night I tried taking my own life. I told G that I'm deeply sorry if I did anything to anger them, and they'll always be a great friend of mine. I got no response from the 4 other people I texted goodbyes to.",3,1764399210.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False
1p9i8im,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1p9i8im/falling_out_with_my_bff/,Falling out with my BFF,"A bit of a long story -

My very best friend (35F) from the summer going into college (around 15+ years ago) was my ride or die. We would go to concerts together, pick classes together, tell each other everything, traveled abroad together, etc. She was in my wedding and did a lot for my wedding too (a lot was DIY). We picked out really thoughtful presents for each other since we know each other like the back of our hands.

My last job was part time since I’m having health issues and can’t work FT anymore. She was working this job with me and even though it was grueling work, it was better because she was in it with me. We would go out to eat together sometimes after our shifts. We both quit together when it got too much and the pay wasn’t that great to begin with. During this time, my spouse got a new job and a big pay increase. They told me that I didn’t need to force myself to work a job while going through my health issues and we were ok with money for me to do so. (This was about almost 3 years ago, for reference)

This is when my friend changed.

She offered to help me clean my house while I was on bedrest from surgery. We did pay her and when we got food delivered for dinner, we would order her something too. It was fine at first until she snapped and said I needed to be helping and that I could fold clothes in bed. I got really upset with her. I was on literal bedrest and we were paying her to help with these tasks. We decided to not continue that since I realized I was “mixing business & pleasure.”

I went out to dinner with her when I was feeling better and she asked what I was doing for my birthday. I told her about the restaurant that took months to get in and my spouse surprised me with it since I was depressed about my health. She opened her phone and made a reservation at the bar with the restaurant in a couple days. She said “well, I got in, I’ll let you know how it is.”

She ended up going with different friends and posted all about it. When she was telling me about it, she said she treated herself and ordered a lot of things. I felt kind of awkward because the last couple of times we went out, she said she couldn’t pay. I covered for her. She didn’t even offer to pay me back but that was kind of our friendship - I’ll get this coffee, you get the next one kinda thing.

So I got upset that she magically had money for the other outings she had? I gave her the benefit of the doubt - I wasn’t there so idk what happened. But I was hurt, it felt like she was rubbing it in my face that she got to go first but maybe she was jealous I was going? But she did ask…

So fast forward a couple months and we are at a Christmas tea that I booked and confirmed with her. We were going to do the gift exchange too. She texts me and tells me she’s running late. She shows up nearly an hour late and leaving me hanging because I can’t start the tea without her. When it comes to payment, she said she left her wallet at home. She smiled and said “I think it should be you guys gift to me for Christmas.” (Even though I bought her a present). I put my foot down and said no. She tells the waitress when I’m in the bathroom that I’m paying. I say no. She puts her hands up and says “well I don’t even have my wallet,” like it was planned. I was really upset and just paid.

I told her I needed to be alone and I drove to a coffee place 20ish minutes away. She followed me. I ordered a drink and I said she could stay but she’s paying her way (she said she went home to get her wallet since the coffee shop was near her house). I had a gift card that I’ve been wanting to use so I got a snack as well to finish the gift card. I shared the snack since it was a bigger thing than I thought. I go to the bathroom and come back. I noticed my phone wasn’t on the table and asked if she saw it. It was in my purse because she put it there. I thought nothing of it until I went to go pay with my gift card. She said she paid the bill with it - for her items too. At this point, I feel like I’m being used. I tell her she needs to handle tip then. She wouldn’t.

I throw her gift at her and say I’m going home (about a 40 min drive). She said, “wait, your gift is in the car.” She gives me my gift, which she had taken half of “to try.” Mine was a really thought out gift like usual. I tried to not be upset. Like she could have told me no gift or smaller gifts if she couldn’t afford one. But then she said she spent over $200 at the restaurant with the other friends. I told her I was upset about the day and left.

Note - during this time before the day of the tea - 

1.	⁠I also learned that she still texts my mom stuff about me even though I’ve went no contact with my mom and blocked my mom from all social media. I’m not sure WHAT she texts her. But it makes me uncomfortable and she tried to talk me into reconciling with my mom. My mom’s business was our first job together so it’s not really weird that she has her number.

2.	⁠I used to send her voice memos when I was too tired to text. It would be deep stuff like what I talked about in therapy, doctors appts, etc. I learned she was playing them to her mom (who is a nurse) and they would sit there and try to diagnose/help me. I know it was probably in best intentions, but it still irked me that my private stuff was being aired without my permission (I learned about this because she told me) 

So, I did stop talking to her & hanging out with her after this incident. She reached out once and said “it there’s anything I did to make you upset, that wasn’t my intention” - I left her on read because I told her VERY CLEARLY in person.

We haven’t talked or seen each other almost 3 years. I still miss her. Things remind me of her but she has other friends. I think maybe I wasn’t her best friend? Or if I was too much?

This year -

She posted on Facebook she got my dream job (she knows this) and didn’t even give me a heads up. I even wrote a reference letter for her years ago that she used to get it. I was crushed. I didn’t even want to say congrats but I did.

My grandpa passed away a couple months ago. She texted me. I got excited that I could have her back in my life. Turns out, my mom wasn’t going to the funeral and she asked her what kind of things they did. After I told her, she just abruptly stopped texting me again.

That was in July.

It’s in a weird spot and I feel like i let go of a good friend. But maybe she wasn’t.

Am I the AH for letting go of this friendship? Or was she the AH during it?

1p9i7zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1p9i7zv/why_does_gemini_keep_wanting_us_to_stare_at_the/,Why does Gemini keep wanting us to stare at the screen? The nonsense of the chat being deleted when you leave before the response finishes,"Hi everyone,
I've been using Gemini for a while, but recently, especially with the heavier models like Gemini 3, I've noticed a really frustrating issue regarding how it handles connectivity and active sessions.
The Problem:
When I give Gemini a complex prompt (especially on models that take a while to think/generate), I naturally want to switch contexts. For example, I might start the prompt on my PC and then grab my phone to check the result on the go, or simply lock my phone screen while waiting.
The Result:
The moment I disconnect, close the tab, or switch devices, Gemini aborts the generation and often deletes the entire chat.
It feels like the generation process is heavily dependent on the client-side connection. If the ""heartbeat"" with the browser/app stops, Google just kills the process immediately instead of letting it finish in the background.
The Comparison with ChatGPT:
This is a stark contrast to ChatGPT (especially with o1 or Deep Research modes).
 * ChatGPT: I can start a task that takes 20 minutes, close the app, go make a coffee, switch devices, and the process continues running server-side. It doesn't care if I'm watching or not.
 * Gemini: It basically demands that I stare at the screen. If I look away (disconnect), it punishes me by wiping the session.
Is this a technical limitation of how Google streams the tokens, or just a bad UX choice to save compute power? It makes using the ""heavier/slower"" models really impractical if I can't multitask.
Does anyone else experience this, or is it just me?",2,1764399064.0,Bard,1,1.0,False

***This post was too long to include the interrogatories, so that will be the next post!***

[**Exhibit 3 - 2025.09.26 J. Abel Deposition Transcript Vol. II Excerpts** ](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.634304/gov.uscourts.nysd.634304.874.3_1.pdf)

* The document is a **“Joint Pretrial Order”** for the case.
* It lists the involved parties: the plaintiff and the consolidated defendants (including Wayfarer Studios, Justin Baldoni, Jamey Heath, The Agency Group PR, etc.).
* The order outlines **general matters for trial preparation** — including statements of claims, defenses, issues to be tried, and scheduling deadlines.
* It defines **which causes of action and defenses remain at issue** and what the record for trial will consist of.
* It confirms that some exhibits or materials previously subject to sealing or confidentiality motions remain restricted (sealed or redacted) — indicating there are portions of the record not publicly accessible.
* The order also sets the **framework and boundaries** for what evidence, witnesses, and arguments will be allowed at trial.  

[**Exhibit 5 - 2025.10.03 S. Sarowitz Deposition Transcript Excerpts**](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.634304/gov.uscourts.nysd.634304.874.5.pdf)

* This is the video-recorded deposition of Steve Sarowitz, taken October 3, 2025.
* Sarowitz is questioned about message-retention policies and his use of Signal.
* He says he is not aware of any retention policy for messages.
* He confirms he has never adjusted auto-delete settings in his Signal app.
* He states he does not know whether any of his Signal chats related to the film have auto-delete enabled or not.
* He confirms no one has ever taken his phone to adjust auto-delete settings.
* After learning litigation was possible, he took no steps to adjust or check retention settings for his [4sbay.com](http://4sbay.com) email account.
* He does not know the default retention settings for his email system.
* He also does not know the default settings in Signal for deletion or retention.
* When asked whether he took any steps at all to determine whether his messages were being deleted, he repeatedly answers No.
* He confirms he is not aware of doing anything to verify whether Signal messages were being deleted.
* He is asked whether he personally reviewed any documents produced in the litigation (independent of attorney review).
* The last portion shows an objection from counsel, and the answer to that question is still pending at the end of the excerpt.  **Why This Is Relevant** Sarowitz’s testimony shows he took no actions to preserve or even check whether his Signal or email messages were being saved during a period when litigation was anticipated. His lack of knowledge about default settings, combined with his failure to verify retention, supports broader concerns about spoliation, missing communications, and inadequate preservation efforts among the defendants.

* The document is the video-recorded deposition of Justin Baldoni, taken October 6, 2025.
* Baldoni is asked about his use of the encrypted messaging app Signal.
* He testifies that although he had downloaded Signal earlier (possibly as far back as 2020) at the suggestion of a colleague, he says he and the group never used it — “we never communicated on Signal.”
* He explains that his phone “gets rid of” apps if they’re not used, and that the prior Signal installation was never active.
* He says he re-downloaded Signal only a day or two after a major media article and lawsuit disclosure, as part of a group decision to move all chats to Signal.
* According to him, that group decision included his attorneys and key individuals: including the publicist, PR executives, and other defendants.
* He confirms the group included persons such as a publicist, PR team, and possibly other executives — though he notes one (Steve Sarowitz) “joined eventually, yes” rather than immediately.

* This is Volume II of the video-recorded deposition of Justin Baldoni, taken October 7, 2025.
* Baldoni testifies that an investor has put in over $100 million, which he says is “nowhere near the amount of profit” made on It Ends With Us.
* He states he has not taken, and will not take, any share of that profit.
* When asked whether there is any documentation memorializing that he will not take a profit share, he answers: “I don’t believe so.”
* He agrees there would be documentation showing any payments he has received from the film.
* He says his lawyers have whatever documents would need to be produced, and assumes they would produce them if required.
* He is asked about his interrogatory response stating he first anticipated litigation related to It Ends With Us in August 2024; he does not recall but assumes it is accurate.
* He states that after that time, he did not understand he was required to preserve all documents relating to anticipated litigation.
* When asked when he first understood he had a preservation obligation, he answers: “I believe this last week.”
* He confirms that “this last week” (the week of the deposition in October 2025) was the first time he understood a formal duty to preserve documents.
* He then claims he nonetheless “preserve\[d\] them anyway” starting in August 2024 by “not deleting anything.”
* He is questioned about whether his email accounts have retention policies; he initially does not understand the term.
* After counsel explains that “retention” means whether emails stay or get deleted automatically after some time, he begins to answer but the excerpt cuts off before he finishes explaining his settings.

[**Exhibit 8 - 2025.10.08 J. Heath Deposition Transcript Vol. I Excerpts**](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.634304/gov.uscourts.nysd.634304.874.8_1.pdf)

* This is the video-recorded deposition of Jamey Heath, taken October 8, 2025.
* On June 17, 2024, Heath asked Mitz Toskovic via text to create a timeline document summarizing key events related to the film’s production.
* He directed Toskovic to include events such as meetings between Justin and Blake, filming dates, private conversations at Blake’s home, discussions about weight, interactions with the trainer, and the receipt of a letter from Blake.
* He requested “anything that tells the story chronologically.”
* Heath says the timeline was meant to capture their overall experience across the previous year and a half.
* He acknowledges his text instructions focus specifically on events involving Blake Lively.
* He was aware of most of these events before June 17, 2024.
* He cannot recall what he meant by the phrase “alleged incident” and does not remember clarifying that term.
* Heath and Toskovic both contributed information to the timeline, though he cannot quantify his own contributions.
* He does not recall making revisions to the timeline after August 6, 2024.
* The timeline was sent to The Agency Group (TAG) to give them an overview of the events described.
* Heath confirms their team had retained TAG for crisis-management support during that time.
* He describes his communication with consultant Jed Wallace as mostly supportive personal check-ins.
* A text from August 11, 2024 shows Heath saying he is not on Signal yet but will set it up that week.
* He believes he set up Signal shortly after and may have exchanged messages with Wallace.
* He believes there may have been a group chat including Wallace, Abel, and Nathan, but does not recall whether it was on Signal or regular text.
* When asked whether he communicated on Signal with various individuals between August and November 2024, he consistently says he may have but does not recall specifics.
* He does not know whether any Signal messages from August through December 2024 still exist.
* He did not investigate Wayfarer’s retention policies and only learned of preservation obligations after receiving formal notice, such as a complaint or cease-and-desist.
* After that notice, he checked his Signal settings to ensure auto-delete was off and instructed Wayfarer personnel not to delete anything.
* He confirmed the threads still existed at that time but did not review the content of the messages, only the settings.

* This is a video-recorded deposition of Jamey Heath, taken October 9, 2025.
* Heath begins by noting he offered a correction to his prior day’s testimony.
* His correction concerns his earlier statements about the 17-point list that was discussed in the case.
* He explains that in his original testimony, he may have given the impression that he did not consider whether items on the 17-point list could have been connected to past incidents or past concerns raised.
* He clarifies that while he viewed the items on the list as generally reasonable, he later realized he should have acknowledged that some of them might have had “a nod” to issues that had come up previously.
* When asked to clarify what he meant by “a nod,” he says it could mean a reference, an implication, or a suggestion that the item might relate to something that had been discussed before.
* He confirms the “nod” refers to concerns Blake Lively may have brought up in the past.
* Heath says he didn’t definitively conclude the 17-point list was connected to those incidents, but the possibility crossed his mind and he wanted his testimony to accurately reflect that.
* When asked why he wanted to correct the record, he says he wanted to ensure he was being accurate and truthful, and that the thought had stayed with him overnight.
* He is asked whether there is anything else from his prior testimony he wants to correct; he answers no.
* He is then asked whether, during a long breakout-room meeting the night before with his lawyers, other defendants, and family members, he discussed the substance of his testimony.
* Heath says he does not believe he discussed his testimony during that time.

I used to sleep with a Coleman blanket while it was 30 degrees and it was fine even with a fan pulling in outside air. If it gets much colder than that or you need more warmth besides obviously layering clothing, blankets, and sleeping bags, you could use hand warmers.

Electric or regular hand warmers like hot hands can be very helpful on extra cold nights. One week might be colder than the next so this could be the different between you sleeping or you shivering through the night waiting for the stores to open. I feel like electric hand warmers could be really handy for people that can keep them charged. Then you don’t have to keep buying hand warmers. 

Free hot water at cafes. You can usually score free hot water at a cafe in a variety of places such as: grocery stores with a cafe(Starbucks or coffee shop), gas stations, libraries, hospitals, airports, etc. if you keep your eyes peeled you can usually score some free hot water to make your instant soup or coffee/tea, or just to sip and get warm. Chicken bouillon in a cup is real real nice especially when you’re cold.

Bangalore’s weather is finally behaving  not melting us, not drowning us, just existing peacefully like a well-adjusted adult. And with the Cubbon Park Flower Show blooming for the next 2 weeks, I figured, maybe this is the universe nudging me to stop scrolling reels and start meeting real humans (wild idea, I know).

So here I am, tossing another hopeful message into the digital void.

What do I want?
Sure, a million dollars would be amazing but since RBI has trust issues with me, I’d settle for someone who wants to stroll through Cubbon Park, admire flowers that look too pretty to be real, debate which one’s the best, and maybe grab coffee after while I bore you with geeky topics like constellations, sci-fi books, or why The Imitation Game is brilliant.

If this monologue didn’t scare you off, ChatGPT deserves credit for helping Bangaloreans find love in 2025. 😌

1p9hz39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p9hz39/the_dance_of_fire_part_6/,The Dance of Fire - Part 6,"The bridge of the Prowler was silent and dimly lit enough that anyone would have been excused for thinking that it was mostly deserted, and the night crew was asleep. While they most certainly wished they had been at this point, the small, blinking light that signaled incoming ships had the attention of the current acting commander.

The console fully lit up at their touch, the sensors feeding the data coming to the screen told of the composition of the approaching flotilla. Multiple transports, one particularly large one in the middle, escorted by what looked like a swarm of corvettes, a single frigate, and a destroyer, the latter being the largest actual warship that could be detected.

""Wake the Captain! It\`s them!"" He sent the substitute weapons officer, after checking their own status, to make sure they remained hidden. But the currents of hyperspace were as expected, which should have further limited their already minimal profile. As far as the crew was aware, the GTU did not possess the sophisticated hyperspace detection methods needed to spot them here, but you never knew with the humans. You did not want to be there when they just so happened to send along a dedicated science vessel with their latest experimental tech.

Ralga came in with enough momentum that he had to grab his seat to be able to stop himself from slamming into his own command console. ""What do we have?""

""Looks like a convoy instead of a strike force. But with a sizable escort, and some of the haulers are known combat transport variants. Not the big sucker in the middle, according to the database, however. Could be a supply run for their outpost, or an evacuation force?""

""Doubtful, and highly unlikely."" The Captain responded to both suggestions before looking at the sensor data himself. Unfortunately for him, the targets were now at an angle where the composition of their force could no longer be detected. And taking the hyperdrive out of its low run mode to reposition themselves would have risked detection right now.

The other members of the main bridge crew were turning up now. There were silent salutes, and some noises of tired annoyance as everyone was trying to wake up and take up their posts.

Ralga himself was pondering the meaning of this. Could it have been that this was all that the humans could muster to retake the system? If so, they were most fortunate. ""Relay the info to Soltar as soon as it is safe to send a message. Seems like the humans are sending him more targets to play with."" But then he paused. He could not see what these were right now. And the Nav Officer holding the bridge mentioned a larger transport.

""What kind of Transport was the large one again? Send over the record of the detection!""

""Database said it was an Ardennes-class heavy cargo hauler. And already done, Captain!""

He acknowledged with a nod and looked at the snapshot the acting commander got before he arrived. He froze as he saw it. The silhouette of that thing was a bit too familiar for comfort.

They were speeding towards the Imperial Palace right now. Masil had to resist the urge to stick his head out the window of this hovercraft. There were enough instances of him getting mistaken for a pet already. Not that it was really that far off, he mused. And at the same time, he found himself not really minding it anymore. As long as it was with Kaba. That she made it clear that she valued his thoughts as much as just his presence, and let him set boundaries in some things, helped a lot. He really had a hard time putting into words what this relationship looked like, even more than he would have had to explain sauromantian architecture. But it did not look like they were going to see the Palace up close, as they were turning away into a green area. Green and blue-ish, considering some of the plants growing on Venifee. First, he thought these were some kind of farms, but the aesthetic choices made it clear that these were gardens. Multiple plots of neatly arranged, decorative trees, bushes, and flower patches that would have fed entire villages at home if used for food production instead. To think that her Aunt\`s botanical garden, opened for the public to be able to see plant life of alien worlds at home, was considered an overly extravagant waste of money and water. Then again, considering the humidity and those clouds, water was probably not an issue for this planet, he reminded himself. By the looks of everything else, money wasn\`t either. Well, not for their emperor, that is.

""We are here. I don\`t have to remind you to behave, I think."" Kaba gave a knowing look to him as she got out of the speeder.

""Yeah, I would rather not lose my head."" He made a gesture of cutting his own throat as he got out behind her.

""This way!"" The guards escorted them to one of the plots that looked a bit more natural than the rest. The even, almost identical bushes from before were less uniform here. Still tastefully arranged, however. Their escorts simply left, leaving them alone, with a gardener who was ankle deep in the soil for some of the plants right now.

""Your Majesty?"" Kaba spoke and bowed.

Masil spun around, confused. Nobody was around except the gardener. Then it hit him. Seeing the Emperor in a straw hat, with an apron, was not how he imagined this would go.

""Lord Commander Pazazzi! And the kitusi prince. I heard a lot about you. Excuse the reception, I was informed of an infestation, and could not help but come to the aid of my children. My father always put an emphasis on needing a hobby besides politics, or you would go insane. One of the few things from him that I have to agree with. And, minor things can sometimes teach a thing or two for one\`s main calling.""

Was this even the same person? They did not refer to themselves in the plural anymore, and they seemed far more collected. But Masil's recognition of sauromantians was not that bad. The clothes and the behavior changed, but it was the same scars, voice, and everything. Maybe it was gardening where they calmed down, or was that whole thing earlier, just an act?

""For decisions about agriculture?"" Kaba risked a question. She seemed a bit baffled herself, so likely she did not expect this shift either.

""Not really, a bit of hobby gardening hardly makes you an expert on that. You see, these days it\`s all genetically engineered crops, hydroponics, and growth accelerants. And even those are for luxuries, really, most of our subjects eat chemically reprocessed waste from a biogenerator. Not that you could tell the difference from an actually grown fruit, or if the meat came from a real animal, if it's the expensive version, of course.  Here? I learned that the trick to healthy, proper plants is not to force the issue, but to provide a suitable enough environment and just let them grow at their own pace."" He pulled a small, white grub from the soil and threw it into a bucket full of the wiggling little things. ""Of course, that does not mean allowing pests to destroy it. Letting nature take its course is for wildlife preserves, not gardens."" He stood up, pulling off the dirty gloves. ""Come, walk with me!""

Masil planned to just follow them in silence, as agreed. Not open his mouth about why he was not just using pesticides right now, for example.  But Harkanis, apparent part-time gardener and emperor, would not have it.

""Such a curious little thing. I would think him mute if I did not know better. How was your trip? Is our home to your liking, Prince Masil?""

The kitusi instantly pulled back his ears in panic and tucked his tail between his legs. The one exception to the no speaking rule was if he was addressed, but he did not exactly plan for this eventuality, especially after most other sauromantians either ignored him or treated him like a non-sapient pet. ""It is, big your Majesty. I mean, very impressive. And, not in a million years would I have thought to ever get to see it, before I was wed to the Lord Commander."" He tried to make himself as small as possible, never mind how unnecessary that seemed.

""Aw, are you afraid, little one? Don\`t be, I won't bite your head off. There are no expectations of you. You could probably not even do anything that would get you punished by me in any way. Well, maybe if you tried to dig up my flowers. Don\`t do that if you wish to keep your tail."" He let out a hiss that Masil could already identify as the equivalent of laughter. Before he turned to Kaba.

""I am saddened to see that one of my more capable subjects decided to forgo continuing their bloodline, but I can see the appeal. What I have a much harder time accepting is your refusal to join my invisible hand. I could really use capable officers in the right places."" He let it hang.

She did not hesitate to kick that ball back. ""I had the impression I was already serving you where I could do so at my best, my Lord? Also, I was too busy trying to secure our border. To speak nothing of my doubts about those who claimed to be your agents being truly what they proposed to be.""

Masil was just listening and trying to meld into the background without making it too obvious again. There was clearly some history here that he was not aware of.

""But would you consider joining, now that I made it clear that they are indeed mine?""

""To what end, your Majesty? You can already order me as you please.""

""Maybe! But orders can be carried out because one wants to, and for fear of consequences. I do not wish to pressure you. If I wanted compliance supported by nothing but self-interest and dread, I would keep relying on the Shadowguard. I need capable people in places who are willing to do more than what their office tells them to."" Seeing the grimace on Kabas's visage, he added. ""And also those who willingly follow my vision for our future!"" He started walking into what looked like a hedge labyrinth. ""But I guess you need a glimpse of that vision first. Come, walk with me. Bring the Prince. This concerns him as well. In fact, I might value his insights, or at least his experience of his people with the same plight.""

They both followed him, looking at each other for a few seconds. The realization hit Masil. That Kaba would look for him for comfort and stability in this moment was all kinds of terrifying but oddly sweet at the same time. The Emperor was ranting on.

""My grandfather was a ruthless tyrant who had no restraint when it came to enforcing his will and accumulating power in his hands alone. In the end, being surrounded by bootlickers and fear made him blind, and it nearly cost us everything. Then the power vacuum left in his wake, almost broke the Empire a second time. My father took the lesson from that too far, was too thrusting, and made the mistake of giving it all away to self-serving nobles, as well as trying to empower people who have no clue how to govern themselves, let alone rule an interstellar empire. After the short-lived reigns of my brothers, may both of them be forgiven in their final rest, I was left to pick up this mess. And it could not be properly sorted out to this day.""

The bridge crew of the Fenris were full of energy, like a compressed spring ready to let go. Carrying out their orders with the kind of enthusiasm you really only get with those fresh out of the Academy. Their Captain was the only one not sharing their mood, and he almost envied them. If only he could be carried away like that right now. He knew exactly what awaited them and how long it would take.

The blue-cyan hellscape of a collective seizure that was hyperspace was replaced with the night sky of Aviss 6. The outer gas giant was the safe bet for a jump into the system. It was also pretty far out from its primary, and its orbit left it at the other end of this star system right now. Meaning, it would take hours even on full sublight to reach anything from here. All that energy his crew had after their morning coffee? It would have to last for quite a bit before they saw real action.

Unsurprisingly, what greeted them was a whole lot of nothing. If they were tourists here for sightseeing, they could have taken a closer look at the gas giant itself. They might have admired the atmosphere with its colorful spots that were storms, some of them larger than some planets. A prospector might have been interested in the moons and their metallic deposits, which were nothing special, but would have been somewhat valuable if anyone ever decided to build up local infrastructure in this system. For a military operation? The sensors made it clear that there was nothing of interest around this large chunk of gas and its icy companions.

The task force formed up around the Jutland and jumped as soon as their hyperdrives were ready again. Heading for the fourth planet on an indirect vector. The flight plan had multiple, seemingly random alterations in the middle of it that slowed down their approach.  At least Rolf could be sure that Vice Admiral Holzer had read his and the courier\`s reports, and was wary of mine fields. He made precautions with their approach vector, even if mines rarely posed a threat to something travelling at sublight. Not without something else making you drop out of it. Somehow, these marauders still managed to take out most of the outpost\`s patrol ships, with some mines before.

\-x-

It took an hour of looking at long-range sensor readings and minor flight adjustments before there was something else on the scopes. A distress signal, and multiple dots on the sensor screens indicating a pursuit away from Saarsis.

""What do we got?"" Rolf sat up, straightening his pose in his seat.

""Repeating SOS, only simple code identifying the ship with its serial number. Looks like it is running from a couple of raiders following it.""

The Captain of the Fenris frowned. Did the pirates think that he or his superiors would be that stupid? Some straggler, being hunted down just as the response arrives in the system? Yeah, sure.

""Message from the Jutland!"" Came the report from communications.

""On screen!"" He did not expect much besides orders to ignore the obvious bait or distraction. And sure enough, the stone-faced Vice Admiral appeared on their main display.

""Attention all units! Delta squad is to break off and go after these signals to investigate. Everyone else, keep heading towards the planet! Holzer out!""

""What? Is he serious?"" Rolf jumped up. ""He has to know how this looks. Even if he believed that the timing was a coincidence. He got my reports! They were jamming the whole system before, all the time, and now that we arrive, it just happens to be quiet to allow that distress signal?""

""Regulation says we would have to respond to distress signals. Or perhaps he is just not willing to risk the off chance that it is someone actually in trouble?"" Matt interjected.

Rolf felt an ounce of shame at the suggestion of his First Officer. Not long ago, he would have been the one to say that they could not take the chance. This still looked like an obvious trap, and to split their forces? The worst response he could think of.

""Open a channel to the Jutland, I need to talk to him!""

We have always had a great sex life and we are honestly obsessed with each other. One thing to note is that I am not a slim girl. I would say I am medium, a little chubby, but my husband has always said it never bothered him or changed how he saw me.

We have been trying for a baby this year, and it has taken a huge emotional toll on both of us. I have PCOS, but I have still been able to get pregnant. We lost our daughter at 14 weeks, and then we had two more miscarriages after that. Losing our daughter shattered us both in ways I cannot describe. It has been one of the hardest things we have ever lived through. As we didn’t expect to get pregnant on our first try.Through all of this, my husband has been an amazing support system. I truly cannot say he does not love me because he has always shown me that he does.

When we were dating, we talked about things we did not like in partners. He told me he does not like someone who smokes, drinks, or lies. I told him that lying and following random women is something I cannot accept because it is a red flag for me. I stopped everything he didn’t like he is also very against caffeine and I absolutely love coffee i stopped drinking coffee and followed what ever he said so did he expect clearly this whole thing. (I guess he never figured he was going to get caught)

A few months into our marriage, I noticed he was following a lot of models on social media. It hurt me, and I told him that I did not like it. After a few arguments, he kept saying that it was normal and that the men at his workplace always talk about how once you are married your wife will not want you and you would have to resort to porn. This was confusing for me because that has never been the case with us. We have a healthy sex life and I have never denied him. After that, he unfollowed them just like he promised.

But later on, I noticed he was still viewing the same type of content, even if he was not following anyone. It broke me in a quiet way. It made me question if he still found me attractive because those women looked nothing like me. It crushed my confidence. He reassured me again and I ended up doing weight loss surgery, partly for my health, but also to feel better about myself. I truly believed things were okay and that he had stopped completely.

We recently had another miscarriage 3 weeks ago. We were told not to have sexual activity for 4 weeks, but I still made sure his needs were met in other ways even though mine were not being met at all. I had a strange dream about him cheating on me and I could not shake the feeling afterwards. We have never had issues checking each other’s phones, so when I checked his, his Instagram explore page was filled with really inappropriate content. Seeing that crushed me. I had already expressed how much it hurts me, and I am already grieving the loss of our third baby. It made me feel like I was not enough during a time when I am already feeling so broken.

I went into another room and locked myself inside because I did not know how to process the hurt. He keeps telling me it is nothing like that, that he watches porn as a coping mechanism when he is sad, and that it is only about the act and not the women themselves.

I am trying to understand it all, but I am hurting so much. I would really like some advice. What would you do if you were in my situation?",0,1764398088.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

Created a decor sub-team and disbursed their own resources, only to ask for an update 3 weeks to the day, and you are giving excuses. Why would anyone order giant paper flowers off Alibaba? I mean, really. These things are basically oversized tissue paper with dreams, one wrong fold and they’re history. The idea of them surviving a three-week voyage in a cardboard box feels... optimistic. Maybe they’ll arrive looking like majestic roses. Or maybe they’ll look like a deflated party. Fine, I understand that you wanted to save a ton and still have the best outcome, but there are other decorative materials you should have gone for, really. Personally, I’d rather buy the materials from a local craft store and figure out the mess in my garage. At least that way, if things go south, I know who to blame… me. Sure, ordering pre-made ones might save you a few hours, but the suspense of waiting to see whether you’ll get flowers or confetti, or whether they will arrive in good shape and on time for your wedding, isn’t worth it.

Anyone else noticing their posture slowly morphing into a question mark since leaving the daily grind? 🙋‍♀️ I swear, I used to stand taller! Now it's all cozy couch time and gardening hunches. But let's be real, feeling slumped isn't just about aesthetics. It's about energy, mood, and overall…well, living it up!

So, I wanted to share a super simple thing I've been doing that's been making a HUGE difference: re-engaging my core! I know, I know, core work sounds like hours at the gym. But trust me, this is like, a *five-minute* thing you can do while waiting for your coffee to brew.

Think of your core as the foundation for *everything*. A strong foundation means better posture, less back pain, and even more energy to chase those grandkids around (or finally start that woodworking project!).

Here’s the quick and dirty:

*   **Standing Tall Starts Small:** Imagine a string pulling you up from the crown of your head. Gently tuck your chin and pull your shoulder blades slightly back and down. Hold for a few breaths. You’re already doing it!

*   **The Gentle Squeeze:** Consciously engage your core muscles. Think of it like you're bracing yourself for a light punch in the stomach. Don't suck in; just a gentle, firm squeeze. Hold for a few seconds, release, and repeat.

*   **Pelvic Tilts (Subtly!):** Standing or sitting, gently rock your pelvis forward and back. Tiny movements! You're trying to find that sweet spot where your spine feels most neutral. This helps release tension in your lower back.

*   **Breathing is Key:** Remember to BREATHE! Deep, diaphragmatic breaths help engage your core even further. Inhale deeply into your belly, exhale slowly, feeling your core muscles gently contract.

*   **Consistency is Queen (or King!):** Even just a few minutes a day makes a world of difference. Set a reminder on your phone! I usually do it while I'm waiting for water to boil.

Honestly, it's amazing how much better I feel after just a few days of doing this. More energy, less back stiffness, and I swear, even my mood has improved! Feeling motivated? **We believe in strongest people.** Check out this link for a free guide with more tips and exercises that compliment this routine.

—-Script Start

(speaker yawning) mm? Strange, this isn’t my bed.

\[rope tugging\]

(calm) Ropes around my legs and hands, holding me down in a chair. Cliche, but effective. (calls out) You there, in the shadows watching me, I assume you're responsible for tying me up?

…

Well at least you admit it, but the least you could do is step out of the shadows. You abducted me, I think seeing what you look like is a fair request. 

… 

No, I’m not particularly scared, but you seem to be; hiding back there. You have me tied up, why should you be afraid? 

… \[heavy footsteps\] <the speaker is now standing in front of the tied up listener>

(assured, confident) Ah yes, I recognize you now. Normally we’d be meeting at the checkout lane, having a quick chat before you run off like a shy little lamb. I’ll admit, I didn’t think you were capable of abducting me. Still, nice to see you again outside of work, even if I have some issues with the ambiance.

…

(chuckles, teasing) Deny it all you want, your face is all red. You're stumbling over your words now, just like you do whenever we spoke at check out. Plus, you didn’t bother hiding your face, or are you gonna say it’s some kind of evil twin situation? 

…

(amused) I’m still not scared, because I know you won’t lay a finger on me. I remember being asleep in bed, before waking up here. You took the time to safely capture me, and I am uninjured. If you actually wanted to hurt me, you would’ve done so already. 

…

(laughs) Threats tend to work better when you aren’t stammering, just a bit of advice. To be honest, it sounds adorable when you talk like that. 

…

(calm) I’m not trapped in a strange place, I know exactly where I am. Tied up, in a basement, by you. I may not know the details beyond that, but I know where I am specifically at this moment, and that’s what matters most, according to my coven.

(quoting)  Rule 32 of the Witches guide, ‘A Witch’s most powerful tool is her confidence. Know yourself and where you stand, everything else becomes as natural as breathing’. 

…

(nonchalant) Oh yes, a witch’s coven. Mine is rather small, but my sisters are all very wise. I’ve learned so much from them over the years. 

…

(amused) Ah, your eyes bulging in shock is honestly even more adorable than your stammering. But yes, I am a witch, in the flesh. I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out before, given you were  stalking me.

…

(scoffs) Please, you were clearly visiting the store every week to see me. And you were able to get into my house and carry me away, you had to have been watching me for a while to do that. My pet cat and broomstick collection didn’t set off any alarm bells? Or the giant cauldron I keep in the kitchen?

…

(chuckles) I think the cauldron is a bit much for ‘home decor’, little stalker. 

…

(Blunt) No, I won’t be doing a demonstration of my magic for you. 

…

(Calm) Because it’s not needed, frankly. I can tell by the look in your eyes, you believe me already. Furthermore, magic is dangerous, that’s one of the first things you learn in a Witch’s coven. We aren’t Warlocks, haphazardly slinging spells to try and turn sheep blue, only to blow ourselves up in the process. 

…

(Amused) Even so, that changes nothing about our situation. I know I don’t need to use a single spell to escape, nor do I want to escape.

… 

(Sigh) Because I want to ask, was kidnapping me really easier than just asking me out for coffee?

…

(laughs) there’s that red face of yours again. You know, you're lucky I’ve gotten used to translating your stammering through our talks at the store. So you say you want to charge my parents for a ransom? I call bullshit. 

(continued) I remember mentioning before, my relationship with my parents wasn’t great right now. And If you like me enough to stalk me, you would have remembered that. So it’s cute that you're making shit up to hide your feelings, but it won’t work.

(slightly annoyed) Is admitting you have a crush on me really that difficult? I may be a witch, but I didn’t think I was that scary. (sincere, but joking) I promise, I wouldn’t turn you into a toad or anything, just for asking me out.

…

(sigh) If I wasn’t interested, I would’ve said no, and things would’ve been awkward for a little while, but we’d both move on eventually. You can’t force someone to say yes to a date, I think you know that deep down. You just need to try, and accept whatever happens.

… 

(calm) Maybe you kidnapped me out of fear, but I can tell by the lack of conviction in your voice, you know this wasn’t right. Threatening me and abducting me, really isn’t going to make me love you. 

Oh sure, maybe if it was someone with less confidence, and afraid for their life. Maybe, (emphasized) maybe they would agree to ‘love’ you for the sake of survival… But deep down, you and I both know that wouldn’t be real love, right? 

That knowledge would eat away at you, slowly breaking your heart while they’re dying on the inside from fear… It’s not a scenario that ends well for anyone in the long run. (reciting) Witch’s law #42-’you can’t force someone to love you, not with magic or by force.’

…

(empathetic) And I can tell by looking at you, this isn’t something you're proud of. Shot in the dark, you don’t have a lot of experience asking people out, do you?

…

(gentle) Ah, so you never really asked a casual acquaintance out before. That would explain the stammering and fear, but where did you get the idea of kidnapping me from? 

…

(understanding) I know what ASMR roleplay is. My coven sister Kiera listened to a lot of comfort audios when she was suffering from depression. I’m guessing you listened to a lot of Yandere stuff, then?

…

(chuckles) A fun fantasy, but not really something to build a relationship on. Try to remember that in the future, alright? 

…

(confused) Well, I’m not reporting you to the cops or anything like that. I’m uninjured, and this was all clearly just a big misunderstanding caused by your anxiety. Are you gonna kidnap me, or anyone else again? 

 …

(laughs) I can only imagine the amount of prep work you had to put into this. Not to mention the food cost and concealing my abduction from the cops. You’ve got a large set of stress bangles under your eyes. But the work load isn’t the only reason you won’t do it again, right?

(leading the listener) Finish this sentence, ‘I will not kidnap people and force them to love me because-?”

…

(repeating listener) “Because it’s bad, and I regret kidnapping (speaker name)!”

\[Clapping\]

(praising gently) Very good! Now you're getting it, good job! Don’t be embarrassed, just take it on the chin and move on. You learned an important lesson, and took a step towards being a better person. Much better than my last stalker.

…

(casually ominous) Oh yeah, I had another stalker before you. Total raving lunatic, tried to physically grab me, threatening me online, the whole nine yards. I turned them into a fish, currently residing in Headmistress Helena’s aquarium until they learn to behave themselves. 

…

(light laugh/giggle) Aw, your eyes are popping again. Don’t worry, I knew you weren’t that kind of  lunatic. I’ve enjoyed our conversations at the store, and I always saw you going to help people who were struggling, even when you were watching me. You were clearly just shy and insecure, and it unfortunately got out of hand.

(gentle) Sometimes, we make mistakes. I remember back when I started as a witch, I gave my rival at work a skin rash that lasted for two weeks. The headmistress really let me have it after that one, I swear she went on for 3 hours about the importance of restraint and emotional maturity. 

<the speaker scooches the chair forward>


(gentle, but stern) You made a big mistake, had it explained to you, and now you feel bad. That’s just life, screwing up and trying to do better. In fact, do you mind untying me? 

\[gentle unbinding/unraveling of ropes\]

(chuckle) Good boy/girl, thank you. Although judging by that look in your eye, it seems like you still have something on your mind.

…

(gentle) Valid concern, some people do only change because someone else holds power over them. It’s possible you're only listening to me, because I could overpower you if I wanted. But the thing is, you chose to listen. Some people don’t even get that far in the process.

The fact you respected me, regretted this from the start, and let me go, while agreeing not to do it again? That tells me what kind of person you are deep down. A human, flawed, but only needing a gentle scolding to change. And I really do think you're a good person, just driven to do something bad by the fear of loneliness. I know you’ll do better from now on, cause I’ve seen the type of person you can be otherwise, and I like that person, a lot. 

…

(gently) You're welcome, think nothing of it. 

\[awkward silence\]

(breaking awkward silence) Sooooo, what was gonna be your sales pitch?

…

(playful) Your sales pitch! You know-your big love confession, excessive praise and worship, meant to make me believe we were ‘soulmates destined to be together’. Telling me how wonderful and perfect I am. The whole song and dance, I wanna hear it.

…

(laugh) Don’t be embarrassed, you had to have had it planned out. So come on, tell me!

… <Longer pause>

(touched) I’ll push back on you saying ‘love’, we don’t know each other that well after all, stalking aside. But thanks, I really do appreciate all the sweet words. I can tell you really meant all of that, from the bottom of that big soft heart of yours. 

…

(laughs) You're welcome, but you aren’t off the hook just yet. I think I have the right to make a request, seeing as you inconvenienced me on my day off.

… \[heavy footsteps as the speaker approaches to intimidate the listener\]

(teasing, start threatening, but end as playful\] For your punishment, you wicked, lowly, naughty human. I want you… to buy me a coffee and a scone.

… 

(loud laugh) Well, yeah! (affectionate) I’d say you won me over with that sappy confession. But the truth is, I’ve liked you for a while, dork. I was just waiting on you to ask me out first, even if you were taking a while. Given the way you kept striking up a conversation with me at the store, I figured that was what you wanted. 

… 

(touched) I’m not particularly traditional about ‘who asks who’ out. I just figured you wanted to do it. But since you are seemingly too shy to ask… Do you wanna go out on a coffee date with me? 

…

(warm, affectionate) Good, we can work on your confidence later. As for when, how about we go right now? It’s still early in the day, so we have plenty of time to get some coffee and chat. Or tea, whichever you prefer. 

…

(gentle, teasing) No need to worry about getting changed. 

\[finger snap, magic sounds, ambiance of people chatting\]

…

(nonchalant, casual) Oh that? Just a quick teleportation and fashion spell. I hope you don’t mind, but I put you in that outfit you wore two weeks ago. I thought it was a really good look for you. 

…

(chuckles) You’ll catch flies if you leave your jaw hanging like that. I told you I was a witch, didn’t I?

…

(laughing) Well, I don’t like to overuse magic, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to give you a small demonstration of what a witch can do, when she puts her mind to it.

(gentle, flirty/teasing) So, shall we then, you cute lil dork? Show me you can show a witch a good time, without the rope.

1p9hqs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p9hqs3/soft/,Soft,"My tail wrapped around the railings of my seat as I pulled myself in. I clicked the buckles into place. Through the viewport, asteroids drifted in dusty, lazy arcs. It was a routine patrol mission. A boring sweep through an asteroid field near the mining belts because some rock-pushers claimed they’d seen “strange signals”. Pirates, maybe. More like an excuse to take a few shifts off. My tail rapped twice on the alloy floors. That didn’t make sense. Ever since the law changed, miners didn’t get paid for “exploration” any more, only for hauling back ore. No rocks, no credits. No point weaselling out of work if you aren’t getting paid for it.

*Whatever. A patrol’s a patrol. At least command was paying us for this one.*

I pulled up my console, watching the fleet drift in formation. Slime collective ships gliding like shimmering beads, wolf-men cruisers bristling. And at the back of the formation, the new one. A weird, spin-y cylinder with sharpened tips. The human ship.

Humans… I still wasn’t sure what to make of them. Primates we were familiar enough with; soft skin, thin fur. Good for climbing trees. But these primates were different. They kept off their usual habitats, going around the ground like the wolf-men. They no-longer had their tails, but were somehow bipedal like us.

Every Alliance species had fossil memories of primates. Clever creatures that used tools, built fires, threw things. They were annoying sometimes, sure, but in all our history, they never amounted to much. Their nails and teeth were never hard enough to pierce our scales, their fur never strong enough to block the wolf-men’s claws. They used tools… which the enemy would pick up and use on them. That’s why pure tool-using species never made it far.

And these humans were worse than the old stories.

I still remember meeting them on the first official exchange, still remembered shaking the hand of one of them. She had bare skin, no scales, no carapace. Bones that snapped from a three-meter fall. They couldn’t even hold their breath long enough for three minutes in vacuum. They used “space suits” when we went out into space, those clunky, brittle bubbles they shoved themselves into and tethered to their ships.

Compared to the other species, these humans were… soft. Not soft like the slimes. Those guys detached their limbs and used them as propellant. They could slip between gaps in ships and pretty much survive anything their hard world threw at them. Fighting them was a pain. They’d slip through gaps, wait their opponent out, then smother them in their sleep.

These humans lost their fangs, their nails, their fur, and even their tails. All in favour of tools. Just tools. Tools your enemies could use against you. I shook my head and focused on the scanners. Then the comms chimed.

“Admiral,” came the human captain’s voice, cheerful as ever. What was she on, her third cup of that poison bean juice they called *coffee'*? “I think we’ve spotted the problem.”

Already? None of our sensors showed a thing. Not even the wolves’ ships, and those had the best sensors the alliance had to offer. The humans bragged their sensors had triple the range, but everyone just assumed it was the primate chest-pounding. Some extra credit to get themselves in the alliance.

“Pirates?” I asked.

“Doesn’t look like it,” the human replied. “Still a ways out, but… we’re guessing fish.”

Fish? What in the nine constellations were fish?

“Threat level?”

“Probably nothing that’ll bother us,” she said casually. “But maybe nasty for the miners.”

“Keep me posted.”

“Aye aye, Admiral.”

That was one of the better traits of the humans. Cooperative. The wolves only ever listened to orders when the orders came from someone who could beat their alpha in a fight. That meant space operations were usually lizard command, and planetary actions meant wolf command. And neither party enjoyed it. The humans were more like the slimes in that sense. They didn’t much mind who was in command. Some in the crew called them slimes with backbones. Which ironically made them worse in fights.

We drifted on. A few minutes later, the chief engineer called. His voice a wet gurgling spoken through resonance organs.

“Sir… we need to run.”

My tail stiffened. Bob wasn’t the type to whine at danger. Among the slimes, he was what people called fool-hardy. “Explain.”

“I got a call from the engineer corps on the human ship. They say it’s a swarm.”

“What?” My scales bristled. “There’s nothing on our sensors. How do they know?”

“They were testing the range on the human’s sensors and pooled together. The entire crew. The collective found them.”

“Are you certain?”

“Yes sir. And… sir, a matriarch.”

The bridge was silent. My crew didn’t even as much as breath. The swarm was here. The apex of space life. An all-consuming unkillable collective. We’d mapped everything beyond charted territory as “No Return”. That’s where they lived. Where *it* lived. A moving biome of predators sculpted by vacuum and time. The wolves tried fighting them, twice in space, once on land. They died every time.

Our fleets tried once. I shuddered at the memory. The entire engaging fleet consumed. Organics, ships, even the asteroids nearby devoured by the swarm. Some xenobiologists theorized that killing a matriarch might kill the swarm, but no fleet could get close to finding it, let alone putting it down. Fighting was pointless. You see the swarm, you run.

At that moment, faint blips or red appeared on our sensors. The human ship hailed again. “Admiral, looks like they’re popping up on our sensors now.”

I swallowed. “Indeed.”

I switched to a fleet-wide channel.

“All ships: contact confirmed. The swarm is here. Evasive manoeuvrers. Run and survive.”

The human’s voice cut in, confused.

“Sir? This is the perfect change for some rare minerals. And food.”

Food? Was she insane? I’d heard parts of the human worlds were in starvation, but against the swarm? No. Maybe her crew was a sacrifice ship. A tube of mouths to be shipped off to die. But the ship was their tool, armed with sensors good enough to rival the wolves. They wouldn’t throw that away.

“Sir!” My navigator cried. “Sir, we need to go.”

I gritted my teeth.

“ALL SHIPS!” I barked. “Flee! Captains have autonomy. Do not. I repeat, do not wait for anyone.”

The alliance scattered. Slime ships streaked off like living torpedoes. They had no care for Gs. The wolves ignited their drives and pulled away. Ships flashed out of sensor range one after another, except for the humans.

“Captain!” I yelled. “What are you doing?!”

“Sir?”

“You have a responsibility to your crew! Go!”

“But Admiral,” she said, “our reinforcements are nearby. They’ve confirmed they’re minutes out.”

“No,” I said. “Impossible.”

My jaws creaked at the confusion in her tone. The nearest wolf fleet was days away. The nearest human fleet was months out. No one was coming to our aid, especially not against the swarm. Before I could say more, they, no, it slid into visual range. A writhing curtain of biosignatures. The humans were already dead, and so were the slimes on board. They just hadn’t realized it.

A tendril launched, an undulating spear of flyers met with a flash of light launched from the human ship. The spear scattered, the remaining stump slithered back into the swarm. The whole swarm bent. Curved into an arc, spreading out across space, circling the human ship.

“That looks… weird,” one of my younger officers whispered. “It’s like they’re… watching.”

“No,” I said. I’d seen this before. Once. “They’re preparing to crash in. Nothing’ll be left.”

Just then, space bent. Distant stars stretched like someone pulled on the fabric of the universe. A ripple, a wrench and a snap.

Ship appeared, more sharpened cylinders like the human ship, but bigger. A wall of small metallic asteroids. The swarm recoiled. The cloud of biosignals bending like a ripple was sent through it. A ripple that looked… like fear.

The cloud sharpened into three spears and charged at the wall of human ships, aiming for where the gaps seemed the largest. More lights tore forth shredding the tendrils. It recoiled and tried again, then again. Then, we watched in stunned silence as it surged in the opposite direction. It ran. Or it tried to.

Human cruisers dispersed, slicing past the cloud. Others flanked escape vectors, weapons fire boxing in the swarm. It shuddered and curved, then bent inward into a sphere. The humans fired on. Nuclear missiles tore glowing chunks out of the sphere as more lasers left lifeless husks adrift.

Then we saw her, the matriarch, with a face of something half insect, half lizard. Six glowing eyes stared death into my crew. She opened a gaping maw and screamed. A raw electromagnetic wail that made every system on our bridge flicker. Even the light of stars seemed to shiver.

Human ships swarmed her. Lasers cutting into her like she was nothing but meat. Mining beams opened her plating, machines latched on, sawing carapace and shredding flesh. She thrashed and flailed but more machines latched on, clamping down on the writhing tentacles. Swarms of lifeforms charged at the ships but all were blown away.

Her screams faded, then died. Silence fell on the bridge. None of us could speak. None comprehended what we just witnessed. The comm clicked to life.

“Admiral,” came the human captain’s voice, casual as she ever was. “We’re just about done here. Do your orders still stand? Or should we head back to alliance space?”

Every head turned toward me. My throat felt tight.

“Yes,” I voice cracked. I coughed once, clearing my throat. “My orders stand. Return home, Captain.”

“Aye aye, sir.”

The channel closed.

The bridge was silent again as I sat. My tail trembled against the cold floor. They weren’t soft. These primates weren’t prey. They were predators who had replaced their nails with steel, changed their fangs for fire. These were predators who built their own weapons, shaped them, perfected them faster than an enemy could learn to wield them. They were monsters wearing metal skins. And they stood among us.",40,1764397359.0,HFY,5,0.92,False

1p9hody,https://i.redd.it/wfzrwqx2y44g1.jpeg,Anyone else miss those early 2000s chatrooms and cyber café days? I made a tiny one out of nostalgia.,"Last night I was getting bored and scrolling X, and suddenly I saw a post about those **early 2000s chatrooms**. And it really brought back that old feeling. When the internet was simple… no rules, no pressure, no fancy apps. Just a nickname, a few strangers, and pure adda.

As a Bangali, I think many of you from Kolkata will get this. Those cyber café days… slow net, Orkut scraps, Yahoo Messenger, random chats with people you’d never meet again. Everything felt lighter, more honest.

Out of that nostalgia, I ended up making a small chatroom more like a tiny café corner on the internet. Very simple. No login, no history, nothing stored. Just only a nickname and your message, whatever you say exists only while you’re there, then it just disappears.

You can chat with strangers and make new friends… or create your own little circle and talk with your buddies. It’s fun, private, and quiet good for a peaceful chat with someone special or just some silly banter with your group.

Nothing big, nothing modern, just something I built because I genuinely miss that older internet vibe when things felt human.

Some conversations are beautiful exactly because they don’t stay forever.",11,1764397125.0,kolkata,12,0.87,False
