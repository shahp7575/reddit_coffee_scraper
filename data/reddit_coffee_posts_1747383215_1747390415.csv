## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of a fish tank coffee table lies not only in its visual charm but also in its functional design. Key features contribute considerably to its overall performance and user experience.

These dimensions ensure that the table seamlessly integrates into most living room layouts without overwhelming the space.**filtration System:** A crucial element of any fish tank coffee table is its filtration system. Most models incorporate a multi-stage filtration system, including mechanical, chemical, and biological filtration.

Many systems include a submersible pump with adjustable flow rates for customization.

**Lighting System:** The integrated lighting system enhances the visual appeal of the fish tank and supports the growth of aquatic plants. Typically, these systems utilize LED lights, which are energy-efficient and provide a long lifespan. Some models offer adjustable lighting modes, allowing users to simulate natural daylight conditions and create a visually stunning display. Programmable timers allow for automatic light cycles.

**Heating System:** Maintaining the optimal water temperature is critical for the health of the fish. Fish tank coffee tables usually feature a submersible heater with adjustable thermostat settings. this allows users to maintain a consistent water temperature suitable for the specific species of fish being kept. The heater is typically concealed within the filtration system for a seamless look.

**Construction Materials:** The durability and longevity of a fish tank coffee table depend heavily on the quality of the materials used in its construction. The tank itself is typically crafted from high-quality acrylic or tempered glass, offering excellent clarity and resistance to scratches and impacts. The surrounding frame is frequently enough made from solid wood or durable composite materials, providing a stable and aesthetically pleasing base.

**Accessibility and Maintenance:** ease of access for cleaning and maintenance is a critical consideration. Many models feature a hinged or removable top, allowing for easy access to the tank for water changes, filter maintenance, and general cleaning.

\-I noticed it slows down a bit around furniture edges, turning more gently and using the side brushes to get into corners. When it cleans right along the wall, the mop roller seems to extend to stay close to the edge, and the corners and sides are cleaner than I expected.

\-Some dog hair gets caught on the wheels, but the brush hasn‚Äôt been too bad.

‚ÄúMy son has announced, at age eleven, that he wants to go to UCLA so he can stay close to his family.

What is the science behind it?,"Just a brief background about me, I am an Indian, and I am learning to cook Indian food. The constant feedback I get is that I undercooked or overcooked/burnt the spices. I have tried whole spice and powdered spice.

The main template I observed at home is, heat up the oil, throw in the whole spice (mustard or cumin), then add onion. Once it's cooked, add in the powdered spices (coriander seed, turmeric, pepper). Then, once the oil is released, add in the main item (meat or veggies or lentils) and cook for 5 - 10 mins or till water is released in items like meat. Then pour in water to cover everything in the pot and cook it.

What is the science behind adding in the onion? What would change if I skip the onion? How to check if the spices are cooked? Any tips to ensure the spices are cooked? Can I cook the spices in bulk and just store it to be added in later? I understand that is how restaurants cook, will that help with my issue?

Another main point I want to understand and the main reason for this thread. I have seen Chinese cooking on YouTube regarding the making of chilli oil. They only pour hot oil in the spice, and it all seems to be cooked with just that. I assume it's a fool-proof way to get spices cooked well. Can I incorporate that cooking technique to cook coriander seed powder?

Am I right to assume that the primary objective of cooking the spice is to infuse the flavors of the spice to the oil and the oil will coat on the food, effectively transferring the flavor to the food?

With coffee and tea, I found that cold-brew method is fool-proof, and I am able to have a consistent taste for all the cups. Can I cold-brew spices with oil?

Also, as it seems connected, if oil is the medium to extract and transfer the flavor. Is there an alternative? Can I use water instead of oil?

Cleaning onion is a hassle and I cry when I cut it. Soaking it in water doesn't seem to help much. Oil, I have kinda burnt the oil a couple of times, and it seems to create sticky fumes that stick around the cooking area. That is the primary reason I started to wonder if I can skip those 2 items from my cooking.",3,1747389157.0,AskCulinary,1,0.8,False

But somewhere along the way, people started treating it like the hammer for every nail ‚Äî even when all you need is a screwdriver and 50 lines of scikit-learn.

Worse, it‚Äôs often *worse* than simpler models: harder to interpret, slower to train, and prone to overfitting unless you know exactly what you're doing. And let‚Äôs be honest, most people don‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a weird prestige in saying you used a neural network, even if it barely improved performance or made your pipeline a nightmare to deploy. 

Meanwhile, solid statistical models are sitting there like, ‚ÄúI could‚Äôve done this with one feature and a coffee.‚Äù

1knwwbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1knwwbv/aitah_for_bearing_my_soul_to_my_mum_about_my/,AITAH for bearing my soul to my mum about my feelings,"Hi everyone, I'm stressing a lot over some things that I said to my mum recently. This might be a long post, I have so much on my mind, so apologies for that. 

To add some context, my childhood was rough, we were dirt poor and only my father worked, my mum left her job after getting pregnant with me. I have no idea how they arranged things when they decided to have a child, I was told it was a decision they have come to together, but instead of figuring out living accommodations for a new family, my father brought his pregnant wife to live in the second bedroom of his parents' flat. So for years (until my sister was born) all three of us shared a small-ish bedroom. When my sister came, it got even worse, but that's another story. 

My father is an alcoholic and has been for as long as I can remember. I still have memories of being a small child and playing outside with the neighbours' kids and seeing my father come home from work completely out of it, stumbling, talking to himself, wildly gesticulating to no one in particular. I still remember the shame and embarrassment of other kids asking me what's wrong with your dad and me just wishing the ground would swallow me. My parents are also fanatical Christians, and I have been raised with the church being mandatory, having to go whenever there were sermons, having to fast to please God, even when I was ill and a child, having to appreciate my being poor because Jesus was poor too, etc.. My father also beat me with the belt or the wooden clothes hanger for reasons such as having a different opinion than him on things, or wanting things that other kids had, or having the audacity to go out to play when my homework wasn't fully done. I still remember being a child and wearing a long sleeve in the (scorching hot) summer because I had very noticeable bruises on my arms that I didn't want the other kids to see. Needless to say, my childhood sucked. I was poor, wearing hand me downs from the church, not allowed to skip church or have normal food during fasting periods, beaten for displaying normal child behaviour, made to listen to hours-long lectures from my father every time he felt that I was growing up to be someone he didn't want me to be, made to watch and listen to my his drunken shit. 

My mum is a good person, she is kind, generous, self-sacrificing. However, she is also a devout follower and has had this idea that she has to obey her husband at all costs and love him no matter what, because she made a promise to God to do so. Which meant that she went along with my father's ideas of parenting and couldn't really trust in her to protect me whilst growing up. After my sister came, the focus shifted from me, which gave me a bit more freedom to start being my own person and move away from my father's fucked up mentality. My mum also got a little bit more involved with parenting, which resulted in my sister not knowing how the belt feels, and my sister not having to fast as a child. 

Anyway, I left home as soon as the opportunity came up, I was 19. I left countries and never looked back. I still keep in touch with my mum, but not with my father. My sister also moved out about a year ago, which left my mum alone with him. I don't get told what goes on most of the time, because my mum and sister feel like they don't want to burden me with things I cannot do anything about. Only at times, one of them would break down and give me snippets of what troubles them. My father is still a drunk pig, most of the money goes on his booze, he still comes home drunk and puts on a show for the neighbours, belittles my mum and sister, calls them names, swears at them, tells them he should have never gotten involved with this shit family, that he was better off without them, blah blah. My sister just flips him off and does her thing most of the times, but my mum deeply suffers. She has been sleeping in the other bedroom for so long now, before my sister moved out they were sharing a room because mum couldn't deal with him anymore. But she still does everything for him, she cooks, cleans, washes his clothes, irons them, washes his dishes, makes his coffee. Meanwhile, the dirtbag is telling her he's not happy, he's misunderstood, that she's not looking after him. My mum thinks all of this is because she's not spreading her legs for him, which I believe to be true. A few years ago she was begging me to forgive him for who he is, because he's my father, but after having a stern short conversation with her telling her that I cannot bring myself to do that, she let it go. She still sometimes tries to put him on the phone when I call her, and I just ask for her back. 

She is miserable, depressed, stressed, she has started to have physical symptoms because of her living situation with him, she's on high blood pressure medication now. Even the doctor said to her that the tablets will only do so much, and that she needs to change her living circumstances. Now, I have actively been thinking about this, and terrified that one day I'll get a call that she's in hospital or something. My partner, who has been so supportive of me, told me that he wants us to buy a house in the next few years where my mum could have her own room. I was incredibly touched by this and could not have been more grateful for him thinking about her and being open to have her live with us. I finally told my mum this and I was met with an instantaneous NO. She couldn't leave her home, her country, her life. No, absolutely not. She didn't even want to see the incredibly loving gesture of my partner having her in his thoughts and wanting to extend such a kindness. She wouldn't even let me talk, kept talking over me that she can't leave, this is where she lives, her things are there, she has everything she needs where she is now. And I kinda lost it. I started asking her what exactly does she have, she is dependent on him financially, she hasn't worked a day in 30 years, has no savings, nothing. If it weren't for his work pension she would have none of these things she says she has. I reminded her of how much of a pig he is, how he treats her, disrespects her and my sister, how she's ill because of all of this, how even the doctor raised this red flag, how her children worry about her health and wellbeing. She shut me down and said this is what she deserves. I told her that fuck knows what possessed her to think she was ready to have kids, and that she should've abstained from having them. I said that her choices fucked me up and now I'm living with stress, regret, depression because she decided to have kids with an asshole and submit and follow his fucked up views on parenting and the world. Also told her that she is delusional and instead of accepting the help she is given to get out of the shit she's in she chooses to make herself a martyr and continues to let her kids worry and stress. She was crying and I felt awful. Now I feel like I shouldn't have snapped and should have at least worded it differently and taken a more kind approach. I know that now she'll be thinking about this and feeling like shit. I also cannot bring myself to call her right now to make it right because I am still hurt. So she will stew like this for longer because I can't get myself to talk to her yet. AITAH for saying these things to her? I have no clarity right now, my mind is in shambles.

She told me that I was controlling and made her feel sick and ashamed of herself, the last week this has been eating at me and I‚Äôm slowly realizing the was at least 70% in the right. Of course from my point of view I was just trying to help out a friend in a bad situation, and yes I was a little pushy but I didn‚Äôt think I was a bad person.
     Four days ago depression hit me like a wave and I was going through the old text messages and  I think she was right. At least partially. I have a habit of flip flopping whether or not I‚Äôm happy with someone, if that makes sense. Like I think I‚Äôve been angry at just about all the people I know for usually petty reasons, of course I don‚Äôt mention it and I let the feelings pass. But I fear I was probably being too passive aggressive to her on accident. 
   I think I get why she cut me off though. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a heathy person to be around. I go from being distant to overly clingy way to fast. Im usually extremely negative or very lucid and relax.        To someone I get to close with I get why she couldn‚Äôt deal with it.
   Today was a trip. I was so depressed four days ago, I couldn‚Äôt eat and I could barely hold a conversation. But today I was so awake. Again I still have barely ate but I was at work and I had so much energy. It was like I was happy but almost too much. I didn‚Äôt notice until my co worker joked about me being on crack, I couldn‚Äôt really think I felt wired like one does when over doing it on the coffee, but without the coffee and without the headache. Actually I felt super clear but also out of it. It was like everything made sense but I couldn‚Äôt remember what I did 5 seconds ago. 
    Again I‚Äôm just looking for advice, I intend  to look for a therapist for other maybe related issues but I don‚Äôt know how one even finds a good one. Maybe I‚Äôm just stupid idk.

If you‚Äôre drawn to clean lines, warm tones, and a peaceful atmosphere, you might fall in love with Japandi style d√©cor‚Äîjust like I did. It‚Äôs a blend of Japanese minimalism and Scandinavian coziness that can totally transform your space without overwhelming it.

Here are a few simple tips that helped me bring Japandi home d√©cor into my own living room:

**1. Start with a neutral base**  
Choose soft, muted colors like off-white, beige, charcoal, and soft greys. These tones create a calming foundation that makes other design elements stand out more subtly.

**2. Invest in functional statement pieces**  
One of my favorite finds is a Minimalist Wooden Coffee Table from [Katana Home](https://katanahome.com/). It‚Äôs handcrafted, elegant, and practical‚Äîexactly what Japandi is all about. Choose pieces that are beautiful but serve a purpose.

**3. Keep it clutter-free**  
Japandi thrives on open space. Use smart storage solutions and be intentional with d√©cor. Every item should have meaning or utility‚Äîno filler allowed!

**4. Add texture through natural materials**  
Think wood, linen, cotton, and stone. This adds warmth without sacrificing the clean aesthetic. A Japandi Coffee Table in solid wood, or even a mango wood side table, can bring in that natural character.

**5. Mix minimalism with comfort**  
Throw in a soft rug, textured throw pillows, or a cozy chair to balance the sleek lines with livability. Minimalist doesn‚Äôt mean sterile.

If you‚Äôve started your own Japandi transformation, I‚Äôd love to hear your go-to tips or see photos of your space. Also open to recommendations‚Äîespecially for compact furniture or smart layouts for smaller rooms.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

(this was before i started the relationship). i had photos with her, who was also my classmate in my profile. im not telling that i didnt made a mistake. i know what mistakes are ive done. yeah, everyone except who doesnt know about me would think that this friend of mine will be my gf. there was no such photos in a bad way. photos were like im drinking a tea, or coffee in the opposite side with friends. a situation happened, where two of my friends who are working woman, came to my place and stayed there. i know there bfs and they know me too. they know us, she was like my sister. i never even touched her in a bad way (shakehand and casual hugs were the only physical touch i had). ive told a lot about this friendship to her and ive told the time she saved me. and when she stayed at my place. we had only one room and we all stayed together. i kept my distance from them. and i was even in chat with my gf. later after 1,2 months. she started blaming me for something i have never done. that ive cheated and told i had physical with this person. i teared up immediately because when i heard such things from the person i love the most, it was shattering. i understood that the friendship might have shown and raised her insecurities. she told me cut off the friendship and i did. i blocked my friend from everywhere, even calls, socials, everywhere. we got back together and days later she started blaming again and called me a cheater again. she promised that it was a mistake to call me that and said she would never say anything if i get rid of her. and i did. this was last year. but the topic came back everytime she got mad at me. i cried a lot. begged her to understand me. she asked me to delete the photos of my friend which was included along with others. i told no because i was getting blamed, accused and names she calls me was beyond rude. i know this issue will come later even if i delete it. she told she wont blame me. i deleted it and continued. yesterday she blamed again. i have apologised a thousand times to her. and she told me she forgave them too. she uses the saddest things i shared with her when shes angry. i asked her not to, politely. and just right now, she called me a fatherless mf (my dad died when i was 14, it was tough. ive shared this with her and i have cried about it). why cant she forgive me. i know my mistakes. i begged her. she did some unacceptable things just because she was angry. she installed bumble 2 hours after the breakup and told a guy she likes him. but wait for few months because she dont want to be in a rebound relationship. and also flirted with another guy and confessed that to me out of guilt. she did texted her ex (there was nothing romantic from her side, but replied to a romantic text he sent) just because she was angry at me to have a friend. i love her and i want to fix this however i could. she blocked me. i dont know what i did. im ready to apologise even a thousand times more.

That isn‚Äôt new information for my brain, but suddenly at almost 30 years old, I am seeing just how bad it actually was. It‚Äôs brought up a lot of anxiety and intense anger that isn‚Äôt going away like it used to. For context, I was raised by addicts, so there were a lot of people in and out of the house. There was a lot of conflict and I was often the subject of it. Dad was in prison. A lot of CPS calls. My older sibling died when I was 5 and I was unfortunately the one who found her. Very traumatizing stuff, but my mom checked out for a long time after that and got deeper into addiction, which was worse somehow. I only realize now that she was checked out my WHOLE childhood, having previously told myself she was present for parts here and there‚Ä¶ but once I did the math, added up all the years she was absent, and the fact she worked nights since before I was born, it isn‚Äôt possible that she was there for almost any of it. A lot of bad things happened to me because of this and my mental health suffered not only severely, but noticeably. I resent that she didn‚Äôt help me, and just forgot she still had a child who was alive.

As an adult though, things seemingly improved. As long as we didn‚Äôt see each other often or for long periods of time, we got along seemingly fine. Distant, strained, but ‚Äúfine.‚Äù However last month for Easter, the catalyst for this feeling I‚Äôm having occurred. I celebrated with my close friend‚Äôs family, whose mom I have always gotten along with very well. As soon as I arrived, she was asking me about my life, and we talked for hours on and off while I was there. I had driven over an hour to get there, so instead of having me drive back late at night, she made a bed for me in the guest room. Put fresh linens on and everything. In the morning, she had fresh coffee waiting for me. Everything about it just made me feel so cared for, and immediately I was feeling grief for these things I wanted from my mom. And ever since that night, I have realized not only how little my mom cared for me, but how she never expresses curiosity about knowing me. I called her a few days later and asked if she could name any interests of mine. I have several interests. She couldn‚Äôt name one. All this is to say, it‚Äôs been a few weeks, and my mind is still racing with overanalysis of my childhood and rage toward my parents. I confronted my mom unexpectedly over the phone the other day, which I keep switching between feeling relieved and ashamed by. It has made me want to go no contact, which obviously appears to have come out of nowhere, because up until now, my parents and I have been ‚Äúfine.‚Äù So I can‚Äôt help but question the way I am feeling and whether I‚Äôm wrong. It‚Äôs been pretty unbearable and confusing. I‚Äôm going back to therapy next week, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can relate to the racing thoughts and rage upon realizing these things as an adult? I was worried I was experiencing mania, but this doesn‚Äôt match any of the descriptions I read. I guess I just want to know if this response is normal. ",13,1747387172.0,CPTSD,4,1.0,False
1knwgn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1knwgn7/what_is_the_strangest_way_you_found_out_a_friend/,What is the strangest way you found out a friend was Wealthy?,"Here is my story which may sound like a movie.

(I asked this question a couple of days back in r/delhi, and it was interesting to see the experiences of many people, so I thought to ask it on this sub too. I'm copy-pasting my experience.)

So, this happened last year in mid-2024.

We were all 21-22 year olds Engineering Students doing our summer internship at a renowned tech company in Noida. There was a 21 year old girl with us in the same company, who was pursuing¬†[B.Tech](http://B.Tech)¬†in Computer Science from one of the top colleges in Delhi (One of it from IIITD, DTU and NSUT). She was brilliant-with exceptional Coding skills and Tech knowledge, and was very hardworking.

We were 5‚Äì6 students there from different colleges but we all quickly bonded well and became friends. That girl was pretty friendly, had a great sense of humour, smart and was very humble with everybody, and was gorgeous. She looked to hail from a well to do but grounded family. If I go in little detail:

1. She used to dress very well but not flashy and had 3-4 pairs of shoes that she repeated alternatively. All were from brands like Puma and Adidas.
2. She used an iPhone 13 Pro Max-an almost 3 year old model then as it was launched in 2021, and had Airpods as well as a Macbook.
3. She had amazing communication skills and spoke fluent English with a mix of modern slang and impressed us all with her knowledge‚Äînot just in tech, but also in geo-politics, economics, and even Sanskrit. She often quoted the Bhagavad Gita and would explain deep philosophical meanings from it, and all of were very impressed as well as initially surprised. As I'm into spirituality too, we both used to have a good time discussing many aspects of this and I learnt a lot from her.
4. She was very respectful towards everyone and used to speak to the Senior Engineers or the peon/security guard with the same politeness.
5. She used to reside in Noida itself and come to the Office via Metro and E-rickshaw. First, she to used to board from a Metro station nearest to her home in Noida, come to the nearest metro station of Office and then take an E-rickshaw to reach the Office which was about 2-3 kilometres away from the Metro station.

In all, she seemed to come from an upper middle class family as per Delhi NCR standards-comfortable, but not ultra-rich. As many youngsters today own an iPhone (For example-I come from one such middle class family and myself owned an iPhone) and Airpods and branded Shoes, it was kind off ordinary and not something out of the World.

Days and weeks passed. After the working hours, we all (5‚Äì6 people) used to eat the street food like Golgappe (that she loved the most) and Momo together after the office hours and were having a good time. She didn‚Äôt seem to be different from us at all in terms of financial background.

Until one day.

It was the time of mid-August, and there was a sudden and heavy rain at the evening right after the working hours. We were all standing near the gate inside the Office premises chit-chatting and looking at the rain and waiting for it to stop, but it didn‚Äôt give any such signs.

15-20 minutes passed but still, it was raining heavily. 2 people booked cabs and left. We were 4 people left now, when I asked her plans about leaving. She said she would wait for another 10 minutes and if she still couldn‚Äôt find any E-rickshaw, then she will ‚Äúsee‚Äù. As it was raining heavily, there were no E-rickshaws nearby too. (She used to take an E-rickshaw to the Metro station daily.)

Neither the rain stopped nor she could find any E-rickshaw and 10 minutes passed. As I was observing her, she sent a text to somebody and right after a minute, got a call. She spoke something for 20 seconds or so and went near the gate and started walking back and forth there as she was waiting for someone.

We all went there too and started chit-chatting among ourselves when, after around 10 minutes- a really long, white Car with the windows tinted pulled up right in front of her. We could see a well dressed chauffeur inside and as we could even process what was happening, the chauffeur quickly came out towards her with an umbrella and opened the door for her.

That car was a Rolls Royce Ghost. Yes, a freaking Rolls Royce.

As we just stood there speechless, she smiled, said goodbye to all of us and quickly moved towards the Car and sat on the back seat, while the driver closed her door gently, and returned to the driver's seat and the Car glided away.

For those who don‚Äôt know, that Car was worth over ‚Çπ7 Crore on-road and is one of the most expensive and the most luxurious sedans in the World.

We were pretty curious and asked her the other day whether it was her Car. And, it was only then when we came to know that:

1. Her Father was a multi-millionaire Businessman and she hailed from one of the most Wealthiest families of Noida (and all of Delhi NCR). She used to reside in a luxurious Mansion and had multiple Luxury cars including a Range Rover, a Porsche SUV as well as a Ferrari in her garage.
2. As I was not from Noida, I was not familiar at that time, but she lived in one of the most posh localities of Noida. (one of it from sector 26, sector 15A and sector 44-These 3 are the most posh sectors of Noida.)
3. She had visited over 20 Countries at the age of 21, and her Home had a huge library especially curated for her and had more than 200 books.
4. Her dad had gifted her a BMW on her 21st Birthday just a few months back, for her own drives in the City as she was fond of driving.
5. She came from an old-Money family which is wealthy since the 1960s. Though now defunct as they ventured into other Businesses with time, her great-grandfather and his brothers used to own one of the largest Sugar Mills in the 1960s and 70s and were among the Wealthiest men in North India in those times.

The most surprising part? She had never travelled in the Metro before the internship. She said that she just wanted to try it for once. She liked the experience, found it convenient and economical for the short distance (of 5-6 km), and decided to keep doing it. That‚Äôs how we all thought she was just like one of us.

Inspite of being ultra rich, she was really very humble all the time with not even 1% of arrogance anywhere, and everybody admired her and she seemed to be just perfect who made everybody smile. There was some brilliant glow on her face all the time.

She invited all of us to her Residence at the end of the Internship for a Lunch party and it was simply stunning and a next level experience. Huge bungalow, ultra lavish interiors, jovial and a very welcoming family, and a chef who cooked like a five-star hotel.

**P.S.**¬†She‚Äôs doing great in her career‚Äîgot placed in one of the topmost tier Tech company. We both recently met for a coffee in a south Delhi lounge and had a great time. I could see how happy she was in her job and in her life altogether, she told me how she plans to continue working in Tech and not join her Family Business as she thinks she doesn't have the knack for Entrepreneurship and Business.

So, this was my experience and the strangest way I found out a friend was super Wealthy. What's your story?",1,1747387170.0,AskIndia,2,0.6,False

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.

‚òÅÔ∏è Notes : White Musk, Peony, Freesia, Green Notes, Peach, Plum, Lily, Lily-of-the-Valley, Green Grass, Jasmine, Ylang-Ylang, Rose, Coffee, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Coriander, Incense, Tonka Bean and Cedar.

‚òÅÔ∏è What Am I Actually Smelling : It opens with a fresh, green, almost grassy scent, reminiscent of children's bar soaps that come in various animal shapesü•∫üßº. As it evolves, the fragrance matures and shifts towards a more subtle, creamy note, similar to Dove soap or those white cream soaps. The dry down is where things get interesting ‚Äì I detect a hint of coriander (dhania), possibly due to the grassy notes. There's no rose or coffee, just a soft, creamy, soapy quality, like a gentle incense whisper.

‚òÅÔ∏è Remarks : Interestingly, It shares similarities with Ghost in the Shell by Etat, one of my favorite skin scents, but the green notes in the opening set it apart. The dry down, however, is somewhat similar ü§î. Imagine fresh out of the shower, the original Dove body wash still lingering and a hint of baby products in the dry downü•∫. Pairing it with BBW's If You Musk was pure magic üòÅ ‚Äì it created a ""no-perfume perfume"" scent. Noa's effortless quality shines through as a skin scent. However.....the bottle is a different storyüò≠ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's literally like a slippery slope! The angelic and cute ass bottle is what I like to call a ""ticking time bomb of fragility""üò≠.

‚òÅÔ∏è Performance : 5-6 hrs on the skin and 7-8 hrs on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it pretty much settles down into a creamy bar of soapy scent and the softest incense.

1knw7ez,https://i.redd.it/hhvjaaluz31f1.jpeg,Passed 3rd time!,"Hi!

As you can see, I managed to passed 3rd time at arguably one of the hardest test centres at Belvedere in London.

I only picked up 1 minor somehow‚Ä¶

I failed 2 tests prior to this at Erith

Just remember you have to drive smart and safe for the duration of the test, the hard part is doing all that with someone watching you.

If you do things that will impress your examiner, the better chance you have at passing‚Ä¶ for example, on my test, at the junction leaving the test centre at 7:43am, I made a very quick decision to pull out in-front of a car as otherwise we would have sat there all day - I did it safely and therefore wasn‚Äôt marked down for it, also the car I pulled in-front didn‚Äôt have to slow down. He complimented me at the end and said most people would have waited.

Imagine you‚Äôre an uber driver for 40 minutes‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what I did ü§£

I woke up, had coffee, a banana and (funnily enough) some dark chocolate, I heard it can have a calming effect on nerves (not my regular breakfast by any means) üòÜ

Apparently it all worked out anyways.

Goodluck to you all!",6,1747386046.0,LearnerDriverUK,2,1.0,False

We were in Melbourne and we went to stay at this hotel resort and I complimented a woman‚Äôs/the owners coat and she got angry with me for not allowing her to start a conversation with me because I said I love your coat as I walked past. I was stalked by a jaguar there, there was a walkway to our room that was in a bamboo forest and it was there. And then we were in Africa, I feel like it was Egypt but there were no clich√© pyramids so idk why I think it was Egypt. And we walked along a beach covered in market stalls and tarps and people and he went for a swim and he was swimming along beside me and I was walking and then he went off somewhere I saw him walk out of the sea and walk up the dune and I kept walking e way I was heading and I found this big structure and I was scared to go around it, not scared but uneasy, but I did because I saw a small trickle of people going around it so I forged forward and saw the most magical night sky with a subtle aurora borealis - or whichever it would be around the African region as I doubt it‚Äôs north enough - and then I woke up. Wait at the hotel/resort there was this big pool maze and surrounded by new Greek/roman architecture. I remember floating around trying to subtly flat away from some people who kept trying to be friendly and I was friendly but wanted to float alone. 

I feel so sick this morning. And why am I not waking up for so long?!?! 

Is honalee a place? No, it‚Äôs fictional. It‚Äôs also Honah Lee. I remember for the longest time thinking they were talking about Hawaii because of Honalulu. 

Still feel like it‚Äôs no children for me. 

So. Much. Work. To. Get. Through. Arrrrgggh.

I was thinking while making a coffee today, and it‚Äôs not left my mind since hence sharing it to this journal, is using bug spray basically the same as chemical warfare against another species? Because‚Ä¶ kinda seems so. I feel like a monster. 

No therapy today :( I‚Äôm disappointed because I think I could have really used a session today, I don‚Äôt always get anything out of the sessions but that‚Äôs expected, but it can still feel like a sort of relief to untangle my thoughts and feelings, yknow. 

I guess I‚Äôm definitely going to my parents - mum texted with a random ‚ÄòSee you tonight!‚Äô and then followed with pictures of pup looking out the window and saying how he‚Äôs already waiting for me. So. Kinda stuck. I want to go though so it‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm stressy about work that‚Äôs all. 

I saw a podcast ep about ‚Äúdecentering men‚Äù today and‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm kind of intrigued. I wonder if it‚Äôs something I should try encompass in my life and mindset. I don‚Äôt know much about it, but based on what I briefly got the gist of it‚Äôs about taking men off of the pedestal - including the need or desire for validation from them, at least to a strong degree. Centering men is apparently seeking their approval and validation. Measuring your self worth on how men perceive you and your ‚Äúromantic attention‚Äù and presumably history with them. Prioritising their wants and needs over your own - that sort of fits into the first point though. And making life decisions or any decisions based around how it‚Äôll impact your place with men. I‚Äôm kind of wary, because there are so many women out there who hate men and  are basically misandrists and I‚Äôm 100% **not** that. I love men. I want a man. I think men - the good ones - can be utterly brilliant. There are good men and sucky men, same as with women. I don‚Äôt have an issue with *men*, but I wonder if I should give more thought about how I place men in my world. I don‚Äôt *think* it‚Äôs about hating men, avoiding relationships or being closed off to them or anything, if it is then I‚Äôm not interested,  it it seems to be more about prioritising your own choices, wants and needs and not allowing the validation etc from men to guide those choices. I mean to an extent, I think once you‚Äôre in a relationship you obviously are one of two and you‚Äôre a team and make decisions that are best for the two of you, so I mean it‚Äôs aside from that. Anyway it‚Äôs supposed to be empowering and help you centre yourself and your hobbies and self and blah blah blah anyway I‚Äôm bored of this now. 

I got the train, I had to run for the first one. When I got off the second train there were these two kids on their scooters racing up and down and they said see ya later alligator to me when I put my bags in the car which was random, they were like 12 year old boys so probably thought it was hilaaaaaaaaaarious. I said bye! back. I wanted to ask if they knew how to get home as it was dark and in the wops but they purposefully missed the bus so probably waiting for a parent. Ever since I have a niece and nephew I think about this stuff more. 

I‚Äôm at mum & dads and puppy was so excitable to see me :) we had a frittata for dinner, I love black garlic a lot, and then we did the crossword. It‚Äôs so warm here with the fireplace! I love fireplaces.

Picture this: it‚Äôs 8 AM, my coffee‚Äôs barely kicked in, and I‚Äôm lecturing on stress and strain to a room of bleary-eyed undergrads. I decide to spice things up with a demo, a classic ‚Äúbend the beam‚Äù experiment to show deflection under load. Simple, right? Spoiler: Nope.

I set up this flimsy aluminum beam, clamp it down, and start hanging weights. I‚Äôm mid-sentence, waxing poetic about Young‚Äôs modulus, when one of my students, let‚Äôs call him Jake, the guy who always has a Monster Energy drink and a questionable haircut‚Äîraises his hand. ""Yo, Prof, what if we, like, over-engineer this bad boy?"" The class perks up. I‚Äôm intrigued but skeptical. ‚ÄúOver-engineer how, Jake?‚Äù I ask, expecting some half-baked idea. He grins and says, ‚ÄúLemme reinforce it with‚Ä¶ stuff.‚Äù Before I can say ‚Äúsafety protocols,‚Äù Jake and his lab group are raiding the supply closet like it‚Äôs a post-apocalyptic scavenger hunt.Ten minutes later, they‚Äôve duct-taped two steel rulers, a stack of popsicle sticks, and‚ÄîI kid you not‚Äîa broken TI-84 calculator to my beam. The class is losing it, half of them are filming this for TikTok, and I‚Äôm just standing there, wondering if I‚Äôm about to file an incident report. Their ‚Äúreinforced‚Äù beam looks like a steampunk fever dream.I figure, what the hell, let‚Äôs test it. I start piling on weights. 5 kg. 10 kg. 15 kg. The beam‚Äôs holding, and the class is cheering like it‚Äôs the Super Bowl. At 20 kg, there‚Äôs a loud CRACK‚Äîthe calculator shatters, popsicle sticks fly, and the duct tape gives up on life. The beam bends like a soggy noodle, and the room erupts in laughter. Jake yells, ‚ÄúWE ALMOST HAD IT!‚Äù Here‚Äôs the kicker: after class, I ran the numbers. Their Franken-beam actually reduced deflection by 12% before it catastrophically failed. I‚Äôm torn between giving them an A for creativity or a lecture on why duct tape isn‚Äôt a structural material.

1knw4sb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knw4sb,"Locavore NXT ‚Äî Ubud, Bali","The night at Locavore NXT begins with a welcome drink and a pair of headphones. 

You are made to listen to a short introductory track detailing the goal of thinking more about our own environments before diving into a salad with a whole fried freshwater eel inside.

After the introductory bite, you‚Äôre led into a subterranean mushroom chamber to forage in a terrarium for your second course and then directed up into their gorgeous main dining room for the remainder of your meal. 

The presentation of dishes, many of which are finished table-side, was extremely friendly and a great touch to the experience.

Locavore NXT is a masterclass in hyper-local cuisine (everything, including the ingredients, furniture, etc is from Indonesia) and truly innovative. 

Though I wouldn‚Äôt say any of the flavors are things I‚Äôll remember / think about weeks from now, the vast majority of the  dishes were good and I was very impressed by the story behind each one.

One thing to note is that their alcoholic drink pairing is insanely low ABV. I‚Äôd likely skip if I visited again.

The highlights for me were the Cassava noodles (image 7), the ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù cheese made from nuts (image 9) and the all things breadfruit (last image). 

Menu:
Into the wild (salad with fried eel) - A bit plain, the eel lacked flavor.

Foraged (mushroom custard from inside terrarium) - Not bad, served with a pleasant mushroom broth.

Charred SCOBY, NXT mushrooms, fungi amazake - Good introductory bite in the main dining room

Fermented tofu, pumpkin, sago pearls - Beautifully plated, but not super memorable flavor wise

Savoury fruit, butterfly peas, peanuts, sea beans - Really interesting. Especially enjoyed the peas and the tomato they had soaked in salt water.

Cassava noodles, sea urchin, skate wing, zero-waste dashi - Amazing texture on the noodles and flavorful dashi. One of the best courses.

Raw lamb, LabX condiments, matoa fruit - First time trying raw lamb and it was quite enjoyable.

Work in progress... (nut-based cheese with rice-based honey) - Super creative and creamy cheese made entirely without dairy. Loved the fermented rice based honey (black dot).

Tempe, sweet potato, Malang apple - To be honest, not very memorable.

Rice koji porridge, soy beans, white kimoni,  rosella - Super deep umami flavor, very yummy.

Catch of the day, bulun baon leaf, two tasty sauces - Perfectly cooked fish with a lovely char on the leaf. I didn‚Äôt love the accompanying sauces.

Kampung chicken, spiny lobster, vanilla, stinky beans - Blended chicken with spiny lobster, very new for me texturally and surprisingly pleasant.

Aged 'bangkal hitam' pork, fermented cassava, oyster XO - The pork itself was amazing but I wish the sauce was a bit punchier. A bit disappointed as if they nailed the sauce this would be a great dish.

Daluman, burnt coconut, soursop - Deep coconut flavor, but not super memorable.

Cashew fruit, coffee, salted caramel - Strong coffee flavor, but again nothing very special.

All things breadfruit - This was super interesting. If someone had told me I was eating a pastry here I‚Äôd absolutely believe them.

Chewy coconut, mulberries, kaffir lime - Served alongside hot chocolate and the breadfruit as a nice closing bite. Pretty good.",3,1747385704.0,finedining,2,1.0,False

Got my DNA test through Ancestry.

Uploaded the data into Genetic Genie at first. Got insights.

Then found Genetic Life Hacks, paid for a monthly subscription, downloaded all the reports in one click. 119 pages.

Then fed it into Claude, chat gpt and chat gpt deep research. (The deep research took ages, but it produced a very in-depth report I can understand based on my results)

And then prompted all 3 to highlight the red flags and green flags.

Then I went down the red flag list 1 by 1 creating a supplement plan along the way.

I did this multiple times across multiple GPTS as a stop gap to get the most accurate information.

I then went and spoke to naturopaths at my local health food store confirming my findings and cross referencing the AI's feedback with their personal experience.

So far its been very effective.

These are my red flags -

# üö© Red Flags Affecting Energy, Focus, and Productivity

# 1. COMT Met/Met (rs4680 A/A) ‚Äì Low COMT enzyme activity

* **What it does:** Slower breakdown of dopamine, adrenaline, and norepinephrine.
* **Why it matters:** Can cause **mental fatigue**, overwhelm, **sensitivity to stress**, and difficulty focusing under pressure. Often leads to mental overactivity or racing thoughts, especially in high-stimulus environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Wired-but-tired feeling, overstimulation, anxious procrastination, mental crash after stress.

# 2. MAOA High-Activity (rs6323 G/G) ‚Äì Faster serotonin & dopamine breakdown

* **What it does:** Reduces levels of calming neurotransmitters like serotonin more quickly.
* **Why it matters:** Can lead to **lower baseline mood**, **less resilience to stress**, and a higher likelihood of fatigue or burnout in high-demand environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Flat mood, irritability, low motivation, sensitivity to sleep loss.

# 3. SOD2 Ala/Ala (rs4880 A/A) ‚Äì Weaker mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme

* **What it does:** Reduces your ability to clear mitochondrial oxidative stress.
* **Why it matters:** Leads to **less efficient cellular energy production**, and **faster mitochondrial fatigue**, especially under stress, high training loads, or poor sleep.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Physical tiredness, sluggishness, headaches, or fatigue that hits earlier in the day than it should.

# 4. GSTM1 Null (gene deleted) ‚Äì Reduced detox capacity

* **What it does:** Limits your ability to detox free radicals and chemical byproducts.
* **Why it matters:** If exposed to toxins, pollution, poor diet, or stress, you‚Äôll accumulate oxidative stress **faster**, which wears down energy and mental clarity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Brain fog, slower recovery, fatigue after alcohol or junk food, sluggish mornings.

# 5. MTHFR A1298C Homozygous (rs1801131 G/G) ‚Äì Mild methylation bottleneck

* **What it does:** Slightly reduces conversion of folate to its active form.
* **Why it matters:** May cause **lower neurotransmitter and energy molecule production**, especially if B2, B6, folate, or B12 are suboptimal.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Low mental energy, slow mental start in the morning, difficulty focusing, more tired on low-carb or low-protein diets.

# 6. FMO3 Variants + BHMT Heterozygous ‚Äì Choline and methylation backup pathway compromise

* **What it does:** Reduces efficiency of homocysteine recycling and choline metabolism.
* **Why it matters:** Choline is needed for acetylcholine (key for focus), methylation (energy + detox), and liver function. Low choline = low productivity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Afternoon slumps, foggy thinking, or mental fatigue with low-protein intake or skipping eggs/meat.

# 7. DAO Variants (rs10156191 + rs2052129) ‚Äì Histamine intolerance

* **What it does:** Slows breakdown of dietary histamine.
* **Why it matters:** **High histamine = brain fog, anxiety, disrupted sleep**, and even energy crashes after eating high-histamine foods (wine, cheese, aged meat, leftovers).
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Energy swings, headaches, irritability after meals, trouble winding down at night.

Supplements I have started taking and will be adding to my existing stack:

# ‚úÖ Suggested Integration Plan (No Overlap, Best Timing)

# üöÄ Morning (Fasting window) ‚Äî Focus + Dopamine Priming

Take with water or light liquid:

* NAC
* L-Tyrosine
* Alpha-GPC
* TMG
* ALCAR
* Mega Magnesium
* Cordyceps
* B-complex
* Zinc
* Alpha Lipoic
* CoQ10
* Fusion Memory
* Stress Ease
* Theanine

‚úÖ *Optional: add 5‚Äì10g sunflower lecithin in liquid (coffee or shake) for early choline support*

# üçΩ 12:30 PM (Meal 1 ‚Äì Break Fast) ‚Äî Dopamine Receptor Growth

Take with food + fats:

* Uridine Monophosphate (300mg)
* Fish Oil (for DHA synergy)
* Sunflower Lecithin (add remainder to meal/smoothie)
* Primal Multi
* Primal Body
* Liver Care
* Methyl B12 + L-Methylfolate
* DIM + I3C with PQQ

# üåô Night (Before Bed) ‚Äî Recovery + Neurobalance

* Switch Nutrition Sleep
* Body Ripped GABA
* Optional: L-Theanine (if needed)

# üîÑ Optional Cycling Notes

* **L-Tyrosine** ‚Äì can be skipped 1‚Äì2x per week to avoid overstimulation (especially COMT Met/Met)
* **Uridine Monophosphate** ‚Äì cycle 5 days on / 2 off or 4 weeks on / 1 off
* **Alpha-GPC** ‚Äì consider cycling opposite uridine if you want to test sensitivity changes
* **DIM** ‚Äì monitor over time; may not need to take continuously

I am still in the process of ordering and being shipped a few supps.

A major AHA moment came today with this little gem:

DRD2 A1 allele (reduced dopamine receptor density) Your reward system might not feel the ‚Äúhit‚Äù from slow progress ‚Äî you need stronger stimuli or more novelty to stay engaged. This makes you crave the start of something new, but disengage when the grind starts. So I should take this?

Uridine Monophosphate (150‚Äì300mg) ‚Üí Supports dopamine receptor density (especially helpful with your DRD2 A1) ‚Üí Great for long-term mood and drive stability

I am getting Uridine next week and combined with choline and fish oil and I cant wait to see what happens.

\------------------------------------------------

This week though ive added in Herbs of gold Stress Ease and Liver Care, COq10 and NAC.

And I've felt the best i have in years. I think a lot of my trouble was clearing away the toxins and also supporting my slow COMT gene with adaptogens like rhodiola and Ashwaghanda (which is in Stress Ease)

I am more focus, clear headed, less time chronically tired and overall feel much lighter already and I have only just started.

**TL;DR**¬†

Using my DNA, Genetic health reports and LLMS I built a personalized supplement stack and I am already seeing fantastic results within the first week of trying it. This all up cost me about $150 USD to get my testing, reports, and results analysis ",3,1747385637.0,Biohackers,3,1.0,False

	‚Ä¢	Culture & sights: Open to museums, parks, walks, architecture, going for a dip‚Äîwhatever makes Oslo feel alive.

I‚Äôd love recs that aren‚Äôt just the tourist checkboxes (though I‚Äôm open to those too if they‚Äôre worth it). I‚Äôm really just hoping to soak up the city at its best. I don‚Äôt think it really matters unless it‚Äôs clothing shops, but I‚Äôm a guy!

Went poop at 4pm and feel dizzy / lightheaded currently at 2am. I feel pain still in my rectal cavity but it's not as bad as earlier. Now I'm not sure my dizzy and lighthead is from the bathroom or not even though it started during it as I drank a large coffee and I take cymbalta which could cause light head and dizziness. I had forgotten if I had taken a cymbalta or not that day, took one as I felt my migraine as thats what I take them for. So I'm not sure if this dizzy spell is from the bathroom per say or possibly taking an extra cymbalta around the time this occurred, while having a large coffee?

1knw15m,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1knw15m/should_i_quit_my_job/,Should I quit my job?,"Hi, I really need some help..
I‚Äôve been working at Starbucks for almost three weeks now. Before I started, I was so excited‚ÄîI had just landed my first job! I received the email confirmation shortly after my interview and was told to wait for a call from the manager. Two weeks passed, and I hadn‚Äôt heard anything‚Äîno calls or emails‚Äîso I thought it was odd and decided to follow up. I called the store and the manager directly, but there was no response. I even tried texting, but again, nothing. I kept calling for about two weeks, only to find out the manager was on vacation, which I had no idea about since she never informed me.

Eventually, someone gave me the phone number of another manager, and thankfully, I finally got a response. Apparently, there had been a mix-up, and I was told to reapply. I did, but this time I used a different email address because my original one wasn‚Äôt working with the system for some reason.

On my first day, while I was completing paperwork with the temporary manager, he noticed my information wasn‚Äôt showing up in the system. I explained that I had to create a new account using a different email, and once he tried the new one, it worked. He found my profile, and I assumed everything was sorted out.

For the first week and a half, I focused on completing my training modules and online assignments. After that, I was placed behind the bar. However, the person assigned to train me didn‚Äôt have much time to actually train me because I was scheduled for morning shifts‚Äîwhich, as you know, are the busiest. I work in a high-traffic location, so it‚Äôs been intense. Still, I‚Äôve been doing my best to keep up. I ask questions, request help when needed, and genuinely try to learn and improve. I don‚Äôt want to let my team down, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to disappoint customers.

The issue is, I was only shown how to brew coffee once. Despite that, I try to stay productive: I clean, restock, and take out the trash‚Äîeven though I have very sensitive skin and sun exposure affects me. I still do it because I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble, and I don‚Äôt like seeing things pile up. I also offer help depending on how busy things are, but I never just stand around doing nothing. The only time I might pause is when my feet and legs are really sore, and even then, I make sure it‚Äôs during slower moments when there are no customers in line.

So when my manager told me I ‚Äújust stand around‚Äù and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot doing enough,‚Äù it felt like a slap in the face‚Äîespecially since I‚Äôve seen other coworkers do the same things, and nothing is said to them. She also said I‚Äôm falling behind on training, which I understand, but the person training me simply doesn‚Äôt have the time to properly support me during our shifts. That‚Äôs why I often ask other coworkers for help. I try to be considerate and say, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm so sorry to interrupt‚Äîcan you help me real quick, please?‚Äù Most of the time, they‚Äôre understanding, but I can tell they‚Äôre sometimes frustrated. I try not to take it personally, but it still makes me feel like a burden.

Today, I had a conversation with my manager, and she said I‚Äôm not doing enough, that I‚Äôm behind, and that in her 20 years with Starbucks, she‚Äôs never met someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to brew coffee. That really hurt. It‚Äôs not my fault, and I‚Äôve been trying my best. On top of that, I still haven‚Äôt received my first paycheck, and the onboarding issue still hasn‚Äôt been fully resolved.

I ended up crying a bit today. I‚Äôve been trying so hard‚Äîtaking extra shifts, staying a little late, doing my best. I told my trainer what happened, and he actually apologized. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for not training you enough. It‚Äôs just hard with the morning rush and so many responsibilities.‚Äù He also mentioned that our manager has very high standards and can be intense, and encouraged me to keep doing my best, assuring me it will get better with time.

I told my manager the same thing, she dismissed it and said, ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs Starbucks for you. No more excuses. You need to keep up and finish your training.‚Äù Like what????

To make matters worse, I stayed longer today to help with coverage because other coworkers didn‚Äôt show up. We even had to close the caf√© and disable mobile orders‚Äîagain.

Oh, and she told me I need to reapply..AGAIN. I‚Äôm honestly so sick of this. I‚Äôm frustrated, disappointed, and just exhausted. I had a feeling this would happen, but it still hurts. I‚Äôm seriously considering quitting.

Today, I came close to having a panic attack at work‚Äîfor the first time in a long time. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

Also, I think I forgot to mention this earlier: I called the Starbucks Partner Hotline the other day, and the representative told me that my partner number isn‚Äôt working. She said it‚Äôs strange that I‚Äôm not in the system but still being scheduled to work. That likely explains why I haven‚Äôt received a paycheck yet. She advised me to inform my manager and have her call them, which I did‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt know if she ever followed up‚Ä¶Thank goodness I made that call when I did. Sigh. So yeah should I just quit my job? :(

There's a small coffee shop near me, ""The Daily Grind,"" that wanted to offer merchandise but didn't want the typical mass-produced stuff. They partnered with several local artists ‚Äì a potter, a woodworker, and a textile designer.

The potter created unique ceramic mugs with the coffee shop's logo subtly incorporated into the design. The woodworker crafted small wooden stands for pour-over coffee makers, again using the logo burnished into the wood. And the textile designer made reusable coffee filters and tote bags featuring original, nature-inspired patterns with the shop's colors.

What's interesting is that these weren't just logo-slapped items. The artists maintained their own styles, resulting in beautifully crafted, one-of-a-kind products that reflected the coffee shop's commitment to quality and community. Sales went up considerably, not just from the merchandise itself, but also from the increased foot traffic of people curious about the collaboration. They've basically created walking advertisements for the shop, and supported local artists in the process. has anyone seen similar examples of triumphant collaborations between businesses and artists?

   A description: Mr. Tycho is a stuffed fox doll that was created by Mr. Heart during one of his lengthy self-isolating moments; something he frequently fell in and out of following his experience in APATHY.

   Being the Moon‚Äôs incarnation, Mr. Heart had the elusive ability of Cosmic Intuition; while not being the Moon in his current state, he did have cosmic knowledge of alternative realities, and from a creeping conversation with the cosmos themselves he had suddenly sprung into fearsome motivation to replicate the ideas of a creature he could not source.

   (TW: Needles) Via condensing packed moonlight into the shape of a small, sapient brain and an active, beating heart, Heart had woven a form to stitch said organs into. Realising such a beast would require a syrup of life, the half >!pinched a contraption from within spilt moonlight and his spare sewing supplies; pricking and piercing his scarred skin and slowly draining his violet fluids until the doll‚Äôs body had been accurately fed.!< Idle momentarily, it then sprung to life.

   Dubbed ‚Äú(Mr. Tycho)‚Äù, Tycho wasn‚Äôt much for conversation, lacking a maw to speak with (as guided within his blueprints) but had plenty of room in his pointed ears to listen with. Heart found kinship with the little creature, understanding how baffling it was to suddenly be thrust into existence; surrounded by entities unalike you, unbitten into the world with a core purpose and job dissimilarly to yourself; he‚Äôd even found himself almost replicating his own Host‚Äôs instincts to instruct and protect the little beast, but couldn‚Äôt hold back a powerful sense of love for it, either.

   Heart spent longer hours in his room, shorter hours productive in meaningful ways. Talking with the little beast had become apart of most of his day; playing little games with it, reading it his many books, scrolling social media and explaining things to the doll beside him. Tycho hadn‚Äôt understood much, but it was clear he had the intent to listen.

   Sometimes, Heart would take Tycho out for a fly. Having crafted a small carrier to attach to his back or chest, Heart soared the lands of the Mindscape, Tycho in-stride below him; he‚Äôd rambled about the flowers he was in-charge of tending to, walked the black baysides while narrating the history of those beaches, played hide and seek within the biomes.

   He‚Äôd even been daring enough to hop the Mindscape‚Äôs bus stop and walk among humans with the little thing; his favourite coffee shops just assumed it was a weird marvel of technology, the markets assumed it was a costumed pet. Care was foreign in Heart‚Äôs head in this moment; he had a friend. One who cared.

   It was almost perfect, until Heart had one day come home to Mind within his room; the daylight-cloaked machine had a habit of snatching unwashed clothes that Heart neglected to lend over.

   ‚Äú(no! no! get out!)‚Äù

   ‚Äú[GET OUT?]‚Äù

   Like a rolling eclipse, the half tackled his brother, wrestling his precious doll from out of his irony hands. Mind then stood, stunned, as Heart cradled his precious thing and smoothed its fluffy fur with a paw.

   Heart cradled Tycho in his arms, ushering apologies under breaths of shushing for his sudden cruelty and profanity.

   Then, he heard Soul‚Äôs voice.

   And words of betrayal.

Well now I‚Äôm trying to use a finer grind to get a longer extraction but that‚Äôs when Sage decides to stall at around 10 seconds after building up the pressure.

*Joy*

I was staring at myself in the mirror when I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I was dressed in an ordinary gray hoodie paired with my favorite jeans and white sneakers. My long silky chestnut brown hair flowed freely below my shoulders, providing a suitable cover if ever I needed to hide my face.

I sighed. The idea was to blend in and not stand out, but I still had marks on my face which even make-up couldn't hide.

It has been over a year, but I was far from calling myself fully recovered. There were still noticeable marks on my face, although I can say there has been a stark improvement.

At least I still had my aquamarine eyes. It was the only feature I had that I could still call beautiful.

""Sweetie, breakfast is ready,"" my mom said, opening the door to my room. She was already dressed, ready to go to the hospital where she worked. She was wearing pink scrubs and white sneakers, her long brown hair was fixed into a neat bun while her face was devoid of make-up.

""Okay, Mom,"" I said, taking one last look at myself in the mirror. It was my first day at university and I was nervous. Scratch that. I was absolutely freaking out!

Noticing my distress, my mom walked up to me and gave me reassuring hug.

""Honey, I know you're nervous, but look how much you've improved. It has only been a little over a year and you're looking like yourself again,"" she said, peering into my eyes. ""But if you aren't ready, we can ask the dean to-""

""No, Mom. It's now or never. I need to put high school behind me and move on or I'll never be able to move on,"" I said. ""Anyway, I look so hideous, no boy is ever going to try and touch me. They'll probably throw up at the mere thought."" The reassuring expression on my mom's face instantly turned to sadness.

""Honey, I'm so sorry this had to happen to you, but look at the bright side, you've been given a second chance. Come on."" She put her arm around my shoulders and guided me to the door. ""You don't want to be late for your first day of school.""

I picked up my backpack and followed my mother to the kitchen. Since I still had problems going up and down the stairs, my parents made the small office space on the ground level of our small townhouse into my temporary bedroom.

""Here comes my college student. You got everything with you?"" My Dad asked before taking a sip of his coffee.

""Yep,"" I answered, making myself a bowl of cereal. My dad heard the nervousness in my voice and placed a loving hand on top of mine.

""Your mom and I, we are really proud of you, Joy. You've overcome so much so quickly. When I was your age, it took me a while to get myself together when your grandparents died."" My dad sighed and leaned back in his chair. ""I wish things were different, but we need to deal with the cards we've been dealt with. All of us together.""

""I know, Dad. I wish things were different too. Don't worry about me. I'll be just fine,"" I said before I began eating my cereal.

I glanced at my dad. He now had more white in his hair than ever before. He lost a ton of weight; his once round belly was much smaller, his face and arms much leaner. The stress of moving away from his home town and caring for his 'brutally raped' daughter showed.

""Since Mom has an early shift, I'll be driving you to school,"" my dad said, picking his keys up from the kitchen counter while I washed my empty cereal bowl.

""Sure, Dad.""

My anxiety grew as I sat quietly in the car while my dad drove me to school. I haven't been out with students my age ever since my assault that night at the spring formal of my junior year in high school at New Salem, North Dakota. My parents and I moved to California after that in the hopes of a second chance in life.

I was homeschooled my senior year while I underwent a series of surgeries to restore my face. I actually felt like this massive science project every time I went under the knife. But after each surgery, I noticed there was a huge improvement from before which gave me hope. At least now, I can look at myself in the mirror and not gag from seeing my reflection.

My dad parked next to my building and gave me a kiss on my cheek. I gingerly exited his SUV, so I wouldn't put too much pressure on my once broken leg. Although my leg was declared healed by my doctor, it still hurt a bit, so I walked with a slight limp. My doctor assured me it would go away in time and I will walk again like nothing ever happened.

""I'll pick you up at this exact same spot, sweetie,"" my dad called out to me from his car window.

""Sure, Dad. I'll see you after class. Love you!"" I said, waving goodbye.

I covered my head and my face with my hoodie before walking to my building. Although my face was improving, I was still self-conscious of my appearance. My cheeks were riddled with scars, blemishes and discolorations.

I know people would try and ask me what happened to me if they notice my face. And because I didn't want to relive that particular moment in my life every single time I was asked, I decided it was best if I hide my face as much as I could.

As I walked along the campus sidewalk, I saw a group of students, hanging out near a big tree. There were three boys and two girls. One girl I remembered from my admissions interview. She was part of the student council who handled student affairs and helped faculty with admissions. As I passed by, the girl beside her called the attention of the three boys with them and pointed at me.

I know I should have looked away, but I couldn't help, but stare. They were the most gorgeous young men I have ever seen in my life. If I had thought Noah was handsome, these guys were downright beautiful. I could think of no other word to describe them.

While that girl laughed at my appearance, the three boys looked at me with this horrible expression on their faces. I felt so embarrassed, I quickly looked away.

*Serves you right*,¬†*Joy*.¬†*You aren't suppose to stare at people*.¬†*It's rude*.

I sighed. Well, at least I had something nice to look at on campus.

I walked into my building, found my room and picked a chair off to the corner where I could hide from everyone else. I made myself comfortable and waited for our professor to arrive.

More students began entering the classroom five minutes before class was expected to start. Our professor also walked in, briefcase and coffee in hand. He was a tall man with gray hair and glasses, looking quite tired. While I studied our professor, I didn't notice the three boys behind him. Their eyes locked with mine as our professor walked quickly to his desk.

Oh my gosh! It was the three gorgeous boys from earlier! They were in my class!

All three of them were the same height, had the same dark hair and muscular build. I quickly assumed they were brothers because they resembled each other in a way.

But they had different colored eyes. One had startling blue eyes, the other had rare honey-colored eyes and the last one had light brown eyes, the color of dark caramel. Their parents must be really good-looking to have a brood of gorgeous men in the family.

The one with dark caramel eyes suddenly gave me a small smile. I quickly lowered my head, blushing.

*No*,¬†*Joy*.¬†*That smile wasn't for you*.

I surreptitiously glanced upward to check if that smile was for me, but to my dismay, they had already taken their seats. I slowly turned my head to scan the people at the back, but I couldn't find them.

I sighed. Well, it was time for me to focus on the lecture rather than boys. When I was in high school, I focused on boys during my junior year and look where it got me.

""Sebastian, will you please stop crowding me!"" A deep manly voice growled right behind me.

I turned to look at who it was and I unexpectedly found the three of them seated behind me!

I quickly faced forward and sat up straight, deciding it was best to just look at my professor for the rest of the period.

But it was so hard to concentrate knowing they were seated behind me.

# CHAPTER 2 The Girl With The Limp

*Xavier*

First day of our freshmen year in college and there were so many girls! Sure most of them would probably flock to Sebastian and Cristos, but I only needed one. The one girl who would make me feel complete.

We were talking to a couple of girls under one of the trees near the entrance to our building. Malia and Alison were both upper classmen. Malia, who was currently part of the student council, happened to be a cousin of Sebastian's.

""Sure, Dad. I'll see you after class. Love you,"" I heard a sing-song type of voice say. To me, her voice was so beautiful and so rare...like music to my ears. I quickly scanned the students near the parking area, desperately looking for the voice's source, when I saw her limping along the campus sidewalk.

""Check out Frankenstein,"" the girl named Alison said, pointing to the girl limping towards us. Alison wasn't a close friend of Malia's, but since she had her sights on Sebastian, she decided to hang with us before our classes started.

As the girl with the limp walked by us, she caught us looking at her. Usually when girls catch us staring at them, they usually look away, blushing. But she stared as we stared and for the first time, I felt small under her gaze.

""Alison, you don't know what you're talking about,"" Malia said sternly. ""That girl has had it pretty rough.""

""What do you mean? Did she get hit by a bus or something?"" Alison said, laughing. ""Because she definitely looks like she got hit by a bus.""

""Alison, you better shut up or I'll make sure you look like you got hit by a bus come tomorrow,"" I said, annoyed. Alison stared at me with her mouth open, shocked that I had just threatened her. I grimaced and pushed her aside. She wasn't part of our group anyway. I needed to focus on the girl with the limp.

""Malia, what happened to her?"" I asked, impatiently. I couldn't believe something terrible could happen to someone with such a pretty voice.

""It's not my place to tell you, but she was assaulted,"" Malia said, sighing, the sadness in her eyes as she watched the girl slowly walk by us.

*Assaulted*?!¬†*What*?! I guess my face reflected the horror I felt, because the girl quickly lowered her face.

""What do you mean by assaulted, Malia?"" Sebastian asked, his face turning dark.

""Sebastian, I'm sorry. I told you it's not my place to tell any of you,"" Malia replied.

""Did it happen here?"" Cristos asked.

""I don't know, Cristos,"" Malia answered. ""She applied for a scholarship and because of her ordeal, admissions gave her a full scholarship. Actually, when she came in for the interview, her face was much worse than that and she was on crutches. So far, she's healing rather nicely and she can walk on her own now. Guys, if she is in one of your classes, don't say or mention anything about it. I think she and her family are in hiding. You know what? Don't do anything stupid either. I'm warning you boys.""

When we got to class, we were surprised to find her seated near the corner ready to take down notes. Instead of entering our classroom, Cristos walked up to a bunch of girls standing near the door.

""Hey. Do you know that girl's name?"" Cristos asked casually, discreetly pointing at the girl with the limp.

""Yeah, Joy Taylor,"" one of the girls replied.

""Do any of you know what happened to her?"" Sebastian asked.

""The teaching assistant said she was assaulted. That's all we know. If you want to know more, I guess you have to ask her,"" the same girl answered.

""Thanks,"" I said and pulled Sebastian and Cristos off to the side. ""Sebastian, ask through the grapevine if they know of anything about that girl. If you find the motherfuckers, I want to know. Nothing goes unpunished.""

""Will do,"" Sebastian answered. ""What will you do if ever I find the assholes who did this to her?""

""I will break every bone in their bodies before I put two in their heads,"" I answered truthfully. ""Look at her. How could anyone do something like that to her?""

""I don't know, but it looks like she made someone very angry,"" Cristos said as he studied her from afar. ""The amount of injuries is tantamount to rage. But look at her eyes. There's a sadness in them. Whatever happened to Joy Taylor, she didn't deserve it.""

""My thoughts exactly,"" I said, agreeing with him. ""I want to know what happened to her. Let's use all our connections and found out what we can.""

""Heads up, guys. Our professor is here,"" Sebastian mumbled, discreetly pointing to a tall man entering our classroom. He had white hair and glasses and was holding a briefcase and a cup of coffee. We followed him inside, pausing to find chairs so we could sit beside each other.

I caught her staring at us and so I decided to give her a small smile. I thought she would smile back at me, but she quickly hid her face. I sighed. I wanted to help her, but I just didn't know how.

Cristos nudged and pointed at some empty seats behind her. Things were looking up.

We quickly took our seats behind her. I wanted to introduce myself, but she seemed skittish. Of course...who wouldn't be skittish after being hurt like that?

Sebastian's leg kept bumping into mine as he sat, spread eagle, like he was airing out his big balls.

""Sebastian, will you please stop crowding me,"" I told him, while pushing his leg away.

She suddenly turned to look at us and was surprised to see us sitting behind her. I was about to say hi, but she quickly turned away. I hoped she would turn around again, but through the whole lecture, she ignored us.

It was my first time to feel invisible... and it hurt like hell.

After class, I sadly watched her walk away. I was about to follow her when Cristos stopped me.

""Xavier, let's give her some space. It's only the first day of school. Don't worry, an opportunity will present itself. When she needs us, we'll be there for her. Right now, let's allow her to adjust,"" he said.

""I agree,"" Sebastian said. ""Let's focus on finding out who did this to her."" He whipped out his phone from his pocket and dialed.

""Capo De Luca, I need you and the other capos to do some research for me,"" Sebastian said. ""No, it's not for school. Well, it is...sort of. I want you to ask around if anyone knows of an assault on an eighteen year old girl, tall and slender with brown hair and blue-green eyes. If you find anything, and I mean anything, you tell me.""

""No, De Luca, don't touch them if you do. Xavier will be in charge of that,"" Sebastian added before hanging up.

I smiled sinisterly. I would make them pay for what that did to her.",1,1747384245.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged‚Äîa message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1knvrd5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knvrd5,I did a cupping session at home! Very happy with the observations.,"So, I purchased two types of beans from Bharat Coffee Depot, Vadodara, based on recommendations of a person in the comments of recent posts. To clarify, this isn‚Äôt me trying to hold the guy liable for anything. I‚Äôm just providing context. 
Thus, I ended up having 5 types of beans at home, detailed below. 
1. Fraction 9 Crimson Port
2. Fraction 9 Winter Berries
3. Chelvies Monsooned Malabar
4. Bharat Coffee AAA plantation
5. Bharat Coffee W Specialty 


I used a 1:17 ratio with 10 gms of grounds with 170 gms water just off boil. I ground the beans a bit finer than pour over grind. Lastly, gave the grounds 4 minutes of brewing before removing the floating froth. 

Now, I‚Äôll categorise the post into sections. 

Specific observations and reviews of the coffees:-

1. Bharat AAA plantation
The beans are old. Roast date was claimed to be 9th May. It clearly isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs nothing of note to these beans, and to the brew they brew. It can work for a pour over if you‚Äôve nothing else to use, but it‚Äôs not worth a buy even at the lower cost that he sells them at. No depth to the taste, no tasting notes to note, just bland coffee. 

2. BhƒÅrat W specialty. 
The ‚Äòspecialty‚Äô was burnt away while roasting these apparently. Seems roasted for espresso? I don‚Äôt understand to be honest. Burnt, bitter, with a slight caramelly-alcoholic like note in the finish. 

3. Chelvies Monsooned Malabar. 
I use these beans for my cold brews that are loved by my wife, while I myself prefer brewing on a V60 daily. I see why these beans are so well suited for cold brew. Strong coffee with a slight bitter finish. Very well rounded taste profile. The strength and well rounded nature of these beans are apt for a daily cold brew, and I sometimes add slices of Malta for a few hours so give it some zing. 

4. Fraction 9 Winter Berries. 
These are one of the two beans that I use for my V60 brews daily. It‚Äôs a light-medium roast, with mellow acidity and airy profile. It‚Äôs a good daily. It smells chocolatey and slightly sweet. While the cup is hot, it tastes decently rounded and slightly acidic. However, once it cools down the body of the brew seems lacklustre to me. It feels slightly hollow and empty, or ‚Äòflat‚Äô if you will. The acidity remains, but the chocolatey roundedness disappears. There‚Äôs also a lack of sweetness that would lend balance to the brew. Thus it ends up feeling a bit flat and unsatisfying due to lack of finish. Yet, it‚Äôs a good bean and one won‚Äôt find it difficult to consume and finish these beans in any way. 

5. Fraction 9 Crimson Port. 
This is the star of today‚Äôs session, and my favourite of all these. The experience starts right in the grinding phase, where it smells fragrant, floral, and fruity bright. The brew tastes tart, juicy, bright with a smooth light finish that has a slight vacant sweetness. The tartness can be compared to the way an ‚Äòamla‚Äô-gooseberry tastes in terms of mouthfeel. It is a juicy celebration compared to the standard Winter Berries brew. Has better balance with the enhanced acidity and sweetness over the previous one, along with more interesting notes to taste and sniff. 



General Observations from the Session:-

While it‚Äôs a bit disheartening to see that my latest purchases have been unworthy, I can‚Äôt say the same about the session. I never compared the beans I have side by side, until today. I now have better realisation of my own coffee choices, and value the fraction9 beans more. I see why they cost what they cost, and how the described notes translate to the notes I sniff and taste. All in all, it was an excellent exercise in a hobby I really enjoy being a part of. Excellent use of time. 

I appreciate you taking the time to read, and implore you to do a cupping session at your own home with your collection. Do send me pictures!

The quick catch-ups, the late-night voice notes, the spontaneous coffees between meetings‚Äîthey matter.

The laughter. The real talk. The reminders of who we are beyond the hustle.

1knvm64,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knvm64,Have I (tree surgeon) killed my own tree?,"My company has planted 100's of trees with a 99% success rate + after care etc 

I planted my Autumn blaze (Red Maple x Silver Maple) about 5 years ago. Bought as a 3m tall specimen 10-12cm dbh standard form. Its now 5m tall and 16-18cm dbh 

Its put on a lot of growth (no shock growth), and the trunk has thickened nicely, crown is a lot more dense too. 

However it lost its leaves early, around early September time, where as it would mornally be late October. It's a slow process on this tree, once the leaves turn red they take 3-4 weeks to fully come off, this was the same this year, no sudden drop as such, just early. 

Its now mid May and whilst it's usually a late bloomer (April time). There are buds and the usual red tipped young growth. 

It was correctly planted, had water bags whenever we had sustained dry hot weather (definitely not over or under watered) 

However I'm pretty sure its toast - buds when squeezed show some green inside, but not enough. 

I've just cut a branch and whilst it isn't brittle, it will bend but its very dry and seems lighter than it should, when I peel back the bark there is no greenery as you would expect on the cambium. 

HOW tf have a killed my own tree which has had nothing but care and a nice tree pit 

I did glyphsate the block paving next to it but none got on the leaves, and it doesn't really work through soil. 

Cats including mine use the bark as a litter tray and my cats ashes were spread in there + some infrequent coffee byproduct thrown in there. 

Nitrate levels too high and killed the feeder roots? The lawn has had treatment over the years but I'd like to think its far enough away but could be wrong.
