1pvz5wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pvz5wq/aita_for_pressing_charges_after_my_fiancé_spent/,"AITA for pressing charges after my fiancé spent $17K of my money on his affair partner, then his mom begged me to drop them?","I checked my bank account this morning and saw a $9,642 charge to some luxury resort in Miami and my fiancé just shrugged and said ""what's mine is yours babe, so what's yours is mine.""

The wedding is in three weeks. Was in three weeks.

I only found out because my card got declined buying groceries. Standing there at the checkout with a line behind me, face burning while the cashier ran it twice. I called the bank from the parking lot and they read off the charges. Four nights at some five-star resort. Bottle service at three different clubs. A fucking jet ski rental. All charged Thursday through Sunday while he was supposedly camping with his buddies from college.

I drove straight to his place. He was on the couch playing video games.

""Did you seriously spend almost ten grand of my money without asking me?""

He didn't even pause his game. ""It's our money now, isn't it? We're getting married.""

""We're not married yet. That's my savings account. For the wedding.""

""Yeah, and the guys were ragging on me for not doing a proper bachelor party. What was I supposed to do?""

I just stared at him. ""You were supposed to ask me first. Or use your own money.""

He finally looked at me. ""My money's tied up in investments. And you make more than me anyway, so I don't see what the big deal is.""

The big deal was I'd been saving for two years. The big deal was we'd agreed on a budget and I'd been covering most of it because his ""investments"" never seemed to pay out. The big deal was he'd stolen my debit card from my wallet while I was sleeping.

""I'm calling the bank,"" I said. ""I'm reporting it as fraud.""

That's when his whole face changed. He stood up fast. ""You're not doing that. That's insane.""

""You stole my card.""

""I didn't steal anything, we live together, we're engaged."" His voice got louder. ""You report that and you'll fuck up my credit, mess with my job, you'll ruin everything over nothing.""

""Over nothing? Jake, that's—""

Wait. Fuck. I used his name. Whatever. I'm upset.

""Over nothing?"" I corrected. ""That's nine thousand dollars.""

""That you'll get back when we combine finances anyway.""

I left. Called the bank from my car and reported every charge as unauthorized. They flagged it for investigation and issued me a new card. My hands were shaking the whole time.

He called me seventeen times that night. I didn't answer. Then he showed up at my apartment at midnight, pounding on the door, yelling about how I was destroying his life over a ""loan"" he was gonna pay back.

I called the cops. They made him leave but said it was a civil matter, they couldn't do anything about the money.

The next day I went to the venue and canceled everything. Lost the deposit but I didn't care. Called my family, called his family, told everyone the wedding was off. His mom called me crying, begging me to reconsider, saying he'd made a mistake but he loved me.

Then the fraud investigation finished.

The bank investigator called me Thursday. Said they'd found something. My fiancé had apparently been using my card for months. Not just the Miami trip. There were charges going back seven months that I'd never noticed because they were small. Dinners with someone named ""Em"" in the transaction details. Hotel rooms. Flowers sent to an address I didn't recognize.

Seventeen thousand dollars total.

""We'll need you to file a police report,"" the investigator said. ""This is beyond our fraud department now.""

I filed it. Gave them everything. Screenshots of him admitting he took my card. The bank records. Everything.

He was arrested Tuesday. Turns out felony fraud charges are a thing when it's over a certain amount, and with his priors for writing bad checks in college, the DA actually wanted to prosecute.

But here's the part that really killed me.

His affair partner contacted me on Instagram. Some girl named Emily who'd met him at his gym. She'd seen his arrest in the local news and put two and two together. Sent me screenshots of their messages going back nine months. He'd told her he was single. Told her he was taking her to Miami for her birthday. Paid for everything with my fucking money.

She said she had no idea about me. Sent me pictures of them together, pictures he'd cropped me out of from his own Instagram to show her. In one of them you can literally see the edge of my hand because he'd cropped so carelessly.

I met with her for coffee yesterday. She cried. I didn't. I think I'm all out of tears.

She's cooperating with the prosecutor too now. Apparently using someone's stolen financial information to impress your affair partner adds something called ""aggravating circumstances.""

His public defender is pushing for a plea deal. My lawyer says he's looking at eighteen months minimum, restitution, and a felony record. His ""investments"" turned out to be a trading account with $340 in it. His mom called me again, begging me to drop the charges, saying I'm ruining his entire future.

I blocked her.

The thing is, some of my friends are saying I went too far. That I should've just broken up with him, not gotten the police involved. That he made a stupid mistake and didn't deserve jail time. My cousin said I'm being vindictive and that ""couples counseling could've fixed this.""

I gave back the ring. Told him to sell it for his legal fees.

Now I'm wondering if I overreacted. AITAH?

1pvz44c,https://www.reddit.com/r/JobXDubai/comments/1pvz44c/hiring_listing_hunter_sage_real_estate_dubai/,"[Hiring] Listing Hunter — Sage Real Estate, Dubai (Remote)","# Listing Hunter — Sage Real Estate, Dubai (Remote)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubairealestate/?f=flair_name%3A%22News%20%F0%9F%93%8A%22)

# About Sage

Sage Real Estate is a new Dubai-based agency focused exclusively on luxury properties starting from 3 million AED.

We're building something different. Our priority is helping end users find homes — people who will actually live in these properties, not flip them. We believe real estate should be about finding the right space for someone's life, not about speculation.

Here's an unpopular opinion: I don't believe real estate is a good investment vehicle. The Dubai market is flooded with investor-driven demand that has compromised build quality across the board. Developers cut corners because they know buyers won't live in these units — they'll rent them out or resell. The result? A city full of luxury finishes hiding mediocre construction. Sage exists to serve the people who actually care about where they live, and we want listings that reflect that standard.

# The Role: Listing Hunter

I'm looking for someone to do one thing only: bring listings to Sage.

No client meetings. No property viewings. No negotiations. No closing deals. Your job ends the moment the listing goes live on Bayut and Property Finder.

This is a pure business development role. You find property owners, convince them to list with us, handle the paperwork — and that's it. Our sales team takes over from there.

**Ideal candidate:** Someone who already has relationships with property owners in Dubai's luxury segment. If you have an existing network, this is very easy money. You're essentially monetizing contacts you already have.

# Compensation

**Base salary:** 2,500 AED/month

**Per-listing bonus** (paid after listing remains active for 3 months):

|Property Value|Open Listing|Exclusive Listing|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|3M – 5M AED|500 AED|1,000 AED|
|5M – 10M AED|1,500 AED|3,000 AED|
|10M+ AED|5,000 AED|10,000 AED|

Exclusives pay double because they're harder to get and more valuable to us. That said, I don't expect you to chase exclusives specifically — if they happen, great. If not, open listings are perfectly fine. I'm not building the compensation around exclusives as the goal.

# Working Conditions

* Fully remote — work from home, coffee shop, wherever
* Visa sponsorship and official employment available if needed
* 2-month probation period (minimum 5 listings required)
* Complete freedom in how you work — no scripts, no call quotas, no micromanagement. I don't care how you get listings, only that your methods are legal and ethical
* You decide your own hours and approach

# What I'm Looking For

I'm not hiring an employee. I'm looking for a partner who takes ownership of one function: bringing properties into the agency. Nothing more, nothing less.

If you have the network and want to turn it into income without the hassle of full-cycle sales, let's talk.

**DM me with:**

* Brief background
* Your experience in Dubai real estate (if any)
* Why this role interests you

No CV required. Just tell me why you'd be good at this.",1,1766736389.0,JobXDubai,0,1.0,False
1pvz2ij,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvz2ij,Muscleblaze Biozyme Performance Blue Tokai is miles ahead of all other coffee flavoured proteins.,"M29 here. 5ft 9, 77 kgs.

So, I’ve been on a higher protein routine lately (to get more shredded), and I keep buying coffee-flavoured whey only…cause me & my girlfriend we are hardcore caffeine addicts 😁

Honestly, MB has done exceptional with their blue tokai coffee blend in terms of taste, mixability, and digestion. Beats ATOM Cafe Latte and Nakpro Gold Whey (coffee) both.

It has that roasted notes closely similar to imported coffee beans, not overly sweet, and a veryy smooth mouthfeel. Also, mixes well in water and milk..and touchwood…I haven't felt any bloating till date in my last 20 days of use. Probably gonna stick to it for the next few months.

Nakpro Coffee is not horrible, but it feels more like plain whey with a light coffee hint. Texture can be a bit powdery, and the flavour is flatter, especially in water and idk why but it formed foams. Occasionally felt bloated too during this time. 

ATOM cost is less, does the job…but the mixability is not good even after 15 secs of vigorous shaking.  In milk it’s better, but still feels kind of flat and had a syrupy aftertaste now that I've tasted MB…not real real coffee like (coffee drinkers will know).

If I were to rank my overall experience I'd say **MB is 4.5** out of 5, **Nakpro is 3.6ish** and **ATOM is 3.**

1pvz0ff,https://i.redd.it/8uw5jmf89i9g1.jpeg,Built a simple self-hosted glucose tracker because spreadsheets weren’t cutting it,"I was recently diagnosed with Type 2 and quickly realized that bouncing between a glucose meter, notes, and spreadsheets wasn’t helping me understand patterns — just individual numbers.

I’m fairly techy, so I wanted something easy, visual, and under my control rather than another app or subscription.

So I built a small self-hosted glucose tracker using Flask + SQLite that runs locally on my PC and works on my phone browser.

What it does so far:
- Log glucose readings with editable date/time (fasting, post-meal auto-detected)
- Color-codes readings (green / yellow / red) so I don’t overreact to single numbers
- Logs meals with estimated carbs

Tracks meds:
- Metformin (daily)
- Ozempic (weekly, with a Thursday reminder)

Simple chart showing trends instead of noise
Everything stays local — no cloud, no accounts, no data sharing

Why I built it:
- Early treatment = a lot of fluctuation
I wanted trend awareness, not anxiety
- I didn’t want another subscription app or my health data floating around

It’s intentionally simple and still evolving (next up: rolling averages and symptom correlation), but it’s already helped me connect:
1. Meals → glucose
2. Med timing → stability
3. “Feeling off” → dehydration vs actual glucose issues

Disclaimer: I’m not a clinician, and this isn’t medical advice or a replacement for professional care. This is just a personal logging tool I use alongside guidance from my doctor, with the goal of understanding trends rather than making treatment decisions.

Not trying to sell anything — just sharing in case:
- Anyone else prefers self-hosted tools
- Anyone newly diagnosed feels overwhelmed by numbers
- Anyone wants a lightweight alternative to spreadsheets

1pvz02o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvz02o,Found My New Emotional Support Box — These Adorable Monster Boxes Are Pure Therapy,"Okay, I need to confess: I just bought a box. Not just any box. A monster box. And it’s already my new favorite thing on my desk.

I got one of these cute corrugated cardboard boxes with giant, innocent monster faces. At first, I thought it was just for decoration… but then I started using it as my “Happy Moments Jar.”

Every day, I scribble down one tiny thing that made me smile — a good coffee, a text from a friend, a cat nap, whatever. Toss it in the box. On bad days, I’ll pull out an old note, glance at the big, dumb, adorable eyes staring back at me… and somehow, my mood flips.

It’s ridiculous. It’s silly. And it works.

If you’re a fellow lover of all things kawaii, therapeutic, or just need a little visual serotonin boost on your desk — these are 100% worth it. They’re not just storage. They’re emotional support monsters.

Bonus: The design is so charming, I keep catching myself smiling at them even when I’m not putting notes in. 10/10 would recommend for anyone needing a daily dose of whimsy.

The morning of May 9 arrived without ceremony.That’s the part that bothers me most, even now. There was nothing special about it. No strange dreams. No storms pressing against the windows. No sense that the day was any different from the hundreds that came before it.Just heat.Early heat, already sitting heavy in the air like it had nowhere else to go. The kind that made the house feel smaller than it was. Ceiling fans hummed in every room, chopping the air into useless pieces, fighting a battle they were never going to win.I remember lying on the living room floor, my cheek pressed against the cool patch beneath the coffee table, tightening the strap on my backpack again even though I’d already done it twice. The fabric was worn thin where my fingers kept pulling at it. I didn’t need anything in the bag that badly. I just needed something to do with my hands.Charlotte leaned against my shoulder, quiet in the way she got when places felt wrong. Her fingers were curled into my sleeve, not tight enough to hurt, but firm. Anchoring herself.She didn’t say anything. She rarely did unless she had to.Mom moved through the room barefoot, stepping around open suitcases, folding clothes with quick, practiced motions. She’d packed and unpacked most of her life. Moving jobs. Moving apartments. Adjusting. She was good at it. Too good. You get good at things you don’t expect to last.Dad noticed the silence first.I didn’t understand that at the time. I just saw him pause with a shirt halfway folded in his hands, his eyes unfocusing like he’d heard something no one else had. Later, I’d recognize that look. That moment when the world didn’t quite line up with itself.Not peaceful silence.The other kind.The kind that makes you aware of your own breathing. Of the way your chest rises and falls without asking permission.James stood near the front door.He hadn’t sat down once since I’d woken up.He held his keys in his right hand, fingers clenched so tightly the metal bit into his skin. Every few seconds, he checked his watch. Then the door. Then the hallway that led deeper into the house. Like something might come walking out if he looked away for too long.I remember thinking he looked thinner than the last time I’d seen him. His clothes hung on him wrong, like they belonged to someone else now. There were dark circles under his eyes, deep enough to look permanent.“We should leave today,” James said.His voice cut through the hum of the fans like a blade.Dad didn’t look up. “Tomorrow morning’s fine.”James swallowed. I saw his jaw tighten, muscles jumping beneath the skin.“Today would be better.”Mom glanced over her shoulder, one eyebrow lifting slightly.









“The campsite isn’t going anywhere, James.”He tried to smile then. It didn’t work. It stretched thin across his face, fragile, like it might crack if anyone pushed it too far.Charlotte shifted beside me.“Ja… Ja—” she started.Her breath caught. She hated when everyone turned to look at her. You could see it in the way her shoulders tensed, in the way she leaned just a little closer to me. But she pushed through it anyway, stubborn in her own quiet way.“James… Mr. James…”I squeezed her hand, slow and steady.“…Op—Ophelia?” she finished.The room went still.Not dramatic stillness. No music cutting out. No sudden quiet like in movies.Just a pause so complete it felt deliberate.James froze.For half a second, I thought he might pretend he hadn’t heard her. Pretend the word hadn’t landed where it had. But then he exhaled, long and slow, like he’d been holding his breath since the question existed.“She’s not coming,” he said.His voice was calm.Too calm.Mom frowned gently. “Is she sick?”James nodded once. “Something like that.”Charlotte tilted her head, confused. “Bu—but… she a-always comes.”His fingers tightened around the keys. The metal clinked softly.“Not this time.”No one pushed further.You could feel it—the invisible w









A song you could hum without knowing the words. I bobbed my head to the rhythm, more out of habit than enjoyment. Charlotte sat beside me, knees tucked up, counting trees as they passed.“One… two… th—three…”Her voice snagged on the number. She stopped counting altogether and stared out the window, lips pressed tight.Mom noticed. She always did. “You okay, sweetheart?”Charlotte nodded too quickly.James turned the volume up.Dad watched him from the passenger seat. Every few minutes, James adjusted the rearview mirror—not to check traffic, but to look at us. At me. At Charlotte. Each time, he looked away again just as fast, jaw clenched, like he’d touched something hot.“You sure this is the right way?” Mom asked after a while.James didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”The road narrowed. Asphalt cracked and faded, giving way to gravel that popped beneath the tires. Mom checked her phone, then frowned.“No network,” she said lightly. “Figures.”James didn’t smile.The forest began without warning.One moment there was sky on eith













“What’s its name?”James’s grip tightened.“I don’t know.”It was a lie.Dad closed his eyes. Images pressed against the backs of his eyelids—blurred, incomplete. Blood where there shouldn’t have been blood. Shapes that didn’t make sense until they did. Screams that ended too quickly.“We should turn back,” he said.James shook his head. “No.”“You said it was close.”“It is.”“James.”James’s voice cracked. “I said no.”The car rolled forward, deeper into the trees.Charlotte pressed her face into my shoulder, hiding. I wrapped an arm around her, the excitement I’d felt earlier gone now, replaced with something quieter and sharper.The forest felt closer. Not physically—something else. As if the distance between here and there had folded in on itself.As if we had already crossed a line.Far ahead, between the trees, something pale stood very still.James didn’t slow down.Dad said nothing.Some warnings come too late.The campsite appeared suddenly, as if the forest had decided—at the last possible moment—to allow it.A clea









“Night comes fast here.”“How do you know?” I asked.James didn’t answer.We worked in near silence. Mom laid out food. I helped Dad with the tent. Charlotte stayed close, never letting go of my hand. Every so often, James stopped what he was doing and looked toward the trees, listening.Dad noticed.“What are you waiting for?” he asked.James blinked. “Nothing.”A lie. Again.By late afternoon, the light began to change. Shadows stretched longer than they should have. The trees seemed closer now, their presence pressing in from all sides. Mom tried to lighten the mood, pointing out how cool the air felt, how peaceful it was.No one laughed.Dad walked to the edge of the clearing. The forest began just a few steps away. He stared into it, past the first line of trunks, trying to see how deep it went.The trees swallowed distance.“Albert,” Mom called. “Don’t wander off.”“I won’t,” he said.He didn’t tell her that last time, someone had said the same thing.We lit the campfire as the sun dipped below the trees. Flames cra









Not close enough to point at.Not far enough to pretend it wasn’t real.Heavy.It hit the ground with a dull, wet thud, like something large dropping onto soil that had already been softened by rain. The earth shuddered beneath it, just enough for me to feel it through the thin fabric of the tent floor.Charlotte sat up beside me with a sharp intake of breath.“Leo,” she whispered.Her voice was small. Tight. She already knew.I hadn’t slept. Not really. I’d been lying there listening to the quiet, to the absence of everything that was supposed to be there. Insects. Wind. The distant movement of animals. All of it missing, like the forest had decided to hold its breath.Another sound followed.Slower this time.Dragging.Something scraped against the ground, leaving a noise that made my teeth ache. I could hear it clearly now—not just one movement, but a rhythm. Patient. Deliberate.Dad pushed himself upright in the tent across from ours. I heard the fabric shift, his breath catching as the sound registered.Mom stirred







They didn’t emerge all at once. They simply… appeared. As if they’d been standing there the whole time, waiting for the light to reach them.They were tall.Far too tall.Each one stood easily over seven feet, their bodies stretched wrong, proportions skewed in ways my brain refused to settle into. Where arms should have been, there was nothing. Just smooth, unfinished flesh. Where faces should have been, there were no features at all. No eyes. No mouths.Only legs.Long. Thick. Muscled.And soaked in blood.They stood at the edge of the clearing, unmoving.Waiting.Charlotte screamed.One of the figures tilted its head.Not in curiosity.In recognition.Its leg dragged forward, slow and deliberate, carving a shallow line through the dirt.James sobbed. The sound tore out of him, raw and animal. “Please,” he cried. “I brought her. I did what you wanted. Please.”Dad turned on him. “James… what did you do?”James didn’t look at him. He couldn’t. “I thought…” His voice broke. “I thought it was over.”The second figure stepped













“The car!”The clearing burst back into view just as something slammed into the vehicle.Glass exploded outward in a spray of glittering shards. The windshield caved inward in a single, crushing impact that punched straight through to the back window. Metal screamed as the car rocked violently, then went still.Charlotte screamed into Mom’s shoulder.Something inside me went cold.“No,” Dad whispered. “It’s done.”The figures were closer now. Close enough that I could hear the sound their legs made against the ground—wet, dragging, wrong.Mom turned to Dad.He didn’t need to say anything.She already knew.Mom set Charlotte down gently, hands shaking as she brushed dirt from her knees. She pressed her forehead to Charlotte’s, breathing her in like she was trying to memorize her.“Close your eyes,” she whispered. “Both of you.”“No,” I said, panic ripping through me. “Mom—”She smiled.It was small. Steady. Final.“Take your sister,” she said. “Listen to your father.”Dad grabbed her wrist. “Lily—”“They repeat,” she said sof













Fire.I turned toward it.The car was a ruin. Metal twisted inward like it had been punched by something impossibly strong. Glass covered the ground in dull, broken constellations. Flames licked weakly from beneath the hood, coughing smoke into the trees.Near it, a figure knelt.James.He was [alive.One](http://alive.One) arm ended at the shoulder, wrapped tight in torn fabric. Blood had soaked through and dried dark against his shirt. His face looked gray, emptied out, his eyes too big in his skull. When he saw us, something in him collapsed.“Leo,” he croaked. “Charlotte.”Charlotte flinched at the sound of his voice and pressed her face harder into my chest.James struggled to his feet, swaying. “They’re gone,” he said. “For now.”I stared past him, searching the tree line. “My mom and dad—”James closed his eyes.“I’m sorry,” he whispered.The forest didn’t answer.James led us away from the clearing, staying close to the road like he was afraid to step too far in either direction. Dawn crept in slowly, a pale, fragile light that felt











At night she dreamed of silence so deep it rang, like pressure building behind her ears. She woke shaking, gasping for air, and James would sit with her until morning without saying a word.I never dreamed.I remembered.Years passed anyway. Life does that, whether you’re ready or not. School. Work. Houses that didn’t feel like homes. Small moments of laughter that arrived unexpectedly and left just as fast, like they weren’t sure they were allowed to stay.Sometimes, when the wind was just right, Charlotte would stop whatever she was doing.Once, years later, she stood at the kitchen sink washing dishes. The window was open just enough to let the evening air in. The scent of pine drifted through the screen, faint but unmistakable.She didn’t turn around.“Th-they’re n-not h-hunting,” she said softly.I nodded from the table. “They repeat.”James heard that once.He paused in the doorway, one hand resting against the frame. He didn’t ask how she knew. He didn’t ask what she meant.Some knowledge isn’t meant to be spoke

**Reddit Comments Stats:** 95% positive sentiment based on 113 mentions (Rank: 100) - exceptional approval and maximum ranking for the legendary coffee maker.

**Perfect Coffee Every Time:** This pump-free coffee maker heats water to the correct temperature for optimal coffee extraction. The Moccamaster's precision brewing method ensures consistent results - no guesswork, no temperature fluctuations. This is what coffee enthusiasts mean when they talk about ""proper extraction"" - water at exactly the right temperature contacting grounds for exactly the right time.

**Brew-Volume Selector:** Switch for brewing half or full carafes means you can make 5 cups or 10 cups with proper extraction either way. This flexibility prevents waste when you don't need a full pot while maintaining coffee quality. Many coffee makers struggle with half pots - the Moccamaster handles both perfectly.

**Easy to Use:** Brews a full 40 oz pot of coffee in 4-6 minutes using one switch. This simplicity is deceptive - behind that single switch is precision engineering that controls temperature, flow rate, and extraction time perfectly. Just add water and grounds, flip the switch, and wait for exceptional coffee.

**Quiet and Safe:** The Moccamaster Select quietly brews your coffee and automatically turns off after 100 minutes. The quiet operation means no loud grinding or pumping sounds in the morning. The auto-shutoff provides peace of mind and safety.

**40 Ounce / 1.25L Capacity:** Ten cups (40 oz / 1.25L) is the perfect size for households - enough for multiple people or several cups throughout the morning without making excessive amounts. The glass carafe sits on a hotplate that keeps coffee warm without scorching it.

**Handmade in the Netherlands:** Each Moccamaster is handmade in the Netherlands with a 5-year warranty. This isn't mass-produced consumer electronics - it's precision manufacturing with attention to detail. The build quality shows in every component, from the copper boiling element to the durable housing.

**Key Features:**

* 95% positive Reddit sentiment (Rank: 100)
* Pump-free precision brewing
* Correct water temperature for extraction
* Brew-volume selector (half/full carafe)
* 40 oz / 1.25L capacity (10 cups)
* 4-6 minute brew time
* Single switch operation
* Auto shut-off after 100 minutes
* Quiet operation
* Handmade in Netherlands
* 5-year warranty
* Glass carafe with hotplate

**Best For:**

* Coffee enthusiasts wanting the best
* Anyone tired of mediocre coffee makers
* People who appreciate quality engineering
* Those wanting consistent results daily
* Households brewing 5-10 cups regularly
* Users valuing longevity over cheap replacements
* Anyone who takes coffee seriously
* People upgrading from pod machines

**Why 95% Positive & Rank 100?** This near-perfect approval and maximum ranking reflect the Moccamaster's legendary status in the coffee community. It's the coffee maker that coffee professionals recommend. The 95% positive sentiment shows overwhelming satisfaction from people who use it daily. Rank 100 (maximum possible) confirms this is the gold standard.

**Real-World Performance:** Users consistently report the Moccamaster makes noticeably better coffee than previous machines. The proper extraction temperature and flow rate bring out flavors that cheaper coffee makers miss. Many users report 10+ years of daily use with zero issues. The coffee stays warm on the hotplate without developing the burnt taste common with other machines.

**What Makes It Special:** The Moccamaster is SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) certified - one of the few home brewers to meet professional standards. The copper boiling element heats water to 196-205°F (optimal extraction range). The unique spray arm ensures even saturation of grounds. The brew basket design promotes proper bloom and extraction. Every detail is engineered for coffee quality.

**The Reddit Coffee Community's Choice:** The coffee subreddit consistently recommends the Moccamaster as the ""buy once, cry once"" solution for drip coffee. Users wish they'd bought it years earlier instead of wasting money on cheap machines. The 95% positive sentiment reflects people discovering that yes, a $348 coffee maker genuinely makes better coffee and lasts decades.

**What Users Love:**

* Coffee tastes noticeably better
* Consistent results every single day
* Lasts 10-20+ years with daily use
* Simple operation (one switch)
* Easy to clean and maintain
* Brews quickly (4-6 minutes)
* Beautiful, timeless design
* Backed by 5-year warranty

**Important Note:** The grind size, coffee amount, and tamping affect extraction quality. This is true for any brewing method. The Moccamaster provides the perfect environment for extraction, but you still need proper coffee preparation. Fresh beans, proper grind, and correct ratios matter.

**Value Proposition:** At $347.79, this is premium-priced for a coffee maker. But the 95% positive sentiment and Rank 100 show users consider it absolutely worth it. When you factor in 15-20 years of daily use, the cost per cup becomes negligible. You're investing in better coffee every single day for years or decades.

**Longevity & Sustainability:** Most cheap coffee makers last 2-3 years. The Moccamaster lasts 15-20+ years. That's 5-7 cheap machines avoided. The repairability and parts availability mean this is genuinely sustainable - fix it instead of replacing it. The handmade Netherlands construction ensures quality that endures.

**Minor Considerations:**

* Premium price (but maximum quality/longevity)
* Glass carafe not insulated (stays on hotplate)
* Requires counter space (not compact)
* Best results need quality beans and proper grind
* No built-in grinder or programming features

**Conclusion:** [The Moccamaster 53948 KBGV Select](https://www.recsmatter.com/products/B093DXS54M) represents the pinnacle of automatic drip coffee makers. Precision temperature control, proper extraction, brew-volume selector, and handmade Netherlands quality create coffee that simply tastes better. The 95% positive Reddit sentiment from 113 mentions and Rank 100 (maximum possible) reflect near-universal satisfaction. This is the coffee maker that coffee enthusiasts, professionals, and serious home brewers choose. If you want the best automatic drip coffee and a machine that lasts decades, this is it.

**Bottom Line:** Extremely highly recommended. The coffee maker Reddit's coffee community considers the absolute best for automatic drip brewing. Near-perfect approval and maximum ranking reflect legendary quality and performance. Premium price for premium coffee, every day, for decades.",1,1766735367.0,recsmatter,0,1.0,False

We hosted this year but all the cleaning & 90% off the cooking/shopping fell on me, he helped pay for dinner, along with his mom, my mom and our roommate.. They have a big house so it's a lot of dusting, vacuming, toilets, sinks, kitchen, tile floors, so sweeping & mopping, ect. so it's been a lot of work and I also do most of the shopping cause I work at a grocery store and I get a discount.

He asked me what I wanted a few weeks ago and I said I don't want any ""thing"", I want a trip or a nice sushi dinner. Well yesterday went well and then this morning I'm opening gifts with him, his mom and brother and he proceeds to tell me towards the end that my gift hasn't arrived yet and had me watch a video of a guy getting into this black infrared nylon sauna blanket, I was kinda in shock and said I don't really like it, I also said that's kinda gross, I don't wanna get all sweaty under a blanket and then you have to clean it, I look forward to going to the sauna, he proceeded to get very angry & I asked if he could return it cause it's was apparently $800 bundled with a red light therapy mask (didn't ask for that either), he said they have a shit return policy & then said he'll just keep it for himself. So it made me wonder, was that the plan all along? I took a break and called my mom cause the energy had gone bad and could feel his anger.  When I came back and asked him the brand and he could return it he called me an ungrateful bitch. He said I wasn't grateful for the espresso machine he brought for us either that was also very expensive, I drink cold brew coffee every morning cause it's easy on my stomach and I told him he bought that for himself too. He then said he is gonna get a gf who appreciates him. I decided to leave at this point cause we needed a break, I didn't want to fight on Christmas so I was leaving and as I walked out the door he said he doesn't love me anymore and wants to break up. I just said okay, fine and walked off cause maybe I deserve some respect?

I've had mixed feedback from my family and his mom, they said I should've pretended to like it and later ask to return it, my mom, older brother and dad thinks he was inconsiderate with the gift and shouldn't treat me that way. 

This man has a history of verbal abuse, literally screaming in my face calling me names, his other mom was like that and she committed suicide over 10 years ago (addiction/mental health) and we've been sober over 3 years both of us met in recovery.

To top it off I bought him On Clouds, spent $160 on shoes he needed cause his are beat up with a hole, a nice flannel, a bunch of treats and helped get his car hood painted, all things I knew he needed or would use. That's why I'm bummed cause he didn't even try to consider what I wanted or say, here's $800 for a trip, you plan it. 

He said he dipped into his savings for this gift and I would never ask him to do that, told him that too. 

I'm just sad, this has been the worst Christmas ever and I'm still sick and have to work again tomorrow.

waking up at 5 does make you *feel* disciplined for a while. but what about the people who don’t care about being “the 5 a.m. type” and just want time in the morning to move, read, or breathe?

honestly, i think 6 a.m. might be the sweet spot.

i’ve been running a tight-knit accountability community for a while now, helping people wake up early, work out, and do focused work *without* losing sleep.  
  
so i should probably be out here preaching the 5 a.m. gospel, right? but the truth is, most people just need enough sleep and a consistent plan.

here’s what i’ve noticed:

* when people sleep around 10:30–11 p.m. and wake around 6 a.m., they’re still getting 6–7 hours, which is realistic for most adults.  
* 5 a.m. sounds cool, but for many it just means chronic tiredness.  

if you start work around 9 or 10 a.m., waking at 6 still gives you about three solid hours to do stuff for *you*: workout, meditate, read, cook, journal, whatever matters. that’s more than enough time.

a few small things that help make 6 a.m. work:

1. get morning sunlight. natural light resets your body clock and helps your brain know it’s go-time.  
2. do your workout early. energy is highest in the morning and it sets the tone for the rest of the day.  
3. watch your caffeine**.** if you drink coffee after 1–2 p.m., you’ll mess up your sleep.  
4. wind down**.** dim lights after 9:30–10, fewer screens, less doom-scrolling, maybe read or talk to someone. simple stuff but it works.

She had an unusual first name, and was therefore totally easy to find online. I am taking the majority of commenters' advice: I won’t contact her through social media. If I see her again at the grocery store, then I'll chat with her and maybe leave her my number. If not, it'll be a tiny little reminder that I still have a little bit of my mojo.



But now a new story. There's someone at work, somewhat junior to me. We've worked together, but not for several years. We always had a distinctive sympatico, even when I was married and she had a live-in BF. We always kept our interactions professional though they were friendlier than typical work interactions. I admit that, when my wife announced that she wanted a divorce, I probably shared too much information with this colleague, but it was nice to get her perspective. That was about a year ago. At any rate this colleague is aware of my in-house separation.



I had not seen this colleague for the last eight or so months until the Xmas party last Friday (before Xmas). She was all big hugs and ""it's been ages"": the next day, she emailed, suggesting that we get together for coffee and ""catch up"" after the holidays. She sent her new phone number so that we can communicate by text rather than email. 



I'm 58 and she's around 32/33. I have no idea whether she sees me as a harmless and kindly old man, sort of like a mentor-uncle, with no sex appeal whatsoever; or if she sees me as an intriguing older romantic possibility. She did have a live-in partner a year ago, but some of her remarks hinted that that was over.



I will tread very carefully. I \*did\* reply positively to her invitation for coffee. But, damn ... if she's interested in hanging out beyond our coffee get-together, I'll be sorely tempted.",1,1766734992.0,Divorce,3,1.0,False
1pvyqkm,https://v.redd.it/e43f0wuy5i9g1,Renting 1BHK — but doing it Bangalore style,"A friend is renting out 1BHK and thought — why not make this a little more fun and human than endless DMs and broker calls.

🪧 FYI

\- This is for a friend 

\- Rent 20k (negotiable) + Deposit 

\- Flat is fully furnished and no restrictions 

\- Multi story, Gated society with electricity, water and security 

\- location- Saukya Road near Nurture International School 

So here’s the plan 👇

📍 What:

A 2–3 hour casual meet-up at the house

🕙 When:

26th December 2025, 10:00 AM – 12:00 noon (can spill over a bit if conversations are good)

☕ What you get:

	•	Black coffee

	•	Biscoff biscuits

	•	Zero small talk pressure

	•	Optional startup / career / growth advice if you want it

🎯 The goal:

By the end of these 2–3 hours, we finalize the rent for the 1BHK.

Simple. Transparent. 

No back-and-forth for weeks.

✅ Qualification (please read before DMing)

You should ideally be:

	•	Someone actually looking to rent immediately (not “exploring options”)

	•	Comfortable with a direct, no-broker setup

	•	Respectful of the space (and people’s time)

	•	Working professional / founder / freelancer / couple — basically low drama, high clarity

	•	Okay with a slightly unconventional process 🙂

If this resonates, DM me with:

	1.	Who you are

	2.	When you’re looking to move

	3.    What’s your budget 

If enough folks are interested, 

I’ll confirm the exact date + location.

Worst case: good coffee and interesting conversations.

Best case: house rented, stories exchanged, and everyone wins.

1pvyp9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdEmailMasters/comments/1pvyp9v/has_anyone_tried_a_hasslefree_bulk_email_tool/,Has anyone tried a hassle-free bulk email tool? Looking for honest recommendations!,"Recently, I've been busy with client development and needed to send emails to hundreds of potential clients. Traditional bulk email tools have been a nightmare. Either the sending gets throttled halfway, or the domain gets blacklisted by email providers, and costs just keep piling up. Then I happened to discover TNTwuyou's bulk email tool, and using it feels like finding a treasure—had to share my experience!

 

Why is it reliable?  

 

Smart speed control: Unlike some tools that just 'bombard' recipients, TNTwuyou automatically adjusts the sending speed based on feedback from email providers. For example, if you import 1,000 emails at once, it won’t send them all at once but distributes them in batches at a steady pace, avoiding throttling.  

High delivery quality: With other tools, emails often ended up in spam. After switching to TNTwuyou, inbox rates improved significantly, especially for new domains. No more getting blacklisted immediately.  

Stable performance across regions: Need to send emails to overseas clients? Latency is much lower compared to the tools I used before, and clients receive emails faster. No more worrying about emails getting 'lost'.  

Cost-friendly: Charges are based on actual usage, perfect for small teams or testing stages. No need to pay for unused features—enough savings for several cups of coffee!

 

Additionally, it has a fast interface response, maintains a steady sending pace, and avoids the awkward situation of 'stopping halfway'.  

It supports direct integration with CRM and can trigger sending via Webhook or backend queues, eliminating manual work—ideal for scenarios where you need to 'send while controlling the volume'.  

The email filtering feature (like cleaning invalid addresses) is very useful, automatically filtering out 'dead emails' before sending, improving delivery efficiency.",1,1766734784.0,ColdEmailMasters,0,1.0,False

second we've already had some AI revamps those are nice.  
but like how mission sharing works needs a look at, better mission management UI/UX is desperate after years of this it still feels like its missing some major QoL and utility features.

space legs is fun but trying to manage some of the draw backs and failure states makes it rough. its not that those need to go, its that sending you star systems away sometimes is a bit antithetical to trying to run multiple legs missions on a planet. how certain things flow and work it could use a couple passes, like security scanning at a glance seams right but its real awkward, and sort of weirdly timed sometimes. but mostly its just missing gameplay flow you'd get in other games. but thats leaving it vague to rant a bit.

the things I would love is:  
\- a pass in stealth and personnel security systems  
\- better and more competent hacking systems  
\- a slight relook at infiltration  
\- bunch of other nice to have things that would take to long to list hear with out like better conversation, and sort of just up to them. like I would love personal pad interactions instead of just data ports. just needs better fleshing out.

honestly if they are willing to focus some effort on small things like that, maybe we could actually get ship interiors (Though i do hope they realize that it doesn't have to do anything, just give a coffee machine you can drink coffee from. just random animations like that. its a lot of small things work, but its not like we need sub sub systems to fiddle with, but if they want to do that, having ways to customize and advance interfaces would be something to look at.) A vr pass to work with newer vr controllers (and have leg vr finally) would be nice. but anyway im just rambling a rough draft at best.

Before the noise begins, there’s that calm space where you get to choose how you’ll show up. Getting better isn’t about chasing perfection, it’s about small choices that slowly shift everything.

Maybe you pause before reacting. Maybe you reach for water before coffee. Maybe, just once, you speak to yourself with the kindness you give everyone else. It feels strange at first, like learning a new dialect of compassion. But it lingers.

Real growth isn’t glamorous. Some days you stumble. Some days you start over. That’s part of the rhythm.

Looking back at my 2025 season, it was a year of profound growth, but also one of exhaustion and hard-learned lessons.

Here is how my year unfolded.

Phase 1: The January Spark (The Honeymoon Phase)

In January, I was full of ""New Year, New Me"" energy. I bought every recommended textbook and joined a premier coaching institute. I used to study for four hours every morning, feeling invincible. I told myself that with 11 months to go, 99.5 percentile was a certainty. My physical health was great; I was hitting the gym and eating well. Mentally, I was at my peak.

Phase 2: The Summer Slump (April – June)

By April, the novelty had worn off. Arithmetic was getting tougher, and Reading Comprehension felt like a chore. I started making my first big mistake: I focused only on my strengths. I loved Arithmetic, so I did it all day, completely ignoring my weak Geometry and Verbal skills.

The Toll:
Mentally: I started feeling the first hits of ""imposter syndrome"" when others in my batch scored higher on class tests.

Physically: I stopped going to the gym to ""save time"" for study, which only made me feel more sluggish.

Phase 3: The Mock Marathon (July – September)

July was when the real pressure started—Mock Season. This is where I hit a wall. I used to take one mocks a week, but I made the second big mistake: I didn't analyze them. I was obsessed with the score, not the strategy. When my scores plateaued at the 80th percentile, I began to panic.

I started staying up until 3:00 AM, fueled by black coffee and anxiety. My sleep cycle was ruined. I was physically exhausted, my eyes were constantly strained, and I became irritable with my family.

Phase 4: The Burnout (October)

October was the hardest month. I was mentally fried. Every time I opened a mock, my heart would race. I was overthinking every question. My third mistake was isolation. I stopped talking to friends, thinking any minute not spent studying was a waste. In reality, I was just staring at the screen without absorbing anything. I was emotionally drained, feeling like my entire self-worth was tied to a three-digit number.

Phase 5: The November Final Push

By November, I was running on fumes. I tried to ""cram"" logic puzzles, which is impossible. On the day of the exam, I was so physically tired and mentally anxious that I made silly calculation errors in the DILR section—the kind I never made at home.

The Result: 88 Percentile

When the results eventually came, seeing 88 %ile felt like a punch in the gut. It wasn't ""bad,"" but it wasn't what I had sacrificed my year for.

My Reflections (The ""Why"")

The 88th percentile wasn't a failure of my intelligence; it was a reflection of how I managed—or mismanaged—my resources.

Looking back at the year, my biggest mistake was a lack of strategic honesty. I spent months ""studying"" what I was already good at because it gave me a false sense of security, while I let my weakest sections rot until it was too late. I treated the mocks like a gambling game where I hoped for a high score, rather than a diagnostic tool to fix my flaws.

By the time November arrived, I had sacrificed my physical health and my social life, thinking that ""suffering"" equaled ""working hard."" In reality, I was just burning myself out. My brain was too tired to think critically during the pressure of the actual exam, and those silly mistakes in the DILR section were the direct result of a mind that hadn't rested in months. I learned the hard way that you cannot win a mental race with an exhausted mind.

Gratitude isn’t just a nice idea, it’s a quiet revolution. It’s easy to say, “be thankful for what you have,” but living it means slowing down enough to actually notice. For a long time, I chased what was next, a better job, more certainty, a clearer path forward. But while waiting for life to feel complete, I almost missed the good already happening around me. The first sip of coffee in the morning. The comfort of a friend’s message. The simple miracle of a body that keeps carrying me through.

Being grateful doesn’t mean ignoring what’s hard, it means recognizing the steady, ordinary gifts that hold you up when everything else feels uncertain. And something shifts when you do. You stop measuring your life by what’s missing and start seeing how full it already is. Gratitude doesn’t change the world, it changes the way you move through it.",1,1766733127.0,Word_of_The_Day_Affir,0,1.0,False

It's been almost a month since my last huge outbreak. I can't say I spent this month completely pulling free, BUT  most of the days i didn't pull at all and some days i successfully managed to stop myself after a hair or two. 

What helped? WRITING 

A lot of us are very anxious people, people who analyse and think a lot, who have a lot of unexpressed emotions and feelings.

My advice - WRITE IT DOWN 

That is what helped me. I carry this tiny notebook with me everywhere and every time i feel the urge, or a strong feeling or any thoughts or an empty head I grab a pen and i write it all down. Not taking notes on the phone, but write it all down with a pen on paper. 

❗The idea is to REPLACE THE URGE with a thinking and motor process such as writing. You put your urge into words instead of acting on it. At first it doesn't help much, of course, but with time you REWIRE your brain by forming a NEW HABITUAL PATTERN, new path between neurons, and with constant practice you train your brain to respond differently on the urge to pull. 

YOU should try it to and maybe you'll find it helpful.  
The urge > pen + paper => write everything down (your mood, thoughts, ideas, plans for the evening, movie review, a poem, groceries list, describe your friends, how your morning coffee tatses, etc. ANYTHING your write it down) 

I wish you luck and strength. And i really believe some people will find it helpful to reduce their urges and pulling episodes ❤️‍🩹

1pvy93k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pvy93k/mf_the_regret/,[MF] The Regret,"It was our fourth day of the confession. I was parking my car beside Mr. Smith’s Volkswagen, when I saw his face-the seventh man of the group. He was tall, lean, broad-shouldered and possibly in his late thirties. His hair was properly cropped and he had a tattoo on his right arm. A peculiar sadness on his face caught my attention and made me curious, wondering,” What could be his story?”

We all settled comfortably in our chairs, arranged in a full circle. He sat beside me. I waved to him, but he parted his lips and muttered,” Hey there!” As was customary, Mrs. Alison, establishing herself right at the center of the circle, dressed in skirt and a white formal top announced, “Good Evening all! Today we have Mr. Fox with us. I would like you all to welcome him and heed to his story.” She handed the mic to him and positioned herself somewhere behind the chair.

Mr. Fox, reluctant initially, looked around and slowly getting up from his chair introduced himself. “Hello everyone! My name is William Fox. I live nearby. I am thirty-seven. And my story is…” He at once paused, looking down. I started to think why is he looking down? Is he about to tell me something tragic and is hesitant? Or is he just shy? But after a while he cleared his throat, looked around again and continued.

“So..Umm..I got married when I was around 24. I was earning well as a consultant in a mid-sized startup. And was lucky enough to get married to the love of my life. I met her in college,” his cheeks reddened a bit. “I still remember the day when I first saw her. Those black eyes and brown hair floating in the air. That innocence on her face and that delicate smile made me skip a beat. Within a few days, we started seeing each other typically in the college canteen. We ordered a plate of dim sums and two cups of coffee. That was our usual meal. After three years of dating in college, we got placed together in a small start-up.”

 

“’To love someone is the most difficult task in the world’, I read this quote somewhere, but realized it only when I was in the startup, when life challenges confronted me. The fights grew a lot more. Things became difficult. She became overwhelming. I didn’t know how to handle her. The work pressure added more to the frustration.” He sat back on the chair and cleared his throat. “I used to work 14 hours a day that time and she was also working the same. Although, in love, as it is said that if you have a common goal, you are likely to succeed, but I believe love is far more complex than just having common *goals*,” he air-quoted,” I can probably say that that period marked the beginning of the decline. During those days, I grew more irritated. Even little things started annoying me-shoes not in the rack, wet towels on the sofa, dirty bathroom-I didn’t seem to care that it also could be my fault. And I blamed her only. She also did the same, but for her stuffs were different-not supporting her in the kitchen, messy sofa, unpaid electricity/wi-fi bills etc. etc.

“Two years passed like that and we didn’t seem to reach a middle ground. In relationships, the middle ground is everything gentlemen! Its everything!” By now, this man had my utmost attention. I was listening him with precision, wondering what might happen next. “So, as I said middle-ground,” he uttered in a strict tone, gesticulating,” is important and to achieve it, communication is the key, which was a concept alien to us or maybe we chose to ignore it. I vividly remember one day, when we fought, it was like one of the worst. It was the night of August. I was working on my laptop, as she dashed into my room. “How can you forget again?” she shouted raising the wi-fi bill in the air. I ignored her. After a while she slammed the paper onto the table and this time spoke in a calm, authoritative tone, ‘Dear Sir! Stop being so freaking irresponsible!’ I couldn’t take it, her tone affected me the most. I closed the lid in anger got up from the table and started yelling at her, “Listen! Enough with this non-sense. If I couldn’t do it, why can’t you pay the bill. After all, you too earn right or you don’t?” She gazed at me furiously, clenching her teeth.

“The, she dashed out of the room and a little later I heard the sound of something being crashed onto the floor. I immediately went out. She was there, with the broken wi-fi in her hand. ‘Now no use of any bill, I did it right eh?’ The audacity with which she said it, enraged me. However, I did nothing and taking a long deep breath just went inside my room.”

Fox paused for a while and sighed.” Marriage really tests your patience sometimes. It really does.” I, sitting there, thought, remembering my wife, well yes sometimes it does, it really does! “Later, some peace prevailed. Maybe, because we started communicating more and more. We left the startup and joined another firm. However, this time we were in separate companies and fortunately workload was quite less. This lessened the tension. We were able to go out more often; our intimacy improved in every respect and the future looked stable. But now something else, not in the marriage, but in me, that was hidden for a long time began to gradually arise. Certain vices folks, certain vices, can never leave you, such was the case of mine. Since a teenager, I had a massive interest in pornography. Before meeting my wife, I had several affairs most of them-lust-oriented. To be honest,” he cleared his throat, “Honestly, before meeting my wife, I didn’t even know that I was even able to love someone, but when she came into my life things changed. I felt the blessings of love for the first time. But lust still never left me. I still remember, during the start-up days, when we used to fight a lot, out of anger and annoyance sometimes I used to check out certain dating apps. Once, I even created a profile and did a few swipes, but then a little pesky voice inside me made me halt.”

Somebody in the audience wearing a denim t-shirt and jeans raised his hand. He looked towards him. “Did you feel guilty when that voice started irritating you?”. Mr. Fox coughed, thought for a while and keeping his hands on his knees replied calmly,” Well, I felt, since I didn’t do anything that wrong, I shouldn’t feel guilty, but that voice was very overpowering. It made me feel something I never felt. Anyways, so everything was going on smoothly when one day at the office party I saw a very beautiful woman standing at the bar counter, talking to her friends. She might be the new HR or something I didn’t know. My heart pounded and I almost skipped a beat. Her big, brown eyes and that curvy figure mesmerized me. I could feel blood rushing to my cheeks. Holding the glass of wine in my hand, I started checking her out slowly, intently like a predator scanning his prey.

“The voice rose again but ignoring it, I thought of experimenting. I decided to pursue her; at the same time, I lied to myself saying oh! a five-minute talk won’t do anything wrong. During our conversation, I got to know that she was a new recruit in our AI team and is a fresher. Her name was I guess…. Anna. She joined a few days back. We talked to each other for a while sitting on the sofa holding our glasses, maybe for an hour. Later, we exchanged numbers. That day I went home an hour late, as I also dropped her home.

“I am not lying gentlemen!” he looked towards me briefly, “that night I couldn’t sleep well. I was torn between two thoughts: Is it a romantic pursuit or maybe I am just trying to friends and overthinking it? However, deep within, I knew that I have begun to do something wrong. But, as they say Ignorance is bliss so, the very next day when I reached office, I opened MS Teams and pinged ‘Hello’ to her. I waited for her response; it was like the sweet anticipation you feel in the beginning of any affair. She replied after five minutes: Hey Adam! How you doing? I felt a thrill instantly in my heart, something I never felt in years. We texted for a while. I left my seat and went to her cubicle. That day I did nothing, but only spent time with her. We had our lunch together. In the evening while we were conversating, she at once asked, ‘Hey! What are your weekend plans?’ I paused for a while, looked at her and stammered, ‘I—I am not sure.” She narrowed her eyes and with a smile on her red lips said—Oh! okay! I felt an awkward sensation instantly, that voice started whispering in my ears, ’What the hell you doing?” But I ignored it and *deliberately* replied to her question. ‘Let’s meet at 4 pm at the boulevard café this Saturday, your time.’

“Things quickly escalated, we eventually started dating full-fledged. But, look at my ignorance, I still didn’t call it a date, in my mind I called it just another *quality time spending with my colleague*. My wife was completely unaware of this, partly because she trusted me and partly because I was cunning. I had two phones, one regular, the other one that I used to talk to Anna I always kept in my laptop bag, so my wife couldn’t find it out. The weekends, when I was supposed to go out with her, I made excuses that I am going out with my friend. The others were converted into business trips, where actually I was with Anna in some other country caressing her pink lips, squeezing her body, making love.

“I lied through and through, even to myself. My lust disguised itself as love, conquered my soul absolutely. All this continued before the *final decision* was made and it extended till two years. During these years, it also came to me as a surprise that I only argued with my wife when she suspected me otherwise, I like a calculated thief managed everything. I noticed that I was frustrated less often, maybe because the novelty of my affair neutralized all life’s boredom including my marriage.

He sighed and raised his hand as if to explain something, “Gentlemen! Novelty is like an addiction, like a real one. When it hits you, you are like the most pleasant human being on earth. I even remember, whenever I had those occasional fights with my wife, I sometimes used to go straight out of my house and return after like an hour or two.

He paused abruptly then continued nodding his head,” yes, yes, you all rightly guessed it. For those two hours, I was with Anna in an intimate moment and when I returned back, I embraced my wife and whispered words of flattery in her ear holding her soft waist and that resolved everything between us. Lust and lies became a solution for everything. Ahh! such a conniving man I was,” he exclaimed. “Anyways, finally I decided that I will leave my wife and will settle with Anna. I made a deliberate plan directly aimed at disturbing her to an extent that she will leave me automatically. I started arguing on trivial things be it the wet towel, messy bedsheet, water on the shower floor and I made sure my voice was high enough to irritate her. All this I started doing six months before the decision. The consequences of my actions bore fruit in the way that initially my wife got frustrated, then she got scared and finally she became numb. Like complete numb. I had ripped her of all emotions at the end. She felt like a cold, dead body to me. But I still didn’t stop.”

As he was going on, an old man wearing a yellow jacket and listening to him keenly, raised his hand and asked narrowing his eyes, “Excuse me Sir! I have a question?” Mr. Fox stopped and looked towards him. “Yes?” “May I know are you a sadist?” The bluntness of the question took him by surprise making him pensive, as if the old man had stirred those memories back to life. He paused and answered with a smile, “No Sir! I am not a sadist. An infidel man is only consumed by lust and lies which guides him. I never sought any pleasure in making her suffer, never even dreamt. I only wanted to get rid of her anyhow, which I eventually did.”

I was mesmerized by the level of analysis this man made. I nodded my head and whispered under my breath, as if agreeing with him-An infidel man is only consumed by lust and lies which guides him. Very true, very true!

He sat upright on his chair, coughed a little,” So, everything worked as planned. I left her and moved in with Anna to a new city. Although, I thought that now I will live the life of my dreams, as my lies had promised to me in the beginning, it didn’t happen. I was overwhelmed by shame and guilt. My new wife Anna, she got worried about my condition. Initially, I couldn’t make out what is happening to me but later I understood. That pesky little voice has taken full control and was shouting in my head, ‘What have you done?’

“My marriage took a drastic turn. My arguments became more violent. I drank heavily. Even there were times, when I used to hit Anna and later when I stopped, I couldn’t watch her cry and dashed out of the room in total despair. A year went by like this folks, and finally Anna gave up on me,” his voice started choking a little, “after admitting me to a rehabilitation center, which I still visit these days, she left me for good. Later, I heard she moved in with another colleague. That totally broke me. I guess that was my retribution gentlemen! Karma hit me back.” “These days, I live alone, trying to work on myself in my little apartment and the only dream or maybe a nightmare I saw every day is of hers, my first love. Her sad face looking towards me, as if beseeching me, to give her the love back that she deserved….”

The bell rang. It was already dark, around 7 in the evening. We all clapped for Mr. Fox, although I could see some faces already frustrated, maybe they didn’t like him. We dispersed and were asked to come back the day after tomorrow.

As I was going towards my car, I saw him sitting alone on a bench with a cigarette trapped between his fingers and his face wet he was talking to himself. He is probably crying, I thought, but something in me held me back so I didn’t move any further. Maybe, it was that *pesky* little voice-which we all ignore- asking me to do the *right thing.* To leave a man, as it is, as he suffered in the quiet moments of his redemption…..",1,1766733033.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

She instantly got a bit impressed by a few hobbies/ passions i have outside my profession… also thought i kinda resembled an actor for some reason. 

She was vocal coz she was a senior so you get the dynamics. 

Later on our common friend said she was behaving kinda into me. I brushed it off. Mainly coz of our positions.  Basically got no chance is what i thought. I later got to know we’re the same age. 

She’s really cute. Met again on a night shift, had some coffee alone. Talked about random stuff. Maybe our vibes didn’t match perfectly that night but she’s still stuck in my head for some reason. 

Confused on how to take this further. 

For context, she can’t ruin my work flow/ other stuff. We’re from way different departments. It’s more just outta curtesy.

***The Day of the Ascent remains the single most documented event in human history, yet few recall that the only live feeds available in the first hour came from a handful of weather satellites and a bored CNN crew who thought they were covering a glorified laser pointer test.***

***Valerius Thorne, First Imperial Archivist***

**LOCATION:** Kestrel Foundation ""Equatorial Platform Alpha"" (International Waters, Indian Ocean) **DATE:** April 12, 204X **SOURCE:** Raw Rush / CNN Field Unit 44 **PERSONNEL:** Brenda Miller (Corr.), Mike ""Shaky"" Henderson (Cam.)

""Check the white balance, Mike. The glare off this solar glass is killing my contouring.""

Brenda Miller kicked a piece of loose gravel off the edge of the landing pad. It fell for a long time before hitting the ocean swell churningtwenty meters below. She adjusted her blazer, sweating profusely in the humid equatorial air. Behind her, the facility hummed—a sleek, terrifyingly clean expanse of white polymer and solar skin that looked less like a launch site and more like an oversized iPhone floating in the sea.

""White balance is good, Brenda. We’re live in five,"" Mike grunted from behind the lens. He was a veteran of three war zones, and he looked like he’d prefer a mortar attack to this humidity.

""Five minutes? God, kill me now,"" Brenda muttered, pulling a compact mirror from her pocket. ""Look at this lineup, Mike. Look at them."" She gestured vaguely with her chin toward the small cluster of other journalists huddled under a shade canopy. ""That’s Jean-Luc from *Le Monde Science*. He writes about particle accelerators. That guy in the tweed? *Nature* magazine. He’s literally asleep. And the Japanese crew is filming b-roll of the waves. We are the only major network here, and we are only here because the producer thinks anything with the word 'Kestrel' on it might bleed viewers.""

""Reid is big news, Bren. The *Connecticut*...""

""Reid is dead, Mike!"" she snapped, keeping her voice just under the register that would alert the Kestrel press liaison, a terrifyingly polite woman named Sarah who hadn't blinked in two hours. ""He’s been dead for three months. His widow is wearing white. This isn't a resurrection; it's a legacy project. 'Quantum Optical Data Transmission.' Do you know what that means? It means they’re shining a flashlight at a satellite to see if it blinks back faster. It’s science fair crap. We should be in DC covering the Appropriations bill.""

""Two minutes.""

Brenda sighed, shaking out her hair. She adopted the 'Serious Journalist' pose—left foot forward, mic held at sternum height, brow furrowed with intellectual concern.

""Okay. Let’s get this over with. Give me a count.""

""In three, two...""

Brenda’s face transformed instantly. The cynicism evaporated, replaced by a mask of urgent professional curiosity.

""This is Brenda Miller, reporting live from the middle of the Indian Ocean, standing on the deck of the Kestrel Foundation’s mysterious 'Platform Alpha.' It has been exactly ninety-one days since the tragic loss of visionary billionaire Georges Reid, the man who gave his life to save the crew of the *USS Connecticut*. But today, his legacy lives on. Behind me, scientists are preparing for a groundbreaking experiment in quantum communications...""

She paused for effect, turning slightly to gesture at the empty platform behind her. There was nothing there but a large, circular seal in the center of the deck, painted with hazard stripes.

""...Critics have called the Kestrel Foundation a 'headless chicken' since Reid's disappearance. Stock prices have wobbled. But today, the Foundation promises a demonstration that will prove they are still on the cutting edge. They claim they will establish a 'continuous matter-stream' connection with a geostationary satellite. Now, I’m not a physicist, but I’m told this could revolutionize how we download our movies.""

She cut the smile. ""Back to you, Anderson.""

""Cut,"" Mike said. ""That was... proficient.""

""It was garbage,"" Brenda groaned, slumping against the railing. ""Did you see the press kit? No interviews. No Q&A. Just 'observe the test.' They didn't even give us coffee. Just these pouches of... what is this? 'Nutrient hydrator'?"" She squeezed a silver pouch from the welcome basket. ""It tastes like despair, Mike.""

She looked over at the *Nature* journalist, who had woken up and was now staring at his tablet with a frown.

""Hey, Einstein,"" she called out. ""What’s the over-under on this thing actually working?""

The man looked up, pushing his glasses up his nose. ""It’s not a communication laser,"" he said softly.

""Excuse me?""

""I’ve been looking at the power draw schematics they released,"" he tapped his screen. ""To send a quantum key distribution signal, you need milliwatts. Maybe watts if the atmosphere is thick."" He pointed at the massive conduit cables running along the floor of the platform, thick as a man’s thigh, pulsing with a low-frequency thrum that vibrated in the soles of their shoes. ""That cable is rated for gigawatts. You don’t use gigawatts to send an email, Ms. Miller. You use gigawatts to melt a hole in the sky.""

Brenda looked at the cable. She felt the vibration. It was getting stronger. The ocean below them seemed to be trembling.

""Mike,"" she said, her voice losing its edge. ""Are you rolling?""

""I stopped to save battery.""

""Roll. Now.""

""Why? Nothing’s happening.""

""Because the water is boiling, Mike.""

It was true. Around the legs of the platform, the ocean was frothing. Not from heat, but from sound. A deep, resonant frequency was building up, a bass note so low it bypassed the ears and rattled the ribcage. The birds that had been circling the platform suddenly scattered, screaming, fleeing toward the horizon.

The polite press liaison, Sarah, stepped forward. She wasn't holding a microphone. She was holding a pair of heavy industrial ear defenders.

""Ladies and gentlemen of the press,"" she said, her voice amplified by the facility's speakers. ""Please put on your protective gear. And please look up. The Ascendant is arriving.""

""Arriving?"" Brenda jammed the ear defenders over her head. ""I thought we were sending a signal *up*?""

""Look up!"" Mike yelled, tilting the camera almost ninety degrees.

The sky above the Indian Ocean was a perfect, hard blue. There wasn't a cloud in sight. But then, the blue *split*.

It started as a pinprick of light, high in the zenith—so bright it was visible even against the noon sun. It wasn't a star. It was a falling star. It grew larger, descending with terrifying velocity.

""Is that a missile?"" Brenda screamed, though she couldn't hear herself.

""It’s too slow!"" Mike shouted back.

The object plummeted. It wasn't falling; it was being *driven*. A streak of white fire tore through the atmosphere, trailing a sonic boom that hit the platform like a physical hammer blow. The journalists were knocked to their knees. The *Nature* writer lost his glasses.

But the object didn't crash.

At five thousand feet, the fire vanished. The object—a sleek, teardrop-shaped pod of black metal, identical to the hull material of the *Cousteau*—decelerated instantly. It defied inertia. One moment it was a meteor; the next, it was a hovering monolith, silent and motionless, suspended directly above the hazard circle on the deck.

And then, from the bottom of the pod, something dropped.

It wasn't a bomb. It was a cable. A thin, shimmering ribbon of carbon nanotube composite, or unknown equivalent, unspooling towards the deck. It touched the center of the hazard circle with the delicacy of a spider lowering itself on a thread.

*Clang.*

Magnetic locks engaged. The platform groaned.

Brenda scrambled to her feet, grabbing the mic. The signal light on the camera was red. They were live. The producer in Atlanta was probably screaming in her earpiece, but she couldn't hear him.

""Anderson... Anderson, are you seeing this?"" she gasped, breathlessly. ""We... we don't know what we're looking at. Something just fell from space. It’s... it’s tethered to the platform. It looks like... my god, Mike, zoom in on the cable. It goes *up*. It goes all the way up.""

The camera tilted back. The ribbon of black material stretched into the sky, thinning into a razor line that disappeared into the heavens. It didn't end. It connected the ocean to the void.

But the silence was shattered by the beat of rotors.

A white helicopter, emblazoned with the golden Kestrel, coming from a nearby scientific vessel, banking hard to land on the secondary pad. The door slid back before the skids touched down.

A man stepped out.

Brenda gasped. The *Nature* writer dropped his tablet. The world held its breath.

It was Georges Reid.

The dead billionaire walked across the deck, his suit immaculate, his stride purposeful. He didn't look like a survivor; he looked like a conqueror. He walked right past the stunned scientists, straight up to Mike’s camera lens, filling the frame with a face the world had mourned for ninety days.

He smiled—a dazzling, charming, impossible smile.

""Ladies and gentlemen of Earth,"" he announced, spreading his hands. ""The Kestrel Foundation gives you the Arthur C. Clarke space elevator.""

He pointed to the black thread piercing the sky.

""We can now drink at the fountain of Paradise!""

He turned his gaze to Brenda and the rest of the motley group of second-rate journalists. With a theatrical wave of his hand, the opaque surface of the pod's lower hull shimmered and dissolved into transparency. What had appeared to be a solid container was revealed to be a panoramic lounge—a curved wall of glass displaying plush leather armchairs and a wet bar.

""Care to join me for a little trip?"" he asked, his voice smooth and inviting. ""It is a free ride. Two hours to thirty-six thousand kilometers."" He winked at the camera. ""The view is quite something I was told.""

**NEW YORK** — The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange witnessed historic volatility this morning as the ""Reid Shock"" reverberated through global equity markets. What began as a scientific demonstration in the Indian Ocean has evolved into a full-scale liquidity crisis for the traditional aerospace and energy sectors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,200 points in early trading, dragged down by a catastrophic sell-off in defense and aerospace heavyweights.

**The End of the Rocket Era?** The catalyst for the rout is the Kestrel Foundation's claim—now visually corroborated by global media—of a functional space elevator. Analysts at Goldman Sachs issued a rare ""Strong Sell"" rating on the entire traditional launch sector within minutes of the announcement.

""If the cost-per-kilogram to orbit truly drops from the current industry standard of $1,500 to a still unknown number, the business model for chemical rocketry evaporates overnight,"" said Sarah Jenkins, Chief Strategy Officer at Morgan Stanley. ""We are not looking at a market correction; we are looking at an extinction event for combustion-based propulsion. Inventory in booster stages is now effectively scrap metal.""

Shares in major launch providers (Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin) triggered circuit breakers three times before noon, shedding nearly 35% of their capitalization. The planned IPO for several ""New Space"" startups has been indefinitely postponed.

**The 'Gravity Dividend'** Conversely, the ""Zero-G"" sector—a basket of theoretical stocks involving orbital manufacturing, asteroid mining, and solar power satellites—has exploded.

Sovereign Pacific Banking Group (SPBG), the financial entity controlled by the Reid family, saw its ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) surge 400% in pre-market trading before the SEC and SGX suspended activity pending ""material disclosure clarifications.""

""The market is trying to price in a monopoly on the vertical axis,"" notes Takahashi Sato of Nomura Securities. ""If Kestrel controls the only tether, they effectively function as a toll booth for the solar system. The valuation is theoretically infinite.""

**The New Frontier of Hospitality** While industrial sectors panicked, the hospitality and tourism industry saw unprecedented vertical gains. Major hotel groups, previously grounded by terrestrial limitations, wasted no time capitalizing on Reid's invitation to ""Paradise.""

* **Accor & Hilton:** Both giants announced preliminary ""Orbital Expansion"" strategies within hours of the broadcast. Shares spiked 25% and 18% respectively on the news.
* **Booking Holdings:** The travel conglomerate momentarily crashed its own servers by updating its search interface to include ""Low Earth Orbit"" as a valid destination region, a move that algorithmically drove its stock to an all-time high.

""The elevator changes the math of space tourism from a billionaire's hobby to a middle-class vacation,"" said Henri Giscard, CEO of Accor, in a hastily convened press release. ""We are already drafting plans for the first 'Novotel Terminus' at the geostationary limit. The view will be standard.""

**Commodities and Energy** The shockwave extended to commodities.

* **Oil & Gas:** Futures dipped 4% on speculation that orbital solar arrays could now be deployed cost-effectively, threatening long-term fossil fuel demand.
* **Rare Earths:** Prices for Platinum group metals plummeted on the assumption that asteroid mining is now commercially viable, potentially flooding the market with supply within the decade.
* **Steel/Carbon Composites:** Spiked 15% as infrastructure speculation begins for ""Terminus City"" logistics hubs.

**The Central Bank Response** The Federal Reserve and the ECB have announced emergency liquidity injections to stabilize the repo markets, fearing that the sudden devaluation of aerospace collateral could trigger a broader credit crunch.

""It is a moment of creative destruction,"" wrote the editorial board of the *Financial Times* this morning. ""Georges Reid has not just built a ladder to the stars; he has kicked the ladder away from the entire 20th-century industrial base.""

Trading is expected to remain volatile as the G7 finance ministers convene for an emergency summit tonight in Geneva.

Here's what I learned.,"At the start of 2025, I'd never won a hackathon. By June, I'd won two. Not participated. Won.

Here's the breakdown of what changed.

**Hackathon #1: Sui Hackathon 2025 (1st Prize - AI Track)**

The challenge: Build something with AI + blockchain in 48 hours.

My team built **TrustChain** \- a skill verification platform that analyzes your GitHub and resume, then stores verifiable skill reports on decentralized storage.

Stack: Django backend + React frontend + OpenAI for analysis + Sui blockchain + Walrus storage

What won it for us: We didn't try to be clever. We built something that actually worked end-to-end. Judges could upload a resume, see the AI analysis, and verify the report on-chain. No ""imagine if"" slides.

**Hackathon #2: Code for Change 2025 (2nd Runner Up - Nepal's biggest hackathon)**

The challenge: Build something for social impact.

We built **AutiSahara** \- an early autism screening platform for children aged 16-30 months. Parents answer the M-CHAT-R/F questionnaire, upload videos for behavioral analysis, and doctors review everything in a dedicated dashboard.

Stack: Django REST + React + PostgreSQL

What won it for us: We talked to actual doctors before writing code. The screening questionnaire we implemented is the actual clinical standard. We weren't building a toy.

**What I learned:**

1. **Ship the boring version first.** Fancy animations don't matter if login is broken.
2. **Django REST Framework is stupidly fast for prototyping.** I can have auth, permissions, and a full CRUD API in an hour. Then React consumes it.
3. **Talk to users before the hackathon.** Both winning projects started with conversations, not code.
4. **Sleep is optional, coffee is not.** (kidding... mostly)

**My stack if anyone's curious:**

* Backend: Python, Django, DRF, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis
* Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind
* DevOps: Docker, Nginx, DigitalOcean

I'm from Nepal, working remotely. Currently building a few side projects:

* **Savvitic** \- Reddit saved posts manager with full-text search
* **Pdflet** \- HTML to PDF API for developers

I work with many founders who mistakenly assume ""branding"" simply means having an eye-catching logo and color palette.

No doubt this approach worked in 2015, but as 2026 approaches, everything has dramatically shifted.

Customer trust has reached record low levels. People no longer buy ""products""; they buy ecosystems and values. If you are building a brand right now, stop focusing on vanity metrics and embrace these 7 strategies instead.

**1. Purpose-Driven (But actually mean it)**

Consumers now possess more advanced BS detectors.

* **Old School Approach:** Attaching a green leaf symbol on packaging could suffice.
* **2026 Way:** Your business model serves a specific function. Consider Patagonia; any claims about caring must be reflected in both operations and marketing materials alike.

  
**2. Hyper-Segmentation (The End of ""One Size Fits All"")**

Stop trying to please everyone.

* **Stat:** Studies reveal that personalized experiences make people 8 out of 10 times more likely to buy something.
* **Strategy:** Leverage data to create micro-campaigns tailored for different target audiences based on location or demographic information. For instance, Gen Z users in NYC should receive messages tailored towards them, while Millennials living in Texas should experience unique messaging approaches.

**3. Community > Audience**

An audience consumes; a community engages.

* **The Shift:** To truly build customer engagement and reduce marketing fatigue for customers, create spaces (Discord, Circles, Reddit forums or IRL-run clubs) where your customers can interact directly. This way you will get feedback from many sides instead of just yours alone.
* **Example:** Sephora’s ""Beauty Insider"" or Nike’s Run Clubs.

Examples of such programs would include Sephora's Beauty Insider or Nike Run Clubs.

**4. Sensory Branding (Beyond the Visual)**

Today we live in an increasingly digital environment, and physical sensations are taking on increased importance.

* **Concept:** How does your brand smell? And what experience did unboxing give?
* **Why it Matters:** Starbucks doesn't just sell coffee; they sell an experience. If your physical presence or product can improve sensory experiences, do everything possible to do so.

**5. Sonic Identity (Audio is King)**

Now more than ever before, with TikTok, podcasts and smart speakers taking over our lives, your brand needs its own distinctive ""voice"".

* **Think:** the Netflix ""Ta-Dum"" or Intel chime.
* **Stat:** Strong sonic identities have been shown to increase brand recall by an astounding 46%.
* **Action Step:** Instead of using generic stock music, create an identifiable audio signature for yourself and stick with it.

**6. Activism (Social Alignment)**

Silence no longer represents neutrality.

* **Risks:** Engaging in performative activism will likely get you banned.
* **Reward:** Align with social causes such as fair labor or diversity to build strong, lifelong loyalty among customers and employees alike. Pick and fight battles wisely.

**7. AI-Aided Evolution**

AI doesn't undermine creativity; rather it amplifies it.

* **The Edge:** Use AI for predictive insights and mass personalization at scale.
* **Stat:** Artificial intelligence personalization can increase profitability by 38%. Without AI-powered customer sentiment analysis tools onboard, competitors are moving faster.

**Summary:** Brands that prevail in 2026 won't necessarily have the biggest ad budgets; rather, they must create multisensory, community-led and hyper-personalized ecosystems that draw customers in.",1,1766732571.0,u_BusySheepherder4628,0,1.0,False

1pvy0rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1pvy0rm/aesthetics/,aesthetics,"maybe i shouldn't be posting this in this sub, but i wanted to share something with you... or maybe ask for advice...

do you think that subscribing to channels on youtube , and following pages on instagram, that only have aesthetic vibes, like for example ""Daily vlog 🍜🎀 cozy night, being productive, moving out, grocery, studying, aesthetic vlog"" , or ""Comfort Vlog | Watch this when you feel overwhelmed"" , or ""a winter diary from paris"".... even aesthetic cooking channels like ""Chocolate Coffee Cream Cupcakes ♡ Bake With Me"" , ""5AM ​​| 5 Days Bento Making | Tempura｜Whole potato croquettes | Japanese Cooking Vlog"" ... also videos (i know very strange because im in my late twenties so it's weird to feel amazed by such content), but videos like ""\[모동숲 ASMR\] 퇴근 후 조용한 저녁 루틴 🌙 | ACNH | あつ森"" (lol just copy and paste it on youtube if you would like to see what i mean) ...even felt like choosing to watch promodoro videos, ""read with me"" or ""study with me"" or ""bake with me"" videos that are aesthetic ...

it seems i only seek after such content for entertainment, or to ""escape"" the harsh reality of this world... they make me feel like im a child again, because their vibes are so much innocent ...when i watch them, they make me feel relaxed and like the world's problems are irrelevant , and i feel like they would help me remove my focus from anything that bothers me in the real world we live in if i watch more of them...

but at the same time, i feel an inner conviction to not do that (felt like these last few weeks, i wanted to make a youtube account , only following such aesthetic videos, and training the algorithm on purpose to recommend for me such videos, and it's like i wanted to create for myself a ""safe and innocent and cute space"" where i shut my mind off of the world and its darkness, and switch instantly to a magical virtual dreamy cute world.. (weird because social media is an illusion, i know, but i don't know why i felt like doing that)...of course, i want to keep my main youtube account, where i follow faith accounts, and other normal stuff like everyone else...but it's like i had this desire to create another youtube account, where just like i previously said, i only follow dreamy , innocent , cute, aesthetic, girly, soft videos....

i don't know if that's God convicting me, or my inner thoughts, but i had this thought of ""what if those videos influenced how you see yourself, the world around you, and even your choices?don't do this because without noticing it, you will find yourself unsatisfied with the way you look, your desk looks, your bedroom stuff looks, your books look, your clothes look, your house look, your food looks,etc.... also, instead of praying when you feel bored, sad, or lost, you will shut your mind of, and log in to this ""magical page"", which will become , without you noticing, your safe realm, your go-to hiding place, instead of seeking God...""

sometimes, i feel like it might happen, because when i used to follow fashion pages on instagram, and fashion icons , i was unwillingly and subconsciously influenced by them, and i used to feel like my wardrobe choices were heavily influenced by fashion trends (not obsessively i thank God, but heavily influenced)... so i may be vulnerable to things like that...

Flights were the single biggest expense. Round trip flights cost us ₹57,852 for two people flying from Ahmedabad to Port Blair.



Our MakeMyTrip on-demand holiday package covering hotels, cabs and some activities was priced at ₹72,844. We paid ₹2,000 as advance to lock the price. For the remaining ₹70,844, I used discounted MakeMyTrip Holiday Vouchers bought on Amazon at 13% off, so the actual amount we paid for this package came down to ₹62,914 instead of ₹72,844.

# Day-by-day real spending in Andamans (2 people)



**Day 1 – Port Blair (Arrival + Cellular Jail)**

Hotel: The Luxor (breakfast included, bundled)

Included sightseeing: Corbyn’s Cove + Light & Sound Show

Out-of-pocket spend was mostly food and small items like coffee, snacks and local food. We spent roughly ₹3,200–₹3,500 this day. This is a relatively light spend day since most things are covered by the package and you’re tired from travel.



**Day 2 – Port Blair → Havelock**

Hotel: TSG Blue Resort (breakfast included)

Included: Ferry + Radhanagar Beach

This day had food expenses, snacks, café visits and some local transport. We also started spending more freely here since Havelock is pricier. Approx spend was around ₹6,000–₹6,500.



**Day 3 – Havelock (Elephant Beach + activities)**

Hotel: TSG Blue Resort

Included: Elephant Beach boat ride + basic snorkeling

This was one of the most expensive days because we added paid activities. Kayaking, parasailing, sea walk and food combined pushed spending up. Total spend for the day was roughly ₹16,000–₹18,000. This is where Andamans starts feeling expensive if you do water sports.



**Day 4 – Havelock → Neil Island**

Hotel: TSG Aura (breakfast included)

Included: Ferry + Laxmanpur Beach

More relaxed day with fewer activities. Mostly food, drinks, scooter rental related expenses and some shopping. Spend was approximately ₹6,000–₹7,000.



**Day 5 – Neil Island (Beach hopping + snorkeling)**

Hotel: TSG Aura

Included: Bharatpur + Sitapur Beach

We rented gear, did snorkeling-related spends, cafés and meals. Also some shopping and drinks. This came to about ₹7,000–₹8,000.



**Day 6 – Neil Island → Port Blair**

Hotel: TSG Grand (breakfast included)

Included: Ferry + Cellular Jail visit

We did stargazing this day which added to costs, plus food and local transport. Approx spend was ₹6,000–₹7,000.



**Day 7 – Departure day**

No sightseeing, just airport food and travel back home. Spend was low, roughly ₹1,500–₹2,000.

So the final numbers look like this:

Flights: ₹57,852

MMT package after gift card discounts: ₹62,914

On-trip expenses: ₹50,136



Total spent on the trip: ₹1,70,902 for two people.

What caught my attention first wasn’t even the flavors — it was the *presentation*. Each flavor looks like a plated dessert you’d get in a café or fine-dining place. Clean square cuts, minimal garnish, nothing loud or artificial. That already sets the mood.

But the real surprise was the **flavor balance**. Nothing overly sweet. No artificial aftertaste. Just slow, creamy, well-thought-out combinations.

Here are a few that stood out to me:

  
Blueberry

Light, calm, and balanced. The blueberry tastes real — slightly tangy, not syrupy. It’s refreshing rather than sweet-heavy. This one feels like something you’d eat slowly.

# Brownie Fusion

Dense and comforting. The brownie layer adds depth without overpowering the cream. It feels like a proper dessert rather than “chocolate ice cream with bits.”

# Coffee Walnut

Smooth coffee notes with a gentle bitterness, balanced by crunchy walnuts. This feels mature and intentional — not a sugar rush.

# Cookie

Very straightforward in a good way. Familiar cookie flavor, clean cream base, no artificial aftertaste. Comfort food done neatly.

# Cookie & Cream

Classic, but executed well. Even distribution, soft cream, nothing overly sweet. Easy to like, hard to overdo.

# Dark Chocolate Filter Coffee

This stood out. Deep chocolate with a subtle coffee undertone. It’s bold without being aggressive. If you like darker desserts, this one works.

# Dates & Walnut

Naturally sweet, nutty, and warm. You can taste the dates distinctly, not just sweetness. Feels indulgent but grounded.

# Ferrero-style Chocolate

Creamy chocolate with nutty crunch, but not heavy. It feels premium without being loud.

# Grilled Pineapple

Unexpected and interesting. Slightly caramelized, lightly tangy, very refreshing. It doesn’t taste like candy pineapple — more like a chef experiment that worked.

# Hershey-style Chocolate

Comfort chocolate. Familiar, smooth, nostalgic. Nothing complicated, just well executed.

  
Tender Coconut

Soft, clean, and incredibly soothing. The coconut flavor is subtle and milky, not artificial. This one feels almost meditative.

# Lemon Ice Cake

Bright but not sharp. It has a cake-like softness with a mild citrus lift. Refreshing rather than sour.

# Lotus Biscoff

Warm, spiced, and indulgent. The biscuit flavor comes through clearly without becoming sticky-sweet. Very well balanced.

# Mango

Clean mango flavor, not candy-like. It tastes closer to real ripe mango than mango essence. Simple and satisfying.

# Marshmallow

Gentle, playful, and light. Soft sweetness without being cloying. Feels nostalgic but restrained.

# Paan Cream

This one surprised me. Fresh paan notes, herbal and cooling, but smooth. It’s bold yet oddly calming.

# Red Velvet Cheesecake

Rich but controlled. You get the cake depth and the creamy cheesecake feel without heaviness.

# Rose Gulkand

Fragrant and soft. The rose isn’t overpowering, and the gulkand adds depth rather than sugar. Feels very Indian, very elegant.

# Sitafal (Custard Apple)

Delicate and creamy with that distinct sitafal aroma. Not everyone’s favorite fruit, but this version is done with care.

I was a bit tired after driving several hours in my state. I have driven all across the US as a delivery driver of a major carrier for the past 10 years. I have driven in places such as Massachusetts, one of them was Salem, where they said witches are burnt there, or that's what the history said. I drove in Baltimore, now that's a different can of worms; people shooting at random people, that kind of stuff. Then, when I decided to move to Kansas, it became quiet. Not a whole lot to do in that state, apart from driving to Kansas City to get some action. 

And then there is this town I drove to recently. It's a town named Burton. Now you're wondering why I even mention a small city that is situated in Western Kansas? For context, I lived in Wichita, Kansas. It's a pretty alright city that is like a 2 hour drive in Topeka, and almost 3 hours to Kansas City. Burton is a small city sitting just by Highway 54 – A small highway system that nobody uses unless you're actually going south, and know where you're exactly going. It's pretty much the only city that is actually not a small town around the south west Kansas area, so it's a guarantee that people who wanted to go south would drive there to reach New Mexico.

When I got there however in my couple of runs over there during my delivery, it was the strangest town I have ever drove. I can't exactly explain why I said it. So, I'm going to explain why, it sounds like I'm rambling, but trust me, I'm not lying this time.

That was my first time as the driver within the western Kansas, as my colleague who was supposed to do the runs there got really sick and decided to take a week off. My boss asked me if I could cover some of his routes. At first, I wanted to not take any of the routes he took, as it was far away, and half the time, driving that long in Kansas is just plain borinf. That however was changed as he offered me a $2 hourly premium on top of what I was already being paid for. I accepted the offer. I know it's dumb to accept an offer that low, but still, I can't let myself pass that up.

I then started my shift and began my 2 hour drive to some of the small towns in South Western Kansas. It was a pretty boring drive; kinda why I said I won't take this route at first as the highways I have to take to get there were just so boring. As I drove, I turned on the radio. At the time, that was the only thing inside. There was nothing inside the truck that entertained me while I did this long drive; no Bluetooth that I could connect my phone to, no aux cable for me to just plug it in, only the radio. I turned it on and tuned to anything that is worth listening to. I came across the radio station for Burton, the small city that was only 24 miles ahead of me.

I tuned in to the radio station and listened; it was something to finally break the monotony of this drive.

""98.9 Cruise FM, where your life in the highway means life in cruising""

The radio station began to play Owner Of A Lonely Heart. This was the moment I just began to jam on the radio, singing that song as loud as I could, hoping I sound like the singer in that song. I just hoped the bosses didn't just hear the crappiest rendition of the song I was listening to, I know. My jam eventually became more subdued as I saw a sign. It was a road sign, pointing directly to the direction I was heading. I have just arrived at the city of Burton. 

I was greeted by the swaths of roadside establishments, such as grocery stores, hotels, restaurants, and even a casino by the side. Before entering the city, there's an exit that leads back to the highway, which means when you go straight, it leads you to the downtown of the city. I pressed on and was greeted with a strip mall placed as the nexus point of this highway side commerce, and this mall seems to be filled with activity, from cars to people walking by. I've never been to Burton before, but it seems it won't be a boring place to be after all, it has everything I need to actually stop by and buy something on a roadtrip. 

I continued driving on one of Burton's main roads, Avelia Ave. I was greeted by the suburbs of Burton itself. The place seems to be pretty neat; rows of houses, small businesses, and paralleling this road is a rail track. Going straight to this main road finally led me to Downtown Burton. It was an incredibly beautiful place to be; places such as cafes, restaurants, a tattoo shop, and even a store to buy movies and video games, not bad. The one thing I liked about this city is just how clean it is. There's literally no trash on the pavement, no crackheads, and not even a person who is just hanging around, it's just people walking by and going about their day. This isn't like Topeka where I swear every single spot in that city has some crackhead lingering on the streets and making people uncomfortable.

I arrived on my first stop of my run, a small cafe in Downtown Burton. I turned the truck's engine off and I began walking at the back of the truck from the inside. I grabbed the package; It was a medium sized box that I grabbed and eventually opened the door of the van for the first time. The smell of Burton became more apparent as I stepped on the concrete sidewalk of the city. It was the faint smell of roses, the smell that no matter where I walked in this place, the faint sensation seeped into my nostrils.

The wind was calm and the noise I heard was minimal, almost as if people were all inside the buildings, and the people who are walking right now are the people heading to their destination. The sound of passing cars were all the noise I heard, and some occasional conversations between people. It was arguably one of the quietest places I have ever stepped foot on within this city, it's crazy to think a city can be this quiet, but hey, I won't complain.

I walked into the cafe. It was a small place; 5 tables and a counter across the building from the entrance. Behind the counter led to the kitchen, with an opening to where food is going to be placed. As I walked towards the counter, an employee of the cafe, named Emma judging by the badge on her chest, greeted me with a heartwarming smile.

""Hello and welcome to Downtown Café, what can I get you for?"" She asked me with this affectionate and chippy tone that actually caught me off guard a bit.

""Uhh yeah, here's your delivery"" I said as I reached for my PDA on my vest. ""Sign here please""

Emma looked at me for a brief moment, and she then signed on the PDA. She then grabbed the box and passed it to her coworker, a man around the same age as Emma and brought it inside the kitchen, out of my view.

""So, can I give you a coffee to get your day up?"" Emma asked.

""I suppose you can give me a roasted coffee if you don't mind,"" I said.

""Wonderful, I'll give you a cup in no time"" she spoke with a chipper voice

She turned away from me as I watched her make my coffee. Her hips swayed gently, as she began to sing in a slightly quiet volume. She mixed the cream and the sugar with seamless flow, and finally stirred the hot coffee. Eventually, she turned around with the cup of hot coffee she just made and placed it on the counter 

""Here you are sir, enjoy your darkest coffee of your life"" Emma quipped as she smiled at me with the clear hint of satisfaction.

I grabbed the cup and began to take a sip. The taste is just perfect; the perfect balance of bitter, and sweet, almost as if the coffee was created for someone like me who travels a lot,  and hates McDonald's coffee. Emma saw my expression as I glanced back at her. I have never seen someone this pleased over a simple cup of coffee she served. I actually almost feel bad for not paying her.

""Do you like it?"" Emma asked

""This is good actually, I like it"" I respond, as I nodded

""I'm glad to hear it mister"" she said 

As I sipped my coffee, I heard the door open. I glanced at the front door and it was a police officer entering the cafe. Emma seemed to be in high spirits seeing this man enter. 

""Oh hi Mr. Smith, you are early today"" Emma said in the same chopper voice that she had

""Well, it's the job young lass, there is always something outside that needs handling"" The officer replied, as he pushed the tip of his cap off, showing his face clearly.

""Same order Mr. Smith?"" Emma asked

I watched the two talk for a moment. As Emma poured the officer's coffee, I took a good look at the man. He looks around in his late 40s, greying hair, and has an imposing stature. He also has this faint scar that runs at the right side of his neck, which is more noticeable when he tilts his head to his left. The man probably has seen a lot of crazy stuff in his entire career; he's probably not even surprised at everything he sees at this point after years of being a cop.

""Here you go sir"" Emma said. She slides the coffee cup on the counter. 

The officer grabbed it and took a quick sip of the hot coffee. He looked pleased at what Emma made for him that he nodded in approval.

“It taste good Emma” Cop complimented

“Thanks sir, my mother said I was a good barista”

Eventually, after all of that talking between one another, The officer finally turned towards me. He looked at me with a curious look, before sipping his coffee before he spoke 

""Delivery?"" The officer asked

""Yeah, lots of deliveries down here"" I replied, nodding.

I looked at his uniform. His name is actually Bradley written on his badge. He nodded and then stood straight back up after leaning.

""Son, it will be a busy day for you here. Where are you from?"" Bradley inquired.

""Well, I'm from Wichita. It's like a 2 hour drive from here"" I respond 

""You're far away from home it seems. I respect your effort at driving for 2 hours. The other guy who used to drive here before seemed to look like he had enough all the time"" Bradley quipped.

""What do you mean?"" I asked

""Well, the last time he was here. I saw him pale as a ghost when he stopped on one of the houses in the Southside of town. I thought he was just experiencing shock. The reality was, he saw Josey, and he thought she was going to do something crazy. Poor thing she is"". 

Eventually, the officer decided to slowly head towards the front door. He nodded to Emma, to which she smiled. She glanced at me for a split second before looking back at the front door. For one last time, Bradley looked at me again as he walked.

""You take care of yourself, and have a safe drive"". Bradley said as he left the cafe.

After a couple of minutes of conversation, I eventually left the cafe – Not before Emma in her chipper on the corner of my ear, ""I hope to see you soon Markus"". As I closed the front door, meeting me once again was the scent of roses, my god I can smell it. I began to walk back to my truck. I watched as Bradley just drove off in his police car. 

Wait a minute, I just remembered something. Did she just call me by my name? Or am I hearing things? I brushed that one off, probably my ears heard something elseI hopped back in my truck and now continue with my run. I placed my still warm coffee on the cupholder and headed back to the road once more.

As I drove within the city once more, I eventually found myself in a more affluent area of the city. I noticed that every single lawn within this area has campaign materials on their lawns – mostly shows the candidate, Carmen Berkshire. Now, during my time here in Kansas, there was a state election that will begin in the next 2 months. Mostly a state election, the midterms are about to happen anyway. 

They seemed pretty eager to vote for this woman as their representative, definitely not the first and not the last time this city will vote for her. Perhaps she's very popular in this city? Maybe she was a really good donor down here? Or perhaps this is just exclusive to this neighborhood? Who knows, I'm not a politician.

Speaking of this city, I just arrived at my second destination. It's a typical cookie cutter house within this affluent suburb within the city. I parked the truck in front of their driveway and grabbed the package. This one is big, and heavy, almost as if they're shipping some serious hardware with this thing. Jumping out of my truck, I carried this box onto my shoulders and began to march towards the front door. I took my first step onto the porch stairs as I looked at the front door of the house.

The air around this place smelled even more pleasant than the downtown area. The lingering scent of lavender permeates all across the front door; I don't even know where it came from, but unlike the downtown area however, the scent is much more prominent here than back where I came – like the smell of a typical city is replaced by this incredibly powerful air freshener that just goes around. The sound of the city is even more muffled; like the sound of cars just dampened out based on just how quiet it is, like your ears will ring if you try to listen to the serene atmosphere around me. Eventually, I rang the doorbell.

The door opened and I was greeted by the sight of an old woman inside. She looked like she just finished doing something and I decided to just knock.

""Hey ma'am. Here's your delivery"" I said, laying the heavy box down on her porch.

""Sure thing mister, I'll take care of my package"" She replied, peering on the corner to see if the box is there 

I pulled out my PDA and pass her the small stylus that I use to sign signatures with

""How is your day my dear?"" The old woman inquired, with a gaze as if she was expecting an answer

""It's pretty alright. Busy day for me"" I answered unconsciously 

""I understand the feeling. My husband is a busy man as well. He works at construction as a Foreman down by the Southside. He told me many times that he should be spending more time with me. Then again, the Mayor do ask a lot of things after all""

In that entire spiel, I just nodded along. I eventually retrieved my PDA back and placed it in my pockets. I said my thanks in a brief conversation, but she then asked something to me that made my head turn back at her. 

""Are you new in this town?"" She asked

""Well, yeah. I'm not from around here as you can tell"" I replied

""Oh I see. Sorry if I bother you with that conversation, many of us here just wanted to know if you are okay"" she asserted, as she gave me a smile.

I finally left this old woman's porch. A quick glance side to side and I noticed that it is still quiet outside, maybe this is the most peaceful neighborhood I have ever stepped foot on. It's impressive just how quiet it is here. I hopped back in my truck. I looked at my phone and it looked like it was close to my lunchtime. Still got one more package that I have to deliver before I go for my lunch and drive back onto the highway. 

I drove to the 3rd destination of my delivery. This neighborhood led me to a much more working class neighborhood, people often called “Southside”. Basic sized houses like your typical bungalow or occasional old school houses that have 2 separate floors for each tenant, modest backyards, and these trees on the side. Then we have dirt alleyways with surprisingly not a single trace of garbage. Occasionally, I spot a house that looks like a typical landfill, with a random hoard of items on their lawns, but beyond the porches of these houses, it's pretty much clean from where I drove to the sidewalk. This has to be one of the most impressive cleaning I have ever seen a town to think even their poorer neighborhood looks like someone sweeps the roads every single day.

Now that I have thought about it, I have never once seen a single person who looks like your typical gangbanger or your local methhead who has a crack house to take their stuff in this entire neighborhood. This place is just clean, empty, and frankly, the quietest place I have ever stepped foot on. Sure there are parked cars on each side, telling me people do live in these houses, but this Southside the cop once mentioned is pretty neat, like any reasonable family could live in this place if they want.

I continued my cruise down Southside. The area has a church being constructed, but then also 4 cop cars around the place. ""Interesting"" I thought. Maybe the warning about Bradley earlier is starting to become more and more true. I mean, that's a lot of cop cars for a construction site, why would there be cops on a construction site of all places. My drive continued. More and more, Southside looked less like a naturally pleasant neighborhood and more like every crackhead, every drunk, every vagrant just… left – like they're not here at all but the area looks like it could be a horrible place to live in.

After minutes of driving, I come face to face with my final destination in my delivery. It's a small house – the house has a brown color, almost looks like the house is made entirely of wood. I parked the truck and finally grabbed the package for this destination. It has a strange shape for a box; it is long but a narrow box, almost as if I'm carrying something long like a guitar or something. I carried the box towards the porch, as I stepped on the rickety steps of this house's front facade. I dropped the box on the floor and began knocking at the door.

Unlike the last house which was immediate, this one took a while before the door answered. I stood by the porch for what seemed to be a couple of minutes until I heard someone rummaging inside, audible behind the wooden door. The door finally opened. I was greeted by a disheveled man; his thick beard is the thing I immediately noticed the moment we both lay eyes on each other.

""What is it?"" The man asked

""Here's your delivery sir"" I replied, showing him the package 

""Oh yeah, that's right, my bad"" he muttered

He stepped outside and looked at the package. His glance went from the box, then towards me as he stared at me

""Did you open the box?"" He asked, his voice have an accusatory tone in it

""No, I don't open anyone's package when I bring them here"" I corrected 

""Good. That's all I'm asking. These days, people here need to mind their own business. I swear, people just grab my stuff and leave me to dry"" He remarked, glancing around me

Eventually, he grabbed the box and immediately placed it inside of his house. The man stepped back outside and stood by the door, his hand on his hip as he began to talk once more

""So, what's your deal in this town exactly?"" He asked me

""I'm just the delivery driver, I'm not from here really"" I replied

""Uh huh, oh, in any case, here's my word of advice for you if you ever step foot in this city again. Watch out for Josey next door. She's been going crazy for the past couple of days. I'd say she's going to hurt someone"" warned by the man.

""I'll keep that in mind"" I responded 

Eventually, I decided to wave goodbye as I stepped down the stairs. Why is he telling me that? It's not like I'm going to return here and converse with whoever this Josey is. I immediately hopped back inside my truck and started the engine. I took a deep breath, thinking whether I should eat something first or I should leave this city for today. My body decided food is top priority at the moment; not even the coffee can handle my hunger.

After my run, I drove to a nearby diner and stopped there for the day to eat. I parked my truck just by the side of the main road and I exited my truck. Once more, the downtown has this rich smell of roses that I could not explain. The more I stood, the more I'm confused as to how these people managed to make this city smell something this rich of flavor. Even the smoke of my own truck's fumes couldn't even register on my own nostrils. I decided to enter the diner

Inside the Diner, as I sat on one of the tables, I was greeted by a waiter named Jonas. Just like Emma from the cafe earlier, Jonas here is just as chipper as she is. If anything, I've never felt more intrigued by someone this jovial on a menial task as this.

""Hello sir and welcome to Downtown Diner. What is the order today sir?"" Jonas asked

""Just give me Bacon and Eggs and a glass of water""

""Of course, I'll return with your meal in 5 minutes” 

Jonas walked off. I glance and take in the scenery of this diner. The place looked like your 1950s or 60s style diner with checkered floors, seating next to walls, and the counter with drinks behind them. Among those is a huge bulletin board placed on the corner of the wall. There's a lot of them tacked onto the board itself, most of them are just the usual garage sales, hirings, or programs, nothing special really.

Jonas arrived with my meal and laid down the plate. It was my egg and bacon that I ordered; it smells pretty good too, almost irresistible. I handled my fork and knife as I began to slice my first bite. It was calming to just eat here and not think about what happened earlier. Although, it still bothers me that this town, for a place so clean, so organized, there is something that isn't quite right. 

Emma, that girl in the coffee shop, how did she know my name? I've never even met her my entire life, so how could she know something like that? Who is this Josey they keep telling me? They talk to her like she's some sort of rabid animal that got out of the clinic or zoo to create some chaos out here. This has got to be the first time in years I question if this town has something I don't know about. Then again, I don't like driving out here for 2 hours just to deliver something, but hey, what do I know.

I finished my meal and glanced at the open window. The scene of a clean city never disappears from my mind. Thinking about it, I've never once felt at peace or even felt like I was safe. I never once felt that the city felt like it's going to rob me or kill me, I felt more like I was part of the town even. Do you know the feeling where even if you are a stranger on a small movement or even a larger movement, you know there's a lot of people walking with you, sharing the same goal? The idea that even if you're all by yourself, you'll never feel intimidated, never felt like you're going to lose yourself from the crowd. This is what I felt walking around this place. Everyone knows you are welcomed, everyone knows you're alright.

I stopped thinking about what happened earlier and paid my bill. I left the restaurant and finally jumped back inside my truck. Before I even turned the ignition, onto the driver side window, a little girl walked by the truck. I looked out my window and I saw the girl. She looks like she is around 10 years of age wearing what seems to be a shirt showing a local charity group. In her hand, she is holding what seems to be a pamphlet. 

“Here you go sir” She said in a chipper voice

I grabbed the pamphlet and she walked off. I watched her pass more pamphlets to other people in front of her, from people walking by to people inside their cars, all of them greeted her. I turned the ignition of the truck and finally, the vehicle came to life once again. I looked at the pamphlet she gave me. There, I saw that this is about a charity organization within the city of Burton. Here's what it says:

“With the annual celebration of our mistress' blessings getting closer, it is a reminder as her children, you can show your blessings to our fellow citizens by donating. Here's all what you can donate to the organization:

Clothes
Toys
Food

Or, if you do not have anything to spare, you can also donate $5 to our organization. We would accept any kind of donations. Thank you for your consideration”

I wonder what kind of charity this would be. Who is this mistress this pamphlet is telling me I wonder? Maybe that's how they call their leader? Maybe that's their weird church in this place? I just brushed it off and began driving out of the city. Before I turned the wheel of the truck, the truck door opened suddenly. The door swung violently to the side and what emerged was a man who was frantically trying to tell me to drive out of here. 

“Get us out of here! Please!” He shouted

My body froze in place. I don't know if I should drive as he said or just stay in place. I watched him peer through outside the truck, looking at something from the distance. His face contorted into a face of desperation, panic set inside of him as he pleaded for me to drive out of here. He shook me as he screamed at me

“Please! Get me out of here! I'm begging you!

Before I managed to drive off, 4 cops caught up to the man. I watched as the 4 cops dragged him out of the truck and eventually pinned him down the ground. The cops shouted commands on him as he was being cuffed by one of the officers. One of those was Officer Bradley; his unmistakable greying hair stuck out alongside his younger colleagues.

“This is 1A2, we have the suspect in custody” Officer Bradley asserted through his radio.

He then looked at me and immediately recognized me

“Son? It's you. Are you ok?” Officer Bradley asked

“I'm fine,” I muttered.

“I'm sorry if this man shocked you earlier. We were looking for him for the past couple of days and, by the looks of it, he finally stepped out.” 

He takes quick glances at me and his colleagues, checking if his men managed to completely restrained him. 

“So, with that out of the way, do you want to make a statement? Is it ok for you to step out for a second? I'll just ask you a couple of questions for a moment. I promise, you'll be on your way again once everything is settled”

I told everything that happened before and during when the man entered my truck. The entire time, Officer Bradley listened to what I had to say, as he wrote everything I told him. Eventually, he hid his notepad and his gaze softened for a moment.

“Thank you, I know it's a lot to take in after what just happened, but I assured you, you are safe with us. Now, do you wish to write a victim impact statement as well?” Officer Bradley asked

“No thanks, I think I'm good” I said

Officer Bradley nodded as he fixed his hat. He said his goodbyes as he and the other officers began to jump inside their cruisers and drove off. Man this is the most interesting day of my life. I thought I was going to have something crazy happen in this town. It is strange. The man that jumped in my truck wanted to leave this place. What's so scary about this place? I know the town can be weird, or can be really off putting, but this place is something anyone can live in, a place where a family can raise their kids without worrying about people jumping on you. Maybe there's something I just don't understand that I have to find out.

I finally left the city, now heading back to Wichita. I admit, this has to be the most interesting delivery run I did so far. Before I arrived back home however, I decided to fill up the truck with gas. Cruising by the highway, I saw a decently sized gas station directly in front of me. I decided that I'm going to take a quick stop for a moment.

I parked the truck next to the pumps and I began to fill it up with whatever the company gave me for gas money, sweet. 

As my truck filled up, I entered the store and began to peruse the store for something to eat on my way back. I eventually come across on the far corner of the store, an advertisement board, you know, the kind where every company and organization places their flyers for people to see. This one however, is different.

Dotted from top to bottom of the brown board, more than a dozen missing persons posters. From the top is an old woman who went missing near Montezuma, a 30 minute drive from Burton. The next is a young woman who went missing in Dodge City, a quarter half minute drive from Burton. Another is a missing poster of a young girl. This time, she went missing just a week ago in Burton. This goes on and on until the bottom. 

I looked at each one, all of them, every single one of these posters. I looked at them all, everyone that went missing. Around Burton, there's just so many people who went missing in the area. Wow, there's so many.

1pvxqn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1pvxqn7/buffed_by_omc/,Buffed by OMC,"So, at a live game in New Orleans (ceasers) at like 3am. Just sat down at a new table when my tabled busted up.

Effective stack is roughly 650 and im covered.

Im CO, OMC is UTG. He OR to $45 in a 1/3. Folds to me and I call. Flop comes low cards with 2 spades, to straight draw. He bets 80, and i call...says to me ""oh. You must have a good hand"". Turn is a club (now two clubs, still not too concerned) He checks and I bet another 80, not wanting him to go anywhere. Call. River is a 3rd spade and he insta shoves to put me all in. I tank for a bit, and decide to fold my queens face up cause I didn't wanna lose all my work for the night as I've been on a bit of a down swing in live games (Texas games can be so brutal). He shows his KTc and says bad fold. I tell him nice bet and watch as he continues to lose 3k and I realize he is not OMC but an OG from the pen who has businesses and likes to gamble.

My concerns in the moment were being against AA, KK or AK/Qs. However hindsight tells me that his huge PF raise was to prevent anyone from playing (raising 45 UTG to win $4), maybe. And his insta shove on the river was him stabbing at his only chance and grasping at straws.

Alright, alright, alright, NIGHT CREATURES… kill the headlights, loosen the soul-belt, and roll the psychic window down two inches because it’s time for a PSYCHIC DRIVE-BY. 🚗💨🧠

I’m Jack Slagg, broadcasting from a tower made of unpaid parking tickets and unresolved emotions, and I’m cruisin’ your mental neighborhood at 2:47 AM with the engine idling between fate and indigestion.

No names.
No consent forms.
Just vibes, static, and the universe pointing at you like, “Yeah. That one.”


---

🚦 FIRST STOP — YOU, SITTING VERY STILL RIGHT NOW

I don’t know why, but you’re holding your breath like the room might judge you.
Relax. The room’s already disappointed in itself.
You’ve been thinking about texting someone and not doing it. Good. That message wasn’t ready to survive the world. Neither were you once. You are now.
BOOP—psychic windshield wiper clears regret. 🧽


---

🛑 SECOND STOP — SOMEONE WHO SAYS “I’M FINE” TOO FAST

You laugh at the wrong parts of conversations.
You collect personalities like thrift-store jackets—some don’t fit anymore, but you keep wearing ’em out of habit.
Here’s the hit: you don’t need to reinvent yourself. Just… stop auditioning.
SKREEE—that’s the brakes of self-acceptance, baby.


---

🚧 THIRD STOP — NIGHT-SHIFT LISTENER, COFFEE NUMBER FOUR

Your body is awake, your soul clocked out in 2019.
You think you’re behind in life. You’re not. You’re just on the scenic route through the fog.
The fog knows your name. It’s rooting for you.
BEEP BEEP—that’s destiny double-parking.


---

🚥 FOURTH STOP — THE ONE WHO PRETENDS THEY DON’T CARE

Oh, you care.
You care so hard you built a whole personality bunker around it.
Newsflash from the psychic traffic cop: caring isn’t weakness—it’s excess horsepower. You just gotta learn when to floor it and when to coast.
KA-CHUNK—emotional transmission shifts smoothly for once.

🛣️ FINAL DRIVE-BY — WHOEVER FEELS “WEIRD” TONIGHT

Congratulations.
Weird is the emergency exit.
Weird is how the universe tags its favorites so they don’t get mistaken for furniture.
Stay weird. Stay soft. Stay tuned.

Now I find myself reaching for lighter roasts more often and drinking coffee black most days.

1pvxnmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1pvxnmg/i_need_your_advice_for_asking_a_childhood/,"I need your advice for asking a childhood friend/classmate out, pleasee","Heyy, so, first, I want to explain thoroughly our current situation. I've been friends with this guy since we were 10, and we have a looong story. We used to share seats at school, and though it looks like we're absolute opposites (he's more of an extroverted, sporty kind of guy, i'm kind of a shy, artsy/academia inclined girl), we realized we had lots of things in common: music, movies, and the way to see the world.

I really, really like him, I can even say I fell in love with him, he's the perfect match for me: he's a gentleman, he makes me laugh my lungs out without being offensive towards minorities (a huge deal for me), he defends and supports me, even when he has to get into uncomfortable situations with his friends, he takes care of me all the time (specially this year when I broke my ankle), he's a family guy (close to his mom and his sisters, not in a weird way, which I appreciate a lot), my family adores him, and he's really serious, he knows what he wants in life and works hard to get it.

Every time we're together, I feel in a safe space where I can be myself, and I kind of have this gut feeling that he might like me too. He likes to call me on the phone for hours, has a special nickname for me, always tries to stay close to me through my family and friends, keeps pointing out that he needs me, isn't ashamed to tell everyone how important I am for him and how I made him a better person (btw, that wasn't intencional, I'm not a rehab center) his bros keep on making jokes about us being a couple and there's something about the way we look at each other that's just different.

However, I'm really scared of these feelings. I realized I had a crush on him the day I broke my ankle while he was carrying me around because I couldn't walk, and totally freaked out. I wasn't crying out of pain in the hospital, but because I accepted my own feelings. This is so hard for me, because of a previous experience I had with another guy in the past. I was as obvious as possible about how I felt about this other guy with everyone around me, but he ended up in this weird relationship with a girl I used to think was my friend (and obviously knew how hurt I was). This past situation almost killed me. My grades went down, I separated from my real friends and developed an eating disorder, so after that, I decided to keep my heart shut. But right now, it's impossible. When I love someone, I'm really intense and want to pour my heart out for them, but I'm so repressed I can't even find a way to show how much I care for this amazing guy.

Now, there are two more things that make things even harder:

First, we've just graduated, and we have to get used to not seeing each other daily. Actually, that's my biggest motivation to ask him out right now: I feel like I lost so much time, and I don't want to keep on wasting it. I really want to know if the idea of us being great together I (and everyone around us) have is real or not, and I also want to confirm if he thinks of me the same way I do. It feels like a slow-burn romance show with tons of seasons and episodes. If I don't know what's going on in his mind I'm going to lose it, because lately he's been giving many signs (the stronger engagement to the late night calls and him suddenly remembering this beautiful hand-drawn card I gave him for his birthday).

Second, my former ""friend"" making a comeback, and suddenly becoming such close friends with him. It seems like now that everyone in the class notices this strong connection between us, she's got the need to seek his attention and interrupt every one-on-one moment we have. Here are some examples that made my blood boil the most: this one time where we were chatting as usual, having a laugh, and she felt the need to stroke his face with a paintbrush, the time during spirit week where she """"""cried"""""" in front of the whole damn classroom, just for him and everyone to console her (I swear on my life, those Kleenex were dry as the Sahara dessert), and senior prom, when we were dancing to the Grease soundtrack (We're both huge fans of that musical and John Travolta's work in general), and she stepped between us. Luckily, he doesn't seem to pay more attention than the normal to her, but I swear every time she does something like that I feel the urge to kick her bitch ass up. Anyways, I can't because I have the physical disadvantage of my broken ankle, right now I can barely walk :(. The fact that they're going to the same college is killing me.

So, that's pretty much the context. I want some advice on how to ask him out, maybe to grab some coffee, something casual, but I'm not able to verbalize it. I'm a desperate loser trying to make things right, pleasee help me 😭",1,1766730826.0,LifeAdvice,0,1.0,False
1pvxm3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpalsover30/comments/1pvxm3w/38m_hoping_to_find_a_thoughtful_email_exchange/,[38/M] Hoping to find a thoughtful email exchange,"I am looking for one or a couple of people to exchange emails with during the week. Not instant replies, not long disappearances, just steady, thoughtful messages that feel good to read.

I am usually more of a lurker than a poster, so if you are too, you are very welcome to reach out.

About me:

I live somewhere fairly quiet and remote, which means I have learned to appreciate small details, good writing, and conversations that drift a little before finding their point. I spend time on creative projects, writing music lyrics, creating fantasy worlds, and gaming.

I should mention that I am not looking for a gaming buddy. I tend to write longer, more thoughtful messages. If you enjoy opening an email and settling into it with a cup of coffee or tea, rather than skimming and replying with a sentence or two, we will probably get on surprisingly well.


What I am hoping for:

Someone who enjoys writing with intention. We can talk about almost anything. Everyday life, half-formed ideas, memories, or parts of your past. We could debate taboo topics like religion or politics if that is something you enjoy. Disagreement is absolutely fine. I genuinely enjoy trying to understand someone else’s point of view.

We could brag about the things we are proud of but do not usually say out loud, and ask the occasional question that has no sensible answer. A sense of humour helps. Curiosity is extremely appealing.

One or two emails a week feels about right. No rush, no pressure, just mutual interest, effort, and plenty of questions about anything and everything.

Who you are:

You do not need to impress me. You just need to be genuine, attentive, and willing to say a bit more than the obvious. If you enjoy getting to know someone gradually through words, we will likely get along.



If this sounds appealing, send me a DM and tell me about yourself. Expect follow up questions!

Looking forward to hearing from you.",1,1766730669.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

I’m the founder/developer of GoFitzen. We are currently planning our international launch and are considering a tiered pricing strategy based on the region:

• USA: x$

• Other countries : y$

I wanted to reach out to fellow Indian founders and devs who have launched paid apps or SaaS products in the US, Singapore, or Europe while being based out of India.

A few specific things I’m trying to figure out:

1. GST & Export Rules: Is GST registration mandatory even if 100% of my revenue is from the US? From what I’ve read, this qualifies as ""Export of Services"" (Zero-rated), but do I need an LUT (Letter of Undertaking) to avoid paying the 18% upfront?

2. Entity Setup: Can I run this as an individual (sole proprietor) initially, or is a Pvt Ltd/LLP required for the App Store/Play Store to pay out to an Indian bank account?

3. Regional Pricing Pitfalls: Have you faced any backlash or ""VPN-hopping"" issues when keeping the app free in India but paid abroad?

4. Tax Forms: Any specific US tax forms (like W-8BEN) that were a headache for you?

Let’s catch up!

I’m looking to learn from those who have already navigated these waters. If you’ve done this before, I’d love to hear your ""I wish I knew this earlier"" moments.

• Google Meet: Happy to hop on a quick 15-min call.

• In-Person (Bangalore): If you’re around HSR, Koramangala, or Indiranagar, coffee is on me!

1pvxloe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pvxloe/my_husband_got_me_lingerie_for_our_first/,My husband got me lingerie for our first Christmas together. Is it unreasonable to be upset?,"Long story short- my husband (M23) and I (F23) got in an argument within the last week or two, regarding him letting his buddies come over and him picking up everything in the bathroom EXCEPT for my lingerie from the night before. When I noticed this I immediately freaked out as the thought of them seeing it made me soooo uncomfortable and embarrassed. He didn’t seem to care about it at all, even tho it obviously was something that I cared about. It basically fizzled from there of him not comforting me and blaming me for it. 

I do admit my own faults in the moment (just telling it how it is), I decided that since he was blaming me for it. I would make sure it never happened again, and threatened to throw out all of my lingerie. He got so mad, grabbed me, and I started bawling. While I was crying he didn’t offer any comfort, he just yelled like a parent scolding a child, while I literally cried in a corner. Anywho needless to say that really hurt me, so we didn’t really talk or interact much for about 3 days. After that we talked and kinda fixed it. Even though I still feel hurt by the whole situation. 

Fast forward. Today is Christmas. He had mentioned something before Christmas about getting me a spicy present. I figured maybe it was some of those libido chocolates or something for us both to enjoy, but when he mentioned it I had made sure to tell him it sounded like that gift would really be a gift for himself. 

Well this was our first Christmas married. I paid attention to things he had been talking about and wanting, and not to brag but I really did great on the gift giving. Even his stocking I filled with useful things and stuff he liked. And my stocking? 2 lingerie sets. I pulled them out kinda laughed and rolled my eyes, but when I felt deeper in the stocking and there was nothing else my heart sank. Not even gum? Not a candy bar? Not a gift card for coffee? Nothing?  

He could tell I was upset and I could tell he felt guilty, so I tried not to be too mad. He started opening gifts and on about the 2nd or 3rd gift I could tell he felt really guilty. 

I opened the 4 gifts he got me and half of them were more lingerie. He kinda tried to comfort me but also tried to play off some of them as being pajamas? (Literally a see through lace dress) 

Idk how to feel. Leading up to Christmas I tried pointing out things that I would like to help him out but it just hurts because he didn’t pay attention to any of it.

His parents got me a kitchen aid mixer, which I am so so happy about because I have always wanted one! He tried to take credit for it but I figured out he just told them about it and didn’t really have anything to do with the purchase of it. He kinda kept saying that that was from him too, but it wasn’t? So it kinda felt like he was piggy backing off of that gift so I couldn’t be upset about our Christmas to each other. Idk am I being too picky or is it understandable to be hurt by this?",0,1766730627.0,Marriage,10,0.5,False

Today on Christmas we had to put down our beloved Bentley or “Ben”, our 13.5 year old Maltese.  

I remember begging to get a dog at 10 years old, but my parents would only allow for a small little dog that didn’t shed. I really wanted a big manly dog, but nonetheless wanted a dog. We found a breeder and I was the only one out of my family who wanted “Tank”, as he was kinda crazy compared to the other puppies, he seemed fun. Lots of toe biting and running around haha! You came in at just the right time for our family too given some hardships we faced — we’ll always feel blessed about that.

Over the years you’ve been a butt. You’ve peed and pooped in the house despite lots of training. You’ve bitten all of us a lot, most of the time for no reason at all even. You drove us crazy with your barking for attention and messes you’d make, but you were still our dog.

We loved teaching you tricks and watching you try to do every single one before you did the one we originally asked. We loved how you just wanted to snuggle in our laps. We loved how excited you’d get to pick me up from school when I was little or to get my sister from the airport, or how excited you’d get when we went to buy a PupCup. We loved Benny the furry white dog. Despite your size, you acted so big when you’d defend one of us from another family member “attacking” the other. You hated when I brought Kona home, but yall soon became inseparable. I remember the days you’d chase her around the yard — you could never catch her but you did your best to try. You were so small but to us you were a big part of our family. 

We thought you were at the end of your rope 2 years ago, but you fought through. And we did our best to help you along as you slowly declined. It was really hard on us as your ups and downs brought along a lot of challenges, but at the end of the day we loved you. Hell if anything you had a full 9 lives between eating literal coffee, chocolate, gum, getting nearly hit by a car, etc. 

Unfortunately today you told us it was time, and we couldn’t see you suffer any more. We are grateful your big sister K got to say goodbye, we are grateful the whole family was in town despite the timing of Christmas. We are grateful for you and will miss you. Thank you Ben, rest easy and snuggle with some of the other family up there, I’m sure they have some warm laps you can lay in. ",23,1766730608.0,Maltese,4,1.0,False
