I inherited this plant from my grandmother who recently passed away. She loved her plants but was unable to care for them when she got sick. It was much larger before but the main part died and these leaves are all that’s left. Also the skinny stem in the dirt is still connected to the roots. The thicker stem is dead but I left it hoping it would help identify it. 
I’m hoping to save this plant and keep it in remembrance of her. Unfortunately, I’m getting a lot of mixed results from my online searching so far and I scared to make it worse. I thought it was a type of monstera but I wasn’t sure the leaves had enough color variation in them and they aren’t Swiss leaves so 🤷‍♀️. Any advice in saving this plant or identifying it so I can do some research on how to care for it would be very helpful. Thank you to everyone in advance!! 😊",1,1737852526.0,PlantIdentification,0,1.0,False

1ia1rrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1ia1rrz/siren_thesis_part_23_family/,Siren Thesis. Part 23- Family,"Part of a few short stories, with the intentional purpose of exploring a group of ""branches"", or ""test sites"", that have developed a new branch of Azur Lane dedicated to fight landbased Siren forces.

Summary:

Doctor Bethencourt and Song, the wisdom cube-born girl, are preparing for a small trip to the civilian side of the island in which the Azur Lane's base resides in. The Doctor seems to have his own plans and reasons for the trip, but so does Song, which has been looking for an opportunity to get closer to some of the Kansen at the base.

[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1i4l50r/siren_thesis_part_22_waltz_on_azure_lanes/) \-

////

Doctor Bethencourt had spent the better part of two days running tests on the siren machines he brought with him from his facility. While accompanied by the Azur Lane personnel, doing something he enjoyed, namely showcase his creations and discoveries, it was obvious for those present that the repetitiveness of the tests had started getting to him.

Truth be told, while interacting with the personnel as well as a few of the more research oriented Kansen, he suddenly had some interesting insights on what actual -nurture against nature- would look like in a more scientific oriented scenario.

*An interesting idea for some future experiments.*

His mind had been preoccupied with such ideas that he was actually caught by surprise when one of the girls at the base came and informed him that their trip to the city had been approved and was currently being arranged.

The city in question was located on the other side of the island where Azur Lane’s base was set on, providing lodging, necessities. Such necessities being either those that would be available at a small pharmacy, as well as those that would come from going to a mall, or even from visiting a small coffee shop in order to take a break, reading the Saturday morning press, sensationalizing news and comic strips included.

The city offered more than anything a solid foundation of “normalcy” to the inhabitants of the island, including both those that belonged to some military or governmental faction that offered support to Azur Lane.

As such, the sense of normalcy only came from the fact that the city functioned pretty much the same way as an ordinary city would do so. Similar to any city with a big military base, with the exemption of how many people dressed in uniform was casually strolling the streets, as well as the not too uncommon sight of Kansen merrily going their way on attires that were more often than not, hardly proper, if one was inclined on being generous on the description or their choice of clothing.

The trip to the city was, in itself, something the Doctor had wished for Song to experience. Thus, the very next morning he had woken up the girl with the intent to visit the place. He had immediately started describing all of the possibilities of what could be found, as well as what she was meant to do in the case of an emergency or should they, for whatever reason, begin their plans much earlier than anticipated.

 

“ *<All those plans, all those warnings. And somehow the very first thing we did after waking up before the first light is to move to a city. Just to grab a pastry and some coffee?>* ” The little girl questioned, speaking in Irisean, as they were wont to do when they were alone.

“ *<Well these are not any regular pastries. Dunkerque praised these highly. It would have been a real tragedy had we not come to try these out.>* ” Doctor Bethencourt replied as he took another bite of the delish apple, viennoiserie, and sugar-cinnamon-crust concoction.

For her part, Song could only raise an eyebrow at that, it was true that the pastry was among the best she had tried since they had arrived to Azur Lane, but even if it had been the best, somehow being a better confection than those that Dunkerque usually prepared, she was certain that the purpose of their trip wasn’t focused on food and niceties.

“ *<I don’t quite understand what our purpose here is>* ” She finally said as she took a bite of her own pastry.

“ *<Well, to start a great day with some delectable baked goods and good cup of coffee, obviously>* ”

“ *<I-… you are not going to give me a straight answer about this, aren't you?>* ” The little girl narrowed her eyes as she looked at the doctor.

“ *<Not likely, no.>* ” The doctor said before taking another sip of his coffee.

This answer brought a wry smile from Foch, the only other person among those accompanying them that could fluently speak Irisean. While she hadn’t participated in the conversation, she was standing rather close to them, playing the part of a bodyguard. Knowing that there was someone else that could understand what they were speaking about made Song feel a little bit more uncomfortable than she was willing to admit. That as well as the Doctor’s subtle gesture that this particular Kansen was more than likely a spy of sorts, made her all more uncomfortable than she could bear, scheming and intrigue were the doctor’s forte, not hers. 

Feeling that their options for safe topics of conversation were reduced by this, Song decided she might as well concede and continue with whatever plan the Doctor had come up with.

With their “battle of wits” coming to an end, with Doctor Bethencourt sipping his coffee and Song begrudgingly eating her pastry with an obvious pout to her mouth, they quickly wrapped things up at that place, promptly joined by others. Among those accompanying them were a handful of Kansen as well as regular human personnel from the Azur Lane base. They got onto one of their service vehicles that had been assigned to them and made their way onto their next destination.

It didn’t take them long to reach the main destination, a shopping mall set in the middle of the civilian side of the island. The way the doctor had explained things to Song, it sounded like he intended for her to experience yet another facet of civilian life, and come to a better understanding of what the lives of the regular people were like. Somehow, he planned to achieve this sort of insight by having her come on a shopping trip, which she found highly unlikely. Then again, the Doctor had brought many unlikely plans to fruition before, as such Song was willing to at least give him the benefit of the doubt.

 

As they stood in front of the parking lot, at the entrance to the shopping mall, Song made a quick recount of those that were accompanying them. From their own “camp” those present were Doctor Bethencourt as well as Doctor Soriz, who had been mostly unseen while in Azur lane, the female scientist quickly excusing herself from any sort of “social” arrangement made by the commander or the Kansen at the base, by engaging in either work or her own choice of activities in which the Kansen and food more often than not took a big part in.

From the Saruka Empire, Azuma had joined them. After their first day at Azur Lane in which she had more than likely made her way to the Sakuran dorms, very likely in order to share her findings regarding Song, the Sakuran lady had made herself rather persistent in her presence in any sort of impromptu event in which Song had been present. Song couldn’t fault her for it, there was a certain mutual sense of comradery from both of them, with both of them having been given a life and a mission, with barely any real history to back up their existence.

Avrora, from the northern parliament had joined them too. Which was in itself somewhat of a surprise, as they had very little interaction with their faction before. Both her predictions, as well as the Doctor’s didn’t really include any real meddling from the Northern Parliament. With the faction holding a rather inclusive focus on any event, if not too self-centered perhaps. Avrora’s insistence in participating in this trip had come as a real surprise. Not that Doctor Bethencourt hadn’t anticipated such a possibility, he had very briefly displayed that amused smirk of his, showing that such events were unlikely but not wholly unexpected.

Foch, from the Reformed Iris orthodoxy, more likely than not, assigned to this trip by her superiors, either by Richelieu or Clemenceau.

And last, but not least in importance, Bismarck and Mainz, from the Reformed Iron Blood. Both accompanying them as well as functioning like bodyguards. Which then again could be said about all the Kansen present, as well as the human personnel from Azur Lane, which were more than likely some sort of special forces from their country of origin, at the very least.

All of them were wearing some sort of casual clothes, which did wonders to blend with the people in the mall, at least on a more natural sort of way, as the Kansen seemed to draw attention regardless of their choice of attire, more than likely due to their stunning looks.

“Well here we are,” Doctor Bethencourt said as the group stood in front of the gates of the mall, with people passing by, some looking at them but most simply going their way into the building.

“Our main objective is to check on basic necessities, at least on paper. The real purpose of this trip is to enjoy ourselves and waltz around the place.”

Song couldn’t help but roll her eyes at those instructions. Those were some rather vague rough strokes about what could be done as well as the Doctor’s usual tendency to be dramatically cryptic.

Nevertheless everyone just took his words at face value, with many of them nodding in agreement and soon began talking among themselves about what they wanted to do or which options were available within the mall.

 

To Song’s surprise the mall was much more than what she had initially expected, all the information she had looked at up within the network had showed her countless pictures of various malls, while she had focused mostly on those from within the Eagle Union, there was nonetheless a multinational arrangement present, as a result of the island being the base of operations of Azur Lane, meaning that there were various influences on the stores, the variety of goods offered, as well as the people present, giving as a result a much more colorful scene than what she had initially expected.

Then again, with Azur Lane being primarily managed by the Eagle Union, she expected much more fishing and hunting shops, as well as a cartoonish beaver offering a plethora of barbecue-oriented foods roaming around the place.

Her inner musings had quickly come to a halt when she realized they were standing in front of a clothing store with mannequins displaying various arrangements of children's clothes.

“Eh?!” Song was taken aback when she saw two hands extending towards her.

Azuma as well as Avrora stood in front of her, each one at a different side, obviously inviting her to come along with them to the store. The gesture wasn’t lost to Song, she had seen it several times while browsing the network regarding stuff like family trips as well as shopping, the fact that every Kansen had come to the trip in regular clothes, rather than their usual attires, had made this scene look so much more like those in the videos she had seen. But seeing it in front of her had been a whole new experience. Even if she had no real interest in acquiring new clothes, the invitation on its own had been something she hadn’t experienced before. As such, before she even had time to fully process the implications of going into a clothing store the with two doting Kansen, she found herself extending her own hands and holding those of Avrora and Azuma, she focused much more on that particular moment, before she could fully realize that she was being lead into the store.

Probably one hour later, although Song’s sense of time had told her it had been more, and she felt like it had been many more, the two Kansen had gone through every option they had laid their eyes on. Song for her part felt like she had undergone some sort of weird trial in which two aunts would dote all too hard on a kid they had met for the first time. She wasn’t quite sure if she had emerged victorious or not from that.

But at the very least she had obtained three sets of clothes that gave her a somewhat giddy feeling while she was wearing them. The commentary and praise she got from the two doting Kansen also helped her decide on which clothes to pick, truth be told. Azuma, especially, had become pretty immersed into detailing which styles could go along with which clothes and what sort of -feeling- could be ascertained from certain ensembles. Song wasn’t all too sure about any of those things, but she figured that if the others were sincere about this, then there was a grain of truth to what they were saying.

As such, she counted the whole ordeal as a somewhat of a victory.

Song couldn’t help but to notice that the girls playing the role of companions as well as bodyguards had decided to change groups. With Bismarck and Mainz coming back from their small trip along with Doctor Bethencourt. The two Ironblood ladies nodded towards Azuma and Avrora, with the latter now engaging in some small conversation with the Doctor. The former, now heading her way, with Mainz holding a cup of coffee, sniffing at it and twisting her nose as if unsure she agreed with the contents of the paper cup, standing at a reasonable distance from the bench where Song was sitting and now the leader of the Iron Blood was also taking a seat right beside her.

“I must say, this sort of trip is not a bad thing.” Bismarck said.

“It has been an interesting experience so far” Song nodded as she looked at the tall blonde sitting beside her.

“There is much more than we would need, if this was a regular trip for goods. But sights on themselves make for some sort of entertainment, as well as being informative on current trends.”

Song could only nod in agreement, she could see how every single store within the mall offered much less than a specialized store, markedly in terms of quality. Mainz would probably agree with such a statement as she still seemed in disagreement with her coffee.

“Anyway, what did you want to talk about?” Bismarck said as she turned to look at Song.

“Eh? How?!- I mean, what-”

“You have consistently asked for me, since the day you arrived. Not directly, but the insinuations haven’t passed unnoticed by others” She stated calmly.

“Was it Vestal?”

“It was Vestal” Bismarck replied.

Thinking about it, Song chagrined internally, realizing that it probably hadn’t been the most covert action to ask Vestal if the leader of the Iron Blood was seen often within the medical facility of the base.

*Well off with it then. Not going to waste such a fortuitous opportunity even if it comes as a result of my own inexperience.*

“I think there will be a point where either the Doctor or myself, will have to make a choice that neither of us will like.”

“Doctor Bethencourt might not look like it, but he is much more intelligent than he seems, he is also a schemer.The plans he has made, I am sure he will purposefully give the wrong impression to most people, or even unwittingly, but anyway his actions would surely immediately deem him a demon.” Song said as she bit at her lower lip.

“He is already capable of creating weapons that, back in a not too distant past, would have been more than enough to conquer the world. It only requires the wrong impression on someone for the Doctor to be immediately branded a villain”

“Mmmm… Can you share any of these plans?” Bismarck asked as she looked pensive.

“Not really.” Song said as she shook her head “I have only vague ideas about what his intentions are at best. But while I am uncertain of the nature of his plans, he is truly a genius, but he has a penchant for playing the part of the -dark hero-.”

Bismarck thought about the little girl’s words. She expected Song to breach a subject similar to this one, but she hadn’t given enough credit to the reports that she had read about the girl. Song was truly keener than the reports gave her credit for, her childish appearance most likely had given her much discredit in this regard. Although, her concerns were very much like those of a child concerned about their parent, without an inkling of what they could really do to be of assistance.

“Like a -Dark hero-, I see… I think I have come to a better understanding of what manner of issue you have” Bismarck said, calmly closing her eyes deep in thought.

“So, you have a solution for our problems?!” Song asked excitedly.

“No. Unfortunately there is no pre-made solution for such complex situations. But I have a suggestion.”

“Eh? What could this be about?”

“You don’t have to rush for a solution. You can take some time to process the events unfolding in front of you, even while they might seem completely immediate, there is always some time to make a rational decision. Open yourself with your family and make your concerns clear. You don’t need to come to a solution immediately. To be able to explain yourself and give yourself some time to process all the things happening is plenty enough. With your efforts combined on a single front, you stand a better chance of finding a solution that’s right for you and your family.”

“Eh? What are you?-” Song replied as she listened to the Iron Blood’s leader. “B-but I don’t have a family?”

In response to this, the leader of the Iron Blood raised an eyebrow as she looked straight at the child sitting beside her.

“Do you not consider the doctor your family? From what I have heard, the two of you are rather close.”

“We- I guess we could be called close. But- but I was created from wisdom cubes, I am not human, I am not related to him, not like a true family…” The little girl said as her head dipped marginally.

“Has doctor Bethencourt ever called you a -creation-? Or maybe something different, like ‘weapon’ or ‘prototype’? anything that makes it sound that you are not really human?” The Towering Leader of the Iron Blood asked as she tilted her head inquisitively.

“N-No! the Doctor has never!” The little girl stammered as she answered back in bewilderment over such a question “He has even found it hard to try and explain my existence, since he is forced to use words as ‘non-human being’ or ‘non-human organism’, which obviously bothers him. We… we often tease him about it…”

Bismarck hummed in response to that. She seemed pensive for a few moments before producing a silver pocket watch from her pants. She moved her thumb over the small accessory a few times before opening it, inclining it in such a way that Song would see it too, revealing that it was in fact a small compass.

“One day, both Herr Claus and Friedrich asked of me to go visit a certain town in the motherland. It was a weird request they made to me, and it was during a time in which I felt truly overwhelmed with both our work as well as the actions we had taken back then within the -Old Iron Blood-. So I went my way, hoping this was a mission that would at least distract me enough from my inner turmoil.”

“The place was a remote coastal town, with nothing seemingly of interest to it, nor remarkable enough that could have made two of the leaders of our reformed country to ask of me to visit it.There, I met a man who had been waiting for me to arrive. He had served on the Bismarck, the one made of steel, gunpowder, and national pride. He welcomed me as if he had found some long-lost family member, he gathered friends and family alike and made a small feast in my honor. He shared with me food as well as many stories of his comrades and his time in service during the old regimen. He seemed truly happy to see me, even during a time I couldn’t bear to see myself in the mirror.”

“He gave me this compass, which belonged to his mentor and friend within the Bismarck. He said I should use it to know how to return back to the town” Bismarck said as she chuckled, recalling that particular moment, offering the compass for Song to hold.

“I make a point to write to him every now and then, as well as visiting him, along with my sister, if we have the chance.”

“I think that was the intention of Herr Claus and Friedrich, to show me that there are others who wish me well and care for me as family, people who I want to be related to, even if it is not by blood”

“We cannot decide when or under which circumstances we are born into this world. But we do have the opportunity to decide who becomes part of our lives, and sometimes, we also have the opportunity to decide who becomes our family. Is that not one of those privileges granted to humans?”

“I think you and the Doctor share a very special bond. And I think you are already a family of sorts, even if it might not be apparent. He is already your guardian and your mentor, after all, is he not?”

For her part, Song held the little compass on her hands, she thought that it had much more weight than it should for such a little trinket. She stared intently at it while she pondered on the ideas shared by the Iron Blood’s leader, without taking her eyes off the little silver thing, as if it could give her a more definite answer as to why her heart seemed to be both aching as well as singing to her in boundless joy.",1,1737852407.0,AzureLane,0,1.0,False
1ia1qyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1ia1qyn/how_much_does_having_the_right_hobbies_matter_in/,How much does having 'the right hobbies' matter in interviews and forming connections?,"We all know MBB/IB are some of the upper echelon of white collar office work and for a long time has been dominated by people from privileged families who went to expensive schools etc. 

It's getting more diverse now but the vast majority are still from well off/comfortable backgrounds. Due to this, you see many consultants and bankers who have 'posher' interests like golf, wine tasting, and skiing. 

We all know how much relatability matters when it comes to forming a connection during an interview or even during networking or a quick coffee chat. Having common interests can definitely help, but is obviously not necessary. 

That being said, if you have interests that aren't as...shall we say...'refined', would that put you at a disadvantage? 

For example, let's say you do boxing/combat sports as a hobby. Would that consultant or banker who is interviewing you who had a privileged upbringing and played lacrosse at Yale most likely look down on you for your 'lower class hobby'?

I'm probably over thinking it but sometimes these things matter. There's a reason why so many people in these industries are almost carbon copies of one another.

And makes small talk. This is Normal. But then it got into a convo of trying to get to know us. He says misses his baby - his wife is pregnant again and isn’t here but went out of state with the baby so she can be with her mom. Again that’s not all that abnormal and I thought oh maybe he just misses his baby but he was just like giving info and we gave some back. It seemed like he wanted to be friends I guess. I know it’s hard making friends and he wasn’t born here but he has been on the area for 21 years so idk
He said he was a bioengineer at an icu but then 
Then he had his baby and decided to work at a resort as an engineer (which aren’t the same engineering field but he said as like a maintenance guy). 
He had coffee and something else in his hands but he was in the baby section. Idk. At the end he of course was like we should meet up grab tea because his daughter was the same age as my baby. He gave my husband his number and said call me and got his number. But we are all sketched out now. 
The photos he showed of his wife (gorgeous but he way) and baby - one of them looked a bit photoshopped. 
And he was talking about how he met her at church (which is amazing) but said he met this other couple who quit their jobs to be full time parents - like if that is a choice. He said ya I want to know what his wisdom is and u have to really be around ppl who can teach you that. And said him and his wife want to be full time parents. 

Like no shit - who doesn’t want a job. But like what normal (non trust fund) human can just quit a job and be a full time parent. 
We didn’t ask about it we really just let him talk. 

Idk is this a potential scam? 
Like get into a relationship then say he needs money.  

Thoughts block him? 
Can they do anything with my husband phone number?

1ia1nkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Responsible_Dog_7973/comments/1ia1nkv/untitled_2/,Untitled 2,"as a child, (around 7-9 years old), I had an addiction to watching anime girl videos on my greasy, chunky, android, Nabi-brand tablet with the red rubber case, on which I'd bypassed the kid-friendly software to view Youtube on. 



such videos were not age-appropriate. they exclusively featured anime girls in sexual situations, and I'm certain most viewers were creepy men.



I, although absolutely too young to be viewing such content, was not at all disturbed. I enjoyed these videos. A lot. I gained pleasure from viewing these cartoon, oversexualized (and underage-appearing) girls portrayed in this fanciful way.



 I viewed the comments section for one of these videos, (it must have been some yuri video), and saw a comment describing their relationship as 'gay'. But in my 7 year old mind, only men could be 'gay'. so, I replied to the comment with some ignorant retort along the lines of ""they're not gay, they're lesbian"" and concluded it with rhetorically asking the commenter ""if they were okay"" to be sassy. they replied, explain­ing how 'gay' can apply to any same-gender relationship, before ending it with ""are YOU ok?"" 



I did various poorly-made drawings of anime girls in sexual situations, inspired by the videos. I also would steal my mom's phone to play anime girl dating RPG's.



one fine Sunday morning, I was showing my mom a cool Bratz/Barbie-doll makeover transformation video on my tablet. I accidentally hit the back button, revealing my horrifyingly sexual Youtube search history. I changed it back to the video and pretended it didn't happen, but my mom said she should take my tablet.  



I walked out of her room, then came up with the master plan of preparing my mom a surprise breakfast so that she'd forget about my concerning behavior. I poorly cooked an almost-raw egg, constructed a mocha with some iced coffee and chocolate powder with whipped cream on top, then acted cheerful when she entered the kitchen. she rejected my breakfast, suggesting I should eat it. 



I then sat down and had the most mortifying conversation of my life. she at one point asked something along the lines of ""Why are you watching sexual videos of underaged anime girls unless you were abused?"". The most embarrassing part was that I was never abused, never introduced to such content by anyone, just felt sexual feelings about it and watched for my own entertainment. Of course I never admitted to that, though. 



among the anime girl videos, I was also addicted to Minecraft. I thought the female Minecraft avatars were hot, since they looked similar to anime girls, probably. I would incessantly google ""how to get a girlfriend in Minecraft"", and avidly watched videos about the topic. I downloaded rip-off Minecraft games where you could date girls, and played them on my mom's phone. I was obsessed with the topic of ""getting a girlfriend"". I even searched ""how to get a girlfriend"" on the family desktop on Wikihow, then hand-wrote the steps I learned.



one afternoon, pretty sure I was in the first grade, I went on my mom's Mac desktop to access Minecraft. I played in a public server until about 4 in the morning. in the chat box, I told everyone that I was an 18 year old male. I sexually harassed every single female Minecraft avatar. I even remember telling these Minecraft girls that they were my ""sex slaves"" (which I censored for Minecraft chat, so it was really something like 's@x slaves'), to which someone typed ""should I report this to the police"". I approached a random female avatar to hit on, to which she replied ""I'm 12"", and called me a creep. another person in the chat typed ""you're 18, act like it"". at one point, I had a genuine conversation with this purple-haired girl while standing in lava, and I think we kissed, but this was the moment I had to leave, as my mom had just returned home from her friend's house.



I played the role of some 18 year old perverted dude, when behind the screen was an unsupervised 7 year old girl who had just learned how to read. I took quick breaks between playing to use the bathroom, and stared at my mirror reflection. my eyes were so dry from hours of staring at the screen that they grew red and watery. 



During all of these events, I didn't associate my identity with my actions. I didn't perceive any of my behaviors as gay, since my identity as a 7 year old girl was detached from what I felt and thought. I rarely felt attraction to other little girls in real life. I remember thinking that a perverted man was inside my brain and controlling my decisions.



I wrote something like ""I wanna put my penis inside an anime girl"" on paper, then felt deeply ashamed of the sentiment and crumpled it up, squirted dish soap into it, and hid it inside an empty plastic milk jug. 



I didn't see myself as male, or EVER want to be a boy. I viewed being a girl as something I just inherently am. But the content I consumed, even the yuri, was only from a male gaze. The guys lusted after the cute girls. the concept of girls feeling the same way towards other girls hadn't fully registered inside my mind.



Reflecting on these experiences made me realize multiple things, specifically how & why men incessantly exposed to cartoon, dream-like caricatures of femininity are usually not attracted to human women. It makes total sense why they would never want a real-life woman who is a human being with pores (ew), realistic body proportions (not hot), and their own opinions (even less hot). Due to the media they consumed, the idea of a youthful, perfectly beautiful fuck-doll is WAY more appealing. They do not want a human who just so happens to be a ""woman"". They don't want the burden of getting to know someone's soul, their inner world, what makes them a person. That's not hot. They want a character. A physical manifestation of femininity designed to get them off. And anime girls do exactly that.



As for the odd experience of me having those feelings as a literal child (being attracted to a caricature of femininity instead of living breathing girls) while not attributing my gender to my actions, this raises questions about sexuality itself. Do those actions make me 'gay' despite the fact I believed a man was inside my brain and felt those feelings, not me? I don't recall thinking of my gender in the first place.

When you do that, the following is guaranteed to happen:

The flight attendant trips, falls, and in doing so, inadvertently pushes on the beverage cart, sending the runaway cart speeding down the aisle.

The beverage cart will crash into the little old lady returning to her seat from the lavatory.

A bunch of soda cans will spill out and roll backwards down the aisle.

A few rows behind you, a businessman getting his briefcase from the overhead compartment slips on the soda cans and falls, accidentally hitting the guy seated across from him with the briefcase, knocking him out, and causing the briefcase to open and a bunch of paperwork to fly out.

The paperwork will land on the guy in the row behind you, startling him and causing him to spill his coffee on himself.

This will cause him to leap up and the coffee mug to fly out of his hand.

At this point, the flight attendant has gotten up and gotten the beverage cart off the old lady, but gets hit in the head with the flying coffee mug.

This causes the flight attendant to again trip and send the beverage cart speeding up the aisle.

It once again crashes into the old lady, and she gets knocked on top of the beverage cart this time. And the cart continues to speed forward.

Just then, the Captain comes out of the cockpit to see what all the hullabaloo is about, and the beverage cart crashes into him and knocks him on top too.

And the captain and the old lady go speeding down the aisle on the beverage cart together, into the cockpit, where they crash.

The plane makes an emergency landing and you have to put up the $500,000 for bond, but dont worry, you'll get it back if you show up for all your court dates.

Do you do it?

Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

We're supposed to be industry leaders, but it seems like to avoid alienating consumers, we tip-toe. I think we are missing an opportunity to educate consumers.

I think we should make drinking plant-milk easier. If someone feels like they must have dairy milk, let them take the initiative to customize their drink.

On the ethics front - Starbucks should move away from the dairy industry. The dairy industry's practices are cruel, violent, and environmentally unsustainable. 

I haven't looked into it in awhile, but I remember the last time I looked for Starbucks' animal welfare standards, I felt disappointed.

1ia1js2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1ia1js2/do_i_treat_my_body_correctly/,Do I treat my body correctly?,"EARLY TLDR- Until around the 9th paragraph I'm just giving context around the reason I'm asking this question. At the 9th paragraph, I actually talk about my eating habits and exercise routines.

I was debating putting this on mental health, because this has been a problem since I’ve been in 8th grade and think that I had an eating disorder back then (even my mom and brother do- I didn’t want to admit to any of the thoughts I had relating to food back then to the doctor so I didn’t the one time my mom made me go talk to him about her worries). But anyway, here is a rundown starting in early middle school.

I was a pudgy kid growing up, in middle school I hit puberty before everyone and got a little taller but still had the weight. One day in a gym class these two kids I was friends with told me “you aren’t allowed to play with us because you’re taller” and that was probably one of the biggest things I remember leading to a bunch of problems. 

I had no self esteem in school, didn’t play sports (until doing track and XC in my last two years of high school- partially offset by covid not letting us do sports back in sophomore year) and didn’t have friends that didn’t only play video game. Because of that joke kids said to me, I started binge drinking coffee and energy drinks. I’ve done research and don’t think that would stunt growth, but I consider the possibility, because my identical twin brother is 5’9, when I’m a quarter of an inch short of 5’7, and I started leveling off around the time I lost most of my fat. I started going to gym in the 8th grade, but never consistently and defaulted to doing sit ups and at home workouts along with running because I didn’t like the pain of weightlifting.

Between the end of 8th grade and freshman year of high school I weighed 110 lbs. As BMI went, that was underweight, borderline categorized as anorexia. The main reason I had lost so much weight was because after every single meal I had, I did 100 sit ups. Almost even immoderately after, I felt like I needed to because in my head I had a weird conception of how metabolism works, and I felt that I needed to have my body be a certain way to be comfortable.

I grew out of the sit-ups stuff around the beginning of sophomore year, but that was also when COVID started, so I was still doing primarily at home workouts, and my diet varied but it was pretty much ok. As soon as that year ended, I started doing XC and track. I ran through all of quarantine (and before that too), so I was prepared to do my first high school sport, and I did great. The only problem was the amount of food I was eating. 

I ate regular amounts of food every day (usually left overs from home cooked meals for lunch, toast for breakfast, and home cooked dinners) even though I was running 3-5 miles for five days a week. I didn’t ever snack or try to get more nutrients, which wouldn’t have been a problem besides the fact that my metabolism was really fast from when I weighed so little, and it still is pretty fast today (I’m 20 now). 

I started losing weight from all the running sports I was doing, and didn’t really care because the way I had viewed myself had worsened and worsened since I was in middle school. I kept thinking that I, a curly haired, slightly below average height, pubescent boy with body hair that didn’t see anyone else ever have body hair, needed to be super thin and almost hourglass looking.

I had (and still kind of have) a really, really, weird self view. Lots of it expanded into deeper stuff that I don’t need to talk about, because I really want to specify talk about how I’m eating now, and if I’m treating my body well. (Seriously, I don’t need a lot of input on the other stuff I wrote before it was mainly context).

I go to bed at 10, wake up at either 5:30 or 6:00. Usually, for breakfast I eat two spoonfuls of yogurt. Two spoonfuls, not scoops, spoonfuls. And a banana. And two cups of black coffee. (I have always drank it black I just like it more that way, this isn’t “dietary” or anything I genuinely like the taste)

For lunch I have canned chicken, a lot of lettuce or spinach (no dressing), chopped carrot sticks and celery sticks. I don’t usually like having carby stuff with lunch, but if I do it’ll be rice.

For dinner I have a home cooked meal, usually something with a carb, protein, and vegetable, and also dessert three to four nights in the week. The dinner I have by far has the most calories out of all of my meals. 

The exercise in my week goes like this (first is what I’m doing right now because I don’t like running in this cold and don’t have access to a treadmill): 

Monday: 9 miles on exercise bike at a pace that I finish all 9 within 38-39 minutes
Tuesday: 200 sit ups
Wednesday: 100 push ups
Thursday: 9 mile exercise bike ride
Friday: 20 push ups, 50 sit ups, 20 pull ups
Saturday/Sunday sometimes a 9 mile exercise bike ride depending on how I feel.

Also throughout my weeks I’m either working a very sedentary job for 6 hours or a very active job where I’m walking for 4-5 hours straight.

In my free time usually I am sedentary reading or playing video games.

ALSO, when I'm at university I run 3 miles around four to five days a week, and walk a LOT. 

Today, I am 139 lbs at around 5’7, is this a healthy lifestyle? Does it look like I might have an eating disorder, or like, shadows of it from where I thought I might’ve had one back in 8th grade? Or is it just me overthinking everything and am I totally ok? ",0,1737851738.0,TooAfraidToAsk,0,0.5,False

1ia1fqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ia1fqg/chemistry_differential/,Chemistry Differential,"Hi all. I’m a 35F who recently moved to a new city. I connected with a 37M on a dating app a few weeks before I made the move. We chatted for a week at which point he proposed we should meet up once I made the move. I reached out to him per our agreement and we actually met up 2 days after my arrival. He kindly offered to meet me on my side of town at an upscale bar that he selected. We ended up chatting for 3 hours. In my opinion, we had good chemistry and were able to establish a healthy flirtatious banter. We even talked about our shared desire for children when he brought up the topic of his nieces. Since we were seated at the bar, I could feel his knees grazing mine throughout the night and I made sure to casually touch his arm, back, and bicep when appropriate. He offered to drive me home and we ended the night with a nice hug in his car. I could tell he was probably too shy to go for a kiss and it’s not my style to kiss on a first date either. Immediately after getting home I texted him saying I had a great time and he said the same. He texted the next day to ask how my day was and disclosed that he went to church and spent time with his dog. We share the same religious background so I thought he would be a decent upstanding guy even if we didn’t work out. The next day he asked if I would be interested in having dinner on his side of town later that week. I ultimately agreed because he would have been working that day and I wouldn’t be so I didn’t want to unnecessarily burden him. When I arrived outside the restaurant, he immediately complimented me, which felt great given the effort I put into my appearance for the date. Dinner conversation was free flowing and easy with no awkward pauses but I noticed he didn’t ask me any deep questions about myself (for example, what I was looking for, previous relationship history, etc.). We ended up going to a bar afterward because we were the last ones at the restaurant before they closed for the night. While I appreciated that he made the reservation in advance I would have liked for him to arrange for my travel/Uber as well since he knew it was an expensive journey and I didn’t yet have a car, while he did. Furthermore, and more importantly, I knew he had the means to because he is extremely well compensated by his job. Bear in mind I had just moved and with that comes lots of expenses. This second date was 4 hours in total. Before we left the bar, he got up and suggested I get my uber while he made his way to the bathroom (to freshen up I gather). He ended up kissing me just before I got in the Uber I got for myself. I was so distracted by his lack of chivalry in that regard that I wasn’t feeling the kiss - at all.

We continued to text while he was out of state visiting his family for the holidays. He ended up coming back to town earlier than expected and called me on New Years Eve to see if I wanted to spend it with him. When I asked what he had in mind, he said he would be down to cook if I wanted to come over. He even asked if I had any allergies and what I’d like to drink since he knew I wasn’t drinking alcohol due to medical reasons. Naively, I thought it would be a chill night with some intimacy but nothing crazy considering we had never talked about physical intimacy/sexuality or anything of the sort. The first half of the evening was tame while we caught up on our holidays and ate the food he prepared. Almost immediately after getting settled on the couch, he made a move and things progressed from there. I eventually stopped things and he still asked me to stay over for the night (after saying he felt tired at 10 pm). We got comfy in bed and cuddled while we watched an episode of his favourite show. He again tried to advance things physically in the bedroom but I didn’t feel comfortable reciprocating just yet. For context, I am a virgin (which he knew nothing about as he didn’t bother to inquire) and I wasn’t comfortable doing stuff to or with him (in terms of penetration) without first having a conversation about STI screening.

I felt his energy promptly shift after I stopped him from advancing further the second time we had engaged with one another. We ended up going to bed before midnight and he didn’t attempt to kiss me when I said happy new year to him and he said the same back to me. He also didn’t engage in any pillow talk. Notably, the following morning, he didn’t make any further moves or perform any aftercare whatsoever, which was extremely disturbing and hurtful. Truthfully, it felt as though he couldn’t be bothered to engage with me at all. He didn’t even offer me a glass of water let alone coffee or food. I remained in bed thinking we’d finally be able to chat about our physical intimacy and boundaries after he returned from walking his dog but I was sorely mistaken. He only returned to the bedroom to play with his dog who had made its way back and eventually made his way to his living where he put football on and did some cleaning in his kitchen. I felt so uncomfortable and unwanted that I promptly changed my clothes and played with his dog a bit while I waited for the Uber I ordered myself. When I hugged him goodbye I felt in my heart that was the last time I would see him again. When I got home around 9 am, I called him and asked if he felt the vibe was weird to which he said no. I also disclosed I was a virgin to which he said “I didn’t know” before quickly changing the subject. He genuinely sounded surprised because of how engaged I was and authentically performative I appeared to be. The reason for my disclosure had to do with the fact that I wanted him to know that I was in fact interested in him and my lack of reciprocity in the bedroom did not have to do with a lack of my desire for him. Not once did he think to inquire about how I was feeling. Given his age and proclaimed religiosity, I expected more empathy and compassion.

I didn’t hear from him until very late Sunday night (4 long days later) by text, in which he said he had time to reflect and that he felt I was really awesome and he enjoyed our time together but he wasn’t sure if the chemistry was there. He claimed that he wanted to remain friends. I was devastated. I texted him the following night stating it was fine but that I was confused as to why he would initiate physical intimacy if he had concerns about our chemistry that he never even informed me of. Spoiler alert, he never dignified my message with a response as I had his. Even though I wanted to go off on him, I thought sending a simply worded and polite text would entice/encourage him to respond. I was wrong.

I willed myself to move on by going out on a date with another guy 2 weeks later but that experience showed me what a true lack of chemistry feels like.

This has left me feeling like the previous guy made a premature and hasty decision that was truly wrong and unfounded. Objectively, I’m a catch: beautiful, intelligent, kind, ambitious, successful, charismatic, poised, and engaging. On our first date, I got him water while he was having a coughing fit and during our second date I fixed his coat zipper as soon as we were seated at our table. I don’t know why this guy didn’t even care to bring up his supposed concern in a conversation. I don’t believe a man would be so proactive in courting me and initiating physical intimacy solely focused on my pleasure if he truly felt no chemistry at all. My gut tells me he came up with that reason because he knew it would be difficult and close to impossible to refute. For reference, he is White and I am Black. We have vastly different interests but I took great effort to learn about his past times and he never did the same for me. He hasn’t unmatched me on Hinge; however, our conversation is now hidden because of the elapsed amount of time.

I guess my question is, what do you think truly changed for him in such a short amount of time? Do you think he’ll ever reach back out to me again?

I’m hurt. I felt like we had a palpable physical chemistry and the potential for emotional intimacy as time went on. His eyes would sparkle when he looked at me. I have enough experience to know that is rare to come by in this dating labyrinth. Ultimately, I deeply miss him and unfortunately am left wishing that he will reach out and apologize for his mistakes and ask for another chance.",1,1737851405.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I've noticed that many of the coffee shops I've visited will automatically default to oat milk for the milk choice with some baristas asking/assuming if I wanted my drink ""with oat milk?"" instead of asking what milk I wanted. I've even had some baristas just assume I want oat milk and put it in my order without even asking. 

It honestly wouldn't be an issue and I don't mind correcting them that I want regular milk. The issue arises when these coffee shops are charging an extra $0.50-$1 for oat milk. The charge is understandable but adding it onto my order without even asking?? It seems shady af. Legit caught my order on the screen one time at the last second with ""+ oat milk, $1.00"" and I had to ask the barista if she added oat milk to my order, and when she said yes I had to tell her that I wanted regular milk.

When did coffee shops start defaulting to oat milk in their orders, especially without asking the customer?? It literally makes me feel crazy for thinking regular milk should be the standard and any alternative forms should be requested if desired.

Day 1: Arrival at Narita Airport then stayed at Hotel Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku. Very accessible to trains and it was just beside A1 Exit Shinjuku Station. Had our Tokyo Wide Pass (Unli Ride on JR Lines for 3 days) exchanged at Ueno Station and ate dinner at a 📍Standing Sushi Bar in Shinjuku then called it a night.

Day 2: Gala Yuzawa Ski Resort. First ever snow experience! Took the shinkansen for using our TWP. Make sure to reserve seats! Stayed at Gala Yuzawa until 2PM then went to Echigo Yuzawa to explore some cafés in the area. Had dinner at one of the best tempura omakase that we had at 📍Tempura Shinjuku Tsunahachi.

Day 3: Kawaguchiko
Checked out at Hotel Sunroute Plaza and left our luggage at the train station. Went early to Mt. Fuji for a shoot. Didn’t use our TWP because we had to be at Kawaguchiko Sta. at 8AM. Took the local train instead since the first express train going to Kawaguchiko is at 7:30AM. Checked-in at Oike Hotel and had the best time! We were able to rent a private onsen at the hotel.

Day 4: Checked out at Oike Hotel
Explored kawaguchiko! Went to the famous Lawson with the Mt. Fuji as background then walked around. We didn’t go to popular places and opted to randomly explore the area. Had lunch at a soba house with only locals and no english menu. Went back to Tokyo via express train (TWP covered) and checked in at Fresa Inn Nanachome in Ginza.

Day 5: Shimokitazawa, Shibuya, Akihabara
Did another photoshoot at Shimokitazawa then explored Shibuya. Went to Omotesando for some coffee. At night, went to Akihabara then back to Ginza for our reservation at an Omakase! Best sushi I ever had—I’ve tasted the ocean! 📍Mantensushi in Hibiya.

Day 6: Nippori, Ginza
Visited a local church at Nippori in the morning then Ginza in the afternoon. Had coffee at 📍Bongen then dinner at Gyukatsu Motomura Coredo Muromachi branch to skip the crowd.

Day 7: Disneysea Day
We loved it! Food and merch was cheaper than HK Disneyland. Then had dinner at 📍Yakiniku Azasu in Ginza

Day 8: Kamakura
Randomly went to Kamakura since its our free day! No agenda but we ate a lot at Komachi dori. Rode the charming Enoden Line and went to the seaside! Ended the night with a ramen in Ginza.

Before we start, apologies to anyone waiting for more from The Explorer.

I haven't abandoned it, but I spent almost all 2024 trying to get unstuck and it didn't do shit, so I'm just writing something else and see if it helps me get out of the hole I put myself in.

And now, to the new story. And is not going where people might think with this title :P

\[/END NOTE\]

It started as most stories start, it was just another normal day at the office.

He was chatting amicably with his colleagues while finishing setting up a couple laptops and configuring the devices for a couple new hires, a couple guys that were already on the meeting room receiving the welcome powerpoints by hr, poor bastards.

As always they never gave me enough time to have everything ready for when people joins but that was business as usual.

Then, all of a sudden, the colleague sitting of front of him just stopped mid sentence, looking at nothing, like she was lost in though.

He quickly realized that everybody was the same, just paused in the middle of whatever they were doing. For his part he was feeling the biggest of headaches, it was like the worst hangover except the pain location was all wrong, it felt like it hurt a bit behind his eyes.

Then, everybody just fell down, as if every fucking single human being had just been shut down.

He checked the pulses of everyone on his section, which was like seven people, but everyone was dead. Went to the streets and saw it full of stopped cars, since there had been the pause before the shut down there were really no visible crashes.

He checked all cars and saw them full of unresponsive, dead people.

Dead, they were all dead, and for some reason that would probably turn out to be really stupid, he was alive.

His partner’s office wasn’t far, about ten to fifteen minutes walking. ‘Thank god we are European and she just works in the same big city’ he thought, since it was practically impossible to move a car between all the stopped traffic and the sidewalk was full of bodies as well, it was peak hour after all.

He knew what he would see but he had to check nonetheless, and she was the closer of the two, his kid was on another city.

She was still and resting her head to the side, the event probably caught her laying back and looking at something in her screen. She was as beautiful as ever but she too was not breathing, neither could he detect a pulse.

So he did whatever sane person would have done at that moment. Went to the closest bar, got drunk, and cried his heart out.

Then he started the travel back to his city.

With great care he wrapped her in a sheet he stole from some store, not that anyone would miss it, and put her on the front passenger seat of a car he took ownership of.

A 35 minute drive became a 4 hours one due to the amount of cars in the highway.

Since he had all the time of the world, he would stop to move the cars to the right lane, freeing the center and left ones.

When he arrived to his home the skies were already dark and the city looked the same. Filled with people that had just stopped living for no reason whatsoever as far as he knew.

He was tired but still he carried her up to their apartment and put her on the bed. It was creepy as all hells but he would just have one more night with her. Then he thought about his son, but he was too defeated to face that particular nightmare, so he just lay down beside the love of his live and cried himself to sleep.

The next day the quietness woke him up. That tends to happen when you live with a toddler.

Then reality hit him hard, with the presence of his dearest wrapped as he left her by his side, still looking peacefully asleep.

Light and water were still working, so he had his morning coffee while his brain went to crisis mode and started creating a list of priorities.

Burying both her and their son was on top of that, he wanted to see them last now that they were still looking ‘good’ and not in two weeks or more.

First thing he did was go to the local police station, check everyone for vitals, and scream his lungs out ‘I am going to grab all the fucking weapons and open all the cabinets and drawers!’ then wait for a couple minutes.

In truth he just grabbed a gun and some bullets.

Then he needed a shovel and a pickaxe, so he went to a big shop he knew they sold all kinds of gardening tools to grab them.

Since the event happened during working hours he didn’t need to force it open, and he took some time to move the dead people aside. He couldn’t really go around burying every single human being.

Now that he had the tools and he knew the place he just needed to start, but before that he went to face reality once more and went to his kid’s school.

All the kids had been sitting in a circle and it looked like they all just fell asleep. He observed the scene from a couple meters and fell to his knees crying again.

Then, filled with rage for the unfairness of it all, went to the place to start digging the hole.

There’s this place, the castle of Burriac, that oversees the Mediterranean sea about 40 km north of Barcelona. His partner loved the trek there and the view, so he would dig her grave at its feet, looking over the cities and the sea.

It took him almost twelve hours of arduous work but the hole was deeper than his knees and with more than enough space.

The next day he went to the city’s funeral home, chose a nice coffin where his partner and kid could go, as he would have them together. The kid had been a toddler and was still breastfeeding every now and then, he would have liked to be with his mom if he could have choose.

By the moment he closed the coffin with both wrapped and her seemingly hugging the kid, he was joking to himself that he would die of dehydration cause of the amount of tears he was still crying.

Helped by strategically placed ropes and a couple of big trees, he lowered the coffin into he hole and then covered it all up. The stone would have to wait until the next day at least, they were really heavy.

It took a while to set the stone, what with him being an IT guy and wanting to find out how they did the text with laser cuts, but he was glad of how it looked. He went with black marble and gold (real gold) for the text.

It showed their dates and names and then, for her *“The best friend, partner, companion, and mother, that one could ever wish for”* and for the kid *“Gone way too soon. Love you son.”* and set the stone by the grave, at the Burriac castle’s feet.

And just like that a bit more than a week had passed and he was accepting his new reality and planning for the future. Which future? Who knows, but she wouldn’t have wanted him to give up, so he wouldn’t.

He started by occupying all the apartments of the building he lived in and using them to run computers and download both all of wikipedia, the internet archive and the wayback machine.

He wasn’t sure how long the infrastructure would hold but he would extract all the information he could before that.

He also took ownership of all unsold ipads he could and registered them with his work credentials, once the apple servers go down you would never be able to register and thus use a new ipad, and the optimist in him could visualize a future where people are using those ipads with vlc to watch some tv shows or movies found also for free on the network.

Once that was set up and it was all a matter of waiting to have everything downloaded, he started to learn how solar worked.

He broke some acquired panels before completely understanding what he was doing, but once that step was over he covered his building and a couple others with panels, so it could power all the IT equipment he had been installing.

It had been about three months since the incident when he decided he should leave his home.

He would leave it as it is, as a memento, but he wanted a bigger apartment with better views, and he knew just which one.

There was this building, just sitting there by the park, due to the city’s slope the highest apartment should have a view of the sea and looks like the balcony goes 360º through the building, that means you can also see the mountain, just walk around.

He opened the building and apartment door as he had been doing for months, accurate shot of from a 9mm police gun, straight to the deadbolt. Opens almost every door.

The apartment on the highest floor was dark, he walked towards the dinning room and all the blinds were closed, but more than that he felt as if darkness was the proper state for the apartment to be.

‘Fuck that’ he said out loud and opened the blinds and the doors to the balcony.

With more natural light he continued to examine what he had decided would be his next base of operations.

The apartment was big. The dinning room already had a big television and a couple individual couches. Much to his liking, there were books everywhere, all placed in bookshelves and bookcases made of really old wood.

The kitchen was also big and very clean, with an induction cooktop and real futurist look.

Then he started looking at the bedrooms. What he considered the master bedroom was huge, almost ten meters long with a big wardrobe and a king size bed, ‘and a lot of wasted space’ he thought.

There was another room, at the end of a hallway.

It felt wrong to approach it, he couldn’t say why, but approach it he did. Inside, there were no windows, there was just a coffin sitting in the middle of the room, with the lid opened.

He knew that whatever that was inside the coffin was alive, or at least not dead, not in the common meaning of the word. He could feel its consciousness, its presence.

So he just stood there, in the bedroom’s door.

“*I know that you are not dead, not like everyone else in the fucking world is, I can kind of hear you think. And somehow I also know that you prefer the english language so, howdy neighbor, sorry I broke your door”*

A figure raised from the coffin, just sitting, and looked at him with ice-blue eyes.

What to do?","A few weeks ago, after years of trying to address communication issues with my (27F) boyfriend (27M), I decided to communicate to him that certain aspects of communication are “boundaries” for me, and that if he does not think he can work with me on those boundaries, that was fine, but I needed him to be honest with me so I could figure out what that means for me. The “boundaries” I gave him are as follows:

* Need to be able to constructively talk about problems in the relationship 
* Need him to respond productively if I bring up a problem to him

In the moment, he said he thinks those are good, healthy boundaries and he wants those things to. He assured me that he can work with those boundaries, and that he wanted to put effort in to talk more constructively about problems that I bring up. In the moment, I felt like the conversation went well.

However, for the past few weeks since then, I have felt as though our relationship is struggling more than it was before the conversation, and I’m questioning whether he even likes me anymore.

Example: he has ceased attempts at initiating physical touch. He seems very lukewarm toward me when I come home from work, sometimes not even stopping what he is doing (playing a video game, doing something in his office) long enough to say hello to me. On our free evenings, he would rather play video games than hang out and do something together. He seems very annoyed with me at times, quick to comment or make a critical note about each mistake I make (dropping my phone, spilling coffee grounds). And it feels like any time I ask a question or say something that could even remotely be seen as critical, he gets all tense and irritated—like when I asked him if he was going to clean the shower this week like he said he was going to, or if I suggested pulling the car up a little when parallel parking to not block a driveway. If I have tried to bring any of this up, like asking why he seems annoyed, he rolls his eyes or makes expressions like he can’t believe he has to deal with my concerns again. 

I feel like this started shortly after the boundaries conversation, though at the time he did seem like he agreed with me about pursuing those goals. Can anyone provide insight on to why he may be acting this way, or advice on how to resolve the situation? 

Thank you for any and all help!

TL;DR: I communicated a boundary to my boyfriend, telling him that I need him to be able to respond constructively when I bring up problems to him. He agreed at the time and said he wanted to work on it. Since then, he has been acting distant and irritable with me, as well as generally uninterested.

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

I walked away and didn't tell the other girl. How do I move on from the situation? I was gaslighted and manipulated by someone who is seen as a savior to others.**

I don't even know where to start with this. For some context, I (**25F**) started dating this guy (**30M**) I was friends with. We had known each other for a few years and had a lot of mutual friends. He is taking me to fancy dinners, extravagant trips, showing up at my apartment with gifts, sending my mom flowers randomly. This man was going ALL out. He seemed to be the perfect boyfriend. He would show up to my apartment with coffee/treats for my friends & I, when he knew I had company over. He was always picking up the bill if one of my friends was with out with us. The ultimate gentleman. He brought up the topic of getting married and how he already picked out our kids' names.

Typing this out, I realize how insane that sounds lol. This occurred over the course of a year and a half. It seemed like we were the perfect couple. That was until he told me he had to go on a 3 month long business trip to EU. I love traveling so I asked why he didn't invite me. He freaked out and told me he didn't have the money to bring me.

The week before he left for his ""business trip"", he was acting really weird. He didn't want to see me as much. He ends up leaving, we FT ever night for the first week then his communication dwindles. I never went through his phone or questioned him throughout our relationship. I just assumed he was busy with work/stressed out, so I gave him his space. I made sure to send a text everyday just checking in but other than that I didn't do much.

I spent most of the summer with my mom bc she was dealing with stage 4 LD. So, the summer wasn't too fun for me. Not only was I going through family stuff but I couldn't even confide in my bf. He ended up coming home a day early from his trip and just showed up at my door unannounced. Looking back at it he was definitely fighting off guilt. A few weeks pass of him being super ""busy"" to the point where we only see each other once. Keep in mind he lived across the street from me. Finally, he tells me he wants to break up bc he will never be able to tell his brother we are dating. The man is crying his eyes out saying he never wanted to hurt me but he can't risk his relationship with his brother (his brother was close w/my ex). I was extremely confused. I didn't understand how this would be a relationship ending.

I'm pretty sure his brother already knew but he swore up and down he didn't. We end up going back and forth but decide not to break up. I apparently just need to give him ""time"". He was texting me 24/7 at this point, very sweet things almost like nothing happened. I knew something was wrong though, so I started going thru his IG following. I have never done anything like this in our relationship. I was shocked when I found something. I saw this girl in his following and she had just posted a story. I don't know why I watched it but it was of her on a balcony with a guy talking in the background. I freaked out bc it was his balcony and his voice. I started looking through the rest of her stuff and she had photos of them in Croatia together when he was on his ""business trip"".

I have never felt so betrayed. This man portrays himself as such a good guy. He plays almost a father figure to his friends since they are so much younger than him. He was always the one giving advice and financial help. I found out that he paid off one of his friend's gambling debt. He would constantly comment on one of my friend's boyfriend bc he was treating her like sh\*t. So, I can confidently say no one expected him to be a cheat or a liar. From what I could find he had been cheating on me for 6 months (the 3 mo. from the summer + 3 when he got back). He was juggling both of us.

I confronted him to see if he would lie to my face. He did. He tried to tell me there was no one else. Then I named her and he tried to back peddle saying she was sleeping with his roommate. As soon as I presented proof his whole demeanor shifted. He went super cold and admitted to it but wouldn't fess up as to when this all started. His true colors came out. I told him that he is lucky I don't call this girl up right now and tell her the truth. He freaked out and a few days later told me that if I said anything he was going to sue me for defamation. Well his exact words were he would ""bury me"" bc his friend was some hot shot lawyer.

We lived in the same neighborhood so we kept running into each other. It was also super weird bc we had the same friends. I introduced him to my friend's boyfriend so they made a little guy group. Our friends would have to pick and choose who they invited who to. It got really upsetting bc I felt like I was being outcasted for something out of my control. He ended up moving in with the girl he was cheating on me with.

I never told her the truth of what happened. Instead I moved away from the area so I wouldn't have anymore awkward run ins. I also stopped talking to a lot of our mutuals bc I was sick of people having to tip toe between us. How tf do I move on from this and let it go? I don't have feelings for him anymore. He caused so much damage and walked away unscathed. No one found out about all the cheating and lying. Everyone still sees him in a great light and it really bothers me. I know it sounds stupid but I really looked up to him. I loved who I perceived him to be and I wanted to be like him. He seemed like such a good person. It bothers me that I couldn't see through it.

I guess for the ppl out there who have been betrayed, how did you get past it? I feel like I can't trust anyone. I haven't dated or slept with anyone since this whole ordeal (over a year). When a guy approaches me, I am so disinterested bc I never want to be in a situation even remotely close to this again.",2,1737850616.0,relationship_advice,1,0.75,False

1ia13pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ia13pr/my_sister_is_pregnant_and_i_am_furious/,My sister is pregnant and I am furious,"My sister and my brother-in-law have a daughter. My niece is almost eight years old and there are challenges. I'm almost crying while writing this. She has oppositional defiant disorder, ADHD and is on the autism spectrum. Their entire lives revolve around caring for my niece because of her issues. It is common for my niece to have meltdowns and it leads to destruction or violence and other emotional behaviour. My niece cannot attend a regular school because of her actions towards other kids or the teachers. She goes to a special school for kids with behavioural challenges. Even taking her out in public is a challenge. My sister and brother-in-law barely even get to sleep.

I'm not asking for advice. There are child psychiatrists, special education teachers and other professionals involved. My niece gets services through the provincial government. I don't have a background in any of that so I stay out of that aspect of it. I do try to help my sister and brother-in-law where I can. I have paid for someone to go over and clean their house. That only works when my niece is at school because strangers coming around leads to meltdowns. The rest of the time I go and clean their house or do laundry and other chores. I regularly give them money or help financially. I buy them groceries or make meals. They can't really get a babysitter so I will watch my niece even if it is for a few hours so they can go get a coffee or go for a walk. I take my sister to the hair salon or my brother to a restaurant just so they can each have a few hours away. Most importantly I try to listen when they complain or vent even if they are angry. I don't judge them. I have really tried to help them as much as I can.

A week ago my sister dropped the bomb that she is pregnant. I was furious when I found out. It was not even an accident. They were trying to have a baby again. They went to doctors to get help with conceiving again. They said they always wanted two children and didn't want to wait because they both turned 35 last year. They are both acting like this is the best thing ever. If anyone asks them how my deal with a baby in the house they just say they will ""make it work"".

I am so furious I barely have the words for it. I know normally it would be none of my business if they had another baby. But there is no possible way this is a good idea since my niece has her challenges. She needs constant care. There are a constant appointments with doctors. The way it is with my brother and sister only one of them can work a full time job at once. The other has to freelance because of the care my niece needs. She usually can't make it a full day at school and has to be picked up. She hates anyone who she thinks is in authority. She is violent and has destructive meltdowns. She can't be left alone and even little things like going to the store or a restaurant are pretty much impossible. I love my niece even if she hates me and tries to destroy my car or other stuff. She's been violent at me just like with everyone else but I have tried so hard to help. I won't lie though I mostly help for the sake of my sister and brother-in-law just because of how much this rules their lives. I can't even imagine going through what they do daily.

I told them I won't help them with money or in any other way. I'm going low contact. I have been putting off taking a transfer at work that would be a promotion because it would require me to move to the next city over and I didn't want to be away from them. I wanted to stay and help but I have decided to take the transfer. I can't believe how stupid they are being. There is no way they can manage a baby on top of everything. I don't care if me calling them stupid makes me a bad person.

I can't believe them. I honestly can't. My brother-in-law's sister and father stopped helping long ago and went pretty low contact. Only his mother still helps. My parents help even though it is putting a strain on their lives. I should have followed the lead of his father and sister. I stayed in a lower paying job and gave them so much money that should have been going to a down payment. I am done now. Done. I am taking the transfer and buying a house and I will never help them again no matter what they say or how angry they get. I don't care if that makes me a bad person or selfish. I am done.

What better way to kick things off than by looking for some pen pals to chat, share stories, and exchange thoughts about life’s quirks?

A little about me: I’m a guy who’s been around long enough to collect some decent stories of my own but still young enough to keep making more. (This translates to ""I'm probably older than you and I don't particularly care about your age as long as it's above 18.) If you’re curious about my age, ask—for a non romantic conversation it shouldn't matter, right?

I’m a lover of storytelling in all its forms. Whether it’s getting lost in a good book, diving into the chaos of a tabletop RPG, or binge-watching way too many TV shows and movies, I’m always chasing a great narrative. I also dabble in writing poetry, songs, and stories of my own, though I’m convinced they’re purely for my own entertainment. That said, they’re available for others to suffer through—if you’re feeling brave!

When I’m not lost in fictional worlds, you’ll usually find me tinkering with computers, programming, or maybe getting philosophical about why my coffee never stays hot enough. I’m open to chatting with just about anyone—long messages, short quips, or somewhere in between. I do tend to be a bit long-winded (you’ve been warned!), but I genuinely enjoy hearing different perspectives.

The only thing I’d prefer to steer clear of is politics—not because it’s not important, but because I think most of us are wrong and all of us think we’re right. Life’s too short to spiral down that rabbit hole!

If you’re into storytelling, geeking out over TTRPGs, sharing your latest TV or movie obsessions, or just chatting about life’s ups, downs, and in-betweens, let’s connect. Drop me a message or reply here, and let’s see where this conversation takes us!

1ia0v4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ia0v4b/i_hate_waking_up_early_a_guide_to_unfg_your_sleep/,I Hate Waking Up Early: A Guide to Un-f******g Your Sleep Schedule,"Look, I get it. Your bed is comfy, mornings are evil, and anyone who says they're a ""morning person"" is either lying or psychotic. But here's the thing - your 4AM gaming sessions and Reddit doom-scrolling aren't doing you any favors. And no, being a ""night owl"" isn't a personality trait, it's just what happens when you've convinced your body that 2AM is actually dinner time.

Want to know how I know this shit works? The Navy taught me - by force. See, when you get to boot camp, the first thing they do is keep you up for over 24 hours. They feed you some bullshit about ""Just grab your gear, stencil it, go through these basic instructions, and then you can go to bed!"" But by the time they walk you through getting your clothes and marching you to your first berthing, it's already morning and they're dragging your sleep-deprived ass to breakfast.

Here's the genius part - they keep you up for about 36 hours for two reasons:

1. To put you in a room where Master Chiefs can yell at you about whether your recruiter told you to lie about smoking weed
2. To completely reset your fucked up sleep cycle

That second part? That's what we're going to do. Well, minus the screaming Master Chiefs.

**The Science Behind Your Shitty Sleep:** Here's something they didn't teach you in high school: The way your body wakes up is your brain sends a signal to your hypothalamus to raise your body temperature. Heat means wakey-wakey time. This isn't some wellness influencer bullshit - it's actual biology.

**Step 1: The Morning Reset** First thing you need to do? Go outside for 15 minutes. Yes, OUTSIDE. I don't care if it's raining. I don't care if you're tired. I don't care if you look like a shambling corpse. Get your ass outside before you do anything else - before coffee, before phone, before whatever the hell else you think you need to do.

Why? Because sunlight tells your body ""oh shit, it really is time to wake up!"" More importantly, it starts a **16-hour timer**. Once that timer starts, your body will naturally want to crash when it's actually bedtime, instead of at 4AM when you're halfway through your tenth YouTube video about why dolphins are actually aliens. (Which, by the way spoiler alert: they are.)

**The Actual Steps:**

1. Wake up at the same time **EVERY day** (yes, even weekends, you degenerate)
2. Go outside for 15 minutes **IMMEDIATELY**
3. No screens for the first hour (your TikTok feed can wait)
4. No caffeine until **AFTER** your morning sunlight
5. Keep your room cool at night but **LET IT WARM UP** in the morning

**Pro Tips:**

* If you're struggling to wake up, turn off your AC or turn on a heater. Your body will get the message.
* Walk around the block if you want, but do it in silence. No podcasts, no music. Just you and your thoughts (scary, I know).
* If you live in a city where morning sounds include some asshat blasting music through their garbage-bag window repair, then yeah, put on headphones.

**The Actual Science (For You Nerds Who Want Proof):** Look, I actually did my homework on this shit. Your eyes have these special cells called ipRGCs (yeah I'm not typing out that full name, fuck that) that basically act like your body's light sensors. When morning sunlight hits these bad boys, they send a signal to your brain's master clock - the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN if you're not trying to sound like a pretentious dickhead.

This SCN thing? It's like your body's DJ - dropping hormone beats to keep you awake during the day and sleepy at night. Morning light tells it ""Yo, start the party,"" and about 12 to 16 hours later it's like ""Last call, motherfuckers!"" That's when it starts pumping out melatonin - the hormone that makes you sleepy.

This isn't some bro-science bullshit. There are actual studies showing this works. But I'm not here to make you read scientific papers - I'm here to get your ass out of bed before noon.

**The Reality Check:** This is going to suck for the first week. You're going to hate it. You're going to hate me. You're going to hate whoever showed you this post. But you know what sucks more? Being 35 and still having the sleep schedule of a college freshman during finals week.

**TL;DR:** Get your ass outside first thing in the morning, keep a consistent schedule, and stop pretending your 3AM bedtime makes you special. Your body knows how to sleep - you just need to stop fighting it. Also, dolphins are definitely aliens.",25,1737849734.0,selfimprovement,6,0.96,False

With this illness we think about the past, we forget the present. We can always try to find a solution but without forgetting the present: there is happiness to be found in the very simple things of life... I think that at some point we must also accept our situation, with its limits ( my limits are great: I no longer see anyone and I no longer go out: I work from home) But I know that I am alive, that I breathe, and that I still have dreams and hopes and it is finally that's the most important...

I read through a few posts asking a similar question and there were mixed responses to each.  Now it's time for me to ask my own.  (I made this acct. only to ask this one question)

A little background info:  I live in an apartment complex and we've had the same mailman for at least 3 years (or more).  Since I was ill most of that time, I only started noticing him about a year ago when I started getting out more.  I work from home and I have been taking my lunch break and walking my dog around the same time his truck rolls around.  I've only had a few interactions with him but he's always so nice.  He always smiles or stops to greet my dog despite the incessant barking, but he gets the job done fast so there's rarely time for conversation.  He's extremely attractive with this beautiful blonde hair that he usually puts in a bun.  I'm guessing he's 4-5 years older than me.  I get butterflies any time I see him and I haven't felt anything like it since high school (I'm 30).  Even my older neighbors have commented on how decent he is.

So, what's keeping me from asking him out or leaving a note?  - a lot of things.  First of all, I don't want to make his day harder or his experience more awkward if he's taken/uninterested.  It's also the middle of winter and he wears gloves so I can't check for a ring!

A little before the holidays, I decided to leave him a tip with a thank you card.  He knocked on my door to thank me a few days after he received it, but that was it.  I feel a little stuck.  I want to ask him out, but I just don't want to be creepy you know?

If you are a mail carrier reading this, I know you guys are super busy.  Am I in over my head?  I welcome any advice on how to proceed.  I can't stop thinking about this guy.  Help help! lol ",1,1737848734.0,u_maltipoomomaj,0,1.0,False

even in the most famous examples like light bulbs, LEDs now dominate the market which are way more reliable than normal light bulbs used to be.

household appliances, furniture, audio equipment all of those are way more reliable now than back then. look at a fucking coffee machine from the 1960s those things break as soon as you fucking touch them. plastic plastic plastic everywhere. even in the most stressed parts. those things were like 160$ (corrected to inflation) nowadays the only coffee machines being made out of cheap plastic only are the $10 ones

and even if things are less reliable it's not because companies are doing it on purpose but because it's just the way the thing is build. flatscreens for example. of course less reliable then the old TV boxes back then. but that's not because Samsung or LG do it on purpose but because a flat OLED screen is bound to be more fragile. but I would still want those big OLED instead of those small ass old boxes.",2,1737848607.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,1,1.0,False
1ia0gss,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ia0gss/pennies_went_from_lucky_to_my_worst_nightmare/,Pennies went from lucky to my worst nightmare,"""You've got to be kidding,"" I said to myself after taking a drink of my coffee, which had the metallic taste of copper. I slammed my mug down on my kitchen table and was met with the sound of clanking metal against the side of the cup. I knew what was in the mug but felt too frustrated to acknowledge or think about it.

 

After a moment, I looked back at the mug. I realized it was getting absurd to have these kinds of emotions and even fear for something like this.

 

I grabbed my now cold cup of coffee and dumped it into the sink. Two pennies came flying out, hitting the edge of the kitchen sink. The sound of metal hitting metal bounced in my head like a haunting lullaby.

 

Something as harmless as a penny was slowly becoming my biggest fear. What is normally seen as lucky had become the thing that would taunt me day and night.

 

After letting my rage subside I grabbed the pennies out of the drain. Quickly walking to the nearby living room and throwing them on top of a monstrous pile of pennies currently living rent-free on my carpet. The pile mocked me. I felt so defeated. No matter what I did, more pennies just kept showing up. In stranger and stranger places. It was just weird at first, but now I can't even enjoy something as small as my cup of coffee. What did I do to ever deserve this strange curse?

 

How many pennies would you have to find before you started to feel uncomfortable? Five? Ten? Maybe Fifty? And what would you even do about it? Maybe tell a friend? There isn't much you could do about it really. Just feel oddly concerned as to how you suddenly are a penny magnet.

 

I've always been the kind of person to pick up change I see on the ground in random places. I have a little jar that I put all the loose change in and put it all in one of those little coin machines every so often to exchange for larger bills or gift cards or whatever. It always felt satisfying to see the dollar amount on the dial screen. Like a small reward for always having an eye out for those little shiny coins.

 

It's hard to say when it went from feeling like I was lucky to feeling like something was plaguing me. I remember about a year ago, going to put a handful of pennies into the jar. I had the thought of it being out of the ordinary to have so many pennies and when I looked at the jar, I realized it was almost all pennies. It was a large jar and I remembered emptying it just a few weeks back, yet, it was filled to the brim with pennies. I took it by a coin-counting machine on my way to work and was amazed. Despite it only being pennies, it was just over $100. I was more excited than confused at that moment.

 

My excitement from making money from random coins quickly shifted. What was once finding them on the floor of my house or a cup holder in my car became finding them in the sock I'd been wearing all day. Or clogging up the shower drain. In my phone case and even in a chicken nugget. Thankfully I noticed before trying to swallow.

 

I would tell people in my life about it and they would laugh and think it's nothing until they saw it happen first hand. It wasn't just something that would happen in my house. It happened everywhere I went. I got in trouble at work because I kept having to dig pennies out of my computer. My coworkers got annoyed they kept finding pennies in the coffee pot and sitting in the break room fridge. Even pennies showing up on their desks. They thought I was pulling a prank and got very annoyed after I wouldn't stop and it only got worse.

 

My friends would come over to see jars and buckets full of pennies that I collected over the last week or so that I hadn't had the time to take in. They would leave after the frustration of pennies showing up in their water or underwear. They somehow thought I was doing it. The thought of a penny curse was just too strange to believe. I wouldn't believe it either.

 

Life was still moving. Despite the inconveniences that now followed me around, I managed to keep my job and keep most of my friends. Plus, I was making decent money from this. Unfortunately, the pennies became more desperate for attention just as I was getting used to them…

 

A couple months back I got a call from my brother-in-law. My sister had unexpectedly passed away overnight. I was in complete shock. She was young and healthy. What could've possibly killed her?

 

They carried out a postmortem and I couldn't believe what they found. A penny. A damn penny. Lodged in her brain. The doctor couldn't even believe it himself when he told us.

 

""Even though we have decided that the penny was the cause of death, we unfortunately have no idea how it got there. I understand she has no history of surgery on her brain or anywhere near her head. No event that could've possibly led to a coin being introduced. We saw in her record that she had an MRI a few years back for a concussion and they didn't see a coin. It somehow made its way there in the last couple of years. She should've shown signs if something was logged for a long time."" He paused and moved in his chair trying to get more comfortable but only looked more awkward as he scooted. ""It almost seems like it appeared overnight…I know you want a better explanation for the loss of a family member, but something like this has never happened before. There really isn't a great explanation. I'm-I'm so sorry.""

 

The fluorescent light flickered in the cold doctor's office as my family and I exchanged glances at each other. I felt a deep pit in my stomach. I killed my sister. This was all my fault. I didn't directly stick that coin in her head, but whatever was responsible for the coins wasn't happy with the torture it had brought just me so far.

 

I knew it wouldn't take long for my family to start to blame me. I was already blaming myself, I just sat in anticipation as I waited for the whole family to point fingers at me.

 

""Andrew, what have you done?"" My mom whispered in a hoarse voice.

 

""No please, believe me, It didn't have anything to do with me! How on earth would I be able to do something like this on purpose!"" I begged my family as the doctor felt more uncomfortable than ever.

 

""I'm not saying you put that coin in her brain. But whatever is happening to you is now hurting the rest of us. I know you didn't do this on purpose, but I think we should keep our distance until you can figure this out."" My mom said with tear-filled eyes that wouldn't meet mine.

 

""Okay, okay, everyone needs to slow down here."" The doctor added nervously. ""What is this about Andrew being to blame? I need some more explanation."" He said as he unclenched his fist to find two pennies perfectly waiting in his palm. ""W-wait? What the hell? How did you do that? What is happening?"" He stood up in his chair and started to find pennies hiding in his clothes. He frantically grabbed three out of his pants pockets and threw them to the ground. Then one in his jacket pocket. Finally taking off his shoe and dumping one onto his desk. The poor man went running out of the office.

 

""Andrew, please understand why we need our space. You saw Katie the night before she passed. We aren't saying you did this on purpose but-"" my dad stated as I interrupted him.

 

""No, stop, I'll leave."" I wanted to argue. I didn't want my family to abandon me, but they were right. It was unsafe for me to be around them. I was causing coins to randomly spawn near me. In a proximity that I couldn't be sure of. One thing was clear. They only appeared when I was close by. I could only keep my loved ones safe by staying away. Until I could hopefully figure out what was causing this to happen.

 

I left the doctor's office in a hurry. I felt frantic heading for my house. I knew I had to barricade myself in my house. It was hopefully far enough away from other homes or people that I wouldn't endanger anyone else. Only time would tell.

 

I was in complete solitude. Acting as if I had some kind of infectious disease that I was desperate to not spread to any unfortunate soul. Even going to the extent of quitting my job, I couldn't risk the lives of my coworkers. Despite how annoying they could be. Plus, I was making so much money from the damn pennies I didn't have to work. I bought about ten of those five-gallon reusable water jugs you see people filling up at the grocery store. They would get me an average of $400 per jug and I had about three jugs per week, money was no issue. I put them at the end of my driveway and hired someone to take them to the coin exchange. They would bring the cash from it back to the end of the driveway and that's the money I've been living off of. Luckily, being around the pennies themselves doesn't seem to hurt anyone. It's me that's the problem.

 

Coming to terms with this being my new normal was hard but I settled in. I kept trying to figure out how this was happening but was only met with dead ends.

 

The main way I was staying sane was by trying to find a way out of this, but nothing. I was only met with more and more pennies. It felt like I was drowning in them. They consumed me. Not being able to take a bite of food without spitting out a little copper coin. Needing to rake them out of my bed several times a night just to be comfortable enough to sleep. The laundry machine would sound like a war zone with pieces of tiny metal flying around inside of it. I could hear the sound of them in my walls as they fell on top of a bigger pile of pennies within the drywall.

 

My time was now spent with me cleaning up pennies. Filling up countless water jugs and buckets with them in an attempt to not have my home overtaken by them.

 

I am writing this because I believe this is the end for me. Not only is all this happening to my home but to me. I went to scratch my wrist yesterday and my heart dropped as I grabbed it. A small round bump made its way out of my skin. The indent of a penny making itself known in my body. It was happening. The same end that came for my sister. I knew having a penny in my arm wouldn't be nearly as dangerous as the one that found its way into my sister's head, but this was the beginning. I could see this penny, but where were the other ones I couldn't see? Burrowing their way into my organs and nerves.

 

This morning I woke up in much worse shape than I could have imagined. Multiple pennies protruding from my arms. Not just those, but I have severe pain in random places in my body. The inside of my knee, my ear, and I think, my lung. I felt a sudden gut-wrenching pain in my mouth and looked in the mirror to find a penny lodged in the side of my gum.

 

As I lay in my bed writing this, I'm quite literally being consumed by pennies. They are covering my body at the same time they are infiltrating my body. Every hour I feel more and more random pinches of pain appear, knowing I am closer and closer to death. Now it's a waiting game to see if the weight of the copper on top of my body kills me first or if a coin shows up in just the right spot in my body to kill me once and for all.

 

Who knew something as lucky as a penny would be the thing to kill me in the end.",15,1737848593.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I've just got home from a local gig and now I'm sitting down to relax with a joint before I'm off to bed. I'm on the search for someone to have some good conversation/laughs with before I hit the hay.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1ia0fh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAB/comments/1ia0fh2/uab_food_guide/,UAB Food Guide,"I'm writing this because I personally struggled a lot with food options at UAB, and have discovered some nice strategies for eating well despite the obstacles. I recently visited a friend at a college in Cali and was honestly pissed at how good their food was compared to ours (granted, it was a private school, but for how much we pay for meal plans we should be eating like kings). Instead of moping about the injustice of UAB food, I have put together this strategy.

Some disclaimers: I'm a first-year, which means a few important things: 1. I am forced to buy a freshman meal plan, so this guide will focus on how to maximize a meal plan (but will still contain useful info for people in other situations). 2. I (am forced to) live in a freshman dorm, which has less dorm cooking opportunity than say blount or camp which come with full ovens & stovetops. 3. I haven't had time to try everything at every restaurant, so there may be OP food options I don't know about yet. I encourage others to add their advice in the comments to make this guide more complete.

**Section I: Meal Plans**  
If you're a first year (and therefore forced to buy a meal plan), you really only have one option: Green & Gold plan. Do NOT buy the dragonfire plan. ""Meals"" (as referred to on the meal plan page) correspond to a single swipe of your one card. Dragonfire gets you unlimited meal swipes only, while Green & Gold gives you 195 swipes AND 600 dining dollars. The catch is that you couldn't use up 195 swipes in a semester if you tried, so it's basically limitless swipes plus 600 dollars you can use at any on-campus restaurant. It's no surprise that you're automatically put on Dragonfire plan. Be sure to switch it before semester charges are posted.  
**1.1: Non-first year plans** (*this is from a friend of mine who is a sophomore)*  
If you are not forced to buy a first-year meal plan (non-first year or ""living off campus but for some reason wants a plan""), I recommend the $540 Dining Dollars plan (which comes with no meal swipes). *Meal swipes can only be used at the commons and the C-store, and you would do best avoiding both of those places for meals.* One thing you will notice at UAB is that most people never step foot in the Commons after their first year. This will be elaborated on later.  
In general, the philosophy of meal plans as a non-first year is to waste as little money as possible on a plan you won't use fully. The $540 dining dollars plan will allow you to eat reasonably well on it alone (if you are decent at budgeting). Usage of dining dollars will be covered in the next subsection.  
**1.2: Currencies and their usage**  
The 3 currencies are Blazer Bucks, Dining Dollars, and Dragon Cash. Check out [this link](https://www.uab.edu/students/dining/images/DOCUMENTS/Currencies_2023-24.jpg) for detailed info on their innerworkings. The main thing to know is that these currencies are 1-to-1 value with USD, so you should treat them like you would your own money. Campus restaurants are expensive and will drain your funds quickly.  
I would not recommend relying on UAB currency for every meal. Personally, I limit myself to $15 dollars a day in whatever currency I have. Getting the calories you need to be a functioning student is quite hard to do on dining dollars/dragon cash alone. The earlier mentioned philosophy of trying to waste the least money does unfortunately lead to a shortage rather than a surplus of food.  
However, stretching your dining dollars is an art which must be learned. Avoid places like Chick-fil-a or Starbucks which have a very low calorie to dollar value. But also be careful about places like Mein Bowl or Moe's, which are generally more economical, but the quality of that food is certainly lower. Mein Bowl in particular has tremendously fallen off. One last thing on ""build your own bowl"" places like Moe's/Mein Bowl is to be sure that you're getting as much value as possible. Don't be afraid to ask for more protein or more toppings. Money is tight and you need to eat to live.  
The jackpot of value is places which give you several meal's worth of food for the price of one. Vocelli's, Mein Bowl, and maybe Moe's are good options. For instance, at Vocelli's I can get a pizza which lasts me two meals for $13. Make good use of your refrigerator, left overs are your savior. Figuring out what you're gonna eat for \[insert mealtime here\] is a whole lot easier when you have a fridge full of leftovers.  
\*\*\*Keep in mind that everyone on-campus is automatically billed for $225 Dragon Cash which can be used anywhere you use dining dollars. Only 25% of this money rolls over from the end of  the semester. I recommend using up that $225 first and then using dining dollars.\*\*\*

**Section II: Procuring your own food/Cooking**  
*This section assumes that you have some amount of pocket cash/disposable income which you can use on food. If you have experience with just making ends meet with meal plans and things like the Blazer Kitchen, please share your advice so that this guide can reach more people.*  
The simple truth is that you might not always have the time/ability to go to an on-campus restaurant (or god forbid, the Commons). It's a good idea to have food (real food, not snacks) on hand so that you don't go hungry in these situations. Frozen meals (which you can get at the C-store with your dining dollars/dragon cash, btw) are a good option, and staples like rice and bread are also good. I **heavily** recommend making a shopping list of things to buy at Publix/Walmart/etc. Make sure you have stuff that is filling and somewhat healthy. This is mostly useful for weekends and weather events where the availability of food is basically zero outside of the Commons and C-store. By the way, Friday nights are especially bad as most places on campus will close at or before 5 P.M.  
**2.1: Cooking**  
College is the time to learn how to cook. Even as a first-year, knowing some basic recipes will make life way better. There's a ton of stuff you can do with just a microwave, but I really recommend getting a hot pot/air fryer/rice cooker (preferably all of these). For instance, I make myself cilantro lime chicken & rice almost every day. It's just diced frozen chicken breast thrown in the microwave then sautéed in olive oil for some color and tossed in cilantro lime sauce with some white rice, but it's pretty filling (being mostly protein and carbs). Stuff like this is honestly the backbone of my food strategy at UAB. And even if you don't feel like buying ingredients for recipes, it's still worth it to have cooking supplies and items like cooking oil/salt/pepper/etc. Whenever I go to the C-store, I always get the grilled chicken caesar salad/wrap and take the chicken out, sauté it for assurance that it's cooked through, and add my own sauces.  
If you live in one of the non-first year dorms and you're lucky enough to have an oven and stovetop, I beg you to take advantage of it. Honestly, the optimal situation is that you spend as little as possible on UAB food and cook everything yourself (not only will it save you money in the end, but it will prepare you for living on your own).

**Section III: Free Food**  
This is by far the most important section of this guide. Everything else you will probably figure out yourself after some point, but this topic is overlooked by many imo.  
There is SO MUCH free food at UAB.  
At almost any event, fair, whatever, there will be free food. At worst they will ask for your BlazerID before you can steal a bunch of food. I cannot stress how much free food is waiting for you to take it home. Honestly, you could live off of free food if your sacrificed your health. Here's what I mean:  
Recently I attended an alcohol informational event. It was just me and my roommate there, but they had entire boxes of snacks, several 2-liter bottles of drinks, and more. We ended up taking most of it to the dorm with us. Even more recently, I was at an event with free Taziki's. One person took an entire pan of pasta home with her.  
I will say that the access you have to free food increases linearly with the amount of stuff you're involved in. The more clubs, programs, and events your participate in, the more free food opportunities. Being in the Honors college helps alot as they get dedicated funds to buy food for events. I'm in a book club (which again is me and one other person) which meets every month. Because they have a budget for food and there's only two of us, *we get to ask for whatever food we want and they'll buy it for us.*  
There's even a filter on Engage (UAB event site) for events with free food. If you're willing to put in a bit of work and time, you can have a surplus of *good* food. For a myriad of reasons, UAB has terrible turnout for most student events, so there is almost always food being taken home. And they're getting way better at not always ordering pizza.

**Section IV: Diets/Vegan/Other food restriction**  
If you're on a diet at UAB, I'm sorry. Basically if you want anything other than fried chicken or pizza it's going to be hella expensive. To be fair, we're in Alabama... Anyways, finding what you can eat will be a pain in the ass, and really all you can do is identify what you *can* eat and have that every damn day. For vegetarians/vegans, most places on campus will have dedicated vegan menu items or will indicate that something contains animal products. I don't think the options are stellar, but they exist I guess. If you are a first-year, you're especially screwed because the vegan/vegetarian options at the commons and c-store aren't good IMO (the tofu at the commons is alright though) and you just paid $2500 for a meal plan which basically forces you to go to the commons.  
**4.1: Healthy Eating**  
I particularly struggled with this. I'm not on any widely-recognized diets, but just in general trying to eat healthier. As mentioned above, fried food and other artery-clogging stuff is the main show at UAB. My advice is to explore the menus of on-campus places on the Everyday app to see what fits your diet. Here's what I might eat in a day at UAB:  
Breakfast-  Acai bowl with honey, kiwi, 2x banana, and blueberries at Blenz Bowls  
Lunch- Cook for myself in the dorm (cilantro chicken and rice, eggs & rice, etc.)  
Dinner- Either cook for myself again or hunt for event food, worst case scenario I brave the Commons  
As you might notice, the only real way to ensure healthy eating is to cook yourself, which sucks because I'm paying thousands for a meal plan.  
**4.2: Not getting sick**  
There are some lowkey dangerous food places here (namely the commons). I've gotten sick once at the commons and ended up in the ER after Mein Bowl one time. My only advice here is to be extra careful and check the doneness of EVERYTHING. Most of all, if something looks sus or tastes sus in the slightest, throw it away. Don't go to the commons right before they close because all the food will be old and probably rushed (which means undercooked). Check the expiration date on anything you buy from the C-store.

**Special Section: The Commons**  
I wanted to make this section because it is actually possible to go to the commons and have ""good"" food. But as usual, it will be difficult. The biggest thing is try to shift as much of the cooking process to yourself as possible. Season your own stuff cause they don't know how to. I enjoy the self-serve pasta section (it has cheese, roasted garlic & peppers, and pepper flakes) and the rice station (literally just two crock pots full of brown and white rice with condiments). Check the Everyday app before you go and plan out what you will get. Sometimes there is decent food being served. For instance, I had this one night:  
Oven-roasted turkey (a pretty safe protein), pasta with parmesan and roasted peppers, tofu stir-fry (that was  meh tbh), Asian wrap (or at least what the commons thought was Asian) and wild rice.  
The commons can actually be a decent breakfast option too. There's cereal (but not always milk), oatmeal, fruit, coffee and juice, yogurt, but that's all I would touch honestly.

I hope this guide can be helpful to someone (maybe even get a mod pin?). There's definitely something I'm forgetting, so I might update it later. I intentionally left out a section on off-campus food, the r/Birmingham subreddit has plenty of resources on that.",9,1737848487.0,UAB,1,1.0,False

One night, we saw a bunch of people in the bushes outside the hotel trying to help catch a kitten. No one was successful, but I bought food and left it out. I let the hotel know, but nothing came of it. 

The next night, the poor guy was screaming again. I bought more food, and spent an hour standing frozen over the food until I could snag this little one. 

The original plan was to get him to a shelter. I got him checked out by a vet, and was warned that no one would take him. Shelters were full, and since he was a black cat it would be even harder. When we went to PetSmart we saw every single cat there was a void looking for a home. My husband said he was ours now. 

We originally named him after the hotel, but as you can see with his half a tail, he is clearly a Bobcat. We spent the next two weeks in Hawaii doing tourist things, and since we couldn’t leave him in the hotel, Bob joined us. We climbed a mountain with this cat. He was our ringbearer. He went to a luau. 

I panicked trying to figure out how we would get him home. Spent thousands changing our flight (our airport didn’t allow animals to fly in, so we had to go somewhere else) and paying fees to take an animal on board. 

It was a crazy experience. It was worth the stress and every penny. I love my Bob. ",37,1737848365.0,blackcats,1,0.98,False

Here's a few of mine, but I would love to hear your tips and tricks for saving. 

\- Meal prep...   
GrubHub is so expensive!! Delivery really adds up.  
I like to make a casserole, chili, soup, etc. foods that are easy to portion into meal size containers and freeze. This way, if you've had a long day you can easily unthaw and have a good meal.  
I also pre-cut veggies, cheese, and fruits and package into snack bags. That way you don't have to think, just grab a healthy snack. Buying in bulk protein bars or other snacks really cuts cost as well.  
And make your coffee at home, this will save you hundreds at the end of the month. $5 on coffee a day, that's $150 a month just for coffee. 

\- Salon services...  
 nails and hair in a salon is ridiculously expensive anymore. So learn to do your own. I paint my nails on cam all the time, it's a good filler activity for when it's slow and I always get foot fetish guys who love to watch. It's a win/win. Showering, lotion, oils, etc. is also a great content filler for fan sites. Two birds with one stone, you make content AND you've done some self-care. 

\- Budget your cam girl accessories.   
This one is hard because we all want to put on a good show. But we still need to remember, what are you making vs. what are you spending? Sure, a new Lovense or webcam would really help... but can you afford it right now? Be smart before you spend, watch for sales, and plan ahead your budget. Is new lingerie a want or need? Did you make enough to justify a splurge? This job is not stable, so count your savings before you decide to buy new accessories. 

Hope this helps some... and again, I'd love to hear your frugal tips and tricks. xx ",18,1737848360.0,CamGirlProblems,3,1.0,False

I quit coffee 3 weeks ago. I used to drink 2-3 cups per day. My main motivation was it really messed with my hiatal hernia.

What I've come across are a couple of things. First of all, I can't handle boredom. I'm at a point in my life where I feel I have to squeeze every second of the day to be productive as I am striving to be more financially stable. I'm currently getting into programming to change jobs. Whereas in the past I would down a coffee then be super interested in programming or learning, today I just couldn't do it. And I felt like a kid being bored. Before any boredom would be masked with a dopamine burst and false inspiration from coffee. 

Second, and related, everything seems less interesting. I'm not super hyped about anything. I'm just there crusing. A benefit to this is I don't really care/feel anxiety any more. 

Today, I did do some longboarding which I haven't done in a couple of years. Felt great. I also staryed playing piano again after a long hiatus.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

I got really good rest last night. I woke up, made my kids bfast, and went to get my nails done. Then I got back, picked up my oldest, and took him to karate. At this point it’s 10:45am and I haven’t eaten anything. I stop for a coffee (just 3 shots of espresso with some oat milk) and sip on that. I then dropped my son back off at home and went to a wax appointment. I felt fine throughout all this time. To sum it up, I ended up eating my first meal of the day at around 1pm. For some reason after eating I felt really full and kinda bloated. I think I got in my head and began to tell myself I’m nauseous, to the point where I gave in and took a zofran. Honestly though, I think I just felt heavy from not having anything all morning (only espresso) to suddenly eating 3 eggs and a donut. Also, I hadn’t had much water all morning. 
After the zofran I feel totally fine. But I was convinced this was it and was going to be sick. Isn’t it a wonderful time when our mind plays games like that with us? ",3,1737847672.0,emetophobia,1,0.81,False

We ran medical supplies, food rations, artillery shells, and troops all up and down the Korean peninsula. Eventually, we went as far as Indochina to assist a group of Marines who weren’t too thrilled to see us. Their leader, a cocky colonel, commanded respect from his men.

""Heard you were surrounded,"" Mac said.

""That’s right,"" the Marine colonel replied with a huff, ""but the good thing about being surrounded is that it’s not a retreat—we were just attacking southward to get more supplies and keep kicking ass. It’s only eight divisions.""

After the conflict ended, I was promoted to Colonel, on the condition I stayed for another six months to ensure our equipment was loaded onto ships and sent elsewhere. When all was said and done, Jean-Michel and I decided we had risked our lives enough and seen enough combat. I’m sure the bullet that grazed his left cheek helped solidify that decision. So, we came back home and began building a life, developing ideas, and making investments. Slowly but surely, we transitioned from sharecropping sugar to savvy ventures that secured our financial future.

It was around this time that Knuckles met Rose, Jean-Michel’s sister. He later confessed to me that he’d never seen anyone as beautiful as her. ""Her skin looked like cocoa delicately brushed onto a marble masterpiece. Her eyes were deep chocolate, and her hair flowed mid-back. When she spoke, I felt my heart skip a beat—I swear I was among the choir of angels.""

At supper, the aroma of fresh steamed veggies, warm rolls, and roasted chicken filled the air. My mom glanced between my father and Knuckles, noting the gash on his cheek. ""Well, I see you two didn’t kill each other. But what happened to your cheek?""

Knuckles blushed slightly as Jean-Michel chuckled. My dad filled her in on the story, and by the time the chocolate cake came out, my grandpa asked Knuckles, ""So you said you’re a Marine? Tell me your tale, Marine.""

Knuckles took a deep breath and began: ""I finished Recon school in late ’64 and knew what was coming. I deployed with the 9th Marine Corps Expeditionary Brigade in March ’65. Really sucked, too—I had just bought a Panhead Electra Glide and had to leave it with my mom. We spent a lot of time in the bush, snooping and pooping, gathering intel on enemy positions so the redlegs could call in steel rain. By ’67, I was a machine gunner with 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, and that’s when the shit really hit the fan.""

He paused, collecting his thoughts. ""I was manning a key position at Nong Son outpost with four other Marines when the enemy launched a savage mortar and infantry assault. They killed my comrades and wounded me badly. Propping myself against my machine gun, I poured fire into their ranks, dropping VC left and right. I was the devil that day, and their bills came due. When I passed out, they must’ve thought I was dead. I woke up, started shooting again, and caused so much confusion they fired on each other.""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""They told me I broke up the enemy assault, delayed them long enough for reinforcements to organize a defense, and repelled a secondary attack. When I woke up in the hospital, they said I was a hero. But the real heroes are my buddies—lying in the ground, coming home in pine boxes.""

Knuckles sighed deeply. ""I got discharged after 18 months of rehab. Thought I’d get a letter of commendation, but the President awarded me the Congressional Medal of Honor.""

Grandpa snapped to attention, saluting. Knuckles chuckled. ""Thank you, Colonel, but I don’t need glory. Anyone in my position would’ve done the same—or better.""

After dinner, my mother asked Knuckles to be my godfather. With a teary smile, he accepted. ""I hope it’s not a girl,"" he joked. ""Her social life will be wrecked until she’s 40.""

Time passed. My mother’s belly swelled, and in May of 1970, I entered the world at nine pounds even. My life was one of hard work but also privilege. My family poured every ounce of knowledge into me. I attended Catholic school, where I excelled in divinity, catechism, reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and history. I seemed to grasp everything effortlessly, memorizing lectures and readings without notes. Bianca Reeds, a classmate, was always frustrated that no matter how hard she worked, she couldn’t keep up. Our healthy competition ended one day when she cornered me at recess, pulling my hair and punching me in the stomach.

Pain blossomed, but so did something else—an intense heat from deep within. Using the fighting skills Grandpa and Knuckles had taught me, I palm-struck her chest. She crumpled. Thinking I had only knocked the wind out of her, I walked away. Later, I learned she was taken to the hospital with a bruised sternum and a heart arrhythmia. She never looked or spoke to me again.

My dinner companion grunted impatiently. ""Are you going to get to the point?""

I glared, baring my fangs. ""I could pull over and drink you now, but it’s a long drive. Behave.""

As ""Carry On Wayward Son"" played in the background, he nodded, relenting.

It was May 1983, my 13th birthday. We had a pool party, and all my family attended along with about 20 kids from school—though I think their parents just wanted to check out Granddad's estate. Granddad used his engineering knowledge to link several Slip'N Slides together, adding a huge ramp at the bottom that launched us five feet into the air and at least 20 feet into the pool. It was amazing. Someone gifted me a prototype toy: a pink, battery-powered Barbie jeep. Later, Jean-Michel, Knuckles, and I upgraded it to reach 45 mph.

The snow cone stand, popcorn machine, and cotton candy were all a hit with us kids, while the adults gathered around the grill, full liquor bar, and lawn darts. Knuckles, as always, took his role as my godfather seriously, keeping a watchful eye on us like a sheepdog. After lunch, commotion erupted among the adults. I later learned that someone insulted Knuckles, accusing him of being a child predator. Jean-Michel tried to correct them, but the man turned to him and spat, “Up yours, n—.” Jean-Michel leveled him with one punch. The man, grumbling about lawsuits, slinked to the bar where the bartender handed him a highball and a towel of ice.

Granddad intervened, saying, ""Insulting my brother or any guest is akin to insulting me. File your suit if you wish, but you'll be outed as a hateful racist."" The man stayed quiet after that.

Later, we gathered around a three-tiered cake—strawberries and cream with vanilla icing, I think—and I opened presents. Granddad, as usual, went above and beyond, gifting me a young Appaloosa stallion. It was clear why he saved it for last. As the sun set, we gathered around the fire pit making s’mores and telling stories. When it got dark, Knuckles used his concert setup connections to arrange a massive fireworks display. It was the best—and maybe the worst—day of my life.

Exhausted, I thanked my guests and saw them off. My mother had me sit at the table with a stack of thank-you cards. ""MOM!"" I protested. ""Do I have to do this now?"" She explained it was better to do now than risk forgetting later. After finishing the last card, I staggered into my room, changed into my Care Bears nightgown and undies, and fell into bed.

That night, my life changed forever. I don’t remember falling asleep, but I vividly recall dreaming of being a predator, chasing animals through the woods. The thrill of their fear consumed me. Suddenly, I dreamed I was falling—and woke with a crash. Apparently, it wasn’t a dream.

When I opened my eyes, my entire world was unrecognizable. I don’t mean my room or stuffed animals were gone—I mean *I* was different. I went to sleep as a petite 4-foot-5 girl with shoulder-length chestnut brown hair and chocolate brown eyes. Now, I stood at 5-foot-9, with light brown hair streaked with caramel highlights, styled in a mix between a pixie and bob. My eyes had turned emerald green. My nightgown had become a midriff shirt, thanks to the curves and very perky D-cup I now sported. My body was tan, taut, and undeniably that of a grown woman, but inside, I was still my 13-year-old self.

Staring into the mirror, a flood of emotions overwhelmed me, and I screamed in horror. My mother burst into the room wielding a baseball bat. ""WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, LADY?! WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?!"" she shouted, shattering a lamp with her swing.

""Mommy, it’s me!"" I exclaimed, teary-eyed. ""WHERE’S MY DAUGHTER?!"" she cried, her voice more a whimper than a scream. After more back-and-forth shouting, she finally saw my birthmark shaped like Cape Cod on my hip. We sat down, shaken, and talked for hours. She confessed that a strange encounter at Woodstock might explain this. She had assumed the drugs made the man she met appear different, but now she realized he truly was.

""Mom, what are we going to tell Granddad and everyone?"" I asked. Together, we devised a plan. We would fake a runaway note, saying I couldn’t handle the pressure of our family’s expectations. Meanwhile, I would assume a new identity: Alexus ""Lexi,"" an orphan friend my mom met at university.

Mom called Knuckles, who brought over clothes and supplies. When he first saw me, he asked, ""Who's the chick?"" Mom explained the situation, and he shrugged, grinning. ""Well, there are worse things to wake up to,"" he joked. Mom slapped his shoulder, saying, ""This is serious! Aren’t you weirded out?"" Knuckles replied, ""I’ve seen my share of strange things—from Nam to the open road.""

The next day, Mom took me shopping. I was still learning how to walk with my new hips and chest, noticing the attention I got from men and the scowls from women. ""Mom,"" I whispered, ""why are these men staring at me like they’ve never seen a human before?"" She chuckled, ""Honey, God gave men enough blood for their brain or their... well, you know. And they’re rude when it’s the latter. Plus, you’re stunning by any standard. They can’t help it.""

After a few hours and a small fortune on Mom’s AmEx Gold Card, we had lunch. Oddly, the pizza tasted spicy to me, though Mom said hers wasn’t. ""That’s weird,"" I thought but shrugged it off.

Our next stop was the lab. Mom, a genetic researcher, had a contact who might help us figure this out. It was the height of the satanic panic, so people were oddly more open to discussing paranormal events and unexplained phenomena. I had no idea what awaited me, but I knew one thing for sure—my life would never be the same again.

Laboratories are often imagined as places filled with cutting-edge equipment and scientists conducting fascinating experiments. However, my experience was quite different. The lab I entered was a cold, sterile environment populated by individuals so intellectual they struggled to understand humor or sarcasm.

We were greeted by an impeccably dressed man. My mom embraced him, and they exchanged pleasantries in Italian. When they finished, he turned to me, taking my hand with a polite nod. “Good afternoon, I am Dr. Kreponzi,” he said in a thick Italian accent. Unlike others I’d met that day, he maintained respectful eye contact. He stood tall, about six feet, with raven-black hair, steel-gray eyes, and a perfectly tailored suit.

He guided me around the lab, introducing me to other doctors and scientists before leading me to an examination room. There, he and my mother began running tests: drawing blood, checking my reflexes, and performing other diagnostics. Throughout it all, Dr. Kreponzi treated me not as a test subject but as a scared young girl—which I admittedly was.

That night, my mom informed me we would be staying so they could monitor my brain activity during sleep. “Oh great,” I said sarcastically. “I get to sleep on a medical table in this sterile room. How wonderful.” Both she and Dr. Kreponzi chuckled.

“No,” he replied, smiling. “There is a proper sleep lab with a dark room and a very comfortable bed.”

When I lay down, it was as though I’d been embraced by an angel. Unfortunately, the wires and electrodes they attached to me diminished the comfort somewhat. Despite this, I drifted off, only to wake up ravenously hungry. Dr. Kreponzi prepared a beautiful breakfast: a mozzarella omelet with fresh fruit and seasoned potatoes. Yet, to my dismay, everything tasted like ash—even the juice. I could barely eat.

Examining my bloodwork, Dr. Kreponzi mused, “I have an idea based on your cellular structure. I’ll be right back.” He returned twenty minutes later with a beaker of thick, dark red liquid. Pouring it into a cup, he handed it to me. “Try drinking this.”

I hesitated. “Juice already tasted terrible,” I reminded him.

“This is different,” he assured me. Something in his voice made it hard to refuse. The liquid smelled bitter, and its taste was worse, but my body craved it. Before I knew it, I had drained the entire cup. Almost instantly, I felt better.

“What was that?” I asked. “It tasted awful, like raw kale.”

Both my mother and Dr. Kreponzi were staring at me. “What?” I asked nervously. “Do I have another eye or something?”

“No,” my mother said, her voice trembling. “You were speaking Italian. Perfectly.”

“What?” I was shocked.

Dr. Kreponzi’s steel-gray eyes gleamed with curiosity. “Fascinating,” he murmured. “It appears you’ve absorbed not just nourishment but knowledge.”

“What did you give me?” I asked, horrified.

“About two pints of my blood,” he said matter-of-factly.

My mother and I both exclaimed, “Blood?!”

“Yes,” he said calmly. “Based on your test results, I hypothesized your body might process blood differently. It appears I was correct.”

The next few days were filled with tests. My intelligence and reflexes had increased dramatically. Dr. Kreponzi speculated that consuming blood allowed me to gain the memories and knowledge of the donor. My abilities extended beyond intellect; I could sense minute changes in the environment, like the twitch of a muscle before someone moved.

One night, pain radiated through my jaw. It grew unbearable, even as they tried various painkillers. Tossing and turning, I awoke to find a lab assistant standing outside my door, behaving oddly. Before I realized what I was doing, I had lunged at him. My teeth sank into his neck, and I began drinking his blood. I drained him completely before I came to my senses, horrified.

The next morning, I confessed everything. Dr. Kreponzi listened intently, noting the strange connection between consuming blood and absorbing memories. I recounted the assistant’s life in vivid detail—his troubled childhood, his crimes, and his darkest secrets. The memories were overwhelming, as though I had lived his entire life in a single night.

“Why don’t you gain memories from other blood donors?” Dr. Kreponzi asked.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Maybe it’s tied to certain genetic markers or specific emotions.”

Over the following days, we uncovered more about my transformation. My heightened senses, reflexes, and strength became undeniable. Yet, the most striking discovery was my ability to extend or retract my canines at will. My mother was both amazed and frightened, constantly seeking reassurance from Dr. Kreponzi.

One evening, an inexplicable wave of fear and sadness overtook me. Memories of betrayal, abuse, and violence flooded my mind. They weren’t mine but fragments of the assistant’s past. I relived his pain, his crimes, and his eventual descent into depravity. It took hours to separate myself from his memories, leaving me emotionally and physically drained.

Dr. Kreponzi, ever analytical, began piecing together a theory. “Your abilities might stem from dormant genetic material activated by environmental factors. This could explain the myths and legends surrounding vampires.”

“Can we reverse it?” my mother asked desperately.

“I don’t think so,” he admitted. “This transformation appears to be deeply rooted in her DNA. Attempting to alter it could be dangerous.”

Despite the uncertainty, Dr. Kreponzi remained determined to understand my condition. He became both mentor and ally, guiding me through the complexities of my new reality. Each day brought new challenges and revelations, but with his help, I began to navigate the strange, dangerous path my life had become.

The next day, I met a young Black man who introduced himself as Ben. He shared his journey from poverty to becoming both a neuroscientist and a neurosurgeon. I was fascinated by his story, and he, naturally, was curious about mine—though skepticism was written all over his face. Dr. Kreponzi stepped in, issuing him a challenge: donate a liter of blood and test me on all his knowledge.

Ben was visibly hesitant, understandably so, but he eventually agreed. The taste of his blood? Awful—far more bitter than Dr. Kreponzi’s, which already reminded me of kale mixed with 80% dark chocolate. I wondered if being a good person made blood taste worse.

Once Ben had recovered, he began quizzing me on neuroscience topics—the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, and the brain’s anatomy. My favorite term to pronounce was ""corpus callosum,"" simply because it sounded fun. But the real test came when he asked what the last book he’d read was. Smiling, I told him not only the last book he read but also the one he was currently reading and the one he glanced at in the store that morning while buying coffee and an apple fritter.

He was floored. Still, he looked to Dr. Kreponzi and asked, ""What kind of trickery is this?""

Dr. Kreponzi replied, “No trick. Just a genetic anomaly.”

I explained my condition to Ben—the blood, the scents, the overwhelming knowledge—and asked him a question that had been nagging me: ""Why does one liter give me memories of learned knowledge, but more blood gives me their life experiences, emotions, and memories?""

Ben listened thoughtfully. ""It must be how the blood interacts with your brain,"" he said. He grabbed an anatomy textbook, flipping to the brain's memory-related sections. Pointing at the hippocampus, he hypothesized, ""Maybe one liter affects this part of the brain, which handles learned knowledge, while more blood accesses the amygdala and deeper areas tied to emotional memories and life experiences. The quantity you consume might determine how deep it goes.""

As outlandish as it sounded, he wasn’t wrong—we weren’t playing by conventional rules. He shared a few more theories before shaking hands with Dr. Kreponzi and leaving, promising to be available for future questions.

That evening, exhaustion caught up with us. After a hot shower and dinner, I fell into a deep sleep.

The smell of bacon, eggs, and potatoes woke me the next morning. It was incredible—WAIT. I COULD SMELL IT! I jumped out of bed as my stomach growled like I hadn’t eaten in a month. I dressed quickly and dashed into the kitchen, where Mom and the Doc were having breakfast.

“Are you okay?” Mom laughed.

“I’m just starving, and it smells amazing!”

They stared at me in disbelief. Dr. Kreponzi made me a mozzarella and spinach omelet, paired with maple bacon and fire-roasted potatoes sautéed with butter, onions, and green peppers. I devoured it, savoring every bite.

Later, I asked Dr. Kreponzi, “Do you have contacts at a church here?”

He raised an eyebrow. “You don’t know already?”

I grinned. “I do, but I’m trying to adapt to normal life. You know, polite conversation.”

He chuckled. “Fair enough. Yes, I know someone. Why?”

“It’s Sunday,” I said. “After everything that’s happened, I need to confess and pray for absolution.”

He paused, then said, “The cross or silver might harm you, but this could be a worthwhile experiment.”

A few hours later, it wasn’t just a priest who arrived—it was a bishop. I blushed, curtsying awkwardly as he greeted me. We sat in a quiet room, and I poured out my heart. I confessed my sins, including killing the lab tech, even if he was a terrible person. I described my condition—the blood, the scents, and my fear.

“How does my soul smell?” he asked after a moment, surprising me.

I chuckled despite myself. “Bitter, like turnip greens. That’s a good thing—it means your soul isn’t tainted.”

He leaned in. “What’s truly on your mind?”

I hesitated, then admitted, “I’m scared. Scared of this curse. If I kill people, what happens to my soul? Do I even have one to protect? Am I an abomination? Maybe Mom should have... should have gotten rid of me before I was born.” My voice cracked.

He studied me carefully before responding. “No, child. You are not an abomination. You are God’s creation, and your existence is part of His plan. The fact that you care about your soul proves you have one. Your instincts guide you to those who do evil—it is not malice, but divine purpose. In Ephesians 6, we are told to fight not only physical but spiritual forces of evil. You have been given a gift. Use it to bring closure to others, to protect the innocent, and to battle darkness.”

He finished by encouraging me to pray and assigned me penance—five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys.

I couldn’t help reflecting on his words. They were profound—far heavier than what I felt ready to handle. Normal girls my age were worrying about school crushes and fashion, not grappling with morality and divine purpose. Still, my life was changed forever, and it was time to embrace it.

My thoughts returned to the present as my dinner broke his silence. “Wow, you’ve had quite the life,” he said, glancing nervously at the driveway we were pulling into. His voice wavered as he started the usual apologies, bargaining, and confessions. I didn’t need to remind him of his crimes. He knew. He knew what he’d done and intended to do to the bartender—and what he’d intended to do—before I lured him to me.

Moments later, we arrived at one of my preferred places to have dinner. I drank him fully, and the torrent of horrors in his head was far worse than his confessions—a gruesome, unfiltered NC-17 reel of atrocities. Names, locations, the young girls he'd defiled both alive and deceased. Necrophilia. It churned my stomach, but I kept my composure.

I slid a folder across the table toward Agent Lydecker. ""Everything’s in here—names, details, where to find evidence and even his head. It’s all yours.""

Lydecker stared at me, his face a canvas for the internal storm he was weathering. Disbelief, revulsion, curiosity—all playing out like subtitles for me to read. Finally, he said, ""So, let me get this straight. You’re a serial killer suffering from some sort of mental illness, convinced you’re a vampire on a mission from God?"" His tone was sharp, almost mocking. ""I could arrest you right now, claim my gold star for bagging a prolific killer.""

I raised an eyebrow and offered a sly smile. ""Do you honestly think I’d let you?""

He leaned back, arms crossed. ""Then why? Why confess to me? Why admit to multiple capital offenses? Each one could get you the needle. And these supposed 'powers'—why not just show me?""

His condescension was palpable, but I decided to indulge him. Leaning in close, I released a small dose of pheromones and whispered, ""Why don’t you just pee your pants?""

I sipped my tea as Lydecker suddenly shot up, face flushed with panic. ""What the hell did you just do?"" he demanded.

Chuckling, I replied, ""They’re your pants, Agent. I’m not wearing them. All I did was give you a little push. You did the rest.""

He sat back down, visibly shaken. ""Okay,"" he muttered, ""maybe there’s more to this than I thought. But it’s been over 30 years since your first... and three days since your last."" His voice trailed off.

""Exactly,"" I said, keeping my tone even. ""I’m offering you more than a gold star. I’m offering families closure. They’ll believe you more easily than me. Here’s my proposition: I’ll give you all the files—every kill I’ve ever made. You can solve cases spanning decades, cases your bosses never even knew existed. Do you really think there’ve only been 30-ish trucker serial killers? Or that people like Dahmer were exceptions? Your bosses have no idea what’s been happening in this country, not now, not ever.""

Lydecker was reading through the file when I leaned in and kissed him lightly on the cheek, leaving a perfect lipstick mark. Then, I slipped away.

About 15 minutes later, a waitress dropping plates jolted him out of his daze. She leaned in, concerned. ""Are you okay, hon?""

Lydecker looked bewildered. ""Where’d she go?""

The waitress frowned. ""You’ve been sitting here alone this whole time, hon.""

""No!"" he exclaimed, clutching the file. ""There was a woman—she gave me this!""

I’d made sure to hit him with a strong dose of pheromones, enough for him to remember the encounter but not my appearance. He wouldn’t be able to find me, even if he tried.

Later, as I sat with Bishop Carter, I asked, ""Do you think I’m making the right choice, trusting him to help?""

The bishop placed a reassuring hand on mine. ""It’s all in God’s hands, child. Pray on it. See what He has in store for you. Keep praying, and I’ll take your confession after your next cycle. You are still attending regular confessions, right?""

I nodded. ""Yes, and I’m only going after those God puts in my path.""

""Good,"" he said. ""Stay on God’s path, and you will surely be granted eternal rest in heaven, child.""

 

**Epilogue: A Hero’s Legacy**

Knuckles’ story of resilience, sacrifice, and unyielding courage was not merely an imaginative tribute to valor—it was deeply inspired by the true heroism of Private **First-Class Melvin Earl Newlin**.

On July 3rd and 4th, 1967, Pfc. Newlin demonstrated unmatched bravery as he served as a machine gunner attached to the 1st Platoon, Company F, 2d Battalion. Amidst the chaos of a savage mortar and infantry assault at the Nong Son outpost, he held fast at his post even as his four comrades fell around him and he was severely wounded.

Propping himself against his machine gun, Pfc. Newlin poured relentless fire into the attacking Viet Cong forces, repelling multiple waves of the enemy. Despite being repeatedly hit by small-arms fire and knocked unconscious by a grenade, his indomitable spirit refused to yield. Regaining consciousness, he crawled back to his weapon and unleashed a devastating counterattack on the enemy’s rear, creating confusion and halting their advance.

When he spotted the Viet Cong attempting to turn a captured weapon on his fellow Marines, Pfc. Newlin shifted his fire to inflict heavy casualties and thwart their efforts. Over the course of the battle, he repelled wave after wave of enemy attacks until he was mortally wounded, his final stand giving his comrades the time they needed to rally and secure their defenses.

His actions shattered the enemy’s momentum and demonstrated extraordinary gallantry, fortitude, and devotion to duty, even in the face of almost certain death. Pfc. Newlin’s heroic sacrifice earned him the Medal of Honor, the highest recognition of valor in the U.S. Armed Forces.

Knuckles’ character was a tribute to warriors like Pfc. Newlin—those who embody the highest traditions of courage and sacrifice. Through his story, we honor the legacy of those who stand against the darkness, often paying the ultimate price so others might live in safety and freedom.

Let the memory of **Private First-Class Melvin Earl Newlin** forever remind us of the profound depths of human resilience and the unwavering spirit of the Marine Corps. His courage was not fiction, but the extraordinary truth of what it means to be a hero.",2,1737846937.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

1i9zteo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9zteo/the_guilt_i_bore_festered_into_my_soul/,The Guilt I Bore Festered into My Soul,"It was 17 years ago. I was ten years old when my parents took me and my best friend Erik on a hike, up into the mountains. Me and my parents had walked the route before, but I was still excited since Erik could come along. The route was about 7 miles long, which is a bit far for two ten year old boys to walk, but at the end of the route there was this cabin that sold cakes and waffles, which was enough motivation for me and Erik to get through the entire hike without complaint. 

The Hike started off with this long path that was relatively straight forward. The sun was out and it was warm enough for me to go without a jacket, Erik did the same. 

About halfway through the hike my parents decided to settle down and take a break. Me and Erik were too pumped up with excitement to take a break so we asked if we could go and play in the forest. My parents were reluctant since there was a cliff not too far away, but since we promised to not go near it, we got permission. 

After some rummaging around in the forest we eventually went too far and stumbled upon the cliff. It was very steep, so I was too frightened to go near it. I told Erik that we should be getting back to mom and dad, but he wasn’t as frightened as me. He tried to convince me that it wasn't as dangerous as my parents had told me.

“Come on, they won't know if we don’t tell them,” He said.

“It’s still dangerous,” I said.

“Only if we slip. Come on, I have something to show you.” He said, as he went over to pick up a rock and proceeded to throw it over the cliff. 

“Look, isn’t that fun? Let’s see who can throw it the farthest,” He said. 

I was still reluctant, but seeing that he managed to stand pretty firmly on the ground while throwing multiple rocks, I eventually got more confident. I then got an idea.

I, without telling him, snuck up to the biggest rock I could find, that also could fit in my hand and picked it up. I had planned to surprise him with the longest shot I could muster. I got myself into position, hurled back my hand and then flung the stone with all my strength.

It was instantly followed up by a thud and a blood curdling scream of agony. I had hit Erik directly in his head.

My entire body froze in panic, I could not believe what I had just done. Erik laid on the ground without saying a word, only moaning in pain. With a heart sunk in the pit of guilt I declared how sorry I was with the utmost sincerity, but it fell on deaf ears.

To my horror I realized the true state of the situation when I went over to him and saw his blood red eye and sunken skull. His breath was frantic, filled with panic, pain and confusion.

I just stood over him, not knowing what to do. 

Frankly there was nothing I could do. His breathing slowly stopped and then he was dead silent.

I fell back, too terrified to look at the scene. I turned my head and jumped in fright when I saw the glaring eyes of apprehensiveness coming from my father, who had just come to find us in this state. 

“I didn’t mean to!” I cried, curdling up into a ball. 

From then on I disassociated from the situation, overwhelmed from all my emotions. I only snapped back to reality when I saw my father, holding Erik in his arms, threw his body over the cliff. He looked back at me with a gaze that froze me to stone. Slowly walking up to me, crouching down and grabbing my arms with a force he has never dared to use on me before. 

“You can *never* tell anyone about this! Do you hear me?!”. He shook me, trying to sober me up from the situation. 

“He fell, that is what happened. He *fell*!”

The police recovered Erik's body and concluded that he died from a head injury caused by the fall. My mother, filled with guilt and sorrow, had begged on hands and knees to Eriks parents for forgiveness. She did not receive it. She didn’t get forgiveness from herself either for the trauma this had caused me.

Both my parents became distant, my mother because of her guilt, and my father out of spite for what I had done. I remained mentally gone for seven months until my brain eventually figured out a way to bury the trauma.

In the present both my parents are dead. My father died of a heart attack four years ago and my mother drank herself to death before that.  

Up until now I have gotten used to living with what I have done. I sort of accepted that I couldn’t do anything but move on and forget. It remained a distant memory that came up less and less as time moved on. Until about a month ago, when I heard a knock on my door.

I lived alone in a remote house near the sea. Receiving unexpected visitors was not something I was used to. I opened the door and was greeted by a police officer. 

“Good afternoon, might you be Thomas Carter?” The officer asked.

“Ehh.. Yes.” I answered.

“I am officer Miller. I have come to ask some questions about an incident you witnessed when you were younger.” He stated.

“What incident?” I asked. 

“I am referring to an incident where you witnessed the death of Erik J. Adams.” The police officer clarified.

A jolt of anxiety hit me like a lightning strike. “Wh…why?” I said meekly.

“The police apartment has recently gotten into a scandal surrounding poor management of cases. Claims of insufficient investigating and unprofessional behavior has led us to reopen investigations that were concluded despite certain discrepancies in the evidence.” The police officer stated. 

“Discrepancies?” I asked. I had no idea what the so-called discrepancies could be.

“Yes, I was going to ask you to clarify some of them. Might I come in?” He asked.

I let the officer into my house and asked him if he would like some coffee, at which he refused. He went over to my dining room table and told me to sit down. I followed his command and he sat down on the other side of the table. 

“I read your testimony from 17 years ago, it was brief,” he stated.

“Ehh… yes, at the time I hadn’t yet fully recovered from the situation, mentally.” I said.

“Yes, the report said that you weren't in a stable enough mind to give a proper answer to any of the questions. The only clear thing you stated was that he fell,” he said.

“Yes, he did… he fell.” 

The officer looked me directly into my eyes, waiting for a moment before stating. “When asked how he fell, you didn’t answer. You just repeated the same phrase, he *fell*.”

“Well as I said I wasn’t entirely there, in the head” I said. 

“But now you are… here, in the head?” He asked, without breaking eye contact. 

I nodded. 

“How did he fall Thomas”

I was not prepared to answer the question, to lie on the spot has never been a strong suit of mine.

“Well, eh… he slipped,” I said regretfully.

“He slipped? on what exactly?” He asked. 

“On the… the ground” I answered.

“Why did he slip on the ground?” He asked.

My mind was rushing for any explanation I could come up with, but my anxiety kept me from rationalizing my thoughts. Relying on my intuition to come up with an excuse, I stated, “Well I think his shoelaces were untied, so ehm… that's how he fell.”

“Ok… How did his united shoelaces lead to him slipping?” He asked.

“Well, ehh… What I meant to say is that he tripped,” I answered.

“Ok. So he tripped on his shoelaces, is what you're saying?” He asked.

“Yes,” I confirmed.

He squinted his eyes while looking into mine and asked, “Are you certain?”

“I am pretty sure,” I answered.

The officer continued to look into my eyes. 

Silence.

“Why are you lying to me?” he asked.

I was dumbfounded by the questions. “I eh… what?”

“Last I checked the report it said that Erik was wearing a pair of Nike shoes that use velcro, not laces.” He said.

Yet again I found myself completely dumbfounded, why would he memorize something like that? 

“Are you sure?” I asked.

“Positive,” he confirmed.

“You know, I eh… I just don’t really remember what happened, it's all just a blur.” I said, trying to recover from my mistake. 

“You’re telling me that you forgot how your friend died right in front of your eyes?” He asked unconvinced.

“Well, it was 17 years ago,” I answered.

“So you remember exactly when, but nothing about how?” He asked.

“Yes, I don’t remember how,” I answered more sternly, trying to sound assertive.

We both sat in silence, looking at each other. 

“That's a pity,” he said. After raising himself from his chair he began to walk out the door. On his way out he said, “It would have been easier to find out what happened if you could give an actual testimony…” He looked back at me, “... don’t worry though, we have enough evidence to puzzle together what really happened.”

His look made me uncomfortable. I didn’t look back, I just wanted him gone. Once the door closed behind him I could finally breathe a sigh of relief and collect my thoughts, but then it hit me.

I sprinted out the door and on to the porch as he was about to get into his car. 

“Hey wait!” I yelled. He looked up and back at me. “What did you mean by discrepancies?” I asked. He studied my face for a second and then smiled with satisfaction.

“I will see you son Thomas,” He said.

He sat down in his car, and drove away.

I walked back into my home and closed the door behind me. My entire body felt like it was tied to the ground, my heart beating a million times per second. I let go of my strength and collapsed onto the floor bawling my eyes out, overwhelmed by anxiety. 

My mind raised, trying to figure out what the so-called “discrepancies” were. Could it be that he wasn’t thrown the right way? That the autopsy actually pointed towards him not getting the deadly strike from the fall? Or was it the testimony of me and my father that didn’t correlate? After some time of thinking, it finally came to me.

The rock! Did my father leave the rock at the scene? No, he couldn’t have. He would have known it was dangerous to just leave it there. I went deep into my mind to try to remember what my father did that day, but all I could think about was Eriks lifeless body with an abhorrent dent in his head.

I had buried that day so deep into my mind I could not remember any details. The guilt crept its fingers around my heart and I layed there, on the floor, showing no signs of strength or integrity, submitting my entire soul to the ruthless torture of my consciouns.

After laying there for an hour, I eventually exhausted my emotions. I felt hollow, lifeless. Standing up I thought of nothing else to do than to go to sleep, to reset my brain so it could deal with whatever it had to deal with. 

I walked into my bedroom and just collapsed onto my bed, without taking off my clothes. I closed my eyes and waited for the soothing embrace of unconsciousness. Then, suddenly. 

*\*Thud\**. 

My eyes jolted up and anticipation filled the room. I had clearly heard something, but silence was the only thing present. 

Assuming that it was nothing of importance I closed my eyes again. 

*\*Thud\**.

It came from the window. I opened my eyes again. My window was situated at the other side of the room. Laying down in my bed I could only see the sky through the window. Was there someone out there?

Still, silence. I was beginning to suspect that I was going mad. It wasn’t an unreasonable suspicion, considering the emotional shitstorm I just went through. 

*\*Thud\**. 

Now I saw it. I clearly saw a small rock hit the window. Terror froze me in my place. I didn’t know who was throwing the rocks. My gut sank to the floor when a voice came from outside the window.

“Thomas”. 

I hadn’t heard his voice in such a long time, but I instantly recognised it. It was the voice of Erik.

*\*Thud\**. 

Another rock had hit the window. I had had enough, this was clearly my mind just working tricks on me.

I worked up the courage to just get out of bed and show my mind that there was nothing out there. Raising myself up from my bed, putting my feet on the ground and standing up. I walked slowly over to my window.

The moonlight was shining through my window, illuminating everything outside it. The sea was to my right and there was grass covered rock before me. There was no one outside my window.

Breathing a sigh of relief, I concluded that my mind was just playing tricks on me. I turned around, ready to go back to bed, but I froze.  

On the wall in front of me I could see someone’s shadow. A small humanoid figure standing to my left, behind the window, behind me.

Tears began to roll down my face. I could not believe my eyes, I had just checked and there was no one outside.

“Come outside Thomas”

I did not want to go outside. I couldn’t call the police either, I had already made them suspicious enough. The only thing left for me to do was lay back into bed and pray I could fall asleep.

*\*Thud\**

*\*Thud\**

*\*Thud\**

It continued like that for the entire night. I couldn’t get a single hour of sleep. Day came and there were no more rocks hitting my window. 

Time went by and for an entire month I was pestered by stones hitting my window and whatever was out there trying to lure me out. 

Yesterday was the day I had had enough.

I decided that I would go out and confront whatever was out there. It was the only choice I had. Night came and I got ready.

Standing in front of my door I waited for a rock to hit my window.

*\*Thud\**

I braced myself for whatever was out there and opened the door to my house. Walking out I could feel the cool air drifting from the sea, filling me with the smell of salt. 

Walking towards the edge of my house where my bedroom window was, I yelled, “I am here now. What do you want?”

Silence. 

I tried again, “I am here, outside. What do you want from me?”

There was still nothing, only the soft wind and the waves on the sea. Standing right outside my window, I felt tired. I was tired of whatever was haunting me, why can't I just move on? Why must I be condemned for a mistake I did 17 years ago? Was I not just a child? Am I liable for the mistakes I did at such an age?

Suddenly, I could hear the same blood curdling scream I had heard 17 years ago from behind me. My body collapsed from the sudden fright and all the buried emotions from the past were released into my soul. 

Laying on the ground I turned around and saw him. He was standing in front of me. His head was still dented and his eye was still bloody.

“It was so painful,” Erik said.

Speechless. Tears rolling down my eyes.

“Why did you kill me Thomas?” Erik asked.

“I don’t know. I didn’t mean to,” I answered.

“Why did you murder me? Why did you murder me?!” He yelled. 

I tried to stand up but I remained frozen. Erik was walking slowly towards me, for each step he took his head grew bigger, and his legs and arms did the same. He started to tower over me with long lanky legs and arms, his head twice as big as mine.

He grabbed me by the chest and imprinted his fingers, now more like claws, onto my chest. His Blood red eye began to bulge out of its socket. 

Then, his eye popped out and fell onto my lap. It was the size of a tennis ball. His empty eye socket began to leak blood and brain mass all over me.

I tried to claw my way out of his grasp but he was too strong. He opened his mouth so wide that the skin around his jaw ripped apart, and then he stuffed my feet into his mouth and I could slowly feel myself slide into his belly.

I screamed for help, but no one answered. 

Again trying to bring myself free, I managed to turn around on my stomach. Tilting my head up I could see the sea, and two other human forms standing in the distance. I then realised It was my parents. 

“Mom, dad, help me!” I yelled. My dad turned his head towards me and I could see the same look in his eyes that he had 17 years ago. He turned his head back, and they walked off into the ocean. 

Feeling completely hopeless, I let Erik consume me. Sliding deeper into his stomach the last thing I saw was a glint of moonlight before I completely succumbed to the darkness.

Day came and I woke up on the ground, outside my house. I was completely drenched in mucus and blood. Erik was gone. I walked back into my home and took a shower. 

In the shower I finally got the peace and clarity I needed to think through everything and realized what I had to do.

That is where I am now, writing this out has felt like a million pounds lifted off my shoulders. After publishing this I will go to the police station and tell them exactly what happened. I don’t know if I could be charged with manslaughter for something I did when I was ten, but whatever the consequences are I will accept them.

Grand Staircase-Escalante, early April, 6 days/5 nights looking for route recommendation

2 backpackers, one with off trail experience one without. Solid off trail navigating but none of that offtrail experience has been in the Southwest or other similarly dry or canyon environment. 
No canyoneering experience and will not have a rope.
One vehicle. Open to hiring a shuttle but prefer not to, so loop is ideal.
Would prefer a mix of on and off trail but understand there are few connected trails in the area. 
Coming from the North, so that will have an impact on how much driving we have to do.
Fit so we like hard days but we aren't into super high mileage. Like to enjoy breakfast coffee, a nice lunch and leisurely dinner at camp.
Somewhat stressed about water access given lack of experience in similar environments!

So- looking for recommendations and even better GPS tracks.

I’m organizing a fundraiser through Relay for Life to honor my grandmother, who fought stage 4 lung cancer before passing away. She was the strongest woman I know and was also my best friend. Life will never be the same without her, but I hope I can make her proud by advocating for cancer awareness and raising money for cancer research. Alongside persevering through weekly treatment, hair loss, and invasive draining care, she remained strong by overcoming language barriers in the hospital and never lost her voice. The team name “Team Hamoney” honors our Korean heritage that she kept even after moving to the US. 

Every dollar fundraiser will go towards helping patients like my grandmother have access to treatment and continue cancer research. The price of a coffee or a pack of gum, however much is possible will still make an impact by supporting patients and spreading hope. I’m incredibly grateful for any support and I’m so thankful to have the opportunity to share her story through this. 

You can join my team, donate, or simply help spread the word. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a huge impact. Together, we can honor those we’ve lost, celebrate survivors, and give hope to those still fighting.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

My school is a big nerd school in which there is a very large ratio of more guys than girls.

My major is animation it's incredibly small, everybody is friends, and the best people (including me) are part of a large group of friends. all the women are either gay or asexual in my major.

I'm in clubs, I'm in an archery club (which hasn't met this semester so I might have a chance there). A yoga club (trying to go a few more times before I start talking to people) a radio club, and sometimes theatre.

It's not a big party school, and the only parties are run by the douchbag drunks and stoners, not my vibe.

A main joke of campus is the guys all look the same, and that's true, it's your typical greasy nerdy coding guy. I am not a greasy nerdy coder. I have fantastic hygiene, a good build, and solid looks.

I've had some dates since getting here (I'm first year in second semester) but none of them have lead anywhere. I want a committed relationship but can't seem to find one.

I've asked out a few girls in person, but mainly I've chatted with them on Instagram or other socials and eventually asked them out for coffee as a trial date. Nothing has lead beyond that.

I'm not a dead beat, as I have dreams and an actual personality. Not just being obsessed with anime and other stuff like most guys on this campus.

What are others ways to meet women. Join more clubs I assume, to which I ask, what clubs? There's a ballroom dancing club, a hiking club, a lot of random stuff honestly. What clubs worked best for you? Or can I approach them at a dining hall or coffee shop line? Study groups don't work because the only studying for my major is drawing, and there are zero to very little women available. Do I try other art majors, like photography?

1i9zfqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i9zfqo/crossroads_of_identity/,Crossroads of Identity,"Astrid’s father’s job moved them out of their hometown when middle school ended. It dumped them in the unfamiliar terrain of Colorado Springs. A foreign world replaced everything she had known and was comfortable with. It left her standing alone with no friends to lean on for support or comfort.

Her fingers grazed the cool metal of the lockers. She was weaving through the high school’s crowded corridors. The noise of slamming doors and boisterous laughter invaded her senses. She could feel stares lingering a second too long, burning into her like spotlights she didn’t ask for. The vibrant posters plastered against the walls—a riot of colors and upcoming events—blurred past her as she quickened her pace, seeking refuge.

Astrid had always been tall and slender, but her delicate features made her stand out. It wasn’t a problem growing up, but now, in high school, where fitting in was everything, she felt like she didn’t belong anywhere. She didn’t fit in with the popular crowd, and the misfits didn’t understand her either. Astrid longed to find a place where she could feel accepted and comfortable, but it seemed impossible amidst the social hierarchies of high school.

The theater room’s heavy door muffled the chaos behind her as it swung shut, enveloping Astrid in a hush that felt like the first deep breath after surfacing from underwater. Here, amidst the scent of sawdust and fabric, she shed the weight of their gazes. Bound by a shared silence, her fellow theater club members concentrated on their tasks. They nodded to her, smiles genuine but not prying, and she returned the gesture with relief.

“Hey, Astrid,” called out a voice from the stage. She glanced up to find Ben, the lighting wizard of the group, beckoning her over to help adjust a spotlight. Their easy friendship was a balm—here, she wasn’t an outsider; she was part of the crew, valued for her eye for detail and her knack for capturing the right angle.

As the afternoon wore on, Astrid laughed more freely, her voice blending into the symphony of creativity around her. But as the final bell rang out, signaling the end of another day, a shadow crept over her lightness. The hallways had emptied, the echo of footsteps a reminder of the solitude waiting outside these walls.

Astrid searched for love in high school, but it always evaded her. She tried dating Kevin, a sweet boy with a gentle nature, but there was no chemistry between them. Then there was Emily, the edgy and confident girl who made Astrid’s heart race while still leaving her feeling disconnected. Despite these fleeting relationships, Astrid’s heart remained unfulfilled, yearning for something or someone she couldn’t grasp.

These fleeting connections were puzzle pieces that refused to fit, leaving her to wonder if the picture was even hers to complete. She had liked everyone she had ever dated, and they all parted as friends, but she had never felt like she was the person she should have been. This was not just the case with her relationships. It was how she felt throughout her high school years.

At her locker, she paused, pushing the strands of dark red hair away from her face as she caught her reflection in the small mirror affixed inside. Those bright blue eyes gazed back, searching for recognition in a face that promised more questions than answers.

“See you tomorrow?” said her friend John, whose voice broke through her reverie as he leaned against the locker beside hers, hopeful.

“Sure,” she replied. “Tomorrow.”

With a soft click, she closed the door to her locker—and another day’s pretenses. As she stepped out of the building, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the campus. Each step away from school was a step back into a world that insisted on defining her before she could express herself.

Astrid pulled her leather jacket tighter around her as the fall air nipped at her skin. The jacket was a makeshift armor against more than just the cold. She walked home braced for the battles ahead, knowing that every day was a challenge and a chance to inch closer to the person she yearned to be.

Her bedroom door clicked shut, a soft degree of privacy in the otherwise exposed terrain of her life. She leaned back against it, soaking in the solitude. She had draped the walls with posters of some of her favorite video games and theater playbills from school plays.

She approached her dresser, a makeshift altar where countless stashed cosmetics lay in wait. She opened the drawer, moved aside the clothing, and let her fingers dance over the secret stash of palettes and brushes, each one a key to unlocking parts of herself hidden from the world. Tonight, she reached for a cobalt blue wig—its fibers a cascade of potential identities—and settled it onto her head, adjusting the bangs to frame her face.

Astrid exhaled, her reflection now an echo of her inner self. With delicate precision, she painted her features, the transformation not physical but personal. Each brushstroke was a conversation, each color choice a declaration. In these moments of metamorphosis, Astrid found clarity. Cosplay wasn’t a hobby; it was her canvas, and tonight, she was both an artist and a masterpiece. Each session like this one allowed Astrid to feel she was coming closer and closer to who she felt she should be.

The freedom was intoxicating. In this sanctuary of wigs and whimsy, Astrid allowed her heart’s desires to surface, unjudged by the harsh spotlight of societal expectations. For a fleeting instant, she posed, admired, and reveled in the embodiment of her truth.

Yet, amid the haven of self-expression, a persistent undercurrent of fear tainted the waters. Astrid’s gaze fell upon the small digital clock beside her bed, its red numbers counting down to tomorrow’s therapy session—a pilgrimage to the one place where her words could dress as her body did now. Her parents thought the sessions were for her depression, and in some ways they were, but Astrid and her therapist knew the genuine reasons.

In one of her early sessions during her freshman year, Astrid had sat on the edge of the therapist’s couch, her hands nervously twisting the fabric of her hoodie, avoiding eye contact with her therapist. She had already spent several months with Dr. Hawley dancing around the issue, unsure how to articulate the confusion and discomfort that had haunted her for years. The words seemed stuck in her throat, too heavy to say aloud. But as her therapist patiently waited, something clicked into place. “I just don’t feel… right.” This had not been the first time their conversations had circled back to this topic. Dr. Hawley had pressed her to expand on her ‘feeling’ many times before, but she could never articulate an answer. During this session, Astrid sat quietly for several moments and finally whispered, her voice trembling. “It’s like I’m living in the wrong body. Does that make sense? Like everyone sees someone that isn’t really me.” The realization had hit her with startling clarity, and tears welled up in her eyes as she spoke. “I think… I think I’m supposed to be a girl.” For the first time, the fog of confusion lifted, and though the road ahead was daunting, Astrid felt a strange sense of relief in finally naming the source of her pain.

During her Junior year in high school, Astrid had sat on the therapist’s couch with her legs crossed, a small smile playing on her lips as she recounted a recent experience. “I went out last weekend while my parents were at some event,” she said, her voice soft but steady. “As Astrid. Mind you, I don’t do this often. I wore this blue dress I found at a thrift store, and I spent over an hour getting my makeup just right.” Her smile widened as she continued. “When I first stepped out of my house, I was terrified. What if one of the neighbors saw me or what my parents came home early? But the moment I was out there walking down the sidewalk towards the bus stop, something changed. People smiled at me as I passed them, not in that weird, judgmental kind of way, but like they were happy to see me. I wasn’t hiding anymore, and it felt… It felt incredible.” She paused, searching for the right words. “It’s like every time I go out as myself, the real me, I get a little braver. I’m becoming more and more comfortable in my skin, like this is who I’m supposed to be.”

Therapy sessions were islands of solace in her tumultuous sea, yet they also marked the treacherous waters she navigated with each visit. The possibility that her parents might uncover her secret made each confession to the therapist a calculated risk. Amidst the support, there was always the cold touch of what if—the dread of exposure, the threat of rejection. Sometimes that happened while she was out at a store as Astrid. It happened often enough to keep her on her toes, and it would make her revisit what she had done wrong to make her not ‘pass’. But each setback helped her hone her skills at picking the right clothes, perfecting her makeup, or even just the way she walked so she looked like any other woman in public.

Vulnerability returned to Astrid as she removed her makeup, wiping away the everything that spoke her truth. She stashed away the wigs and dresses and tidied her room to leave no trace behind. She glanced around the room again at the safe harbor she’d created and promised herself that one day, the courage she found here would follow her into the world.

For now, she crawled into bed, surrounded by the echoes of who she could be, and closed her eyes. Sleep would come, bringing dreams of a life where the person in the mirror matched the person within, where authenticity wasn’t a costume worn behind closed doors. And tomorrow, she would face the world again—armed with the strength of her secrets and the fragile hope of what lay on the horizon.

But the weight of her journey stayed with her, even in dreams. Memories surfaced, carrying her back to moments that had shaped her—a different time, a different place. The familiar tension of high school crept in, those long hallways she had wandered for four years, searching for a sense of belonging that always seemed just out of reach. She had stood on the edge of herself, waiting for something—someone—to tell her who she was. At the end of a long hallway, she saw a confident young woman taking her first steps into the world.

With a shake of her head, Astrid stood alone in the empty corridor, her gaze lingering on the sea of lockers that had been the backdrop to her high school years. The last bell had rung, and the clamor of students had dissipated, leaving a welcome and disquieting silence. She drew in a deep breath, the air tasting of dust and disinfectant mixed with a hint of nostalgia.

High school was over.

She let out a breath slowly that stirred strands of hair that framed her face—hair that was hers by choice, not by nature. This ending was also a beginning; the weight of that truth settled in her bones. Astrid clutched her diploma tightly, the parchment a talisman for the journey ahead. Challenges were woven into the fabric of this paper, but it also contained hope—a newfound determination to live authentically.

She turned her back on the lockers and walked out into the sunlight. It was warm, comforting, and seemed like a promise. As Astrid moved towards her future, her steps grew firmer, no longer confined to the shadows of a stage or the quiet solitude of her bedroom. The world awaited, vast and daunting, but she was ready to meet it head-on.

Her parents had moved back to Denver, leaving her with some independence in Colorado Springs. The apartment they helped her find was small—a studio above a boutique—but it was hers alone. They had helped her pack her old clothes from home, but aside from a few sentimental pieces like her black leather jacket and messenger bag, Astrid stacked most of them by the door, ready to be donated. What they didn’t know was that she had been keeping her women’s clothing—clothes they wouldn’t have understood—hidden in a storage unit nearby. Earlier that day, she returned a rental van after moving those clothes into her apartment. Now, surrounded by her gaming consoles, board games, and the wardrobe that finally reflected who she was, Astrid felt the freedom she had longed for. Her wigs, clothes, and makeup were no longer hidden away; they were now a part of her life, a visible expression of her identity.

Each morning, as she experimented more with her appearance, Astrid watched herself become more and more aligned with the person she knew herself to be. In front of the mirror, she considered these moments sacred. There was no fear of prying eyes or judgment in this space—only the courage to embrace her identity.

“Welcome home,” she said to her reflection. The reflection smiled back, bright blue eyes shining with the light of acceptance. This sanctuary she had carved out for herself, a haven from the misunderstandings and expectations of the outside world.

**…**

Astrid stepped out of her apartment, the morning sun casting a warm glow on her face. She had developed a deep appreciation for these walks to the local thrift store. With each outing, the tight knot of anxiety in her chest loosened, giving way to a sense of empowerment. The

The bell above the thrift shop’s door chimed as she entered. The aisles, once intimidating labyrinths, now welcomed her like old friends. Astrid moved through them with a newfound grace, fingers grazing over fabrics and patterns that spoke to her evolving style. Today, a soft, floral dress caught her eye, and without hesitation, she headed to the fitting room.

“Looks great on you,” said the attendant, a kind smile gracing her lips. These small affirmations, once rare, had become threads in the fabric of Astrid’s daily life—stitching together a tapestry of acceptance.

Her confidence bloomed with each genuine interaction, leaving behind the days of rehearsed responses and feigned indifference. Shopping was no longer a chore shrouded in discomfort; it was an act of self-love, a declaration of her identity.

Later that morning, Astrid crossed the threshold into the bookstore café where she worked. The scent of coffee and old pages promised another kind of refuge. Frank, her manager, nodded from behind the counter. Michael, always quick with a joke, flashed her a grin from his spot by the bookshelves. And Michelle’s laughter echoed as she arranged the chalkboard menu.

“Morning, Astrid!” Michelle called out. “Your display idea for the fantasy section was a hit. We’ve sold more this week than last month!”

“Really?” Astrid’s eyes lit up, her heart swelling with a sense of accomplishment.

“Of course,” said Frank. He walked over with her favorite cup of coffee. “You have a knack for understanding what people want to read. It’s a gift.”

“Thanks, Frank.” Astrid accepted the coffee, savoring the warmth that spread through her fingers. Here, among stacks of stories and the hum of quiet conversations, she wasn’t an employee. She was part of a community—a family—that saw her not as someone fraught with complexities, but as a person worthy of respect and kindness. This was more than a job; it was a place where they recognized and valued her ideas and contributions.

The café buzzed with life around her, customers lost in their books or tapping away at laptop keys. Astrid took her place behind the register, ready to meet the day’s challenges head-on. Each smile, each “thank you” from a customer, reinforced her belief in herself and the path she had chosen.

The café buzzed with life around her, customers lost in their books or tapping away at laptop keys. Astrid took her place behind the register, ready to meet the day’s challenges head-on. Each smile, each “thank you” from a customer, reinforced her belief in herself and the path she had chosen.

A customer approached, holding a worn paperback copy of The Night Circus. Astrid’s eyes lit up.

“This is a great pick,” she said, ringing it up. “One of my favorites, actually.”

The woman smiled, intrigued. “Really? What did you like about it?”

“There’s this dreamlike quality to the whole thing,” Astrid said, her voice softening. “The way the circus itself almost feels like a character, and how it plays with time and reality. It’s... magical, but also kind of bittersweet.”

The woman nodded thoughtfully. “That sounds like exactly what I’m in the mood for.”

“You won’t be disappointed,” Astrid added, handing her the bag with a smile. “Let me know what you think when you’re done.”

The woman returned the smile. “I will, thanks!”

This was more than a chapter in her life; it was the beginning of a narrative where she held the pen, scripting her story one day at a time. Within the cozy walls of the bookstore café, Astrid discovered a job and a sanctuary where she could be herself.

Astrid’s phone vibrated against the countertop. She glanced at the screen, her heart sinking as she recognized her mother’s number. With a deep breath, she stepped into the storeroom for privacy and answered.

“Hi, Mom,” her voice was steady, but inside, an all-too-familiar anxiety churned.

“Hello, dear,” came the response, tinged with that unmistakable note of reservation. “I just wanted to check in on you.”

The words were innocent enough, but Astrid could hear the subtext, the silent judgment that seemed to hang between them these days. The calls had grown infrequent, each one a painful reminder of the widening gap between them. It wasn’t just the physical distance—it was the fact that Astrid was no longer the person she had been when they moved back to Denver. Yet, she still had to pretend to be their loving son since she could not risk being found out. Astrid was still not sure how she was going to come out to her parents, but she knew it was not right now.

“I’m doing well, Mom. The job is great, and I’ve been…happy.” She fought to keep her tone light, to bridge the distance with optimism she struggled to feel.

“That’s good, dear,” her mother replied, the hesitation palpable. “Your father and I just worry about you, is all.”

“I know.” And she did. The concern was genuine but wrapped in layers of misperception and denial—a gulf that seemed impossible to cross.

After a few more strained pleasantries, Astrid hung up, feeling the weight of their conversation like a stone in her stomach. She leaned back against the shelves, closed her eyes, and allowed herself a moment of weakness. The isolation from her family was a sharp pain, a constant ache that seemed to grow with each passing day.

With a heavy heart, she returned to the front of the café, tucking away the pain as best she could. She couldn’t let it interfere with her work or her journey. There was too much at stake.

Later, in the quiet sanctuary of her apartment, Astrid sat at her desk littered with bills and medical pamphlets. Hormone Replacement Therapy, surgical consultations—the reality of her transition loomed large, both promising and daunting. She picked up a bill for her HRT, the numbers glaring back at her.

Astrid had borrowed money from her parents under the guise of school expenses, a lie that twisted in her gut every time she thought about it. But what choice did she have? The financial burden of aligning her body with her soul was overwhelming, and the guilt of deceit only added to the emotional toll.

She knew the surgeries—facial feminization, breast augmentation—were essential steps on her path, each one bringing her closer to the person she saw when she closed her eyes. Yet, as she tallied the monetary and personal costs, Astrid wondered how high the price of authenticity was.

Each dollar spent was a commitment, a sacrifice etched into the ledger of her future. She sighed, running a hand through her dark red hair, now reflecting the soft glow of her desk lamp. Her gaze drifted to the gaming posters on her walls, the quotes that spoke of bravery and being true to oneself.

“Courage isn’t the absence of fear,” one read, the words shining like a beacon in her dim room. Astrid drew strength from those words, letting them fortify her resolve. Yes, the road ahead was fraught with challenges, but she would walk it with her head held high, for it led to a destination where she could finally live without the mask, without fear—an existence where Astrid could be Astrid.

Astrid’s phone buzzed a reminder of the world beyond her sanctuary. It was a text message from Michelle, checking in as she often did. Her friendship had been a consistent source of comfort. She appreciated her emotional intelligence and ability to listen; she provided a sense of acceptance in a world that often rejected individuals for not fitting into societal norms.

“Hey, just wanted to see how you’re doing,” the message read, punctuated with a smiley face that conveyed warmth through the screen.

“I’m okay,” she typed back, deciding against burdening her with the weight of her current thoughts. Michelle had her complexities to navigate, and while she longed for companionship, Astrid recognized the importance of standing on her own. They were both recovering from past relationships and both learning to redefine themselves.

“Game night this week?” Michelle’s following message popped up.

“Sure, sounds fun,” replied Astrid, grateful for the distraction. Gaming was a respite from society’s eager imposition of stigmas and stereotypes.

She pushed aside her phone and stood up, stretching her limbs like a cat awakening from a nap. Walking over to her mirror, she studied her reflection. The changes were subtle but meaningful; her exterior sculpted closer every day to what she felt inside. Those who couldn’t see beyond their rigid norms would never understand the courage it took to step out the door each morning, to persist in a world that insisted on casting her as other, as less than.

But they didn’t define her—not anymore. Her self-worth wasn’t tied to the acceptance of those unwilling to see her truth.

As the evening wore on, Astrid allowed herself to reminisce about her dating history and the spectrum of connections she’d made along the way. Each person had been a chapter in her story, teaching her more about her complex desires and identity. But she wasn’t searching for someone else to complete her narrative; she alone was the author of her journey.

“Self-acceptance before fulfillment,” she whispered to herself, the mantra a guiding principle as she navigated the intricacies of love and relationships. There was no rush to find another heart to intertwine with hers; there was only the steady, unyielding progression toward a life where she could embrace herself without compromise or fear.

With a sense of clarity, Astrid turned off the lamp, leaving the room illuminated by the moon’s gentle glow. It was time to rest and gather strength for another day filled with challenges and victories. As she settled into bed, surrounded by peaceful darkness, she clung to the belief that each new day would bring her closer to a world that saw her as a woman and a human being worthy of recognition.

 

**…**

 

Astrid nestled further down into the warmth of her bed, the fabric of her sheets a comforting embrace against the chill seeping through her apartment walls. In this quiet sanctum, her thoughts danced between vulnerability and strength, weaving through the memories that had become the foundation of her journey.

In these evening hours, Astrid found a sacred communion with herself; an unspoken dialogue punctuated the stillness. She reflected on the laughter shared over a spontaneous game night, the thrill of finding a perfect cosplay wig after months of searching, and the simple pleasure of her first sip of coffee each morning at the cafe.

Her heart swelled with gratitude for these fragments of joy, glimmering like stars in the vast night sky of her experiences. They were proof of life’s tender mercies amidst the turbulence, evidence that even as the world demanded her to fight for every inch of ground, there remained spaces where she could be.

“Resilience,” she thought, a gentle echo in the silent room. Resilience had carried her through the darkest times, allowing her to embrace the complex hues of her identity. And that same resilience would propel her forward, no matter what lay ahead.

The sudden, jarring sound of paper sliding under her door cleaved the calm of the night, and Astrid’s eyes fluttered open. Her heart seized with a familiar prick of anxiety as she slipped from beneath the covers, feet padding across the floor.

In the sliver of light from the hallway lay an envelope—a portentous intruder in her haven. She picked it up with trembling hands, its contents far heavier than the printed paper. Unfolding the notice, her eyes scanned the words, each a hammer blow to the fragile edifice of her independence: “**Eviction Notice. 30 Days to Vacate**.”

Astrid’s breath caught in her throat as the reality settled around her like shackles. This apartment, her chosen sanctuary adorned with symbols of her true self, was being torn from her grasp. The thought of losing this space—the first place she had ever felt free—was a wound deeper than any rejection or misunderstanding she had yet faced.

The eviction notice was not a demand for her to leave but a reminder of her precarious situation. The stability she had fought so hard to build and her progress in aligning her outward life with her inner truth were now at risk of unraveling.

Yet as the initial shock subsided, something within Astrid began to stir—an ember of defiance, glowing against the encroaching darkness. She was no stranger to adversity; it had been her constant companion throughout her transition. Each setback, each trial by fire, had only tempered her resolve.

“Even this will not defeat me,” Astrid vowed silently, clutching the notice like a declaration of war. She had never had an easy journey, but she traversed it with an unwavering spirit that refused to be extinguished.

With the dawn would come phone calls, pleas for extensions, and the search for a new refuge. But tonight, she allowed herself a moment of grief, a brief mourning for losing her hard-won sanctuary.

As the moon continued its vigil outside her window, Astrid lay back down, the eviction notice folded beside her pillow. Sleep would come, and with it, dreams of a future still unwritten, a life of authenticity that she would continue to pursue with every fiber of her being.

Tomorrow was uncertain, but Astrid knew one thing: she was resilient and would rise again.

Astrid’s hands trembled as she turned the key in the lock of her childhood home. The door swung open to reveal the unchanged interior, a time capsule of a life that no longer fit her. Her mother’s eyes met hers—searching, questioning, laden with a history of unspoken words.

“Hello, Mom,” Astrid said, her voice a mix of grit and vulnerability.

Her mother’s eyes widened, and she hesitated, then stepped forward, enveloping Astrid in an awkward embrace that spoke volumes of their strained relationship. Astrid could feel the resistance in her mother’s arms, the struggle to reconcile the memory of a son with the daughter who now stood before her.

“Your room is as you left it,” her mother said, pulling away to regain composure. “We can talk about,” her mother said as she gestured at her, “everything else later.”

“Thanks, Mom,” Astrid whispered, heading down the hallway that felt both foreign and familiar under her feet.

Dinner was a silent affair, punctuated by the clinking of cutlery and the occasional forced conversation about trivial matters. Astrid’s father sat across from her, his eyes betraying his discomfort. He cleared his throat, finally broaching the subject that loomed over them like a storm cloud.

“Explain this,” her father demanded, his voice sharp as he held up a statement showing the money she had falsely borrowed for ‘school,’ the costs of her transition laid bare between them.

“Every choice I’ve made, every penny I spent, has been toward becoming who I truly am,” Astrid replied, her words measured but firm despite the quiver in her voice.

“Is this who you are now?” her mother interjected, her voice breaking. “Our son, taking money under pretenses?”

“I’m still your child,” Astrid insisted, fighting to keep the surge of emotions from overwhelming her. “I just couldn’t be your son anymore.”

The room became a battleground of values and beliefs, old wounds torn open with each argument. Astrid’s parents grappled with the truth before them while Astrid struggled to bridge the ever-widening chasm with each of her revelations.

“Where did we go wrong?” her father asked her mother, the hurt resonating in each word.

“You didn’t,” Astrid whispered, reaching for a connection that seemed to slip further away. “I was never right until now.”

The confrontation drained into an uneasy silence, leaving a residue of alienation that no amount of shared history could cleanse. That night, Astrid lay in her childhood bed, surrounded by relics of a life that no longer fit her reality. Sleep remained elusive as if rejecting her presence in a space where she could no longer belong.

Returning to her childhood home, Astrid found herself in the middle of a battleground. Her parents’ voices were shouting and accusing, the tension between them palpable as she struggled to make them accept her true identity. But every attempt at communication only intensified their rage, driving them further apart. Day by day, the divide between Astrid and her family widened, becoming deeper and impossible to bridge.

Desperate to escape them, she tried reaching out to old friends, hoping to rekindle connections that had once provided solace. She tried dialing numbers she had written down and leaving messages, but each attempt was met with silence or a brief, polite response that lacked warmth. The realization hit her hard; the community she had left, which she had once been part of, was leaving her behind.

As the temperature dropped on a chilly spring evening in Denver and the tension between them escalated, Astrid knew things would come to a head. Amid yet another heated argument, she trembled as she grabbed her trusty black leather jacket and messenger bag - the only things that gave her a sense of security - and stormed out of the house for the last time. As she walked away from her childhood home and her enraged father, she couldn’t help but feel adrift and alone in the unfamiliar streets of this once-familiar city. The warmth and comfort of Colorado Springs, which had recently been her home, now felt like a distant memory compared to the harsh reality of living in the bustling Denver metro area.

Astrid’s resolve hardened as the sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the world in shades of twilight. The road ahead was daunting, filled with uncertainty and the challenge of forging new paths. But she had traveled too far, fought too hard, to let the specter of rejection define her journey.

With a deep breath, Astrid started walking, the hum of the thuds of her feet a reminder of the life that pulsed within her. She would face tomorrow with courage, knowing that her quest for acceptance began with self-acceptance and that no solitude could diminish her true identity.

Two torturous weeks of aimless wandering through the unforgiving streets of Denver and its suburbs had led to this pivotal moment. Raindrops pelted down, drenching Astrid’s clothes with a chill seeping into her bones as she reached a house from her distant past. Each step was a calculated risk, a heartbeat thudding in her chest like a war drum. This could be her final chance at salvation. The warm light radiating from the house’s windows called to her like a beacon of hope amidst the gathering storm, urging her forward with a desperate urgency.

She paused at the foot of the porch steps, her breath forming a mist in the chilly evening air. This was where Johnny, a constant friend in middle school, had lived with his family many years ago. If they were still here, they were the last of all the people she had known back then. The white picket fence surrounding the house was now worn and chipped from weather and time, a symbol of what used to be. As she lifted her hand to knock on the door, each droplet of rain cascading off her leather jacket reminded her of the journey that brought her to this moment. It felt like a weighty decision that required immense courage and vulnerability to face whatever lay beyond those doors.

Three loud knocks echoed through the silent street, growing in volume with each repetition as they bounced off the surrounding buildings. The heavy rain was now falling in sheets, drowning out her racing thoughts. Astrid stood on the porch, scanning the deserted road behind her. The faint glow of the streetlights stretched long shadows that swayed in rhythm with the howling wind, a chilling dance that mirrored her inner turmoil. A shiver ran down her spine as a gust of cold air swept over her.

Her mind wandered through the mosaic of memories—the electric thrill of stepping onto the stage in high school, the sanctuary of cosplaying in the privacy of her room, and the bittersweet tang of fleeting connections with those who shared her passions. Every high and low had sculpted her, a journey of relentless struggle and fleeting moments of joy.

Standing on the precipice of another beginning or another ending, Astrid wrapped her arms around herself, seeking warmth against the drenching rain. The tempest outside was fierce, but it was no match for the storm that had raged inside her all these years—the battle to emerge as her authentic self, to live without the suffocating constraints of fear and doubt.

The darkness of the night enveloped Astrid as she stood outside the once familiar house, whispering her desperate plea for someone she knew to live there still. She hugged her arms tightly, trying to ward off the chill that had settled in her bones. Exhausted from days of searching, she had visited countless houses, hoping to find a trace of her childhood friends. All those avenues were now exhausted, save this one. Will it open for me? she wondered silently, her heart racing with anticipation and fear.

The rain intensified, droplets weaving rivulets down her cheeks, causing her makeup to run, indistinguishable from the tears that had started to mix with the downpour causing her makeup to run down her face. Yet, even as the cold seeped into her bones, Astrid held onto the ember of hope that had carried her this far—that beyond the threshold lay acceptance, that within the walls of this house, she might find a fragment of the home she longed for.

Her eyes scanned the neighborhood around her, struggling to recognize the area again, each house whispering tales of a forgotten youth. The streets were empty in the storm, save for the occasional passing car. The rain, relentless in its downpour, seemed to mirror her internal turmoil. Looking back at the house, she remembered the laughter, the shared secrets of youth, and the dreams that once danced in these streets. Now, they were echoing in the void of her heart.

As she stood there, shivering and drenched, Astrid couldn’t help but reflect on her journey and recent events. The highs of her early days as Astrid, filled with excitement, the newfound freedoms, new friends, and new locales, now felt like distant memories. Sometimes, the weight of it all made her question what she was doing. Several times over the past few years, things had gotten so hard with the depression that she had considered giving up and transitioning back. But with her doctor’s help, she had gotten past the dark times. The nightclubs, the vibrant community she had found, the joy of expressing her true self—were all so recent, yet they now seemed like chapters from another life.

But amidst all the good memories, the sting of rejection from those she thought would always be there loomed large. Her parents’ inability to see her, to accept her, and their single-mindedness only to see what they thought they lost had left a deep scar. The harsh words as she had stormed from the house, the finality of the door slamming behind her was a rejection of her very being.

Astrid’s story was one of courage and resilience, of a daily battle to live as her true self. Yet, that battle was taking its toll—especially over the last two weeks on the streets. The world had shown her its harsh face, yet she had tried to persist. But now, as the rain soaked her to the bone, her resolve wavered.

She thought of the friends she had lost, the dreams she had let go for now, and the loneliness that had become her recent companion. The weight of her struggles pressed down on her, each step a testament to her determination, yet each step also a reminder of her vulnerability. But the dark thoughts always lingered in the background when times were hard like this. Memories of people who gave up in similar circumstances came to the forefront of her mind. “I have to push these things out of my mind and not give up. What you have done is right. Never question that.” she thought to herself.

As she raised her hand to knock again, her heart raced with fear and hope. She knew someone was home…she could see the light in the living room and hear them inside. This place might be her last resort, a final place to plea for help in a world that seemed to have turned its back on her. The door before her was more than an entrance to a house; it was a gateway to a past she had left behind more than a decade ago and an uncertain future.

At that moment, standing in the rain, Astrid realized the full magnitude of all her choices. From the highs of self-discovery to the sting of rejection and despair, her life had been a journey of contrasting experiences. And now, at this crossroads, she was about to take a step that could change everything.

“No one is coming to help you,” she thought. She shook her head, “Stop it.” Astrid took a deep breath, lifted her hand, and knocked on the door harder this time, the sound echoing in the quiet street. She stood there, waiting, her heart in her throat, wondering if this would be the moment that would lead her back to a semblance of the life she had lost or if it would be another door closed in her face.",2,1737845681.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I'm doing my first n scale layout. I've gone through about 3 or 4 versions of track layouts now, using anyrail 7. I'm limited to 54""x28"" table for this layout, and is not a permanent layout. I may transition this track from a table top to a permanent setup in the future, but for the time being i'm looking for a track layout I can have some constant runners going as well as operate a smaller locomotive doing some operations work in the inglenook and the timesaver with freight rolling stock. I'm open to any advice for design choices on this layout. I'm planning this for Kato Unitrack in n-scale. This is going to be my first DCC track ever, and my first track that I've had in probably 30 years. My knowledge is limited on model railroad equipment, but I have decided on a Digitrax controller. My question is, where do I actually need power feeds?",2,1737845556.0,nscalemodeltrains,0,1.0,False

I’m travelling solo through Nanaimo in a few days and will be there only for a few hours before noon.  I’m looking for a comfortable spot for a solo traveller to sit and enjoy a great breakfast.  Nothing fancy and nothing cramped.  Proximity to water is always a plus since I plan on going for a walk down by the water to stretch my legs before a few more hours in the car.  

Emphasis on a place that’s comfortable for a solo traveller.  I enjoy my solitude and value a comfortable place to relax with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich.  If there’s girls in big brimmed hats taking pictures of their food and drinking mimosas I probably won’t like it.  haha 

Thank you in advance.  I’m looking forward to visiting for the first time.  ",3,1737845551.0,nanaimo,23,0.64,False

I've been toying with this recipe on an off. I've made several cakes and idk maybe the type I'm going for just needs to be a bundt cake or something. It's meant to be a layer cake but it's it's fine with me if it ends up not being a sponge type cake. 

What I'm looking for is a dense cake, that has a tight crumb, but is a little fudgey without needing to soak the sponge with a syrup. I'd like it to be super chocolaty. More cakey and lighter than brownies but not as airy as a sponge for birthday cake. 

If you think I should just scrap it and make a bundt cake or chocolate pound cake, please just say so. Tysm.
