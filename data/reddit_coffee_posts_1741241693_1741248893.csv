She was his dog but  I grew very close with her where she would start sleeping in my room at nights over the 5+ years I lived with them but even after my buddy got married and I moved out I still saw her all the time on camping trips, dog sitting or the usual weekend party where she’d end up sleeping with me on the couch or spare room. I miss the morning routine where Id wake up and start to stretch and she would bow and stretch with me at the end of the bed and then I’d say good morning and ask are you hungry and she would get all happy and then put her paws on my shoulders and give me kisses and then I’d get up and feed her and she’d hang out with me while I had some coffee before I headed home.",2,1741248255.0,Cutedogsreddit,0,1.0,False

I've recently noticed that the grind is taking a bit longer and is higher pitched than it was. I did some searching, found this sub, and it seemed that this might be due to oily beans. Sure enough, my wife replaced the coffee beans with a different brand while I was on a long work trip, and they were pretty oily.

  
Most of the bag was finished by that point, but I removed what was left, cleaned the machine, and did the standard maintenance. The coffee seems fine, but the sound and duration of the grind hasn't changed.

  
Have I potentially misdiagnosed the problem? Should I be concerned about the sound of the grinder? Is there anything else I should do?

1j4qk6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j4qk6m/how_does_a_34_year_old_male_virgin_with_6/,How does a 34 year old male virgin with 6 biological children start a relationship?,"During my teenage years I thought my lack of money was the reason I was alone. So I worked hard to get a job and money. Then during my 20s I tried to get a date, to speak to women, but I got no matches on dating apps and websites. When I would speak to a woman in the real world it would lead nowhere. Now I had the money to take women out, a car to travel around I still had zero interest from women.

When I was 26 I went backpacking alone for 4 months. I was meeting female travellers every week, and for the first time in my life women were speaking to me. I would meet women and often spend several days travelling with the same woman, an experience very much like a date. Doing this for 4 months I became very good at dates. Towards the end of my trip I managed to kiss a woman for the first time in my life when I was in Venice. I wasn't expecting to even meet women when the acorn of travelling was planted in my head.

I go back to the UK, with a stack of cool backpacking photos I could use on dating apps and I managed to get a date and the courage to kiss her on our first date. This turned into a relationship. However, despite being able to masturbate fine, I couldn’t easily get an erection with a physical woman. I did technically have sex a few times, but I was terrible. So the relationship died.

I spent the next 3 years alone, I had accepted the fact I could never have a relationship and moved forward with my life.

Then a perfect storm hit in 2021. I logged into a dating app, not with the goal of finding a relationship, but just looking for someone to have an adventure with. After a few weeks, with incredible luck a woman started speaking to me, then video calling me. She was recently divorced after marrying a man who turned out to be infertile, wanting a child she decided to divorce. Now she wanted to know how fertile I am, she was 34 years old and with no time to waste. Knowing how complicated my situation was I decided to break things off before a first date, I was largely wasting her time.

But it made me question my fertility, so I started researching the subject and somehow I stumbled upon sperm donation groups on Facebook. I observed the groups for a few weeks, the posts were a mix of single women and couples looking for a sperm donor and the sperm donors advertising themselves. Donating sperm like this has a steep learning curve, and often involves “dates” to meet with the women and couples. But within a month I was in contact with several couples who had agreed to have children with me.

Fantastically, I found having children orders of magnitude easier than getting a date at a coffee shop. Within the year I had 3 children, and within 2 years I had 6 children. I speak to the couples, we sometimes go out for drinks, I see the children, they call me dad but I’m not on any of the birth certificates as I only donated to married lesbian couples.

Now I’m 34 and travelling around the world again, I tried to kiss the 3rd woman in my life and she rejected me. I could easily have 100 children, but I cant find a woman who will let me buy her a coffee. Most of my value to a woman is based around my potential to have children, which only became a factor when trying to date women in their 30s.

I would like to think I can have a normal romantic and sexual relationship with a woman, but how can I move forward? The only women that will speak to me are women in their mid 30s who want children immediately, I'm open to having a child with one of these women, but I don’t know if I can even have sex. I think I need to have a large number of actual dates and opportunities for sexual encounters in a short period of time. But that is a fantasy, how can I possibly make this happen?

I seemingly have everything in life except a relationship.

TL;DR I had difficulty meeting women, I went travelling later in life, kissed a woman for the first time at 26 years old, found I couldn’t even have sex any more, privately donated sperm, I don’t know how to move forward.",0,1741247943.0,dating_advice,4,0.33,False

We tossed around a few ideas, but one place kept coming up: Monaco. Sun, luxury, supercars, and the kind of lifestyle you only see in movies. It was a no-brainer.

The only problem? We didn’t want just any hotel stay. We wanted the full experience—our own place, privacy, and something that actually felt like we were living the Monaco dream. That’s when we started looking into villa rentals instead of hotels. After way too much scrolling through generic listings, we finally came across a site that actually had what we were looking for: Nightfall Group. Their villas? Insane. Like, the kind of places you’d imagine F1 drivers and celebrities staying in.

We ended up booking a modern glass-walled villa on the hills, overlooking the yachts and the coastline. The second we walked in, we knew we made the right choice. The infinity pool alone was worth it. Mornings were spent having coffee on the terrace, afternoons cruising around in a rented Ferrari (because when in Monaco…), and evenings either at Monte Carlo’s casinos or just enjoying the villa like it was our own private resort.

Honestly, I’ve never stayed somewhere like that before. Hotels are nice, sure, but there’s something about having your own space, your own kitchen, and zero interruptions that just hits different. If you’re ever thinking about doing Monaco properly, I’d 100% recommend checking out villa rentals. It’s a game-changer.

Would I do it again? In a heartbeat. Now the only question is—where next? 😏",1,1741247887.0,u_Zestyclose_Boat8829,0,1.0,False

1j4qiwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1j4qiwr/story_time_i_guess_just_wanted_to_rant_about_my/,"Story time I guess, just wanted to rant about my crush","Long post ahead, feel free to read if you want. Heads up for direct quotes, I’m trying my best to translate it to English but some just don’t have a direct English translation and might sound weird, so yeah. 

I (F, 16) met him at school and I honestly just noticed for a while that he hovers wherever I was, like it was just coincidence after coincidence (genuinely was, there was no way of knowing we’d both see each other at that specific time at that specific place). I also made it really clear back then that I wasn’t interested in a relationship (since I confessed to my online friend back then but he rejected me) but I just kept hearing him bringing up my name and I noticed that he’d keep talking to his friends about whatever I was doing, now since I’m an INTJ I just kept on observing him and was curious on what he’ll do. Will he interact with me? Talk with me? Say hi? He really didn’t interact with me much. Then after a while of observing him, I found his smile to be really cute, the way he laughs is cute too. He’s also really amazing, insanely smart, insanely handsome, and I have a type for nerds. Then one day, it was our second semester and we had to introduce ourselves again, when it was his turn, we made eye contact and my heart just wouldn’t stop beating, it literally hurt (like a 6/10 pain kind, I rank migraines as a 4/10) and I couldn’t focus on the lessons for the rest of the day. Didn’t stop when I got back home, complained about it to my bestie and she just said “Ah so you like him” and yeah, I couldn’t deny it. Also while observing him I found out we have similar humor and have the same movements, I have this habit of resting my face on my hand in a specific way and he does it the same way too. Recently, I asked him out, but he rejected me and I was honestly surprised because he showed all of these signs, but then he rejected me, I also prepared a gift for him because I was sure he liked me back, and he rejected the gift too, saying he didn’t want to give me false hope. I was actually so heartbroken about it and after that, I told my friends about it and they just spent time with me, trying to cheer me up. He even sent me a text later on, saying how he didn’t mean to be rude when he rejected my gift but that he also wanted to make it clear and didn’t want to give me false hope. So I said alright, thanks for saying that, I understand. Now, the next few days, I saw that he still kept glancing at me and I overheard him say to his friends that he regrets rejecting me, then when his friends asked why he even rejected me in the first place, he said it was because “I was too pretty” and “I regret texting her that long message”. Now I felt like I heard something I shouldn’t. Anyways, we were grouped for research and he’s seated in front of me but a bit to the left. And it was so goddamn awkward, I was also grouped with his friends so those few weeks were just absolutely “fun” (thank god it was the last subject though). Luckily, I was in like the last row and can bolt outside the classroom asap. I honestly just kept doing that because I didn’t know how to face him with all that I knew and stuff. Anyways fast forward a few more weeks and coincidences keep happening again one at a time, we would arrive at school at similar times, accidentally meet up at specific places, and all that kind of stuff again. Then one day, it was break time, I was planning on taking a nap with my headphones on, and as I was trying to nap when I suddenly heard him say “She’s so confusing” “I feel like she’s just leading me on” “She’s so pretty”. Now I wasn’t sure if he was talking to me then, but after classes, we were waiting for the time to go to our clubs (we can stay in our classroom before heading there). Going to clubs is optional and my crush and his friends decided not to go to clubs that day. So I decided to complain to my friend “Haha, he’s just leading me on” “It hurts (being lead on)”. But then I heard a classmate gossip to another classmate and they said “Huh? Could she not hear what (insert crush name) was talking about?” another replied “She was using her headphones” “Damn, how loud were her headphones for her not to hear that?” And I was honestly taken aback. “So he was referring to me?” Anyways I texted him about it and told him “Hey, about that thing that you said during break time earlier, was that directed at me? I heard some of our classmates gossip about it.. and they actually called me (insert something rude/insult) and it honestly hurts, sorry but I might be overthinking it and they might be misunderstanding things because didn’t you already reject me? if what they’re saying is true, then your words and actions aren’t aligning. But if you don’t feel the same, can you clear it up with them? I’ll also talk to them about it so we’re not gossiped about this”. (It was something much longer but this was the gist of it. I also told him about the signs that he did in the past regarding me, and I said that the reason I confessed was because I thought the feeling was mutual and sorry for bothering him about this). After a few hours, he replied (he usually replies to my text asap, but this one took like a few hours) He denied some stuff like how I kept bringing out the eye contact thing and it literally “doesn’t mean anything” and said that he didn’t want to give me mixed signals and false hope since he knows that it’s something hurtful and that he’ll talk to the people who gossiped about it. So I was like “Damn.. Really no chance with him huh.. Haha he just lead me on..” I even cried about it since I was actually losing my goddamn mind about this hahaha….. Then come the next school day (we didn’t have school for like 4 days) and I cleared up the issue with the gossiper, what happened was just a coincidence and I just misunderstood, they weren’t referring to me when they said it and we hugged it out, but then they said “You know, I was actually surprised because (insert crush name) sent a text in the group chat and he was angry about this (they had their own group chat because they were friends) but we didn’t know what he was talking about”. And I was like “Eh, really he got mad?” I thought to myself “Damn he must not like having people misunderstand that he liked me, ok bro”. I also didn’t think he was the type to get mad because he seems pretty chill like 24/7. Anyways come the next day and I saw him and his friends in like a circle and them using someone’s phone and they were talking about something, couldn’t really hear it clearly but then I heard my crush say “You know I was actually really mad about this and look at her she’s just chilling there using her mini fan, it’s actually kind of annoying haha”. Anddddd guess who was using a mini fan? Yea me (It couldn’t have been the others because the aircon was on and I still felt a bit sweaty because we just went outside for the flag ceremony, but the room was fairly cold at this point, and only me and another person, a guy, was using a minifan). Now, by this point, you’d think if he’s doing all of that, that means he must’ve done something about the part rejecting me in the past? Like explain it a bit, yeah, uh no. I was honestly confused at this point on why he kept saying it and directing it at me when HE REJECTED ME. Anyways fast forward a few days and now it’s exam week. I arrived somewhat early to class and went straight to my friends and decided to use my headset so I could review a bit before our exams started. Then before I could start playing the music (had placed my headphones on at this point, I heard my crush say “She won’t be able to hear me again HAHAHA”. Honestly, I swear to motherfuckinggodwhattheactualfuck YOU’RE SO DAMN CONFUSING. Like his words and actions don’t fucking align but then when I’ll start getting annoyed and mad about it (I usually don’t show emotions like that, and he might not know I’m feeling that way) but I keep hearing him say that I’m “pretty” or that I’m “cute”, so I just somewhat feel less annoyed and mad. Anyways lo’ and behold I hear him say to his friends “Should I tell her already?” And I’m there listening to my music and thinking “Huh, what is he going to tell me? SHIT IS HE GOING TO CONFESS?????” LIKE DUDE IT’S EXAM WEEK YOU REALLY WANNA CONFESS NOW OUT OF ALL TIMES?????? Anyway, I heard his friends talk and reason with him and they said “Dude it’s exam week, just say it next week”. And I hear him say “Damn it brooo, I really wanna say it to her already”. EXCUSE YOU???? ARE YOU OK?????? IT’S THE FIRST DAY OF THE EXAM WEEK AND WE STILL HAVE 2 DAYS LEFT TO GO!!! (We have a total of 3 days for our periodic exams). Also later on, during like a quick break time because we finished a test early, he went out to the restroom and came back using the front door. So at first you know I was curious, I thought “Ah it might be our teacher” “Time to take the next test” but NOPE it was HIM. We accidentally made eye contact (lasted like 3-5 seconds) and tell me why when he got back to his seat, he wouldn’t sit still? Like one of his legs was SHAKING then he looked back at my seat. I’m here thinking “Hm? Tf this dude doing? Didn’t he say our eye contact meant nothing and it was just him drifting off, and it was a coincidence that we made eye contact like WHY IS HE ACTING LIKE THIS??? YOUR WORDS REALLY DON’T ALIGN FFS! Anyways uh yeah, after that, we had another test (the last one for the day) and I couldn’t focus on it, don’t even remember what I answered, I was busy shaking because we made eye contact, and I just bolted outside of the classroom as fast as I could when the teacher said we could go home. As I was bolting to the door I heard one of his friends say “(insert my name) ran (or got) away HAHAHA” and I heard my crush say “Seriously? Bro she’s walking so fast”. Then I got home. Now then, come the next day. It’s currently our second day of examinations and I got to class pretty early this time (1 hour before exams were about to start), but my crush got there earlier than me. He’s with his group of friends and I’m sitting in my seat trying to review with my headphones on again, and I heard him say “Bro I really want to say it to her alreadyyy” “She’s so cute” and I heard his friends try to reason with him again “Dude, she won’t be able to focus on the exam if you say it to her now” “Maybe say it after we finish answering the last exam”. Then after that, he said sure and they talked about something else. Fast forward, it’s now the last exam for the day (General Chemistry), we had so much to calculate for this exam omfg. Anyways, once people were done, they could leave and go home. People slowly left and I was there still calculating I looked around and saw that only 3 people (including me) were still taking the test. Me, HIM, and a classmate of ours. He finished earlier than me and he went outside with his friend and came back into the classroom with his friend. Lemme remind you, the teacher was still there lol. While I was still trying to calculate the last question I heard him whisper to his friend “Bro I’ll tell her”. And I was like there thinking “NOPE ISTG DON’T CONFESS TODAY OR FOR A MATTER OF FACT, TOMORROW”. Anyway, I’m really not mentally prepared for a confession yet, maybe next week? I’ve been running on 2 hours of sleep for the past 2 days already, drinking 2 cups of coffee each. Having to think and reply to a confession is the least of my worries right now. Anyway, I just packed my stuff quickly and bolted outside, went to the girls' restroom so that if he actually planned to confess, he couldn’t. 

Sorry, but I’ll actually have to stop here. It's currently the second day of our exams and tomorrow’s gonna be the last day. I might edit this if he does something? Thanks for reading I guess, I just wanted to rant lmao. 

TLDR: Me and my crush are both idiots 🤷‍♀️ we’re both academically smart but uh yeah lmao.

Forgot to add: I could hear all of the things he said because I have quite sensitive ears, and I use my headset so I won’t get overwhelmed. I have really bad anxiety and listening to music while I do my stuff just helps me have a clear mind. ",1,1741247788.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1j4qh1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1j4qh1b/10_years_of_mystery_ailment_no_one_would_diagnose/,10+ years of mystery ailment no one would diagnose was... just carpal tunnel syndrome! This is a long vent-scream.,"I have carpal tunnel release surgery scheduled for next month. Endoscopic so it won't be as big of a pain (literally and logistically afterwards! I'm so relieved I'm not going to have to live in a splint for a while!). I'm hopeful for the first time in years, and I'm also so... so mad. I just... here is the sequence of events between the beginning of my symptoms and getting my diagnosis. Content warning for (predictably, I suppose) medical incompetence, assault, fatphobia, and abuse. Content warning also for vicious and unmitigated hatred of general practitioners and family nurse practitioners, for which I am not and never will be sorry.

2007-ish: I'm still in high school. I start getting pain and a weird uncomfortable feeling I can't really describe in my right hand when I have to write multi-page essays or lengthy notes in class. It's only an occasional thing but it's a bit upsetting.

February 2014: I'm in my early 20s. I have to drop out of college because the pain in my wrists (and now my shoulder) is too severe. I go to the doctor. They tell me to take ibuprofen and rest for a few weeks.

March-August 2014: Monthly visits to the doctor. The answer is almost always still ""take some ibuprofen and rest."" I do eventually get sent for a nerve conduction study which doesn't turn up anything interesting. (Years later I learned these tests are, at least on their own, less reliable for diagnosing CTS than my doctor apparently wanted to believe.)

September 2014: Doctor decides my pain is actually depression and offers me an SSRI. I agree to it, not because I believe my pain isn't real, but because I've definitely always had depression and anxiety and dealing with that has been on my to-do list anyway, so whatever. I might as well give it a shot. Turns out SSRIs are, to put it lightly, *not for me*, as evidenced by an adverse reaction I would later find out might have been serotonin syndrome. Doctor denies it's even possible for me to have had such an outsized reaction on day 1, and that I must just be ""overthinking things,"" contributing further to the shattered state of my mental health. I'm told to keep taking it for 2 weeks and I'll probably even out. On the 14th day I am just as panicky and nauseous as the first day, and several pounds lighter, because I mostly haven't been able to eat anything but saltines. I throw the bottle in the garbage and tell them, go to my follow-up appointment, and tell them nothing got any better. The doctor sees fit to tell me I was overweight anyway, so rapidly losing weight from nausea and vomiting and anxiety-starvation is probably fine! HAHAHAA AUAUAUUAGH I hate doctors ^I ^hate ^doctors ^^I ^^hate ^^doctors ^^so ^^much

October-December 2014: I slowly re-learn how to be outside my house without having a panic attack. (Mostly. The panic attacks will continue with some regularity until about 2017.) Meanwhile, I'm seeing a counselor who is totally dismissive about how much pain I'm in, who can't understand that no, I actually would not be able to do an ""easy"" job like a coffee shop in as much pain as I'm in.

January 2015: I am finally referred to physical therapy, but all they do is like... slap one of those like... I think like, infrared warming things on me for a while? And send me on my way? No stretches or anything. After a few visits and no improvement they tell me they can't help me and won't schedule any more appointments. WTF????

February 2015: I go back to the doctor. She's apparently sick of me, and when I ask what else we can do about my shoulder pain she decides it would be super cool to **commit a breezy little assault against me**. I kid you not. I'd prefer not to get into the details because it's triggering and having to describe it again is a day-ruiner. I knew it was my word against hers, and I was too tired to fight about it, so I just stayed silent for a long time, but I finally filed a complaint about this assault last year (after my therapist encouraged me to do so). THEN I found out from an investigator that this absolute demon who assaulted me also *wrote down in my chart that my wrist and shoulder pain was ""psychogenic""*. Cool! Literally just sabotaged me for no reason. I assume this is part of the reason the rest of the trouble happened.

March 2015: I ditch the whole clinic and go to a new one. I am diagnosed with Maybe It's Bursitis. (All mentions of my wrist pain are ignored and dismissed.) We try a steroid shot, which clears up some of the shoulder pain for like 2 days and stops working.

Sometime during summer of 2015: I return to the doctor and make the mistake of letting on that being in pain 24/7 has had a noticeable negative impact on my mental health and quality of life. This startling revelation (PERSON WHO IS IN PAIN ALL THE TIME AND CAN'T ENGAGE WITH A SINGLE ONE OF HER HOBBIES ANYMORE... ***SAD?!*** *SHOCKER.*) prompts her to try to diagnose me with bipolar syndrome and prescribe me some brain meds of serious consequence. This is a general practitioner who does not have any particular specialty in mental health. Thankfully my new therapist was like ""What? *No.* WHAT? No????""

Fall 2015: I browbeat my doctor into browbeating my insurance into paying for an MRI. I am told the MRI results are ""normal."" Spoilers: They are not actually normal! More on this later!

Winter 2015: I get sent to a pain management clinic to take classes on how to accept that I'll never get better and that I should simply grin and bear it. Hilariously, my doctor *did* give me a one-time prescription for tramadol, and I experienced real pain relief for the first time in over a year, but of course I never could get a refill because [reason not given]. I guess that was kinda when the hammer was coming down re: the ""opioid crisis"" (AKA the Doctors Not Teaching People How To Use Opioid Medication Safely Because They're Lazy and Incompetent and Easily Bribed Crisis).

2016-2023: I just give up on getting a diagnosis for a while, but things do kinda get better. I ration the single bottle of tramadol for my absolute worst days over the next year. I make some strides with treatment at home-- bracing my wrist when it's at rest, experimenting with ice and heat and stretches, improving the ergonomics of my work station. I basically just do my best to self-diagnose via the internet and try out things I can do easily at home. Very slowly, I start to regain some limited function, and I learn to exist within my new limitations, until in late 2023, everything goes to hell again, and I stop being able to draw, write, type, etc. for more than a few minutes without pain.

Early 2024: I call up an orthopedic specialist, because I refuse to ever see a general practitioner again if I can avoid it. The specialist pulls up my old MRI results and is like... no, these aren't normal. There's inflammation there. I get sent to PT, still without a diagnosis, but with some hope that like... my pain has finally been acknowledged as A Real Thing That's Happening. That's a first! 

Mid-2024: 2 months of physical therapy helps a *lot*, but...

Late 2024: I've slipped back down the hole, and things are getting even worse. I'm losing dexterity now, which is scary.

February 2025: I go back to the orthopedic specialist and tell him how PT went, and what the aftermath was like. He asks questions. I answer. He actually listens to the answers. He pokes a thing on my arm and I go *AUGH SYMPTOMS*. He diagnoses me with carpal tunnel syndrome on the spot and tells me we can get going on surgery ASAP. I'm *stunned.*

TODAY: I'm in a ""what if it's really something else, though! This was too easy! It's *never* this easy!!!"" pre-surgery anxiety spiral, and while reading up on carpal tunnel syndrome vs. cubital tunnel syndrome I found out that *shoulder pain is apparently a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome that often gets missed.* Had cameras been present I would have looked directly into them, as if on The Office.

So that's how it took 11 years for me to get a carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis. Missing from this story is every other time I've been messed with by doctors (a lot of times. a LOT of times). CTS isn't the only chronic condition I suffer from. It was just the problem that was the most personally devastating to my daily life and mental health, and now there's some actual hope on the horizon. I don't know if I've ever make a *full* recovery, but it seems like the success rate is pretty good. 

I'm just... so furious at how long it took to get here. Furious at how so many people who enter the medical field are so deeply incurious and cruel and criminally stupid. Furious that I was successfully tortured by these cruel, stupid, incurious people into giving up on my health for a while. Furious that something so simple was treated like a medical mystery in front of me and like a lie in my chart (not that psychogenic pain is a ""lie"" or doesn't happen, but you know... to the GP/FNP mind, the difference between a lie and something they aren't experiencing personally is apparently not medically significant). Carpal tunnel syndrome can be a little sneaky if it isn't presenting with all the classic symptoms, but if we did any running in the wrong direction, it should have been down *nearby* avenues like ""maybe it's tendonitis?"", not all the way across town into ""maybe you're just bipolar and somehow that's making you THINK you're in pain."" Thinking of what could have been hurts so much. I pretty much lost the first decade of my adult life to this. When I think of every day I spent sobbing in bed because I couldn't draw, I couldn't write, I couldn't play video games, I couldn't even hold a book open, even biking was out because I couldn't deal with hand brakes anymore and didn't feel safe... it's maddening. Maddening that I had to do my own research and try to treat it myself, not even knowing for sure what it was. With competent care, this ordeal could have maybe been measured in months instead of years, and I probably wouldn't have PTSD, and I'd probably be way better at drawing by now, *and* I probably would have gotten to finish Elden Ring.

Instead I got sent on a wild goose chase, with the ultimate diagnosis ruled out a few months in by an unreliable test and the personal bias of someone who clearly just *didn't like me*, didn't want to deal with my problems, and wrote down lies in my chart. And ASSAULTED ME. Jesus! It's not that I'm naive or anything, but it does always boggle me a bit to encounter people who are actually just *evil.* I hope the investigation struck fear into her heart, or whatever infernal demonic organ situation she has going on in there.

Anyway. I'm tired. I'm scared. I'm boiling with rage. I'm also really excited, and more hopeful than I've felt in years. It's a strange place to be in. If I actually make a full recovery, it's gonna be so weird, like when they let a rehabilitated wild animal out of captivity or something.",5,1741247551.0,ChronicPain,1,1.0,False

1j4qg3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1j4qg3f/consistency/,Consistency,"After posting here a few times and reading a lot more I realized that when I was talking to my LL (mildly autistic) wife about the lack of intimacy over the last few years I was just more or less complaining without trying to figure out why. So two weekends ago I asked her a few questions:

1. When we first got together and the sex was all you could think about, why did that change? Were you “masking” without realizing it and unintentionally being performative in the way you thought was normal?

The answer to this question doesn’t really change anything for me because the autism diagnosis didn’t change anything about how I feel about her. It was always obvious to me and I didn’t care. Doesn’t change who she is and I still love her. She answered and it was “yes I was probably unknowingly masking”. I don’t feel duped or lied too. I just wanted to know. 

2. Since she doesn’t initiate and doesn’t let me know when she’s in the mood can we work out a signal? A certain coffee mug turned upside down? Something like that. Zero communication on this one. 

3. What turns you on? After 8 years of missionary sex when we actually have sex once every 5 months and zero communication of what she’s into I feel like I don’t know her sexually. I’m willing to try anything but bring another person into the bedroom. We’re married, let’s get weird. Who cares? I’m very open. I always have been. She’s not and that does bother me because I just want her to be comfortable especially during sex. And obviously I want her to have the best time. 9/10 times she orgasms but I want her to be able to talk about her desires. There’s zero foreplay and that bums me out. Zero answer to this question so far. She used to love smut books but remains adamant she doesn’t want anything like that. The books are for her in her head and she doesn’t want to roleplay or anything. I even offered to read a book of her choice after one of you guys suggested it and she said no. 

4. What would you change about me? What can I do differently? These answers really bummed me out because they were purely physical. She hates my scene mullet (think the 2010s mall kids mixed with Steve from stranger things) and when I have a mustache (which is rare). These are things that can be changed in an instant. She’s admittedly shallow but I didn’t think it was that shallow. So I scheduled a haircut and told her if she’s able to figure out what turns her on and communicate that by my haircut I’ll cut it off. It’s just hair, at the end of the day I don’t care that much about it. And I’m willing to stay consistent with the haircuts as long as she’s able to stay consistent with intimacy, not just sex. But connecting. Passion. Being present when we’re together. Not buried in her computer. 

The next night we actually had sex. It was about as good as two people who have sex once every 5 months can be but I’ll take what I can get. Still no answers to my questions though. My haircut is this Friday. Wednesday morning I reminded her of that and I would like her to give some thought to what she wants out of the sexual aspect of our relationship and she told me she hasn’t given it any thought. So I told her the mullet is gonna stay and she wasn’t happy about that. But I mean …oh well? 

Idk I guess I’m just ranting. I feel like once again I’m the only one putting in real effort to make things better in our love life. ",2,1741247429.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

He will begin by trying to find an answer to let's say ""impossible"" question and in that very question lies the answer through negation. For example I want to find out what love is I have to see what love isn't. Below an excerpt of what it looks like:

Can that brain be naturally, without any effort, fully awake? To find that out one must reject totally all experiences, except the experiences, physical experiences, psychological experiences must be totally rejected. And so not depend, not depend on pressures, impressions, stimulations. You are being now, by the speaker, stimulated, unfortunately. He will act as a drug, like coffee, tea or stronger drugs, alcohol and so on. If one depends on these things as a stimulant to keep the brain alert, then you are merely sustaining the mechanical process. And the brain has become for most of us mechanical, repetitive.

So to live a life without a single challenge, which doesn't mean it goes to sleep, without a single demand, both outwardly or inwardly so that the brain is extraordinarily active. Action is not movement. I wonder if you see this? May I go into it a little bit? Interested in it?

Action is not movement. Movement implies time - right? To go from here to there and so on. Any kind of movement is in the realm of time and thought - right? All movement, both physical and psychological, all thought is contained in the field of time. Right? And action is not of time. Action is not having done and the remembrance of the things that have been done, or experience or problems solved, which is all the background which is time, or the future is also time. Therefore action is instant, the very living of it immediate, instant. Are we conveying something?

So we are talking over together the question of a brain that has been so spoilt, so shocked, so wounded. Any shock is a wound, or any hurt. To have such a brain which is not capable of being hurt, psychologically, you may receive a shock when you fall down the staircase, that is a different matter, I hope you won't fall down the staircase. But the shock that one receives over bad news, or suddenly the doctor says, 'Old chap you have got cancer'. Or the shock of someone leaving you. All those kinds of shocks, wounding naturally the brain so that it is constantly in a strain. But to have a mind which is untouchable by circumstances - you understand? Such a brain is something extraordinary. That's part of meditation, not all the silly stuff that is going on.

So we have asked: is there a question which would answer all questions, only one question. We have answered it. Right?",1,1741247213.0,Krishnamurti,0,1.0,False

Well I was hired for a rebuild of an old store. So I was trained at another store while the my Sheetz was being rebuilt. 


So needless to say I was trained with a ton of people on the clock since there were 2 stores combined. So, by the time I left that store there were things I never learned bc other people would do those things. For example, I had no idea the rte dates were to be checked at midnight. Why? Bc the store I trained at did them at different times of the night and one specific person did them bc they were picky about it. 🙃 So of course I felt stupid when I get to the new store and I'm told they're supposed to be done at a certain time. 🫠🫠 I feel stupid alot bc of stuff I was never taught or told. Not a fan of that. The communication absolutely sucks!

Another thing that frustrates me, is how the hell am I supposed to get bathrooms done? Wash the fizz city trays, fob trays and coffee trays in the sink? All the while I'm told I can't leave the front bc I'm the only one up front???? Can't ask for help bc the 2 other people are drowning in the kitchen. So not sure how to navigate this. 

And lastly, I freaking loathe asking our MOD any type of question bc she never knows the answer, she throws her hands up and huffs and puffs says idk and walks off, seems to have an attitude everytime I ask anything. I really do try to figure stuff out on my own without her help but sometimes I do need her help with the register or something (I have been trained mainly in the kitchen and not the register). It's just incredibly stressful talking to her. 


Oh and I hate the new store layout. The customers love it. I do not. Not sure if it will grow on me or what. And the fact that the kitchen has to do drive-through now, is insane. Why in the world would sheetz think 3rd shift should only have 3 people, is beyond me.

I've had the strongest long covid symptoms since May 24, at least that's when I really realized something was wrong with me.

In June 24 I ate a kebab and it triggered something in my body...that night I thought I was going to die....it wasn't food poisoning.
I'm also struggling with sibo and before that my bowel movements had changed since I got corona for the third time, but the actual infection was in October 23.

When I went to my sister's in October 24, strangely enough I wasn't as bad as I am now, I lay there in the sun and later drank a coffee, I knew at the time that something was strange with my body, but I couldn't draw any conclusions that it was long covid, because I always thought that you cough a lot etc.

Anyway, on with the story, half an hour later after I had drunk the coffee and enjoyed the autumn sun we decided to go to the pharmacy together to get a blood sugar test.because we still didn't know what was going on.

When we had been sitting in the car for 10 minutes, I was overcome with goose bumps, not in a bad way but as if someone had put my soul back into my body...I was clear-headed, felt euphoric, was hungry, no pots symptoms, healthy complexion....

It was literally as if someone had flicked a switch in my head.
I felt hungry again,not a single feeling of impending doom or dysautonomy,no fight or flight,no dizziness,NOTHING!

We even went shopping afterwards and bought things to barbecue and had a lovely evening,we really thought that was it now,the coffee and sunshine cured me....

The next morning I woke up in my bed and all the symptoms were back and they have worsened to this day.... I have been chasing this feeling of normality since that day

Thank you for reading 🍀❤️ I hope we can heal and I'm sending prayers to everyone who's suffering with this hell of a disease!
🙏

Edit :
The strongest symptoms I have are as if my body is afraid, but I can do absolutely nothing about it, it's not me who is afraid but my body, as if my vagus nerve is not working properly, or the autonomic nervous system is not working properly.... Maybe it's also a bit like I'm missing a neurotransmitter in my head that triggers inner security.

At the time when I felt better for a few hours, the symptoms were almost gone...maybe everything was still there but at most 10% of its intensity.

Like the clouds covering the bright shine

I see your faded smile

It's pleasantly hurting

It's fair and unfair

For I know you so bare

For remembering so deep I pay

They say it gets better day by day



My loss so deep I am confused of how
should I feel

Should I be angry at you for walking out on our deal

Or rather to be happy that you are not
hurting anymore

Waking up and hoping to find you beside me

I am crazy for you, let me be

Lol,"Birthday ko recently , ginawa ko for this year before ng bday ko inoff ko yung notif na bday reminder sa FB at Snapchat, lol para makita ko kung sino talaga nakakaalala hindi yung porket nakita lang at naremind iba pa din kase na talagang alam nila o naalala nila e. For me naman  I do understand for iba kong friends na baka busy sa work or personal life o baka may pinagdadaanan, pero karamihan that day nakakausap and chat ko and walang bati so means hindi talaga nila naalala, mababaw man sa tingin ng iba para saken kinda sad kase ako alam ko birthday nila at naalala ko sila minsan may konti pang effort like cake or gifts, nakakasad lang na laging ako lang yung ganto pero walang balik from them? Ewan not that I’m going to avoid or cut them off pero siguro It’s a sign for me to do less for people na hindi nakakaalala at nandyan lang pag may need sila sa akin. So thankful for the peeps and friends na bumati saken kahit may late still na appreciate ko yun.  Mas nakakashock lang sakin na yung isang friend group ko for almost 10 years 2 lang nakaalala, sabagay dun sa friend group na yun karamihan parang nagpapasabit lang para makalibre ng foods or coffee. Tapos yung hindi ko aakalain na makakaalala sila Pa yung nakaalala. Mukang mali yung ineefortan kong friendship now I know kung san dapat.

me and my boyfriend (f19,m19) both work full time and go to school full time. i work in the medical field and he works at a coffee shop. we have been together for a year and a half. 

i work 4 12+ hour shifts a week and go to school / do school work on my days off. i go into work at 6:30am and usually leave around 8:00pm, i am on my feet all day. i really only have time to eat shower sleep and repeat the same work routine. if i dont work, i spend my days studying or in class. i try to balance my life out and work on my relationship with my boyfriend. even though i dont see him often, i always text and call to make sure he feels secure and knows that i am thinking about him. 

on the other hand, he works 5 5 hour shifts a week , goes to school M-F for only 2 hours , works right after and has the rest of the day for himself (school 8am-10am , works 10am-4pm) + weekends off. i know he is a hard worker and he prioritizes his school over me , which i understand i want him to pursue what makes him happy. but he doesn’t text me, he doesn’t call me, he makes excuses whenever i push back on him about this. 

he has so much free time, but instead of him wanting to send me a message or see me, he spends his time napping or scrolling tiktok while im waiting for a reply? i hate to feel this way but is taking a nap more important than me? when i leave work, he never asks me to go and get food with him, he doesn’t offer to bring me something to drink from his work, he doesn’t check up on me …. why do i feel like he just doesn’t want me ? maybe i need a guys perspective but what do i do about this? do i just stop pushing so much about this and see if he does it on his own ? 

i guess i just want him to reach out on his own. he knows what makes me happy, he knows i want to feel appreciated….. ive repeated myself so many times and im starting to feel like if he wanted to make me feel that i am important to at least check up on … he would. (i probably am answering my own question lol)

I’m native to this area but finding it really hard to make friends in adulthood. Most people I’m the town where I live here are 40s/50s+ with kids and established lives, and don’t seem to be looking to make new friends.

I like to hike, go for walks, drink tea/coffee, meditate (I go to events at Spirit Rock whenever I have time, but that’s only around once a month and most people are 60+), love dogs (but don’t have one), cats, all animals, swim (I’m not very good, but it’s great exercise), hang out and talk/chat, read (although I don’t have a ton of time for new books due to my studies), etc. Due to physical limitations, I do not run, go to the gym, lift weights, practice yoga, or bike ride…which seems to be what most people here do. I go to coffee shops and the library, but people there generally tend to be with their families or not looking to meet anyone new.

I’ve lived in a lot of different areas (including outside the US) and in my perspective, the culture here is not the friendliest. People are generally polite yet keep to themselves, and there’s an underlying aura of elitism/entitlement here (and varying levels of subtle racism, if we’re being honest). I am not ageist; I am happy to make friends with anyone ages 20-90, but it would be great to meet some like-minded people in their late 20s-40s, ideally without kids, or who have lives outside of their family life. This isn’t meant to discriminate against anyone, just want to find some people who are in a similar phase of life I can connect with and relate to.

I plan to join a hiking meetup group and go a couple times a month and continue going to spirit rock for meditation events. Besides that, I’m out of ideas. Any tips on where to go/what to do to make new friends? ",6,1741246314.0,Marin,15,1.0,False
1j4q70c,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1j4q70c/blueprint_to_get_your_life_back_on_track_in_less/,BLUEPRINT TO GET YOUR LIFE BACK ON TRACK - IN LESS THAN 60 DAYS,"**Three Levels** \- **Basic, Level 2, Level 3**. Once you move from Basic to Level 2, you continue doing everything from Basic Level AS WELL AS the new activities of Level 2. Similarly, from Level 2 to Level 3, you continue all your Basic + Level 2 activities including new activities of Level 3.

# Start with the basics: SLEEP, DIET, EXERCISE // 2-3 weeks // Driving Factor: MOTIVATION

**1. Sleep at 10-11 PM**  
(won't be possible the first night. I usually stay up a whole 24+ Hours so that I'm crashed out by 10PM on the night that I want to restart my life).

**2. Wake up at 5-6 AM**  
(will be hard the first three day. Post the three-day threshold, you will wake up without an alarm on most days. Make your bed immediately after waking up)

**3. Workout 45minutes to 1 hour**  
(Any workout - it can be the gym, sports clubs, martial arts classes, walking/running, home workouts - one hour of working the shxt out of your body)

**4. Quit junk food** from Monday to Saturday. Eat a cheat meal or two on Sunday. 

**5. Quitting alcohol/smoking/substances** cold-turkey is hard. Avoidance is a way to start on a journey of control. (Can try the Avoid Monday-Saturday, drink moderately on Saturday night and use Sunday to re-coup.  
For smoking, I am a non-smoker so cannot offer much helpful tips except maybe drop the number of cigarettes you smoke through per day)

**6. Quit porn**  
(I don't watch porn at all so, again, no helpful tips except read up the list of the negative impacts it has on your physical, mental and sexual health and, like, don't do it)

**7. Quit social media**  
(My life was hell when I had social media. I cannot stress enough how happy, contented, grateful and peaceful my life has become after I deleted Instagram for real, uninstalled Youtube off my phone, and also stopped instant messaging like Whatsapp for a few months when I had hit rock bottom. This is one thing you can and should quit cold turkey.)

# Level 2: ROUTINES, WORK, RELAX // 2-3 weeks //                Driving Factor - ALT DOPAMINE = PRODUCTIVITY DOPAMINE

**1. Set a routine**  
(Biggest mistake would be to aim for perfection. Don't make routines that look like the timestamps of a Youtube video. Just a general, loose overview of your day. Make slots for activities. Maybe three 2-hour slots for work during the entire day, one 1-hour slot for workout, 1 2-hour slot for cooking etc)

**2. Don't abandon the routine when you do not follow it for one-quarter of a day**  
(suppose you woke up later than 5, say 7 AM. Start off with your day as it would look like at 7 AM. Pick up where you left off. If not Carpe Diem, at least Carpe half-the-Diem).

**3. Morning Routine**  
(Do NOT follow ""aesthetic morning routine"" videos. They're so complicated, they're almost counterproductive. Mine goes like:   
Freshen up --> Guided Meditation 10 minutes --> Coffee+sunlight+happytunes --> Fruit + plan day --> Work

**4. Night Routine**  
(Again, nothing too fancy. I try to end my day doing something non-work, non-screen, non-eat. Like, stop work, probably scroll a bit then shut off screens for the day.   
Then, clean and organize my home --> sip on hot cocoa while read/journal/sketch/slow playlist --> brush teeth, wash up  --> change into PJs --> to bed

**5. Work**  
(Now that the basics are in place, take work seriously. Pomodoro 50-10, 2H-30m, 3H-1H - whatever works for your capabilities and work requirements. I use pomodoro because I have to study. If you have a job, that will count as work hours and other pointers in the list can be adjusted according to work hours)

**6. Relax**   
(Please find time to love and care for yourself. Some activity, some hobby, that helps you unwind ad de-stimulate. Some use gaming to de-stress but as a non-gamer, I look at it as a stimulant or emotional numb-er instead of unwind and relax. I often make myself a hot beverage or a mocktail and clean/organize, play the ukulele, journal, etc)

# Level 3: SOCIALIZATION, REWARD SYSTEM // 2 weeks //     Driving Factor - WILL TO LIVE, LOOK FORWARD TO LIFE

**1. Avenues for socialization - if you do not have friends**  
(Clubs for people with similar interests - running clubs, book clubs, craft clubs, sports clubs / Volunteering at hospitals, orphanages, animal shelters / Mixer events for singles / Entertainment events - Stand-up comedy, Open-mics, Live concert, Food festivals / Participate as a volunteer or intern organizing committees of public events in the city)

**2. Socialization - if you have friends**   
(Take friend(s) along to any or all of the above events / Call up old friends of the past / Catch up with old/regular friends over a meal / Board game night at home with friends / Head to the mall/arcade/bowling/a game of badminton or squash, swimming / Movie night at home or at the cinema-hall / plain old coffee and catch up)

**3. Avoid triggers**  
(Did you struggle with a drinking addiction? Avoid socializing over drinks or at clubs. Avoid people that bring out the worst in you - communicate or don't hangout at all. Avoid people that you know will drag you back to square one with their backhanded comments, pointless venting, bitching behind others' backs, dismissing your new lifestyle. There's time to be strong and stoic - and now is not that time)

**4. Rewards**  
(Now that you've spent at least a month working on yourself as best as you can, start celebrating your wins. Small wins - mini celebrations. Big wins - big celebrations.)

**This is the blueprint** that I more or less used to pull myself up from rock bottom. I am still not at my top game, but I will soon be. 

***Please remember, work towards perfection, not for perfection***. try doing things as well as possible. You will not be at 100% everyday. Somedays, you will be at a 30%. Make that an honest 30%. Make that 30% count just like you will make the 100% count. 

***One mistake I made in my journey was stopping living life while working for my goals.*** While doing so, two years have passed and no memories have been made. Dont do that. The negative, counterproductive, instant-gratification aspects of life should stop, no doubt. But do not stop living and loving life at present while working towards a better future.",9,1741246271.0,GetStudying,2,0.91,False

M/F Consensual, Slavery, Bondage, Humiliation. Part 3. Jenner Awkwardly Confesses To Dolores He's Depressed Because Of Her And Ben's New Closeness, Dolores Persuades Ben To Share Her, The Boys Double Team Dolores.","Dolores's  Perspective

It has been a steamy two weeks, we wrapped our first shoot, and my son and I have been humping like bunnies. He did try to be a gentleman and not insist on sex outside of shooting. That was all my dirty idea, and my boy still wants to make his mom happy. I loved spending long, steamy nights being fucked by my hot, studly son all over the house in various positions. Oral, anal, vaginal, what my baby wanted I proudly gave him. Sleeping in his bed, getting up to cook him breakfast. Having a morning quickie, me bent over the sofa. Then seeing him off to work on the day the towing business was busy with a long, lingering tongue heavy kiss. I usually kissed him goodbye on the porch, but sometimes our making out got so intense I had to pull him inside so the neighbors wouldn't talk about us.

It was so wrong, and it couldn't last. More than ever, I realized I'd been holding him back in life. He needed to find a nice girl, settle down, and make a family of his own. It's not like I was going to be around forever.

But if the hot, steamy sex with my son was wrong (But, oooooh, it felt sooooo right) it kickstarted the healing process between us, and I hope that remained when we went back to a normal mother-son relationship. Mark's death had left a big ugly scar between us that scabbed over without really healing. Our taboo intimacy seemed to unlock the warm relationship we enjoyed from before. Snuggling on the couch after a marathon sex session, him laughing at my crazy Navy sea stories. When he couldn't sleep in the wee hours of the morning, me singing lullabies to him in Tagalog, stroking his hair until he drifted off clutching me tightly. Giggling at the dinner table about memories of life as  a Military Family living off base. I'd been neglecting my poor baby for so long, when he'd been hurting just as bad as I was. I'm glad I could fulfill his needs now, even the ones a mother shouldn't be fulfilling. Even if my little Pinay slut self was enjoying fulfilling them, for the moment.

Today I was vacuuming the carpet, wearing nothing but a pink, body length apron that read ""Master's MILF Slut"" in red letters across the front. It was Ben's favorite sexy outfit for me to wear around the house. Easy access to hot mommy pussy for that dirty boy. When I wore this I had to make sure dinner was warm in the oven for my hard working  young man. He usually liked to bang me like a cheap Manila hooker before he ate. That's why it's  my favorite outfit, too.

My vag tingles with excitement when the doorbell rings. It isn't even noon yet! My dirty little boy just can't keep his hands off me. Or his dick out of me. I giggle at the thought. That's my boy! I think proudly.

I strut sexily to the door and open it. ""Hey, stud, ready for an afternoon quickie...."" I stop when I see it's not my Ben. This boy is thinner, if still fit. Brown instead of black hair, mustache instead of clean shaven. An expensive custom suit that still manages to look ill fitting and cheap. Staring down my apron at my brown breasts.  At least I'm pretty sure he's not admiring my tattooed Eagle. Jenner.

The boy fucks pretty good, I'll give him that from when him and Ben DP'd me for the shoot. But he's just so annoyingly awkward around women when he's not shooting porn or getting one off hook-ups. I really want to ask him what the fuck he wants, rudely enough to make him leave. But I'm playing submissive Pinay housegirl. And this kid's business proposition inadvertently is the cause of my joyous, sensual new relationship with Ben. And he's my son's best friend.

I put on my sweetest smile. ""Master Jenner, Sir, what a pleasant suprise. What can I do for you?"" His eyes jerk up guiltily from my tits to my face. ""Uh, hi, uh Miss Cruz, sweetheart."" He moves to kiss my lips and I quickly turn so he catches my right cheek instead. He pulls back awkwardly and stares.

""Sir, what can I do for you?"" He seems to snap out of a fugue. ""Uh, is Ben here? I wanted to discuss some scenes for the next Cougar Tamers with him? Uhm, you can sit in, too of course, since it involves you too, Miss Cruz.""  Alarm bells go off in my mind. This isn't 1990, he could easily call or text to see if Ben's home. What does he really want? Still, a submissive Filipina housegirl doesn't question a man, especially her son's best pal.

""I'm sorry, Sir, he's out on the road for business today."" I think of casually closing the door in his face. I'm pretty sure he's nervous enough around women outside porn sets and hotel rooms that he wouldn't stop me. Sigh. Pinay House Girls don't treat men like that, even annoying little creeps.

Big, fake smile. ""Would you like to come in for coffee, Sir?"" He looks kind of suprised I'm still being nice to him. ""Um, uh sure, thanks, Miss Cruz!"" I step aside to let him in. ""Please take off your shoes, and put them on the mat to your left, Sir."" I close the door as he steps in and complies.

I resign myself to him staring at my brown ass as he follows me to the kitchen. Why does it bother me so much? There's now video all over the internet of him fucking me in every hole, just like my son. But where Ben staring at my ass would get me hot, this boy's gaze makes my skin crawl.

I gesture for him to sit at the dining room table. Of course, he follows me into the kitchen. Sigh. I change the coffee grounds in the coffee maker, then start it up.

""You, uh, really keep house good, Miss Cruz. Everything's so neat and clean."" It is a nice compliment. ""Why, thank you, sir. Most of that is Ben's doing. He insisted I start pulling my weight around the house when...we accepted your...business proposition."" He replies ""Still, he's a lucky man to have you. Pretty, keeps house well, and he tells me you have a great sense of humor, too."" He sounds wistful.

I feel bad for judging him so harshly. I'd been so wrapped up in my new happy, if taboo, relationship with my sexy boy that I lost empathy for other people. Jenner seemed like a nice boy with good business sense. Just awkward and lonely in social interactions outside of porn sets and hookups. 

A hand fell on my right shoulder, while another one wrapped around my waist. I didn't even think, just slammed my elbow back into his gut until I heard an ""ooof"" as my assailant stumbles back.  I turn around bringing my hands up for a three punch combo to finish him off. The pathetic sight of him cowering with his arms up stops me.

""Please, Miss Cruz, I'm sorry! You're just so beautiful, and...you make him so happy...I just thought..."" I bark at him ""What the fuck boy, our home isn't one of your porn shoots! Who do you think you are, coming in here and putting your hands on me!"" I glare at him.

""I know, you're right. I'll go, I-please don't tell Ben."" He still seems to be hunched over from my elbow strike. I let out a deep breath and most of my anger. l really don't think he was planning to rape me, just making an awkward move. I proved I can still handle myself, he's no threat to me.
I walk up to him, grab him by the arm and drag him to the couch, gently helping him sit. ""You okay, Jenner? Need some ice, or aspirin?"" He wheezes but straightens. ""No, I'm fine, Miss Cruz, I swear I wasn't going to hurt you or make you do something you didn't want to. I gotta go."" He starts to stand, I shove him down.

""Young man, you're going to sit right there and let me bring you your coffee. We're going to talk, obviously you need someone to listen to you. If you leave now, I will tell Ben. If you tell me what's bothering you, this will be our secret. Cream and sugar, dear?"" My smile is back.

He answers with a wan one of his own. ""Two teaspoons and Hazelnut if you have it. You know, I always envied him having you growing up. My parents were never there. But you always had milk, cookies and a big, pretty smile for us when I came over to visit with him. It sounds awful now, but I felt a little satisfaction with how estranged you and him were for awhile, like he was learning how I felt growing up. Then being a porn couple suprisingly brings you two close again. He's really happy to have his mom back, Miss Cruz. I'm very happy for both of you. I guess I just wish there was room for me.""

I suddenly feel bad for this poor, lonely boy as I pat his hand and go to fetch the coffee. An idea was taking shape. Why couldn't we make room for him? We owe him for this miraculous healing of our bond. He's already fucked me, why not adopt him into our lascivious little family?

I prepare our coffees and see a bag of Soft Batch cookies, deciding to plate some of them and put them on a tray.
When I bring them out he actually gives me a rather nice smile. ""Still the sweetest soccer mom in the neighborhood. And the hottest!"" I'm glad for my dark skin, thinking I'm probably flushing a little from his sincere compliment.

He opens up suprisingly quick while sipping coffee. He grew up a loner, his Dad was a toss pot  alkie, who couldn't hold a job, in and out of their lives for sometimes months at a time. His mom had to work hard to pick up the slack. He was the odd kid out getting picked on for his thrift store clothes and being poor, always fighting and skipping school.

Then he met my Ben. Muscular, popular, athletic, theirs was an unlikely friendship. But obviously an enduring one. I just remember him as that rat face little buddy of my handsome son. Couldn't imagine how they were friends, though I was always nice to him when Ben brought him over. Yeah, a lot of my old sins are starting to come back to haunt me lately. I taught Ben not to be dismissive of people based on appearances.  But that's exactly what I did to this poor, sad young man, while Ben took my lessons to heart.

He said he found me attractive, like every other boy Ben brought over. But he was more intrigued by how close our relationship was, and envious of Ben for having a mom that wasn't just pretty, but so caring and attentive. He said he wished I was his mom more than he ever wanted to fuck me. Again, I'm glad for my dark skin, positive I'm flushing this time.
""After-his dad, your husband passed, and you two started growing distant, it was obvious how sad and hurt he was.  I'm ashamed a small, mean part of me enjoyed him learning how it feels not to have a Dad, and a Mom for who you're an afterthought. He wanted to punish you when he blackmailed you with that scam you were pulling on the VA."" I give him a sour look.

""I'm sorry, Miss Cruz, but you're an intelligent woman, I think you can guess he told me everything. He wanted to make you work a menial job. But I thought of Cougar Tamers, having studly young men dom their sexy submissive MILF girlfriends on cam. You two seemed like the perfect couple for it. I'm helping my bro out, and get a poke at his sexy mom, win-win deal, right?"" He looks down, a little ashamed.

I pat his knee and give him a reassuring smile. He looks up suprised but continues. ""But I never expected the effect it had on both of you. You seemed like a soul dead harpy the last few years. But a week around you two on set and you're just glowing with vitality. I knew you two had chemistry, but...wow. You two constantly trading looks  with each other and making out when we're not shooting. The time  I caught you two fucking in that gym's showers. Not just sex, but the way you two giggle and laugh together on breaks, like the last two years never happened. I'm happy for both of you. But I'm on the outside looking in again."" He looks glumly into his coffee.

He's shocked when I take his free left hand and put it up to the American Eagle tattooed on my chest. ""So, I noticed you admiring my ink work earlier, do you like my Eagle?"" Both of us knowing perfectly well was not my tattoo he was admiring. ""Actually, this is good work. I did seriously want to talk to Ben about getting you more tattoos...you're a sexy woman who'd make them look good.""

""Jenner, you should have came to talk to both of us earlier. Why don't you stay for dinner when Ben gets home...we have a lot to talk about. We owe a lot of our current happiness to you. No reason we can't share it with you."" 

He gets a big boyish smile as he traces my Eagle. ""Really?"" I smile dazzlingly back. ""Really."" He looks so delighted and amazed.
Just then the door comes open. Ben's booming voice ""Hey, Shortstack, Daddy's home! I couldn't get rid of this wood, so I thought I'd stick it in your cute little brown butt. Bend over you sexy little jungle Asian-""

His voice trails off when he sees us on the couch together. It admittedly doesn't look good, Jenner with his hand on my chest, which he quickly removes. 

""What is going on here? Jenner, why are you touching my mom? Shortstack, are you okay? Did this bastard try to make you-"" I cut him off. ""Ben, I'm fine. He's been a perfect gentleman.""  Well, not exactly perfect, but not fanning the flames of my boy's obvious anger. ""We need to talk, all three of us. But first I want a word with you in private; son.""

""Miss Cruz, Ben I think I better go-"" I put on my sternest ""Mom Voice"" as I stand up. ""You're going to sit and finish your coffee and cookies, young man!"" I command. ""While I have a word with my son."" He put his coffee down and somberly started munching a cookie, not making eye contact with either of us.

""Shortstack-"" Ben started. Still with my ""Mom Voice"" on, 
I turn to Ben. ""Don't ""Shortstack"" me right now, boy. We need to talk, in Mark's study, right now."" He blinks, so used to me being submissive it takes a moment for my maternal command to sink in. But he remembers I was his mom way before I was his sub, and quietly turns to head for the study.

I turn to Jenner. ""You better be here when we get back, young man. Or I'll break out my bamboo cane and give you a spanking."" He looks up with a little smile. ""I might enjoy that, Miss Cruz."" I reply ""I bet, you dirty boy.""  with a small grin. Then I turn to head to the study.

I get there to him looking at Mark's chair behind the desk, not sitting down. I feel a thrill, this is where he first took charge and tamed my pinay mommy butt. I wish we could have a quickie, me bent over the desk, hands tied behind my...

Later. I say  ""Boy, you going to stand there staring at it all day? Ben, take your seat as head of household."" I gesture to Mark's chair. He sits and I pull up a rolling chair on the other side. The same one he pushed me into when he first made me his captive. Oooh. Stow it, slut. The boy who made this wonderful new life possible needs your help. I look at my son and make my carefully edited pitch for Jenner.

I just told Ben he came over because he was feeling lonely, told me about his past, and opened up about how sad our newfound closeness made him feel, though he was happy for us personally. 
Mark nods along, I'm sure he knows about Jenner's past, and is not shocked
 by his friend's current feelings.

""Let me guess, mom. You want to adopt him and have him here more often so he'll feel more included."" I can't read his neutral tone.

""Son, he brought us back together, closer than ever before."" We share lewd leers, oh how...close. ""I always taught you to share, and you have with him on camera. Why can't we let him in on it off set, he deserves it?""

""You lewd little thing. You're just hungry for more young, big white cock."" He gets up from around the chair and moves around the desk to me. I stay seated as he roughly jerks my apron down and starts fondling my breasts. I lick his delicious male bulge through his polyester trousers, moaning. Then I smile my most pretty, submissive smile up at him. ""You know me so well, my sexy boy. Please...can we keep him...Daddy?""

He pets my head gently. ""How can I say no to that pretty brown face?"" He helps me to my feet. ""You're right, mom. We owe him big, not just for the money, but for healing our rift after Dad died. Let's go talk to him. Leave your apron down, tie it off under your breasts."" My boy, back in charge again. I love it! I eagerly obey his command as we go downstairs to talk to his friend.

He looks up nervously and puts down the coffee he was sipping when we approach him. His eyes widen at my bare breasts, though the silly boy's seen them, and more, before.

""Bro, great of you to stop by, and look in on my Shortstack. I worry about her sometimes, such a small, sexy little thing all alone while I'm at work. Shortstack, where are your manners?!! My bro looks tense, give him a massage, you little slacker! Trust me bro, Philippinas give great massages.""

I enthsiastically reply ""Yes, Master Ben!"" I sit down to his homie's left, urging him to face Ben as he sits to his friend's right. I start rubbing his back and shoulders.

""So, look I was thinking. Since you were nice enough to check up on her for me today, maybe, if you have the time, you could do it more often? She's a good girl, but she still needs some male guidance when I'm not around. Someone to make sure she gets her chores done, doesn't burn dinner, and just be the Master she needs when I can't be there for her. Shortstack would really like that, and she'd reward you, generously. Wouldn't you, Shortstack?""

""I would, Master Ben. Reward you. Generously, Master Jenner."" I whisper sensously in his right ear as I rub my nipples against his suit coat back. He tries to stifle an excited groan.

""So, how bout it bro? When we're not shooting, and you have time, we know you're a busy man. But it means a lot if you can make the time to take care of Shorty for me. You of all people know how special she is to me."" I give my son a fond, motherly smile over Jenner's shoulder at the sincerity in his tone at that last sentence.

""Uh, well I could uh, make some time to check on her...even when we are shooting.""
My boy  slaps his friend's left shoulder. ""Great, I knew I could count on you, bro. So, speaking of Shorty, I was about to throw a fuck into her. Want to stay and help me? Two white studs like us will have the little brown slut begging for mercy.""
I press my breasts against Jenner's back as I whisper teasingly in his ear. ""Ooooh, two big strong white boys, fucking little ol'me. Mercy, Masters, please, MERCY!"" I give a feminine giggle in his ear.

""I am uh, not sure, got some paperwork to-"" Ben cuts him off. ""Shorty will suck your dick really good, it's what Pinay girls do. Show him Short Stuff."" I lean back and stick my right index finger in my pussy, then in my mouth. I'm glad at how easy it is to jerk the apron up for easy access. I suck my finger and moan around it, maintaining sultry eye contact with the rapt young man.

I glance at his bulge and slide on my stomach until my head is over is fly, which is bulging. I giggle again, he's a bit of a scrawny boy, but he has a nice, big, white....

I unzip him, then with his help pull his pants to mid-thigh. I bite down his jockey shorts down with a sensual growl. Then my mouth is sliding down that sensual white meat pole, slurping and gagging as he moans.

I feel my boy come around behind me. I don't resist as he forces my hands palm to palm behind my back. I suck harder, so turned on when I feel him slip the padded zip cuffs around my wrists and cinch them tight. Servicing two horny boys tied up, every middle aged slut's dream...

A few hours later

Two horny young Masters fucking my little submissive Filipina ass all over the house is fun. But exhausting, I'm bruised where those two little fucks power slammed me into the furniture while humping me like crazed pit bulls. Still I loved it. Two boys to take care of. and two boys to take care of me. I'm in whore nirvana.

Right now I'm sleeping on the couch, face down on a pillow my head turned to the right. Dreaming of lying on a beach somewhere, sun bathing nude while my sexy boy lathers sun block on my back. Yes, brown people can still burn if the sun is hot enough.

I wake to a start to see Jenner crouched by the couch, holding up a bottle of water with a straw in it.  ""Sorry to wake you, Miss Cruz, thought you might be thirsty."" Actually I'm parched, my mouth catches the straw and sucks harder then I sucked his dick earlier. When I'm satisfied, I smile and say ""Thanks, hon, you're a sweet boy.""

He looks at me with an adoring look, so intense I'm surprised. ""Thank you, so much."" His gratitude takes me aback.

""For what?"" He smiles knowingly. ""I know it was you who talked him into sharing you...or persuaded him some other way. I don't care how you did it. Thank you.""

I lean forward to kiss his cheek. ""No thanks needed. Consider yourself adopted. I have two sons now. And knock off that Miss Cruz nonsense, I'm Dolores or Slave to you from now on. I'd let you call me Shortstack, but it's kind of Ben's special name for me, you'll have to get his permission. Welcome to the family, Master Jenner.""

He kisses my forehead. ""Thanks, Miss Cr-Dolores."" I tug at my still bound hands. ""Speaking of having two boys, could you or Master Ben untie me? I think it's getting to be dinner time, and I want to make a good meal for my two men.""

""Relax, Sweetheart. Ben's orders are for you to relax. He said don't worry your pretty little head, he's got dinner covered. He wants to celebrate our new arrangement. You hush now, we'll untie you when everything is ready.""

I start to lift my head to ask more questions, he gently but firmly presses my head back down on the pillow with a finger to his lips. ""Yes, Master Jenner."" I aquiesce obediently.

Tell me three weeks ago I'd love being dommed by my sexy son and his awkward friend, I'd say you were a loony. Now I'd say you're a psychic.

Once you move from Basic to Level 2, you continue doing everything from Basic Level AS WELL AS the new activities of Level 2. Similarly, from Level 2 to Level 3, you continue all your Basic + Level 2 activities including new activities of Level 3.

# Start with the basics: SLEEP, DIET, EXERCISE // 2-3 weeks // Driving Factor: MOTIVATION

**1. Sleep at 10-11 PM**  
(won't be possible the first night. I usually stay up a whole 24+ Hours so that I'm crashed out by 10PM on the night that I want to restart my life).

**2. Wake up at 5-6 AM**  
(will be hard the first three day. Post the three-day threshold, you will wake up without an alarm on most days. Make your bed immediately after waking up)

**3. Workout 45minutes to 1 hour**  
(Any workout - it can be the gym, sports clubs, martial arts classes, walking/running, home workouts - one hour of working the shxt out of your body)

**4. Quit junk food** from Monday to Saturday. Eat a cheat meal or two on Sunday. 

**5. Quitting alcohol/smoking/substances** cold-turkey is hard. Avoidance is a way to start on a journey of control. (Can try the Avoid Monday-Saturday, drink moderately on Saturday night and use Sunday to re-coup.  
For smoking, I am a non-smoker so cannot offer much helpful tips except maybe drop the number of cigarettes you smoke through per day)

**6. Quit porn**  
(I don't watch porn at all so, again, no helpful tips except read up the list of the negative impacts it has on your physical, mental and sexual health and, like, don't do it)

**7. Quit social media**  
(My life was hell when I had social media. I cannot stress enough how happy, contented, grateful and peaceful my life has become after I deleted Instagram for real, uninstalled Youtube off my phone, and also stopped instant messaging like Whatsapp for a few months when I had hit rock bottom. This is one thing you can and should quit cold turkey.)

# Level 2: ROUTINES, WORK, RELAX // 2-3 weeks //                Driving Factor - ALT DOPAMINE = PRODUCTIVITY DOPAMINE

**1. Set a routine**  
(Biggest mistake would be to aim for perfection. Don't make routines that look like the timestamps of a Youtube video. Just a general, loose overview of your day. Make slots for activities. Maybe three 2-hour slots for work during the entire day, one 1-hour slot for workout, 1 2-hour slot for cooking etc)

**2. Don't abandon the routine when you do not follow it for one-quarter of a day**  
(suppose you woke up later than 5, say 7 AM. Start off with your day as it would look like at 7 AM. Pick up where you left off. If not Carpe Diem, at least Carpe half-the-Diem).

**3. Morning Routine**  
(Do NOT follow ""aesthetic morning routine"" videos. They're so complicated, they're almost counterproductive. Mine goes like:   
Freshen up --> Guided Meditation 10 minutes --> Coffee+sunlight+happymusic --> Fruit + plan day --> Work

**4. Night Routine**  
(Again, nothing too fancy. I try to end my day doing something non-work, non-screen, non-eat. Like, stop work, probably scroll a bit then shut off screens for the day.   
Then, clean and organize my home --> sip on hot cocoa while read/journal/sketch/slow music --> brush teeth, wash up  --> change into PJs --> to bed

**5. Work**  
(Now that the basics are in place, take work seriously. Pomodoro 50-10, 2H-30m, 3H-1H - whatever works for your capabilities and work requirements. I use pomodoro because I have to study. If you have a job, that will count as work hours and other pointers in the list can be adjusted according to work hours)

**6. Relax**   
(Please find time to love and care for yourself. Some activity, some hobby, that helps you unwind ad de-stimulate. Some use gaming to de-stress but as a non-gamer, I look at it as a stimulant or emotional numb-er instead of unwind and relax. I often make myself a hot beverage or a mocktail and clean/organize, listen to music, play the ukulele, journal, etc)

# Level 3: SOCIALIZATION, REWARD SYSTEM // 2 weeks //     Driving Factor - WILL TO LIVE, LOOK FORWARD TO LIFE

**1. Avenues for socialization - if you do not have friends**  
(Clubs for people with similar interests - running clubs, book clubs, craft clubs, sports clubs / Volunteering at hospitals, orphanages, animal shelters / Mixer events for singles / Entertainment events - Stand-up comedy, Open-mics, Live music, Food festivals / Participate as a volunteer or intern organizing committees of public events in the city)

**2. Socialization - if you have friends**   
(Take friend(s) along to any or all of the above events / Call up old friends of the past / Catch up with old/regular friends over a meal / Board game night at home with friends / Head to the mall/arcade/bowling/a game of badminton or squash, swimming / Movie night at home or at the cinema-hall / plain old coffee and catch up)

**3. Avoid triggers**  
(Did you struggle with a drinking addiction? Avoid socializing over drinks or at clubs. Avoid people that bring out the worst in you - communicate or don't hangout at all. Avoid people that you know will drag you back to square one with their backhanded comments, pointless venting, bitching behind others' backs, dismissing your new lifestyle. There's time to be strong and stoic - and now is not that time)

**4. Rewards**  
(Now that you've spent at least a month working on yourself as best as you can, start celebrating your wins. Small wins - mini celebrations. Big wins - big celebrations.)

**This is the blueprint** that I more or less used to pull myself up from rock bottom. I am still not at my top game, but I will soon be. 

***Please remember, work towards perfection, not for perfection***. try doing things as well as possible. You will not be at 100% everyday. Somedays, you will be at a 30%. Make that an honest 30%. Make that 30% count just like you will make the 100% count. 

***One mistake I made in my journey was stopping living life while working for my goals.*** While doing so, two years have passed and no memories have been made. Dont do that.

For maybe 2 months, consistent din siya na nandoon sa days that I am there kasi nasa same workout tier kami. Usually kasi kakain or magkakape after ng sessions so syempre nag-uusap. One time na nag coffee kami, sabi niya na ang tagal na daw niya naghahanap ng Ate figure sa friends niya so sobrang happy niya na nameet niya daw ako kasi parang ang dami ko daw advice sa kanya. Okay naman sa akin yun kasi she is younger and it's always nice to help or give people advice when asked.

After those 2 months though, she stopped going to the sessions kasi overall she didn't like the vibe of the rest of the group. We don't have anything in common other than that workout so syempre, yung friendship nag fizzle out - at least for me.

Nabigla ako last January when she msged me na she signed up for the same event I did, and wanted to meet up at the city the event was held. Eh andoon family ko so I declined and said I will not have time. On the day of the event, she called to update me na na-injury daw siya sa event, pero yun nga, I was hanging out with my fam. So I said sorry I'm out and I cannot take a call. Recently, pumunta siya sa session namin ulit, and sobrang touchy niya - hug, beso, tapos sabay hug ulit. Eh ako naman, in my head, parang, ""huh di na nga ako nagrereply sayo eh."" Pero I just smiled. And did nothing kasi nga ayoko naman maging rude.

Ayun. Baka iba lang kami ng gauge ng closeness pero ako kasi it takes me a loooong time to warm up to people. Kaya nabibigla ako sa mga tulad niya na ilang months palang na nagmeet/hangout, feeling super close na. Huhu. Hayaan ko nalang yun, baka tumigil na din eventually.

I’ve been on Lexapro 10mg for almost two years, and it has been the best antidepressant I’ve ever taken. It helped me feel stable, sleep better, and manage my PTSD and anxiety in a way that I never could before. I genuinely feel like it changed my life.

But over the past few months, I’ve gained a lot of weight—jumping from a size 8 to a 12/13, L to XL, and even my bra size went from 34B to 38B. The worst part is the extreme hunger spikes where I feel nauseous, dizzy, in panic mode, and like I haven’t eaten in years. The only way to make it stop is to eat quickly and in large amounts—bags of chips, candy, frozen foods, fast food, anything I can get my hands on.

It’s gotten so bad that I’ve had to stop studying at the library to run to McDonald’s and drown myself in food, or else I go into full panic mode—shaking, sweating, and feeling like I’m about to faint because I didn’t eat something like candy, chips, sweets, or french fries. The worst part is that I’m a nail technician, and sometimes this happens in the middle of a customer—I start feeling like I’m going to pass out, and I have to step away just to get something in my system.

I talked to my psychiatrist, and she said my blood sugar is dropping due to my increased appetite, likely from taking Lexapro before bed and not eating much in the morning. The thing is, I’ve never been a big breakfast person—just coffee and a muffin, and I was fine until lunch. Now, by lunchtime, I’m eating portions meant for two people.

I’ve tried eating healthier and going to the gym, but it’s not helping the fact that the hunger strikes are happening faster, and I feel constantly hungry no matter what I do.

I feel trapped because 10mg has been amazing for me, but I’m overweight at 5’5” and 180 lbs, and I know this will only get worse if I don’t do something. My psychiatrist suggested adding Wellbutrin to help with appetite suppression, but my therapist (who made it clear she’s not giving medical advice) mentioned that it feels unethical to just add another med to counteract Lexapro’s side effects instead of lowering the dose first. She wasn’t saying that adding Wellbutrin is a bad idea or that people shouldn’t do it, just that in my case, it might be better to see if I can manage on a lower dose first before stacking medications. Basically, she sees it as a Band-Aid solution rather than treating the root cause.

So, I decided to taper down to 5mg, but right now, I’m at 7.5mg for the past few days, and it feels a little bit better. The hunger isn’t as intense, and I can see a light at the end of the tunnel, but it still hasn’t completely gone away. The part that’s hitting me the hardest is that I’ve been feeling really anxious, which I know is part of tapering, but I can’t help but feel reminded of how I felt before Lexapro. It’s scary, even though I know I’m not getting rid of Lexapro completely—just adjusting back to 5mg.

I keep trying to tell myself that if things get bad again, I can always go back up to 10mg, but my overthinking is making this so hard.

Has anyone else gone through this? Did lowering your dose help with appetite and weight gain without ruining your mental health? Any advice or experiences would really help me right now.

We all know that Huohuo is one of the Ten-Lords Commission Judges-in-training that responsible for capturing Heliobus around the Xianzhou Luofu. Although the faction that she is in sounds mighty and all, Huohuo is not like that. Instead of facing the fear, she fucking pisses her pants and she can't stop once she did 😭💢

Mr. Tail couldn't contain himself so he detached himself from Huohuo and went somewhere else, leaving both of us alone. I feel bad for Huohuo so I help her out by drinking and sucking her piss that stained her pants 😛 Let me tell you... her piss tastes heavenly! Can you believe that?! Foxian pisses taste differently from humans! It tastes sweet and way way WAY BETTER than Himeko's Coffee that she brews from her hag pussy 🤮

#If I ever ascended into Aeonhood and become the Aeon of Cunny, anyone who wants to be gazed upon by me should drink Huohuo piss for 100 days straight ✨

Alright! Enough piss tasting! What about her cunny? Since she always pisses her pants and she didn't even have time to clean herself, I took a quick smell, and oh my Stellaron... 😤✊

[Military Man That Haunts My TownHouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1j4isil/military_man_that_haunts_my_townhouse/)Mar 6th 2025, 00:34, by [/u/VerenaGh0st](https://www.reddit.com/user/VerenaGh0st)



About a year ago, I smelled cigarettes in my home; I don't smoke and never have. The windows were all closed, I walked downstairs and it was the strongest in the living room. I should mention it was around 2 AM since I'm a night owl, I didn't think much about it because it could've been my neighbors at the time.

I didn't turn on any lights, I walked into the kitchen and grabbed some cereal. I sat down at the dining room table and ate my cereal in the dining room. As I scrolled through my phone, I heard a noise in the living room, like somebody moved something heavy across the coffee table. I'm still surprised I didn't piss myself from fear.

I looked up and saw the silhouette of a tall and bulky man sitting on the couch, I immediately made out the camouflage uniform in the dark. He looked at me. I looked at him. And we literally just stayed like that for a while.

I eventually got up and flipped on the dining room light which shined into the living room. He immediately disappeared. I went upstairs feeling like I had actually gone batshit.

Over the course of the next week, same thing. With the strong smell of cigarettes, I'd walk down the stairs, and he'd be chilling on the couch in the complete dark.

As the next month went on shit kept getting weird, things started moving a literal tiny inch from where they should've been. But only in the living room.

I never had any experiences with him during broad daylight until I was in my kitchen doing dishes that afternoon. I had headphones on like usual as I did the dishes and I suddenly felt someone press right up against my back, and I don't mean like somebody grazed me by accident. I mean they literally stood right up against my back.

Being a female who lives with no men, I literally whipped around so fast that I almost broke my own neck. Nothing. The kitchen was empty.

Small things like that kept happening at random times. When I was sitting watching YouTube. When I was doing my makeup. Even when I was just lying in bed. It was nothing severe. Small things. My hair was moved, feeling someone pat my shoulder or the top of my head.

The only thing that I could really come up with is that it was him. He had never caused ""problems"" exactly. I feel like he could be causing actual chaos and purposely scaring me, but he seems very laid back and sweet.

So I bought him an ashtray. Obviously, he can't use it. Probably? I don't know how ghosts work. But I bought a vintage one and put it on the coffee table in front of the couch.

And every time I pass that table, it's always moved around; if I'm in a different room downstairs, I hear it slide around the coffee table. He seems to like it. That's been my normal for the last several months.

I guess I'm here because the last two weeks, I've really been struggling with depression, and I've noticed when I'm upset, I always get slammed with the smell of cologne. The same cologne every time. I brushed it off the first time, but as it keeps happening, I'm pretty convinced it's him being nearby.

I've never smelled a cologne like it and don't own any cologne at all myself. Anyways. I guess I'm writing this not to ask for explanations. But just to have somewhere to say it. I'm scared if I told someone else they'd probably think I'm nuts.

I’m also sleeping not in any pyjamas so I don’t have my blinds/curtains at all open and so I don’t wake up to any natural light which does make a difference. I like sleeping in no pyjamas but I like waking up to light :(

*I sort of feel like we’re coming to the end of things with us? He’s so disinterested in me? Today (it’s night time but I’ll just post this tomorrow) he was just cutting me off, we were talking about his appearance and I went on very short tangent about something to do with me I think my hair and I didn’t even finish my sentence and he just over talked me to talk about his forehead. Then with the evening he did in fairness say he was tired but he didn’t sound at all tired and he could not get off the phone fast enough. And basically talking to me like some pal for advice about photos for dating sites. F this and f him. Can he just blimmin end it if he doesn’t want me? I don’t want to be around while you prep yourself for others? Fuck the actual fuck off? I’m angry. I’m going to sleep.* 

I don’t feel angry or anything now. Though I do have this sense of unease stirring through me still. The theme today for strands was online dating. Is that meant to be a sign that he IS getting back into that? I feel guilty for even doubting him, but he’s just come out of the blue with all of this self improvement and to actually ask me if I would like it if I saw it on TINDER? Like ??? Who the hell would ask that. If I asked him that same question there would be hell to pay. But no. I shall trust that I know the sort of person he is. And if he doesn’t turn out to be that man? Then he isn’t who I want so it’s hardly a loss. Right? I don’t know. 

Work is… idk where to start. This feels above my pay grade and I don’t think I’m entirely equipped for this but I also sort of feel like maybe I can do it? It’s a step up that’s for sure, but I was selected for the job and idk, am I delusional? Probably. I don’t wanna write about this. But it’s a lot. 

I can’t shake the feeling he’s sick of me. Why wouldn’t he be. 

I’m going to need to lean into my routines and more of a schedule more than ever I think. And I need to set myself up to be as comfy as possible wfh so I need some new slippers and a new keyboard and things like that. I also need to get more serious about my sleep and consistency in my rise time. I also need to work on NOT GETTING DISTRACTED. And also making sure I take proper breaks ie go for a walk or sit outside or stretch or whatever. No eating at my desk, unless I have to. Don’t say yes to anything else work wise. Learn boundaries. Ask questions. Get some nice candles to work with! How can I incorporate goals? Hm. 

I made dinner and it was yum. And I worked til after 7 yay. 

I have a big work day tomorrow. A lot to do to meet a deadline I found out about this afternoon. Cool. I also have flat inspection and therapy. And two meetings. I feel stressed. This is why I need my routines and to feel on top of things. I am fine. I need to change my affirmations I think, I think I need less self worth and more I’ve got this sort of vibes. I’ll talk to her about some new ones tomorrow. I was also thinking of bringing up the “sexual assault” stuff but maybe tomorrow isn’t the day. Maybe the following week. I’ll be stressed as it is and overwhelmed without adding something like that to the mix. Hm. It’s weird to think I’ve been sexually assaulted.. I mean I don’t even know how many times. And the r word? Hm. I’ve always brushed it off, but apparently what has happened isn’t casual. Idk. I don’t know anything.

I have a good job that pays decently for my area (about $25 an hour, but where I live has high cost of living (Seattle)) that is pretty easy and I have plenty of opportunity to move up. I have a small house with a decent yard I rent from family ($2,200 a month, all utilities included except electricity, which is approx. $180 a month right now due to the cold weather. In summer it's only about $80-90, and internet which is about $90) that I split with my fiancé. On paper, everything looks wonderful for me.

We don't really struggle to get food or purchase anything in excess. To be honest lately we've been going out very rarely. We had some unexpected expenses at the beginning of the year due to one of our dogs passing unexpectedly, but my fiancé handled it.

Unfortunately though, I have no money. I had a rough time in my previous position that led me to take time off work frequently due to stress, illness, etc. and I didn't have a lot of savings to begin with. Due to some other previous unfortunate circumstances, I owe about $3,000 in credit card debt, and $2,000 to my school when i attempted to go to college. I have no savings, and currently I am scraping by paycheck to paycheck with just trying to live and play catch up. Thankfully my fiancé has parents who were smart with money and made him start saving early, so if anything crazy happened I'd be fine. 

But I'm just so frustrated, I feel like I'm in this weird limbo. I'm not poor per se in the sense I have a roof over my head and food on the table, but I can't afford anything but the bare minimum at the moment. I don't even want anything luxurious or expensive, I just wish I could afford to do something other than work and come home.

 I miss going out with friends for coffee, I want to go back to school, I want to have savings and be stable in my money. I'm tired of seeing $0.07 in my bank account after my bills are paid. I want something better for myself, and my fiancé. I want to save for our future wedding. I just don't want the anxiety that looms over my head when a bill payment goes through and I'm worried about my account going negative again. 

I can't ask for help from my parents as neither of them were ever very smart with their money and thus are in a similar predicament to myself. (In fact the reason I'm in so much debt is due to my mom, but that's a story for another day) I feel like I'm just on a never ending wave of stress, and I also feel like I'm not allowed to feel this way because I'm not ""poor"" enough despite not having any money.

Anyway, thank you for reading/listening. I guess if anyone has any advice on how to get out of this loop? I know $5,000 isn't going to magically drop into my lap to alleviate my debts and help me relax and build savings, but any sort of advice would be helpful.",1,1741244077.0,poor,1,0.66,False

So, how do you protect your data from getting snatched by shady characters? Enter **TurisVPN**. Here's how it works:

1. **Encryption**: Imagine your data is a secret text. A VPN locks it up with a crazy strong password, so no one can peek at your online activity. It’s like a digital safe for your info. 🔒
2. **Anonymity**: VPNs hide your IP address like you’re an internet ninja 🥷. No one can track where you are or what you’re doing, which is pretty great if you want to stay under the radar.
3. **Public Wi-Fi Survival**: You know that sketchy Wi-Fi at the coffee shop? Hackers LOVE that stuff. A VPN is like your personal bodyguard, keeping your data safe while you enjoy overpriced coffee. ☕💻
4. **Bypass Geo-restrictions**: Can’t watch that one show on Netflix because it’s “not available in your country”? VPN to the rescue! You can trick the internet into thinking you're in a different country and watch whatever you want. 🍿

In short, a VPN is like your online superhero—protecting your data, hiding your tracks, and making sure you don’t fall victim to internet shenanigans.

*Evening: Milk-based coffee (+ occasionally 1 cookie)*

*Dinner: Lettuce + Tomatoes Greek Yogurt Salad*

  
For some reference: 4 years back, I was around 93 kgs. I lost weight within 6 months through minimal workouts *(definitely not as intense as Chloe Ting's)* and walking *(I was a college student, so I walked around 7000 steps a day)*, but I believe it was mostly due to my unhealthy diet. I had a really bad relationship with food and ate barely one meal a day. I got to 67 kgs last year, but I got extremely weak, so I worked on eating normally again. 

But I gained 8 kgs, lol.

We each live in different cities, but try to meet up once a week. When we do, I notice that the two of them will be on the same page about moving onto another activity or going home, whereas I will want to stick around or continue the activity. For example, if we’re playing a game that doesn’t have a defined ending, they’ll get tired of it while I still have more rounds left in me. If we go to a coffee shop or restaurant, they’ll start packing up as soon as they finish their food/drinks, but I’d typically prefer to stick around, chat, and enjoy the atmosphere. I always feel a bit disappointed to be taken out of the experience, but I wouldn’t say I feel unfulfilled in the grand scheme of it.
