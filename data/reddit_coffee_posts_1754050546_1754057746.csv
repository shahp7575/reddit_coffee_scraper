I‚Äôm excited to share a project I‚Äôve been working on called *Las Chispas*.

I always found that most language apps teach you vocabulary and grammar, but not how to actually talk to people in fun, real-life situations. So, I built something with witty dialogues for situations like grabbing a coffee sometime or randomly meeting at a gallery or library. It's meant to be light-hearted and tasteful but practical and useful too.

It focuses on:

* Witty, real-life dialogues (in Spanish & English)
* Adjustable audio speed & easy translation toggles
* A shadowing method that boosts retention and improves pronunciation

It‚Äôs a deliberately small MVP ‚Äî free, web-based, and built to gather your early feedback. I have exciting features like interactive vocab maps and language islands coming soon. If you‚Äôre tired of flashcard and gamified guilt-based apps and just want to learn how to spark real conversations, you might dig this! I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

I would like to resolve myself if possible, and have had a search around - and have seen issues where people have replaced the thermostat and or the pump. I am unsure for certain if either of these are the issue here - can anybody advise?  
  
I have some descaling fluid left - so may just run it through another descale cycle but I expect not as I have already done this.  
  
The pump gives an intermittent whirr-whirr sound when it should be steaming milk, as opposed to the normal pump sound - so maybe that is the issue.. but what about the heat?!... ",1,1754055518.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1mewp7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1mewp7j/why_do_i_keep_getting_punished_for_being_friendly/,Why do I keep getting punished for being friendly,"I‚Äôm currently doing an internship in a corporate office, and something happened recently that made me feel really uneasy and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm missing something or if I did something wrong.

There‚Äôs a new intern, let‚Äôs call him Jason. He seemed friendly, down to earth, and respectful at first. We sit near each other, so we naturally talk more than I do with others, and I tend to joke and be friendly with my team in general. I don‚Äôt overshare or get too personal with anyone - I‚Äôm polite, kind, I keep things surface-level, and I try to stay professional while still being myself.

Jason asked if we could start doing weekly 1:1 drawing sessions together (outside of our usual coffee chats), just to practice and give each other feedback. I‚Äôm an artist and he had seen my portfolio and wanted my input. At first, I said yes, thinking it could be a nice creative break, nothing too serious.

But literally later that same day, we were in a team meeting (with more people), and I spoke up to contribute something. Jason blatantly interrupted me while I was mid-sentence and just kept talking over me like I wasn‚Äôt there, it was so disrespectful and not subtle at all.

My manager and mentor both turned to look at me as this happened, then my mentor actually turned to me while he was speaking and then said, ‚ÄúYou were saying, (name)?‚Äù - so it wasn‚Äôt just me who noticed. Everyone could see what happened and it made me realise I wasn‚Äôt being dramatic and that was actually really disrespectful.

Only issue is that this is the SECOND person at my workplace to do this to me, he‚Äôs not the first one. This kind of behavior reminded me of another colleague I had issues with earlier in the internship, and he repeatedly disrespected me for nearly a year until it blew up into an argument later due to resentment and anger. I ignored the signs with him for too long and gave him too much of benefit of the doubt and things eventually escalated.

I‚Äôm just frustrated because the exact same thing is happening to me AGAIN and I‚Äôm facing disrespect and misogyny from someone I‚Äôve been nothing but nice to, and for some odd reason I‚Äôm always the victim of men like this. What‚Äôs worse is this guy is a recent hire and he‚Äôs already showing signs of disrespecting my publicly, I don‚Äôt want to see how he‚Äôs going to act as he gains more experience. If I had known he was going to be like this I would have kept my distance.

I was trying to figure out why this pattern keeps repeating with me and why I seem to keep attracting disrespect, and realised maybe it‚Äôs because I seem too friendly or nice? But I act like this with everyone, I‚Äôm genuinely just a happy and jokey person so I try and talk with everyone. It‚Äôs just men my age start acting weird and start undermining me because of it.

I cancelled our weekly drawing sessions because I‚Äôm not going through this again, I‚Äôve already been through getting disrespected for months by my other colleague enough and I‚Äôve learned to see the patterns and how it starts. I‚Äôve decided to keep a little distance from him.

I guess what I‚Äôm struggling with is this: I‚Äôve worked so hard to come out of my shell and become someone who laughs, smiles, and connects with others after years of depression and isolation. Being able to joke around and express myself feels like a luxury I fought for, so it stings when that warmth is misread or taken as permission to be disrespectful. It took me SO much hard work to get to where I am and I don‚Äôt want to let anyone take this away from me.

Is this a common experience for other women in corporate spaces? Does being friendly really invite this kind of behavior, or am I just having bad luck with certain types of men? I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I have to constantly edit myself just to be treated normally.",2,1754055407.0,emotionalintelligence,1,1.0,False

1mewlio,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mewlio/does_ninja_cfn601_espresso_machine_deliver/,Does Ninja CFN601 Espresso Machine Deliver Barista-Level Quality? Read This Review!,"The Ninja CFN601 Espresso & Coffee Maker instantly intrigued me due to its versatility and barista technology. As someone who can't start the day without a great cup of coffee, I was eager to see if this machine could meet my standards. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve pushed this product to its limits, experimenting with every feature it offers. Below, I share my honest thoughts and experiences using this device.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek black exterior of this coffee machine immediately catches the eye. Its compact footprint makes it ideal for my cluttered kitchen countertop, yet it doesn't sacrifice capability for size. The built-in frother tucks away neatly, ensuring the unit exudes sophistication without unnecessary bulk. One morning, while awkwardly maneuvering around a stack of dirty dishes, I accidentally bumped into the touch screen panel, but it didn‚Äôt even flinch. The material feels sturdy, though the black plastic exterior can easily pick up fingerprints, which some might find irritating.

**Functionality and Features**  
This espresso and coffee maker is packed with customizations. The 19-bar pressure system, branded as Barista Plus Technology, guarantees optimal flavor extraction. I tested it by brewing different espresso styles, like Classic, Lungo, and Over Ice. Every single cup provided a rich, balanced flavor alongside a velvety crema, amplifying the experience of sipping caf√©-style drinks at home. Brewing coffee grounds allowed for even more flexibility. Whether I needed a quick single cup or prepared a 12-cup carafe for a brunch gathering, it handled everything with ease. The adjustable cup tray accommodated everything from my small espresso shot glasses to an oversized travel mug, which is a thoughtful touch.  

[Discover if Ninja CFN601 is on sale at Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0b9yp76fn/)

**Performance**  
What truly stood out during my daily use was how quietly and efficiently this machine operates. The semi-automatic interface simplifies the brewing process. I initiated the Delay Brew option one night when I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd be able to function the next morning without immediate caffeine. Waking up to a hot, freshly brewed Carafe was game-changing. That said, a minor frustration arose when I noticed steaming milk for lattes or cappuccinos requires a bit of practice to achieve the right consistency with the fold-away frother.

**Highlights**  
- Effortlessly brews espresso and coffee grounds.  
- Built-in, fold-away frother for cappuccinos, lattes, and much more.  
- Ideal for single shots or large 12-cup carafes.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The exterior finish is prone to visible smudges.  
- Frothing milk consistently could be challenging for beginners.  
- Capsules are not included and need to be purchased separately.  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve used the Breville Nespresso VertuoLine before, which also integrates capsule-based brewing for espresso. While that machine nails simplicity, it lacks the flexibility offered by this coffee maker in terms of brew sizes and style customizations. On the other hand, models like Keurig K-Cafe emphasize user-friendliness at a lower cost but don‚Äôt deliver the 19-bar pressure system essential for achieving true espresso flavor. This coffee maker, therefore, positions itself as a middle ground between advanced espresso machines and simpler coffee brewers.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Pricewise, it aligns closely with premium espresso machines but offers far more versatility, such as the ability to transition between home-brewed espresso and large coffee servings. The Ninja CFN601‚Äôs feature set gave me the impression I was paying for both quality and the convenience of having myriad options. While the initial investment isn‚Äôt minor, every cup has justified it with taste and consistency. If you‚Äôre looking for an all-in-one coffee solution, the value seems to hold up well next to similar devices.

Fatty food and coffee (even decaf) are my only consistent triggers, and BAM is the only condition I've found where it accounts for every single one of my symptoms:

Loose, urgent stools, particularly in the morning 
Greasy, fatty stools that sometimes feel like they're burning when they come out 
Undigested food (usually vegetables in stools)
Gas
Fatigue/brain fog

Anyway, I always wondered why decaf has the same effect as regular coffee and turns out it also stimulates bile production.

Found a couple of studies that say around a third of IBS-D cases are attributable to BAM.

1mewj6d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mewj6d,Manali,"A solo trip to Manali just because I felt like going. Please don‚Äôt come at me saying you could have gone here, there and so on. It was the first place I had in mind and just set off with that thought. 

1. Stay - I stayed at Fl√ºstern Hostels, precisely their property which is situated in Naggar (about a 25min drive away from Manali). The hostel was very chill, not a lot of crowd since it wasn‚Äôt exactly tourist season. The owner - Nitesh, is an excellent host who almost feels like a traveller with you. He will take you and fellow hostellers around in his car a couple of times. Their meals are incredibly homely, appetising and timely in nature. It‚Äôs very quiet locality with homestays all around but a serene location. 

2. Transport - I took a bus from Delhi to Manali. Since I didn‚Äôt have a vehicle of my own, for long travels (between Naggar and Manali), I would hail a taxi which does cost a bomb so figure out your mode of transport. Carrying a four wheeler is an option but the damn roads are a challenge for a driver who isn‚Äôt used to the single lane, always going uphill winding kind of roads. Will be happy to provide a number for the taxi operator who won‚Äôt try to rob you at every step. 

3. Crowd & local scene - As I said, July was probably the dullest month I could have picked to go. My stay which was in Naggar had almost no one so not a lot happening there. Manali as usual is a very touristy spot, family place and a hangout arena for the Delhi boys. Id suggest going to Old Manali which is a 15-20min walk from Manali itself. It‚Äôs the place which has always has a crowd, thanks to foreigners. Old Manali absolutely is the place to be in the evenings. Especially sunshine cafe which always has people in it throughout the day and it picks up scores of crowds once the evening sets in. Lovely owner, manager and other people working there. 

4. Cafes and restaurants I tried -
    (a) Cafe Coffee Drips - Located centrally on the Manali Mall Road. Grab a table outside and it has a good view of the entire Mall Road. Food and beverages were decent. 
    (b) Chopsticks - Another Mall Road located joint with some really good food. Kick back, have a beer and enjoy a drink for yourself. 
    (c) Johnson Bar & Restaurant - Located on the way from Manali to Old Manali. Seemed like a good spot, slightly expensive but sadly had no crowd that night. 
   (d) Mountain View Noodles - Amazing place. I especially loved the food and had a great time at their balcony seating area up there. It‚Äôs located right next door to Noodles. Definitely pay this restaurant a visit. 
   (e) Sunshine Cafe - Once I went to sunshine, I never went to any other place. For an entire day, I hung out here. Had good food, enjoyed reading a book and as the night set in, downed a couple of drinks, had the pleasure of listening to some live music by people who were travelling in Manali. The food is ridiculously good with such a vast menu and every cuisine tastes spot on. Plus, they have their ‚Äúgreen‚Äù sorted which is a very convenient thing. 

Any other questions, would be happy to entertain. ",8,1754054981.0,SoloTravel_India,5,1.0,False
1mewi55,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYTools/comments/1mewi55/find_out_if_knipex_13_72_200_me_wire_stripper/,Find Out If KNIPEX 13 72 200 ME Wire Stripper Truly Excels Review,"The **KNIPEX 13 72 200 ME Forged Wire Stripper** joined my toolbox recently, promising a range of features that seemed too good to ignore. Over the past couple of weeks, I had plenty of opportunities to put it through its paces while working on DIY projects and repairs around the house. As a modest handyman, tools like these are as vital to me as coffee in the morning, but not all of them live up to their big claims. This is my firsthand take on how this wire stripper performs, with its strengths and areas that could use a little polish.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This wire stripper immediately feels like a premium tool. The stainless steel construction is robust and has a satisfying weight of just under 11 ounces. At 8 inches long, it fits comfortably in my hand, and the multi-component grip ensured hours of use without any hand fatigue. I especially appreciated the atramentised, lacquered finish, which not only resists wear but also adds to the tool‚Äôs sleek aesthetic. The locking mechanism was a handy touch since it‚Äôs ambidextrous, making the tool equally convenient for left-handed and right-handed users. Details like the knurled tip and wide flat jaws are small but thoughtful features that make gripping wires and other small objects much easier.

**Usability and Performance**  
From the first time I used this tool, it was clear the designers genuinely had functionality in mind. Stripping both solid and stranded wires ranging from 10 to 20 AWG was smooth and precise. The locating ridges made it incredibly simple to find the right stripping holes ‚Äì a design feature I hadn‚Äôt realized would be so useful. Cutting 6-32 or 8-32 screws was impressively straightforward, and importantly, I didn‚Äôt have to delve into awkward threading; the tool can cut screws from the front or back. Its ability to handle different materials ‚Äì including wires, NM-B, BX, and MC cables ‚Äì genuinely made it an all-rounder. I even tested its claim of reduced cutting power, and it performed with a noticeable 25% reduction in effort compared to my older tools.  

**Check [KNIPEX 13 72 200 ME] price on Amazon.**

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Sturdy and durable stainless steel construction.  
- Easy-to-use locating ridges simplify wire stripping.  
- Cuts screws with no threading required.  
- Comfortable handle design reduces strain during extended use.  

**Weaknesses**  
As with most tools, perfection isn‚Äôt guaranteed. While the performance was overwhelmingly positive, here are a few lesser aspects I noticed:  
- Slightly larger in size, which might not suit those with smaller hands.  
- The high-end build means it‚Äôs heavier than some competing products.  
- The locking mechanism felt stiff at first, though it loosened up with regular use.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this tool to other wire strippers like the Klein Tools 11063W or the Irwin Vise-Grip wire strippers, clear differences stand out. The KNIPEX beats both in terms of precision and cutting versatility, especially with its ability to handle a broader range of materials like battery cables and BX/MC. The Klein Tools model, however, is lighter and slightly more user-friendly for beginners. Meanwhile, Irwin Vise-Grip is a budget pick but noticeably lacks the durability and advanced features that KNIPEX offers.  

**Affordable Quality**  
While the price point for this forged tool certainly leans towards the premium side, it‚Äôs the features and attention to detail that ultimately justify it. Wire strippers are tools most of us want to invest in once, and KNIPEX ensures lasting reliability. Compared to similar models that might cost a little less but lack such robustness or versatility, this item proves its worth ‚Äî especially if you frequently find yourself working with different cables and wires on varying projects.

## **The Parking Spot**

---  

**INT. PARKING LOT ‚Äì MIDDAY.**  
A tiny, tight parking lot in some ambiguous hybrid town.
A single empty space. Two cars pull up at the same time.

**CAR 1: A charming, rattling minivan with daffodil stickers.**  
**Driver: DEWI (50s, Welsh tour guide, calm but passive-aggressive).**

**CAR 2: A dented Dodge Charger with a Sox bumper sticker.**
**Driver: RONNIE (40s, Boston tourist, hot-headed with iced coffee in hand).**

They both edge forward. And stop. The standoff begins.

---

**RONNIE**  
*(out his window)*  
Ey! You blind or just slow, Gandalf? I got my blinker on!

---

**DEWI**  
*(mildly amused)*  
Ohh, aye, your *blinker*... is it? Lovely light. Not quite the Queen‚Äôs decree though, is it?

---

**RONNIE**  
I *signaled.* Signaling‚Äôs the rules. Rules of the road. You ever read a driver‚Äôs manual, or you just consult the ancient runes?

---

**DEWI**  
Well *technically*, lad, I was parallel to the space a full second before your turn signal even winked at me.  
And here in Cymru‚Äîsorry, the United Kingdom of Parking Etiquette‚Äîwe respect *timing*. Not *flashing gadgets*.

---

**RONNIE**  
What even *are* you sayin‚Äô? You from Narnia? Middle Earth? You just invent a place called *Cymru*?

---

**DEWI**  
It‚Äôs *Wales*, you cultural omelette.  
Where we know how to *merge* politely and *park* with dignity.

---

**RONNIE**  
Dignity?! Buddy, I parallel park *in the snow,* uphill, behind a city bus, *while texting my ma.*  
You wanna throw down over a parking spot, we can do that.  
I got a folding chair in the trunk and rage to spare.

---

**DEWI**  
Aye.  
And I‚Äôve got a copy of the *Mabinogion* and a strong moral code.
Let‚Äôs *dance*, Yankee.

---

(Sudden silence. Then‚Ä¶)

**YOU** *(from a distance, whispering like Attenborough)*  
Look at these two.  
You got the Boston guy‚Äî*coffee in hand, veins poppin‚Äô like rigatoni.*  
And the Welshman‚Äîcalm, majestic, *probably knows seven ways to say ‚Äúhill‚Äù in poetry.*

They‚Äôre not gonna fight.  
They‚Äôre gonna *passive-aggressive talk* for forty-five minutes until they both miss their appointments and forget why they were mad.

Now who parks?  
The *French guy* who pulls in backwards, no signal, bumpin‚Äô electronic jazz.  
Unbothered. Unapologetic. Doesn‚Äôt even lock the car.

1mewho7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1mewho7/day_10_42f_recovery_and_tips/,Day 10 - 42F Recovery and Tips,"Made it to day 10 and finally feeling ok. Got my first good night of sleep last night and drinking some coffee this morning! 

Day of surgery was fine. Have a history of post op nausea/vomiting and was treated aggressively for it by anesthesia. Once home and instructed to take my first Percocet (only took half), I became super nauseous and almost threw up. Took a promethazine that I requested and was able to sniff an alcohol pad to ward off the vomiting. Called my doctor for a less strong pain med. 

Days 1-4 were fine. Managed to eat some food. Only took rx pain meds at night. Thought I was going to be one of the lucky ones. Eat as much as you can these days. 

Days 5-7 humbled the shit out of me. Pain was brutal, especially at night. Rethought my life choices during this time. Only slept 2 hours at a time. Crying made it worse with increased secretions. Relied a lot on lidocaine spray provided by my doctor. The cepacol lozenges I tried were flavored too aggressively and I could not tolerate them. Ymmv. 

Each day after has gotten marginally better, but with minor setbacks each day. I was able to shower and get out of bed each day/perform small tasks around the house. Today is the first day I feel pretty good so far. 

I also bought all of the things and my must have recommendations are as follows:

Humidifier 
Jaw ice pack - wore these from post op to day 8
Powdered Tylenol 
Gum - doctor told me to chew immediately once home and a couple times per day. I really think this helped with jaw/muscle mobility 
Anti-nausea meds - ask for them 
Steroids - started day 2-5. Ask for them

Hope this helps!

Check this out.  I've been drinking espresso for the past, month?  Maybe not every day, but every couple of days.  Maybe it's a straight shot, an attempt at a latte lol, an Americano.  

Prior to all this, I was drinking several cups of coffee a day.  k-cups mostly, before all this.  I had some moka pot pours, some pour overs that I would make on the weekends.  At work I'd go through several cups a day.  

Since I've had my machine, and since I've been having more fresh coffee daily, my interest in these k-cups has plummeted.  Absolutely no cravings for coffee (in general), mid day anymore.  

Additionally....these k-cups don't taste the same anymore lol.  

it's been an interesting experience with this new machine.  My whole life has changed haha.",7,1754054797.0,espresso,4,0.82,False
1mewg36,https://i.redd.it/onhko71dtegf1.jpeg,After a LOT of trial and error I finally have made a valk deck which is pretty reliable and works well (as well as you could hope for) into the meta,"Bungee - kills early ramp (and it‚Äôs bungee of course you have 4 copies)
Conman - can apply pressure, charge valk, be used as final mission bait and doesn‚Äôt charge block
Teleport - can be used to teleport splash cards in, or gravestones to stall, as well as activate valk. It also draws you a card which is why I‚Äôve been using it instead of teleportation zombie 
Trapper - solid environment that can help finish of cards which have already been splashed, and can cover popular plant environments like coffee grounds and pear paradise 
Barrel - the MVP of the deck, charges valk twice, can combo with final mission for insane value, can be teleported in or just combined with fireworks for instant activation, combos with jesters and deadbeard does high damage 
Final Mission - activates barrels, synergises with valks and can be used to clear lanes and help remove specific threats like starch lord and wing nut
Fireworks - similar to barrel in most aspects
Jested - the dark horse of the deck, can surprise opponents and substantial chip damage when combined with splash cards 
Kite Flyer - card draw
Moustache Monument - although a little bricky, the 4 copies are neccesary to go with the valks
Rocket - Takes out so many plant threats like laser bean, fig, aloe saurus and plants buffed by fertiliser or pod father 
Valk - it‚Äôs a valk deck

1mewegk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mewegk/the_home_i_dropped_out_of_college_to_work_at_an/,"The Home (I dropped out of college to work at an Old-Folks Home, and now I can't sleep at night.)","This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.¬† Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn‚Äôt own a lot, and anyway, I wasn‚Äôt coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of¬†*Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn‚Äôt like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn‚Äôt. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn‚Äôt bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn‚Äôt been updated since the 80‚Äôs, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn‚Äôt too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA‚Äôs, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident‚Äôs beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly.¬†

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I‚Äôve never told anyone:

I‚Äôm terrified of old people.

I don‚Äôt know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it‚Äôs just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn‚Äôt bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading¬†*Salem‚Äôs Lot*¬†by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn‚Äôt need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA‚Äôs, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn‚Äôt want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch¬†*Supernatural.*¬†Sometimes we‚Äôd shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched¬†*Nosferatu*¬†at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria‚Äôs are garbage, but the Home‚Äôs food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA‚Äôs and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn‚Äôt for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don‚Äôt exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they‚Äôd quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn‚Äôt complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing¬†*Elden Ring*¬†and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn‚Äôt have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn‚Äôt mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn‚Äôt want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn‚Äôt looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my¬†*Beserk*¬†brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn‚Äôt know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into¬†*Beserk*¬†too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. ‚ÄúFor shift exchanges,‚Äù she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying ‚Äúsure.‚Äù I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn‚Äôt have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we‚Äôd play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn‚Äôt have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I‚Äôd ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn‚Äôt really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA‚Äôs hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn‚Äôt talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn‚Äôt really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn‚Äôt have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That‚Äôs when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won‚Äôt go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don‚Äôt know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena‚Äôs phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena‚Äôs name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn‚Äôt respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she‚Äôd ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn‚Äôt risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn‚Äôt hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

‚ÄúGet up. Get over it. You have a life to live,‚Äù she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn‚Äôt a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena‚Äôs apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn‚Äôt want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn‚Äôt true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don‚Äôt think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a ‚ÄúLena‚Äù living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I¬†*knew*¬†I wasn‚Äôt crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn‚Äôt said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn‚Äôt know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for:¬†

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn‚Äôt a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn‚Äôt do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss‚Äôs office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home‚Äôs records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.¬† I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss‚Äôs door was locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA‚Äôs about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read ‚Äúarchived footage‚Äù. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said ‚ÄúFootage moved to Secondary Storage.‚Äù

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren‚Äôt allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn‚Äôt closed the camera window.

She didn‚Äôt look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

‚ÄúI always forget the damn spoon.‚Äù

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA‚Äôs in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren‚Äôt usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that¬† I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss‚Äôs keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn‚Äôt even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet‚Äôs handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn‚Äôt recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.¬† I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don‚Äôt know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn‚Äôt care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn‚Äôt say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn‚Äôt go home. I didn‚Äôt trust my apartment was safe.¬†

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS‚Äôs and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled ‚ÄúLena‚Äù and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn‚Äôt remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn‚Äôt turn. It didn‚Äôt look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena‚Äôs neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms began to expand and contort. Lena‚Äôs body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs fingers and into her body.¬†

Lena‚Äôs body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena‚Äôs mouth was open in a scream I couldn‚Äôt hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn‚Äôt look away. I hated it, but I couldn‚Äôt stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word ‚ÄúEvidence‚Äù written on it.

I was a coward. I should‚Äôve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should‚Äôve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I‚Äôve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don‚Äôt require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don‚Äôt ask questions.

But I know now I haven‚Äôt run far enough. For the past month, I‚Äôve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last.

There‚Äôs a reason I haven‚Äôt said the location of the Home, or even which state it‚Äôs in.

I can‚Äôt remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can‚Äôt even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there‚Äôs a blank space where it should be.

I can‚Äôt find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm going crazy.

But I know it‚Äôs real. I can‚Äôt forget what I‚Äôve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it‚Äôs only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can‚Äôt say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It‚Äôs like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can‚Äôt sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

1mewduj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mewduj/does_the_mixpresso_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Does the Mixpresso Single Serve Coffee Maker Review Show Its True Value?,"I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what to expect from the Mixpresso DCM-B-TM Single Serve Coffee Maker when I started using it. Coffee machines come in all shapes and sizes, but what intrigued me here was its 2-in-1 convenience‚Äîa compact coffee maker paired with a 14oz travel mug. As someone who juggles chaotic mornings, I wondered if this device would genuinely simplify my routine or just add to the mess. After diving into daily use, I‚Äôve got some thoughts to share about its performance, features, and any quirks that cropped up.

**Design and Build Quality**

The sleek black exterior and compact dimensions (6.2""D x 5""W x 9.5""H) made an immediate impression. It fits perfectly into tight spaces on my cluttered kitchen counter, and I‚Äôve even managed to sneak it into my work desk setup on occasion. The lightweight design‚Äîjust 2 pounds‚Äîmakes it portable, which could be handy for anyone switching between home and office. The included easy-grip travel mug not only saves you from scrambling for clean cups each morning but also fits most car cup holders. Trust me, I checked. The setup feels modern and well-thought-out, although the plastic material doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúluxury.‚Äù Considering this is a budget-friendly option, the materials feel adequate for what you‚Äôre paying for.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**

This little machine packs a surprising punch. With its 700w power output, the coffee is hot and ready in about three minutes, which is just long enough for me to pack my lunch without feeling rushed. It's compatible with coffee grounds but, notably, doesn‚Äôt support K-cup pods. Initially, that felt limiting because I like the convenience of pods for quick brewing, but I realized it allowed me to explore different ground coffees, unlocking better flavor and savings in the long run. 

What I particularly enjoyed was the 100% automatic function. You load the coffee grounds, pour in some water, press a single button, and voil√†‚Äîa fresh cup of coffee. After brewing, the machine automatically shuts off, which is a godsend for absent-minded folks like me who forget to turn devices off before leaving the house. A quick press of the button without grounds will drain and clean the machine, making maintenance a breeze.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Cleaning kitchen gadgets is usually my least favorite chore, and this is where the Mixpresso DCM-B-TM pleasantly surprised me. The reusable filter rinses out easily, and both the coffee maker and travel mug can be hand-washed or popped in the dishwasher. I tried both methods to see if there was any difference, but the mug and base came out equally spotless either way. The only mild annoyance is that the compact structure doesn‚Äôt leave much wiggle room for cleaning tight corners within the brewing base, but this is a minor nitpick since the water drainage cleaning cycle does most of the work for you.

**Winning Points**

- Compact size perfect for small spaces, like countertops or office desks.
- Quick, hassle-free brewing process with automatic shut-off.
- Reusable filter limits waste and expense of disposable filters.
- Lightweight travel mug fits standard vehicle cup holders.
- Dishwasher compatibility for quick and easy cleaning.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Only supports coffee grounds, leaving pod-lovers out of luck.
- The plastic materials, though functional, lack a premium feel.
- Requires manual water refills with no reservoir for multiple cups. 
- Slightly limited in terms of brewing volume (14oz max).

**Alternative Offerings**

If you‚Äôre wondering how this model stacks up against others, I'd compare it to the popular Keurig K-Mini and BLACK+DECKER Single-Serve Coffee Maker. The Keurig offers a broader compatibility with pods, giving versatility in beverage selection, and sports a sleeker, more premium build. However, it‚Äôs undeniably bulkier and pricier. On the other hand, BLACK+DECKER offers a utility-focus and similarly compact design but leans on a more basic brewing process without the reusable filter, meaning you‚Äôll be tied into buying consumables. Ultimately, the Mixpresso stands out for its affordability and eco-conscious angle with the reusable filter, even if it sacrifices some high-end extras.

**Affordable Quality**

Considering everything, the product strikes a balance that‚Äôs tough to beat for its price point. It‚Äôs a no-frills machine designed to simplify life for coffee drinkers who want something functional without diving into the extravagance of fancier machines. You‚Äôre not looking at advanced brewing techniques, but for straightforward, consistent coffee-making on busy mornings, it hits the mark. Features like the auto shut-off, portable mug design, and minimal countertop footprint make it feel like a smart choice for the price-conscious.

1mewcuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mewcuf/could_the_best_ice_maker_olixis_impress_your/,Could the best ice maker OLIXIS impress your kitchen setup too,"The OLIXIS OLM-PBK ice machine has turned into a little appliance I didn‚Äôt know I needed, but here we are. I must admit I had my doubts‚Äîhow much ice does one household need? Apparently, enough to necessitate an automatic countertop ice maker that churns out bullet-shaped cubes faster than my freezer ever could. With its compact design and portability, this machine found its way into my kitchen and then magically ended up accompanying me on camping trips. Let's just say, my family now treats ice like a rare delicacy.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this countertop ice maker is its sleek and minimalist design complemented by its classic deep black finish. It has this glossy, polished look that almost makes it feel fancier than the typical bulky appliances I own. At just 8.8 inches wide, 11.6 inches deep, and standing 12.5 inches tall, it‚Äôs surprisingly compact considering its output capabilities. Weighing only 15.4 pounds and equipped with a handy carry handle, moving it between the kitchen counter and our RV has been a breeze. I also appreciate the stainless steel accents because they give the whole machine a nice, clean appearance while feeling sturdy enough to handle daily use.  

**Features That Stand Out**  
There‚Äôs something ridiculously satisfying about seeing 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes appear within six minutes. I timed it, and the claim on their feature list holds up. It‚Äôs not just fast; it‚Äôs almost magical how consistent the production is. The device also offers two sizes of ice cubes‚Äîsmall ones perfect for seafood or chilling wine (our camping seafood boil would‚Äôve been impossible without it), and larger ones that kept our iced coffee cold during backyard BBQs. My niece even pointed out the smooth, rounded edges of the cubes, saying, ""No ouchies for your teeth,"" which, honestly, I hadn't thought about until that moment.

Another feature that stands out is the transparent window. Watching the ice form‚Äînoting when the basket fills up and knowing it's about time for a refill‚Äîadds a practical touch and spares guesswork.  

**Positives**  
The OLIXIS ice maker delivers several winning points that justify its spot in my kitchen.  
- Fast production of 9 ice cubes in just 6 minutes.  
- Two size settings for ice cubes cater to various uses, from regular drinks to preserving fresh seafood.  
- Lightweight and easily portable thanks to its compact size and carry handle.  
- An ultra-quiet operation at under 40dB, quieter than my refrigerator's hum.  

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
Operating this machine is so simple, even my children figured it out (which, I'll admit, worried me slightly because they kept producing ice for no apparent reason). The buttons are intuitive‚Äîpress the 'on' button, wait a few minutes, and voil√†. The machine even alerts you when the water tank needs refilling or the ice basket is full, which is immensely helpful as I have a habit of forgetting about appliances in the middle of operating them.

The self-cleaning function has been a game changer for me. Holding down the on/off button for 5 seconds starts the cleaning process automatically, ensuring the machine stays hygienic without requiring repetitive manual scrubbing. Given its direct contact with water, this feature is a lifesaver for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to deal with slimy interiors caused by neglect.

[Check OLIXIS OLM-PBK price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b0dlh7nfq2/)

**Caveats**  
While this little device has amped up my home ice game, it comes with a few minor shortcomings worth mentioning:  
- The reservoir holds only 1.5 liters of water, so you‚Äôll find yourself refilling it frequently when entertaining large groups.  
- The machine doesn‚Äôt keep the ice frozen for long. If unused, the cubes melt back into the reservoir and the cycle repeats. This works for continuous ice-making but not for storage.  
- Bulky in terms of surface access around the transparent lid, meaning you have to be cautious about opening and closing it in tight spaces.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Looking at other options on the market, the OLIXIS OLM-PBK has a solid spot in the mid-range category. A popular competitor, the Frigidaire EFIC108, produces nearly comparable ice speed but lacks the handle convenience for portable use, making it less RV-friendly. Meanwhile, higher-end models like GE Profile Opal Nugget Maker boast advanced features like app connectivity but come with a significantly steeper price tag. For most households, OLIXIS comfortably balances value with solid functionality, though those wanting longer ice storage without melting may lean toward pricier alternatives.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Breaking down its features and performance, this little workhorse feels like an investment that pays for itself, especially for households or campers who value the convenience of quick, consistent ice production. While you‚Äôll need to look elsewhere for ice retention capabilities, the OLIXIS OLM-PBK outperforms expectations for everyday use. Its portability and user-friendly operation make it a ‚Äúgrab-and-go‚Äù appliance for every occasion, from kitchen counters to vans on the go. While not the cheapest option, the reliability justifies the expense.

# Best Live edge Round coffee Table 2025: Buy Now!

The live edge round coffee table is more than just a piece of furniture; it's a statement. It's a conversation starter, a focal point, and a testament to the beauty of natural wood. As we move into 2025, the demand for these tables continues to grow, with homeowners seeking unique and enduring pieces to elevate their living spaces. This review explores the best live edge round coffee tables on the market, focusing on quality, design, and value, ensuring you can make an informed decision when choosing this stunning addition to your home.

## Key features Analysis

The selection of the best live edge round coffee table requires careful consideration of several key features. examining the wood species, dimensions, base material, finish, and overall design aesthetic crucial for making the right choice.

**Wood Species and Grain:**
The type of wood used substantially impacts the table's appearance and durability. Popular choices include walnut, oak, maple, and reclaimed wood. Walnut is prized for its rich, dark tones and intricate grain patterns, while oak offers durability and a classic look. Maple provides a lighter, more contemporary feel, and reclaimed wood, frequently enough sourced from barns or old buildings, adds a rustic, environmentally conscious touch. The grain pattern itself is crucial; a well-defined and visually appealing grain enhances the table's natural beauty and uniqueness.**Diameter and Thickness:**
Dimension is a fundamental aspect to consider when assessing a table's capacity and its ability to adapt to multiple spaces. the diameter, typically ranging from 30 to 48 inches, should suit the size of your living room and the surrounding furniture. A larger diameter provides more surface area but may overwhelm smaller spaces. The thickness of the wood slab, usually between 1.5 and 3 inches, affects the table's perceived solidity and stability. A thicker slab generally indicates higher quality and durability.

**Base Material and Design:**

Besides the top surface, the base of the table strongly influences the product's appeal. The base options often include metal, wood, or acrylic. Many prefer metal for a modern, minimalist look, while wood bases complement the natural aesthetic of the tabletop. The base design can range from simple hairpin legs to more elaborate geometric structures. A sturdy and well-designed base is essential for stability and weight distribution, preventing wobbling or tipping.

**Finish and Sealing:**

Effective finishing is a must to preserve the structure to avoid damage. The finish protects the wood from moisture, scratches, and stains, while also enhancing its natural color and grain. Common finishes include polyurethane, lacquer, and oil-based options. Polyurethane provides a durable, water-resistant surface, while lacquer offers a high-gloss finish. Oil-based finishes penetrate the wood, highlighting its natural beauty while providing a matte or satin sheen. Properly sealed edges minimize the risk of cracking or splitting, ensuring long-term durability.

Key features of the 2025 live edge round coffee tables include:

 Sustainable Wood Sourcing
 Hand-Finished Edges
 Customizable Base Options
 Low-VOC Finishes

## Core Benefits

A live edge round coffee table goes beyond mere functionality; it offers several core benefits that enhance both the aesthetic and practical aspects of your living space.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:**
The live edge preserves the natural contours and imperfections of the wood, creating a unique and organic centerpiece for your living room. No two live edge tables are alike, ensuring that your piece is a one-of-a-kind work of art. The natural beauty of the wood grain and the raw edges add warmth and character to any room, making it more inviting and visually appealing.

**Increased Functionality:**
Despite its artistic nature, a live edge round coffee table is also highly functional.it provides ample surface area for drinks, snacks, books, and decorative items, making it ideal for entertaining guests or relaxing at home. The round shape promotes conversation and allows for easy access from all sides, creating a more inclusive and social atmosphere.

**Durability & Longevity:**
Crafted from solid wood, these coffee tables are built to last. The robust construction and high-quality finishes ensure that they can withstand daily use and maintain their beauty for years to come. Proper sealing and finishing protect the wood from moisture, scratches, and stains, extending its lifespan and minimizing the need for frequent maintenance.

**Sustainability and Eco-Friendliness:**
Many live edge tables are made from reclaimed or sustainably sourced wood, making them an environmentally conscious choice. By choosing a table made from rescued wood, you're reducing your environmental impact and supporting sustainable forestry practices. the natural beauty and durability of these tables also mean that you're less likely to replace them frequently, further reducing waste and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.

## faqs Section

Many buyers have questions about live edge round coffee tables, addressing common concerns helps potential buyers.

**Are live edge round coffee tables suitable for homes with small children?**
Yes, with the right precautions. while the natural edges can be a point of concern, many manufacturers offer options with rounded over edges for added safety. Additionally, parents can use edge protectors to soften any perhaps sharp areas. The stability of the base is also crucial; choose a table with a sturdy base to prevent tipping.

**How do I care for a live edge round coffee table to ensure its longevity?**
Regular dusting and occasional polishing with wood-specific cleaners are generally sufficient. Avoid placing hot or wet items directly on the surface; use coasters and placemats to prevent stains and water rings.Periodically check for any signs of cracking or splitting, and apply a wood conditioner or sealant as needed to maintain the wood's moisture balance. Most importantly, keep it away from direct sunlight.

**Can I order a custom live edge round coffee table with specific dimensions and wood species?**
Absolutely. Many artisans and furniture makers offer customization options, allowing you to specify the diameter, thickness, wood species, base material, and finish. Customization ensures that the table perfectly complements your existing d√©cor and meets your specific needs. Be prepared for longer lead times and potentially higher costs for custom orders.

**What is the typical price range for a high-quality live edge round coffee table?**
The price can vary depending on the size, wood species, base material, and level of customization. Generally, you can expect to pay between $800 and $3,000 for a well-made live edge round coffee table. Tables made from premium wood species like walnut or those with intricate metal bases may command a higher price.

I‚Äôd been lurking in a group called ‚ÄúClub of Lonely Hearts‚Äù for weeks, and recently I started chatting with this guy, Robi. He was funny, always sharing witty work stories and deep book recommendations.
And the best part? He kept saying he supported gender equality. Bingo! I found the one!

Soon, he asked me out for coffee. I put on my black dress, paired it with my fire-red heels, matching purse, and lipstick. I even felt like I was walking in slow motion, like in a commercial.
I arrived a bit early.

‚ÄúYou look amazing in that dress!‚Äù he said with a smile and kissed me on the cheek.
I ordered coffee and a slice of cake. He only had a strong black coffee. We laughed, I nodded, butterflies in my stomach, the whole clich√©.
And then, he said it:
‚ÄúBrigi, I think we should go, I have to wake up early tomorrow.‚Äù
‚ÄúSure, no problem,‚Äù I smiled.

‚ÄúOh, and‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs fair if we split the bill.‚Äù
I swallowed hard but nodded.
Our second date was in the park, feeding ducks by the lake. He held my hand, butterflies went wild in my stomach. Then he asked:

‚ÄúAre you hungry? I could eat a horse.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a l√°ngos stand nearby, what do you think?‚Äù
‚ÄúPerfect!‚Äù he grinned.

I ordered a cheese-and-sour-cream l√°ngos (a Hungarian fried flatbread), he got Nutella. Honestly, the man could live on sugar. While we waited, the smell of fried dough in the air, he said it again:
‚ÄúHope you don‚Äôt mind splitting the bill?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, no, of course‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, but my lips were about to stage a protest and turn downward.
We paid, ate, and walked home hand in hand. And then I told him it wasn‚Äôt working for me.

He agreed. No drama, no tears. I never saw him again.

1mewbbd,https://i.redd.it/iodsa9w9segf1.png,Looking at places to live in Cape Town? Here‚Äôs where people are moving lately.,"Cape Town‚Äôs got something for everyone. Some people want to be near the ocean, some need space for the kids, and others just want to be close to good coffee. If you‚Äôre not sure where to start, here are a few spots locals keep recommending:

**Southern Suburbs**  
This side‚Äôs full of trees, older houses, and good schools. Areas like Claremont and Rondebosch are popular with families. It‚Äôs a bit more chilled than town, and you‚Äôre still close enough to commute without too much stress.

**Sea Point**  
Right by the ocean, super walkable, and always busy. Lots of flats, loads of restaurants, and that long promenade for walks or runs. It‚Äôs not cheap, but you‚Äôre paying for location and lifestyle.

**City Bowl**  
Includes places like Gardens and Vredehoek. Central, but not as hectic as the CBD. You‚Äôll find older homes with a bit of character, plus easy access to town, Table Mountain hikes, and plenty of coffee shops.

**Blouberg**  
Further up the West Coast. Bigger homes, beach right there, and epic views of the mountain. It‚Äôs ideal if you work from home or don‚Äôt mind the drive into town. Also a favourite for kite surfers.

**Durbanville**  
Way more suburban‚Äîspace, quiet, and good value for families. It‚Äôs not near the beach, but you‚Äôve got wine farms and parks, and it‚Äôs got that small-town kind of feel.

**Observatory**  
Bit grungy, bit arty. You‚Äôll find students, musicians, remote workers‚Äîall sorts. Old-school houses, second-hand bookshops, and late-night food. Not fancy, but full of personality.",2,1754054417.0,Moving_in_Cape_Town,0,1.0,False
1mewasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1mewasy/what_makes_msdrwikey_sp6_probiotic_whitening/,What makes MSDRWIKEY SP-6 probiotic whitening toothpaste review worth reading for brighter smiles?,"**Everyday Use of the MSDRWIKEY SP-6 Probiotic Whitening Toothpaste**

This review of the MSDRWIKEY SP-6 Probiotic Whitening Toothpaste comes straight from daily use and a deep dive into its unique features. Balancing a busy schedule while prioritizing oral health, I‚Äôve had ample opportunity to put this toothpaste to the test. It claims to whiten teeth, enhance gum health, and freshen breath, all while incorporating six probiotics into its formula‚Äîan approach that intrigued me right from the start. While I‚Äôve been impressed with the results, there are a few things potential buyers might want to note.

**A Formula That Goes Beyond Basic Whitening**

What stands out immediately is the inclusion of six probiotics, which goes beyond the usual promise of whitening to offer real support for overall oral health. These probiotics aim to balance the oral microbiome, reducing bad breath, minimizing plaque, and improving gum health. Using this toothpaste daily, I‚Äôve genuinely felt that my breath stays fresh much longer compared to regular fluoride-based formulas. The probiotics seem to be doing their magic, and my gums have felt less sensitive.  

The whitening claims are also consistent with what I‚Äôve experienced. Rather than abrasive agents that cause discomfort, this toothpaste gently lifts surface stains over time. My coffee-fueled mornings no longer feel like they‚Äôre permanently staining my teeth. It won‚Äôt give you that instant movie-star smile after a single brush, but the gradual, natural whitening is a significant win for someone like me who has sensitive enamel.

**Fresh Mint Flavor Without the Overpowering Kick**

Another highlight is the fresh mint flavor, which strikes a perfect balance between subtly refreshing and effective. If you‚Äôve ever grimaced through toothpastes that feel so minty they border on spicy, you‚Äôll understand why I appreciated this. I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed after brushing, but my mouth felt clean and fresh for hours. The fact that it‚Äôs fluoride-free was a plus for me since I‚Äôve been trying to incorporate more natural alternatives into my routine lately.

[Check MSDRWIKEY SP-6 Probiotic Whitening Toothpaste price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0f6czsnd6/)

**Easy for the Whole Family to Use**

My teenager even tried it a few times after I raved about the probiotic feature. While teenagers tend not to care about the science behind products, they did notice their breath felt cleaner longer, which is a rare acknowledgment! It‚Äôs gentle on sensitive teeth, making it perfect for families with members who need something less abrasive. The non-chemical mint freshness became an easy hit in our household.  

**Advantages**

- The probiotics positively impacted gum health and breath freshness over time.  
- Gentle and effective whitening without abrasiveness‚Äîperfect for daily use.  
- Fluoride-free formula appeals to those looking for natural oral care options.
- Mint flavor provides a lasting clean without being overpowering.  

**Negatives**

- Whitening results take time, and impatient users might prefer a quicker fix.  
- The consistency of the paste might feel slightly different if you‚Äôre switching from traditional options, though I quickly adjusted.  

**Rival Brands in the Whitening Toothpaste Sphere**

Stacking this up against some leading whitening toothpastes, like Sensodyne or Colgate‚Äôs Pro-Whitening series, a few things became apparent. While these brands focus heavily on instant whitening claims, they often fall short in addressing broader oral care, such as gum health or fighting bad breath throughout the day. Sensodyne does hold an edge for those with ultra-sensitive teeth, but it was refreshing to find that this probiotic alternative didn‚Äôt cause any flare-ups in sensitivity either.  

Compared to boutique brands in the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù oral care market (think Toms‚Äô of Maine), this toothpaste feels like a more rounded solution. The probiotics truly differentiate it. That said, the natural crowd may appreciate how this toothpaste stays fluoride-free and safe for enamel, though it achieves greater long-term results in terms of freshness and whitening. If you‚Äôre looking for whitening with health-conscious ingredients, this formula places itself well above simple off-the-shelf pastes.

**Bang for the Buck**

Price often becomes the trickiest part of assessing daily-use products, especially one as central to your habits as toothpaste. While not the cheapest in its category, I‚Äôd argue the added benefits justify the spend. You‚Äôre not only whitening your teeth but also supporting gum health, addressing breath concerns, and going fluoride-free. When used consistently, the slow but steady whitening results combined with health benefits mean you‚Äôre achieving more than what simpler alternatives can provide. Paying a bit more for that quality feels like a worthwhile trade-off.

Review Inside,"The Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker (model K-Duo Plus) has become a part of my daily coffee routine for a little over two weeks now. With its sleek design, multi-functionality, and features catering to both single-serve coffee drinkers and carafe enthusiasts, it initially seemed like the all-in-one solution I‚Äôd been searching for. But while I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed my time with this machine, there are some caveats worth mentioning alongside the positives.

**Sleek and Space-Saving Design**  
Finding counter space in a crowded kitchen can be a battle, which is why the compact design of this coffee maker immediately caught my eye. Its narrow footprint fits perfectly between my mixer and toaster, and I love the multi-position 60-ounce water reservoir that can be positioned on the left, right, or back. This flexibility is underrated because it allows me to configure the setup based on how my kitchen space is flowing that week. Plus, the matte black finish adds a polished touch that ticks every box for modern aesthetics.

[Check Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07p5w3j29/)

**Brewing Flexibility**  
This coffee maker provides two brewing modes: single-serve and full carafe. It uses both K-Cup pods and ground coffee, so I have endless options depending on what I‚Äôm craving. For a single shot of caffeine, the Strong Brew button delivers a robust, full-bodied cup with rich flavor. And when I‚Äôm hosting brunch or need a larger amount, the 12-cup thermal carafe is a game-changer. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for up to two hours, which is fantastic because guests can serve themselves hot coffee without me hovering over the machine.

**Ease of Use and Programmable Features**  
Operating this coffee maker felt intuitive from day one. Buttons on the interface are clearly labeled, and the programmable carafe auto-brew option has been one of my favorite features. Scheduling my coffee to brew the night before is a lifesaver‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing better than waking up to the aroma of fresh coffee wafting through the house. The Pause & Pour function is brilliant, especially on those mornings when I can't wait for the brewing process to finish. Being able to grab a cup mid-brew is just... chef‚Äôs kiss.

**Positives**  
This machine has impressed me with several high-performing features:  
- The option to brew different sizes (6, 8, 10, or 12 cups) has been versatile for both solo mornings and gatherings.  
- Thermal carafe keeps coffee warm for hours without burning it.  
- Energy-saving auto-off shuts the machine down after five minutes‚Äîmaking me feel less guilty about a forgotten brewing session.  

**Negative Attributes**  
There have been hiccups in my experience, though:  
- Switching between K-Cup pods and ground coffee can get messy, especially when cleaning up stray grounds.  
- Brew time isn‚Äôt the fastest. While it‚Äôs not painfully slow, waiting can feel a bit tedious if you‚Äôre rushing out the door.  
- The carafe lid feels a bit flimsy and drips slightly when pouring too quickly.

**Other Options**  
Comparing this machine to other brands in a similar category, I couldn‚Äôt help but think of Nespresso Vertuo and the Cuisinart Coffee Center. Both of these alternatives share a mix of single-serve and carafe functionality. The Nespresso is a pro at delivering single-serve cups with unparalleled convenience and crema, but it sacrifices variety since it‚Äôs pod-exclusive. The Cuisinart counterpart, on the other hand, provides a sturdier feel and faster brewing time. Where the K-Duo Plus edges them both out is in water reservoir flexibility and carafe features. The 12-cup thermal carafe, in particular, sets it apart because the warmth retention and capacity are superb compared to Nespresso's pod-centric approach.

**Value for Money**  
In assessing whether this machine is worth the investment, I‚Äôve weighed its versatility and durability against competitors. For someone who enjoys switching between single servings and sharing a carafe during gatherings, this brewer really pulls its weight. The programmable auto-brew feature and movable water reservoir elevate its practicality, but the build quality of certain parts could see improvement. While it‚Äôs not an inexpensive option, the variety of features and design make it a smart choice for households with coffee drinkers who have varied preferences.

I agree that the pods do feel like they're getting way too expensive these days and that it feels like Nespresso is raising prices too much.

But that's feelings. What do the numbers tell us? I chose to compare prices now to 2019 because that was the most recent year before COVID, which did all sorts of funky things to prices everywhere.

Coffee prices per pound are up 34% adjusted for inflation from 2019 ($4.14 becomes $5.22 in 2025 dollars) to 2025 ($7).

For the Vertuo pods that Nespresso had in 2019 that they still sell today, the average price has gone up 2% adjusted for inflation from 2019 (average $1.05 becomes $1.32 adjusted for inflation) to 2025 ($1.35).

*Let's summarize that*

**Coffee industry prices: 34% increase**

**Nespresso pod prices: 2% increase**

Even if you don't account for inflation, Nespresso has only increased their prices by about 29% vs 69% (nice) for coffee globally.

The argument that Nespresso pods are getting too expensive is inaccurate. The issue is a macroeconomic one, which is income stagnation exacerbated by runaway inflation.

Her wedding was last weekend. I was invited to attend maybe two months ago over coffee, but the next day wrote me maybe it‚Äôs better not to have me.

Anyway, still friends. Our relationship is growing, just need more time. She‚Äôs helped me network to find connections for work, brought me soup when sick and has been there for me. Definitely a good friend, for only a year of knowing each other (early 30s). 

It doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings to not have gone. But I am wondering about a wedding gift. With what I mentioned, is it nice to gift something? Do you only gift if you‚Äôre genuinely invited? I know people gift when they RSVP no, but unsure in this case and short lived relationship. 

Happy to provide if that‚Äôs the majority, and then what level is appropriate (similar to what I would gift if having gone, or something smaller because I didn‚Äôt)?

1mew1j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1mew1j3/accelerated_weight_loss_question/,Accelerated weight loss question,"Hello all, 

I was hoping to get some feedback from those who have been on this diet for a bit to let me know if this is a common occurrence with the carnivore diet.

I've been on this diet for 60 days now and have maintained strict adherence to the diet. (Beef, Pork, Eggs, small amount of dairy such as cheese or half 'n half) A typical daily intake would be 1lb of 85/15 ground beef, 2oz cream cheese, 5 eggs and a cup of coffee with 2 tbsp of Half 'n Half of creamer. My daily carb intake is 3-4 grams.

The first two weeks I saw a fairly high drop in weight, about 10 pounds which I attributed to mostly water weight as any low carb diet typically prevents your body from holding on to water.

Over the next month I maintained by diet and lost a steady 2-3 pounds a week, my appetite was low and sometimes I had to force myself to eat, here is where things go a bit off.

The last 2 weeks my weight loss has accelerated and my appetite has increased significantly, I've lost another 10 pounds while eating about 50% more calories than the last month. I know this isn't water weight as that was shed off during the first 2 weeks. I don't really work out so I don't think my metabolism had increased in any significant way.

Have any of you experienced this? Is this what they mean by fat adaptation? Since starting I'm down about 35 pounds in 2 months and over the last two weeks I'm seeing anywhere from .5 to 1lb of weight loss a day while still taking in 1800kcal a day roughly",1,1754053715.0,carnivorediet,3,1.0,False

1mevzon,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mevzon/investigate_if_the_best_shaved_ice_machine_by/,Investigate if the best shaved ice machine by Nostalgia is worth it,"Testing out the Nostalgia NICESVR88SW has been an adventure. As someone who loves indulging in a sweet frozen treat during hot afternoons, diving into this electric shaved ice and snow cone maker felt like finding treasure. The first thing that caught my eye was how compact it is. Despite its 64-ounce ice shaving capacity, this machine doesn‚Äôt hog valuable kitchen counter space. It definitely scores points for that initial impression, especially for someone like me, whose countertop battles with an air fryer, blender, and coffee maker daily.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The duo of stainless steel and sturdy plastic gives the product both a premium feel and a lightweight design. At 5.7 pounds, it‚Äôs easy to carry it out to the patio when the kids want to frolic under the summer sun with their ice cones in hand. The side shelves are such a handy addition‚Äîperfect for holding the reusable cones as I fill them up. The product feels well thought out, balancing great looks with user-friendly features.

**Performance Under Daily Use**  
The performance is where the machine shines brightest for me. The push-down handle mechanism makes shaving ice effortless. Even when the kids step in to give it a try, I appreciate the safety function that ensures no accidental injuries. It churns out fluffy, almost cloud-like ice that absorbs syrups gorgeously. We‚Äôve tried it with everything from cola to homemade fruit syrups. It‚Äôs a game-changer for creating soft shaved ice that beats anything I‚Äôve had from store-bought machines.

[Check Nostalgia NICESVR88SW price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b0cjt1g534/)

**Strengths**  
- The machine produces finely shaved, texture-rich ice that pairs perfectly with any flavored syrup.  
- Its 64-ounce capacity can churn out enough snow for family-sized fun in minutes.  
- I appreciate the hidden cord storage‚Äîstoring it is uncomplicated and clutter-free.  
- Reusable cones and an included scoop make serving easy and eco-friendly.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Assembly is required, which might not suit everyone‚Äîthough the process isn‚Äôt overly complicated.  
- The machine can get a bit noisy during operation, especially when dealing with big chunks of ice.  
- Plastic components, like the side shelves, may feel a bit fragile over time with heavy use.  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleaning is straightforward, which is a huge bonus. All parts that come into contact with the ice can be disassembled and gently hand washed. It takes just a few minutes to clean everything, making it ideal for multiple uses in a day. However, the base of the machine isn't detachable, so wiping that down after a particularly syrupy session requires a little added patience.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing this machine to market rivals such as Cuisinart or Hawaiian Shaved Ice machines, the Nostalgia NICESVR88SW holds its ground well in terms of capacity and design. While others might offer slightly quieter motors, they often fall short in thoughtful details like the built-in side shelves or included reusable cones. If you're willing to trade a whisper-quiet shave for those practical extras, Nostalgia‚Äôs product might be the better choice.

**Price Worthiness**  
Despite a few minor quirks, investing in the Nostalgia NICESVR88SW feels like smart spending. Its versatility, combined with its sleek design and family-friendly features, justifies every bit of its cost. Whether you intend to use it occasionally for parties or as a daily fix for that mid-afternoon sweet craving, this snow cone maker quickly proves its value.

1mevz4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1mevz4o/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I insisted on other brands and, after a while, the quality of the coffees improved a lot. I even used the brands I had tested before, and I saw that the flavor was much better.

\- Visual progress tracking  

\- Streak counters for motivation

\- Work mode (track coffee during work hours)

Anyway, as the bus made its usual stop, I was hit with this realizafion that self-care isn't just about pamperkng myself or indulying in spa days (tho tose are great too!).

Whether that's sitting down with a book I've been dying to read, taking a moment to meditate, or even just having a queit cup of coffee in the morning.

It's weird how this sudden insight sorta changed my focus. I'm beginning to see self-care as more of an art of listening to what I need in the moent rather than ticking off a list of activities. It's aboit finding genuine inner peace in the chaos of everyday life, not just waiting for the weekend to relax.

I'm not sure if it was the monotony of the commute that shook this out of me, but I'm grateful for the moment of clarity.

I enjoy morning shenanigans, to me there is something special about the transition from sleep, to semi-awake, to intimacy. It is a good way to start the day amiright? Often when I would initiate morning fun I would be able to get in some foreplay before I would hear comments of 'the dog needs to go out' or 'I have to get ready for work' or 'I have to pee.' The dog and bathroom bits are legitimate, everyone's gotta pee. The work bit is less legitimate as we both work from home and the workday doesn't start for another 2+ hours.

Anyway, this past Sunday the dog let us sleep in a little bit. I heard my wife use the restroom and crawl back into bed. Being that it was Sunday and there was no work to get ready for, all 3 of the standard sex declination lines had been negated. Now typically in this situation I would jump at the opportunity, turn over, and initiate. Arm stroking, gentle messaging, boob grazing, overall just lots of touching and connection; but not this time. I maintained my composure and didn't allow for a physical reaction. I made it obvious that I was awake by cracking my knuckles, stretching, yawning, shifting my position, the usual 'I'm in the process of waking up' stuff. And I waited.

After about 10 minutes I rolled out of bed. At this point (and prior to this point if I'm being honest) it was obvious that nothing was going to happen. We were just two people lying in bed waiting to start the day. So I did, I started my day. Took the dog out, made coffee, and checked on the garden. Folks, if your partner wanted to initiate, wanted to be intimate, wanted to be physically involved, they would be.

The size should be proportional to the furniture and the room's dimensions, leaving an adequate border of flooring exposed around the edges. Proper sizing and shaping of space reflects the scale of the design.A large rug can anchor a seating area in a living room, while a smaller rug can define a specific zone within a larger room.Ensure adequate space allowance around the edges of space.

## Core Benefits

A green and brown rug offers several practical and aesthetic benefits, enhancing the comfort and style of any living space. From creating a relaxing atmosphere to adding visual interest, these rugs contribute to a more inviting and functional home environment.

**Enhanced Visual Appeal:** A well-chosen green and brown rug can serve as a focal point, adding depth and texture to a room.The earthy tones complement a variety of color schemes, from neutral palettes to vibrant hues, creating a balanced and harmonious aesthetic.

The pile height and material composition contribute to the rug's overall comfort, creating a cozy atmosphere that encourages relaxation. The softness helps promote relaxation to people.

A high-pile rug can transform a cold, hard floor into a plush and inviting space, while a low-pile rug offers a more subtle and practical layer of comfort. Ultimately, promoting peace and wellness for the home.

**Sound Absorption:** Rugs can definitely help absorb sound, reducing echo and noise levels in a room.This makes them particularly useful in open-concept spaces or rooms with hard flooring, creating a more peaceful and acoustically balanced environment. Noise reduction is an unbelievable benefit.

By reducing sound reverberation, rugs contribute to a more comfortable and functional living space, improving both the atmosphere and usability of the area. Consider rugs in high traffic areas or rooms to reduce echo.

**Floor Protection:** A rug can protect the flooring underneath from scratches, dents, and other types of damage. This is especially important in high-traffic areas or homes with pets, preserving the beauty and longevity of the floors. Over time, this protection will significantly decrease wear and tear.

Placing a rug under furniture can prevent scratches and dents, while a rug in an entryway can trap dirt and debris, preventing it from being tracked throughout the house. This prevents long term wear.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right rug can be a complex decision, with many factors to consider. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about green and brown rugs to help you make an informed choice.

**What size rug should I choose for my living room?**
The ideal rug size depends on the size of the living room and the arrangement of the furniture. A general rule is to choose a rug that is large enough to anchor the seating area, with the front legs of the sofa and chairs resting on the rug.

For a smaller living room, a rug that fits entirely under the coffee table may suffice. In very large rooms, multiple rugs may be used to define different zones.

**How do I clean and maintain a green and brown rug?**
Cleaning and maintenance depend on the rug's material and construction. For most rugs, regular vacuuming is essential to remove dirt and debris. Spot cleaning with a mild detergent and water can address spills and stains.

Professional cleaning is recommended for deep cleaning and stain removal, especially for delicate or high-end rugs. Be sure to consult manufacturer instructions for rug type and best care.**Are green and brown rugs suitable for high-traffic areas?**
Yes, many green and brown rugs are suitable for high-traffic areas, especially those made from durable materials like polypropylene or wool. Look for rugs with a low pile and a tight weave for added durability and stain resistance.

Regular cleaning and maintenance can help extend the life of the rug in high-traffic areas, preventing excessive wear and tear. Consider a rug pad to help prevent slippage.

# Assess Your Kitchen Needs

# Evaluate Cooking Habits

Consider how you use your kitchen on a daily basis to determine which kitchen appliances are necessary for your home. Are you someone who enjoys preparing elaborate meals, or do you prefer quick and easy recipes? If you love cooking, investing in high-quality kitchen gadgets like a stand mixer or an immersion blender could elevate your culinary experiences. For those who value convenience, smart kitchen gadgets that automate cooking tasks might be ideal. Additionally, if you're an environmentally-conscious cook, energy-efficient appliances can reduce your carbon footprint while saving on utility bills. When evaluating your cooking habits, think about what activities bring you the most joy and how you can enhance those experiences with the right tools. Take the time to choose appliances that not only fit your lifestyle but also give you the best kitchen appliance deals in the market today.

# Consider Family Size

The size of your family plays a significant role in selecting the appropriate kitchen appliances. For larger families, a spacious refrigerator and a dishwasher with a third rack can make food storage and cleanup more manageable and efficient. Smaller households might benefit from compact appliances that save space without sacrificing functionality. It‚Äôs also worth considering kitchen appliance brands that offer various sizes and models to suit different family needs. Whether you‚Äôre cooking for many or just a few, investing in the best kitchen gadgets tailored to your family‚Äôs size ensures seamless meal preparation. Remember to research and compare appliances to find smart kitchen gadgets that cater to your family‚Äôs demands and fit within your budget. As you assess, ask yourself if your current appliances meet your family's needs and how upgrading could improve your kitchen's efficiency.  


# Set a Budget

# Research kitchen appliance deals

When embarking on the journey to furnish your kitchen with essential appliances, crafting a budget is your first step toward smart purchasing. Start by diving into a sea of kitchen appliance deals available online and in-store. With a keen eye on seasonal sales, clearance events, and promotional offers, you can uncover significant savings on top kitchen appliance brands.

# Prioritize based on needs

Once armed with a list of potential deals, it's crucial to prioritize your purchases based on your cooking habits and lifestyle. Identify which kitchen appliances are non-negotiables in your daily routine and which are luxury gadgets that can wait. For instance, if you can't start your day without a caffeine fix, a quality coffee machine should top your list. Conversely, if you occasionally entertain guests, a multi-functional blender might be a secondary priority. Consider the durability and versatility of appliances, as investing in robust products can offer long-term benefits.

Energy-efficient appliances not only help reduce your household's carbon footprint but also significantly cut down on utility bills. Look for appliances that have the ENERGY STAR label, as they meet strict energy performance standards set by the government. Consider investing in a smart refrigerator that adjusts its settings based on your usage patterns or an induction cooktop that heats food faster while using less energy. By selecting energy-efficient options, you can enjoy top-notch performance while being kind to the environment and your wallet.

# Check energy ratings

Checking energy ratings is another crucial step when searching for the ideal kitchen appliances. These ratings give you insight into how much energy an appliance uses, helping you make informed purchasing decisions. The energy guide label on appliances provides an estimated annual energy consumption and cost, allowing you to compare models effectively. High energy ratings often indicate robust performance with minimal energy wastage, making them a wise investment. Before purchasing, take time to compare energy ratings across different kitchen appliance brands to ensure you're getting the best kitchen gadgets that balance efficiency and functionality. By making energy-rating checks a standard part of your buying process, you can optimize long-term savings and support sustainable living.

Each of these tools plays a pivotal role in meal preparation, enabling you to chop, slice, and cook with precision.

# Match Appliances with Kitchen Aesthetics

# Choose complementary designs

When it comes to harmonizing your kitchen appliances with your kitchen's aesthetics, the key is to select designs that complement your existing decor. Consider the color palette and style of your kitchen‚Äîwhether it leans towards modern minimalism or rustic charm‚Äîand choose appliances that echo these themes. For instance, stainless steel appliances offer a sleek look that fits seamlessly into a contemporary kitchen, while retro-inspired designs can add a touch of vintage flair. In addition to aesthetics, think about the finish of your appliances; matte black can provide a sophisticated edge, while glossy finishes might enhance a brighter, more open space. By thoughtfully selecting these design elements, you ensure that your kitchen appliances are not just functional, but also a stylish focal point. Which designs do you think would elevate your kitchen‚Äôs look?

# Consider appliance sizes

Balancing aesthetics with practicality requires careful consideration of appliance sizes. Before purchasing, measure your kitchen space accurately to ensure your new appliances will fit perfectly without overwhelming the area. Large appliances like refrigerators and ovens should not only match the kitchen‚Äôs scale but also leave enough room for ease of movement and accessibility. Compact kitchen gadgets, such as blenders and coffee machines, should fit comfortably on your countertops without cluttering the space. Remember to account for door swings and ventilation requirements, particularly when integrating appliances into cabinetry. Taking these size considerations into account will help you avoid potential design pitfalls and create a harmonious kitchen environment. Have you checked your kitchen‚Äôs dimensions to accommodate new appliances?  


# Plan for Smart Technology Integration

# Evaluate smart kitchen gadgets

Integrating smart technology into your kitchen can transform your cooking experience by enhancing convenience and efficiency. Start by evaluating the current range of smart kitchen gadgets available on the market. These include smart refrigerators that notify you when items are running low, or ovens that can be preheated from your smartphone. As you evaluate options, consider the best kitchen gadgets that align with your cooking habits and lifestyle. Look for energy-efficient appliances that can help reduce your energy bills while being eco-friendly. Research kitchen appliance deals to find affordable options without compromising on the latest technology. Remember, the goal is to select gadgets that not only bring innovation to your kitchen but also enhance your culinary creativity. How do you envision these smart gadgets transforming your daily kitchen routine?

# Ensure compatibility with smart home systems

Once you have identified the smart kitchen gadgets you are interested in, the next step is ensuring they are compatible with your existing smart home systems. It is crucial that these appliances seamlessly integrate with systems like Alexa, Google Home, or other smart home hubs to maximize their utility. Before making a purchase, check the compatibility specifications provided by the kitchen appliance brands. This ensures a smooth integration process and avoids any potential technical issues. Investing in the best kitchen gadgets that are compatible with your smart home ecosystem enhances your home's overall interconnectedness. Consider how these energy-efficient appliances not only fit into your kitchen but also contribute to a smarter, more efficient home.

1mevdsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1mevdsw/feeling_sickdizzy_mid_work_out/,Feeling sick/dizzy mid work out,"Hey lovely people of Reddit 

I‚Äôm after some advice. I‚Äôve been going (back) to the gym for a number of weeks now. 

But the last two lower body days I‚Äôve been unable to finish because I feel sick/dizzy. Just checked my sugar levels and they‚Äôre 5.2 mmol/l, (which I believe is okay!!)


My upper body days the other day was absolutely fine, and if anything that‚Äôs the harder work out. 

I thought Sundays sessions might be that I hadn‚Äôt eaten enough carbs, but today should be okay (I had granola with youghurt about 2 hours before gym) and a coffee with oat milk plus an natural energy drink on the way to the gym

My leg work out today was as follows

Hip adductor (12 x 50 kg, 8 x 50 kg, 6 x 50 kg)
Hip abductor (15 x 65 kg, 15 x 60 kg and 15 x 55 kg. Was pulsing at the top for the last 2 sets)
Hip thrust 15 x 20 kg x 3 reps
Leg press 15x 60 kg x 3 reps
Hack squat 15 x 15 kg 

I ended on the hack squat as when I went to the next one I just felt it in my body it was stupid to continue

Does any one have this issue, or any advice? I‚Äôd really like to be able to complete my leg sets! I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm getting better blood sugar control? Don‚Äôt really know what to do

I work from home and my hours are flexible, meaning that I can start working anytime before 9 and then I can finish after 8hrs. 

Currently I snooze a thousand alarms, start scrolling my phone when still half asleep, crawl out of bed at about 8:50, turn on my pc as I drink my coffee. Then I go smoke a cigarette (I known, I know) on my porch still glued to my phone, wash my face and effectively start working at about 9:15. 

I also always run late with my lunch break, and so I end up working until 6:30pm. This doesn‚Äôt leave me any time for myself, since I start cooking dinner as I turn off my laptop and after dinner I just crash on the couch watching tv shows and playing video games until midnight. 

I really want to have more meaningful and enjoyable mornings. I don‚Äôt want to start my work day still half asleep and already running late, I would like to put the bare minimum into my looks (maybe just wear something comfy that makes sense, instead of grabbing a random stained tank top from the chair, put on some basic makeup and make my hair look presentable) maybe, although I know it‚Äôs utopian, have a quick yoga session or take a short walk around the block (since working from home I can go several days without stepping outside). 

Do you have any hack that really works for you?

## Key Features Analysis

The modern timer plug boasts a range of features designed to enhance functionality and user-friendliness.

**Multiple Programming options:**

Most advanced timer plugs offer a variety of programming options beyond simple on/off scheduling. These can include daily, weekly, and weekend schedules, allowing for customized operation based on specific needs. Some even feature astronomical timers that automatically adjust on/off times based on sunrise and sunset, eliminating the need for manual adjustments throughout the year. This flexibility ensures that devices only operate when necessary, maximizing energy savings.

**Digital Display and intuitive Interface:**

Forget the clunky mechanical dials of the past. the best timer plugs now feature clear digital displays and intuitive interfaces, making programming a breeze. Backlit displays ensure readability even in low-light conditions,and simple button layouts allow for swift and easy adjustments. The user-amiable design ensures that even those unfamiliar with technology can easily set up and manage their timers.

**Battery Backup:**

Power outages can wreak havoc on programmed schedules. To prevent this, many timer plugs incorporate a battery backup system. This allows the timer to retain its settings during a power outage,ensuring that your programmed schedule resumes automatically when power is restored.Battery life can vary, but most models offer several days or even weeks of backup power.

**Overload Protection:**

Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical appliances. Overload protection is a crucial feature that safeguards against electrical surges and overcurrent situations. This feature automatically shuts off the timer plug if it detects excessive current draw, preventing damage to the appliance and reducing the risk of fire. This added layer of protection provides peace of mind and ensures the safe operation of connected devices.

**Random Mode:**

For added security, some timer plugs offer a random mode. This feature randomly turns appliances on and off within a specified time window, simulating occupancy when you're away from home. This can deter potential burglars by making it appear as though someone is home, providing an extra layer of security and peace of mind.

**Compatibility and load Capacity:**

A timer plug's compatibility and load capacity are crucial considerations. It must be compatible with the voltage and frequency of your electrical system, and its load capacity must be sufficient to handle the power draw of the connected appliance.Ensure that the timer plug's specifications match the requirements of your intended use to avoid overloading and potential damage.

## Core Benefits

Timer plugs deliver a multitude of practical benefits for both homeowners and businesses.

**Reduced Energy Consumption:** The primary benefit of timer plugs is the reduction of energy consumption. By scheduling the operation of appliances, you can eliminate phantom loads and ensure that devices only operate when needed.This can lead to significant savings on your electricity bill,especially for devices that consume a lot of power,such as air conditioners,space heaters,and lighting.

**Cost Savings:** reducing energy consumption directly translates to cost savings. While the initial investment in timer plugs may seem small, the long-term savings can be significant. Over time,the cost of the timer plugs is easily offset by the reduction in your electricity bill,making them a worthwhile investment for any energy-conscious consumer.

**Increased Convenience:** Timer plugs automate tasks, freeing up your time and energy. No longer do you need to manually turn on and off lights, fans, or other appliances. This automation can be particularly beneficial for people with busy schedules or those who want to create a more convenient and pleasant living surroundings.

**Enhanced Security:** As mentioned earlier, the random mode feature of some timer plugs can enhance security by simulating occupancy when you're away from home. This can deter potential burglars and provide an extra layer of protection for your property. Setting lights to turn on and off automatically can create the illusion that someone is home, even when the house is empty.

**Extended Appliance lifespan:** By preventing appliances from running unnecessarily, timer plugs can help extend their lifespan. Constant use can put strain on appliances, leading to premature wear and tear. By using a timer plug to limit their operating hours, you can reduce this strain and prolong the life of your appliances, saving you money on replacements in the long run.

## FAQs Section

**Are timer plugs compatible with all types of appliances?**
Most timer plugs are compatible with a wide range of appliances, but it's significant to check the load capacity of the timer plug and ensure it's sufficient for the appliance you intend to use. High-wattage appliances like space heaters and air conditioners may require heavy-duty timer plugs with higher load capacities.

**How easy is it to set up a timer plug?**
Modern timer plugs are designed to be user-friendly and easy to set up. Most models feature a clear digital display and intuitive button layout, making programming a breeze. The included manual typically provides step-by-step instructions to guide you through the setup process.

**Can timer plugs be used outdoors?**
Yes, but you need to use timer plugs specifically designed for outdoor use. These timer plugs are typically weather-resistant and can withstand exposure to rain, snow, and other elements.They are ideal for controlling outdoor lighting, holiday decorations, and other outdoor appliances.

**What happens if the power goes out?**
Many timer plugs feature a battery backup system that allows them to retain their settings during a power outage.this ensures that your programmed schedule resumes automatically when power is restored. The duration of the battery backup can vary, so check the specifications of the timer plug before purchasing.

I just want to preface this by saying me and my cats are no longer living at that house and we are safe at my mom's place. 

Jesus, where to begin? 

So things only escalated after my last post. Tina kept snooping in my room when I wasn't home, John was being a useless pussy whipped cuck and protecting her despite her constantly violating my privacy and space. Sally thankfully got out and is staying with a friend currently. I miss seeing her every day, but I'm happy she got out and she seems a lot happier now. 

Now for the meat and potatoes of this post: Tina tried to poison me. I was having a bad anxiety day after work yesterday. The condition of the house has only deteriorated further because John and Tina are completely checked out since we were set to all move out on the tenth of this month. The yard looks like a jungle, theres mold everywhere, and their pets are constantly pissing and shitting everywhere so the house reeks on a good day. Needless to say, but I couldn't relax after I got home so i went to see Sally. 

We talked for a good three hours during my visit. And thats when she dropped a huge bombshell on me. She caught Tina trying to spike my coffee jug with a bottle of eye drops. Which for those who don't know will give you a bad case of diarrhea. Sally rightfully completely lost it when she caught her doing this, shoved her up against a wall and said, and I quote, ""i will fucking kill you if I catch you doing something like that again."" And to add a little more salt in the wound she spiked her coffee with laxatives the next day and Tina is so stupid she didn't put two and two together. 

This happened about a month ago apparently, Sally was afraid to tell me because she thought I would snap and kill her. Despite literally everything, I kept calm, thanked her for telling me and when I went home late last night I packed a duffle bag, put my cats in their carriers and went to spend the night at my mom's. 

I know some people had their doubts about Sally but she truly does have my back. Im calling in sick to work today and going back for the rest of my stuff. After that I'm blocking John and Tina on everything and trying my best to put this whole ordeal behind me. As for what my next move is, I'm actually moving cross country in about a week to stay with my aunt and uncle in Florida. 

It wasn't an easy decision, but things haven't been working out for me here in my home state for a while now so I figured why not take the leap and try something new? I wanted to make this post after I was settled there but then this happened. 

Sorry for any grammatical/spelling/formatting errors. Im running on two hours of sleep and I have a long day ahead of me. If anyone's interested maybe I'll make another update if anything particularly interesting happens or I could post pics of the house since I'm leaving today anyway. 

If you made it this far thank you for taking this wild ride with me. I've had my fair share of hardships these last few years but now it's on to better things. 

TL;DR: Tina tried spiking my coffee with eye drops. Sally caught her before she could and told me. I packed up and left to stay with my mother till it's time for me to movor to floriday next week. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention John knows about the eye drops incident and her continued snooping and hasn't said a damn thing to me about. It's only thanks to Sally that I know about all this because Tina tells her literally everything. ",10,1754051563.0,badroommates,1,0.92,False

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The Los Angeles Angels (-134) and Chicago White Sox (+212) clash in a mismatch that‚Äôs less ‚ÄúDavid vs. Goliath‚Äù and more ‚ÄúGoliath vs. a very tired mime.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a MLB GM and the wit of a late-night host who‚Äôs had one too many coffee infusions.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Power, Porosity, and the Perils of Underdogging

The Angels, despite a pedestrian 53-56 record, are the bookmakers‚Äô darlings when favored. Their 53.8% win rate in moneyline favorites suggests they‚Äôre the sports equivalent of a slow cooker: not flashy, but reliably capable of turning basic ingredients (like 155 home runs, 4th in MLB) into something edible. Their .408 slugging percentage (13th in baseball) means they‚Äôre not just hitting home runs‚Äîthey‚Äôre *slamming* them into the stratosphere.

The White Sox, meanwhile, are the definition of a ‚Äúglass half-empty‚Äù team. With 99 home runs and a 40-69 record, they‚Äôre the baseball version of a wet noodle in a wrestling match. Their 36.4% win rate as underdogs is statistically significant only in that it‚Äôs slightly better than a coin flip that‚Äôs been cursed by a 19th-century numerologist.

**Implied probabilities** from the moneyline? The Angels have a 59% chance to win (per -134 odds), while the White Sox check in at 32% (per +212). To put that in layman‚Äôs terms: betting on the White Sox is like betting your Uncle Bob will finally learn to text ‚Äî theoretically possible, but not a skill he‚Äôs developing in his 60s.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Mysteries, and Miguel‚Äôs Midlife Crisis

The Angels‚Äô key man, Tyler Anderson, is a mixed bag: 4.41 ERA, 87 strikeouts, and the kind of consistency that makes you wonder if he‚Äôs secretly pitching with one hand tied behind his back. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwhen your lineup includes 155 bombs and players like Taylor Ward (who could probably hit a homer into next week), you don‚Äôt need a Cy Young contender to win. You just need someone to not throw a knuckleball into the stands.

1mev6w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1mev6w4/caring_for_my_mom/,Caring for My Mom,"I am I am child of EI parents. I realized it later in life as when I was 29yo life tossed me out of my country and I moved to US. I didn‚Äôt want to but due to sequence of circumstances which are mostly were a product of emotionally immature parents, I immigrated with my ex husband and my son of 8yo. 

Since then I was able to establish new life. Divorced ex, re-married, have cats, my son is successfully integrated into life, has a great profession, earns great money, has wonderful girlfriend and lives in high end area. Myself I grew professionally and now (56yo) I am in leadership position in fantastic company full of great experts and wonderful human beings. I have all respect and support both from my team and my superiors. I am fit, eat healthy, do not drink, do not smoke, do not do any addictive substances (except coffee), exercise every day and not on meds. I support my husband who lost his job a year ago and currently fighting to get employed again while doing odd jobs. 

Every year I go to ‚Äúvacation‚Äù to visit my parents. Every time it is terrible. I feel like a POS. I can‚Äôt even eat there. I live in fight or flight mode, feeling extremely scared. Nobody beats me up but behavior of my parents does not look like anything even remotely normal. So it is either them or me. Someone is crazy. Only later I realized that I am dealing with emotionally immature people. 

After this realization everything became clear. My feeling of being a burden to them when I was a kid. Then being a matter of pride when I did well at school. Then being inconvenience when I started requiring some level of independence- my Mom needed to control my comings and goings to a minute. Then being a threat when I would come home in a great mood (how come I deal with your father‚Äôs moods and you are just‚Ä¶ happy there? Do you have any shame?)
At the same time the level of neediness - I would wake up on Saturdays with my Mom already sitting on my bed wanting me to get awake. 
I always felt I need to provide all emotional support and I always failed. Naturally. But it did a huge number on my self esteem. I never realized that in order to deal with my mom I need to push her away. I did push away my Dad and had zero to none relationship with him. My mom supported it. It never occurred to me that I needed to do pushing to some extent with her as well. Instead, I leaned on her ‚Äúlove‚Äù and this was not a good idea. As she also was emotionally immature. Only a different flavor than my Dad. 

Now I came to visit her for a month (another vacation which was accommodated by my colleagues as the job is demanding) in order to help her to recover from her sickness. She is 86 and had a flu with extreme weakness, so she had to be hospitalized. Fortunately, everything went well in terms of bringing down inflammation and now I am supporting her for a month before I leave her alone again. I have a woman who comes and helps. I was talking about spa facility for full care (I can pay). Mom is absolutely against it. I understand why. She needs to be dominant and she generally hates people. People for her are subjects for ridicule, dismissal and building herself up. For extremely rare exceptions. These exceptions do exist therefore the overall picture gets confusing. 

Sorry for spilling all this out here but the reason I started this post is that i find it is very challenging to discern craziness of emotional immaturity and dementia. People with whom my Mom communicates all say she is in her clear mind, just stubborn, withdrawn, with poor hearing. I testify that yes, Mom remembers events, all needed passwords and codes, operates her own money, her apartment is not crazy but in acceptable way organized. 

However her communication is bewildering. For example. I walk with her to a small outings to support her until she gains strength. We would sit on the bench. Not talking. I already learned that anything I say she uses either to argue or she suffers through listening. So I keep quiet. I looked at my phone and then I see her walking away from the bench in some new direction. This is so bizarre! Why not to tell me that she is taking off? What if I stared at my phone for longer and she would completely disappeared from my view??? 

And then I remembered it was always this way. With me. With Dad. She somehow assumes that all eyes are on her and everyone will follow her. I asked her today why she did not alert me that she wants to walk somewhere else? She just looked at me as I was such a high maintenance and said :‚ÄùI thought you will follow me‚Äù. I told her that I am not a dog but a human being and prefer to have communication. Yes,  I realize I want too much. 

Just so hard to adjust. I am happy she is doing better healthwise. But I am extremely challenged to operate in this dysfunctional communication environment. 

And I realize that her emotional immaturity looks like either insanity or now dementia. 

I wonder whether others also struggled to discern EI from insanity or cognitive decline?",1,1754051383.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

# Best Masculine Soap 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Masculine soap transcends mere hygiene; it's about crafting an identity, projecting confidence, and indulging in a sensory experience tailored for men. gone are the days of generic, floral-scented bars. Today's market offers a diverse array of soaps formulated with robust fragrances, invigorating ingredients, and skin-loving properties designed to meet the unique needs and preferences of the modern man. This guide explores the best masculine soaps of 2025, providing in-depth reviews and expert advice to help you make an informed decision.We delve into the essential features, benefits, and comparisons to empower you to select the perfect soap that aligns with your skin type, lifestyle, and desired olfactory profile. From rugged, earthy scents to crisp, clean aromas, discover the best masculine soaps to elevate your daily grooming routine.

## Key Features Analysis

The best masculine soaps prioritize specific attributes that cater to the demands of men's skin and sensory preferences.

**Invigorating Fragrance:** A truly masculine soap boasts a bold and sophisticated fragrance profile that avoids overly sweet or floral notes. Common scents include sandalwood, cedarwood, patchouli, citrus, spices, and musk. These fragrances are carefully selected to create a refreshing and energizing shower experience that leaves a lasting impression without being overpowering.The best soaps use natural essential oils for scent as opposed to synthetic fragrances that can irritate skin over time.

**Exfoliating Properties:** Male skin tends to be thicker and oilier than female skin,making exfoliation a crucial factor. Many masculine soaps incorporate natural exfoliants like oatmeal, sea salt, coffee grounds, or pumice to gently slough away dead skin cells, unclog pores, and prevent ingrown hairs. these exfoliating agents help to improve skin texture,leaving it smoother,brighter,and more receptive to moisturizing.Exfoliation properties can also help improve blood flow to the surface of the skin,assisting with collagen production.

**Hydrating and Moisturizing Ingredients:** while effectively cleansing, masculine soaps should also prioritize hydration and moisture retention. Key ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, olive oil, aloe vera, and glycerin work together to nourish the skin, prevent dryness, and maintain its natural barrier function. These moisturizing components ensure that the soap effectively cleanses without stripping away essential oils, leaving the skin feeling soft, supple, and cozy.**Natural and Organic Formulation:** Increasingly, men are seeking out skincare products that are free from harsh chemicals, parabens, sulfates, and artificial dyes. The best masculine soaps utilize natural and organic ingredients that are gentle on the skin and environmentally friendly. These formulations often incorporate plant-based oils, extracts, and botanicals that provide a range of beneficial properties, such as antioxidant protection, anti-inflammatory effects, and skin-soothing benefits. These natural components help safeguard the skin's delicate balance and promote healthy skin function.

**Long-Lasting Bar:** A high-quality masculine soap should be dense and durable, providing a long-lasting lather that stands up to frequent use. Shorter lasting bars often indicate lower quality ingredients that dissolve easier when introduced to water. Look for soaps that are triple-milled or cold-processed, as these methods create a firmer, more compact bar that resists melting and extends the life of the soap. Investing in a long-lasting bar ensures that you get the most value for your money and reduces the need for frequent replacements.

**Rich and Creamy Lather:** The quality of the lather is a key indicator of a soap's effectiveness and overall user experience.A luxurious,creamy lather helps to lift away dirt,oil,and impurities without stripping the skin's natural moisture. The best masculine soaps create a dense and stable lather that clings to the skin, providing a thorough and satisfying cleanse. Lather volume helps the user gauge if they‚Äôve used enough soap for adequate skin coverage.

## Core Benefits

Masculine soaps offer numerous advantages beyond basic cleansing, catering to the unique needs and preferences of men.

**Enhanced Skin Health:** A good masculine soap improves skin health by providing targeted exfoliation, hydration, and nourishment.Regular use of soap containing natural exfoliants can help to prevent ingrown hairs, reduce acne breakouts, and promote a smoother, more even skin tone. Ingredients like shea butter and aloe vera keep skin moisturized, preventing dryness and irritation, notably after shaving.

**Invigorating Shower Experience:** the bold and masculine fragrances found in these soaps elevate the daily shower routine into an energizing and refreshing experience. Scents like sandalwood and citrus awaken the senses, promoting alertness and focus. The rich lather provides a luxurious feel, leaving the skin feeling clean and revitalized.

**Boosts Confidence and Self-Esteem:** Using a high-quality masculine soap can have a positive impact on self-esteem by making you feel cleaner and more refreshed. The lingering scent can project an air of sophistication and confidence, enhancing your overall presence. Knowing that you are taking care of your skin with a product tailored to your needs contributes to a sense of well-being and self-assurance.

**Protects Against Odors:** These soaps are specifically formulated to combat body odors,with ingredients that neutralize bacteria and leave you feeling fresh throughout the day. Antibacterial agents like tea tree oil or activated charcoal help to eliminate odor-causing bacteria,providing reliable protection even during strenuous activity.**Improved Shaving Experience:** Some masculine soaps can double as shaving creams, providing a rich and lubricating lather that helps the razor glide smoothly over the skin.This reduces the risk of razor burn, nicks, and irritation, resulting in a closer, more comfortable shave.

## FAQs Section

**Are masculine soaps only for men with oily skin?**
No, masculine soaps are formulated for a variety of skin types. Look for soaps that specify ""for dry skin"" if that's your predominant skin type. While many masculine soaps have qualities such as exfoliation properties that benefit men with oily skin, soaps can be found that address other skin concerns as well.

**Can I use masculine soap on my face?**
Yes, you can use some masculine soaps on your face, but it's essential to choose one that's specifically indicated for facial use or contains gentle, non-irritating ingredients. Soaps with harsh exfoliants or strong fragrances might potentially be too abrasive for the delicate skin on the face. Always read the product label and test on a small area of skin first.

**How often should I use masculine soap?**
The frequency of use depends on your individual needs and skin type. Generally, using masculine soap once or twice a day is sufficient for most people. If you have dry skin, you may want to use it less frequently or opt for a soap with moisturizing ingredients. If you have oily skin,you may benefit from using it more often,especially after exercising or sweating.

**What is the difference between a body wash and a masculine soap bar?**
The primary difference lies in the formulation and request method. A masculine soap bar is a solid soap that is lathered with water, while a body wash is a liquid soap that is typically applied with a loofah or sponge. Soap bars tend to be more concentrated and may contain more natural ingredients, while body washes often contain added moisturizers and fragrances. The choice between the two depends on personal preference and desired benefits.## Competitor Comparison

1mev4tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaltAndCatchFire/comments/1mev4tl/just_finished_the_show_at_the_perfect_time_for_me/,Just finished the show (at the perfect time for me),"Just say hi guys just finished the show and wrote this reflection about it. I wonder if other viewers had similar thoughts:  
  
I want to start this reflection with a question: Do we actually find shows we like? Or do we like certain shows because they reflect certain truths back to us?

I remember when I was a teenager, with long summer holidays ahead of me, purchasing *Twin Peaks* on DVD. Somehow the surreal escapism and massive romanticization of the mundane (cherry pies, coffee) was exactly what I needed in that moment.

Later on, in Japan, I devoured *Mad Men* at a time when I was lost. This existential show about trying to find meaning in ads (art) that you can never find in life, even if the creation reflects the exact thing you are trying to portray, was touching. It was a time when I lived like a brain in a jar, connecting with others only through roles as a teacher or (haha) stand-up comedian.

And now, more recently, after a long hiatus from watching any kind of show, there‚Äôs *Halt and Catch Fire*. Recently, I failed as a primary school teacher and was forced to reconsider when to move forward.

It‚Äôs the perfect moment for me to try to connect with my inner Joe Macmillan, someone who perpetually walked away from everything, pressure, money, and fame, if it no longer met how he had idealized it.

My decision to leave a primary school mid-year? Suddenly, it didn‚Äôt seem so weak but more like I was no longer monopolizing myself and neglecting myself to handle the environment. It was time to choose myself, even if it meant losing something worthwhile.

Sure, I didn‚Äôt have some grand vision. Not yet. But taking steps towards it is the only way for it to emerge.

And now I‚Äôve come to the end of the show, and I‚Äôm thinking in particular about how one character seemed to have found contentment after all the reinventions and rising from the ashes of failure over and over again. With the music choice, *Solsbury Hill* playing in the background, I started thinking about one particular line in the song, ‚ÄúI walked right out of the machinery.‚Äù And how, in a way, that‚Äôs what some of us need to do to find our place in the world.

As Joe said, ‚ÄúThis is not the thing, this is the thing that gets us to the thing,‚Äù such a vague comment but also true for so many aspects of life. A job might not be the thing but the thing that gets you to the thing, so maybe think about that before quitting. Or even quit, but appreciate that all of it, all the people you knew, the connections you made, the loves you lost‚Äîthey were all part of what got you to the thing. I just hope we all find our own thing and don‚Äôt get lost on the getting-there part.

So what is ‚Äúfinding our thing?‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking of this in a Jungian sense. It reminds me of what Marie von Franz wrote about the importance of the *tertium* (the third thing, which is my individuality). Some of us never find that. We‚Äôre so hooked on what looks like the next thing, objectively based on paths put in front of us by others, that we don‚Äôt even consider a third way, as Joe finally did.

This also reminds me of Joseph Campbell: ‚ÄúIf you can see your path laid out in front of you step by step, you know it‚Äôs not your path.‚Äù You can argue that Joe had this figured out early on in his life by leaving IBM and the expectations of his family, but it took him a lot longer to understand there might be a way outside of technology entirely. ‚ÄúThe thing‚Äù that it had actually been leading him to all along was the connections, friendships, and humanity.

Let me go back to where it all began. Why this show resonated with me so much is not because I have been involved with tech in any way. No. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôve always been looking for the thing. And I still haven‚Äôt found it. But I am not looking at all my failures and collapses of careers as wrong turns, but actions which took me closer. There‚Äôs a voice in me wanting to take me home. And it just wasn‚Äôt there before. So thank you, *Halt and Catch Fire*.

Expenses like branded to-go cups, eco-friendly packaging, and other essentials were eating into my budget, with local suppliers charging premium rates for sustainable materials. My margins were razor-thin, barely covering rent, utilities, and wages for my dedicated team of baristas. I needed a solution to source affordable, high-quality packaging that aligned with my brand‚Äôs commitment to sustainability without compromising the customer experience. The pressure to maintain quality while keeping costs manageable was relentless, and I knew I had to think outside the box to keep my business thriving.



Switching to this international supplier on alibaba slashed my packaging costs by an impressive 30%. This significant reduction freed up funds that I reinvested into the business, allowing me to source higher-quality coffee beans from a local roaster and fund barista training in latte art. These improvements elevated the customer experience, leading to glowing reviews and increased loyalty from regulars who appreciated the enhanced quality. To further optimize savings, I negotiated seasonal discounts with the supplier, securing even better rates during peak periods like the holiday season. These small tweaks added up, creating a ripple effect that strengthened my business‚Äôs financial health.



The transition wasn‚Äôt without challenges. Navigating international shipping required patience, as lead times were longer than local deliveries. I also had to account for customs fees and occasional delays, which initially caused some stress. However, clear and proactive communication with the supplier helped smooth out these hiccups. To prevent stockouts. Over time, I fine-tuned the process, and now the supply chain runs seamlessly.



By taking calculated risks and leveraging technology, I was able to cut costs without sacrificing the quality or values that define my brand. The savings have given my coffee shop a competitive edge, allowing me to focus on what matters most delivering a memorable experience to my customers. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for new ways to optimize operations and would love to hear from others in the small business community.

I work at a store with shitty management, and the employees who stay long are also little pieces of shit. The manager shits on the employees, and the employees in turn shit on the newer employees. I'm one of the new people.

One day my co-worker never showed up for his shift, so the store manager had to call him a half hour in. He showed up FOUR HOURS LATER and in the meantime I was asked to work the register in lieu of him (I'm supposed to be on the floor). Our store is so high volume that there is never not a line. We sometimes have 2 or 3 registers open.

We're so short staffed that day (3 people when there's supposed to be 4-6) that customers keep asking me if they should ""come back on a better day"" because I'm SINGLEHANDEDLY working the register, handling all pickup orders, and handling most customer requests while tethered to the register because they can't find ANYONE on the floor. All because this MF couldn't bother to show up for his shift.

FOUR HOURS LATER, the co-worker finally shows up and takes his shift at the register. The first thing he does is spill someone's old coffee (which was put away in the cabinet below the register) and TRY TO SHIFT BLAME ONTO ME. ""Is that your coffee? That's the worst possible place to put your coffee."" I politely informed him I don't drink coffee and didn't even know it was there.

The store manager spends the rest of the shift harassing ME because he doesn't want to direct his hostility at the guy who showed up late. That guy has been here for two years and gets special treatment. He's also an incel POS.

Then another day I've clocked out (20 minutes late because my fucking co worker was late) and am heading to the door. We are well staffed but busy. A customer asks me for help, so I look around and notice a co-worker a few feet away and direct this person to her. She goes ""well, I'm ALREADY helping a customer"" and acts like I did something wrong. Um, you're the shift manager? Why not just radio someone else to help? It's literally your job? I'm off the clock and maybe that's why I've got my bag and I'm heading to the door?

# Core Needs

‚ÄãI noticed this year that unhappy people are often unhappy because their basic needs aren't met.

**‚ÄãVital:** poor diet (junk food), lack of sleep.

**‚ÄãSecurity:** unpredictable environment.

**‚ÄãSocial:** tragic family events, feelings of rejection, lack of affection.

**‚ÄãSelf-Esteem:** autism, introversion, overweight, sexual discomfort (e.g., being transgender).

**‚ÄãAccomplishment:** Feeling worthless, not fully utilizing your abilities.

‚ÄãThe good news is that all of this can be improved. Most often, unhappiness isn't caused by a single thing, even if we don't realize it. If one of these needs isn't fully met, even if it seems trivial, do everything you can to improve it.

**‚ÄãExercise a lot.**

Force yourself, even if you don't see the point. Believe me, it will bring you unexpected benefits. Exercising produces endorphins, which will make you happier in the long run. Motivation comes with discipline. Don't make excuses. As long as you're not seriously injured, go for it and adjust your schedule so you can always fit in a workout. To exercise a lot, you need to eat well, especially protein. Eggs are the cheapest source of protein.

**‚ÄãEat healthy.**

Force yourself too. Only eat foods with a Nutri-Score of A or B; it's fairly reliable most of the time. Avoid sugar and fat at all costs. Only if you feel unwell, eat a square of 70% dark chocolate, no more than one per day.

**Get the best sleep possible.**

Go to bed at 9 pm., put your phone in another room, out of sight. Don't use your phone as an alarm clock; buy a real one. If you don't really need one (ask a doctor or ask yourself), gradually cut out coffee (within two hours of waking up) and sleeping pills. Your body will adapt. If it doesn't need to create substances to wake you up and put you to sleep, it won't produce enough. You'll become dependent on coffee or sleeping pills. If you quit, it will take a few months for your body to return to normal, but your sleep will improve.

‚ÄãFor insomniacs like me, use this technique (used in the military):

‚Äã1. Lie flat on your back.

2. Relax all your muscles, even those in your head.

3. Don't think about anything. If you can't, think of a calm place like the sea.

4. Raise your eyes slightly and let them sink into your sockets.

5. Don't move.

**‚ÄãAddictions**

‚ÄãIf you're determined, write down on a piece of paper the reasons why you want to quit and then stop. If you don't have enough motivation, stop gradually.

If you fight your urges, you'll eventually fall. When you have one, turn your head, close your eyes, and think of a pleasant or funny place. Not thinking about it will calm your urge.

‚ÄãIf you've fallen into pornography, drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes, it's probably because you wanted to escape some form of pain (guilt, depression, stress, etc.). Pain is like the ground: you can escape it temporarily by plane, but it's always temporary; you can't escape it. However, pain isn't a bad thing; it's thanks to it that you move forward. Without pain, there is no happiness.

If you fell into it because of your friends, change your friends; having bad people isn't a big deal when things are going well; it's when things are going badly that it becomes a big deal.

# ‚ÄãSafety

**‚ÄãMoving**

Speak calmly to your parents. If you move frequently because of schools, tell yourself that you can go to any school; it won't change anything. Adapt to your current situation, no matter how difficult it is. Future Career

Tell yourself that it's not a big deal if you failed your studies. It's never too late. Do your best to have the best career possible. Observe those who succeed and see what you can change about yourself. It's all a question of mentality, and you can change yours.

**Abusive Parents**

Speak calmly to your parents. If they don't listen to you, be more aggressive, guess what's going on in their heads, and tell them what they don't want to hear. Parents aren't perfect; they're just adults with more experience. Some are afraid because of trauma and can't accept that you're successful. You know better than them, and some are just lacking or experiencing injustice and taking it out on you.

# ‚ÄãSocial

**‚ÄãTragic Event**

If you can do something about it, give it your all; speaking calmly is always the best solution. If it's irreversible, even if it's hard, accept it. Even if it's your fault, you can't change the past.

**‚ÄãAntisocial**

Before correcting a problem, you must first accept that it exists.

To get along well with others, be open (talk easily, don't isolate yourself), confident (respect yourself and be comfortable), humble (respect others, listen to them, and admit your faults), and positive (talk and put situations into perspective). If you apply these tips, everything will go well. Observe people who get along well with everyone and see what you can change about yourself. Feelings of Social Rejection

If you're too shy, talk to others more often, even if you're afraid. Your shyness will gradually disappear, I promise. But don't push yourself too hard; people can sense when you're uncomfortable. Find a balance between what you want and what others want. Don't try to attract attention or be interesting. Also, avoid talking about obscene subjects, even jokingly; it can give a bad impression of your state of mind.

**‚ÄãIf you're not nice**

Respect yourself, otherwise you won't be able to respect others. Be humble, think before you speak, admit when you're wrong and be positive, listen to others when they confide in you. Just be nice.

Don't hesitate to change your group of friends.

Seeing a psychologist is nothing to be ashamed of; if you need it, do it.

# Self-Esteem

**Autism/ADHD**

If you think you have been diagnosed with ADHD, autism, or anything else, accept it and tell yourself it's okay. Complaining won't help. You're not doomed; having autism or ADHD doesn't mean you're stupid or limited. It's just a different way of thinking. You're not worthless; it's a question of mentality. It's a bit like a person missing a leg. This disability won't be an excuse to stay at home for the rest of their life. All you have to do is find a solution, temporary or permanent. With a temporary solution (crutches), they can walk; with a permanent solution (a prosthesis), they can run, just like anyone else. If you have trouble understanding others, observe those who succeed where you fail and see what you can change about yourself. Don't seek attention. Sleep and eat as well as possible to be in good shape and react better.

**‚ÄãOverweight**

Stopping diets‚ÄîI know it's counterintuitive, but it makes you gain weight. When the body thinks food is scarce (because you haven't eaten for a long time), it stores as much fat as possible when you start eating again to optimize your chances of survival. You need to eat less, but gradually. Eat at set times: morning, noon, and evening, and only if you're hungry. Don't eat out of habit (in front of a screen, out of boredom or sadness). Don't eat anything sweet or fatty (burgers, sodas, pizzas, cakes). Choose foods with a good Nutri-Score (A or B) like vegetables, fruits, and grains (rice, wheat, pasta). Don't add salt to your meals if possible.

**‚ÄãUnderweight**

Exercise a lot. Eat a lot, even when you're not hungry, but avoid fat and sugar. Eat dairy products (calcium), fruit, meat (calories and fat), and eggs (protein).

**‚ÄãShort stature**

You haven't reached your maximum height yet. Growth stops around age 18 for girls and 21 for boys. Exercise, sleep well, and, very importantly, eat well: dairy products (calcium), eggs (protein), and meat (calories).

# ‚ÄãAchievement

It's a mindset issue. Take risks. If the risk is low and you have something to gain, do it. Believe in your goals, don't give up, don't overthink things, and act now. If you're feeling lazy, force yourself to exercise, eat well, and sleep well. If you're looking for an audience because you're not successful enough in your field, go somewhere where there are lots of people, like social media, and make short, funny videos to talk about your passion and your work.

# ‚ÄãMindset

‚ÄãIT'S ALL A MATTER OF MENTALITY WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

‚ÄãDetermination: The biggest problem for people at rock bottom is a lack of determination. They're too lazy or too fearful to take action. Stop saying it's not your fault. Even if it's true, you're not doomed. You're not worthless; have willpower. Do things even if you don't want to; that's discipline. Motivation comes with action. The more you do things you don't like, the easier it will become. I used to be very lazy, but this year I started weight training. I did it every day, even when I didn't feel like it, and it was hard. Today, I go at it effortlessly. My laziness has completely disappeared, not only for sports, but also for studying and anything that requires effort.

We are not what we are, we are what we continuously do.

**‚ÄãStop blaming others**

When we are unhappy, it's almost always because of our mentality, even if we don't realize it. We blame others, the government, society... But the truth, even if it's hard to accept, is that when everyone else is a problem, maybe you are the problem. Even if others aren't perfect, you have to change. It's easier to change yourself than to change others. Stop looking for excuses, look for solutions. As I said before, a person with one leg missing can walk on crutches and run on a prosthesis. If a monkey doesn't survive in the jungle, it's not because the jungle is too dangerous, but because it's weaker than it should be. Try to be more trusting, open, humble, and kind, and you'll be fine with others.

**‚ÄãThe pursuit of happiness**

Many people see happiness as a goal, but they often focus on short-term happiness: junk food, pornography, entertainment, comfort. True happiness is found in long-term things that aren't initially pleasant: sports, reading, activities with friends. Don't see happiness as a goal. Instead, ask yourself, ""What pain am I willing to go through to achieve it?"" ¬ª

**‚ÄãThe future matters more than the past**

80% of suicidal people don't want to die, but just to stop suffering. Even if your current situation is terrible, stop complaining and do your best to change it. If you already think you're trying everything, it's because you're not determined enough or you're not doing it the right way. The solution is sometimes right in front of you. The future matters more than the past and the present. Move forward without looking back. Feeling like a loser or having a bad experience isn't a problem; the problem is staying that way.

**‚ÄãMental Limits**

Our life experience helps us progress, but it can also block us. Sometimes our past life limits us and prevents us from understanding certain things, changing our minds, or applying simple solutions. Just because your life has been hard up to now doesn't mean it always will be. Take risks, think differently without considering your limits, and don't be afraid to try something new, even if it didn't work for you before. You've changed in the meantime, even in a few weeks. At the end of your life, you'll regret more what you didn't do than what you did.

**‚ÄãNegativity**

Be positive. If you're convinced that everything will go wrong, everything will go wrong. But if you're convinced that you'll succeed, if you're determined and give your all, there's a good chance you'll succeed. Even if you're at a disadvantage, some people with intellectual disabilities have managed to learn to write, others with physical disabilities play sports, thanks to their iron mentality. Realize how lucky you are. Your situation could have been so much worse: born in a poor country, with crime, having bad parents, being born with Down syndrome, or committing suicide. But you live in a rich country, with freedom. Most people don't realize how lucky they are.

Change takes time. You won't change in a few days or weeks; it takes months, or even years. But believe me, it's worth it because you'll be happy for the rest of your life.

I‚Äôm not saying *no one* uses them anymore, but more and more of my friends‚Äîand people I talk to‚Äîare just over it. Like, fully tapped out. And honestly? I get it.

*Here‚Äôs what I think is going on:*

# 1. The Vibes Are Off.

Dating apps used to feel exciting. Now they‚Äôre just... stale. Endless swiping, small talk that leads nowhere, and way too many dead conversations. It‚Äôs starting to feel like work, not fun. Most people I know just want something real, not another ‚Äúwyd‚Äù at 11pm.

# 2. Algorithms Can‚Äôt Fake Chemistry.

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîno app is gonna know your vibe. You can match with someone who looks great on paper (or on-screen), but meet up and there‚Äôs *nothing.* No spark. No flow. Meanwhile, the person you actually vibe with could be sitting two seats down at a local open mic night.

# 3. Real-life Just Hits Different Now.

After years of being glued to our phones (shoutout to the pandemic), a lot of us are craving real eye contact. Like, that *accidental glance across the room* kinda thing. Meeting someone through a friend or at an event feels way less awkward now than starting cold in an app chat.

# 4. We're Tired Of The Fake Version Of People.

Everyone‚Äôs putting their best filtered self forward online, but IRL? You get to see the quirks, the awkward laughs, the nervous gestures. It‚Äôs just more *real*. You can‚Äôt edit your way through a conversation at a coffee shop.

# 5. People Are Meeting Through Hobbies Again.

I know folks who met playing pickleball, at improv classes, even in co-working spaces. Not even trying to date‚Äîjust being out in the world. And boom. Connection. There‚Äôs something about bonding over a shared activity that makes things feel natural.

# 6. It‚Äôs Better For Our Brains, Honestly.

Dating apps kinda mess with your head. One minute you're getting matches and feeling good, the next you're getting ghosted and questioning everything. It's a cycle a lot of people are stepping away from. Mental health first, ya know?

**Anyway‚ÄîTL;DR:**

Gen Z isn‚Äôt ditching dating apps out of nowhere. We‚Äôre just leaning more into stuff that feels *authentic*. You might still keep the apps around, but real-life interactions are making a serious comeback. And it‚Äôs kinda refreshing.

Anyone else feel the same? Curious how others are meeting people these days.",1,1754051030.0,u_Thomas96354752,0,1.0,False

New to van life and want to buy my first van to convert. My user case is to use the van for day use rather than overnight camping. We often venture out to forests and ares of interest but like the idea of being able to use the van as a base to feed the kids have a coffee and a sit down and if needed retreat from the elements. 

What‚Äôs tricky is I have 2 kids ages 2 and 1 month old so I use 2 car seats. I‚Äôm struggling to find a setup which allows me to have both car seats in the car and have a good enough space left over. 

I would like to be able to stand up in the van too. I have seen ford transit custom do a multi cab variety which has 2 seats in the back but can‚Äôt really find them used. 

I‚Äôm probably going to finance the van but budget would be around 10-15k as this will be my main runabout to. Wife already has our actual main car so this I‚Äôm flexible when it comes to what I drive. Current an d fiesta :/

Anyone had a similar user case or have suggestions.

Would love some advice here.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brewers vs. Nationals: A Tale of Two Teams (and Why Milwaukee‚Äôs Pitching Won‚Äôt Let You Down)**

The Milwaukee Brewers (64-44) and Washington Nationals (44-64) are set to collide at Nationals Park on August 1, 2025, in what promises to be a game as lopsided as a tippedÂï§ÈÖí mug at a bar. The Brewers, baseball‚Äôs version of a well-polished espresso machine, are favored at -154, implying a 60% chance to win. The Nationals, meanwhile, are +232 underdogs‚Äîroughly the odds of me understanding a umpire‚Äôs explanation of a called third strike. Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet-obsessed fanboy and the humor of a comedy writer who‚Äôs seen too many rain delays.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Brewers Are the Statistical Choice

The Brewers‚Äô implied probability (60%) is backed by a 34-19 record in games they‚Äôre favored, plus a top-five team ERA (3.20) and a WHIP so low, it‚Äôs probably wearing a tuxedo. Their offense, eighth in the majors at 4.8 runs per game, is like a steady drip of coffee‚Äîreliable, never overwhelming, but always there.

The Nationals? Their 40% underdog win rate (37-55 in 92 games) is about as impressive as a toddler‚Äôs attempt to parallel park. With a 5.10 ERA and a WHIP higher than a skyscraper, their pitching staff is a sieve held together by duct tape and hope. Their offense? A meager 4.3 runs per game‚Äîthink of it as a team of polite guests who refuse to raid the snack table.

The moneyline (-154 for Milwaukee) suggests you‚Äôd need a time machine to bet on Washington and win. The spread (-1.5 for the Brewers) is basically a heads-up: the Nationals aren‚Äôt just losing; they‚Äôre losing by *at least two runs*. And the total (9 runs, under favored) hints at a pitchers‚Äô duel‚Ä¶ or a mercy rule waiting to happen.

1mev0hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/1mev0hy/the_tragedy_of_indias_governmentjob_prep_towns/,The Tragedy of India‚Äôs Government-Job Prep Towns,"In [Massive Rent-Seeking in India‚Äôs Government Job Examination System](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/07/massive-rent-seeking-in-indias-government-job-examination-system.html) I argued that the high value of government jobs has distorted India‚Äôs entire labor market and educational system.

> India‚Äôs most educated young people‚Äîprecisely those it needs in the workforce‚Äîare devoting years of their life cramming for government exams instead of working productively. These exams cultivate no real-world skills; they are pure sorting mechanisms, not tools of human capital development. But beyond the staggering economic waste, there is a deeper, more corrosive human cost. As Rajagopalan and I have argued, India suffers from&nbsp;[premature imitation](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_24_2_01_rajagopalan.pdf): In this case, India is producing Western-educated youth without the economic structure to employ them. In one survey, 88% of grade 12 students preferred a government job to a private sector job. But these jobs do not and cannot exist. The result is disillusioned cohorts trained to expect a middle-class, white-collar lifestyle, convinced that only a government job can deliver it. India is thus creating large numbers of educated young people who are inevitably disillusioned‚Äìthat is not a sustainable equilibrium.

The Economist has an [excellent piece on the lives of the students](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2025/07/24/would-you-pass-the-worlds-toughest-exam) including Kumar who is studying in ‚ÄúMusallahpur Haat, a suburb of Patna where dozens of coaching centers were concentrated, and the rent was cheap.‚Äù

> ‚Ä¶About half a million students are currently preparing for government exams in Musallahpur‚Ä¶.For most government departments the initial tests are similar, and have little direct bearing on the job in question. Would-be ticket inspectors and train-drivers must answer multiple-choice questions on current affairs, logic, maths and science. They might be asked who invented JavaScript, or which element is most abundant in the Earth‚Äôs crust, or the smallest whole number for _a_&nbsp;if&nbsp;_a_456 is divisible by 11. Students have no idea when their preparations might be put to use; exams are not held on a fixed schedule.
> 
> ‚Ä¶Kumar made his way to the bare, windowless room his friend had arranged for him to rent and started working. Every few days, he‚Äôd check the Ministry of Railways website to see if a date had been set for the exams. The days turned into weeks, then months. When the covid pandemic erupted he adjusted his expectations ‚Äì obviously there would be delays. The syllabus felt infinite and he kept studying, shuttling between libraries, revision tutorials and mock test sessions. Before he knew it he‚Äôd been in Musallahpur nearly six years.
> 
> As his 30s approached, Kumar began to worry about running out of time. There is an upper age limit for the railway exams ‚Äì for the ones Kumar was doing it was set at 30. As a lower-caste applicant he was allowed to extend this deadline by three years. His parents urged him to start thinking about alternative careers, but he convinced them to be patient. His father, who was struggling to keep up the allowance, reluctantly sold some of the family‚Äôs land to help support him, and Kumar studied harder and longer.

In my post, I emphasized the above-average wages and privileges, which is true enough, but even by Indian standards many of the jobs aren‚Äôt great and [The Economist](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2025/07/24/would-you-pass-the-worlds-toughest-exam) puts more focus on respectability and prestige (the sad premature imitation I discussed):

> Indian society accords public-sector jobs a special respect. Grooms who have them are able to ask for higher dowries from their brides‚Äô families. ‚ÄúIf you are at a wedding and say you have a government job, people will look at you differently,‚Äù said Abhishek Singh, an exam tutor in Musallahpur.
> 
> Railway jobs in particular still have a vestigial glow of prestige.
> 
> ‚Ä¶[Kumar] had been preparing for junior engineer and assistant train-driver jobs, but decided to apply for the lowest rung of positions too, the Group D roles, to increase his chance of getting something. An undergraduate degree and six years studying in Patna could lead to him becoming a track-maintenance worker. ‚ÄúI never imagined it would come to this,‚Äù he said sadly.
> 
> And yet he wouldn‚Äôt trade it. A short drive from his room in Musallahpur, a glitzy mall has just been built. There are jobs going there which pay close to what he might earn in a Group D role. But Kumar baulked at the suggestion he might become a barista. ‚ÄúI am educated with a technical degree,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy family hasn‚Äôt sacrificed so much for me to work in a coffee shop. People only work there if they have no other choice.‚Äù No one from his parents‚Äô generation would respect a barista. But they admired, or at least understood, a job on the railways.

India‚Äôs government job system squanders talent, feeds on obsolete and socially-inefficient prestige hierarchies, and rewards years of sterile preparation with diminishing returns. It‚Äôs inefficient, of course, but behind the scenes it‚Äôs devastating to the young.

I've been going to office everyday (cuz I like to) I haven't made any acquaintance yet, its weird. In all my previous companies, I would've at least gone out once for coffee or a smoke with my colleagues during work but not here. I have a great difficulty in starting conversations with strangers especially in person, but someone would've asked me to go with them to cafeteria or somewhere for a chat. But the colleagues don't look like they're super introverts as I can see them talking to everyone and of course go off in groups. I cannot help but think if it is because of my skin color or that I'm from southern part of India or that I don't speak hindi fluently (I do understand hindi and can hold conversation but I prefer english as its easier in flow), and its not like the colleagues don't speak english, they do really well.

TLDR I bought a $50 250g bag of beans in San Diego because the name of the roast was (almost) the same as a soccer player I grew up watching. ",35,1754050724.0,pourover,36,1.0,False

1meuwwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1meuwwk/changes_to_relationship_after_getting_sober/,Changes to relationship after getting sober?,"46F, 47M, together 7 years, living together 3 years. Partner drinks very infrequently and when he does, does so responsibly. 

TLDR: I stopped drinking and am having small but almost daily conflict with partner. We are both annoyed a lot and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs me not drinking or‚Ä¶? And not sure if this is common or what to do. 

I have ADHD, CPTSD and am in perimenopause so kind of ragey even on HRT. For the last few years, I‚Äôve ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù my symptoms by drinking copious amounts of coffee half the day to calm the ADHD so I can work and then switching to alcohol later in the day to tamp down anxiety and the peri irritability and get to sleep. After I got laid off this spring (thanks tariffs!) I began skipping the coffee and basically drinking all day. Not good.

About 6 weeks ago, I cut out alcohol entirely. I am sleeping better and have more energy which is great.

However, my partner feels like I am constantly annoyed by him, looking to point out that he‚Äôs wrong about things, think he‚Äôs stupid, and am giving him ‚Äúlooks‚Äù. Just about any interaction lately ends with him saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say/do anything right. I don‚Äôt know why I bother‚Äù and him retreating to gaming. 

To be fair, I AM annoyed. The house is his and it looks like a hoarder house. It stresses me out. There are 3 rooms in the house that I kind of ‚Äúown‚Äù and keep tidy and clean: master bath, kitchen, and my home office. I won‚Äôt even go in the living room and our bedroom looks like a bomb exploded. I do most of the cooking which I enjoy. I take care of all of the dog stuff though one of the dogs is his.

What annoys me is that I‚Äôll be cleaning or cooking or running errands and he‚Äôs gaming or napping. Or I‚Äôll be in the middle of something and he comes into the room and starts some random project and is in my way/making a mess or he interrupts me to show me a stupid reel or something while I‚Äôm literally cooking and listening to a book. 

He has ADHD (completely unmanaged) so he jumps from one thing to another and doesn‚Äôt finish anything. So he‚Äôll pull out all sorts of tools or whatever and then just abandons the stuff when his ‚Äúgame break‚Äù is over. Or if I ask for help with thing A, he gets distracted and starts working on thing B. 

Example: I was having trouble with the dishwasher. Asked him to look at it. We have a new dishwasher in the garage and have had it for months but he hasn‚Äôt installed it. He came in to look and then? Got his tape measure and started talking about a full kitchen renovation project. I was trying to make dinner and he was in my way and jabbering about plans‚Äîhe‚Äôs had these ‚Äúplans‚Äù since I met him. 

Anyway‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt remember being this annoyed before. And I do think I‚Äôm maybe being more short with him because without booze on board, I‚Äôm way more type A and just want to get on with things. It even feels like he talks too slowly. His stories take forever, he loses his track of mind, and in my head I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúget to the point!‚Äù

It also feels like maybe I‚Äôm being more direct and he is taking it a different way and I am baffled. 

Example: he took a nap after work. He woke up while I was making dinner. Came out and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make a ton of food, I‚Äôm not that hungry.‚Äù I said ‚Äúokay. Should be good as I only prepared a serving and a half of shrimp.‚Äù His reply ‚Äúshrimp isn‚Äôt going to fill me up.‚Äù Me ‚ÄúWell then this should work out well.‚Äù And then he got mad and said I was picking a fight. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So it could be I need to adjust my hormones again but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experienced this after getting sober? It‚Äôs literally every interaction lately. This is NOT our normal. 

It has been a rough year. I lost my horse of 33 years, got laid off, lost my dog, we lost my MIL, he‚Äôs got some health issues, money is tight (I am the breadwinner), I quit drinking, and recently one of our dogs was really sick. So lots going on and maybe that‚Äôs part of it too. 

Any help appreciated.
