I met this person on a dating app, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. But when we met at a coffee shop, something surprising happened‚Äîwe actually *talked*. Not small talk, but real, honest conversations. We shared stories, dreams, and things that usually don‚Äôt come up on the first date.

The best part? I wasn‚Äôt nervous at all. Normally, I overthink everything, but this time it felt easy, like we‚Äôd known each other forever. After a couple of hours, we even took a walk in the park, still chatting away.

It wasn‚Äôt some magical moment, but it made me realize that dating doesn‚Äôt have to be stressful. It‚Äôs about being yourself and seeing if the connection clicks, no pressure.

Anyone else had a date that felt different like this? How do you keep dating fun without overthinking? Let me know!",2,1731305242.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

They Didn't Tell Me For 6 Weeks Even Though I Was Suspicious. Where Do I Go From Here? ,"So, a while a go my partner, Taylor, and I decided to try and make some new friends. Many of our friends had moved away and we were both struggling with feeling socially isolated. One of the people we were introduced to is named Sam. At first, Taylor and I hung out with Sam a few times in groups. Everyone was friendly and I was excited. Taylor started to hang out with Sam a little one on one, which I thought was cool, though I wanted to have that opportunity to hang out with Sam as well. When Taylor's cat was sick I was out of town and Sam helped Taylor. I thought it was sweet. 

A few weeks later Taylor and I were having trouble, getting into fights. Taylor said they wanted space. While they took this space they started hanging out with Sam a lot more. I noticed how quickly Taylor and Sam's emotional bond seemed to be growing. There was one specific week where Taylor hung out with Sam 5 out of 7 days. During these hang outs, some hurtful things happened. 

The first was that Taylor said they were going to a concert. I asked if I could come too. They said they wanted to go alone. I was sad but accepted this. Then the day of the concert they told me that they actually were going with Sam. Apparently they had originally invited Sam, but Sam had been busy. When Sam's plans got cancelled, they wanted to go. Taylor wanted to honor their original invite. I was hurt because this means that Taylor did not originally want to go alone, they wanted to go with Sam. I asked if since it was a group thing now I could go too, but Taylor said they were only comfortable going with Sam. This hurt me and made me feel excluded. 

The next day was the first day all week that Taylor and I got quality time together, which was reassuring and I was grateful for. But as we were getting ready to go to bed, Taylor rushed out of our apartment. They texted me and said that they were on the phone with Sam, because Sam had had an emergency. It was 12:30am so I was concerned about Taylor being alone on the streets outside, especially because we live in an urban area. I also was worried about Sam, since I had no context about what the emergency was. I waited to hear more but an hour went by. I couldn't sleep, since I was worried. I texted Taylor to ask if they could let me know they were ok. They didn't respond. I waited another 30 minutes and sent a few more unanswered texts. Finally I went outside to look for them to see if they were okay. When I saw them down the street, they were on the phone and laughing, which surprised me because it didn't seem to match up with the energy of an emergency. When Taylor walked past me without acknowledging me, I called after them and asked, ""did you see my texts?"". They waved me off with their hand. This stunned me and I felt so hurtful. When they came back inside, I explained the hurt and anxiety I felt. They explained that they were focused on being there for Sam. Apparently Sam had lost some jewelry that were family heirlooms (but Sam found the jewelry the next day) and Taylor was the first person who responded to their texts. I felt suspicious because the phone call was so long, when it was so late at night. Taylor tried to assure me. They said that they had no romantic feelings for Sam. I asked them point blank if they would tell me if they had romantic feelings for someone else. They said yes. I asked them point blank if they would tell me if someone else had feelings for them and they knew, they said yes. 

I tried to trust them and take their word, but their feelings and connection to Sam seemed very strong. A couple days later, Sam invited Taylor to go out the bars with a group of friends. Taylor told me they were considering whether or not they'd be comfortable bringing me along. They said that because of the anxiety, insecurity, and suspiciousness I was feeling about Sam and the conflicts we'd had about it, that they weren't sure they were comfortable bringing me. I said that I wanted to be included and that we could discuss what boundaries would be needed for them to feel comfortable. I cried and felt powerless. I tried to explain that as Taylor's partner I wanted to be able to meet new people and have fun experiences with them. They said they understood but ultimately chose to go without me. 

Feeling very hurt by this, I tried again to bring up the insecurity I was feeling. There were other things I was noticing that were making me feel insecure- Sam and Taylor texted everyday, pretty constantly. Taylor was taking time to watch Sam's favorite movies, Sam had given Taylor several gifts that Taylor had put out around the apartment and clearly treasured. I asked about all of this but Taylor either explained it as nothing to worry about it, or got defensive and claimed they felt like I was putting pressure on them and trying to control their friendship. I never tried to stop Taylor from seeing Sam. 

When I brought up my insecurity and hurt the night after Taylor went out to the bars, Taylor got upset. The conversation quickly turned to conflict. They said they were leaving to take some space but wouldn't tell me where or who with. When I said that secrecy about plans was against my boundaries and values in the relationship, they doubled down that they weren't comfortable telling me because of the conflict that had already occurred. I found out later that they went to a special yoga event with Sam. Taylor even admitted that it was the kind of event I would have loved to go to. 

Despite all of this I wanted to be empathetic towards Taylor and supportive of their friendship with Sam. I wanted to overcome my insecurity and my jealousy. I wanted us all to be able to be friends. I understood that my jealousy and anxiety had made Taylor uncomfortable and had made them feel unsupported. I knew that I'd been asking them for too much reassurance and that I needed to reassure myself. Which is why I decided to try and start my own friendship with Sam. I tried to make plans with Sam. They were responsive but rainchecked on me the first time due to feeling tired. I understood. 

We met up for coffee and took a walk around their neighborhood eventually. I thought we had a good conversation and I stayed focused on building my own relationship with Sam; I didn't bring up any of my conflicts with Taylor, and only spoke about Taylor briefly in a positive light. I explained to Sam the importance of building new connections with people at this point in my life, and how I admired the supportive friendship they'd been building with Taylor. 

A couple days later I texted Sam to follow up and they were cool towards me. Taylor went to hang out with them that same night and came back upset, saying that Sam was acting differently towards them, like a wall was up. A few days later Taylor went to talk with Sam and clear the air. When Taylor came back they explained that Sam had a lot going on in their life right now and that they might need to pull back socially. They said that Sam had a lot going on at work and had some people in their life who they were anticipating losing. I expressed empathy towards Sam. 

After that the frequency of Taylor and Sam's hangs slowed and I brought up my insecurities less. There were still things that gave me pause, like Taylor and Sam's texting frequency, and Sam's gift giving (like sending soup via doordash when Taylor was sick) but for the most part I let it go to focus on connecting with Taylor. I tried to keep connecting with Sam as well, but they rainchecked on me again. When I tried to reschedule, Sam said that they probably weren't going to have capacity for the rest of the month, due to the work stress and personal grief they were dealing with. I offered understanding. 

Not long after that there was a Halloween party that all three of us were invited to. It was the first time that all three of us were going to hang out since all of this drama occured. I was nervous that Sam and Taylor would be glued at the hip the whole party and that my anxiety would spike. But the opposite happened. Taylor was loving towards me and Sam seemed to make an extra effort to be nice to me. I figured the extra time Sam and I spent talking was due in part to feeling bad about rainchecking our plans, and it honestly meant a lot to me that they seemed interested in spending some time with me at the party. But when the party was over and we went home, Taylor was upset. They said that Sam had barely interacted with them all night and that Sam's affect at the party didn't match the rapport they had one on one. I tried to comfort Taylor and assure them that they couldn't of done anything wrong. 

Sam apparently texted Taylor a few days after and said that they needed space from Taylor, not because Taylor had done anything wrong, but because Sam was feeling triggered by previous events in their life and needed time to process. Last week Taylor and Sam met to talk about what had happened at the party. Taylor came back and explained that they believed their friendship with Sam would be okay and that they had cleared the air. I asked what had happened and they said they wanted to process the conversation more before they told me. This spiked my anxiety and I took some space that night. The next day Taylor offered to set a time to talk about it and be transparent with me, but not till the following week (they wanted to wait till after the election). I explained I felt it would be hard to be connected with them until there was transparency, but accepted that I could not make them tell me before they were ready. 

The day after the election I felt very lonely and sad. I didn't want to be alone while processing this, but Taylor had plans to see Sam that night. Taylor and Sam were going to watch a movie. It sounded really nice and I was sad I couldn't join. I asked Taylor if there was any way in the future I could join and that the three of us could do things together. I didn't ask them to change their plans that night, just asked about the future. Taylor said that the last time we did all share space, the Halloween party, it didn't go so well. This made me feel like I was being blamed for what happened between Taylor and Sam- but I didn't even know what happened between them. 

A few days after that Taylor finally said we should clear the air about Sam. They told me that weeks ago (6 weeks to be exact because I checked the dates), after Sam and I had gotten coffee and then Sam seemingly had a wall go up, that Sam had told Taylor that more was going on then just work and personal grief. Apparently, Sam had also disclosed that they had a crush on Taylor. Their rapport and emotional bond was clearly strong and for Sam it had ventured into the territory of attraction and romance. Sam only realized how wrong this was after hanging out with me. Apparently when they got coffee with me, Sam's conscious kicked in and they remembered it was against their values to like or pursue someone who was already in a monogamous relationship. Sam also said that they could tell I loved Taylor very much. Feeling guilty, Sam pulled away a bit from Taylor. Then, when Sam and Taylor did talk, Sam explained that in order to continue being friends there would need to be some physical boundaries, and they both agreed to no touching beyond hugging. At the Halloween party, Taylor and Sam were both feeling a bit awkward and hyper aware of each other, which caused the vibe to be off between them. This reminded Sam of times in their life when people behaved inauthentically and made them believe their relationship was something it wasn't. 

This disclosure brought up so much emotion in me to learn. I felt foolish because my intuition had been telling me that there must be feelings stronger than friendship at play, I had suspected for a while that Sam might have a crush on Taylor or vice versa but since Taylor got so upset at my insecurity and jealousy, I had been made to feel that my intuition was crazy, off-base, and unfounded. I had been trying to connect with Sam and feeling rebuffed, now I know their feelings for Taylor might be partially to blame. I had asked Taylor outright to tell me if something like this happened, and they didn't tell me for weeks, leading me to feel not only that there had been lies by omission and a lack of transparency, but also betrayal. I feel uncomfortable knowing that my partner has spent so much close one on one time with someone who has deep, non platonic feelings for them. By not telling me about Sam's crush, Taylor denied me the opportunity to ask for any boundaries so that I could feel safe, comfortable, and reassured. I would not have stopped Taylor from being friends with Sam. Crushes sometimes happen, even on our friends, and I am not judging Sam for having those feelings. But the lack of transparency, the indirect communication, and the invalidation of my feelings have made me feel so so so so hurt in a way that I don't know how to communicate about productively or move past.

What can I do now to ask for appropriate boundaries with Taylor? Would a conversation with Sam be helpful? How can I express my hurt and facilitate the repair that I deserve without pushing Taylor further away?",1,1731305221.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

**AITAH for how I reacted when my niece announced she was engaged?**

&#x200B;

I (33m) have a pretty big age difference with my brother (44m). He had a child at 25, which means that I became an uncle at 14. Because we were pretty close in age, I formed a special bond with my niece, Ella (now 18f).

When she was 16, my brother and his family moved away so I've been seeing them less recently, but we keep in touch and catch up at family events.

Last year, at Christmas, my niece told me that she had a boyfriend and told me a bit about him, but I didn't know the guy. He was invited for Easter and a couple of other events, but was never able to make it. When we were planning our mother's birthday, my brother decided to invite Ella's boyfriend so that we could all meet him.

Yesterday was the birthday. I was looking forward to meeting Mark (Ella's boyfriend), but was very confused when I saw her walk in with a man that looked double her age (spoiler alert: he is). She introduced him to me, and I politely smiled but was deep down very concerned. I went to my brother to ask how old Mark was and he told me that Mark is 36, so literally double Ella's age. She had told me that he was ""a bit older"" but I assumed like early to mid twenties, not almost 40. That's when they called us in the living room to share ""exciting news"". Ella showed us a ring and revealed that they were engaged.

I just said ""what the fuck"" and everyone turned around and looked at me like I was crazy. I told them that they were out of their minds if they thought this was normal, that there was no world in which a 30 something should date an 18yo, and that she shouldn't be getting married. All of them accused me of ruining Ella's happiness. Some even said that I was jealous of Mark, which is so fucking disgusting I can't even explain it. I mean, I'm younger than Mark, but never in a million years would I ever consider dating someone younger than 25. They told me that it was perfectly legal as they were both adults, which isn't true because they've been dating for a year and Ella turned 18 7 months ago, and that if they were happy that's all that matters.

I told them that they were sick for allowing this and that he was a predator but they wouldn't listen. I know this isn't my business, but I can't help but fear for Ella. She is young and doesn't really know what she's getting into. I'm really scared of her getting married and being unable to leave him when she realizes how sick it was. I then left and slammed the door, and have been receiving pretty wild messages and calls since then. I don't know if I was wrong for this and am just overreacting, and if I wasn't wrong I don't know what I can do to make them realize how wrong it is. AITAH?

*A 35 year old going after a 17 year old is ick. They are just too far apart in life experiences and station in life to have a relationship based on mutual respect and equalty. These types of relationships are usually based on mutual exploitation (he gets a PYT, she gets access to material benefits not usually earned by people in her age group) and that is not a great way thing to base a relationship on.*

*I know I am generalizing, and there are cases of true and helthy love between people with this kind of age gap, but my reaction is the same as yours.*

*This likely puts you on the outs with your family, but someone had to say what you said*

**Crabbie\_one\_5443**

*All of this but I would add. Op tell Ella you are sorry for how you reacted but that you were in shock. Tell her if you two are really meant to be marriage can wait. Go to collage and get some life experiences that will help her to be the best wife she can be.*

*Hopefully the delay will break them up and save a divorce lawyer. Offer to have her go to school near you. Even offer financial help if you can. The idea is to get her away from the guy and around people her own age. Break them up indirectly. If you do it directly they will try and show you how wrong you are.*

**Update - 1 day later**

&#x200B;

If you didn't see my previous post, here's a tl;dr: my niece is 18 and getting married with a man who's 36. They started dating when she was 17. When she announced she was engaged I said that it was wrong that he was so much older than her, but everyone else found it okay.

So I've taken the past 24h to really reflect on all of this, I tried to take in most of the advice in the comments, and here's what I have decided. I don't think that me telling her and everyone that the relationship is weird was wrong, I do however think that I did it wrong and it was pretty harsh because it was in the heat of the moment. But I still find this very creepy and don't think she should get married.

What I've decided to do is:

Apologize to her. I sent her a text saying I was sorry for my outburst and that I should've thought it through beforehand. I told her that I never wanted to make her feel like I didn't want her to be happy, and that I loved her very much and had her best interests in mind.

Ask her if we could talk about this. I asked if she would be okay and free to hang out and maybe get coffee this week to talk about all of this with a clear head. I really want to try and get her to see why it's weird and that maybe marrying him is not a great choice.

Explain myself to my brother. I sent him a text saying that I was sorry for the way I said it, but that I still thought that it needed to be said. I explained to him why I think Mark is a predator and this relationship could have a very negative and damaging impact on Ella.

I'm still waiting on their replies. I'll update when they reply, or when I see Ella (if she accepts), depending on how long it would take.

In the meantime, I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice and was constructive, and really tried to help my niece out of this situation. I also send my best to all of the people in the comments sharing similar stories when they were the teenager getting groomed. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you're doing better now.

*I was the stupid 18 year-old with a 32 year-old. It turned out poorly. But at the time I thought he was the love of my life and nobody could have told me otherwise.*

*The apology good. Just let her know that you love her and will be there for her. Be nice to him, if you can stomach it, so she never has to choose between you. Maybe she‚Äôll get lucky and it will be happily ever after. But if it isn‚Äôt, she may need a support system.*

*My mom's 46 and my dad is 60, I'm not sure how old they were when they met but they've been married a long time. Before I was born(I'm 21). She's been a SAHM every since they got together. She's expressed interest in working several times but he never let her. She's completely dependent on him. He's done loads of shit that she's had to put up with for years because she's dependent on him. I'm not saying this is how your niece's relationship will go, but unfortunately I've realized this is the norm for relationships with huge age gaps. It's about control. I hope her relationship doesn't go this route, but be there for her throughout the relationship, just in case it does she'll have someone to turn to.*

&#x200B;

**Dapper\_Entry746**

*That sucks so much. It's definitely something to watch out for in age gap relationships. Hopefully your mom can find a better life without him sooner than later. It would suck to have to restart your life in your 40's (I'm mid 40's too) but it sucks less than having it stay shitty for decades.*

*My parents are 12 years apart and got married at 20 & 32. They're still happily together but my mom almost left my dad when she was 5 years older than your mom is now. My dad had started becoming emotionally abusive and even though my mom had never done more than intermittent or substitute elementary school teaching (although that can be very demanding job it doesn't pay great), she was gonna leave & figure out how to do it on her own without him. It was a scary time in her life. Starting over is scary. Escaping abuse is scary. Wishing y'all the best of outcomes.*

*(In kinda good news my dad had started becoming abusive due to personality changes from a medical condition. After getting diagnosed and corrected (and almost dying after surgery) he went back to the wonderful person he truly was. Almost 80 and trying to tear up the pickleball courts when he's not cheering my mom on ‚ò∫)*

&#x200B;

**\[deleted\]**

*I'm glad your dad was diagnosed and able to get help. I feel like maybe my dad has some undiagnosed issues, but knowing him he'll never get evaluated or accept that something may be wrong. What makes me thing he may have some undiagnosed issues is his obsession with control. I literally cannot talk to my mother without him wanting to know what I said to her. Me or any of my siblings. It's like his ears are always peeled. It could be the most unimportant thing, he'll insist my mother tell him what me or my siblings say. It's like he just doesn't feel right if he's not in the know of every little thing, no matter how unimportant.*

&#x200B;

**Dapper\_Entry746**

*It must have been very difficult to figure out yourself growing up. Honestly you're still growing up, maturing and shaping yourself into the person you'll become. (Shaping your life into a life that works for you is a constantly evolving process) Figuring what you can control in your life and healthy boundaries so you are not hurt nor do you purposefully hurt others, is difficult and messy. It's ok to make mistakes as long as we learn from them.*

*Trying to control things that are outside of our control is like being mad at the rain for being wet. You just got to remember to close your windows and grab your umbrella. Maybe check you're not wearing socks with sandals (Unless you like wet socks lol)*

*I hope you and your siblings have a good support network (separately or together)*

I order take out once a week, I cook pretty much everything I eat, I have one coffee a day which is the only thing I drink with calories. 

I guess I‚Äôm confused because the first 10 pounds came off fine but I‚Äôm hoping to lose around 140 more and it‚Äôs odd to seem like I‚Äôm stalling so soon. Again, just wondering if it‚Äôs a myth that being heavier means you automatically lose weight faster. Also to add, i‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 if that matters and I‚Äôve had a metabolic test done that said my metabolism is normal. No thyroid or hormonal issues either. If you‚Äôve had a similar experience and either pushed through it, are pushing through it, or have any tips I would love to hear it",1,1731304837.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

Another way to release dopamine is through **setting small goals and achieving them.** It's best to write it on a paper at the beginning of the day and make them specific. E.g. I will read 5 pages of my textbook by 4 pm and I will do this at my desk without getting distracted.

Instead of getting your dopamine fix from corn, do it in these healthy ways. I recommend **Mcaffeine's coffee facewash**. **Bombay Shaving Company's coffee facewash** is also good. These are just the coffee facewashes I use, you can use the brand and type you prefer.

1gol8a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gol8a4/the_ultimate_guide_to_decorating_small_spaces/,The Ultimate Guide to Decorating Small Spaces,"When you‚Äôre living in a compact space, creating a cozy, functional, and stylish environment can seem challenging. However, with a few smart design tips and the right [home decor items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), even the tiniest rooms can make a big impact. Here‚Äôs your ultimate guide to decorating small spaces in a way that maximizes style without compromising on comfort.

**1. Embrace Multifunctional Furniture**

When it comes to small spaces, every inch counts. One of the most practical room decoration items for small homes is multifunctional furniture. Look for pieces that offer multiple uses, such as a sofa that converts into a bed, a coffee table with built-in storage, or an ottoman that doubles as extra seating. By choosing pieces that serve multiple functions, you reduce clutter and maximize the usability of your space.

**2. Use Vertical Space to Your Advantage**

In a small room, the floor space may be limited, but don‚Äôt overlook your walls. Utilizing vertical space with shelves, hanging plants, or wall-mounted storage solutions can free up valuable floor area. Floating shelves, for instance, are ideal home decor items for displaying books, plants, or decorative accents without consuming floor space. Opt for taller furniture like bookcases or storage cabinets that go up rather than out to make the most of your walls.

**3. Opt for Light, Neutral Colors**

Color plays a crucial role in how spacious a room feels. Light colors like whites, creams, and soft pastels can make a room feel larger and airier. Opt for a neutral base and add pops of color through smaller home decor items like throw pillows, rugs, and artwork. Mirrors are also an excellent choice; they reflect light and visually expand the space, making any room feel bigger than it is.

**4. Choose Compact and Versatile Home Decor**

When decorating a small space, be selective about the room decoration items you bring in. Look for compact items that don‚Äôt overwhelm the area, such as small vases, minimalist frames, and sleek candle holders. Multi-functional pieces like storage baskets or trays can serve both as decorative accents and practical storage solutions. Compact yet versatile decor enhances your space without making it feel cluttered.

**5. Prioritize Storage-Friendly Solutions**

Small spaces often lack storage, but by choosing furniture and home decor items with built-in storage, you can keep your space tidy and organized. Think of a bed with under-bed storage, a coffee table with compartments, or wall-mounted cabinets. Baskets and bins are also great for storing smaller items and add texture to your decor. The key is to find room decoration items that help maintain a clutter-free environment.

**6. Layer Lighting for a Warm Ambiance**

In compact spaces, layering lighting can create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Use a combination of overhead lighting, wall sconces, and table lamps to add depth and dimension to the room. For a chic touch, add small decorative lights like LED string lights or battery-operated candles. These lighting elements don‚Äôt just brighten the space but also serve as stylish home decor items that enhance the room‚Äôs aesthetic.

**7. Incorporate Mirrors Strategically**

Mirrors are an effective tool for small spaces as they reflect light and give the illusion of depth. Place mirrors across from windows or behind light sources to enhance natural light and make the room feel more expansive. Decorative mirrors, whether framed or frameless, can serve as both functional and stylish [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) pieces that elevate your space.

**8. Embrace Minimalism**

Small spaces thrive on a minimalist approach. Embrace a ""less is more"" mindset by selecting only essential [room decoration items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration) and keeping clutter at bay. Choose a few statement pieces that capture your style and refrain from over-accessorizing. By keeping your space clean and uncluttered, you‚Äôll create a cozy environment that feels more spacious and inviting.

**9. Add Textures and Layers**

Creating visual interest in small spaces doesn‚Äôt have to mean adding more items. Instead, use textures and layers in your home decor items to add depth without overcrowding the room. A soft throw blanket, a woven rug, or a mix of velvet and linen pillows can give your small space a luxurious feel. Textures also add warmth, making the area feel cozy and inviting.

**10. Personalize with Small Accents**

No matter the size of your space, your home should reflect your personality. Small decorative items like framed photos, travel souvenirs, or meaningful artifacts can make the room feel unique and personalized. Incorporate these room decoration items into your design, but be mindful not to overcrowd surfaces. Small accents go a long way in transforming your space into a true home.

**Final Thoughts**

Decorating a small space may require some creative problem-solving, but with the right home decor items and strategic design choices, you can create a comfortable, stylish, and functional environment. Remember, less is often more in compact spaces. Choose pieces that serve a purpose, optimize your layout, and don‚Äôt be afraid to let your personal style shine through small yet impactful decor elements.",1,1731303945.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False
1gol88f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1gol88f/neglected_dog/,Neglected dog,"My bf and I (both 30) moved in with his brother (34m) three years ago due to financial struggles. He owns a female adult German Shepherd. We will call her Rosey. The problem is he does not take care of her. He doesn't feed her, give her water, toys or treats, doesn't play with her, bring her outside or on outings. 

He works 7am-4pm Monday thru Friday. Every other Friday he randomly takes a half day because he's ""tired."" He's actually jealous because his dad has Friday's off. Every day he comes home and goes straight upstairs to his dad's apartment for the rest of the night. The days he has off he spends the entire day either upstairs or at the bar. When he does spend time in the apartment it's  to sleep or have his ex over for a booty call. He's admitted to having a drinking and smoking problem. He's also started leaving his ex that messed herself up doing whippets at our apartment when he leaves for work in the morning. She can't drive due to seizures from the whippets so his dad drives her home.

Their dad is an HUGE enabler. If my bf mentions Rosey hasn't had anything all day he will deal with her. The landlord has mentioned several times how skinny Rosey looks and they brush it off saying he's just an asshole. His dad will do anything for his brother.

His brother doesn't do anything to contribute to our living space. He shuts his room, goes upstairs, eats meals upstairs with his dad and spends all his time away from the apartment. He does use the bathroom on a daily basis as well as throwing away trash, using the coffee maker and he doesn't take his shoes off in the house. He will walk through a dirt pile or through where I'm sweeping. His argument is the dogs don't have to wipe their feet so why should he?

His room is disgusting that's why he closes it (dirty dishes. He has a second room (actually a mud room he stupidly turned into a gaming room) which he's trashed and closed off as well. His dog used to spend her time in his room. Now all she has is a hallway with a dog cot to hang out in, no toys, her favorite thing is plushies. He banks his money and could buy her anything she could ever need but we always buy her everything. He dishes out $ for dog food intermittently when asked.

When he comes home she's very excited and howls. She also likes to rub up on you and give ""hugs."" She's the sweetest German Shepherd I've ever known. He will instantly tell her to shut the fuck up, threatening to hit her and has actually done so before.

I've been staying at home focusing on my physical and mental health as well as looking for a part time job. Eventually, I would like to start my own business. I've refused to take Rosey outside from now on because she's not trained. She will bolt out of nowhere and will disappear. She plays little games and thinks it's fun to get chased. She doesn't have a harness, just a collar. 

I do all the dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, basically all the communal cleaning because my bf works full time. I'm constantly cleaning up extra messes his brother makes. The mess that makes me the most angry is when I go to use the toilet (I have bladder control issues) and I have to clean up someone else's mess. I've pissed myself on multiple occasions because of this and bf knows all about it because he leaves messes behind too.

My dog is an adult male Border Collie who is the sweetest boy and very well trained. Unfortunately, all Rosey was taught for training is to sit and give her paw. I've asked his brother NOT to bring my dog outside under any circumstance and to focus on his dog. He refuses to listen to us and takes him out every chance saying my dog bullies his way through the door which is a lie. My dog has a weird habit of lollygagging and I basically have to force him to go outside. If brothers bf takes them outside he doesn't make sure they go to the bathroom and they end up having accidents. Who cleans up the accidents? US. I've been refusing to clean Rosey's accidents because instead of calling, texting or going upstairs to let his brother know his dog had an accident he will clean up the mess. I've told my bf over and over again he's enabling his brother's bad behavior but he's saying his brother won't change. I've refused to deal with her at all anymore but my bf told me he's going to feed and take her out so she doesn't starve, get dehydrated or have accidents.

My dog is my ESA (emotional support animal) so I can't have him going back on his training because his brother is irresponsible. Both my bf and his brother let the dogs go outside by themselves. They both have forgot about them resulting in our dog hurting his ankle following Rosey and getting soaked in a downpour.

Bfs tried talking with his mom (parents are divorced) but his parents treat his brother like a golden child for no reason. She just agrees that they all treat my boyfriend and I like shit and that's it. His dad's turning it around on me like I'm the asshole saying I'm not doing ""team work"" when my bf and I have only asked for help since we've moved in and they don't contribute.

His brother knows he's doing wrong. He thinks slipping my bf $40 or $50 every blue moon makes up for everything. He has zero communication. He doesn't even say a word to me and then asks everyone else why I don't like him and we hear his dad whine about it all the time. I have zero reason to like him. In fact, I actually hate him at this point, which is a hard thing for me to do as someone who's naturally a kind hearted person.

This whole situation is tearing our relationship apart. We fight daily about his family. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for flat out refusing to deal with Rosey and if I should just bail on my relationship, this whole living situation and call animal control on his brother.",2,1731303938.0,DogAdvice,2,1.0,False

1gol4lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1gol4lr/i_need_advice_on_managing_night_shift_schedule/,I need advice on managing night shift schedule with a growing family. ,"I‚Äôm making this post with the hopes of sitting down with my wife and both of us reading the advice that may be shared. I‚Äôll try and be short and to the point where I can be. 

Background: I‚Äôve been a night shift nurse for 8.5 years ( 3x 12) usually 3 days in a row. My wife works part time also in the medical field but isn‚Äôt a nurse and works in a office. I would do Sun-Tuesday and she does Wednesday-Friday. We now have a 2 YO beautiful daughter. This allowed us to not do any daycare this way however this only left us with a full day off together Saturday. Recently she flipped her schedule Mon-Wed and sometimes pick up a Thursday or Friday. We thought that would give us more time together thurs fri and Saturday. 

Issue: Over the last year it has been extremely hard for me to flip back to a normal dayshift even on the said Saturdays that we had off and even worse now that she is off Thursday-Saturday. I find myself staying up all day with my daughter Wednesday after my 12 hour shift Tuesday night (mother in law watches her Monday and Tuesday) and the second my wife gets home I want to pass out immediately. This messes up my sleep schedule for the rest of the week. The biggest issue is I‚Äôll fall asleep by 8-9pm that Wednesday night but i wake up at 1 or 2 AM no matter what like clock work! Same thing goes Thursday night or Friday night. I always wake up super early. I can sleep like 3-4 hours and still wake up at 2-3am wide awake or if I fall asleep during the day I can sleep through anything. 

My wife is starting to build up resentment because she feels like she‚Äôs raising our daughter by herself and we don‚Äôt get anytime together because of me sleeping during the day. I totally can see how she feels this way but I don‚Äôt think she understands how challenging this is for me. (Mind you I stopped drinking coffee a year ago, cardiac reasons) so I have no pick me ups to try and stay up later. Its not without me trying. I think falling asleep by 9pm it reasonable but I just can‚Äôt stay asleep but I can stay asleep all day long if I fall asleep say at 9 or 10AM. If I were to fall asleep at 9AM I usually wake up by 3pm or later if we have no plans but then a lot of the day is gone.

I also am the breadwinner because she went part time since the baby was born and get paid a substantial amount to stay on night shift where it does make a difference.

I read the older posts from other redditors but found I'm already doing everything that was mentioned, so thought I'd ask again. I hope that's okay. I'm just SO tired.*

8 months into life with my new stoma and I'm still battling dehydration regularly. I've been to A&E several times for IV fluids because I became so ridiculously dry. I'm battling severe fatigue at the moment and I know it means I'm bone dry again. I really do not want to make another trip to the hospital, so I'm trying to manage better on my own.

Please give me your tips and tricks for staying on top of electrolytes. Here's what I'm currently doing:

\- Drinking 2L of water a day + 1 cup of tea or coffee.

\- Drinking 1-2 cup(s) of juice a day (watermelon or cranberry juice, with coconut water added for more electrolytes)

**Is all of this just too much fluid in general?**

\- Using Lo-Salt on meals to get more potassium in. **Should I mix it with regular salt to get more sodium, too?**

\- Drinking 1 ORS packet every 10 days or so, when I feel really dry. **Should I have them more often? How often do you have them?**

\- Separating solids from liquids- not drinking with meals, and keeping 30 minutes between the two.

\- Eating 2 Marshmallows before bedtime and before showers/base changes to slow down output.

\- Eating bread, instant oats and yogurt daily to thicken output. Cannot have bananas- even 2 bites blocks me up.

My food transit time is usually 30 minutes, or 45 minutes on a good day. I dump a lot, day and night! I have a very short small intestine and my stoma is very close to my stomach, so I get a lot of undigested output, no matter how well I chew. I take a chewable multivitamin to help with nutritients and a Vit D daily oral spray, but I tend to run low on everything no matter what I do.

Please tell me where you think I'm going wrong or what else I can do to keep my electrolytes in check. I am considering having ORS daily but worry about hyperkalemia.

Tldr: I have to sign on cheap copy paper with my Pilot Falcon - tried Noodler's Xfeather but was feathering like crazy, needed recs for non-feathering permanent blue-black ink. 

  
I took the most common recommendations for blue/blue-black permanent inks and snagged samples of: 

1) Platinum blue-black 

2) Sailor Souboku (deep blue) 

3) Sailor Seiboku (blue-black)

4) Roher & Klingner Salix 

5) DeAtramentis Document Dark blue 

I couldn't find sample sizes of the Monteverde or Pelikan and, even though quite reasonably priced, I couldn't bring myself to buy an entire bottle of something I might never use. I snagged a piece of the paper used for these reports and tested out the inks with my glass dip pen first (with Xfeather for contrast). Apologies for the coffee spot...it was a long week. Also, apologies for not gathering exact details on the paper origin but can confidently say it's 20lb recycled generic stuff. My glass dip pen is wet, more so than the Falcon, but I figured that was a decent test for feathering!

[yes my handwriting is terrible, and the lighting is terrible...I tried multiple lighting sources\/angles, etc., but my phone just couldn't handle the contrast well.](https://preview.redd.it/mj2ihviih70e1.jpg?width=2736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61ad8b21a72f6edfc9fecce4fcfb003cb045a303)

I think all of them performed nearly equally well regarding feathering, or lack thereof I should say. 

DeAtramentis was thick and syrupy in a way that made me concerned for its performance in the pen. Could be the sample - maybe it had been sitting and dried out a bit, maybe from the bottom of a bottle, who knows. Either way, it was quickly eliminated. 

I preferred the inks where the blue actually showed decently. Souboku, Salix, and the DeAtramentis were so dark they might as well have been black even in natural light by eye (I realize the photo shows them all quite dark). So that narrowed it down to Seiboku and Platinum. Seiboku had absolutely ZERO feathering, but  it was very slightly drier with the dip pen. Platinum had a very small amount of feathering, though was very wet on the dip pen. What made my mind up was knowing the wetness with the dip pen would likely translate to solid flow in the Falcon which has an inherently drier feed (not dry by any means, just drier than the dip pen)....but I'm also such a sucker for shading and the Platinum blue-black had delightful shading!! So the Platinum went into the freshly-cleaned Falcon for some testing as seen at the bottom. I was worried there might be residual water so I wrote a bit extra to be sure, but the conclusion is it writes superbly on this craptastic paper and I'm SUPER happy!! Thanks to all in the community who commented and in general for all the awesome info that gets shared on the daily!!

While trends come and go, classic furniture pieces maintain their allure, giving any space a cohesive, enduring aesthetic. In this guide, we‚Äôll explore essential home furniture that adds sophistication, comfort, and functionality to your space, ensuring it feels like home for years to come. Whether you‚Äôre exploring options at furniture stores or updating your current setup, these pieces are foundational investments worth considering.

**1. The Classic Sofa**

A quality sofa is the anchor of any living room, often setting the tone for the rest of your decor. Look for sofas with clean lines, sturdy frames, and versatile colors. Neutral shades such as grey, beige, or navy work seamlessly with various decor styles and can be updated with new cushions and throws as trends shift. Many furnitures stores offer sofas with replaceable slipcovers, making them even more adaptable.

**2. Versatile Coffee Table**

A coffee table does more than hold your morning coffee‚Äîit becomes a focal point in your living space, often used for everything from entertaining guests to displaying decorative pieces. Opt for timeless materials like wood, glass, or marble, as these are both stylish and durable. Consider a table with hidden storage to keep your living room clutter-free. Furniture stores now offer coffee tables with innovative designs, allowing you to add a touch of character to the room without sacrificing timeless appeal.

**3. Dining Table for All Occasions**

Every home deserves a dining table that can accommodate everyday meals as well as special occasions. Look for sturdy, well-crafted pieces made from solid wood or glass that can endure daily use. Round tables offer an intimate setting, while rectangular ones are ideal for larger gatherings. Many home [furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) collections now include extendable tables that offer flexibility, making them perfect for those who entertain frequently.

**4. Statement Armchair**

A stylish armchair adds character to any room, whether placed in the living room, bedroom, or home office. Look for a comfortable, well-designed chair with timeless upholstery, such as leather or linen, and classic shapes that can complement any setting. The right armchair becomes more than just a seat‚Äîit‚Äôs a piece of furniture that adds warmth and elegance.

**5. Multi-functional Console Table**

A console table can be both decorative and functional. Place it in your entryway for keys, mail, or small decor items, or use it behind a sofa as extra storage space. Console tables with classic wood finishes or glass tops are versatile enough to fit a range of home styles. Many furniture stores offer customizable console tables, so you can find the perfect fit for your space.

**6. Storage Bench**

Adding a storage bench to your entryway, bedroom, or even living room can elevate both style and organization. These benches provide seating and storage, helping you keep items like shoes, blankets, and toys neatly tucked away. Choose a classic, durable material like leather or fabric in a neutral color to ensure it integrates seamlessly with your decor.

**7. Timeless Bed Frame**

Investing in a quality bed frame can transform your bedroom into a peaceful retreat. Look for frames with minimalist designs, such as sleigh or platform beds, crafted from solid wood or upholstered in fabric. A timeless bed frame will stand the test of time and adapt as you change your bedroom decor over the years. [Home furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) options often include bed frames with headboards and footboards that add a touch of sophistication.

**8. Shelving Units**

Shelving units are a practical addition to any home, offering space to display books, plants, and decor. Go for solid wood or metal shelving units with a clean design that fits any style. These pieces work well in living rooms, bedrooms, or offices and are a great way to showcase personal items that tell your story.

**9. Nightstands**

A sturdy nightstand is essential for every bedroom, providing a place for your nighttime essentials. Choose a classic design with drawers or open shelving to keep items within easy reach. Many furnitures stores offer nightstands in sets, allowing you to create a coordinated look in your bedroom.

**10. Timeless Dining Chairs**

Invest in high-quality dining chairs that blend style and comfort. Look for chairs with classic shapes, such as Windsor or Parsons chairs, that work with various table styles. Choose materials like wood, metal, or upholstered seats to ensure they last over time. When visiting [furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), test the chairs for comfort and durability‚Äîafter all, dining chairs are pieces you‚Äôll use frequently.

**Creating a Timeless Home**

But if you‚Äôre juggling credit card debt or struggling with loans, it might be time to take a closer look at your spending habits. Here are some common money drains and a few tips from financial experts to help you start saving.

# 1. Cutting Out Unnecessary Purchases

Buying things we don‚Äôt really need might seem harmless, but it adds up fast. Beyond the clutter, it also eats into your hard-earned cash. Even Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, kept a $20 flip phone until 2020. If he can resist the urge to splurge, so can we.

# 2. Skipping the Daily Coffee Run

We all love our morning coffee, but financial expert Suze Orman says your daily coffee habit could cost you a small fortune over time. She claims that investing just $100 a month in a Roth IRA over 40 years could amount to $1 million. So, skip the coffee shop, make your own at home, and put those savings into a retirement account.

# 3 Reducing Restaurant Meals

Dining out can be a major money drain if you‚Äôre doing it regularly. Instead of making it a habit, limit yourself to one meal out per week. Not only will you save, but you might also enjoy cooking more than you think‚Äîthere are tons of easy recipes online that can help you recreate your favorite dishes at home.

# 4. Avoiding New Car Purchases

It‚Äôs an old rule of thumb for a reason‚Äîa new car loses a big chunk of its value as soon as you drive it off the lot. In fact, Kelley Blue Book notes that most cars lose 20% of their value in the first year and about 60% over five years. Going for a used car could save you thousands.

# 5. Ditching Bottled Water

Buying bottled water isn‚Äôt just bad for the environment; it‚Äôs a needless expense. Tap water is nearly free, and reusable bottles are affordable. Just get a good-quality water bottle and keep it filled up to save money and reduce waste.

# 6. Considering a Side Hustle

If you have spare time, why not earn a bit more? Warren Buffett had side hustles early on, from delivering newspapers to reselling golf balls. It doesn‚Äôt have to be complex‚Äîa side job like freelancing or even selling things online could make a nice addition to your monthly income.

# 7. Rethinking Lottery Tickets

Orman calls the lottery a ‚Äútax on the poor‚Äù because the odds of winning are so low. Instead of gambling on a big win, think about putting that money toward debt or savings. You‚Äôre more likely to see your finances improve by saving that money rather than spending it on lottery tickets.

# 8. Living Within Your Means

Trying to ‚Äúkeep up with the Joneses‚Äù often leads to spending more than you can afford, creating debt and higher interest payments. It might feel tough not to have the latest car or a fancier home, but financial peace of mind is worth way more in the long run.

# 9. Using Coupons

Even billionaires love a good deal. Warren Buffett famously used McDonald‚Äôs coupons on a trip to Hong Kong. There‚Äôs no shame in saving a few dollars here and there‚Äîcouponing can help reduce your grocery bill significantly.

# 10. Canceling Unused Subscriptions

Do you have a streaming service you barely use? Or a gym membership you forgot about? These unused subscriptions can drain your bank account, especially since many auto-renew without notice. Take a few minutes to review your subscriptions and cancel any you‚Äôre not using.

# 11. Avoiding ATM Fees

ATM fees might seem minor, but they add up over time. Orman suggests choosing a bank with a large ATM network or planning your cash withdrawals in advance. It‚Äôs a small step, but cutting out these fees can save you money with zero effort.

# 12. Investing in Yourself

Yes, it‚Äôs crucial to save for retirement, but investing in yourself is just as important. Buffett encourages lifelong learning, suggesting that successful people ‚Äúgo to bed a little smarter each day.‚Äù Reading, taking a course, or even investing in health and wellness can pay off immensely.

# 13. Choosing Quality Over Quantity

Sometimes, it‚Äôs better to spend a little extra for something that will last, rather than buying a cheap version that won‚Äôt hold up. Buffett‚Äôs investment philosophy holds true here: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.‚Äù Whether it‚Äôs clothes, tools, or groceries, go for quality, and you‚Äôll likely save in the long run.

Midnight smoke signals,¬†and pages smeared with last nights regrets.

But I‚Äôve only found parking lots and half lit rooms,

Papers half written and left there to rot,

Plans like brittle leaves on autumns edge.



Each step closer feels like one more wound,¬†

the ink digs deep, the hours drag slow,

I bleed out dreams and call it growth.

Still, I know this pain has something to give,

Something with teeth, something that stays.



They‚Äôll tell you its the climb that counts, but no one talks about the fall of it,

How the weight of wanting cuts your bones while you cling to the idea of ‚Äúone day.‚Äù



But maybe that‚Äôs the art of it,

To hurt until your hands hold scars,

And call them maps, a guide homeward to something truer, 

blood stained and raw,

The kind of love and labor worth the wreckage.



So here‚Äôs to the crawl, to the bruises earned,

I didn't see my usual doctor with my initial diabetes visit, and ended up with a young doc who quickly prescribed me metformin and something for cholesterol, even though my total cholesterol was quite low at 115.  I was also offered ozympic or jardiance. There was no conversation about me trying to do this naturally, even though I mentioned it. The doctor was just following the protocol. I walked out of my appointment feeling frustrated yet more motivated than ever to get this under control myself. I picked up the prescriptions but have not taken them. That was about a month ago.

For the past 10 years I've been eating mostly a vegetarian diet so I decided to go whole food plant-based to heal myself, and positive changes are happening quickly. However, this morning I woke up feeling extra hungry, and my blood sugar was lower than it had been in a long time. I was previously ranging in the 200s in the morning after fasting, and today it was 160. I got out of bed and felt super shaky. I ate a little breakfast and even felt worse. Could it be coffee? An hour or two later I was at 133. Is it normal to feel this way as your blood sugar is decreasing? I expected to feel well, not worse.

I had some mild success but ended up burning out a bit. I realized I wasn't sure what I wanted from a first date, maybe I was setting my expectations too high. I even started to ask my really terrible dates out for second dates in the hopes that maybe something would click (spoiler alert: if the first date sucks the second one won't be better). Anyway, I ended up taking a break due to the burn out.

I still had the apps installed and notifications on so I would see whenever someone likes my profile, most of the time I wasn't interested but one girl made a funny comment on a prompt of mine from hinge. I decided what the hell, I'll take her out for coffee. Well that ended up being the best date I had all year, we just really clicked, the conversation was effortless. I asked her out for a second date and it went amazing as well. She enthusiastically agreed to a third and I was stoked.

Unfortunately, the day before the third date she texted me saying she is too overwhelmed with life right now and doesn't think she is ready to put effort into dating due to where she is in life right now. It sucks, I was bummed, but thats life I guess. Right place, wrong time. I'm still super happy I met her and she is an amazing human being. Maybe it's for the best though as she's only here for about another month and she lives across the country (US) from me.

Well, now she kind of has reinvigorated me into getting back into it. I'm just not sure if she set the bar too high and I'm going to be disappointed. Thanks for listening to my ted talk, I just really wanted to write this all down somewhere.",1,1731302321.0,self,1,0.67,False

1gokovg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1gokovg/online5easynchronous_playbypostpbp_into_the/,[Online][5e][asynchronous play-by-post/pbp] Into the Sunken Castle,"Hello, I'm looking for 3-4 players to test a oneshot I made without the time constraints of a oneshot.

I'm in my early 20s (college), and I enjoy science fantasy (or fantasy that, when you delve deeper, has elements of science fiction. Dragon Riders of PERN and Super Paper Mario are pretty cool) and worldbuilding.

Call to Action:

Supernatural creatures in the marsh have been behaving strangely around a certain location, as though they are a combination of afraid, enraged, and protective about *something*. This activity combined with historical records revealed the location of a castle that sank five centuries ago...around the same time as the flood that created the marsh. The authorities (and some opportunistic organizations) put out a call for adventurers to investigate the castle. You just arrived to the site.

Potential Motivations for going to the castle.

* Loot the castle
* Investigate cause of incident, either for personal reasons or on the behalf of an organization.
* Nosy af and want to learn about the castle

Things to keep in mind during character creation:

* Level 10, point-buy, 5e (not 2024e, though I'll keep that Eldritch Blast can target objects)
   * Current stance is no homebrew or UA, though you can bring specific pieces of homebrew or UA to me for approval. If I do approve a piece of homebrew, I'll share that it's an option with the rest of the group so we're all on the same page.
* Death is strange in the marsh.
   * There will be undead.
* Castle records indicate that the castle consists of a main hallway spiralling downward with rooms shooting off to the sides; the main hallway of the castle was built for huge humanoid creatures and the rooms were  built for medium-to-large creatures.
   * There will be a huge creature.
* Majority of the castle is underground/water.
   * There will be damaged portions of the castle.

Setting:

Homebrew mid-to-high magic setting, though you don't need extensive information about the setting unless you want to create an extensive backstory. What you need to know is that this is set in the central marshland, Evon Marsh, which was created during a supernatural flood five centuries ago.

Now that you've read the call to action, here are the parameters!

Playstyle:

The story and map will be straightforward with opportunities for combat and puzzles; there will be no opportunities for roleplay with established NPCs, though there will be a few sentient monsters that can talk and opportunities to learn lore that will be helpful later. You can expect elements of suspense and light horror; if you think it could use more/less grit after a couple days of play-by-post, feel free to let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.

Experience:

I have no experience as a DM. What I do have is around two years of experience as a player, a fondness for creative writing, and physical access to the core books + Xanathar's. I mostly play with people I know, but I'm playing a play-by-post campaign with people from a coffee/tea company server, so there's that.

My expectations:

We will use asynchronous play-by-post; I will expect at least five posts per week, preferably at least one per day if that's possible with your schedules. I will also expect that you'll abide by the rulebook and ask questions if you're not sure as far as mechanics are concerned, as that will make DMing easier.

If you're new to DnD, welcome! Let me know if you want help with character creation.

No PvP, but you are allowed to employ pvp-like actions that are intended to help a fellow player break out of a charmed condition or similar situations. No racism/sexism/homophobia/etc. No NSFW content. Be nice to myself and your fellow players. No eyeball gore.

Medium:

Discord for roleplay + Avrae dice bot for dice + DnDBeyond (or another means for me to access your character sheet, I don't have digital copies of the books). Mostly theatre of the mind, though I'll break out MS Paint when there's a combat scene.

To apply, please DM me on reddit (if you're unfamiliar with this, here's how on desktop: click on my username at the top of the post, then click on chat) with answers to the following questions:

1. Experience with DnD 5e
2. What you expect from the game
3. What you want to see from the game
4. Anticipated frequency in posting
5. Character ideas
6. Your yes's and no's

1) Have an extra thumb on each hand, opposite your existing thumb.  In this scenario your pinky finger becomes a copy of your index finger, and your ring finger identical to your middle finger.  Basically, take your current thumb and first two fingers and mirror them on the other side of your palm in place of your ring and pinky fingers.  With this modification, many tasks that currently take both hands can be done easily with one and its relatively easily concealed from casual observers if you care to, but you have to buy custom gloves.

2) Have a prehensile tail that's a long as you are tall.  It's the width of your wrist where it emerges just above your butt crack, and the width of your thumb at the tip.  It is strong and dexterous enough to, say, stick through the handle and wrap around a full coffee mug to pick it up without spilling, or to open many but probably not all door knobs.  It greatly enhances balance, but you couldn't hang from it except maybe in a dire emergency and with serious risk of injury.

In summary, I am front desk/NA staff for a small pet-friendly hotel. Our pet fee is a single $75 charge for up to two pets, excluding only service animals. Last night, a guest checked in with an unleashed french bulldog who was wandering all over the place and misbehaving. I told guest about the pet fee, and he was adamant that because his dog was an emotional support animal that he did not have to pay the fee. I told him that was not the same as a service animal, and he said he would be speaking with management in the a.m.

Fast forward to this morning, our manager-in-training came in to relieve me from the shift and I was going over switch shift notes when Mr. MyPetShouldNotCostMeMoney just so happened to be coming down. He had his dog in the lobby again, still unleashed and wandering around among several guests. Both manager and I immediately said that a leash was needed for the dog, and that is how the chaos began.

*Manager: Sir, your dog is not allowed to be wandering around like that without a leash. You will need to grab him.*

*Guest: He is emotional support, it's fine.*

*OP: Regardless of what he is, he is trying to get into the snack basket at our coffee table. Either he can wear a leash, or he needs to go back to the room.*

The guest immediately clocked me and realized that the guy standing with me was management staff. He got all excited and walked over to us,

*Guest: \**Pointing at me*\* She was very rude last night, tried charging my dog a fee. I want to make a complaint.*

*Manager: I am sorry to hear that, what is your complaint?*

*Guest: I just told you my dog is for support. I've never been charged a fee before, but she would not accept this. I told her I had papers, and she just kept saying it was policy. Very rude girl.""*

At this point, the guest had plopped those papers down on the desk, which were emotional support animal certifications. This was actually perfect for me, unbeknownst to him.

*Guest: See? That's support animal discrimination.*

*Manager: \**Thinking the same thing as me*\* Sir... these are papers for an emotional support animal. Unfortunately, they do not qualify as service animals and are charged the same as a regular animal.*

*Guest: This is the problem! He is a service animal!*

*OP: Sir, what service tasks has your animal been trained to perform?*

*Guest: I do not have to answer that!!*

*Manager: I am sorry for the inconvenience, however as my auditor said last night; the fee will have to stand.*

The guest was beyond irate at this point, yelling that he would not pay for that and that we were being discriminant. I guess I was smiling behind my manager or something, because I found this adult tantrum to be hilarious, but the guest got even more pissed and started yelling, ""*You bitch!*"" several times. We have several large bottles of hand sanitizer, and he took the opportunity to throw one at me in his anger. It didn't hit me, and I was fine, but manager said that the guest now just needed to leave and started to call the police. I feel bad for this guy's dog honestly, it was hiding under the coffee table as all of this happened.

The police came, and the guest finally left. The poor manager looked so frazzled, he's a sweet guy and new to the craziness of front desk life so this was a shitty way to start his shift. I made sure to grab myself a nice snack on the way home after all of that. In the past, I have had several service animals stay with us and their owners have always answered the two questions as well as behaving with no problem. People like this guy make it harder for them to be accepted or taken seriously, which is such a shame. I have such immense respect for service animals and what they do.

Anyways, I figured anyone who was curious about the aftermath would like to know how it ended. Cheers all, thanks for all the kind words in the original post. :)",112,1731301051.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,12,1.0,False

After my ADHD diagnosis, I embraced caffeine and I love how it makes me feel calmer and like I can finally function at school or get work done, however I tend to over do it because the feeling of competency soon fades.

1gok9fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1gok9fm/feeling_confused_and_used_after_a_close_friendship/,Feeling Confused and Used After a Close Friendship,"I really appreciate any insight you may have.

Earlier this year, I went through a tough romantic breakup, and shortly after, a female co-worker started chatting with me and asked me to go on a walk after work, which ended up being us talking late into the night. I genuinely thought we both enjoyed each other‚Äôs company and maybe I started then to develop some feelings in the back of my mind. I‚Äôd go places with her that I didn‚Äôt care much for to make her happy and be supportive. I think she also did the same for me. She even wanted to cook for me, and I made her coffee one night, which she loved. We shared jokes, exchanged small gifts, and had heartfelt conversations. For a while, it felt like we both needed each other‚Äôs friendship. She even started to take interest in my hobbies and the things I really liked.

After a few months, she told me being social with me was exhausting, mentioning her struggles with ADHD and her limited social battery. I respected this and let things slow down. But every time we were together, it still felt like there was a deep connection. We‚Äôd even hold each other when we walked, and every time we did so, she would have this infections smile and say how much taller I was than her and that she never realized it. I smiled back, in that moment it was like we were in love or something, and I enjoyed it.

One week, I barely heard from her, and I decided to give her some space incase that was what she needed. When I noticed she didn't seem like herself during a work meeting, I reached out and asked if she was ok, to which she told me she hasn't been and has been struggling due to a family situation. Previously she had helped me get over something emotional in my life by just being a friend, so naturally I wanted to do the same. I was sick at the time and had a limited voice, but I talked with her over dinner (because she stopped eating, something she does often when upset and a lot during our friendship). I offered her great advice on how to navigate the situation. She messaged me after she put the advice to use and thanked me for the push. I felt so happy for her.

Two weeks ago, we had dinner and told each other how much our friendship meant to each other because we both did not have any other good friends like us. We teared up. She later held my hand that night for the first time for a little bit in the car before leaving. This was when it started to click in my mind that maybe I really like this person more than I realized, and maybe she felt the same.¬†

Recently, she started talking with a ten years younger than her co-worker at another job who‚Äôs not really her type‚Äîdrinks, smokes, smokes weed, ‚Äúlost in life‚Äù she told me, and that he asked her out to which she declined due to these reasons. But then continued to talk with him and did so one night until 1:30 AM, later than she has ever hung out with me. I was still supportive and telling her to set boundaries so she wouldn‚Äôt lead him on by mistake, which she said she set them and wouldn‚Äôt lead him on and he was just nice to talk with. Very recently, she told they had a real date, and I felt so crushed by hearing this, my heart sank. I was still supportive and told her I was happy for her because she is finally dating (something she also struggled with). She explained to me they had similar personalities, both have ADHD, that they can have fun but not sexual fun (she wants to wait until marriage), and she can be her ‚Äúautistic self‚Äù around him. I asked her if she thinks he would accept the boundaries she set especially for sex as he‚Äôs at a young age, but she got defensive and said I was acting like her dad by lecturing her, to which I told her I was sorry and just was being a supportive friend. After that, she began withdrawing from me.

In the days that followed, my anxiety spiked. I wondered if I‚Äôd missed signs she liked me, that maybe I‚Äôd focused too much on being a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù when I felt more. I decided to call her and ask. I brought up our long talks, hand-holding and holding each other, intimate conversations, gift giving, but she told me it was all just friendship and regretted the hand-holding. She also listed reasons we couldn‚Äôt work as a couple: she doesn‚Äôt believe in male friendships while dating (where as I can have female friends while dating), we have different family values and financial views, she wants to wait for intimacy until marriage (she‚Äôs religious), and what hurt the most was when she listed things I've said to her in the past and picked them apart to me like I was criticizing her or being rude to her. I explained that was never my intention and I was only being a good friend trying to uplift her at times to boost her self-confidence and that she enjoyed when we joked around, to which she said yes we were joking. I said I didn‚Äôt know those things bothered her because she never told me. She never said anything to me about this until now.

I felt overwhelmed, and in trying to explain myself, I got flustered and mixed up some words which didn‚Äôt help at all. I did tell her that the right person can make you want to adjust and how I truly don‚Äôt mind waiting for intimacy, but she dismissed it, saying I shouldn‚Äôt change for her. She called this a ‚Äúlearning lesson (pause) for both of us‚Äù and ended by saying we‚Äôd stay professional but wouldn‚Äôt talk or hang out as before, and that she isn‚Äôt mad at me. She further stated that the perfect girl is out there for me and I need to find her. I told her I respected her decision and meant it when I said I was happy for her in her new ‚Äúgo with the flow, not a big deal‚Äù she told me, just starting relationship with this guy ten years younger than her.

This has been incredibly hard for me, as she‚Äôs the first close friend I‚Äôve had who I connected with on so many levels. I appreciated her quirks, the way she dressed and style, her advice at work, her hobbies. I feel like I may have been just a placeholder or even a way for her to fill time until something else came along. Perhaps she said those things to make it easier for her to push me away? I still care deeply about her and wonder if there‚Äôs a chance she felt something more but just didn‚Äôt want to admit it. Questions I won't have answered yet, I‚Äôm trying to come to terms with letting go and be at peace. The other day we passed each other at work and locked eyes, and she waved to me. I know she still cares about me.",2,1731300523.0,lostafriend,1,1.0,False

I have been doing some research, and have reduced my options down to a t14s and a t16. I am from the US of A.

|Model|Price|Processor|RAM|Storage|Weight|Screen Size|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|T16|\~1000$|Ryzen 5 7540U|16GB|2TB|1.71kg|16 inch|

  
I used the lenovo website to compare. Picking Ubuntu as the installed OS helped me to get the price down. I am going to replace it with Arch anyways (I use Arch btw).

2 Inches of extra screen and 1 TB of extra storage sounds very very nice. But is it worth the 500g increase in wt? Is the weight even noticeable? My current laptop is 2.4 Kg and the charger is fat brick. I hate it.

Looking for feedback / opinions. Incase someone already owns one of these and has something to share, I'd be thankful. This is a lot of money for me and I hope to make this laptop last for several years.

Here are my requirements, in case you have other suggestions.

1. **Light, Good battery, \~1000$, and quiet fans.** My current laptop is 2.4 Kg, my back hurts when I walk to my uni. And it lasts an hour w/o being plugged in. I want to code in coffee shops and in my dog park. Also it gets loud so I need to power my old thermostat to drown the noise.
2. **Good CPU:** I do a lot of programming. Mostly recreational, but a lot. Also I usually have 40+ tabs open and I like listening to music.
3. **16gb ram + 1TB SSD** : More is better. But this is good. Can't go below.
4. **14 inch+, beautiful screen:** I try to fit 3 panels of code in my screen. I wish I could fit more. But I imagine that would increase weight a lot.
5. **Decent enough GPU**: Integrated is fine. I don't play games. Occasionally Minecraft. I do gfx programming, but all hardware from the last decade supports vulkan 1.3 so I am not too picky. I don't use their ray tracing api either. A cheap gpu like 1660 would be nice (I play civ 6 with a friend group sometimes but I don't think it would run on integrated) but if it affects battery or weight, then I don't want it.

Feel free to reply. Thanks.

Is there anywhere else nearby where I could do something similar? The only criteria I have are:

* Bottomless coffee
* Decaf available (having several caffeinated cups would kill me)
* Walking distance from King West
* Ideally not too busy so I don't feel bad preventing someone else from sitting

Of course, I could go to any of the coffee shops in the area, but I always feel like I should leave once I'm done my drink and getting more than one would be too expensive. I prefer unpretentious places anyway.

Any recommendations?",1,1731299893.0,askTO,10,0.54,False
1gok2un,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1gok2un/im_very_anxious_about_an_incident_at_work/,I'm very anxious about an incident at work..,"So, I (31F) have been a server for around 3 years. My current restaurant is my second restaurant. When I was a server at my first restaurant, I had learned from some of the experienced servers that paying for guests things out of our own pocket was a thing.

So, at both restaurants, there have been times where I feel bad about something that happened and I've paid for their dessert or their coffee or whatever out of my own pocket.

My restaurant is very adamant that we get a manager involved any time there is even an inkling of a guest being upset. So I go to them every time.

Today, I had a table where the system seemed not to retain the order I put in. I didn't realize it didn't save until around when their food should've been ready. I re-entered it and put it on the fly. I went on my lunch (was a double today) a few minutes later after checking on them and getting them another round of drinks.

They didn't seem upset whatsoever.

I had another table today where a lady *was* upset, and I had a manager do a table touch there.

I feel that it's a deeper level of personal accountability. If I mess up once.. sure, get a manager involved. If I mess up again, wtf is wrong with me I need a reasonable disciplinary action to keep me on my toes. So I pay with my own money. If it's my money on the line beyond just the tip, maybe I'll do better.

Realistically, I know most of the things aren't actually my fault.. but I always feel like I'm the scum of the earth any time something doesn't go well. Like, I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight because I don't know if I'll be able to stop crying.

I'm really upset right now.

My manager said it's suspicious that I didn't go to them. I didn't realize I needed to. My table didn't seem at all upset and I bought them a dessert. The issue is that I told them they could choose a dessert and that I'd pay for it for them. They ordered 3, and so I reiterated that I'd split off one.

They said okay, but called later saying they were overcharged. They seemed to understand that I'd pay for one dessert for them, but they somehow misunderstood and thought it would be 3 for free.

Integrity is so fucking important to me. I despise lying. I'm the type who is honest even if it gets me in trouble. But even after explaining my side, she said it is suspicious. But, like.. why would they think that when I very quickly went to a manager when someone was upset at my other table?

I take accountability for my own actions. I told her I learned it from my last job from the other servers, and how I've done it here before. She said I shouldn't have told her that. Is this frowned upon? No one has ever told me it is wrong. I hate doing bad things. 

I'm the most lame person ever. Didn't try alcohol until I was 26. Not a single sip. Didn't try weed until I was 27, and it isn't something I'm into. Didn't try nicotine until I was 29. I've never stolen anything in my life. I didn't have sex until I was 22, was vegetarian for 14 years, have never cheated, and I genuinely hate lying. Even white lies. 

I feel like when people do bad things it releases some sort of negative energy and I don't want to be associated with that. I keep most people at a distance because their level of apathy isn't relatable nor comfortable for me at a deep level.

I truly didn't think I needed to bother them if my table wasn't upset. It isn't a their problem thing. It's a my problem thing. That was my mindset. I've thought about it before when paying for things knowing I can't afford it. And ""good karma"" popped in my head. I'm the type who does the right thing even when nobody will ever know or care.

At first when she pulled me into the office to ask about it, I thought thing were fine and she just wanted to know what was up. But as we spoke I became more and more aware that it might genuinely be an issue.

I'm such a hard worker, and they know that. I'm one of the only approved closers. Not everyone is trusted with that.

For them to think that it's suspicious even after hearing my mindset and seeing how open I am about talking about what happened because I didn't think there was anything wrong.. it feels like it could be projection.

I'd never do it with any bad intention. If I felt a manager was needed I would've gotten a manager. I always do.

I'm really anxious, and I feel like I'm stuck in a mental loop of trying to reassure myself and calm myself because I know I didn't do anything with any sort of malicious or deceptive intent.. and knowing that my manager said it's suspicious and just because I know the truth doesn't mean they'll believe me.

But I don't see why they wouldn't. I've proven myself over and over again, and I've been in situations before where some people couldn't believe the good things I've done because they'd literally never consider doing anything like that. To me, this isn't even a big thing. I feel bad in the moment and want to make it right. If they aren't upset I pay for something small for them. It feels like the right thing to do.

To you more experienced servers.. is it not normal to do that? I've seen multiple servers do it at my last restaurant. And I think 1 or 2 at my current restaurant, from way more experienced servers but they no longer work with me. I'm sure my top manager will talk with me the next time I work with him. I'm expecting a write up.

It's really scary to me thinking that I'm in trouble and that I did something terrible when I never considered that possibility for a moment. I don't know if this is coming out jumbled. I'm having trouble thinking straight. I'm fighting a panic attack right now. I had no idea I wasn't supposed to be doing this.

Please tell me if what I was doing was wrong. And idk what to do if my managers don't believe me. I thought I was doing a *good* thing. Selfless (willing to hurt myself to compensate for something I wish had gone better, even if it's not my fault). But my manager thinks it's bad..

I have a lot of really stressful things happening in my life right now, so this is really affecting me and I'm having trouble calming down.

I put so much effort into everything I do, and I'm very hard on myself if I'm anything less than perfect. It's something I've worked on for many years, and I have gotten better. But it gets bad sometimes. Especially when I've been extremely stressed for months straight.

I know I overexplain and loop repetitively when I'm this anxious, so I usually just keep to myself until I work through the problem I'm facing.. but I really don't know what to do about this. I feel like I just killed someone's cat when all I did was clean out their litter box.

I'm a very logic-based individual. Someone knock the sense back into me. üò≠",0,1731299888.0,Serverlife,9,0.29,False

I (24F) am currently a grad student that just started my third year. I moved to this new city and school when I started my PhD program so making some friends and surviving grad school has been the main priority, and it‚Äôs been super tough so far. Now that I‚Äôm in my third year I finally feel like I have a little bit more a handle on things and am in a place where I can realistically see myself getting into a relationship. I‚Äôm getting a little ahead of myself here. I am someone who can get a crush at the drop of a hat and they‚Äôre generally harmless and I keep it close to the chest (for me to even tell a friend is a big deal). Crushes generally come and go for me, but I‚Äôve had a consistent crush on one of the other grad students in my program (29M) since I met him. He is a bit ahead of me, he was a third year when I was a first year. I‚Äôve enjoyed getting to know him more and more and appreciate him for the person he is. I‚Äôve never done anything about the crush for a plethora of reasons (not wanting to get rejected, not wanting to make the vibe in the department weird (my subgroup in the department is rather small so anything bad would make a big impact) etc). I feel like I‚Äôve been telling myself over the past few months to just let it go bc it‚Äôll never happen and be probably doesn‚Äôt like me (I.e. he would have probably done something by now if he did). Recently, after hearing some therapist advice, I decided it does me no good to just sit here alone with it without acting on any of it. We have hung out in group events several times. So I asked him to grab a drink/coffee last weekend just us two and we did. We went to a local place and had a nice conversation for about 2hours over drinks. This entire process was nerve wracking enough, and I thought it‚Äôd be the final nail in the coffin of whether there was something there or if I would get the definitive no I needed to actually move on. Getting drinks was never explicitly a date though. I just asked to grab drinks we never defined it. And while it gave me hope in the moment, nothing has changed since then. We haven‚Äôt made any additional plans. Is it time to just force myself to give up and try to move on? How do I navigate moving forward?

1gojsqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1gojsqr/my_experience_post_lap_myomectomy/,My Experience Post Lap Myomectomy ,"Hi all,

I wanted to share my experience around my lap myo procedure. I‚Äôm sitting here at day two post op and already feeling like a whole new person. 

Symptoms and Initial Diagnosis:
I‚Äôve had heaver and more painful periods for the last couple of years, coincidentally lining up with my getting a copper IUD. Doctors wrote off most of my symptoms (heavy bleeding and clots, bad cramps, extend fatigue during periods) as side effects of my IUD. 

I wish I would have pushed harder to get a diagnosis. 

Things were kicked into action in September when one the fibroids twisted causing bad pain. That sent me to the ER twice over that weekend where they did lots of imaging and bloodwork. In that process they discovered two fibroids, one larger than my uterus and another that was only about 2cm. 

I took all of that information to a minimally invasive gynecological oncologist surgeon due to concerns about the placenta and complexity of the larger mass. We had a good consult and agreed to a stepped surgical approach to take place in about 5 weeks.  

Waiting For Surgery:
During the 5 weeks between my diagnosis and surgery I tried to focus on getting in good shape. I wanted to feel as strong as I could going to surgery. I worked on my diet, did a lot of yoga, and a lot of meditation to let go of my anxiety around everything. I think the focus on my health is making my recovery so much better. The core strengthening in yoga made a big difference in my ability to get back moving. 

Surgery:
The day of the surgery I woke up, had some water and black coffee, and went to the hospital. I felt very cared for and understood by my surgical team. 

Coming out of anesthesia was rough. I was extremely nauseous and dizzy for the rest of the day. They gave me a patch to wear behind my ear which I think helped with the nausea some. Once I got home I basically went straight to bed. 

Post Op and Recovery:
There are a few things that have made a huge difference for me!

Most critically, once I got home from the hospital I immediately started taking 600 mg of ibuprofen and 500 mg of Tylenol every 6 hours on the dot. I ended up setting a 6 hour timer on my phone and use it to keep up, including overnight. Keeping my pain under control that was has allowed me to not feel like I have to use the narcotics they prescribed. I can‚Äôt recommend this enough. Your mileage may vary without the narcotics but I find that they make me feel nauseous and hung over. 

I ordered an abdominal binder which has helped me feel comfortable moving around. 

I‚Äôve prioritized getting up and moving at least once an hour, even if it‚Äôs just to walk across the room. I can already feel that mobility making a difference in the healing. 

I purchased two larger gel ice packs that I can hold in the waistband of my pants, which helped with the pain on the first day greatly. 

I ordered a set of pads which has been helpful for the post op bleeding and early period that started today. 

I‚Äôve also started to gently massage my abdomen to get the surgical gas moving. 

I know this a long write up, but I know how helpful I found these posts to be while I was preparing for my surgery! ",5,1731298907.0,Fibroids,2,1.0,False

Khamrah Qahwa - 9/10 - Sweet and very syrupy and the coffee note makes it feel somewhat masculine, drydown is quite nice. Have not tried Angel's Share or Khamrah OG so I can't compare them, but this is a really nice fall/winter scent, very cozy. Good longevity and projection is solid for me. 

Oud for Glory - 8/10 - Was really curious about this one because it seems to be very polarizing (I really wanted to like it bc the bottle is awesome). I definitely enjoyed this one, very earthy and elegant to me. Projects quite well at first and the dry down lasts for a long time. Something I would enjoy wearing to formal dinners, special events, etc.

Honor and Glory - 8/10 - Much more of an everyday scent than OfG and easier to pull off for younger wearers. I like sweet scents and tropical scents so this is quite nice for me. I feel that it's perfectly unisex, the spices make it just masculine enough for me (I feel like you only really get the spices up close though, in the air it's all pineapple creme brulee). I could wear this any season, but I think springtime is what it reminds me of the most.

Xclusif Oud Bleu - 7.5/10 - I had never smelled the Layton DNA before and I really enjoyed this. Can't compare it to the OG, but I would say on this one the opening was a bit harsh for me, but the dry down was really good. I feel like this suits most occasions in cool weather. Would definitely consider buying a full bottle but I will probably find something I like better.

Asad - 7/10 - I have actually smelled Sauvage Elixir before I think they are very similar. I found Asad to be nice, very spicy and masculine and also a tiny bit overhyped. Probably won't buy a full bottle just because I didn't like it enough to need 100 ml.

Al Noble Ameer - 5.5/10 - This was the free sample of the bunch and it's not bad it just does not suit my taste at all. I found it spicy, smoky, and floral so if that's your vibe, go for it. Some people have also described it as being similar to new car smell, which I kind of get. I'm going to be giving the rest of the decant to my Arabic friend who loves wearing his dad's middle eastern fragrances, hoping he'll enjoy it more than I do.

1gojpag,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gojpag,8 m/o puppy help!,"Our baby has been such a good dog from the moment we got him- he still is! but this past month he has gotten so crazy! He is so destructive! Any toy thats not plastic he destroys in minutes. If hes on the bed or couch he is eating holes in it. Chewing shoes, eating books, the coffee table, literally anything he can get his paws on!! He started ripping up his bed in his crate. Its so random because this wasn‚Äôt a big problem in the past and hes done teething! We tell him no and redirect to other toys but its not working. He has SO much energy now too- I have to give him a bully stick daily to get him calm for like 30 minutes. I know I cant keep giving him those. We are at a loss! Is it just a phase he will grow out of? Are we doing something wrong?? We try to keep anything he can chew out of reach but its impossible to keep everything out of the way.

1gojp94,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gojp94/i_accidentally_had_sex_in_my_friends_bed/,I accidentally had sex in my friend's bed,"Throwaway for obvious reasons (I'm mortified). Also changed a few of the personal details for anonymity.

  
Okay so for some background I (F29) have autism, and I have a really hard time dealing with some of the sensory aspects of sex. I wanted to experiment with what accommodations might be helpful, but I don't have a partner to do that with right now. I was thinking that a professional would be more open to helping me out with this than some stranger, so I hired a sex worker. Let's call her Kira (F30ish). 

I went to the apartment Kira told me to. We had a great time. She was very sweet, and genuinely really helpful in helping me figure out some ways to work around my sensory issues. I'll be able to take a lot of the things I learned with her into my future relationships. Hiring a sex worker isn't something I plan to do again, but I'm really glad I did it here. Anyway, she told me the friend that lets her use the apartment was coming back so we had finish up and leave. I helped clean up, thanked her, left, and thought nothing more of it.

  
Flash forward a few months later. I've connected with someone through my school program, Ava (30F) (her real name is also a very common one), and we decide to get to know each other over coffee. We have a lot in common, as it turns out, and we become really good friends.

Ava and I went out for dinner one night, and we had a lovely time. Ava said I could park at her apartment since it's close to the restaurant we were meeting at. And as I was walking through her building I realized it looked familiar. At first I didn't think anything of it. When I was younger I did food delivery so I've been in a lot of buildings in the area. But then as we were coming back from the restaurant and going through the building again, things started to click into place. The building is, in fact, one I've been to before. It's the one I met a sex worker in.

Honestly, I wasn't too concerned when I realized this. Sure, it was a weird coincidence that Ava lived in this same building, but whatever. But then I started remembering all the other weird coincidences. I remembered that when I'd asked Kira about where to meet her, she'd told me the apartment wasn't hers but was rented by a friend of hers that lets her use it for clients. And then I remembered Kira telling me ""if security stops you when you're buzzing in, say that you're here to see Ava."" And THEN I remembered (and double checked to be sure) that the apartment number I had met Kira in was the same one Ava lived in.  

I thought it would be a good idea to email Kira to let her know the situation. Now that there was a non-0 chance I could end up in a room with her and Ava at the same time, I didn't want her to think I was some sort of creep who became friends with Ava to get closer to her. I told her that if Ava ever wanted to introduce her to a friend named (my name), the answer should be no. Kira appreciated me telling her, and we had a laugh about how crazy this is. It's a very, *very* good thing I told her, because guess who Ava and I run into a couple weeks later while we're leaving Ava's apartment? Yeah. 

  
It's been a couple weeks since I learned all of this, and I'm still just in shock. I had sex on my friend's bed. Where she sleeps. With her friend. Like, *how* does this happen? There are so many apartments in this city, what were the chances that I just so happened to end up in the one my friend lets a sex worker use? It doesn't seem real. And yet here I am. And I can't stop wondering if I'm supposed to tell Ava??? Would that be weird? Like, she's the kind of person that would find this hilarious (and find how mortified I am even more hilarious), but still. ",1,1731298571.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.6,False
