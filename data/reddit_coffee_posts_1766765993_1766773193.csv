1pwayj6,https://i.redd.it/51jd14cdbl9g1.png,"Officially introducing my spider girl, Aranea Parker (no she isn't a spiderman OC, and the name Parker doesn't mean she is related to the Peter Parker. It's a reference.)","Aranea Parker is the fifth of six monster sisters. She is usually very quiet and keeps to herself, as most people who know what she is are either terrified of her, or call her gross.

While she may look human at first, her mouth can open to produce spider like fang and pinsirs. 
She also can open her six other eyes that are usually hidden.
And lastly, and most damning, she had four long, sharp, spider-like appendages that can extend from her back. They full on pierce out of her is a gross and gorey manner, this being the purpose of her common use of wearing more open shirts, so she doesn't rip her clothes.


Because of her recluse (hah get it, like a recluse spider) nature, she doesn't have as extravagant of a backstory as her sisters do. She does however seem to be the most fully ""adult"" of them all. In terms of saying she is the most functional. She had worked a job prior, and only had to leave in risk of, well, being a spider person. 
She has actually gone to online college classes.
And so she is the lost Knowledgable about human traditions. 


One night, she was in a bar, and was trying to enjoy a drink, not that alcohol was super effective in her. She could withstand many poisons, including that of alcohol, and so she wouldn't get drunk no matter how much whiskey she downs.

However, coffee, that was different. And so she paid the bartender a little extra, and knowing she was a regular, he hooked her up with a ln expresso shot.

She did end up leaving, intoxicated on caffeine, and was actually slobbering droll and her spider jaw hung loose. She pumped into a woman, knocking her in her butt. Aranea reached out an arm to help... A spider arm. She didn't even notice her spider limbs came out, but the sight of a drooling woman with spider limbs and a sharp jaw and pinches over a woman in the floor was a bad look.


However, to her surprise, the man that first intercepted this meeting was quick to notice Aranea seemed concerned and apologetic, and didn't actually want to hurt the woman. The man helped the woman to her feet, but she began to cuss and swear and slur at the spider woman, who accepted the words without much hassle.

The man took her back into the bar, and bought her another expresso shot, at her request, and himself a simple lemon drop.

He had a feeling where this was going, his massive home and laboratory was already housing multiple monster girls, and so he wasn't even halfway surprised when he carried her drunken, half asleep, half unaware body back to his home, and gave her an empty room to sleep the night away.


Come morning, she had a talk with the man who she learned was a scientist, and also met the other four girls who were living there. But to everyone's surprise, which they all assumed she would also be joining them, she declined. 

She explained she actually lived on the other side of the city, and was renting an apartment.  So she kindly thanked them all and left, heading home.

However, over time, she began to feel lonely once more, as the thought of having friends to live with would actually be pretty fun. 
A fewo that go by, however, without incident, except she was running out of money, and finding a new job was getting harder. She eventually was unable to pay her rent on time, and then a second and last month, she was told she would have to pack up. 

She thanks her landlady and leaves, with one location in mind. She knocks on the door to the massive house, and the scientist answered. She explained her situation, and while she didn't actually expect him to take her in, he kindly did so. Letting her stay, free of charge, for as long as she felt comfortable. 
Which happened to be a long time.


After a while, she went to check in the scientist, along with her new sisters, as it was his birthday, and she of all people wanted to show her gratitude for all his kindness. But they found he had passed away in his sleep. 

They buried him in his backyard beneath a tree, and made the mutual agreement to visit this laboratory every year, then wnt in to go their separate ways. 


Aranea, had managed to find a job while staying at the lab, and so she didn't have trouble paying for a new apartment. She works as a window cleaner for store and companies. It's good money. And so she spent her time either working, or at her apartment, comfortably in her own private domicile.

A raft of new laws will impact Brits in 2026, from new border controls and a £17 fee to travel to Europe to four-bin recycling rules, a junk food ad ban from January, and DWP powers to tackle benefit fraud

The dawn of the new year heralds a slew of fresh laws that Brits will need to watch out for in the coming months.

Holidaymakers should be aware of new border controls and a new £17 fee for European travel from late 2026. Households might find themselves with an additional bin due to revamped recycling regulations mandating waste separation into four distinct categories.

The government's ongoing battle against unhealthy eating habits continues, with a junk food advertising ban set to take effect and plans to prohibit children from purchasing high-caffeine drinks. A new suite of workplace rules will enhance employee rights and protections, alongside a minimum wage increase this spring.

Renters can expect significant changes with the implementation of a no-fault eviction ban and the termination of fixed contracts and bidding wars. Concurrently, the government's clampdown on benefit fraud persists with the introduction of new powers enabling automatic debt collection.

Here, we've summarised some of the major changes Brits can anticipate in the coming months and their potential impact on you, reports the Manchester Evening News.
New border controls and a £17 fee to travel to Europe

New regulations for Brits travelling to Europe were initiated in 2025, with more alterations expected next year.

The new Entry Exit System (EES) mandates non-EU citizens, including Brits, to register at the EU border by scanning their passport and providing their fingerprints and photograph. The EES is necessary when entering Schengen area countries, such as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, but it's not required for travel to Ireland and Cyprus.

This new system started its six-month phased roll-out in October, so different ports will be implementing the new rules up until April 2026. Under the system, travellers won't need to take any action before their trip and there's no cost involved.

However, a new fee for people visiting EU countries is set to be introduced towards the end of next year. The European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) is slated to be launched in the final quarter of 2026.

The fee will be 20 euros, about £17, for any adult under the age of 70. Once paid, registration will be valid for up to three years.

Unlike with the EES, the ETIAS will require travellers to apply online ahead of their trip.
New ETA scheme for visitors to the UK

There will also be new regulations for non-Brits arriving in the UK.

From February 25, visitors from 85 nationalities, including the United States, Canada, and France, who don't need a visa will not be able to legally travel to the UK without an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).

The ETA scheme has been gradually implemented over the past few years, but from February it will be fully enforced. This means that anyone wishing to visit the UK must have digital permission through either an ETA or an eVisa, which carriers will check before travel.

The government has stated that this change represents a ""significant step towards digitising the immigration system"" and ""paves the way for a contactless UK border in the future"".

Since the introduction of the ETA in October 2023, more than 13.3million visitors have successfully applied. The government has declared the ETA as now being ""a fundamental part of travel, including for visitors who take connecting flights and go through UK passport control"".

Visitors can apply for an ETA via the official UK ETA app at a cost of £16. According to the government, most people currently receive a decision automatically within minutes, but it is advised to allow three working days in case an application requires additional review.

British and Irish citizens, including those with dual citizenship, are exempt from needing an ETA.
New recycling bin rules for every household

The government is introducing new rules across England in an effort to boost recycling rates among households. It is hoped that these changes will improve bin day, making it easier to sort your rubbish and understand what can and cannot be recycled.

From March 31, new 'Simpler Recycling' regulations will require all local authorities to collect four distinct waste streams separately, meaning every household will need four separate bins. The changes won't impact everyone, as some areas may already be meeting the new requirements.

Waste collection services will be required to gather food and garden waste, paper and cardboard, all other dry recyclable materials such as glass and plastic, and non-recyclable waste destined for landfill. All these waste categories must be collected from every household, including flats.

Steve Cole, managing director of Biffa Municipal, commented: ""For too long, households have struggled with a muddled and confusing patchwork of approaches to their bin collections. Simpler Recycling will make recycling easier and more consistent by ensuring everyone can recycle the same materials, no matter where they live.""

From March 2027, waste collectors will also be required to collect plastic film packaging and plastic bags alongside plastic recycling.
Junk food adverts banned before 9pm

A prohibition on junk food advertising will take effect from January.

Since October, youngsters have been subjected to fewer advertisements for unhealthy food on television and online as part of a voluntary crackdown by advertisers, ahead of the complete ban taking effect from the new year.

The ban will stop high fat, sugar or salt (HFSS) food and drink from appearing on television between 5.30am and 9pm, and online at any time. Outdoor advertising – including billboards, buses, bus shelters, train stations, shopping centres and taxis – remains exempt from the ban.

The restrictions cover products across 13 categories deemed most significant contributors to childhood obesity, such as soft drinks, chocolates and sweets, pizzas and ice creams, as well as breakfast cereals and porridges, sweetened bread products, main meals and sandwiches.

Items within these categories are then evaluated using a scoring tool to determine if they're ""less healthy"" based on nutrient content and whether they're high in saturated fat, salt or sugar. Only products meeting both criteria fall under the restrictions.

Firms are still permitted to promote healthier alternatives of banned products, which the government hopes will push the food industry towards reformulating their recipes.
Kids to be banned from buying high-caffeine drinks

The government has unveiled plans to prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under 16. Officials said evidence demonstrates links between these drinks and harmful effects on children's physical and mental wellbeing, sleep quality and educational performance.

About 100,000 youngsters drink at least one high-caffeine energy drink every day. When announcing the ban in September, the government stated the measure could prevent obesity in up to 40,000 children and generate health benefits worth tens of millions of pounds.

The government is considering a ban on the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks, containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, to under-16s. The proposed law would apply to all retailers, including online stores, shops, restaurants, cafes and vending machines, but wouldn't impact lower-caffeine soft drinks, tea or coffee.

Public consultation on the proposal concluded on November 26. While the ban has yet to be legislated, if it progresses, it could be implemented as early as 2026.
Prison reforms are on the horizon

The proposed changes could limit the use of short-term imprisonment and expand community punishments to reduce the number of people being incarcerated.

The Sentencing Bill, currently progressing through Parliament, includes a proposal for an earned release scheme inspired by Texas. Under this scheme, inmates demonstrating good behaviour could be released earlier, while those breaking rules could face extended jail time.

For instance, prisoners might serve a minimum of a third of their term for good behaviour, but could receive up to three months additional jail time for violence or possession of prohibited items like mobile phones.

The proposed ""earned progression model"" will only be applicable to prisoners serving standard determinate sentences. The model won't extend to dangerous offenders, and those serving extended determinate sentences or life sentences will continue to serve their current durations.

Upon release, offenders will face a new phase of ""intensive supervision"", resulting in tens of thousands more offenders being tagged and a significant increase in home detentions.

There are also plans to replace prison sentences of a year or less with stricter community sentences. The government believes this approach will ""better punish offenders and stop them reoffending"".

While these reforms have yet to become law, they're anticipated to take effect next year.
Major changes in employment law bring new rights for workers

A host of new laws are on the horizon for UK workers following the Royal Assent of major legislation at the close of 2025. The government has stated that over 15 million people will benefit from new protections under the Employment Rights Act.

These measures will be introduced gradually over a two-year period, with changes expected in April and October.

From April, an increased number of workers will be able to take sick leave without pay concerns as the government is bolstering statutory sick pay. The lower earnings limit will be abolished along with the waiting period, meaning workers will be entitled to sick pay from their first day on the job.

In the same month, there will be changes for new parents, with workers gaining the right to paternity pay and unpaid parental leave from their first day on the job. Stronger redundancy rights are also anticipated in the spring.

From October, employers will be banned from using 'fire and rehire' and 'fire and replace' tactics. Dismissals due to refusal to agree to a change in certain core contractual terms will be deemed automatically unfair, except in specific special circumstances.

The government is also set to introduce changes to tighten tipping laws and combat sexual harassment in the workplace. Employers will also need to adhere to new rules regarding trade unions, including informing workers of their right to join one and introducing new protections for union representatives.

Further changes expected to be implemented in 2027 include new rights for pregnant workers, a new right to unpaid bereavement leave, including for pregnancy loss, alterations to flexible working policies and the termination of zero-hour contracts.
Tax relief for those working from home is set to end

From April 6, individuals working from home will no longer be able to claim tax relief for their additional expenses. At present, certain employees can claim a deduction on their income tax for the extra household costs incurred while working from home, such as increased bills and business phone calls.

The claimable amount can either be based on actual expenditure, with proof, or at a fixed rate of £6 per week without needing receipts. However, employees whose costs are reimbursed by their employer are not eligible for this relief.

The Budget revealed that this tax relief would cease on April 6 2026.

The government estimated that about 300,000 people will be affected by the removal of this tax relief, resulting in a tax increase of around £62 for basic rate taxpayers and £124 for higher rate taxpayers.

In other news, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is set to receive new 'modern fraud prevention powers' that will enable debt collectors to directly withdraw money from bank accounts.

This legislation, which has now been passed through parliament, will allow the DWP to clamp down on fraudsters, recover overpayments, and safeguard taxpayers' money, according to the government.

The new legislation means benefit fraudsters who have the means to repay but refuse could see money owed deducted directly from their bank accounts. The DWP will also be empowered to seek court orders suspending driving licences for claimants owing welfare debts exceeding £1,000 who have repeatedly ignored repayment demands.

Under these fresh powers, the DWP will obtain data from banks to help ensure benefit recipients are receiving correct payments and aren't falling into debt or making fraudulent claims.

The government has made clear that no personal information will be shared by the DWP and the department will not have access to bank accounts for verifying eligibility for benefits or to see where people are spending their money.

Minister for transformation Andrew Western stated: ""The powers granted through the Bill will allow us to better identify, prevent and deter fraud and error, and enable the better recovery of debt owed to the taxpayer.""

The changes, due to be implemented from 2026, are projected to save taxpayers £1.5 billion by 2029/2030, according to the government.
Minimum wage to rise

Minimum wage will rise again in April 2026.

The National Living Wage, the minimum wage rate for all workers aged 21 and over, will rise by 4.1 per cent to £12.71 per hour. The minimum wage for people aged between 18 and 20 will increase to £10.85 and the rate for 16 and 17 year olds will increase to £8.00.

The government has announced the rate increase will deliver ""a real-terms pay rise for low-paid workers"" and represents a step forward in bringing the rate for 18 to 20 year olds in line with the National Living Wage.

From April 2026, the new rates will be:.

National Living Wage (21 and over): £12.71 per hour - up 50p.

Rate for age 18-20: £10.85 per hour - up 85p.

Rate for age 16-17: £8.00 per hour - up 45p.

Apprentice Rate: £8.00 per hour - up 45p.
Significant changes for renters coming this May

Major reforms are set to take effect for those renting homes in England. From May 1, new legislation will be introduced which the government claims will provide 11 million renters with ""stronger rights, better protections and more security in their homes"".

Private tenants will no longer live with the threat of receiving a Section 21 'no-fault' eviction notice. The government states this practice currently leaves thousands of tenants at risk of homelessness each year.

Landlords will retain the ability to reclaim their property for legitimate reasons – including selling the property, moving in themselves, or addressing rent arrears or anti-social behaviour.

Fixed-term contracts are also being scrapped by the government. All private rental tenancies will transition to rolling arrangements on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis without a fixed end date.

Renters will also gain protection from excessive rent increases, with landlords restricted to raising rent just once annually. Tenants will have the right to dispute unreasonable above-market increases.

The days of bidding wars are numbered as landlords will be required to adhere to the advertised rental price when finalising a contract, and they'll be prohibited from demanding more than one month's rent in advance.

Landlords will also lose the right to unjustly deny a tenant's request for a pet, and it will become unlawful to reject tenants on the grounds of having children or receiving benefits. The government plans to issue guidance for tenants ahead of these changes, which come into effect on May 1.

Further amendments are anticipated later in the year A new register of all landlords and rental properties in England is set to be introduced by the government, enabling tenants to verify their landlords' identities. This online database will be gradually implemented by region starting from late 2026.

Additionally, a private landlord ombudsman will be established to assist renters in resolving complaints against landlords swiftly and fairly, without resorting to court proceedings.
Extension of Awaab's Law

A law enacted following the tragic death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak, who died from a respiratory condition caused by prolonged exposure to mould in social housing in Rochdale, may be extended in 2026.

Awaab's Law, which mandates social housing providers to rectify reported hazards within a specified timeframe and relocate tenants to safe accommodation if necessary, came into force in October 2025.

The government is now pushing to roll out Awaab's Law across the private rental market, compelling landlords to act swiftly when properties become unsafe. Ministers will launch a consultation on these proposals in the coming months.

The new regulations for social housing stipulate that emergency health and safety hazards must be rectified within 24 hours of being flagged, whilst serious damp and mould issues require investigation within 10 working days of notification. Housing providers then have an additional five days to render properties safe.
Reselling tickets above face value set to be outlawed

Ministers have unveiled fresh legislation that will prohibit ticket touts from flogging tickets for more than their face value. The new regulations will ""destroy the operating model of ticket touts"" and slash the cost of resale tickets for enthusiasts of live entertainment, according to the government.

The forthcoming law will criminalise the resale of tickets to gigs, theatre productions, comedy shows, sporting fixtures and other live events for prices exceeding their original cost. This follows widespread fury from fans over touts bulk-buying tickets and hawking them at vastly inflated prices, pricing out genuine supporters from attending events.

Ministers claim the ban will cut resale ticket prices by an average of £37 for fans, collectively saving them £112 million annually. The new regulations aim not only to save fans money, but also to improve their access to initial ticket sales by preventing touts from using automated bots to snap up tickets in bulk.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated: ""The UK is home to a brilliant range of music, entertainers and sporting stars – but when fans are shut out - it only benefits the touts. That's why we're taking these bold measures to smash their model to pieces and make sure more fans can enjoy their favourite stars at a fair price.""

The proposals must pass through Parliament before becoming law, but if approved, fans could see the changes implemented by 2026.
2027 and beyond....

Several new laws that have dominated discussions throughout 2025 are not scheduled to take effect until later.

From spring 2027, the UK will implement a prohibition on wet wipe sales as part of efforts to combat plastic pollution. The legislation bans the supply and sale of all wet wipes containing plastic.

Whilst the new law applies to England, the Welsh Government has already enacted similar legislation, with Scotland and Northern Ireland expected to follow suit.

Wet wipes containing plastic can fragment into microplastics that harm wildlife and contaminate the food chain. Plastic-free alternatives are widely available, and numerous retailers have already ceased selling plastic-containing wet wipes in anticipation of the incoming regulations.

Stricter anti-terror regulations will be implemented under Martyn's Law, named in honour of 29-year-old Martyn Hett who tragically lost his life in the Manchester Arena bombing. The new legislation will mandate venues hosting 200 or more people to prepare for a potential terror attack.

my system is a few years old but I am on a 3 weeks holiday break now and would love to get into OCing again for more FPS and just because I can with the cooling I have.

**I am currently OCing a 9900k on a Z390 Waterforce.** I followed this guide here: [https://forums.bit-tech.net/index.php?threads/9900k-5ghz-1-2v-guide-gigabyte-z390-master-5-2ghz-1-28v-guide-pg2.353729/page-2](https://forums.bit-tech.net/index.php?threads/9900k-5ghz-1-2v-guide-gigabyte-z390-master-5-2ghz-1-28v-guide-pg2.353729/page-2) and my results are as schown in the screenshot. 

**Got an avg temp of 87ish and my Voltage is around 1.255V at 5GHz.**   
But, even though I set my Core Ratio to 52 it only operates at 50. May this be caused by the AVX Offset 2 in the Bios settings? To fix this I would need to up my Vcore right? Which in turn ends up in higher temps on the cores which could lead into throttling? Would love to hear from some more experienced people

**My water temperature is seen in HWInfo at ""PCH Temperature"".** I have a huge loop with **three 480mm and one 360mm.**   
  
My **1080ti is also watercooled** and I want to OC her in the next step too. Would use afterburner if it's still a good tool to do so. **And then try to get 2000+ MHz.** 

**DRAM runs on normal X.M.P. at 3600MHz** as also seen in the screenshot. Never overclocked my DRAM so far, so not sure about that.

Water temps overall shouldnt be a problem so I want to get as much out of my 9900k and 1080ti as possible.

What would be your next steps? Trying to up the vcore so I reach maybe the 5.2.GHz and maybe increasing the LLC if it becomes unstable?

How am I faring so far with this OC? More to gain?

Thanks in advance for any advise :)

I’m 38. I make $11K a year. I saved up as much as I could, skipping meals, because it was a rough emotional year for a lot of my friends.

I managed to buy everyone a gift! It wasn’t super expensive but like a hoodie for a friend, a playdoh kitchen kit for her daughter, a ms Rachel doll for my other friend’s child, coffee mugs for my friend who has a coffee mug collection. My kids got paints and art supplies and a couple books. My other friends got cat-coffee mugs, and specialty coffee because they’re both obsessed with coffee and share five cats.

I didn’t spend a lot, but I was thoughtful and picked good quality small gifts but gifts!

You know what I got? Literally the only present I got this year: 

One person printed a meme out on printer paper and handed it to me.

Christmas always goes like this for me and after years of someone or other pointing out I had nothing to open I had started wrapping gifts I pick out for myself so I could at least skip that awkward, but I didn’t have a lot of money this year so I wrapped up a bag of dried pinto beans so I could unwrap it and sneak it away and pretend I got something (so if anyone looked over they’d see me unwrap something and wouldn’t ask if I stayed quiet enough in the background.

Thankfully it worked and I didn’t have the awkward sitting there while everyone realized they forgot me and promised my gift would come (it won’t) and made excuses. 

Christmas and holidays always have a way of reminding me that I don’t belong. And I’m mad that it bothers me because I’m 38 and yeah I missed out on Christmas/birthday/halloween/all kinds of joyful childhood experiences, but I’m a grown up now and this shouldn’t bother me any more.

My youngest is in 6th grade. He turns 12 in 2026. I figure after 12th grade he’ll go to university or a trade school or whatever and I’ll move to the mountains and live in a shack in the woods and I won’t have to think about holidays much anymore. I’ll see my kids on school breaks and I’ll talk to them as much as they’ll let me and I’ll get them gifts for Christmas and birthday, but I won’t have the awkward holiday events you have to put up with when you have little ones.",3,1766772470.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

1pwanwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pwanwp/my_27f_boyfriends_27m_family_actively_hate_me/,My (27F) boyfriend’s (27M) family actively hate me,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 3 years. I have been in multiple long term relationships in the past, but I am my boyfriend’s first relationship ever. We have been living together since August and have been very happy. His family have met me once for less than 24 hours until now in the whole time we have been together.

Last Christmas, he wanted me to come visit his family for a couple of days over the holiday. We live in a different state so it’s a 7ish hour drive between the city my boyfriend and I live in and where his family live. His family never explicitly said no but kept changing their plans and the days I was allowed to come until ultimately saying that they did not want me to be there. My boyfriend was upset but I was ultimately fine with it since I got to spend time with my dad who was visiting from out of state. It turns out that for the entire week my boyfriend was with his family, his parents were telling him that he needs to break up with me. They don’t like me for a variety of reasons (and in my opinion keep changing the goalposts about what they envision for his perfect partner). Some examples: I am too shy, I’m too outspoken/loud, I have depression and anxiety that I am on medication and in therapy for to help cope, I have a family history of breast cancer, etc 

The result of this was that my boyfriend became very conflicted about our relationship. He obviously cares about his family and their opinions, but he also recognizes that the issues they have with me are ultimately either not who he knows me to be or things that are not within my control. What matters to him is that I am aware of and open with him about mental health/family history, and following all guidelines for what a person should do to try and work with those challenges. He went through a lot of emotional issues and ultimately did end up breaking up with me in March. He asked to come over a week later to pick up some things and ultimately asked to get back together. His friends in our city that he has lived with and I have spent quite a bit of time with were absolutely shocked he had broken up with me and literally asked if he thought there was any chance I would take him back. 

Since then my boyfriend and I have each done a lot of individual work with our separate therapists, have had a lot of honest conversations about what needs to change about how we approach emotional challenges, and what we actually envision for our lives and how those plans fit together. I can honestly say that he and I are stronger and happier now. He moved in with me and is an excellent partner in all the ways that matter to me. He says I am one of the best things in his life and I hope I can continue to support him and make memories together.

As one can imagine, his family have thoughts. His parents were so happy to hear that he had followed their “advice” and broken up with me. They have since been more or less silent about us getting back together and moving in. For this Christmas, my boyfriend told them explicitly that he wants them to spend time with me since he feels that this is a relationship that could last. We drove up on Christmas Eve and are planning to be here until the 30th. Each day his parents pull him into their bedroom or take him for a ride in the car to do errands and spend 1+ hours telling him why they don’t like me. He then has to come to me, after obviously crying and trying to get his parents to just BE HAPPY FOR HIM, to tell me what they said so I can try to be less of a nuisance or whatever. I am trying to support him because I could honestly care less about having a relationship of any kind with these people, but it is obviously important to my boyfriend. I have and will continue to be cordial and try to be a good houseguest. 

Here is a list of things that I did wrong so far:
- was offering my opinion too loudly about what I understood while trying to explain the rules of a board game with the family that none of us had played
- the Christmas present I gave them (pictures of my boyfriend and myself in a frame) was too much (my boyfriend told me that they would like this present and helped me pick out the pictures)
- I brought some of my family’s Christmas cookies to share (in their words, “like we need more cookies”)
- the Christmas card my boyfriend and I designed and chose to send out together was an overstep on my part (evidence that I’m controlling my boyfriend apparently)
- my boyfriend and I woke up early this morning to go get coffee and watch the sunrise (my dad wanted to talk to me on the phone because he’s worried for my safety in this situation 😅)

My boyfriend and his parents are currently on a “grocery run” to the store 5 minutes away and have been gone for over an hour so far. I just know what’s happening right now. What I would appreciate is any advice someone who has been in this or a similar situation have. How do I navigate the next few days in a way that keeps the peace and supports my boyfriend? I truly do love him and feel bad for him being put in this place. He told me yesterday that I’m worth it, but that doesn’t mean that I can’t try to help him as well.

Thanks in advance and happy holidays to everyone out there!",1,1766772309.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

i'd love some feedback from you all

long story short: i got involved with a sagittarius woman, who was (at the time) a co-worker of mine who's in a long distance relationship. she's bored with her boyfriend, wanted to open her relationship to date me, but we ended up fooling around a couple of times before that. things got messy, with a lot of back and forth especially from me, and we stepped back from the sexual/romantic fling

we kept things friendly since we were part of the same group of colleagues/friends, but she'd always hint at something romantic when i was moving on

she finally got a job in another city, so i quietly moved on and left her behind until a few weeks ago. she texted our group chat asking for our thanksgiving plans bc she'd visit out town. i already had something, so said so. then, she announced she'd be here two weeks prior to that - and i scheduled a trip to another state to avoid bumping into her. i liked the message in the chat and didn't say anything

fast forward to the week of her visit. she directly texts me, saying to ""let her know if i would like to meet for coffee or just hangout with our friends."" i told her i wouldn't be around in the weekend, but wished her lots of fun and next time i'd join. this was **wednesday around 3pm**

next day, **thursday at 11am**, she texts the group again, saying: ""hey all, plans changed and i arrived in town earlier. i canceled my class (she's a professor) and will be here from today until sunday x"" man, i swear i felt in my gut she came earlier to try to see me... i didn't even open the message, and decided to cut her off after this

lo and behold, when i'm leaving the building i was working that day, who i see at the stairs? yeah that woman... with her past coordinator and a random girl. i briefly stopped by, greeted everyone, and ran away as if my life depended on it

didn't open the group chat and of course she directly texted me on monday after my silence. she was upset at how weird was bumping into each other at work and how sad she was because she couldn't keep in touch with me and another colleague (both of us didn't reply to the group chat). she asked if everything was all right between us. after thinking about it, i said our fling was toxic as hell and that i'd step back from our connection. but wished her well and hoped she understand

she blamed me for being hot & cold, and wish me well too. then, i blocked her and left the group chat

1pwanes,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDFamily/comments/1pwanes/resentment_towards_my_parents/,Resentment towards my parents.,"My older sister (pwsBPD) has always been enabled by my parents. During one of her outbursts, she kicked me out of her wedding and uninvited my parents and me - going as far as cancelling our hotel reservations and removing all mention of us as family on her wedding site. 

This was the final straw for me, but my parents went right back when she called my mom crying that she felt like she ruined our family (of course, no apology). Right before the wedding, my dad went to my therapy appointment with me, where I told him my boundaries: (1) they need to accept that I will go NC with her; (2) I don't want to hear anything about her, her dogs, her boyfriend, etc.; (3) I don't want them to tell her anything about me. He understood and accepted all of them. They went to the wedding and I stayed home. 

I face timed my parents on Christmas morning to wish them a Merry Christmas and to confirm plans for them to come over later for coffee/dessert. My dad immediately turns the phone around to show my new brother-in-law sitting there and says, ""say hello to \[bil\]!"". I couldn't get off the phone fast enough. I called him back and said that was not okay. He said that I needed say hello to be polite...so I cancelled our plans.

1pwan7l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pwan7l,Banff Xmas Ski Trip Report & Tips,"Just spent about a week skiing at Banff and Lake Louise! We’re incredibly lucky with the snow this year, especially coming from Seattle where the ski season has a pretty bad start. It was a really magical, white Christmas. Here’s our trip report and some tips that hopefully helps others plan their trip.

Day 1: Canmore & Banff

\- Picked up rental car from Avis at the airport (got snow tires).

\- Canmore Engine bridge and Bow River, then coffee at Rocky Mountain Bagel Company 

\- Lake Minnewanka

\- Dinner at Zyka (Indian food)

\- Used the pool and spa at the Kenrick hotel where we stayed. 

Day 2: Banff Sunshine

\- Breakfast at Analog Coffee

\- First day of skiing with a little bit of fresh powder. Gondola to the Village starts 8am, but lifts from the Village don’t start until 9am. 

\- Stopped by Mount Norquay Lookout 

\- Dinner at The Fat Ox for happy hour 

\- Pool and spa at hotel

Day 3: Banff Sunshine & Johnston Canyon

\- Joined the free guided mountain tour with Snow Hosts. It was very helpful and they showed us runs we didn’t even know existed. Especially helpful for avoiding flats. Wish we did it on our first day.  

\- Hiked at Johnston Canyon, only to the lower falls since we were pretty tired from skiing

\- Stopped by Lake Louise & Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise 

\- Dinner at Post Hotel Norman Lounge

\- Stayed at Mountaineer Lodge. We got the Deluxe king room here which was nice and spacious. They have free breakfast, food was okay nothing special. 

Day 4: Lake Louise Ski Resor

\- Took the First Tracks Private Ski Lesson. It was the best and cheapest ski lesson I’ve taken, the cost covers 2 people, we learned techniques to ski in deep powder, and did some tree runs as well.

\- Hung out at the Polar Ice Palace at the base, and had hot chocolate (it was so delicious!)

\- Drove back to Banff for the evening and got a snack at Yama Onigiri

\- Dinner at Shoku Izakaya. Sushi here was surprisingly good. 

\- Walked around the quieter side streets in Banff. Bought some gifts at Jolene’s Tea House and Paper Den stationery store 

Day 5: Lake Louise Ski Resort

\- Joined a free guided mountain tour of Lake Louise with Ski Friends.

\- Lunch at Whitehorn Bistro

\- Used the hot tub at Mountaineer Lodge.

\- Dinner at Post Hotel. Amazing food, great vibe, excellent service. Swanky but in a cozy way. Really feels like a Christmas storybook experience.

Day 6: Final ski day and Canmore

\- Skiied mostly on the backside of Lake Louise

\- Lunch at Yama Onigiri, again

\- Spent the afternoon at Everwild Nordic Spa Price is very steep, but Kananaskis was already sold out.

\- Dinner at Korilla Korean BBQ. This is one of the best kbbq I’ve had in North America. 

\- Stayed at The Dorian hotel in Calgary. Got upgraded to the king suite which was nice. Downtown Calgary seemed pretty dead, in hindsight we would not bother staying there (parking was expensive too)

Thanks for reading and happy to answer questions!

Tips:

\- Do the free mountain tours at the ski resorts! You need to be comfortable on blue runs. The guides are fantastic and it’s nice to meet other people and hear where they’re from and where they have skiied. 

\- Overall we definitely preferred Lake Louise over Banff Sushine. Banff had a lot more flat areas and uphills that were easy to get stuck in. It also seemed generally busier than Lake Louise.

\- Bring your own food to the ski resorts. At Sunshine they provide microwaves to heat up your own packed lunches. We saved a lot of time and money this way.

\- Weather forecast is very unreliable. We had mostly cloudy days, 1 heavy blizzard day, 1 bluebird day. Despite cloudy days, visibility was surprisingly good on the mountains

\- Sunrise is super late (around 9am!) and sunset is early (around 4:30pm). Also the sun stays very low to the horizon or is blocked by mountains so generally there is very little sun light. 

\- Driving after dark can be difficult because there are no highway lights and snow on the road makes lanes almost invisible. ",7,1766772261.0,Banff,1,1.0,False

I’m a 34-year-old guy from Bangalore who’s hoping to meet a few genuine, kind people to talk to and slowly build a real connection, whether that turns into a friendship, something meaningful or simply two people who enjoy each other’s company.

I’m more on the introverted and thoughtful side. I enjoy calm conversations, random topics, late-night chats, walks, coffee, music, movies and just those simple moments that feel comforting rather than complicated. I’m not someone who’s loud or flashy. I value sincerity, emotional awareness, and people who can just be themselves without pressure.

Life has taught me to slow down, be more present and focus on quality over quantity, including when it comes to people. I’m not here for games, ghosting or superficial chats. I genuinely enjoy getting to know someone over time, sharing thoughts, laughing at random things and creating a space where both people feel comfortable being real.

If you’re someone who appreciates easy conversations, good vibes and calm energy and you’re open to seeing where a genuine connection can grow, I’d really love to hear from you.

Feel free to drop a message telling me a little about you, and what you’re hoping to find here. 😊

What does this mean for me? I always pay off my card on time and in full. The thing I am worried about this meaning is that they are adding fees to the purchases I make with my card.

i'd love some feedback from you all

long story short: i got involved with a (at the time) co-worker of mine who's in a long distance relationship. she's bored with the guy, wanted to open her relationship to date me, but we ended up fooling around a couple of times before that. things got messy, with a lot of back and forth especially from me, and we stepped back from the sexual/romantic fling

we kept things friendly since we were part of the same group of colleagues/friends, but she'd always hint at something romantic when i was moving on

she finally got a job in another city, so i quietly moved on and left her behind until a few weeks ago. she texted our group chat asking for our thanksgiving plans bc she'd visit out town. i already had something, so said so. then, she announced she'd be here two weeks prior to that - and i scheduled a trip to another state to avoid bumping into her. i liked the message in the chat and didn't say anything

fast forward to the week of her visit. she directly texts me, saying to ""let her know if i would like to meet for coffee or just hangout with our friends."" i told her i wouldn't be around in the weekend, but wished her lots of fun and next time i'd join. this was **wednesday around 3pm**

Many drippers, grinders, roasters, scales, filters, baskets, etc. Many are awesome products, some were busts. These are the my top 6 favorite products that I enjoyed using the most... in no particular order. 

1. Nucleus Link : This sample roaster really elevated my home roasting experience. I get to sample and experience all kinds of beans, even Hacienda La Esmeralda Geisha without being scared of messing up.

2. Timemore 078: I am late to the party on this one, but this has become my favorite filter grinder. It replaced the Mazzer Philos on the roster.

3. Subminimal Subscale: I just love the workflow and convenience of the design of this scale.

4. Generic Plastic Filter Paper Presser : This was the best $6 Aliexpress item. It is very helpful in making our filter paper sit in drippers nice and neat. It is well made with some weight.

5. The Better Vessel: We appreciate innovation and experimentation. We are coffee nerds. It is in our nature. This was used in the 2025 World Barista Championship in Milan to get the highest rated espresso. It takes the crema off the espresso. Might not be everyone's cup of tea but it gives another espresso experience. This is just their prototype. I am excited to get their Tritan production version. 

6. Out $25 Coffee Neon Sign from Temu : it makes our coffee corner looks cool and I expected to last a week... but it 6 months in, it is still shining bright.

I’ve worked for Fortune 50s (not 500) as well as medium size companies and a few small ones. I had a blazing career till I got laid off. Company penthouse in one of the most premium gated societies of Bangaluru, company luxury car, very comfortable salary and etc etc.

And then one morning my colleague from HR called me and asked if I could meet her outside the office. We met and she informed me that I was being let go. Corporate restructuring - the usual suspect. 

We sat there drinking our coffees and I was in shock. 25 years IT career - gone in 30 seconds. 

I was given 6 months of pay, a certificate saying how good an employee i was and a company t-shirt. And I was out. No backup plan.

I started looking for jobs. There were none available for a 50 year old guy. I felt like a dinosaur. A fossil.

Somewhere along the way I started experimenting with Gemini AI. I was always interested in the stock market so I started to learn about it with the AI’s help. I had no experience and I started from absolute zero knowledge.

I started with Rs 500. Invested in a mutual fund. Slowly and surely, I got more confident in investing and started investing more and more.

I used the Gemini AI and the Groww app and started investing in Metals and minerals which are used in tech like AI, EVs and others, My portfolio exploded.

Now I am making an insane amount of money. On good days I make about 5% per day and I don't need a job. I am earning more than I would from a salary.

I am so grateful to AI for helping e find something I enjoy. I just wanted to share this so that somebody like like can find it helpful too.

It is never too late to find something that you love. Getting laid off taught me this.

I laughed uncomfortably and then said “ok, have a nice day” and he said “are you good?” like he wanted to walk me home or something?! I said “yea” and walked out.

Why would you tell a young woman you’ve been watching her?! Ughhh now I’m so sad because I don’t want to use my giftcard anymore and I still have money on it. I’ll probably go to a different shop across town to use it if anything because he freaked me out!

We got our cat from the shelter she was about 3 or 4 months old and had already spent half of her life in the shelter, so we knew she already had some serious trauma.

When we got her she quickly bonded with our other cat and he became the love of her life. However when it comes to me and my wife, she would run away from us as soon as we are less than 6 feet away from her.

 In the first year she spends most of her days under the bed or under the very low coffee table. The only time I could touch her was when she is hiding under the coffee table. I would pet her (very awkward and tight space to put my hand thru, but it worked) and she actually enjoyed it since she sleep on her side and expose her behind to me to pet it more. At night, she would sleep on our bed (most likely following our other cat, since she never is there without him being there), but about once a week she would pee on us while sleeping. my wife wanted to take her back to shelter, but I refused.



 The peeing in bed eventually stopped. not sure how, but we did shoo her away anytime we woke up to her in bed, so maybe this helped keep her away from bed, and also our other cat stopped sleeping in bed with us for some reason. she did find other places in the house to pee in, but it became must less frequent. she only did it once in the last 6 months and it was in an open shipping box ... so not as bed as peeing in bed on us. 



Fast forward to now, over three years later, she is comfortable to sleep in the open on the cat beds and sofas and sometimes even if we are in the same room with her. However she still run away from us when we get closer than 3 feet from her. Once in a blue moon she actually let us pet her for a few seconds without any ""protection"".

Trying to catch her for vet visits or the occasional hotel visits (only twice so far) is an absolute nightmare and if we don't plan it very carefully and cunningly, it is not going to happen.

So we have seen progress but it is very slow.

25M, 2 months ago my entire family had given up on me.

Not in a dramatic way where they cut me off or kicked me out. Worse than that. They just stopped expecting anything from me. Stopped asking about my life. Stopped inviting me to things. I became a ghost in my own family.

I was living in a one bedroom apartment that my parents were helping pay for because I could barely afford it on my own. I was working at a call center making $15 an hour, same job I’d had since I was 21. Four years in the same dead end position taking angry calls from customers about their internet bills or whatever.

I had no ambition, no goals, no plan. Just coasting through life doing the absolute minimum to survive. I’d wake up 10 minutes before my shift, log in from bed, take calls for 8 hours while browsing Reddit and YouTube, clock out, then spend the rest of the night gaming or scrolling until 3 or 4am.

My apartment was a mess. Dishes piled up for weeks. Trash overflowing. Laundry everywhere. I’d order delivery food every single day because I was too lazy to cook or even go to a store. Just lived in my own filth and didn’t care.

I had no friends. Everyone from high school and college had moved on with their lives. They had real jobs, relationships, apartments they actually paid for themselves, futures they were building. I had nothing. Just the same routine every day going nowhere.

My family knew how pathetic I was. My younger brother was 23 and already had a real career in finance, his own place, a girlfriend, actual ambition. My sister was 27, married, just bought a house, talking about having kids. And then there was me, 25, still needing my parents help to pay rent, working the same shit job I’d had since college dropout.

The thing is, my family used to check in on me. My mom would call and ask how work was going, if I was looking for new jobs, if I wanted to come over for dinner. My dad would text asking if I needed anything or if I wanted to grab lunch. My siblings would invite me to hang out.

But over time they just stopped. My mom would call less and less. My dad’s texts became less frequent. My siblings stopped inviting me to things. It wasn’t mean or intentional, they just accepted that I wasn’t going to change and stopped wasting energy trying to help me.

I noticed it gradually. I’d see my family group chat and they’d be making plans without me. My brother would post about family dinners I wasn’t invited to. My sister would have gatherings at her new house and I wouldn’t hear about it until after. They’d adapted to me not being present even when I was technically part of the family.

The silent disappointment was worse than if they’d just yelled at me or told me I was fucking up. At least that would’ve meant they still cared enough to be angry. Instead they just looked at me with this resigned sadness, like they’d mourned who I could have been and accepted who I actually was.

## The conversation that changed everything

Two months ago there was a family birthday party for my mom. I almost didn’t go because I knew it would be awkward, but I forced myself to show up because it was her birthday.

I got there late. Everyone was already eating and talking and laughing. When I walked in the energy shifted. Not in an obvious way, just a subtle change. People said hi but it felt obligatory. My mom hugged me but it was brief. Everyone went back to their conversations and I just kind of stood there.

I spent most of the party on my phone in the corner. My brother was talking about a promotion he just got. My sister was showing everyone pictures of renovations they were doing on their house. My cousins were talking about trips they’d taken and things they were doing. I had nothing to contribute. No updates, no achievements, no stories. Just the same life I’d been living for 4 years.

At one point I overheard my aunt ask my mom “how’s he doing?” in that concerned tone, and my mom just said “he’s fine” in a way that clearly meant she didn’t want to talk about it. That moment fucking hurt. Being talked about like I was a problem child who never grew up.

After everyone left I was helping clean up and my dad asked if he could talk to me outside. We sat on the back porch and he was quiet for a minute, just looking out at the yard.

Then he said “I need to be honest with you about something and I’m sorry if it hurts. We’ve given up on you.”

I didn’t say anything, just waited for him to continue.

“Your mom and I, your brother and sister, we all love you but we don’t know what to do anymore. We’ve tried to help, tried to encourage you, tried to be supportive, and nothing changes. You’re 25 years old and you’re living the exact same life you were living at 21. Same job, same apartment we help pay for, same lack of direction. We’re exhausted.”

He wasn’t angry, he was just tired. That’s what made it worse.

“We don’t invite you to things anymore because you either don’t show up or you show up and you’re just on your phone not really present. We don’t ask about your life because there’s never anything new to talk about. We’ve accepted that this is who you are and we’re trying to make peace with it, but it’s hard watching our son waste his life.”

I felt my chest get tight. I wanted to defend myself but I had no defense. Everything he said was true.

“I’m not telling you this to be cruel. I’m telling you because I think you need to hear it. We’ve given up on expecting you to change, but I hope you haven’t given up on yourself. Because if you have, this is your life forever. This job, this apartment, being the family member everyone’s worried about but nobody knows how to help. Is that what you want?”

I said no.

“Then you need to do something about it. Not tomorrow, not next week, now. Because we can’t do it for you. We’ve tried and it doesn’t work. You’re the only person who can unfuck your life, and I’m begging you to do it before it’s too late.”

He went back inside and I sat there for like an hour just processing. The image of myself through their eyes was devastating. The disappointment, the exhaustion, the resignation. I’d become the family burden and I hadn’t even fully realized it.

I drove home that night and looked around my apartment. The mess, the delivery containers, my laptop set up for another night of gaming, my phone ready for hours of scrolling. This was my entire existence and it was pathetic.

I thought about being 30, 35, 40, still living like this. Still needing help from my parents. Still being the disappointment everyone had given up on. Still having nothing to show for my life. That vision of my future terrified me more than anything ever had.

That night I decided I was going to completely reset my life in 60 days. Not because I was motivated or inspired, but because I was terrified of staying who I was.

## What I did in the next 60 days

The next morning I started looking for a plan, a system, anything that could give me structure because I clearly couldn’t create it myself. I found this app called Reload on Reddit that builds personalized 60 day plans based on your current situation.

I downloaded it skeptically but filled out the questions honestly. What time do you wake up now? Noon. How often do you work out? Never. What’s your daily routine? Work from bed, game, scroll, sleep at 4am. It built a plan starting from my actual pathetic baseline, not some ideal version of myself.

Week one was small changes. Wake up at 10am instead of noon. Do 20 minute workouts 3 times. Spend 30 minutes looking at job postings. Clean apartment once. That’s it. But it covered everything, sleep, exercise, job hunting, cleaning, learning, all structured day by day with gradual increases each week.

The app also blocked all the time wasting apps and websites during focus hours. When Reddit and YouTube won’t open, you can’t waste 6 hours scrolling without realizing it. That forced discipline saved my life.

By week three I was waking at 8am, working out 5 times a week, applying to jobs daily, keeping my apartment clean. By week six I was waking at 7am, doing hour long workouts, had a new job lined up. By week eight I was a completely different person.

## I quit the call center and got a real job

Three weeks in I started applying to actual jobs. Not call centers, real positions with career paths and growth potential. Applied to probably 80 companies over a month. Got rejected from most. But I got 6 interviews and two offers.

I took a customer success role at a tech startup, $52k base plus equity and benefits. More than triple what I was making at the call center. I’d be working with actual teams, learning real skills, having opportunities to grow.

The interview they asked why I wanted to leave my current role and I was honest. I told them I’d been stuck in the same position for 4 years because I had no ambition or drive, but something clicked recently and I realized I was wasting my life. I said I’m looking for somewhere I can actually build a career instead of just collecting a paycheck.

They appreciated the honesty. Hired me on the spot.

Starting that job gave me structure, better income, and actual purpose. I was learning things, contributing to projects, working with people who had ambition. Being around driven people made me want to be driven too.

## I fixed my relationship with my family

Four weeks into my transformation I called my dad and asked if we could talk. We met for coffee and I told him everything I’d been doing. The early wake ups, the workouts, the job applications, the new job I’d just accepted, the structure I’d built.

He looked skeptical at first, like he’d heard me make promises before. But I showed him my workout logs, my daily routine, the offer letter from the new company. Proof that this time was different.

He said “I’m proud of you for taking this seriously. I hope you stick with it.”

I told him I know you’ve given up on me and I don’t blame you, but I haven’t given up on myself. I’m going to prove to you that I can be someone you’re proud of.

Two months later my relationship with my family is completely different. My mom calls me regularly again and actually sounds happy to talk to me. My dad texts asking how the new job is going. My siblings invite me to things and I actually show up and participate.

Last week there was a family dinner and my brother mentioned in front of everyone that I’d lost like 20 pounds and looked way healthier. My sister asked about my new job and seemed genuinely interested in what I was doing. My mom pulled me aside and said “I can see the change in you, you seem happier.”

I’m not the ghost anymore. I’m present. I’m part of the family again. Not because they suddenly decided to include me, but because I became someone worth including.

## What actually changed in 60 days:

The surface changes are obvious. Better job making $52k instead of $15 an hour. Wake up at 6:30am instead of noon. Work out 6 days a week. Apartment stays clean. I actually cook instead of ordering delivery every day.

But the real change is how I see myself and how my family sees me.

I’m not the disappointment anymore. I’m not the one everyone’s given up on. I’m not the burden they don’t know how to help. I’m the son who figured his shit out. The brother who’s actually doing something with his life. The family member who shows up and participates.

My dad told me two weeks ago that he and my mom talk about how proud they are of the change I’ve made. He said “we didn’t think you had it in you to be honest, but you proved us wrong.”

That meant everything to me. Not because I need their validation, but because I’d spent years being their silent disappointment and now I’m someone they’re proud of.

I have actual goals now. I want to hit $70k within a year. I want to save up and pay my own rent without help. I want to keep building skills and moving up in my career. I want to be in the best shape of my life. These feel achievable now because I’ve proven to myself I can be consistent.

Most importantly, I’m not wasting my life anymore. Every day I’m building something instead of just existing. That shift from passive existence to active building changed everything.

## The reality, it wasn’t perfect

I fucked up multiple times. There were days I slept until 10am. Days I skipped my workout. Days I wasted 3 hours on YouTube. Days I wanted to quit because changing is hard and being disciplined is exhausting.

But I didn’t let one bad day destroy everything. That was the difference. Before, one slip up meant I was a failure and I’d use it as permission to give back to my old life. This time I just got back on track the next day.

The plan I was using told me specifically that missing days doesn’t reset progress. You just continue from where you are. That mindset kept me from spiraling after bad days like I always had before.

## If your family has given up on you:

Understand that they didn’t give up because they’re cruel, they gave up because they’re exhausted. They’ve tried to help and nothing worked, so they’re protecting themselves from the disappointment of watching you waste your potential.

You can’t fix this with words or promises. They’ve heard those before. You fix it with consistent action over time. Show them through behavior, not explanations.

Find a structured plan that does the thinking for you. You clearly can’t create discipline on your own or you would’ve already. You need external systems that force you to change even when you don’t feel like it.

Start where you actually are, not where you wish you were. If you’re waking up at noon, don’t set a goal to wake up at 5am. Start with 10am and build gradually. Small consistent progress beats massive unsustainable changes.

Remove every distraction and temptation. Delete the apps, block the websites, make wasting time harder than being productive. When scrolling requires effort, you’re way less likely to do it.

Get a better job even if you feel unqualified. Apply to 50, 100 companies. Most will reject you but you only need one yes. That one yes can completely change your financial situation and trajectory.

Build a routine that makes good choices automatic. Don’t rely on daily motivation. Structure your day so discipline is the default.

Accept that you’ll mess up and don’t use it as an excuse to quit. I had multiple bad days. The difference between success and failure is just getting back up.

Most importantly, do it now. Not next week, not next month, today. Because the longer you wait, the more years you waste, and the harder it becomes to change.

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was 25 years old and my entire family had given up on me. I was the disappointment, the burden, the one everyone worried about but nobody knew how to help. I was working a dead end job, living in filth, going nowhere, wasting my life.

My dad told me to my face “we’ve given up on you” and it destroyed me, but it also woke me up.

Now I’m 25 with a real job making actual money, a routine that works, goals I’m actively working toward, and a family that’s proud of me instead of exhausted by me.

Two months. That’s all it took to go from family disappointment to someone they’re proud of.

Two months from now you could have completely reset your relationship with your family and your life. Or you could still be the one everyone’s given up on, just two months older.

Your family can’t do this for you. They’ve tried and it didn’t work. You’re the only one who can unfuck your life.

Start today. Find a system, remove distractions, build structure, get a better job, and prove to them through action that you’re not who they think you are anymore.

Message me if you need help figuring out where to start. I was the family disappointment for years. If I can change, you can too.

Start today.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1766771597.0,TheImprovementRoom,2,0.67,False

We came across many different coffee related products in 2025. Many drippers, grinders, roasters, scales, filters, baskets, etc. Many are awesome products, some were busts. These are the my top 6 favorite products that I enjoyed using the most... in no particular order.

1. Nucleus Link : This sample roaster really elevated my home roasting experience. I get to sample and experience all kinds of beans, even Hacienda Esmeralda Geisha without being scared of messing up.

2. Timemore 078: I am late to the party on this one, but this has become my favorite filter grinder. It replaced the Mazzer Philos on the roster.

3. Subminimal Subscale: we just love the workflow and convenience of the design of this scale.

4. Generic Plastic Filter Paper Presser : This was the best $6 Aliexpress item. It is very helpful in making our filter paper sit in drippers nice and neat. It is well made with some weight.

5. The Better Vessel: We appreciate innovation and experimentation. We are coffee nerds. It is in our nature. This was used in the 2025 World Barista Championship in Milan to get the highest rated espresso. It takes the crema off the espresso. Might not be everyone's cup of tea but it gives another espresso experience. This is just their prototype. I am excited to get their Tritan production version. 

6. Out $25 Coffee Neon Sign from Temu : it makes our coffee corner looks cool and I expected to last a week... but it 6 months in, it is still shining bright.",5,1766771548.0,pourover,3,0.65,False

**Background:** Replacing added sugars with non nutritive sweeteners, such as sucralose, may help reduce weight gain in adults over time. Because sucralose is primarily excreted in the stool, its consumption could lead to changes in the gut microbiome.

**Objectives:** We aimed to explore whether replacing sucrose used in beverages with small quantities of sucralose led to gut microbiome changes among Asian Indian adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) or overweight/obesity (BMI ≥23 kg/m^(2)) without T2D.

**Methods:** In 2 analogous sub studies nested within two 12-wk, open-label parallel-arm randomized controlled trials, adults with T2D (n = 49) or overweight/obesity and no T2D (n = 48) were instructed to replace sucrose in their daily coffee and tea with sucralose or to continue their use of sucrose. We examined changes in gut microbiome community structure and taxonomic composition profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing in stool samples collected before and after the 12-wk interventions. The false discovery rate was controlled using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (q < 0.20).

**Results:** Compared with the control group, the sucralose intervention decreased α diversity (Shannon index: *P* = 0.02; Simpson index: *P* = 0.03) and increased β diversity (*P* = 0.001) in gut microbiome communities of adults with T2D, but not among adults with overweight/obesity (all between-group *P* \> 0.05). Among 185 genera tested in the T2D trial, compared with the control, relative abundances of 14 primarily sugar-fermenting or short-chain fatty-acid-producing *Firmicutes* bacteria in the *Lachnospiracae* family were reduced, whereas *Enterococcus* and *Pediococcus* increased during the intervention (q < 0.20). In contrast, adults with overweight/obesity and no T2D showed no similar changes.

**Conclusions:** Replacing daily sucrose added to coffee and tea with sucralose resulted in changes in gut microbiome community structure and taxonomic composition among Asian Indian adults with T2D, but not those with overweight/obesity and no T2D. Further studies are needed to understand potential health implications and the underlying drivers of these gut microbiome changes.

Hello redditors,

Being dissatisfied with the quality of espresso in local cafes, I started investigation of the espresso theory in the last year. A month ago I bought DeLonghi Dedica and now I'm trying to apply gathered knowledges in the practice.

At the moment I have the following setup:  
DeLonghi Dedica,  
Kingrinder K6  
IMS basket 16-18 grams  
Simple kitchen weights from Amazon

Almost after each brew I see some potholes in the center of the pack (see picture) and also I had a filling, that a coffee flow accelerates to the end of the brewing. But after [recording the brewing video](https://youtu.be/U-_dSz1NZj4) I was able to calculate how much coffee comes out every 5 seconds, when the coffee flowing is started (time from kitchen scales):

\[9s - 13s\] - 9.8 g  
\[14s - 18s\] - 10.4 g  
\[19s - 23s\] - 10.7 g  
\[24s - 28s\] - 9 g

It seems that the flow, according to the math is even, but according to the video perception it is not (maybe because of the flow becoming more chaotic).

In video case I used 17 grams of coffee, and 33 clicks in Kingrinder.

So my question is: is it a channeling in the photo or just a footprint of the bolt in the headgroup?",1,1766770808.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1pwa02z,https://www.reddit.com/r/woocommerce/comments/1pwa02z/how_do_i_calculate_shipping_cost_based_on_cart/,How do I Calculate Shipping Cost Based on Cart?,"Hello,

My wife and I have been selling our roasted coffee in person/on local shelves for about 6 or 7 months now, and we're wanting to start selling online, but obviously there are a lot of considerations when it comes to shipping and logistics ...

My specific question is this: Is there a way to adjust shipping cost automatically depending on what's in the cart? Trying to look for solutions that are free or very low cost.

For example: From what I can see, our cost to ship one 12 oz. bag of coffee is very similar to our cost to ship two 12 oz. bags of coffee. But the cost to ship five is obviously more than two.

From what I saw looking at shipping classes, I could have the shipping cost go up for one product if someone changes the quantity to 5. My concern though is someone will get one of this kind, two of another, so on. 

Ideally, shipping cost would be calculated if someone orders 1-2 12 oz. bags, regardless of the product, it's x cost, and if someone orders 3-4 12 oz. bags, regardless of the product, it's y cost, etc.

So that's what I mean when I say I'd like to have shipping cost calculated based on what's in the cart, and not calculated solely on the shipping class, if possible.

Am I misunderstanding how shipping classes work?

Hope that makes sense. Thanks in advance for any help!",3,1766770668.0,woocommerce,4,1.0,False

1pw9zuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1pw9zuu/how_to_completely_transform_your_life_in_6_months/,How to COMPLETELY Transform Your Life in 6 Months Using DEEP WORK: The Psychology That Actually Works,"okay so I've been obsessively studying this whole ""deep work"" thing for months now. read Cal Newport's book like three times, binged every podcast with productivity experts, even tried those ridiculous 4am morning routines that fitness bros swear by.  
 
here's what nobody tells you: most people are living on autopilot. we're constantly distracted, jumping between tasks, refreshing social media every 5 minutes. our brains have literally been rewired for shallow work. and the scary part? we don't even realize how much potential we're wasting. the average person gets maybe 2 hours of actual focused work done per day. the rest is just... noise. 
 
but here's the thing. this isn't entirely your fault. we live in an attention economy where every app, notification, and platform is literally designed by PhDs in behavioral psychology to keep you hooked. your biology is working against you too, our brains crave that dopamine hit from notifications. it's the same neural pathway as slot machines. but the good news is you can retrain your brain. neuroplasticity is real and it's insanely powerful. 
 
Deep Work by Cal Newport is genuinely the best book on productivity I've ever read. Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who's published like 6 books and dozens of peer reviewed papers, all without working past 5pm or using social media. the book basically argues that the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks is becoming increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. he breaks down exactly why shallow work is killing your potential and gives you the framework to build a deep work practice. this book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity. I'm not exaggerating when I say it completely changed how I approach my work. 
 
the core concept is building what Newport calls ""deep work blocks"". these are periods of 90 to 120 minutes where you work on ONE thing with zero distractions. no phone, no email, no Spotify with lyrics, nothing. just you and the task. sounds simple but it's genuinely hard at first. your brain will literally fight you. you'll feel this intense urge to check your phone or ""quickly google something"". that's your brain seeking easy dopamine. push through it. 
 
start small though. if you've been living in distraction mode for years, trying to do 4 hours of deep work immediately will fail. begin with 25 minute sessions using the Pomodoro technique. there's this app called Forest that's perfect for this. you plant a virtual tree and it grows while you stay focused. if you leave the app, the tree dies. sounds stupid but it actually works because you've got this visual representation of your focus. plus they plant real trees when you hit certain milestones which is pretty cool.  
 
Another app worth checking out is BeFreed, which is an AI-powered learning platform built by Columbia University alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from high-quality sources like research papers, expert interviews, and book summaries to create personalized audio podcasts 

tailored to your goals. You can customize the length from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives and adjust the depth based on your energy level. What makes it useful for deep work is the adaptive learning plan feature, it learns from your interactions and builds a structured roadmap for skill development. Plus you get a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific challenges. The voice customization is actually pretty addictive, there are options like a deep voice similar to Samantha from Her or more energetic tones depending on your mood. Perfect for turning commute time or gym sessions into productive learning without the brain fog from doomscrolling. 
 
gradually increase your sessions to 45 minutes, then 90, then 120. timing matters too. research shows most people's cognitive peak is 2 to 4 hours after waking up. that's when your prefrontal cortex is firing on all cylinders. so your hardest, most important work should happen then. not emails, not meetings, not admin stuff. your most cognitively demanding task. I block out 8am to 11am every single day for deep work and it's genuinely transformed my output. 
 
you also need to eliminate decision fatigue. Barack Obama and Steve Jobs wore the same thing every day for this exact reason. every decision you make depletes your willpower. so automate everything you can. meal prep on sundays. lay out your clothes the night before. have a set morning routine you don't think about. the ""Atomic Habits"" approach by James Clear is killer for this. he talks about habit stacking, where you attach new habits to existing ones. like ""after I pour my morning coffee, I will sit down for deep work"". your brain loves these automatic sequences. 
 
another game changer is the shutdown ritual. this is straight from Newport's book. at the end of your work day, you review what you accomplished, make a plan for tomorrow, and then literally say ""shutdown complete"" out loud. sounds weird but it signals to your brain that work is done. no more checking emails at 9pm or thinking about projects while trying to sleep. your brain needs genuine rest to consolidate learning and maintain focus capacity. 
 
the podcast ""Deep Questions with Cal Newport"" is also insanely good. he does deep dives into listener questions about focus, productivity, and living a deeper life. one episode that stuck with me was about ""attention residue"". basically when you switch tasks, part of your attention stays on the previous thing. so constantly switching between emails, slack, documents means you're never fully present on anything. your cognitive capacity drops by like 40%. that's why batching similar tasks together is so effective. 
 
environmental design is massively underrated too. your space shapes your behavior. if your phone is within arm's reach, you'll check it. guaranteed. so during deep work, put it in another room. use website blockers like Freedom to lock yourself out of social media. tell people you're unavailable during certain hours. create friction for bad habits and remove friction for good ones. 
 
sleep is non negotiable btw. Matthew Walker's book ""Why We Sleep"" breaks down the science and it's honestly terrifying how much sleep deprivation destroys cognitive function. if you're getting less than 7 hours, your deep work capacity is shot. you literally cannot focus properly 


when sleep deprived. your brain needs that time to clear metabolic waste and consolidate memories. prioritize it like your life depends on it, because kinda does. 
 
here's the brutal truth though. nobody is coming to save you. you can read every productivity book, listen to every podcast, buy every app. but none of it matters if you don't actually do the work. and the work is uncomfortable. sitting with difficulty without reaching for distraction feels physically painful at first. your brain will scream at you. but that discomfort is literally your brain rewiring itself. you're building new neural pathways. it gets easier but only if you're consistent. 
 
one last thing. track your deep work hours. get a simple habit tracker or use the Streaks app. seeing your progress visually is incredibly motivating. aim for 20 hours of deep work per week to start. that might sound like a lot but it's less than 3 hours per day. and honestly, 20 hours of focused deep work will produce more results than 60 hours of distracted shallow work. quality over quantity always. 
 
the transformation isn't overnight. but in 6 months of consistent deep work practice, you'll genuinely be unrecognizable. your output will skyrocket. your skills will compound. opportunities will start appearing because you're producing work that actually stands out. most people won't do this because it requires genuine effort and discomfort. which is exactly why it works so well for those who commit.

Winter does this thing                                             where time slows down just enough                           for people to notice each other again.

Winter does this thing to people.                          Coffee tastes more deliberate.                                Hands stay in pockets longer,                                      not because of the cold,                                              but because suddenly touch feels                              like it should mean something.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

Affection doesn’t knock loudly this season.                   It leans in.It says,                                                        “Stay a little longer.”                                                         It pours another cup.It waits.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

If winter is asking me to stay, I won’t argue specially if the empty chair across the table turns out to be yours….",3,1766770443.0,LettersAnswered,1,1.0,False

1pw9uov,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw9uov,Everything I ate in NYC in 5 days from Canada,"I know, I know, how did I eat so much in 5 days. I couldn’t even fit half the pictures on here. I just love NYC and did tons of research to try and make the most of my trip. It basically revolved around me and my gf eating the whole time. I have been to NYC once before but it was my first time going as an adult. I’ll leave a review for each one and some more reviews at the end for stuff I tried that’s not pictured. Thanks for having me NYC!

Kati Roll - First time I went to NYC I had Kati Roll and could not stop thinking about it. First place I went to once I landed but it wasn’t as good as I remember and a little pricey. 7/10

Cellos Pizza - This is basically what I came for. To try all the pizza places although I quickly realized it wasn’t gonna be possible unless I ate pizza the whole time haha. This actually ended up being my favourite spot. I got 2 vodka slices as that’s all they had left but the crust was crispy but still airy and the cheese and sauce had good flavour. I unfortunately didn’t hit most of the classic spots like Joe’s or Scare’s but I thought this was pretty good. 8.5/10

Pull Tab - Amazing, just look at it. 10/10

Tziki - Wanted something fresh to start the day off and found this place randomly. It was good enough. Nothing special and I’m sure you could find better if you looked. 7/10

Fellini - Went just for this tiramisu latte. Really good and did not disappoint. 9/10

Los Tacos - Getting tacos like this especially where I’m from in Canada (Saskatchewan) is impossible. I’ve been to San Fran and I would say this was better than anything I tried in San Fran. Sauces were amazing, meat was amazing. My type of food. 9.5/10

Patent Pending - Wow. I’m a bartender so I feel like I can judge drinks pretty well. I’ve almost never had a cocktail where I didn’t think it needed some sort of adjustment for overall balance until I came here. It was a pretty well hidden speakeasy. These were the best cocktails I’ve ever had. Perfectly balanced and I couldn’t even think of one thing that could be adjusted to make it better. 10/10

Sharifs Famous - Just needed some shawarma after having a few drinks and saw this place with 5 stars on my way home. Owner was super nice and it hit the spot. 8/10

Magnolia Bakery - I didn’t even think I liked banana pudding but I had also never tried it. I didn’t think much of it at the time but I can still imagine what it tasted like. I think I liked it more than I realized. 7.5/10

L’industrie - I was sooo excited to try this place because a pepperoni slice with ricotta and honey and a salami topped pizza is my ideal slice. Even though I watched them make it, it tasted a little stale to me. Next time I would try a full pie. It was still pretty good and better than anything you can get where I’m from. The fig jam and bacon was honestly the better slice. It wasn’t as flavourful and as fresh as cellos so I’d have to go one step lower on the rating. 8/10

Chada NYC - Holy shit. Top 5 foods i have ever tried. I don’t even remember what was in those dumplings but they sat on a coconut milk broth. One of the best things i have ever ate. And the Khao Soy was so rich and indulgent. I loved every part of that meal. They also had coconut Thai tea that was lovely. 10/10 best thing I ate on the trip

Taqueria El Chato - Found this place on the way home really late one night. It was honestly really good. Tacos weren’t as good as Los Tacos but whatever I had on the right was really good. Sorry, can’t remember what they are called. 8/10

NYC Dosa Cart - I’ve wanted to go here since seeing him on YouTube. I grew up eating this and it was just nice to support him. I also got to chat to him and he even spoke my language a bit. It was pretty good and I can see why he is so loved in that area. Although id have to say my mom does it better hahaha. I wish I could’ve added more photos because I got a really nice photo of him on film. 7.5/10

Red Gate Bakery - We went for chocolate chip cookie but it was late in the day and they had sold out. Apparently some news article came out a few days prior saying they had the best one in NYC lol! So they were selling out super fast. We got this brownie instead and fuck it was so good. Best brownie I’ve had. We tried going back earlier the next day for a cookie but the line was around the block so we didn’t even try. But the brownie gets 10/10. I imagine the cookie is just as good. 

Lucia Pizza - I’m pretty sure this was Lucia. Someone correct me if I’m wrong. Solid slice, the spinach slice was pretty good and the ground beef shibang was good. Happy to eat it. 8/10

Mary O’s - When a place only sells one thing and has 5 stars on Google you already know it’s gonna be good. It’s just really really good. Just go try it please. Homemade soda bread with homemade jam and butter. So so so good. 11/10

Unknown - Mnagk mochi from some place in China Town. I don’t remember which one. It was pretty good and fresh. My gf really liked it. 8/10

787 Coffee - This was a random find but it was super good. I love coffee like this. Strong but milky and sweet but not too sweet. Would recommend. 9/10

Mama’s too - I was excited to try this but a little disappointed. The square slice was just too pointy if you know what I mean. It kind of hurt to bite into and I absolutely hate that. If I’m gonna get a square slice like yes I want the edges to be kinda crispy but I’m getting a square slice hoping it’s super doughy and airy kind of like focaccia. It wasn’t. The vodka sandwich was pretty good. Really messy and again the bread was a little too pokey for me. My gf liked it better than I did. 6.5/10

Other things I tried

Levain bakery - Not my type of cookie. It was too big and hard and not really soft at all. Also too sweet. The ice cream from Panna was really good and I think that saved it. 4/10

Caffe Panna - Really good although it didn’t look anything like the photos haha. 8/10

Waffles and Dinges - I remember this being soooo good when I first went to NYC but I got it this time and it tasted kind of old. Was t very good. 4/10 

Hungry Llama - Got a honey whipped late from here. Pretty good. Too thick and creamy for me but my gf enjoyed. 7/10

I probably ate more than this and can’t remember or don’t have photos to remind me. Anyways hope you guys enjoyed the review and if you made it all the way to the end. Congrats hahaha",70,1766770307.0,FoodNYC,11,0.98,False
1pw9unv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pw9unv/my_26m_bf_didnt_call_me_f26_on_christmas_day/,my 26M bf didn’t call me F26 on christmas day,"TLDR: i told my boyfriend a month ago that id be having a lonely christmas and asked if we could do something together. he was non committal but said probably. I asked on Christmas Eve and he said he’d be busy but could call me on Christmas Day. He didn’t. I feel upset by him

Long story:

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over a year (would be two years in march), we don’t live together, we both live with parents - he in the city, me 25mins from the city. 

Usually for Christmas, it’s me, my parents and sister, and every second year my older sister, brother-in-law and nephew come. This year they were going to my brother-in-law’s family’s house. My sister who also lives at home got a new job and was working on Christmas Eve, Day, and Boxing Day, so it was only going to be me and my parents. 

I knew this would feel lonely - we dont really have warm fuzzy christmases, my dad is an annoying person, what makes it fun is having my sister there. Because she was working we couldn’t do any of our usual things - we go and buy pastries for christmas day breakfast on Christmas Eve, last-minute shop and wrap presents, in the evening she goes to see her bf and I used to go see my ex. On Christmas Day we go for a walk then watch whatever cringe christmas films Netflix has brought out that year. 

So a month ago when I learned that my sister would be working, i asked my boyfriend if he would go for a walk with me on Christmas Day. I said I could drive to him and we could walk around the nearby park. He said probably but that he’d have to check what his family were doing, and when he said probably his tone and demeanour just seemed to be saying no. I found this hurtful because I honestly didn’t think it would be a big ask to spare an hour of your day to go a walk with someone you’re meant to love so that they don’t feel lonely on a day that’s meant to be about togetherness etc. 

He spends Christmas with his family - his parents, grandparents and sister. His grandparents live a few hours away and stay at his home for three weeks over the festive period. His sister is currently away travelling so wasn’t spending Christmas with them. On Christmas Eve, he goes to his other grandparents’ home in the evening to have a big christmas meal with all his cousins etc. On Christmas Day, he, his parents, usually sister, and grandparents all have breakfast together, open presents, go for a walk, have dinner in the afternoon and watch christmas tv together. 

For Christmas Eve, I asked if we could go out in the morning for coffee and/or a nice walk. He said yes, and stayed over after coming late on Tuesday evening. We opened presents in the morning, and then he said he no longer had time to go out because he had to buy gifts for his cousins before going to his grandparents’ in the evening. I felt hurt because I wanted to go out together, it was sunny, and he had told me several times that yes we could go out in the morning. 

I asked if we could go a walk on Christmas Day like I had suggested before and he said no, that he would be busy with his family. I said don’t you care that it will be lonely for me, it would only be an hour and he’d have the whole day with them. He still said no and he said he could call on Christmas Day instead. 

Christmas Day came and he texted but never called. I feel hurt by this. I don’t understand why he makes out as though his plans are so rigid - he always acts very precious about his family plans, but his sister is on the other side of the planet for the holiday season so it can’t be as mandatory as he puts across, plus in other years she generally only stays for Christmas Eve to Boxing Day then goes back to where she lives two hours away. 

I understand that it can be difficult to deviate from set plans, but I also think he is grown and could do what he wants, so to me it just seems like he doesn’t care enough to want to, and it seems childish to me. I understand that perhaps seeing your grandparents is important, however they are in very good health and also are here for a number of weeks plus he sees them throughout the year - they also stay a couple of weeks in spring and summer. 

I understand that I can do things myself so should be less bothered by my sister and boyfriend’s lack of availability, but it is hurtful when someone has previously agreed to something to then change their mind (like Christmas Eve coffees/walk, calling on Christmas day), and when I have voiced that I will feel lonely on christmas. I also understand that I knew my sister would be working, that I would be relatively alone on Christmas Day, and have spent the last month telling myself it’s just Thursday, it’s just another day, and that it’s fine to be on my own on a random Thursday. 

I just feel like if my partner was feeling sad that they’d be lonely on a particular day, that I would do my best to be there for them or to make them feel loved, but his texts were sporadic (I understand having family time and living in the moment etc) and I just don’t understand how it would be so impossible / implausible to spare some time to go out or to make a phone call. 

I also feel like when you get older and get a partner, you should be making an effort to make some holiday traditions of your own, whether that’s seeing each other for at least part of Christmas Eve/day/Boxing Day. 

I understand family ‘traditions’ and family time being important to you so perhaps not being available, but I feel like this viewpoint is too understanding and generous, because my feelings are hurt and /surely/ you would have some free time. I am annoyed, but do I just need to get over it?

He said he could call later today (Boxing Day), but I just feel sad because he didn’t yesterday. 

Additionally, a few weeks ago at his house, his mum said I could go and join them (his parents and two sets of grandparents) for a Boxing Day lunch. He didn’t mention it to me again, so I asked him on wed if this was still happening and he said I shouldn’t go because they’d be having seafood, which I don’t eat. This is an instance where I understand I probably wouldn’t enjoy it (would feel awkward due to my meal preferences/needing adaptations/whatever), but I find it kind of hurtful that he wasn’t giving me a choice/didn’t mention it again to me and I had to ask/he couldn’t have provided an alternate option for me. 

I just feel sad, and I know he’ll act like I’m being annoying if I mention it. Is there a way to convey how hurtful it is without sounding accusatory",3,1766770306.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

He has two autistic teenager (adult now) so they agreed to bird-nesting taking turns supervising the kids. He gave her a house and lump sum for the divorce and promised to helped her get on her feet for 5 years plus all education paid for (she doesn’t work). After 5 years and her crying he continue to support her. My bf is a pilot and his ex had a fiancée then so when he flies she stays and when he’s home she leaves. Bf doesn’t want to commute from his base but agreed to end this living situation when he retires. He said he will put a for sale sign up the day he retires. It never happened. His ex has multiple serious relationships and always threatens to leave. Fast forward to 2020. I am losing my job because of the pandemic and since he will be retiring in a year he asked me to retire so we can be together. I did. I was shocked when I arrived at his home that the ex has moved in. He said she has yet another break up and has nowhere to go. It would be safer for the boys during the Pandemic shut down. He said it would be temporary. Since then she settled in and never left. She pretended to be my best friend at first. Buying me presents and inviting me out for coffee. I tried to be courteous without letting her too close as she tries to get me to talk about my bf and would ‘unintentionally’ tell me his secrets. Once she talk about her delivery with him in the car like I wasn’t there. I tried to be part of the family by babysitting the kids when he was flying and she was on vacation with her new boyfriend. But after a while I learn to keep a distance when she blamed me for her son’s behavior and reprimanded me for giving them one small treat. To avoid conflict I start to keep my respectful distance. It’s been almost 5 years now. Instead of buying them a house as promised (she sold hers) and starting a new life with me, we are still in limbo. I kept myself to his room 90% of the time since she lord about in his house. She would walk in and out of our room like it’s her own and only moved her clothes out of our closet a year ago after I put a camera in suspecting somebody’s been rummaging my stuff. My laptop’s power port was fried twice since I took the camera out and Apple’s staff was puzzled since it’s has been damaged by liquid. Sugary liquid! Today our room still kept HER leopard print African motif decoration like she would be moving back in any day. I have been expressing my unhappiness for two years now. But nothing changed. He said she is here because of the boys. That I want to throw his boys out and until I see this family dissolved I wouldn’t be happy. Bf was diagnosed with two kinds of cancer this May and had four surgeries. Luckily all benign. I was with him all the way. But since then I noticed their relationship doesn’t seem like what he told me (no interaction other than concerning the boys). She hugged him tenderly before he goes off to surgery. He went to a massage she bought him without telling me. When caught he said it is lie by omission which is not a lie. They plan family movie dates together. Not to mention he has been buying her flowers on birthdays, Mother’s Day etc as long as we’ve been together. I told him I couldn’t do it any longer. We either get married or he sell the house. Now he thinks I’m threatening him and told her everything. I feel that they are plotting against me. She doesn’t have a man now and wants to keep him. She is doing everything in her power to get rid of me. I love him. And because of that I’ve been enduring all these without telling a soul. Now he said it’s a lot of money to buy them a house and find a place for us to live. But all I know is she doesn’t want to move and he is not going to make her. Maybe I’m not worth the money to be spent? Should I leave? I am exhausted and feeling hopeless. And I’m not even family.",0,1766770203.0,AITAH,11,0.44,False

1pw9q6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1pw9q6k/the_keene_lattice/,The Keene Lattice,"Maggie didn’t notice the time until the building went quiet.

The campus physics lab had emptied hours ago, leaving her alone with the hum of the chilled water loop and the faint tick of cooling metal heat sinks. The containment rig sat in the center of the test bay, a ribbed steel frame wrapped with coils and sensor nodes, cables spilling out across the concrete floor.

“Last one,” she muttered, rubbing at the crust in her eyes as she keyed in the sequence.

Field geometry model, stable. Power draw, at the upper limit but within tolerance. Error margins flickered amber, then settled green. On the monitor, her equations stacked over the CAD model of the device.

She armed the test. The relay bank clacked in the control cabinet as capacitors came online.

“Come on,” she said. “Just give me thirty seconds.”

The countdown hit zero. The rig shivered as current slammed into the coils. Air pressure in the room shifted. The fluorescent tubes above buzzed louder, light warping at the edges of her vision.

Lines bent subtly inward, as if the room were trying to fold around an invisible point. A pen she’d left on the cart near the frame rolled uphill.

Then the breaker tripped.

The world snapped back into place as every light in the lab went out. The hum died, leaving a sharp, ringing silence. Somewhere in the building, a transformer let out a muffled thud.

“Shit.”

Emergency strips along the floor flicked to life, bathing everything in dim amber. Maggie sat there a moment, hands still resting on the key pads heart racing. She pushed back from the console, the chair’s wheels squeaking in the quiet.

On the tablet beside the monitor, the last readings froze mid‑spike. The power draw had leapt far beyond projected values in the final fraction of a second.

The final result of her experiment was a building‑wide power outage and a more than likely irate facilities manager in the morning. She shut down what she could manually, checking the rig for heat or damage, then grabbed her bag.

By the time she stumbled back to her cramped office, the clock on her monitor read 4:17 a.m.

She curled up on the dusty old couch beneath the whiteboard, still dense with integrals and diagrams, set her phone alarm for two hours, and drifted off

The alarm buzzed against her skull. Maggie sat up too fast and the room tilted, her eyes gummy, her neck screaming in protest from being smashed against the arm of the couch. Yesterday’s clothes were wrinkled and smelled faintly of coolant.

She splashed water on her face in the bathroom down the hall, then followed habit more than thought down to the ground floor café, guided by the scent of burned coffee and baked sugar.

The line was mercifully short. She tugged her hair into a loose knot, blinking at the chalkboard menu without taking any of it in.

“Rough night?”

The voice came from just behind her. Maggie looked back. The man behind her, one hand stuffed in the pocket of his work jacket, the other wrapped around a to‑go cup. He had a few days’ worth of stubble softening a strong jaw, dark circles under his eyes that mirrored her own, and a maintenance badge clipped to his chest: BEN HART, FACILITIES.

“Power techs love you physicist grad students.” he added. “Keeps us employed.”

Maggie winced. “That bad?”

“Campus grid logged a spike big enough to trip half the building,” Ben said. “Security report says ‘possible equipment malfunction in sublevel lab three.’”

“That’s… oddly specific.”

He shrugged. “They write it like that when they don’t want to blame anyone.”

She huffed a laugh despite herself. “I prefer ‘historic breakthrough’ on the form, personally.”

“You the historic breakthrough?”

“I was trying to be.” She shifted the strap of her bag. “Containment fields.”

“Like force fields?” Ben said. “Or like lasers and things?”

“No.” Maggie said. ""More like the stabilization of gravitational rifts. I have a theory that if you can essentially capture a black hole it can be studied closer. If I could just get the electricity in this facility to behave on my behalf I might stand a chance at completing my experiment in conjunction with a particle collider one day.”

He caught the flicker of irritation in her voice, not at him but seemingly at her work. He didn’t press, just nodded toward the counter.

“Tell you what, Dr. Historic Breakthrough, I’ll buy your coffee as an apology on behalf of the power grid.”

“You don’t have to.”

“I kind of do,” he said. “The guy who runs the breaker room was swearing about ‘those damn science projects’ at five a.m. There may have also been some name calling. Buying coffee for the culprit feels like balancing karma.”

""Name calling? Like what kind of name calling.""

""The kind that would upset my mother if I repeated it.""

The barista glanced up, waiting. Maggie sighed.

“Fine. Large black coffee and a dozen donut holes.”

The next few weeks blurred into a rhythm: days split between the lab and her office; nights that stretched a little too long; text messages from Ben that lured her out of the building with promises of real food.

He’d swing by the lab at odd hours under the pretense of checking the breaker panel. Sometimes he actually did. Other times he leaned in the doorway, watching her coax the new, reinforced rig through its startup sequence.

“Explain it to me like I’m an idiot,” he said once, arms folded, gaze on the coils.

“You’re not an idiot.” Maggie replied

“Flattery noted. I still don’t know what I’m looking at.”

She tapped a schematic on the screen. “Think of it as a net. You throw it over a region of space so that certain things, fields, forces, particles have to behave inside it. They can’t propagate the way they want to. It’s not a wall. More like… rules that only apply in there.”

“And last time, the rules blew a fuse.”

“Last time, I underestimated how much juice the rules needed.” she said. “I fixed it.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You sure?”

“No,” she admitted, and he smiled.

Later that night they grabbed beers at the dive bar four blocks from campus. He told stories about growing up in a town where the tallest building was the grain silo. She talked about the first time she saw a pair of iron filings dance inside a prototype field, how it felt like watching gravity forget itself.

On one of those nights, he walked her home through a slow drizzle, hands shoved deep in his pockets, shoulders hunched.

“So,” he said. “You gonna blow the lights again tonight?”

“I upgraded the power regulation,” she replied. “In theory, no but I know who to call if I do.”

“In theory.” He smirked.

The email came on a Thursday afternoon.

DR. MAGGIE KEENE – FUNDING OPPORTUNITY / COLLABORATION REQUEST.

The sender’s address resolved to a research foundation she’d never heard of, with a website full of stock photos and vague mission statements about “advanced energy solutions” and “environmental containment technologies.” The message itself was flattering without being specific, full of references to her thesis work and recent preprint.

At the bottom, a note: A representative will be in touch and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your work in person.

She almost deleted it. She knew what it was like to deal with corporations. Then she looked at her current budget spreadsheet, at the highlighted red cells under EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT, and sighed.

The liaison showed up precisely at 10 a.m. the following Tuesday: mid‑forties, well‑cut suit, an institutional smile that never quite reached his eyes.

“Call me Harris,” he said, shaking her hand. “Your paper on localized field stability made the rounds in our organization. We’re very interested in what you’re doing here.”

“Your organization is…?”

“A private consortium,” he said easily. “We support research that has direct practical applications. Containment, particularly, is a field of… growing interest.”

He walked the perimeter of the rig, hands clasped behind his back, gaze lingering on the coils, the reinforced breaker panels, the new grounding straps.

“You’ve achieved impressive results on a minimal budget,” Harris said. “But this kind of work shouldn’t be constrained by institutional politics and grant cycles. Imagine what you could do with a dedicated lab. Clean power. Custom hardware. A team.”

“And the strings?” Maggie asked.

He turned suddenly toward her. His face changed, but remained the same. As if he had dropped a vail. There was a change in his voice too. It seemed sharper. More to a point.

“I knew you were a smart girl Maggie."" He replied. ""You see, some of my colleagues said this meeting was pointless. That a poor grad student such as yourself would beg for funding, but I said 'No, Maggie's a smart girl'. You asked about strings so here it is, ours are simple, you pursue your research. With any success we get first access to your designs. You of course still maintain all credit and can do what you will with your creation... after we get a look at it first.”

“And if I say no?”

“Then you keep fighting with university procurement for another year,” he said. “By then, someone else may have solved the same problems you’re facing. Less elegantly, of course.”

He met her eyes, and something flickered there: not threat, exactly, but a sense of inevitability.

“We’re offering you time and tools, Miss Keene,” he said. “What you do with them is up to you.”

Two years later, the rig she’d built with their money hummed like a living thing.

It no longer resembled the cobbled‑together frame in the campus basement. This one sat in a private facility an hour outside the city, where the walls were thick, the air always a little too clean, and security badges changed colors every three months.

They called it a containment lattice in internal memos, which made her want to crawl out of her skin. Just another thing that aggravated her about working there. If she was the one working the long hours and putting in all the hard work it was only fair that she get to name the device, but since she hadn’t, containment lattice it was.

She'd found a way to shape the field so it wrapped around irregular boundaries without collapsing, hugging surfaces no geometry textbook knew about. She’d watched test objects disappear inside and reappear unchanged, watched sensors report values that shouldn’t have been possible. Every new demo, a knock out of the park.

Harris approached her after one of these demos which just so happened to be in front of the board of executives.

""My my, you've come a long way Maggie."" He said. ""I have a request for you.""

""Oh yeah, what's that?"" She replied, her nervous system always lit up around Harris. Always on edge when he was nearby.

""What would you think about designing a Lite version of your containment lattice?"" Harris went on. ""We were thinking of something small and portable. Potentially for firefighter or maybe environmental use.""

“You’re not an environmental agency,” Maggie said.

“We contract with people who are,” he replied. “Your device can protect communities from dangerous conditions. That’s a good thing, isn’t it?”

Her skepticism showed on her face and in the quiet spaces of her mind when some of the data from “off‑site demonstrations” came back heavily redacted.

Still, she agreed.

 About a year later she had a refined and portable unit. She brought in Harris for a demonstration. As her team ran things in the lab she was in the observation deck with Harris.

""By trimming power requirements, and integrating a collapsible frame we've managed to get pretty close to what you were asking for."" Maggie explained.

The demo went off without a hitch: a simulated spillover from the particle collider, the lattice deployed, contaminants held in a shimmering, barely visible shell. A literal pocket held device now capable of containing a black hole.

Her team applauded. Harris shook her hand.

“Congratulations Miss Keene. You’ve done it again. I was thinking since we are fast accelerating out of the prototype range, have you thought of a name for your device yet?” He asked.

“The Keene Lattice.” Maggie replied.

On the drive back into the city, traffic thick with late‑day commuters, her phone sat heavy in her pocket. She kept touching it, checking the time, feeling a tight sensation building in her chest.

She let herself into the apartment she now shared with Ben just as the orange of late evening sky slanted through the blinds. He stood in the tiny kitchen, sleeves rolled up, chopping vegetables with more enthusiasm than skill. A pan hissed on the stove.

“You’re early,” he said, glancing up. “Did the universe tear itself in half and they let you go home on time for once?”

“Funny,” she said.

She crossed the room and kissed him with a heavy enthusiasm.

“Wow,” he said. “Either the demo went really well or you did tear a hole in space.”

“It went well.”

“Then why do you look like that?”

“Because,” she said, pulling back to pull a blue stick out of her purse. She put it on the counter beside him. “I’m pregnant.”

He stared at her.

The knife clattered onto the cutting board. For a second, the only sound was the pan on the stove.

Then his face broke open into a grin she’d never seen on him before, wide and bright and utterly unguarded.

“Are you serious?” he asked.

She nodded, sudden tears burning at the corners of her eyes. He grabbed her and lifted her off the ground, spinning her once in the cramped kitchen, laughing into her shoulder.

They talked that night until the food went cold: about names and rooms and what they’d tell their families about it, cribs and how they’d manage her insane hours.

At some point, the conversation drifted, like it always did, to the news murmuring from the muted TV in the corner.

“Did you see that thing about the Canadian town?” Ben asked, gesturing at the scrolling headlines. “Coldwater, I think? The whole place was evacuated. Underground gas leak or something.”

She glanced over. The banner read: COASTAL COMMUNITY CLEARED AFTER “SUBSURFACE EVENT.”

“That’s not exactly how gas leaks are usually worded,” she said.

Maggie’s phone buzzed on the table.

She picked it up, saw it was a message and the sender made stomach tighten.

HARRIS – SECURE.

Ben watched her expression shift. “Work?”

“Yeah.” Her voice came out thinner than she wanted. She thumbed the text  icons.

“It’s Keene, go ahead.”

“We need you back in,” he said. “There’s a deployment scheduled, and the field teams require instruction on the portable lattice. This one is time‑sensitive.”

He did not say where.

Maggie looked at Ben. He was already reaching to turn the stove off, the question in his eyes familiar: How bad? How long?

“I just got home,” she typed into the phone. “Can’t someone else—?”

Before she could finish her message Harris texted again.

“We need you now, I’ll explain more when you arrive.” Harris said. “We’ll have a car at your building in 10 minutes.”

Maggie stared at the screen for a moment.

Ben leaned his hip against the counter, studying her.

“I’ll pack you some food dear.”

She managed a small, strained smile. “I love you Ben.”

The car arrived outside just when it was supposed to. Maggie got in. Saw a brawny man in a suit in the driver seat.

“So where are we going?” Maggie asked.

“Classified, ma’am,” He replied. “I’m to drop you off at the executive helipad from there you’ll be with Harris.”

She sat in silence for the entirety of the car ride. Except when she would gasp at sudden movements the driver was making to get through traffic. The possibilities of what was so important and why it had to ruin her news with Ben. It only made sense it had to do with that gas leak in Nova Scotia. It was the perfect opportunity for another “offsite demonstration”. Maybe this time they wanted to take her with them. Maybe she’d finally get to see what her work was being used for.

When they arrived at the executive helipad Maggie wasn’t met with Harris, just another brawny man, this one bearded and tattooed  just about every visible place she could see.

“Where’s Harris?” Maggie asked.

“Waiting at the Hangar,” He replied. “He’ll explain more when we get there. It’s about a 20 minute flight from here.”

Maggie made her way to the idling helicopter hair blowing all around. 

The tall brawny man walking beside her bent her down so that she wasn’t standing straight up walking into the blades. When they got inside the man buckled her in, then himself. .

He handed her a head set and keyed in on his as the helicopter took off.

“Is this your first time flying?” He asked.

“How could you tell?” She replied without hitting the push-to-talk.

He mimed hitting the button to her so she knew what to do.

She keyed in this time.

“How could you tell?”

“Lucky guess.” He responded

“So what’s this about?” Asked

“Harris hasn’t told you yet?” He responded. “You’re gonna be teaching a monkey how to use that new device of yours to help with that gas leak in Canada.” 

“I’m sorry, did you say a monkey?” She replied frantically.

“Yep,” he said. “And I'm the monkey. Names Christopher Hale nice to meet you Dr. Keene.” 

He extended his hand out to shake hers.",1,1766769998.0,shortstory,0,0.99,False

Looking for people who wouldn't mind a bit of casual co-op every one and then, new to PC gaming and a bit anxious but i'm open to using discord, chatting and just chilling.

(I play on other platforms too.)

I'm into survival games and shooters mostly, but open to basically anything. At the moment I've been playing PEAK, Ready or Not, State of Decay 2 and Schedule I as I've been a bit reluctant to go crazy buying games just to play on my own so i'm open to suggestions.

A little about me, I'm a barista so I'm big on coffee. I've been skateboarding on and off for the last 10 years but I absolutely love that too. Other than that you'll find me at home gaming or trying to keep plants alive.

Been a bit introverted as of late but here I am trying to do something about it!

I game more often than not so I'll likely be active most days if anyone is ever down, feel free to DM for steam code.

Winter does this thing to people.                          Coffee tastes more deliberate.                                Hands stay in pockets longer,                                      not because of the cold,                                              but because suddenly touch feels                              like it should mean something.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

Affection doesn’t knock loudly this season.                   It leans in.It says,                                                        “Stay a little longer.”                                                         It pours another cup.It waits.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

...except it takes place in an office building and all the items/enemies are common things you would see in an everyday setting. 

enemies take on the form of ""corporate zombies"", mindless workers who have all the fun sucked out of them and now must work for the company at the cost of their lives. 

items are things like coffee and vending machine sodas that boost your stats such as movement speed, attack damage, attack speed, etc.

weapons are office supplies. you start the game with a basic pen but will find various weapons throughout the map like staplers which are ranged weapons that fire staples at enemies. stronger variants of the pen weapon such as a pencil or marker. 

there are also TIES. ties can be unlocked and equipped at the menu before starting a run. different ties grant different stats/abilities and some ties may also have a gimmick. the basic red tie is the default tie that has no bonuses. later, you can gain a chicken tie that lowers your max HP but gives you bonus running speed when running from enemies. a turtle tie that grants you increased maximum HP and armor/defense at the cost of lowering your movement speed, a death tie that lets you insta-kill enemies but lowers your max HP to 1 so you die in 1 hit. plus, plenty more ties with other gimmicks!

throughout the game, there are various civillians you can save. when you save their lives, they will reward you with ""thank yous"". hence, the title of the game.

you can spend ""thank yous"" in the main menu after you die to grant permanent upgrades that will make you stronger in future runs.

(Part 2),"The walk into the building felt longer than usual. My badge scanned at the door with the same dull beep it always made, but my pulse spiked like it was doing something new.



At my desk, I set my bag down and logged in with fingers I hoped no one noticed were shaking. The email icon blinked in the corner of the screen. Unread. I clicked it. The subject line expanded across the top of the screen.



**Opportunity for Discussion: Internal Systems and Continuity**



My stomach dropped. I scanned the sender information first, like that might make it safer. It was an internal address. Formal. No name I recognized personally. Just a title. I opened it.



**From: Internal Systems and Continuity**

**To: Nicole Bennett**

**Subject: Opportunity for Discussion**



*Nicole,*

*Based on observed performance and recent internal needs, we would like to invite you to a brief discussion regarding a potential role expansion within Internal Systems and Continuity. This is not a formal offer at this time. The purpose of the conversation would be to discuss your current responsibilities, interests, and availability, and to determine whether further steps would be appropriate. If you are open to this conversation, please reply at your convenience to coordinate a time this week.*



*Best regards,*



*Internal Systems and Continuity*



*Organizational Development*



I read it once. Then again. It didn’t mention an application. It didn’t reference anything I had sent. It didn’t say why me. Just that they had noticed. My heart hammered against my ribs as I scrolled back up, half expecting another paragraph to appear. Something accusatory. Something explaining itself. Nothing did. It was reasonable. Careful. Neutral. Which somehow made it worse.





I leaned back in my chair and stared at the screen, my reflection faintly visible in the dark glass between lines of text. Observed performance. I minimized the email and sat there for a second, grounding myself. Breathing. Counting. Then I stood up.



Riley’s desk was two rows over. She looked up as soon as she saw me coming, eyes flicking instinctively to my face. “Well?” she asked. I lowered my voice. “Can I show you something?” She rolled her chair back and patted the space beside her. I pulled the email up again and angled the screen toward her. She read it slowly. Carefully. When she looked back up at me, she was smiling. “You didn’t imagine it,” she said. “I didn’t apply,” I whispered. “I know,” she said. “That’s the point.” I swallowed. “I didn’t even send anything.” Riley leaned back in her chair, studying me the way she did when she was choosing her words on purpose. “Nicole,” she said, “you don’t have to send something for people to notice you.”



That landed harder than I expected.



Across the room, keyboards clicked. Phones rang. Someone laughed at something unrelated. The office kept moving. But for the first time, it felt like it was moving around me instead of past me.



I went back to my desk and tried to work. That was the plan, at least. I opened the same programs I always did. Answered the same types of emails. Moved through the routine that usually carried me through the morning without much effort. My hands knew what to do even when my attention did not. Every few minutes, my eyes drifted back to the email. It sat open in the background, minimized but not gone. I brought it back up once. Then again. The wording didn’t change. It stayed careful. Neutral. Almost considerate. I tried to remember specific moments that might have stood out. Conversations I had handled. Problems I had stepped into quietly. None of it felt dramatic enough to explain why someone had taken the time to notice.



Mid morning, during a meeting that usually faded into background noise, someone asked a question and the room stalled. I answered without thinking. The response came out clean, already formed. A few heads nodded. Someone typed something into their notes. My stomach tightened. Not with pride, but with awareness. Had I always done that?



Back at my desk, I opened a reply. The cursor blinked at me, patient in a way that felt personal. I typed slowly.



*“Thank you for reaching out. I would be open to discussing the opportunity and learning more about the role.”*



I paused.



It sounded too eager. I deleted the last sentence and tried again.



*“I would be open to a brief conversation to better understand the scope of the role and next steps.”*



Better. Safer.



I added my availability. Kept it short. Professional. Unassuming. I reread it three times, searching for something I had accidentally revealed. Confidence. Ambition. Need. It looked like a normal reply. That didn’t make my hands shake any less. I hovered over the send button longer than I meant to, long enough to think about Sunday night. About the draft I had deleted. About unbookmarking the posting and telling myself there was still time. This felt like time catching up. I inhaled, held it for a count of three, and clicked send.



Nothing happened.



No confirmation. No fanfare.



The message disappeared into my sent folder like it had always belonged there. For a moment, I just stared at the screen. Then I minimized the window and forced myself back into my work.



At lunch, I beside Riley at the table like usual. We were all talking about nothing important, Riley was going on about something she’d watched the night before. A mutual annoyance between Caleb and Julian about the vending machines. Plans that didn’t really exist yet. I almost forgot. Almost.



Halfway through complaining about a printer that never worked, Paige said, “Oh. Apparently I am meeting with someone from Organizational Development later.” She said it like it was nothing. Like she hadn’t been thinking about it all morning. “They said they want to pick my brain about continuity stuff,” she added, shrugging. “Whatever that means. Julian nodded once and had a hint of confusion on his face. Caleb raised an eyebrow, glanced at me, then went back to his food. Riley did not react at all. I felt something settle in my chest.



The rest of the afternoon passed quietly. Work got done. Conversations stayed surface level. The email stayed sent. By the time the day wound down, I had convinced myself I hadn’t done anything reckless. I shut down my computer, gathered my things, and stood up with everyone else. As I left, I checked my sent folder one last time. The message was still there.



Delivered.



Waiting.





That night, my apartment felt smaller than usual. Not claustrophobic. Just close, like the walls had leaned in a little while I was gone. I kicked off my shoes by the door and stood there longer than necessary, listening to the hum of the refrigerator and the distant sound of traffic outside. I didn’t turn on the TV. I set my bag down, poured a glass of water I forgot to drink, and sat at the small table by the window.



My laptop was already there, closed, exactly where I’d left it that morning. I opened it anyway. The sent email was still there. I opened it and stared at my name in the header, the timestamp, the proof that I’d done something I couldn’t undo by pretending it hadn’t happened. It still sounded reasonable. Calm. Like it wasn’t asking anything from me yet. Just a conversation. Just information. Just a possibility.



I leaned back in my chair and stared at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack with my eyes. I could say no. I could go to the meeting and decide it wasn’t for me. I could keep my job, keep my routine, keep the careful balance I’d built to make everything work, and nothing bad would happen if I stayed exactly where I was.



And then another thought followed. Quieter. Heavier.



Something would happen if I didn’t go. Not immediately. Not in a way I could point to. Just… eventually. I pictured myself a year from now, standing in the same kitchen, holding the same chipped mug, telling myself I’d been patient. That the timing hadn’t been right. That I’d made the responsible choice. The image didn’t scare me.



That was worse.



I closed my eyes and let the feeling settle where it wanted to. I wasn’t afraid of failing. I was afraid of being seen and having to decide who I was once that happened. I thought about the posting, the language, how familiar it had felt. How it described things I’d already been doing quietly, without permission. I thought about Paige mentioning her meeting like it was nothing. About Julian nodding like it made sense. About Riley smiling like this hadn’t surprised her at all. I thought about how tired I’d been lately and how alive I’d felt that afternoon, just answering a question out loud. The truth arrived without ceremony. I wanted this. Not because it promised anything. Not because it guaranteed change. Because I was curious. Because I didn’t want to look back later and wonder who I might’ve been if I’d stepped forward when the door was already open.



I closed the laptop gently, like I was afraid of startling the thought away. Then I stood, washed the glass I hadn’t used, and turned off the kitchen light. In bed, I stared at the ceiling a while longer, my mind unusually quiet. For the first time in days, I wasn’t rehearsing what I’d say if someone asked. I already knew.



The next morning felt steadier than I expected. Not lighter. Just settled, like something inside me had found its footing overnight even if the path ahead was still blurry. I was carrying a thin stack of paperwork to another floor when the elevator doors slid open and Caleb stepped in.



“Hey,” he said, smiling a little as he reached out to stop the doors. “Hey.” He took the spot beside me without thinking, close enough to feel familiar but not intrusive. Jacket slung over one arm, empty coffee cup in the other, the look of someone who’d stepped outside for air and come back unchanged. “Break?” I asked. “Yeah,” he said. “Figured I owed myself one.” “Did it help?” He tilted his head, considering. “Maybe a little. Not in the way I wanted, though.” I smiled. “That sounds about right.”



The elevator hummed as it started up, the numbers above the door ticking slowly, giving us time we didn’t have to fill if we didn’t want to. He glanced at me again, softer this time. “You seem… okay today.” “Do I?” “Yeah,” he said. “More you.”



I let that sit for a second.



“I think I finally slept.” “That’ll do it,” he said. Then, after a beat, “Or something clicked.” I looked at him, surprised. He shrugged lightly. “You get a look sometimes. Like you’ve made a decision you haven’t announced yet.”



I laughed under my breath.



“Have you always been this observant?” “Only about you,” he said, like it was obvious. Then, gentler, “You don’t have to explain anything.”



I appreciated that more than I could say.



“They reached out,” I said anyway. “At work. Not an offer. Just… a conversation.” He nodded, like he’d already placed that puzzle piece. “And you didn’t shut it down.” “No.” “Good.” The elevator continued its slow climb. “I wasn’t sure I would,” I admitted. “But I didn’t back out.”



He bumped his shoulder lightly against mine, barely there, easy, familiar. “That’s usually how I know you’re serious.” I smiled. “You make it sound like you’ve seen this before.” “I have,” he said. “Different versions. Same look.”



The elevator slowed, chimed, and the doors slid open. “This is you,” he said, stepping back slightly to let me pass. “Yeah.” I stepped by him. “Thanks.” “For what?” “For not making it a thing.” He smiled again, warmer this time. “It already is a thing. I’m just not naming it for you.” I stepped out, my heart a little fuller than it had been when I got in. Behind me, the doors closed, and the elevator carried him away.



The invite came just before lunch. No preamble. No explanation. Just a new block of time appearing on my calendar like it had always been there.



**Subject: Internal Discussion**

**Organizer: Internal Systems & Continuity**

**Duration: 30 minutes**

**Location: Conference Room B / Secure Line**



There was nothing unusual about the formatting. No urgency markers. No flagged importance. Just a standard meeting request, sandwiched between a recurring check-in and a placeholder reminder I’d never bothered to delete. I checked the date.



Tomorrow.



My cursor hovered over the response options. Accept. Tentative. Decline. I clicked Accept. The calendar updated immediately, the block turning solid, locked in place. A small confirmation banner appeared and disappeared just as quickly.

Posted here a few times. 
I started on 30mg Tyvense about 6 weeks ago. Went up to 40mg after 2 weeks and I felt like it made me an anxious wreck. Had a review and I knew I messed up my first round. I was drinking 3 cups of coffee a day. Didn't know I needed to completely cut it out. I've bought decaff (fuck it isn't the same but I'm weaning). The biggest problem for me is I used to vape. To give it up I went on nicotine pouches. I've been on them for about 2 years. I have known for a good while I need to kick them. They literally have me by the liathróidí. Tomorrow under guidance from the psychiatrist I will try my 40mg Tyvense without any coffee or any pouches for 2 weeks. I'm writing this as I hope it relates to anyone with nicotine addiction (and caffeine but I can go without that easily enough). ",2,1766769646.0,ADHDIreland,0,1.0,False

I have a history of eczema, but I haven’t had many flare-ups in the last few years. Since starting carnivore, I’m dealing with a pretty bad flare on my neck. I also had two spots on my arms, but those already resolved on their own.

I didn’t start carnivore for skin issues — my main goals were reducing brain fog and joint pain.

For those who’ve been carnivore longer:

Is it normal to get a bad eczema flare early on, especially after years of being mostly symptom-free? Did this happen during adaptation for anyone else? Or could this point more toward histamine issues, dairy/eggs, or something else?

Winter does this thing                                             where time slows down just enough                           for people to notice each other again.

Winter does this thing to people.                          Coffee tastes more deliberate.                                Hands stay in pockets longer,                                      not because of the cold,                                              but because suddenly touch feels                              like it should mean something.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

1pw9kx2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw9kx2,Looking for help figuring out a better dish-washing system,"Ive lived in my apartment for 3 years and still have not been able to figure out the best way to fit a drying rack into my life. I have a one bay sink. Currently, I wash dishes and stack them on a towel to the right of the sink, and lay a drying mat on the far counter (near coffee machines). Once my towel has filled up with dishes I move them over to the drying rack.
This is clunky and takes up a lot of counter space, not to mention its not very conducive to daily/quick dish washing. Also, I don’t have an in-unit washer/dryer so the drying mats feel ickier than they should (i store them under the sink).

Anyone have any ideas on how I can make this work? I’ve never lived somewhere with a one-bay sink. Ive also tried a drying rack that rolls over the sink, but again this isn’t a great option as i then can’t really use the sink until everything is dried.

Attached photos of the kitchen… looking for any advice!
Sink bay is 24” across, left of the sink is 24” long and 7” wide, right is 24” long and 6” wide.

\- a bit bigger. Not dad-bod yet, but definitely not skinny. Working on it  
\- generic white guy in appearance  
\- stupid mustache (package deal, it's a core part of my personality now)

\- music  
\- writing, sometimes

\- Favorite color: Purple  
\- Favorite food: Nearest  
\- How's the weather: Nice and cold  
\- Dogs or cats: Unconditionally love every dog in existence. Neutral towards cats  
\- Morning or night: depends on the day  
\- Coffee or tea: White Monster  
\- Speak other languages: Korean, allegedly

Requirements for you:  
\- Exist  
\- Be of the female variety (negotiable)  
\- 24-29 ish (flexible)  
\- Single mothers welcome\*  
\- be.. interesting in some way  
\- Preferably US based

Anyway, quick overview:

I'm just a dude doing all a dude can do, really. Been single for... entirely too long. Anyway. I spend my free time listening to music and playing video games. What music? Mostly divorced dad rock, but my playlist has been described as musical whiplash before. What games? Simulators. Sometimes something else, but generally sims. What platform? PC. Yes we could probably play together.

Ideally, in person. Open to long distance, though.

Bad at small talk, even worse at talking about myself sometimes. I try, though

Uhhhhhhhh, not sure what else to put in here. At least drop me a message to give me feedback on this.

Hands stay in pockets longer,                                      not because of the cold,                                              but because suddenly touch feels                              like it should mean something.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

Affection doesn’t knock loudly this season.                   It leans in.It says,                                                        “Stay a little longer.”                                                         It pours another cup.It waits.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

It was handwritten in blue ballpoint pen on the back of a tax receipt pinned to the bulletin board of a 24-hour laundromat in downtown São Paulo.

""NIGHT WATCHMAN - PRIVATE SECTOR. $18,000.00/month + Bonuses. Requirements: No family, military or security background, strong stomach. Discreet. Contact the number below via Telegram only.""

Eighteen thousand dollars.

I read the number three times. At the time, I was living in a boarding house room that smelled of mold and old cooking oil. My bank account had been in the red for so long the manager didn’t even call me anymore. I’m an ex-military police officer, expelled from the force for ""excessive use of force"" and ""incompatible conduct"" (official code for alcoholism).

I had nothing to lose. I sent the message.

The reply came in thirty seconds. A GPS coordinate and a time: 03:00 AM.

The location was the underground garage of an abandoned commercial building in the Sé district. I was frisked by two men built like wardrobes wearing cheap suits. They took my phone, my wallet, my watch. They put a black hood over my head and shoved me into the back of a van.

They drove for four hours. From the swaying and the smell of earth coming through the vents, we left the city and hit a dirt road. Then, we went down. We went down a lot. I felt the pressure in my ears change, like when a plane lands.

When the hood was removed, I was in a white, sterile room lit by fluorescent bulbs.

Sitting at a metal table was Dr. Arantes. A thin man with gray skin and dark circles under his eyes so deep they looked like bruises. He didn’t smile. He didn’t greet me. He just pushed a stack of papers toward me.

“Level 5 Non-Disclosure Agreement,” he said, his voice dry as sand. “If you tell anyone what you see here, you don’t go to jail. You disappear. Your dental records vanish. Your birth certificate is erased. You never existed. Understood?”

“What is the job?” I asked, holding the pen. “Politician security? Organ trafficking?”

“Theological Containment Monitoring.”

I laughed. I thought it was a joke.

Arantes didn’t laugh.

“The salary is deposited into an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. You work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You sleep here. You eat here. Your life outside is over. Sign or leave.”

I signed. My hand shook a little, not from fear, but from alcohol withdrawal.

Arantes gathered the papers and stood up.

“Welcome to Project Cathedral. Let’s go down.”

We entered an industrial freight elevator. The panel had no numbers, just an up button and a down button. We descended for too long. Two minutes? Three?

“We are three hundred meters below the foundation of an 18th-century church,” Arantes explained, staring at the elevator ceiling. “The church above is a façade. What matters is what’s below.”

When the doors opened, the air was freezing. We walked down a concrete corridor lined with steel doors fitted with biometric locks. We reached the end of the hall. A control room.

It was small, claustrophobic, filled with high-resolution monitors, panels with blinking lights, and an industrial coffee maker. But the focus of the room was the window. A pane of reinforced glass, ten centimeters thick, looking into a gray concrete cell.

“That is your post,” Arantes pointed to the worn leather chair in front of the glass. “Sit.”

I obeyed. I looked through the glass.

The cell was a perfect concrete cube, maybe 4x4 meters. No furniture. No bed. No toilet. In the center, on a Persian rug that must have once been red but was now dark brown, a man was kneeling.

He was facing away from me. He wore a black cassock, torn and dirty. His hair was white, thin, falling over his gaunt shoulders. He was rocking his body slightly, back and forth.

“Who is he?” I asked.

“We call him Father Thomas. He is 94 years old. He has been in that room for forty-two years.”

“A prisoner?”

“Working. Just like you.”

Arantes flipped a switch on the panel. Sound invaded the control room.

It wasn’t silence. It was a low, constant hum, like a swarm of bees inside a cave.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh... Sssrr-aaa-tuh... Mmm-glll-w'nah...”

“Is he praying?” I asked, feeling a chill run up my spine. That language didn’t sound human. The consonants were too hard, too guttural.

“He is vocalizing,” Arantes corrected. “It’s a sonic blockade. A specific frequency. As long as he maintains this rhythm, the Door stays closed.”

“What door?”

Arantes ignored the question and pointed to the panel in front of me. There were three large buttons, protected by acrylic covers. Blue, Yellow, and Red.

“Pay attention, Jonas. These are your only responsibilities. The priest does not eat, does not drink water by mouth, does not sleep. He receives nutrition and stimulants intravenously. He wears high-absorption geriatric diapers that we change with robots every 24 hours. Your function is to ensure he does not stop. Ever.”

Arantes pointed to the Blue Button.

“Hydration and mild stimulant. If his voice falters, if he coughs, press Blue.”

Then he pointed to the Yellow Button.

“Shock of adrenaline and pure amphetamine. If he stops rocking. If his head droops. If it looks like he’s going to pass out. Press Yellow. It will hurt him a little. His heart will race to 200 beats per minute. But it will keep him awake.”

“And the Red one?” I asked. The button was larger than the others, with a black and yellow striped warning border.

Arantes looked at the cell. For the first time, I saw fear in that man’s eyes.

“If he dies. If the sound stops for more than ten seconds. If you see... things coming out of the floor. Press Red.”

“What does it do?”

“Total incineration. The cell is flooded with flammable corrosives. Everything inside turns to ash in three seconds.”

“So, that button basically kills him?”

“If we reach that point, Jonas, the priest doesn’t matter anymore. The Red is to seal the room. To ensure nothing comes out.”

Arantes put a hand on my shoulder.

“The shift is 12 hours. Do not sleep. The system monitors your eyes. If you close them for more than five seconds, the chair shocks you. Good luck.”

The first few months were a slow descent into madness. Boredom is the worst kind of torture. You sit there, staring at a dying old man, listening to that sound.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh...”

It isn’t a Christian prayer. I was raised in the church. I know Latin. That was older than Latin. It sounded like the language stones would speak if they had mouths.

I started studying Father Thomas. With the camera zoom, I saw details the glass hid. The skin on his knees didn’t exist anymore. The fabric of the cassock, the flesh, and the rug had fused into a mash of dried blood and pus. He was calcified to the floor. That old man couldn’t stand up even if he wanted to.

His hands, clasped in prayer, had nails grown long and curved, piercing the flesh of his own palms.

But the worst was the face. Every now and then, he would turn his head to the side in a spasm. He had no eyes. The sockets were empty, scarred holes. Someone—or he himself—had gouged them out years ago. And the mouth... the lips were open sores from so much friction.

In the fourth week, I found a ""Journal"" on the control room computer. It was a text file hidden in a system folder. Previous monitors left notes.

Monitor Silva (2015): ""He spoke to me today. Not the prayer. He whispered my name. The audio was off, but I read his lips. How does he know my name?""

Monitor Kowalski (2019): ""The shadows in the cell are wrong. The light comes from above, but the priest’s shadow points to the left. And sometimes, the shadow moves when he is still.""

Monitor Helena (2023): ""I dreamed of what is below. It is an ocean. But not of water. Of teeth. Thomas isn’t praying to God. He is singing to put the baby to sleep.""

Helena lasted three months. The log said ""Termination for medical reasons (psychotic break).""

I started doubting my own sanity. The sound of the prayer entered my dreams. I would wake up in my quarters (a concrete room on the same floor) whispering just like the priest. My throat hurt, as if I had been screaming all night.

In the sixth month, the routine was broken.

It was 02:00 AM. I was fighting sleep, drinking cold coffee.

Father Thomas stopped.

The silence in the room was like a gunshot. The audio monitor showed the flatline of silence. I jumped in my chair, hand hovering over the Blue Button.

But before I could press it, he spoke. In Portuguese. With a clear, young voice that shouldn’t have come out of that destroyed throat.

“Jonas.”

I froze. He was facing away, but I knew he was ""looking"" at me with those empty sockets.

“Press the Yellow, Jonas,” the voice said. “I need strength. He is waking up.”

I didn’t think. I pressed the Yellow Button.

I heard the hiss of the automatic injector in the cell. The priest’s body convulsed violently. His back arched at an impossible angle. I heard bones crack. He screamed—a dry, airless scream—and went back to praying.

But now, the rhythm was frantic. Too fast.

“KhlerrrthumnaghSsrrraaatuuhhMmmglllwnah...”

He sounded like a demonic rapper. The frequency rose. The reinforced glass in front of me began to vibrate.

The red phone on my desk rang. I didn’t even know that phone worked. I answered.

“What did you do?” It was Arantes’ voice. He sounded like he was just waking up.

“He asked for it! He stopped! I followed protocol!”

“The seismic activity level just spiked! You injected too much adrenaline! His heart won’t take it!”

I looked at the vital signs monitor. Heart rate: 210 bpm. Blood pressure: 240/150. The priest was going to explode.

“He is rising!” the priest shouted, breaking the prayer again.

This time, he turned. He rotated his torso 180 degrees. His spine snapped, breaking, but he turned. The eyeless face stared at me. He smiled. Black blood ran from his mouth.

“The door, Jonas. The door is creaking.”

And then, the floor of the cell gave way. It wasn’t a hole. The concrete simply became... liquid. The rug where the priest was kneeling sank. I saw Father Thomas’s body being swallowed by the earth. He didn’t scream. He kept praying as he sank into the gray slime bubbling on the floor.

The prayer became muffled, gurgling, until it vanished completely.

The heart monitor beeped. Flatline.

The sound stopped.

“Arantes!” I screamed into the phone. “He’s gone! The floor swallowed him!”

“The Red!” Arantes shouted. “PRESS THE DAMN RED BUTTON NOW!”

I lifted the acrylic cover. I punched the button. I closed my eyes, waiting for the flash of flammable chemicals, the heat, the explosion that would incinerate everything on the other side of the glass.

But... nothing happened.

The button didn’t work.

I opened my eyes. The cell wasn’t on fire. The cell was glowing.

A sickly violet light emanated from the hole in the floor where the priest had sunk. The temperature in my control room began to rise. 30 degrees. 40 degrees. The plastic on the monitors started to melt. The phone in my hand melted, burning my palm. I dropped it.

And then, the Thing began to emerge.

First, it was the fingers. Long, translucent claws, made of something that looked like smoking glass and TV static. They gripped the edge of the hole in the concrete. The size... my God. Each finger was the size of a grown human.

Then, the head. It had no face. A polygon of flesh and light that constantly changed shape. Looking at it made my eyes bleed. I felt hot, red tears running down my face.

The central computer in the room came to life. A text message appeared on the main screen, giant green letters on a black background.

CONTAINMENT SYSTEM FAILED.

OMEGA PROTOCOL INITIATED.

MANDATORY REPLACEMENT.

The doors to my control room locked. Titanium bars slammed down over the exit. A mechanical needle descended from the ceiling, right above my chair. I tried to get up, but the chair had magnetic locks on the wrists and ankles. They snapped shut with a metallic click.

I was trapped.

“No! No! Let me out!” I screamed.

The needle descended and pierced my neck. I felt a cold liquid invade my veins. It wasn’t poison.

It was clarity.

Suddenly, the fear vanished. The pain vanished. My mind expanded.

I understood.

I understood what Father Thomas was doing. He wasn’t praying to a God. He wasn’t asking for salvation. He was telling a story.

The Entity... Whatever that thing coming out of the hole was... is made of chaos. It is pure entropy. It wants to undo the universe, atom by atom. The only thing keeping it trapped is Order. And the purest form of Order is Repetition. Rhythm. The Word.

The ""prayer"" wasn’t magic. It was mathematics. A sequence of frequencies creating a physical barrier against chaos. A wall of solid sound.

But Thomas had stopped. The wall had fallen. Someone needed to raise the wall again.

The Thing in the cell was rising. It already occupied half the space. The concrete walls were cracking, turning to dust. If it touched the ceiling, if it touched the foundation of the church above... the world would end. Not in fire, but in silence. Everything would cease to exist.

I felt the words rising in my throat. I didn’t know them. But they were in the serum the needle injected. Liquid memory. The knowledge of all the monitors, of all the ""priests"" before Thomas.

My mouth opened against my will. My tongue twisted into a painful knot. The sound came out ragged, weak.

The Thing in the cell stopped. The spinning geometry hesitated. It ""looked"" at me through the glass.

I felt a crushing pressure on my brain, like an ocean trying to fit into a water glass.

“SHUT UP, WORM,” the Thing’s voice echoed in my mind. It was pure murderous intent.

But I couldn’t shut up. The drug in my blood wouldn’t let me. The biological imperative was now: Pray or die.

“Khlerrr-thum-nagh...” I spoke louder.

The Thing recoiled an inch. The black slime on the floor bubbled. It hated the sound. The sound was Order. The sound was a cage.

The Thing let out a screech that blew out the remaining monitors in the room. Glass flew everywhere, cutting my face. But I didn’t stop.

The rhythm took me.

My body began to rock, back and forth, mimicking Thomas’s movement. It was the only way to pump the diaphragm to keep my breath.

The Thing began to shrink. The violet light dimmed. It was being pushed back into the hole by the weight of my words. It fought. Claws scratched the reinforced glass, leaving deep gouges right in front of my face.

But I kept going.

It sank. Slowly, inch by inch, the nightmare returned to the earth. The concrete floor, which had been liquid, began to solidify again, sealing the hole.

In ten minutes, the cell was empty. Only the dirty rug and Thomas’s bloodstains remained.

I sat there, panting, trapped in the chair. I waited for the doors to open. I waited for Arantes to come get me out, congratulate me, give me my money.

But the doors didn’t open.

The needle in my neck injected another dose. Nutrients. Water. Stimulants.

The intercom clicked on.

“Excellent work, Jonas,” Arantes voice said. “The transition was smoother than we expected. Thomas took three days to find the rhythm the first time.”

“Get me out of here!” I tried to scream, but the words didn’t come out. My throat was locked in ""prayer"" mode. I could only make the guttural sounds.

“You cannot leave,” Arantes continued, calm. “The frequency must be maintained within line of sight. The glass is the focusing lens. You are the new projector. The audio system was destroyed, Jonas. Now, it is just your voice. Direct into the room’s acoustics.”

The lights in the control room went out. Only a dim light remained on, illuminating the empty cell on the other side of the glass.

And a new button lit up on the panel in front of me. A button that injected water into my mouth through a tube that came out of the headrest.

“The contract was for life, Jonas. You should have read the fine print. 'Monitoring and Containment'. You are the Containment now.”

That was... I don’t know how long ago. There is no clock here.

My knees hurt, even though I’m sitting. I feel like they are trying to fuse to the chair. My eyes burn. I don’t blink anymore. And my voice... my voice isn’t mine anymore. It is a constant hum, an organic machine built to keep the demon sleeping.

Sometimes, when exhaustion hits and I slow the rhythm, I see it. The floor of the cell starts to sweat that black slime. And I hear its voice, from down below, laughing at me.

“Sing, little bird. Sing until your throat tears. I have all the time in the world. And you only have one life.”

My name was Jonas. Now, I am just the sound.

God help us.

It’s worth admitting that I struggled yesterday anyways, I’ve recently gone through a very abrupt breakup and had a lot of triggers being thrown at me by life lately (literally bumped into a very abusive ex twice in the last few months).

My mum was HUGELY abusive as we were growing up and this is my first time being home for Christmas in 4 years, which might’ve had something to do with yesterday’s emotions.

I’d hidden in my room to cry during the day, my younger siblings were both FaceTiming their partners and had my parents both raving about how happy they are to see their kids with such lovely, healthy people. I’m incredibly happy for my siblings, it just hammered home how alone and behind in life I feel at the moment and how much I miss my ex.

We watched a movie together that night and there was a fight scene that triggered me really badly. I wasn’t expecting that kind of scene or for it to be so graphic, and I tried to hide by leaving the room but as soon as I left I collapsed and started crying and hyperventilating.

At first my family kept watching the film, then about 5 minutes later I heard my brother ask what was happening and my dad came out to try and help me. He rubbed my back and let me come out of it and then gave me a huge hug, and the rest of the family didn’t say anything when i eventually went back into the room.

I just feel like I ruined the whole day?? He was so worried about me and he looked so sad, I’d been so scared of ruining things and I thought I’d done okay by hiding in my room to cry earlier in the day and I’m so disappointed in myself for not making it back to my room when my panic attack hit.

Since that I’ve been struggling with feeling incredibly lonely and just generally out of it (post-panic attack floaty state, so fun). I saw my grandad earlier today and we mostly all talked about my siblings and their partners, and I had to admit being single again and he just looked so sad for me.

I really want to text my ex anyways, I’ve been debating asking her to go for coffee when we’re both back in the area but I’m FIGHTING with myself to not send something more vulnerable like admitting how much I miss her and how much I wish she was still in my life and how sorry I am for ruining that too.

My sister said I’m fucked up and that I should just stop dating for a while, and that made me sad (lmao) because it feels so unfair that these issues I’ve gained from not being loved are now causing me to be unable to accept or find love as an adult.

It’s just a lot. I don’t think I’ve ever cried this much, I’m single handedly keeping Kleenex in business",1,1766769264.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

“Level 5 Non-Disclosure Agreement,” he said, his voice dry as sand. “If you tell anyone what you see here, you don’t go to jail. You disappear. Your dental records vanish. Your birth certificate is erased. You never existed. Understood?”

“What is the job?” I asked, holding the pen. “Politician security? Organ trafficking?”

“Theological Containment Monitoring.”

I laughed. I thought it was a joke.

Arantes didn’t laugh.

“The salary is deposited into an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. You work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You sleep here. You eat here. Your life outside is over. Sign or leave.”

I signed. My hand shook a little, not from fear, but from alcohol withdrawal.

Arantes gathered the papers and stood up.

“Welcome to Project Cathedral. Let’s go down.”

We entered an industrial freight elevator. The panel had no numbers, just an up button and a down button. We descended for too long. Two minutes? Three?

“We are three hundred meters below the foundation of an 18th-century church,” Arantes explained, staring at the elevator ceiling. “The church above is a façade. What matters is what’s below.”

When the doors opened, the air was freezing. We walked down a concrete corridor lined with steel doors fitted with biometric locks. We reached the end of the hall. A control room.

It was small, claustrophobic, filled with high-resolution monitors, panels with blinking lights, and an industrial coffee maker. But the focus of the room was the window. A pane of reinforced glass, ten centimeters thick, looking into a gray concrete cell.

“That is your post,” Arantes pointed to the worn leather chair in front of the glass. “Sit.”

I obeyed. I looked through the glass.

The cell was a perfect concrete cube, maybe 4x4 meters. No furniture. No bed. No toilet. In the center, on a Persian rug that must have once been red but was now dark brown, a man was kneeling.

He was facing away from me. He wore a black cassock, torn and dirty. His hair was white, thin, falling over his gaunt shoulders. He was rocking his body slightly, back and forth.

“Who is he?” I asked.

“We call him Father Thomas. He is 94 years old. He has been in that room for forty-two years.”

“A prisoner?”

“Working. Just like you.”

Arantes flipped a switch on the panel. Sound invaded the control room.

It wasn’t silence. It was a low, constant hum, like a swarm of bees inside a cave.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh... Sssrr-aaa-tuh... Mmm-glll-w'nah...”

“Is he praying?” I asked, feeling a chill run up my spine. That language didn’t sound human. The consonants were too hard, too guttural.

“He is vocalizing,” Arantes corrected. “It’s a sonic blockade. A specific frequency. As long as he maintains this rhythm, the Door stays closed.”

“What door?”

Arantes ignored the question and pointed to the panel in front of me. There were three large buttons, protected by acrylic covers. Blue, Yellow, and Red.

“Pay attention, Jonas. These are your only responsibilities. The priest does not eat, does not drink water by mouth, does not sleep. He receives nutrition and stimulants intravenously. He wears high-absorption geriatric diapers that we change with robots every 24 hours. Your function is to ensure he does not stop. Ever.”

Arantes pointed to the Blue Button.

“Hydration and mild stimulant. If his voice falters, if he coughs, press Blue.”

Then he pointed to the Yellow Button.

“Shock of adrenaline and pure amphetamine. If he stops rocking. If his head droops. If it looks like he’s going to pass out. Press Yellow. It will hurt him a little. His heart will race to 200 beats per minute. But it will keep him awake.”

“And the Red one?” I asked. The button was larger than the others, with a black and yellow striped warning border.

Arantes looked at the cell. For the first time, I saw fear in that man’s eyes.

“If he dies. If the sound stops for more than ten seconds. If you see... things coming out of the floor. Press Red.”

“What does it do?”

“Total incineration. The cell is flooded with flammable corrosives. Everything inside turns to ash in three seconds.”

“So, that button basically kills him?”

“If we reach that point, Jonas, the priest doesn’t matter anymore. The Red is to seal the room. To ensure nothing comes out.”

Arantes put a hand on my shoulder.

“The shift is 12 hours. Do not sleep. The system monitors your eyes. If you close them for more than five seconds, the chair shocks you. Good luck.”

The first few months were a slow descent into madness. Boredom is the worst kind of torture. You sit there, staring at a dying old man, listening to that sound.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh...”

It isn’t a Christian prayer. I was raised in the church. I know Latin. That was older than Latin. It sounded like the language stones would speak if they had mouths.

I started studying Father Thomas. With the camera zoom, I saw details the glass hid. The skin on his knees didn’t exist anymore. The fabric of the cassock, the flesh, and the rug had fused into a mash of dried blood and pus. He was calcified to the floor. That old man couldn’t stand up even if he wanted to.

His hands, clasped in prayer, had nails grown long and curved, piercing the flesh of his own palms.

But the worst was the face. Every now and then, he would turn his head to the side in a spasm. He had no eyes. The sockets were empty, scarred holes. Someone—or he himself—had gouged them out years ago. And the mouth... the lips were open sores from so much friction.

In the fourth week, I found a ""Journal"" on the control room computer. It was a text file hidden in a system folder. Previous monitors left notes.

Monitor Silva (2015): ""He spoke to me today. Not the prayer. He whispered my name. The audio was off, but I read his lips. How does he know my name?""

Monitor Kowalski (2019): ""The shadows in the cell are wrong. The light comes from above, but the priest’s shadow points to the left. And sometimes, the shadow moves when he is still.""

Monitor Helena (2023): ""I dreamed of what is below. It is an ocean. But not of water. Of teeth. Thomas isn’t praying to God. He is singing to put the baby to sleep.""

Helena lasted three months. The log said ""Termination for medical reasons (psychotic break).""

I started doubting my own sanity. The sound of the prayer entered my dreams. I would wake up in my quarters (a concrete room on the same floor) whispering just like the priest. My throat hurt, as if I had been screaming all night.

In the sixth month, the routine was broken.

It was 02:00 AM. I was fighting sleep, drinking cold coffee.

Father Thomas stopped.

The silence in the room was like a gunshot. The audio monitor showed the flatline of silence. I jumped in my chair, hand hovering over the Blue Button.

But before I could press it, he spoke. In Portuguese. With a clear, young voice that shouldn’t have come out of that destroyed throat.

“Jonas.”

I froze. He was facing away, but I knew he was ""looking"" at me with those empty sockets.

“Press the Yellow, Jonas,” the voice said. “I need strength. He is waking up.”

I didn’t think. I pressed the Yellow Button.

I heard the hiss of the automatic injector in the cell. The priest’s body convulsed violently. His back arched at an impossible angle. I heard bones crack. He screamed—a dry, airless scream—and went back to praying.

But now, the rhythm was frantic. Too fast.

“KhlerrrthumnaghSsrrraaatuuhhMmmglllwnah...”

He sounded like a demonic rapper. The frequency rose. The reinforced glass in front of me began to vibrate.

The red phone on my desk rang. I didn’t even know that phone worked. I answered.

“What did you do?” It was Arantes’ voice. He sounded like he was just waking up.

“He asked for it! He stopped! I followed protocol!”

“The seismic activity level just spiked! You injected too much adrenaline! His heart won’t take it!”

I looked at the vital signs monitor. Heart rate: 210 bpm. Blood pressure: 240/150. The priest was going to explode.

“He is rising!” the priest shouted, breaking the prayer again.

This time, he turned. He rotated his torso 180 degrees. His spine snapped, breaking, but he turned. The eyeless face stared at me. He smiled. Black blood ran from his mouth.

“The door, Jonas. The door is creaking.”

And then, the floor of the cell gave way. It wasn’t a hole. The concrete simply became... liquid. The rug where the priest was kneeling sank. I saw Father Thomas’s body being swallowed by the earth. He didn’t scream. He kept praying as he sank into the gray slime bubbling on the floor.

The prayer became muffled, gurgling, until it vanished completely.

The heart monitor beeped. Flatline.

The sound stopped.

“Arantes!” I screamed into the phone. “He’s gone! The floor swallowed him!”

“The Red!” Arantes shouted. “PRESS THE DAMN RED BUTTON NOW!”

I lifted the acrylic cover. I punched the button. I closed my eyes, waiting for the flash of flammable chemicals, the heat, the explosion that would incinerate everything on the other side of the glass.

But... nothing happened.

The button didn’t work.

I opened my eyes. The cell wasn’t on fire. The cell was glowing.

A sickly violet light emanated from the hole in the floor where the priest had sunk. The temperature in my control room began to rise. 30 degrees. 40 degrees. The plastic on the monitors started to melt. The phone in my hand melted, burning my palm. I dropped it.

And then, the Thing began to emerge.

First, it was the fingers. Long, translucent claws, made of something that looked like smoking glass and TV static. They gripped the edge of the hole in the concrete. The size... my God. Each finger was the size of a grown human.

Then, the head. It had no face. A polygon of flesh and light that constantly changed shape. Looking at it made my eyes bleed. I felt hot, red tears running down my face.

The central computer in the room came to life. A text message appeared on the main screen, giant green letters on a black background.

CONTAINMENT SYSTEM FAILED.

OMEGA PROTOCOL INITIATED.

MANDATORY REPLACEMENT.

The doors to my control room locked. Titanium bars slammed down over the exit. A mechanical needle descended from the ceiling, right above my chair. I tried to get up, but the chair had magnetic locks on the wrists and ankles. They snapped shut with a metallic click.

I was trapped.

“No! No! Let me out!” I screamed.

The needle descended and pierced my neck. I felt a cold liquid invade my veins. It wasn’t poison.

It was clarity.

Suddenly, the fear vanished. The pain vanished. My mind expanded.

I understood.

I understood what Father Thomas was doing. He wasn’t praying to a God. He wasn’t asking for salvation. He was telling a story.

The Entity... Whatever that thing coming out of the hole was... is made of chaos. It is pure entropy. It wants to undo the universe, atom by atom. The only thing keeping it trapped is Order. And the purest form of Order is Repetition. Rhythm. The Word.

The ""prayer"" wasn’t magic. It was mathematics. A sequence of frequencies creating a physical barrier against chaos. A wall of solid sound.

But Thomas had stopped. The wall had fallen. Someone needed to raise the wall again.

The Thing in the cell was rising. It already occupied half the space. The concrete walls were cracking, turning to dust. If it touched the ceiling, if it touched the foundation of the church above... the world would end. Not in fire, but in silence. Everything would cease to exist.

I felt the words rising in my throat. I didn’t know them. But they were in the serum the needle injected. Liquid memory. The knowledge of all the monitors, of all the ""priests"" before Thomas.

My mouth opened against my will. My tongue twisted into a painful knot. The sound came out ragged, weak.

The Thing in the cell stopped. The spinning geometry hesitated. It ""looked"" at me through the glass.

I felt a crushing pressure on my brain, like an ocean trying to fit into a water glass.

“SHUT UP, WORM,” the Thing’s voice echoed in my mind. It was pure murderous intent.

But I couldn’t shut up. The drug in my blood wouldn’t let me. The biological imperative was now: Pray or die.

“Khlerrr-thum-nagh...” I spoke louder.

The Thing recoiled an inch. The black slime on the floor bubbled. It hated the sound. The sound was Order. The sound was a cage.

The Thing let out a screech that blew out the remaining monitors in the room. Glass flew everywhere, cutting my face. But I didn’t stop.

The rhythm took me.

My body began to rock, back and forth, mimicking Thomas’s movement. It was the only way to pump the diaphragm to keep my breath.

The Thing began to shrink. The violet light dimmed. It was being pushed back into the hole by the weight of my words. It fought. Claws scratched the reinforced glass, leaving deep gouges right in front of my face.

But I kept going.

It sank. Slowly, inch by inch, the nightmare returned to the earth. The concrete floor, which had been liquid, began to solidify again, sealing the hole.

In ten minutes, the cell was empty. Only the dirty rug and Thomas’s bloodstains remained.

I sat there, panting, trapped in the chair. I waited for the doors to open. I waited for Arantes to come get me out, congratulate me, give me my money.

But the doors didn’t open.

The needle in my neck injected another dose. Nutrients. Water. Stimulants.

The intercom clicked on.

“Excellent work, Jonas,” Arantes voice said. “The transition was smoother than we expected. Thomas took three days to find the rhythm the first time.”

“Get me out of here!” I tried to scream, but the words didn’t come out. My throat was locked in ""prayer"" mode. I could only make the guttural sounds.

“You cannot leave,” Arantes continued, calm. “The frequency must be maintained within line of sight. The glass is the focusing lens. You are the new projector. The audio system was destroyed, Jonas. Now, it is just your voice. Direct into the room’s acoustics.”

The lights in the control room went out. Only a dim light remained on, illuminating the empty cell on the other side of the glass.

And a new button lit up on the panel in front of me. A button that injected water into my mouth through a tube that came out of the headrest.

“The contract was for life, Jonas. You should have read the fine print. 'Monitoring and Containment'. You are the Containment now.”

That was... I don’t know how long ago. There is no clock here.

My knees hurt, even though I’m sitting. I feel like they are trying to fuse to the chair. My eyes burn. I don’t blink anymore. And my voice... my voice isn’t mine anymore. It is a constant hum, an organic machine built to keep the demon sleeping.

Sometimes, when exhaustion hits and I slow the rhythm, I see it. The floor of the cell starts to sweat that black slime. And I hear its voice, from down below, laughing at me.

“Sing, little bird. Sing until your throat tears. I have all the time in the world. And you only have one life.”

My name was Jonas. Now, I am just the sound.

God help us.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

I'm here because I miss having someone I can talk to regularly. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, laugh a little, and slowly get to know without any pressure.

I'm calm by nature, but I enjoy depth. I like conversations that go beyond small talk, a bit of teasing, and that feeling when talking to someone just feels easy. I'm spiritual but not religious, and I enjoy thinking about life, people, and how we change over time. I believe connection should feel natural and safe, not rushed or forced.

I'm a good listener and I genuinely care when I talk to someone. Kindness, honesty, and communication matter to me. I'm not into games, ghosting, or drama. I like people who are warm, emotionally aware, and comfortable being themselves.

I enjoy simple comforts. The smell of fresh coffee in the morning, dark chocolate, instant noodles on lazy days, good music, and quiet evenings. Sometimes an occasional joint helps take the edge off everyday life and slow things down a bit.

I'm open minded about relationships and believe trust, consent, and respect matter more than labels. I'm hoping to meet a nice woman who enjoys talking, sharing thoughts, and building something slowly. Friendship first, connection next, and we see where it goes.

He knows I’m going to use it for iced coffee so he got me some cute cups to make my coffee in. He also bought me a pair of shoes because “I gotta have my baby fly” ☺️

Second, his reaction to his gifts was so cute. I spent an arm and a leg on two Lego sets he’s been eyeing. He saw them and literally ran out of my apartment into the parking lot yelling “My baby love me, y’all!” Then, he proceeded to FaceTime a few of his homeboys to show them. They turned into a bunch of kids again. It was cute. One of his friends was like “Oh hell nah, when the wedding, king?”

Then yesterday me and three of my siblings surprised our 16 year old sister with her first car. She’s the first and only one to get a new car as her first car but she deserves it. The way her face lit up when she saw those keys was everything. I expected her to cry when she saw the car but I didn’t expect her to fall out sobbing the way she did. She was like “IM SO HAPPY IM SO LOVED!” and that hit me right in the heart. Now the whole family in the driveway crying with her. I’m glad we got to give her such a great gift and that she feels loved.

This Christmas was really special. I got to make two people I love feel loved AND I got that love back. The past couple boyfriends were lackluster gift givers at best. So it’s been amazing being with someone who pays attention and truly knows what I like, want, and need. And doesn’t mind spending the money on me. And we’re only like 9 months in.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

Affection doesn’t knock loudly this season.                   It leans in.It says,                                                        “Stay a little longer.”                                                         It pours another cup.It waits.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

1pw9br2,https://i.redd.it/46qae15dzk9g1.jpeg,Lugano Shows What Real Crypto Adoption Actually Looks Like,"You know, Lugano in Switzerland kinda feels like we’ve already stepped into the future, but without all the over-the-top hype or fancy buzzwords. It’s wild you can straight-up pay with Bitcoin for pretty much anything there these days. We’re talking your morning coffee, grabbing some fast food, shopping around town, even settling municipal taxes or paying off fines. And it’s not just some flashy PR gimmick or a tiny trial run that no one touches. People actually use it, and it just works smoothly.

This all kicked off back in 2022 with Plan ₿, which the city put together with Tether. Nothing forced on anyone, no big mandates businesses jump in because it actually benefits them. The whole thing’s kept pretty straightforward: Bitcoin for holding value long-term USDT for those everyday spends since it’s stable, and then there’s this local token called LVGA that handles rewards and loyalty perks. No unnecessary complications.

For the shops and merchants, it mostly boils down to the money side of things. Those Lightning Network fees usually come in way under one percent, while card companies hit you with around three. The city even hooked up hundreds of places with free POS terminals to get started, and if a business doesn’t wanna deal with price swings, they can swap the payment right into Swiss francs instantly. Super practical and reliable.

Then there’s the MyLugano app that really pulls it all together nicely. You pay with crypto, snag some cashback in LVGA, and boom you can spend those on city stuff like parking fees or even childcare. It keeps the money flowing around the local economy instead of vanishing out to big banks or whatever.

Of course, not everyone’s sold on it yet. There are questions about custody, and some folks need time to wrap their heads around it mentally. But honestly, when you look for a real-world example of crypto adoption that’s actually sticking, Lugano’s way out in front. No shouting from the rooftops or empty promises just making it easier for businesses, letting you handle public payments with crypto, and giving locals a reason to keep spending it close to home. That’s what genuine adoption really feels like.",4,1766769014.0,BitcoinCA,0,1.0,False

When it comes to making a choice, we often lock our viewpoint into a simple binary do it or don’t.

If I go, I’m a good person. If I don’t, I’m a bad one. If I accept, the relationship stays intact. If I refuse, it collapses.

But real choice is not a two-slot switch. Choice is work with an interpretation cost, and that cost usually explodes not in the outcome, but in the process of deliberation.

Say a friend suggests meeting up. What happens in my head is not “should I go or not.” It’s a burst of questions.

First, situation, role, energy.
What is this plan actually about. Just a meal, drinks, emotional support.

What role will I be expected to play. Do I need to entertain, listen, spend energy.
Can I handle that with my current condition. Do I have to run another round of social operating while I’m already tired.

Second, relationship risk.
If I decline, what happens. Will they dislike me, grow distant, think less of me.

If I accept, what happens. Will I be exhausted, lose time, have tomorrow’s routine break.

Third, searching for a “partial acceptance” design.
Is there a third option. Can I shorten the time, change the place, change the purpose.

Why should I do it at all. What do I gain, what does it mean.

These questions don’t arise just because I “overthink.” 
They arise because a choice is not two options, but a bundle of combinable variables. Inside the single word “meeting” are the topic, format, time, energy, relationship, and expectations, and those variables become conditions for one another.

When I’m tired, the same plan reads as burden. When it reads as burden, guilt about refusing grows. When guilt grows, judgment blurs. When judgment blurs, the number of questions increases.

So the real problem is not “should I go or not,” but that conditions amplify one another into a single flow, and that flow paralyzes the system.

That’s why I don’t see choice as something that happens because “I lack decisiveness.”

 I see it as what happens when interpretation cost becomes excessive and my ability to operate stops. 

What I need is not stronger willpower or faster conclusions, but bringing the intervention point earlier, before the interpretation cost explodes.

First, I don’t try to settle “go or not” immediately. I spread out the variables that make up the choice.

I shift from “go or not” to “how would I go, for how long, and to do what.”
For example: “only two hours,” “no alcohol,” “switch to a walk or coffee,” “this week is hard, next week instead.” 

The moment I do this, the choice stops being a moral verdict and becomes a design problem.

Second, I pick only one top-weight variable in the current configuration.
Is today about the relationship, is my energy at the bottom, is time the key constraint.

Once the top weight is chosen, the urge to control every variable at once weakens, and I can adjust one sensitive point.

Third, I stop treating the choice as a one-time event and view it on a time axis.
Declining, accepting, or partially accepting doesn’t end in one instance. 

Accumulated over time, the relationship updates its way of reading me, and I also update my own standards system.

So instead of asking “will it be a disaster if I refuse this one,” a more accurate question becomes “what kind of relationship standard gets formed if this pattern accumulates.”

 When that question appears, choice returns. Operation starts again.

In the end, choice is not a fight between doing and not doing. It is the work of lowering interpretation cost, re-aligning the variable combination, and moving my intervention point earlier. Then choice is no longer an emotional war, but an operation.

And if even that process feels too complex and I freeze again, there is one thing to start with immediately.

Clear and honest expression.
What state am I in right now. What feels burdensome. What is possible. What is difficult and why.

The moment I state even one sentence accurately, interpretation cost drops and choice starts moving again.

Clear and honest expression is not emotional venting. It is a technique for intervening in the system before interpretation cost explodes.

 One sentence removes unnecessary guesswork, aligns the interpretation system, and fixes the direction of the relationship more clearly. In that moment, choice returns to a form that can be designed.

Of course, not every relationship can be reduced to this one frame. 

But in my own standards, a relationship where even “speaking clearly” remains consistently difficult is simply too costly.

Put simply: if the relationship wobbles when I speak clearly, that may not be about who is right or wrong.

 It can be a signal that the two people have different thresholds for what they can afford, in cost, in friction, in interpretation load. 

I can acknowledge that difference, but I won’t operate a relationship by continuously absorbing unnecessary interpretation cost.

Ultimately, the point is to locate the bottleneck at the relationship level and design an entry point.

In one sentence: clear expression is not emotional disclosure, but an intervention into interpretation cost. When the cost drops, the relationship becomes not consumption, but progress.",1,1766768997.0,self,4,1.0,False

That's what I tell myself every morning when I look in the mirror, though the man staring back seems decades older. The weight of the past six months has carved lines into my face that weren't there before, turned my dark hair silver at the temples, and hollowed out my eyes until they look like empty windows.

Three weeks ago, I buried my mother. Three months before that, Jane handed me divorce papers with the same clinical detachment she'd reserved for her patients. The divorce papers lay scattered across my chest, each page felt like a small death certificate, documenting the end of everything in my life. Twenty-two years of marriage reduced to a legal document that would divide our possessions and formalize what had been true for months: we were strangers living in the same house, held together only by the fear of being alone. After the divorce I moved out to a small studio apartment, trying to figure out where I stand with Emma. She took it the hardest. The silence between us right now stings like a lingering poison, slowly decaying and destroying the connection we once had as father and daughter.

Somewhere between the funeral and the legal proceedings, I stopped showing up to work. Not intentionally, at first. The insurance firm where I'd spent twenty-three years of my life might as well have been a dream. Numbers, spreadsheets, inspections, client meetings, all of it seemed foreign. My laptop sat closed on the dresser, its surface covered with dust. The missed meeting notifications had stopped coming days ago, replaced by increasingly urgent emails from my supervisor that I couldn't bring myself to open. Twenty-three years of reliability, and I'd thrown it away without even making a conscious decision to do so. The bourbon bottle on the nightstand was half empty. I couldn't remember drinking it, but the burn in my throat and the fog in my head reminded me. I'd been medicating myself into numbness, and it was working too well. The pain was gone, but so was everything else—joy, curiosity, the simple pleasure of being alive. I closed my eyes and tried to remember what it felt like to want something. To look forward to tomorrow. To believe that the future held possibilities worth pursuing. But there was nothing there, just an endless gray expanse where my hopes used to live. My phone buzzed with a voicemail notification from my lawyer. 

“Mr. Esmond, I'm sorry for your loss and you have my condolences. But we need to have a discussion regarding the will and the estate of your mother. Please reach out to me as soon as you can.” 

I groaned, three weeks seems long enough to wallow in my sorrow, the world didn’t stop, I did. I called back and confirmed a meeting. I pulled the covers over my head and tried to sleep, but sleep wouldn't come. Instead, I laid awake in my bed, replaying my mother’s last words to me. She was laying on the hospital bed in her blue patient gown, hooked up to machines like some sick experiment, the sounds of the monitor machine beeping in melancholy tones. I remember her face, it was pale, lacking the blush of life. Her eyes were once a bold dark brown and brimming with life, now it's filled with a dirty yellow hue with remnants of a hint of brown left.    

“Bodie, no matter what happens, I know you will be fine. Grief is love with nowhere to go.”

Those words echoed in my head and my eyes began to swell with tears. I finally passed out.

Now I'm standing in front of the house where I grew up, keys heavy in my palm. The Cottage house sits on 7036 Roses Street like a tired old woman, her pastel yellow paint peeling, her burnt umber shutters askew and the gardens full of weeds and thorns. Mom always said she'd fix up the place ""when she had time."" Time ran out three weeks ago.

I came here to pack things up, to sort through a lifetime of accumulated memories and decide what stays and what goes. The realtor says the house will sell quickly once it's emptied – Cottage homes are popular with young couples looking for ""character and simple vintage feel."" I suppose that's what they call the creaking floorboards and the drafty windows that never quite close properly. The key turns with familiar resistance. The door swings open, and the smell hits me immediately, lavender, old books, lemon oil and something indefinitely maternal. My legs nearly give out. For a moment, I expect to hear her voice calling from the kitchen, asking if I want tea and to sit down for a conversation.,

The silence is absolute.

I set my overnight bag down in the hallway and looked around. I should start with the kitchen, I think. That's always easiest, dishes and utensils don't carry emotional weight. But my feet carry me instead to the living room, where I sink into Dad's old recliner. He died when I was seventeen, and Mom never moved the chair. She'd sit in it sometimes when she missed him, running her hands along the worn armrests. Next to the chair was a small end table and on top of it was a family photo of baby Me, Mom, and Dad, posing in front of the house. They looked so happy and hopeful of the future, just a young couple who eloped and were ready to spearhead any challenge with their baby boy. They were on top of the world. I looked around the living room more intently. The furniture were arranged exactly as she'd left it, two chairs positioned facing each other slightly, the television angled so both could see it, a small table between them, the afghan draped over the back of the sofa that looked out the front window of the house with a coffee table in front of it, and the stack of romance novels on the table, the reading glasses perched on top of them. The space felt like a shrine to the possibility of companionship, to the idea that someone might visit, might stay for coffee, tea and conversation.

The afternoon light filters through the lace curtains, casting familiar patterns on the hardwood floor. I remember lying there as a child, watching those same patterns shift and change as the sun moved across the sky. Mom would be in the kitchen, preparing dinner, and the house would be full of comfortable sounds – the whisper of her dress as she moved, the gentle clink of dishes, the soft hum of whatever song was stuck in her head.

Now there's only silence.

I close my eyes and try to remember the last conversation we had. It was about Jane, about the divorce. Mom had listened with that patient expression she always wore when I was troubled, her hands folded in her lap.

""Sometimes people grow apart, Bodie,"" she'd said. ""It doesn't mean the love wasn't real.""

I'd wanted to argue, to give an excuse or explanation, but that was simply the truth. Jane and I had become strangers sharing a house, polite and distant, going through the motions of a marriage that had died somewhere along the way. But Mom had a way of cutting through my self-pity with quiet but stern wisdom.

""What about Emma?"" she'd asked. ""Have you talked to her about this?""

Emma. My daughter. Twenty-three years old and brilliant, working at a nonprofit in Boston. She'd stopped returning my calls after the divorce papers were filed. I told myself it was because she was busy, that she needed time to process. But the truth was, I'd failed as a husband, and now I am failing as a father. The house settles around me with familiar creaks and sighs. I should make myself something to eat, maybe start going through Mom's papers. Instead, I find myself walking through the rooms, touching things. The banister that guided me up the stairs thousands of times. The kitchen table where I did homework and ate breakfast, lunch and dinners. The back porch where Mom and I would sit in the evenings, watching the fireflies dance in the garden. My old bedroom was exactly as I'd left it when I went to college. School trophies on shelves covered in dust, posters of bands I'd loved when music vainly mattered to me, a desk where I'd written essays and work on projects that piqued a boy's interest at the time. It was a museum of a boy who'd believed in the possibility of winning, who'd thought the future was something you could plan and control. The window still looks out onto the ancient oak tree I used to climb. The doorframe still holds the growth marks Dad used to carve into, documenting my progress from age five to seventeen. Every surface, every corner holds a memory. This house isn't just a building – it's a repository of my entire childhood, a physical manifestation of everything I was before life taught me how to lose things. I sit on the edge of the bed and pull out my phone. 

Emma's number is there, the last text from her dated three weeks ago: ""Sorry about Grandma. Let me know if you need anything.""

I'd never responded. What was I supposed to say? That I needed everything? That I was drowning in grief and guilt and couldn't figure out how to be a person anymore? The phone stays in my hand, heavy with unanswered texts. Outside, the sun sets behind the oak tree, painting the room in shades of gold and amber. This is the light I remember from childhood – soft and warm, filtering through leaves that rustled with life. I'll start packing tomorrow, I decided. Tonight, I just want to sit in this house and remember what it felt like to be whole.

I awoke at 3:17 AM to the sound of the house moving.

Not settling, moving. The floorboards beneath my feet shift and groan with purpose, and the walls seem to breathe around me. I sat up in bed, my heart pounding in my chest, and I listened to the symphony of a house in motion. The rational part of my mind, the part that spent two decades evaluating insurance claims and calculating risk – immediately offers explanations. Old houses make noise. The heating system could be acting up, causing expansion and contraction in the walls. I sat perfectly still, waiting for it to happen again. When it did, five minutes later, I felt a mixture of terror and relief. Terror because houses aren't supposed to move. Relief because it meant I wasn't completely losing my mind.

""Foundation settling,"" I said aloud. The words felt hollow, like a lie I was telling myself to avoid confronting something too large to understand. But this isn't settling. This is movement, deliberate and strange, like the house is walking somewhere. The movement became more frequent. Sometimes it was a gentle swaying, like being rocked to sleep. Other times, it was a definite forward motion, as if the house was walking on invisible legs. The house continues its strange journey, and through the windows, I watch the world outside shift and change. Sometimes it's the neighborhood I remember from childhood, with kids riding bikes and mothers hanging laundry on lines. Sometimes it's the present day, with newer cars and manicured lawns. Sometimes it's something else entirely – rolling hills and distant mountains, as if the house is traveling through landscapes that exist only in dreams.

I grab my phone and turn on the flashlight, stepping carefully into the hallway. The beam cuts through the darkness, revealing walls that look perfectly ordinary. The family photos hang straight in their frames. The runner down the center of the hall lies flat and undisturbed. Yet beneath my feet, the floor continues to shift and sway.

""This isn't happening,"" I whisper to the darkness. ""This is grief. This is stress. This is everything finally catching up with me.""

I've read about grief hallucinations. They're common, especially in the first few months after loss. The mind plays tricks when it's overwhelmed by trauma. It creates experiences that feel real but aren't, filling the void left by the deceased with sensory memories and wishful thinking. That's what this is. It has to be. I make my way downstairs, gripping the banister for support. Each step feels like it's moving beneath me, but the flashlight beam shows everything in its proper place. The living room looks exactly as it did before I went to bed. I settle into the recliner and close my eyes, focusing on my breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. A technique taught to me during one of the marriage counseling sessions with Jane, back when we still believed we could fix what was broken between us. The house continues its strange journey around me.

1pw99wa,https://i.redd.it/hxfuae3zyk9g1.jpeg,Lugano Shows What Real Crypto Adoption Actually Looks Like,"Lugano in Switzerland feels like a glimpse of the future, but without the hype and buzzwords. You can actually pay with Bitcoin there for almost everything. Coffee, fast food, shopping, even municipal taxes and fines. It’s not some PR stunt or pilot that nobody uses. It just works.

This started back in 2022 with Plan ₿, launched by the city together with Tether. No mandates, no forcing anyone. Businesses opt in because it makes sense. The setup is simple: BTC as long-term value, USDT for everyday payments, and a local token called LVGA used for rewards and loyalty. Nothing overengineered.

For merchants it’s mostly about economics. Lightning fees are often under one percent, compared to around three percent with card networks. The city provided POS terminals to hundreds of shops for free, and if a seller doesn’t want volatility, they can instantly convert payments into Swiss francs. Clean and predictable.

There’s also the MyLugano app that ties everything together. Pay with crypto, get cashback in LVGA, and then use that for city services like parking or childcare. It creates a closed loop inside the local economy instead of money instantly leaking out.

Sure, there’s criticism. Custody questions, people taking time to mentally adjust, all that. But as a practical template for real adoption, Lugano is already ahead. No loud slogans, just fewer barriers for businesses, crypto accepted for public payments, and a local incentive to keep it circulating. That’s what real adoption actually looks like.",0,1766768883.0,AltScope,0,0.5,False

1pw98iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pw98iq/will_try_again/,Will try again...,"I have tried quitting caffeine for couple of times now during past years. First time I lasted 1 month, then I drank ""just one cup"" and you know how well that goes..

  
Second time I did week LOL! 

  
Its like one year since I tried stop last time and I actually drank energy drinks and coffee + popped caffeine pills secretly from my family about 10 months.

  
Currently I drink about 3 200mg energy drinks, some pepsi max and tea per day...

Yeah I know what to do and have to make a new plan how to quit. Cannot stop cold turkey really, atleast I feel like I cannot. I have 2 kids and working in tech so I need my brain to function. 

  
Phase 1(2 weeks) No energy drinks or sodas at all. I will change to coffee and tea. Main goal is to get rid of energy drinks and sodas and not too much focus on amount of caffeine. But still I think I will have less caffeine by changing to coffee and tea because those does not taste that good to me. 

Phase 2: 

Lower the amount of caffeime gradually (I will post my plan later here when the first phase is done)

Okay thank you for reading and like everything in life what you want to achieve needs a plan and deadline so here it is.

**Phase 1 starts on Monday 29th of December.**

My GF is incredibly sweet but extremely picky and has a habit of returning at least 50% of the things she buys herself. This makes buying gifts for her extremely difficult.  Over the years she's only liked 1 gift I've gotten her. Even when she picks out the gift, she still wants to exchange it.  This song and dance has gotten frustrating.  This year I thought I nailed it.  I decided to replace her bedding because her current bedding looks like it came off the bed of a broke guy in his early 20's and replace her coffee maker which is at least a decade old .  I gave her the bedding early because I knew what would happen. Of course she wanted to exchange it, picked out a new set then wanted to exchange that. Then Christmas morning I gave her a 100 dollars coffee maker to replace her old Mr coffee and was met with a look of disappointment.  Finally I just told her I don't want to do gift exchanges anymore. I'm not hurt or mad, I just don't want to do it anymore. What's the point of buying a gift when you know you're just gonna have to return it.  She's not rude about not liking the gifts but id rather just cook a nice meal or take her out rather than repeatedly buying shit I know she'll find something wrong with it.

""Wait... didn't your protagonist just turn 16 in chapter 12? How is she 17 in chapter 5?""



I checked my manuscript. Then my timeline spreadsheet. Then my character age chart in Excel. All three said different things.



That's when I realized I had a serious problem.



I wasn't writing a simple linear story. I had flashbacks spanning twenty years, three different POV characters experiencing events simultaneously, and a magic system where time moved differently in different realms. My ""organizational system"" consisted of:



\- A Google Doc with a rough timeline

\- An Excel spreadsheet tracking character ages

\- Sticky notes on my wall showing event order

\- A Scrivener corkboard I'd stopped updating three months ago

\- Pure hope



The worst part? I'm not alone. Even massive franchises with entire continuity departments make these mistakes.



J.K. Rowling had Professor McGonagall teaching at Hogwarts in the 1920s in \**Fantastic Beasts*\*—except canon says she wasn't born until 1935. Marvel's MCU showed Thanos grabbing the Infinity Gauntlet years before he actually acquired it. The \**X-Men*\* films have continuity errors so bad they literally made a movie (\**Days of Future Past*\*) to reset the timeline and fix them.



If billion-dollar studios with armies of script supervisors can't track timelines correctly, what hope do solo novelists have?



That question haunted me until I discovered that the problem isn't talent or effort—it's infrastructure.



\## Why Timeline Stories Are Cognitively Impossible



Here's what I was trying to track while writing my novel:



\*\***Main Timeline:**\*\*

\- 200+ years of world history

\- Character ages across 6 different POV characters

\- Seasonal consistency (because apparently I mentioned ""spring flowers"" in a scene set in November)

\- Travel times between locations (my character once traveled 500 miles in what turned out to be 12 hours)



\*\***Flashback Sequences:**\*\*

\- When each flashback occurred chronologically

\- What information each flashback revealed

\- Which chapter revealed each piece of backstory

\- Making sure I didn't contradict something established 30 chapters earlier



\*\***Multiple POV Timelines:**\*\*

\- Character A's chapter 5 = Character B's chapter 2 = Character C's chapter 8

\- All happening on the same day

\- In three different locations

\- With different information known by each character



And I was trying to track all of this across:

\- My Scrivener manuscript

\- A Google Doc timeline

\- An Excel spreadsheet

\- Handwritten notes

\- My increasingly unreliable memory



The human brain can hold about 7 pieces of information in working memory at once. I was trying to track hundreds of interdependent timeline variables while ALSO writing engaging prose, developing characters, and maintaining narrative tension.



It's cognitively impossible.



That's not an excuse—it's neuroscience. When you're in the flow of writing a scene, your brain is already maxed out tracking dialogue, description, pacing, and character motivation. Adding ""verify this character's age"" and ""check if this event has happened yet chronologically"" on top of that? Your brain literally can't do it.



This is why Raymond Chandler, when asked by Hollywood filmmakers who killed a character in \**The Big Sleep*\*, famously responded: ""Damned if I know.""



The man who wrote the story couldn't track his own timeline.



\## We're Writing More Complex Stories Than Ever



And it's only getting harder.



Modern readers don't want simple linear narratives anymore. They want:



\- \**Cloud Atlas*\* jumping between six time periods

\- \**The Witcher*\* with three interweaving timelines

\- \**Westworld*\* where timeline confusion IS the plot

\- \**Everything Everywhere All at Once*\* with literal multiverse storytelling



Literary fiction is doing it too. \**Life After Life*\* by Kate Atkinson. \**The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August*\*. \**Dark Matter*\* by Blake Crouch. These aren't simple ""once upon a time"" stories—they're temporally complex narratives that demand readers (and writers) hold multiple timelines in their heads simultaneously.



I'm working on a fantasy trilogy with:

\- A main timeline spanning 200 years

\- Flashbacks to ancient history

\- Three POV characters experiencing events simultaneously

\- And—because I apparently hate myself—I'm planning alternate timeline sequences showing ""what if"" scenarios for major plot decisions



When I outlined this, I thought: ""I'll just be really organized.""



Three months in, I had contradictions everywhere. Character ages didn't match. Events happened in the wrong order. I referenced things that hadn't been established yet. My ""organization"" was actively making things worse because I was maintaining five different documents that all contradicted each other.



That's when I started looking for actual solutions.



\## Why Traditional Writing Tools Don't Work for This



I tried everything:



\*\***Scrivener**\*\* has corkboards and labels, but timeline tracking is completely manual. You can organize scenes, but it doesn't know that Scene 12 happens before Scene 3 chronologically, or that Character A ages two years between events.



\*\***Aeon Timeline**\*\* is purpose-built for timelines, but it's completely disconnected from your manuscript. You're maintaining two separate systems. Change a date in one? Better remember to change it in the other. (Spoiler: I never remembered.)



\*\***Excel/Google Sheets**\*\* give you ultimate control, but you're building everything from scratch. I had formulas calculating character ages, color coding for different POVs, tabs for different timeline periods... I spent more time being a database administrator than a writer.



\*\***Pen and paper**\*\* worked great until I needed to reorganize everything. Or search for something. Or not lose the notebook.



The fundamental problem with all of these: \*\***they're separate from your story.**\*\*



Your timeline lives in one place. Your character information lives somewhere else. Your manuscript lives in a third place. When you update one, you have to manually update the others. You won't. You'll forget. And six months later, your beta reader will find the contradiction.



I needed something different. I needed a system where timeline wasn't a separate thing I tracked—it was built into the story structure itself.



That's when I found AYCM Manuscript.



\## How AYCM Manuscript Actually Works (The Main Timeline)



AYCM Manuscript approaches timeline management completely differently. Instead of timeline being a separate tracking document, it's integrated into your story structure.



Here's what that actually means:



\### Everything Connects Automatically



When I create an event in my Main Timeline, I'm not just writing ""Battle of Thornkeep - March 15, 847."" I'm creating a structured event that includes:



\- \*\***The date**\*\* (obviously)

\- \*\***Which characters are involved**\*\* (linked directly to their character profiles)

\- \*\***Where it happens**\*\* (linked to my location/world-building)

\- \*\***Which plot threads it affects**\*\* (so I can track cause and effect)

\- \*\***Which chapters reference it**\*\* (both chronologically and narratively)



The magic is that all of this is interconnected. When I click on a character's profile, I can see every event they've been part of, sorted chronologically. When I look at a location, I see every event that happened there. When I'm tracking a plot thread, I can see all the events that moved it forward.



I'm not maintaining separate documents for events, characters, locations, and plot. It's all one system.



\### Timeline Periods: Organizing Complex Chronologies



My fantasy novel spans 200 years. That's... a lot.



AYCM lets me break the Main Timeline into \*\***Periods**\*\*—think of them like eras or acts. I have:



\- \*\***The Golden Age**\*\* (years 647-712)

\- \*\***The Fracturing**\*\* (years 712-784)  

\- \*\***The War Years**\*\* (years 784-831)

\- \*\***Present Day**\*\* (year 847)



Each Period can have a start date and end date. Events get organized into their relevant period automatically based on their dates. This means I can collapse entire centuries when I don't need to see them and focus on just the period I'm currently writing.



More importantly: the app validates that events fall within their period's date range. If I accidentally put an event from year 850 into ""The War Years"" (which ends in 831), it flags it. No more manually checking if dates make sense.



\### Real-World Dates vs. Fantasy Calendars



Here's something I didn't expect to matter but absolutely does: date systems.



My fantasy world doesn't use the Gregorian calendar. It has its own months, seasons, and year structure. Most timeline tools force you to use real-world dates, which means constantly translating ""Month of Shadows, Year 847"" into ""October 15, 2024"" or whatever.



AYCM Manuscript lets you choose:



\*\***Real-World Dates**\*\*: Perfect for historical fiction, contemporary, or sci-fi set in our timeline. The app uses standard dates and can calculate character ages, time between events, etc.



\*\***Fantasy Calendar**\*\*: Build your own calendar system with custom months, holidays, and eras. The app tracks events using YOUR world's dating system, not Earth's.



For my trilogy, I created a fantasy calendar with 13 months, each 28 days, plus 5 festival days outside the regular calendar. Events are dated using my world's system. When I reference ""the Festival of Lights in Year 843,"" the app knows exactly where that falls chronologically.



\### What This Actually Solves



Before AYCM: I had events in a Google Doc. Character ages in Excel. Location notes scattered across Scrivener. Nothing connected. Updating one meant manually updating everything else. I didn't. Errors everywhere.



After AYCM: I create one event. It automatically shows up in:

\- The main timeline (chronologically ordered)

\- Every involved character's profile (showing their age at that event)

\- The location's history

\- The relevant plot thread's progression

\- Chapter notes where it's referenced



Change the event's date? Everything recalculates. Character ages update. Timeline re-sorts. I'm not maintaining separate systems anymore.



This is what ""integrated"" actually means. And it's the foundation for the really complex stuff.



\## Alternate Timelines: When Your Story Has ""What If"" Moments



Now we get into the really complex stuff.



In my trilogy, there's a pivotal moment in Book 2 where my protagonist has to choose: accept a dark power to save her city, or refuse and let thousands die.



As a writer, I wanted to explore both paths. Not just mention ""what could have happened""—actually write scenes showing the alternate choice and its consequences. Show readers the path not taken.



This is where most timeline systems completely fall apart. You can't just create ""alternate events"" and dump them in your main timeline—they didn't happen in the main timeline. But they're not separate enough to be their own completely independent story either.



They're alternate timelines: branches from the main story that diverge at specific points.



\### How Alternate Timelines Work in AYCM



AYCM Manuscript has a specific structure for this, and it's honestly brilliant.



An \*\***Alternate Timeline**\*\* is created by:



1. \*\***Choosing a divergence point**\*\* - Which event in the Main Timeline does this branch from?

2. \*\***Describing what changed**\*\* - What different choice/event caused the split?

3. \*\***Tracking how events differ**\*\* - After the split, how does this reality unfold differently?



For my story, I created an Alternate Timeline called ""The Dark Path"" that diverges at the moment my protagonist is offered the dark power.



\*\***Main Timeline**\*\*: She refuses. City falls. Thousands die. She's wracked with guilt.



\*\***Alternate Timeline ""Dark Path""**\*\*: She accepts. Gains immense power. Saves the city. Slowly corrupts into something monstrous.



Here's what's brilliant: the Alternate Timeline shares the Main Timeline's history UP TO the divergence point. Everything that happened before the split is the same. Only events after the divergence differ.



This means I'm not duplicating 200 years of world history. The alternate timeline references the same characters, locations, and events as the main timeline—until the moment it branches.



\### Alternate Events: Tracking the Differences



After the divergence point, I create \*\***Alternate Events**\*\* that exist only in the alternate timeline.



Example:



\*\***Main Timeline Event**\*\*: ""Siege of Thornkeep - City Falls (March 15, Year 847)""

\- Protagonist refuses dark power

\- City besieged

\- Thousands die

\- Protagonist survives but guilt-ridden



\*\***Alternate Timeline Event**\*\*: ""Siege of Thornkeep - City Saved (March 15, Year 847)""

\- Protagonist accepts dark power

\- City saved through dark magic  

\- Protagonist hailed as hero

\- First signs of corruption appear



Same date. Same location. Same characters involved. But completely different outcome.



AYCM tracks both versions. I can see them side-by-side. I can compare what differs. Most importantly: I can't accidentally mix them up because they're structurally separated while still being clearly related.



\### Version Tracking (You Can Have Up to 3 Alternate Timelines)



AYCM limits you to 3 alternate timelines per main timeline. At first I thought ""that's restrictive,"" but actually it's smart.



More than 3 alternate realities and you're not writing a story—you're writing a thought experiment. The limitation forces you to focus on the most important divergences.



I'm using:

\- \*\***Version 1**\*\*: ""Dark Path"" (she accepts the power)

\- \*\***Version 2**\*\*: ""Peaceful Resolution"" (she finds a third option through negotiation)

\- \*\***Version 3**\*\*: Still planning this one for Book 3



Each version is clearly labeled, structurally separated, but sharing the same foundational timeline up to its divergence point.



\### Stability Scoring: Is Your Alternate Timeline Actually Coherent?



Here's something I didn't know I needed: AYCM calculates a \*\***stability score**\*\* for each alternate timeline.



It analyzes:

\- Event consistency (do events logically follow from the divergence?)

\- Character arc maintenance (are characters behaving consistently?)

\- Plot integrity (does the alternate plot hold together?)

\- Divergence impact (how much has changed, and does it make sense?)



My ""Dark Path"" timeline has a stability score of 87%. The ""Peaceful Resolution"" timeline is at 72%, which flagged some issues. When I looked closer, I realized I hadn't thought through how the peaceful resolution affects later events—there were gaps in causality.



The stability score isn't telling me my story is ""bad."" It's telling me: ""Hey, this alternate timeline has some logical inconsistencies you should address.""



It's like having a beta reader specifically checking if your alternate reality makes internal sense.



\### What This Solves: No More Timeline Bleed



Before AYCM, when I tried writing alternate timeline scenes, I kept accidentally referencing events from the ""wrong"" timeline. My protagonist would mention something that only happened in the alternate version, while I was writing the main timeline.



""Timeline bleed"" is what I call it: when details from one timeline contaminate another.



With AYCM's structure, alternate timelines are clearly separated. I can't accidentally put an alternate event into the main timeline—they're different entities in the system. When I'm viewing the main timeline, I only see main timeline events. When I switch to viewing ""Dark Path,"" I see the shared history plus the divergent events.



It's structurally impossible to mix them up.



\## Multiverses: When Realities Are Completely Independent



Alternate timelines branch from your main story. Multiverses are something else entirely.



A multiverse story doesn't ask ""what if this one choice was different?"" It asks: ""what if the entire WORLD was fundamentally different?""



Think:

\- \**Everything Everywhere All at Once*\* - completely different realities where Evelyn made completely different life choices

\- \**Dark Matter*\* by Blake Crouch - parallel worlds where characters live entirely different lives

\- Fantasy stories with multiple planes of existence - each with its own rules, history, and physics



The key difference: \*\***No divergence point.**\*\* These realities didn't branch from a single moment—they were always separate.



\### Why AYCM Separates Alternate Timelines from Multiverses



AYCM has a completely different structure for multiverse stories, and understanding why matters.



\*\***Alternate Timelines**\*\* share the same history up to a divergence point. They're asking: ""What if this one thing changed?""



\*\***Multiverses**\*\* are completely independent realities. They're asking: ""What if the entire world was different from the beginning?""



In AYCM, you can have:

\- \*\***Either**\*\* alternate timelines (up to 3)

\- \*\***OR**\*\* multiverses (up to 10)

\- \*\***But not both**\*\* in the same project



At first I thought ""why the restriction?"" Then I realized: if you have both alternate timelines AND multiverses in the same story, you're writing something so complex that even Marvel Studios struggles with it.



The restriction forces narrative clarity. Are you writing branching paths from one timeline? Or completely separate realities? Pick one. Your readers will thank you.



\### How Multiverses Work in AYCM



I'm not using multiverses in my current trilogy, but I tested the feature while planning a sci-fi project, so here's how it works:



Each \*\***Multiverse**\*\* gets:



1. \*\***Complete timeline independence**\*\* - Its own events, chronology, world-building

2. \*\***Separate date system**\*\* - Can use real-world dates OR its own fantasy calendar

3. \*\***Unique character versions**\*\* - Same character names, completely different lives

4. \*\***Organizational connection to the main timeline**\*\* - For reference, not continuity



That last point is subtle but important. Multiverses reference the original timeline organizationally (so you remember why you created them and how they relate), but they don't share history with it.



Example:



\*\***Main Timeline (Universe A)**\*\*: Standard fantasy world, medieval-ish tech, magic exists



\*\***Multiverse ""Tech Universe"" (Universe B)**\*\*: Same world geography, but magic never existed. Technology advanced instead. Industrial revolution happened 500 years earlier.



\*\***Multiverse ""Eternal Winter"" (Universe C)**\*\*: Same world, but catastrophic climate shift 1000 years ago. Entire planet frozen. Survival-focused civilization.



Each universe has completely different:

\- Political structures  

\- Technological levels

\- Historical events

\- Character backstories



They only share: basic geography (same continents) and character names (though the characters themselves are completely different people).



\### Visual Organization: Color-Coded Multiverse Tracking



One feature I love: each multiverse gets its own color automatically.



When I'm looking at Universe A, everything is blue-themed. Switch to Universe B (Tech Universe), it's orange. Universe C (Eternal Winter) is teal.



This sounds trivial, but when you're deep in writing and switching between realities, that immediate visual cue of ""which universe am I in right now?"" prevents so many errors.



It's the same principle as why surgeons use different colored instruments for different procedures—reduce cognitive load through visual differentiation.



\### What This Solves: True Multiverse Storytelling Without Chaos



The challenge of multiverse stories isn't just tracking multiple timelines—it's keeping them completely separate while still being able to see them together for comparison.



If I'm writing a scene in Universe B and I want to reference how differently the same character behaves in Universe A, I need to see both versions simultaneously without contaminating one with details from the other.



AYCM's multiverse structure gives you:



\*\***Separation**\*\*: Each universe is structurally independent. You can't accidentally put Universe B events into Universe A's timeline.



\*\***Comparison**\*\*: You can view multiple universes' timelines side-by-side to compare how events differ.



\*\***Coherence**\*\*: Each universe has its own internal logic, validation, and consistency checking.



For writers attempting true multiverse narratives (and honestly, be careful—this is narratively dangerous territory), having this level of structural support is the difference between ""ambitious"" and ""incomprehensible.""



\## How This Actually Changes Your Writing Process



Let me show you what this looks like in practice.



\### Before AYCM: The Spreadsheet Nightmare



\*\***Writing a scene:**\*\*



1. Write dialogue and action

2. Realize I need to check character's age

3. Open Excel spreadsheet

4. Find character row

5. Calculate age based on event date

6. Return to manuscript

7. Lost my flow

8. What was I writing again?



\*\***Checking if an event has happened yet:**\*\*



1. Open Google Doc timeline

2. Ctrl+F search for event

3. Check date

4. Compare to current scene date  

5. Wait, which calendar am I using?

6. Check notes

7. Still not sure

8. Just wing it and hope for the best



\*\***Adding a new event:**\*\*



1. Add to Google Doc timeline

2. Update Excel with affected characters

3. Update character age spreadsheet

4. Add notes in Scrivener

5. Update plot thread tracker

6. Forget to update two of these

7. Create contradiction

8. Beta reader finds it six months later



\### After AYCM: Integrated Workflow



\*\***Writing a scene:**\*\*



1. Write dialogue and action

2. Need to check character age?

3. Click character name (it's linked)

4. See their age at every event automatically

5. Immediately back to writing

6. Flow maintained



\*\***Checking if an event has happened yet:**\*\*



1. Look at timeline view

2. Events are chronologically sorted

3. Current scene marked

4. Immediately see what's happened before/after

5. Back to writing in 10 seconds



\*\***Adding a new event:**\*\*



1. Create event with date, characters, location

2. Everything auto-updates everywhere

3. Character ages recalculate

4. Event appears in timeline

5. Shows up in character profiles

6. Linked to location

7. One action, everything updated

8. Zero contradictions



\### The Real Workflow Difference



The biggest change isn't features—it's cognitive load.



I'm not constantly context-switching between manuscript, spreadsheet, timeline doc, character notes, and world-building wiki. Everything's in one place, interconnected, updating automatically.



My brain can focus on: Is this dialogue good? Does this scene have tension? Is my protagonist's emotional arc landing?



Instead of: Wait, how old is she? When did that battle happen? Have I mentioned this yet? Which timeline is this event in?



That shift from ""timeline administrator"" to ""actual writer"" is massive.



\## What About Non-Linear Narratives?



My story isn't told chronologically. I have flashbacks, time jumps, multiple POVs experiencing events in different order.



AYCM handles this through the chapter referencing system.



Each event tracks:

\- \*\***When it happened chronologically**\*\* (the actual date in-world)

\- \*\***When it's revealed narratively**\*\* (which chapter mentions/shows it)



Example:



\*\***Event**\*\*: ""Betrayal at Summersend (Year 823)""

\- Chronologically: Year 823 (24 years before ""present day"")

\- Revealed narratively: Chapter 17 (as a flashback)

\- Also referenced in: Chapter 3 (foreshadowing), Chapter 29 (consequence)



I can view my timeline either:

\- \*\***Chronologically**\*\*: How events actually happened in-world

\- \*\***Narratively**\*\*: The order readers experience them



This separation is critical for non-linear storytelling. The event itself is in the timeline where it chronologically belongs, but I can track where/when readers learn about it.



No more ""did I already reveal this information?"" confusion.



\## Who Actually Needs This Level of Timeline Management?



Not every story needs AYCM's timeline features. If you're writing a straightforward contemporary romance that takes place over three months in one location, you probably don't need alternate timeline tracking.



But you DO need this if you're writing:



\*\***Historical Fiction Spanning Decades:**\*\*

\- Multiple generations of characters

\- Tracking ages across 50+ years

\- Historical events that must be dated accurately

\- Character births, deaths, marriages across timeline



\*\***Epic Fantasy with Complex Chronologies:**\*\*

\- Hundreds/thousands of years of world history

\- Multiple POV characters in different locations

\- Magic systems where time works differently

\- Ancient events that impact current plot



\*\***Time Travel Stories:**\*\*

\- Multiple time periods

\- Causality tracking (what affects what)

\- Character ages across different time periods

\- Avoiding paradoxes



\*\***Multi-POV Narratives with Simultaneous Action:**\*\*

\- Different characters experiencing same events differently

\- Coordinating when information is revealed to each POV

\- Ensuring events align when perspectives intersect



\*\***Alternate Timeline Stories:**\*\*

\- ""What if"" scenarios explored as full narrative threads

\- Branching paths from key decision points

\- Comparing outcomes across timeline versions



\*\***True Multiverse Narratives:**\*\*

\- Completely independent parallel realities

\- Same characters, different lives across universes

\- Complex reality-hopping mechanics



If you're nodding along to any of these, traditional timeline tracking probably isn't cutting it.



\## The Learning Curve (Let's Be Honest)



AYCM Manuscript isn't ""open and start typing."" There's setup involved.



You need to:

\- Create your timeline structure (periods, if you're using them)

\- Set up your date system (real-world or fantasy calendar)

\- Build character profiles

\- Create locations

\- Input events with all their connections



This takes time. My initial setup took about a week of inputting world-building, character details, and timeline events I'd already written.



But here's the thing: \*\***I was going to track all of this anyway.**\*\* The question was whether I tracked it in five separate documents that don't talk to each other, or in one integrated system.



The upfront investment pays off massively once you're actually writing. Every event I add from that point forward takes 2 minutes and updates everywhere automatically. Compare that to updating a spreadsheet, then a timeline doc, then character notes, then...



\### What It Doesn't Do



AYCM Manuscript won't:

\- Write your story for you (obviously)

\- Magically fix plot holes (it'll help you FIND them, but you still have to fix them)

\- Prevent all timeline errors (you can still input wrong dates)

\- Make complex storytelling ""easy"" (it makes it \**manageable*\*)



It's a tool, not magic. But it's a tool specifically designed for the exact problem we're discussing.



\### The Sync Situation



Everything syncs across devices via iCloud. I write on my Mac at home, add events on my iPad at coffee shops, check character ages on my iPhone when I'm away from my desk.



This matters more than you'd think. When a plot idea hits me on the bus, I can immediately check if it creates timeline contradictions without waiting until I'm home at my computer.



\## What Changed for My Writing



I'm not going to claim AYCM Manuscript transformed me into a bestselling author or anything absurd like that.



What changed:



\*\***Time spent on timeline admin: 40% → 5%**\*\*

I still check dates and verify consistency, but it's quick lookups, not maintaining parallel systems.



\*\***Timeline errors found in revision: \~30 → 3**\*\*

My beta readers still found three continuity errors. But compared to the thirty-ish in my previous manuscript? Massive improvement.



\*\***Cognitive load while drafting: Significantly reduced**\*\*

I'm not constantly pulling myself out of scenes to verify dates. Information is a click away, then I'm back to writing.



\*\***Confidence in alternate timeline coherence: Actually have some now**\*\*

The stability scoring and structural separation means I can write alternate timeline scenes without constantly second-guessing if they contradict the main timeline.



The biggest change is psychological: I'm not terrified of complex timeline structures anymore. I know I have infrastructure that can handle it.



\## The Bottom Line: Infrastructure Matters



Timeline errors aren't a sign of bad writing. They're a sign of insufficient infrastructure.



Raymond Chandler couldn't track who killed a character in his own book. J.K. Rowling created timeline contradictions in the \**Fantastic Beasts*\* series. Marvel Studios has continuity errors despite armies of script supervisors.



This is fundamentally hard. It's not solvable through willpower or being ""more careful.""



It requires systems that reduce cognitive load instead of adding to it.



For writers working on timeline-heavy stories—historical fiction spanning decades, fantasy with complex chronologies, sci-fi with time travel, alternate timeline narratives, or true multiverse stories—the question isn't ""do I need timeline tracking?""



The question is: ""Do I maintain five separate documents that contradict each other, or do I use an integrated system?""



I chose integrated. AYCM Manuscript is that system for me.



Is it perfect? No. Is there a learning curve? Yes. Does it eliminate all timeline errors? No.



But does it let me write complex timeline stories without having a mental breakdown?



Yeah. It does.



And honestly, that's enough.



\---



\**For writers interested in trying AYCM Manuscript, it's available for iOS and Mac. Fair warning: there's a learning curve, but if you're already maintaining multiple timeline documents, you're dealing with complexity anyway—might as well have it all in one place.*\*",1,1766768553.0,AuthorLounge,0,1.0,False

He has two autistic teenager (adult now) so they agreed to bird-nesting taking turns supervising the kids. He gave her a house and lump sum for the divorce and promised to helped her get on her feet for 5 years plus all education paid for (she doesn’t work). After 5 years and her crying he continue to support her. My bf is a pilot and his ex had a fiancée then so when he flies she stays and when he’s home she leaves. Bf doesn’t want to commute from his base but agreed to end this living situation when he retires. He said he will put a for sale sign up the day he retires. It never happened. His ex has multiple serious relationships and always threatens to leave. 
Fast forward to 2020. I am losing my job because of the pandemic and since he will be retiring in a year he asked me to retire so we can be together. I did. I was shocked when I arrived at his home that the ex has moved in. He said she has yet another break up and has nowhere to go. It would be safer for the boys during the Pandemic shut down. He said it would be temporary. Since then she settled in and never left. She pretended to be my best friend at first. Buying me presents and inviting me out for coffee. I tried to be courteous without letting her too close as she tries to get me to talk about my bf and would ‘unintentionally’ tell me his secrets. Once she talk about her delivery with him in the car like I wasn’t there. I tried to be part of the family by babysitting the kids when he was flying and she was on vacation with her new boyfriend. But after a while I learn to keep a distance when she blamed me for her son’s behavior and reprimanded me for giving them one small treat. To avoid conflict I start to keep my respectful distance.
It’s been almost 5 years now. Instead of buying them a house as promised (she sold hers) and starting a new life with me, we are still in limbo. I kept myself to his room 90% of the time since she lord about in his house. She would walk in and out of our room like it’s her own and only moved her clothes out of our closet a year ago after I put a camera in suspecting somebody’s been rummaging my stuff. My laptop’s power port was fried twice since I took the camera out and Apple’s staff was puzzled since it’s has been damaged by liquid. Sugary liquid! Today our room still kept HER leopard print African motif decoration like she would be moving back in any day. I have been expressing my unhappiness for two years now. But nothing changed. He said she is here because of the boys. That I want to throw his boys out and until I see this family dissolved I wouldn’t be happy. 
Bf was diagnosed with two kinds of cancer this May and had four surgeries. Luckily all benign. I was with him all the way. But since then I noticed their relationship doesn’t seem like what he told me (no interaction other than concerning the boys). She hugged him tenderly before he goes off to surgery. He went to a massage she bought him without telling me. When caught he said it is lie by omission which is not a lie. They plan family movie dates together. Not to mention he has been buying her flowers on birthdays, Mother’s Day etc as long as we’ve been together. I told him I couldn’t do it any longer. We either get married or he sell the house. Now he thinks I’m threatening him and told her everything. I feel that they are plotting against me. She doesn’t have a man now and wants to keep him. She is doing everything in her power to get rid of me. 
I love him. And because of that I’ve been enduring all these without telling a soul. Now he said it’s a lot of money to buy them a house and find a place for us to live. But all I know is she doesn’t want to move and he is not going to make her. Maybe I’m not worth the money to be spent? Should I leave? I am exhausted and feeling hopeless. And I’m not even family.

1pw8v44,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Plastic_Cheetah_7093/comments/1pw8v44/am_i_bad_son/,Am I Bad Son?,"Hi

I grew up in a working family,my parents are government employees who worked hard and gave me good education, food and fullfilled all my needs. I was a good son till i started asking questions and started taking my own decisions.

  
Decision :

Chose a girl from a different culture and lower caste since i loved her but my parents were against me. My mom did all indirect actions that could fuel up hatred among both of us. I ran away from house to be with her and married her but later got divorced coz our relationship was filled with so much hatred about what happened before getting married and she disrespecting my Mom in our daily conversations. She started accusing me on tiny things.. i kept quiet. She slapped me .. i kept quiet until one day.. she torned her clothes and threaten to call 911 and put me into a fake case. I was shattered and ran away from the house and filed a divorce.

For two years , i kept crying about what happened to my life and started building things again after divorce. I met another girl, we clicked and decided to get married. She is strong, opiniated, fights for old traditional taboo about what women should do in marriage. 

The Marriage Day Came!

My family arrived from India. I booked a nice hotel room in a city where all arrangements were kept instead of my home which is like 100Km away and we had to travel everyday, so i chose to stay close.

Problem:

1. My Brother kept insisting to go back to house where home cooked meal can be prepped by my mom coz hotel food was costly and I use to bring food late around 12:00 Noon as all restaurant open late in that area.I know that was my mistake and i told them upfront, there could be some problems , plz adjust..

  
They kept talking among themselves how, I can't arrange food. I offered to bring a quick coffee and a small bagel for quick snaking before i can bring paranthas. They denied. I told them to bring and pack few parantha when we left our home for hotel so that mom can have it in the morning, or a small bread with coffee or tea, they denied.

Cocktail Party: A day before marriage

My brother fought me as he didn't like staying in hotel and asked me drop him back to my house 100 km away \[ It was my day of marriage when he did that and said he will not come\] . I was shattered, we argued ..he became more adamant... He asked me to kiss his feet and then he will agree to come to marriage... I cried..My councious knocked... I kept quiet but finally..i kissed his feet... WHY?... What i will do on my marriage without my brother ... crying.... i did everything to keep them happy.

They wanted me to take them for shopping, i told them i have a pre-wedding shoot, i can't go but they didn't understand...

11:00 PM -- We were enjoying our cocktail party and suddenly my mom came and said lets go home.. i was like what? its my party.. me and wife are on stage.. she said lets go its late.. I was shattered again ...argued ..she made faces..but we left ...My wife was sad...

Marriage Day:

No happiness on their faces. I was getting ready.. my brother didn't come to me and help me out.. i managed on my own....

Got married \[ Happiest day of my life but sad within about what happened in last 3-4 days\] .. i kept going...

  
Reception Day:

Me and wife rushed to bring breakfast\[next day honeymoon night\] ... It was late again around 11:30 am we brought breakfast.. not because we woke up late but because the restaurant opened at 10:30am and it takes 30 minutes one way.

They ate with faces... me and wife kept going..

Evening -- I am getting ready.. My mom,brother,sister,bro in law--left and went to see tourist destinations ... I was alone at my hotel room.. got ready... reached the palace.. My parents didn't show up.. No one told me how i looked, no one corrected me.. i was on my own.. my wife did some make up so that i look good in the photographs... i loved her gesture...

We had a performance.. my family was no where....they finally reached on time... i wasn't focused on them as by now i knew i had to live my day....

  
We danced... I saw them smiling.. my brother never smiled in any functions.. not this one either. My MIL asked my brother to enjoy and dance.. He told her.. i have seen ppl like these, i can't dance among them... She didn't say anything and kept [quiet.My](http://quiet.My) mother said the next day... how funny these people dressed ...

My wife told me the next day what my brother said to her mom... I didn't confronted him coz.. we have to take them to tourist places and have them enjoy.

Me within cried, talked to my dad\[they didn't bring him\], my face looked happy but i was sad within...

They left for India..

My Wife called them everyday for first 2 months.. One day she didn't called.. she never got a call back...

My wife called my Dad... My dad asked if i was ok.. i said talk to her the way you talk to me.. I want everyone to be together.. My mom instructed my dad not to talk... slowly those conversation died..my wife stopped calling.. My sister barely called her and welcomed her in family..

She was disappointed..talked to me..i said i will fix it..she said no don't talk about this.. She knew it will get worse if i did... But indirecty i asked my family to call her randomly so that she dnt fell alone in family... they did 2-3 time and then stopped.

  
Usual Life after Marriage:

I am happy,she's is happy... 

Whenever i talked to my Dad, he said..your mom said you didn't treated them well in canada. They felt humiliated.. You dind't took them to good shopping...you didn't give them good food.

Seriously -- 5 days in hotel with lavish breakfast ,Lunch at in laws house and dinner at pricy hotels... Just coz it wasn't home cooked food?

  
At this point.. I was sure I am not wrong here. I didn't everything in my capacity to keep them happy but i can't change the negative personality they have....

Till Today... I call my mom once a week... we dnt have happy conversations...we fight at things they did on my marriage and how they treated one child as a slipper and another as a king...

The fights diminished as I started understanding about each individual in marriage. Earlier i was mad she can't cook food timely... she doesn't listen to my old thoughts coz I changed for her.. I improved my mind set. I became open and accepted all the things i once thought were shamefull like -- going into parties and dancing\[ i realised its very normal for people to enjoy \] , Had few drinks \[ realized its not bad untill you don't over do \], she dont drink but happy to sever it to friends in house parties and i was against that but later on i realised its not an issue , its my mindset.

I started indulging more with my inlaws, my brother in law as I was happy, I can talk my heart. I can say things without being judged.

I am here today to ask you wonderful people...

  
Am i wrong ? If i changed myself to be good and keep up with society?

Am i wrong ? If i gave preference to my wife over my mother?

Am i wrong ? if i gave preference to my in law who treated me with respect?

Am i a bad son who came back to house by 7:00 PM, went on walks with my mon? Took care for her when she was sick, took her to sabzi mandi everytime.. Never went out party ... never had drinks.. never wasted money...untill i started earning..and saw i was traditionally behind and society was open minded and i was not and i decided to change?

I talked to mom today...I said i have sugar... my eating hobbits have not been good. My wife is pregnant . She works 12 hours a night and comes back and sleep.

My MIL send food around 11:00 AM. We eat it happily. She cooks sometimes and i have no complaints when she don't as she is pregnant and she is also a human who needs rest.She cooks whatever i ask her... she never said never unless its unhygienic food

Am I wrong guys?

I think I could make some improvements here with a much smaller budget than a full renovation. I’m just having trouble seeing how to improve the space. (Yes we have a ton of plants, some are in for the winter and some live here bc of the amazing lighting).
-We like to sit in here for coffee so want to keep seating for two—table can be much smaller and I was considering doing a built in bench with storage but I’m not sure where to put it so everything else stays functional. Maybe in front of the radiator with built in air flow?
-would like to figure out increased storage and prep/counter space. I love vintage furniture so could find old stuff to repurpose or buildout cupboards—maybe the back wall? This would hold pantry stuff, small appliances. We have basically no prep space in the kitchen area so if I could have an area of counter space that would be so helpful—
-much incorporate coffee station as there is no room for this in current kitchen. 
Is this possible? Am I asking for too many things to do in this small space without having it be too cramped and cluttered?

Yesterday for Christmas, I got a milk frother from my sister, which I was super happy about because the only hot drink that I like it hot chocolate (I have a massive sweet tooth lol). I didn't use it yesterday, but today at about 1.30 I decided to use it for the first time. I looked in the kitchen but I couldn't find it, so I gave up and went back to gaming.

About an hour and a half later. my mum & stepdad got back with my baby brother from the Christmas sales (she wanted to find more babygros for him). I said hi to them and had a chat with them, and then I asked if they had seen my milk frother, as I said it had gone missing.

This seemed to annoy my stepdad as he said it hasn't gone missing, he had just put it away. I said ok, but it's not really putting it away if it doesn't have a place yet or if I hadn't been told where he put it, and I joked that it's basically hiding it.

He then started to get heated, saying that he needed to clear the countertops (we have plenty of free countertop space, he had just decided to put it in a big draw with lots of other things, and he put it at the back) I then said he could have just moved it out of the way of the appliances he wanted to use (it was next to the coffee machine, and very close to the air fryer, but he didn't need to move it to use the coffee machine, and he didn't use the air fryer). He then got really angry and said 'you know what', and just took it out and almost threw it on the countertop, which nearly broke it. I told him to not do that, because it could break it. 

At this point, my mum jumped in and she said that I don't tidy the house in the way they do. This is fair, as I clean up after myself and I sometimes do the dishwasher, but I don't hoover/dust anywhere. However, my mum does really like cleaning (I got her a steam cleaner yesterday, which she said she loves and she already tried on the shower grouting) I said that's fine but Teo shouldnt move my things without telling me when he hasn't told me where they should go. 

This is where I may be in the wrong. I was really mad so I took one of his presents, a plush basketball (he really likes basketball) and put in in his & my mums room. About five minutes later, my mum storms in to tell me to 'put back whatever I hid' from my stepdad. I told her that I was just tidying away, that plushies should belong in bedrooms and not in the living room. My stepdad then storms in and tells me that he will 'lock my Internet for days'

(Side note: my parents have this special Internet that lets then turn off the Internet for specific people in the house, and determine bedtimes for when the Internet turns off at night and goes back on in the morning. My mum has said that it will always be like this no matter how old I get, even if I bring my own family over then my husband/kids would have Internet bedtimes, but that's a whole different discussion)

My mum tells him that she will handle it, and she starts shouting at me at this point. This is where I give in, because she is holding my baby brother and he starts crying, which breaks my heart because I am partially causing this, so I then go upstairs and throw down the plush because I am so done with Teo at this point, and how my mum always takes his side no matter what. I then go back to gaming because I don't want to deal with either of them right now. 

My mum comes in to talk to me later and reiterates her point that I don't tidy like them, and it was ridiculous of me to call what he did 'hiding'. I asked her if she thought it was acceptable for my stepdad to shout at me like that, when I hadn't raised my voice at him. She said no, but she'd spoken to him separately (she's 'spoken to him seperatley multiple times about his volume and he hasn't changed at all, and we've had multiple fight about his tone and volume, which my mum defends as English isn't his first language) and that we weren't talking about him. we were talking about me and my actions.

I then sighed loudly because I'm tired from all of this, and it's meant to be Boxing Day and I don't want to deal with this. She then scoffs and storms out of the room, leaving me on my own. I then send her some texts (screenshots attached) about me wanting an apology and it's not right for him to talk to me this way.

I’m hyper-aware of my teeth now and I have fears they will all just fall out (I have 27 as I have no wisdoms) it’s hard to chew, I cant manage meats or anything that isn’t soft, and (obviously) my unemployed ass can’t afford dentures let alone implants lol. 

I stopped smoking and this is the worst I’ve ever felt in my life. There’s absolutely no relief. I’m due a medication change, but because I haven’t had a recent ECG I need to wait over 2 months for that before we even think about starting the Abilify (which might not even work). I’ve been prescribed Promethazine to help me sleep/with anxiety along with my lamotrigine (which I’ve told my provider I’m sure is doing nothing but actively speeding up the decay in my mouth - obviously I’ve been strongly advised not to stop). The Promethazine is giving me awful nightmares so even sleep isn’t relief, I often wake up already crying or so defeated by what my brain is showing me and making me feel.

I stopped smoking in October, I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t drink coffee, I barely eat for fear of losing more teeth, I am rarely (if ever) well-rested. I try my best to exercise but I’m getting a new symptom, running/walking amplifies the problems because when I’m finished I’m feeling motivated to ‘fix’ that I’m still alive. I don’t know what to do. I debate suicide every few hours, I genuinely think I’m at the end of my life. There’s nothing more I want to do, no more folks I want to see and I don’t see being able to even enjoy food (not that I can afford nutritious food anyway, I have been taking multi vitamins to combat the food poverty). My provider says there’s nothing they can do due to it being A) Christmas/NY so they’re not in the office, B) they’ve already prescribed medicine and we have a ‘plan’. 

My family are at a loss and my girlfriend checks in every few hours to make sure I’m still breathing. Our MH wards here don’t take you for ‘depression/suicidal thoughts’ (otherwise they wouldn’t have room for anyone and I understand that) so I’d need to make a pretty solid attempt on my life before being admitted, but honestly (knowing my luck) I’m terrified of failing and ending up even more disabled.

So, not sure what I want from typing this out. I’m positive this is it. I’ve got a plan and I’ve written a (non-legally binding, I’d never be able to afford a lawyer lol) note but I just don’t have the balls to go through with it; there’s not a risk right this moment, it’s not an emergency because I can’t KMS even if I wanted to lol. If I go to a+e they’ll turn me away and I’ll feel more hopeless. So I’m in relative limbo.

She was cruel to me from early childhood on. She wasn’t that way with my siblings, but she despised me. She never missed an opportunity to punish me, even if I wasn’t the culprit responsible. I’ve had one therapist call her evil. I had another essentially forbid me from reconnecting with her when I waffled about NC many years ago. 

She’s been sick for years. Heart problems among other things. It runs in her family, but she’s also brought a lot of health issues upon herself by not taking care of her health, smoking, not taking her medication, etc. 

I just got a message saying she’s dying through social media so I checked in with my sister, who is the one family member who understands why I went NC. She was still close to our mother, but that woman lived with her for a while and it nearly destroyed my sister’s marriage…so my sister gets it.

I didn’t expect to feel this emotional. I don’t wish to make a last minute visit or anything. I think that would just open up old wounds for me. I hope it’s a peaceful passing for her, and that they are keeping her comfortable. 

I grieve for that little girl who didn’t understand why her mother would force her to sit in front of her easy chair and then hit her when she got up to refill her coffee because she was “in the way”. I grieve for the little girl who learned to play behind furniture to protect herself from being hit as her mother walked by. I grieve for the little girl who was told she wasn’t wanted, that no one loved her and no one ever would. I grieve for the teenaged girl who was punched in the ear for having an ear infection because her ear infection inconvenienced her mother. I grieve for the teenaged girl who was told in front of family that she wasn’t wanted.

I’m in my early 50s, and I still struggle to understand how she could love three of her children and hate me so deeply. Logically, I understand that she was projecting, but it still hurts. I deserved a childhood where I wasn’t the scapegoat that everyone blamed for all the family’s problems. I deserved to feel safe in my own home, and I never did.

She’s never taken responsibility for how she treated me to my knowledge. I’ve been expected to “forgive and forget” by family members for years who do not seem to understand or be willing to accept the depth of the damage she caused. Forgiveness is one thing, but I will never forget. I remember every nasty word she spoke over me. I remember the physical abuse. I remember the mental torture she enjoyed causing me. Those things never leave you. You can make a measure of peace with the past, but you never truly forget.

I’m told her heart is failing. Her kidneys are shutting down, and she’s retained over 25 lbs of water in the last few days. They don’t think she has long. My sister tells me she was at peace with this possibility before she entered the hospital this last time. She was ready. She was tired of being so sick and ready to go. 

But part of me is angry that she gets a peaceful passing while I’m left with the damage she caused. It’s not fair, but then we all know deep in our souls how unfair life can be. My work is to continue to heal the damage she’s caused.

You feel it every day. The mid-afternoon energy crash that coffee barely touches. The brain fog that forces you to reread emails. The stiff joints that slow you down. The libido and performance that have quietly faded. The stubborn weight creeping on despite no real change in habits.

Most people—and most doctors—shrug and call it “normal aging.” They hand out pills to mask symptoms while the real problems deepen. But what if that story is completely wrong?

At [**Longevity Lab in Las Vegas**](https://lvlongevitylab.com), a revolutionary clinic is proving that decline isn’t inevitable. By listening to the distress signals your body has been sending for years, they’re helping men and women in their 40s, 50s, 60s—and beyond—reclaim sharp focus, boundless energy, pain-free movement, and vibrant sexual health they thought were gone forever.

# The Hidden Breakdown Traditional Medicine Misses

Your body doesn’t break overnight. It sends warnings long before disease shows up:

* **Mitochondria** slow down, starving your cells of energy → chronic fatigue and slow recovery
* **Telomeres** shorten faster under stress and inflammation → accelerated biological aging
* **Hormones** drift out of balance → mood swings, weight gain, low libido, poor sleep

Standard checkups rarely catch these until it’s too late. Longevity Lab changes that with advanced diagnostics:

* **Biological age testing** via telomeres—revealing if you’re aging faster or slower than your calendar years
* **NAD+ and mitochondrial analysis**—pinpointing the root of low energy
* **DUTCH hormone testing**—showing how your body actually processes testosterone, estrogen, and more (far beyond basic blood tests)
* **Galleri multi-cancer early detection**—screening for 50+ cancers years before symptoms
* **Full-body thermography**—spotting inflammation and risks without radiation

# Real Restoration, Not Just Symptom Management

Once they map what’s really happening inside, Longevity Lab deploys targeted, science-backed therapies:

* **NAD+ IV infusions** and light therapy to recharge cellular energy—clients report decades-younger vitality
* **Precision hormone optimization**—restoring drive, muscle, fat loss, and sexual function naturally
* **Regenerative treatments** (PRP, peptides, exosomes) for joint pain and tissue repair—avoiding surgery
* **Cognitive protocols** (methylene blue, targeted nutrients) to clear brain fog and sharpen memory
* **Non-invasive sexual wellness therapies**—enhancing performance and confidence for men and women

The results? Sharper minds, stronger bodies, pain-free movement, glowing skin, and renewed intimacy—without relying on endless medications.

# This Isn’t About Living Longer—It’s About Living Better

Longevity Lab isn’t chasing immortality. It’s about giving you the energy, clarity, and capability to crush your career, enjoy your family, travel without limits, and feel confident in your body again.

Your fatigue, fog, aches, and fading performance aren’t “just aging.” They’re fixable signals from a body asking for the right support.

The question is simple: Will you keep accepting decline as inevitable… or finally answer the wake-up call your body has been sending?

Longevity Lab in Las Vegas is ready to help you take back control. The science works. The only thing missing is your decision.

Our 8 month pup is an absolute dream. The only thing I wish we could conquer is taking her into public places without her barking if another dog enters.

She’s ok going into places if dogs are already there, but if we’re there first and another dog comes in (for example, in a cafe), she’ll bark and growl. 

It’s not the biggest issue in the world, I’m aware of that. But I’m so conscious about other people and I hate the idea of ruining someone’s peaceful morning by her barking so loudly. It can be a bit embarrassing too because everyone will naturally look at us.

Do you think this is something that will ease over time? Is she still just getting used to other dogs?

I assume it’s a protective thing. It doesn’t seem like a playful “omg let me go and say hi!” behaviour. More like a “back away from my owner” bark / growl.

She does settle back down eventually but I can’t relax while having a coffee in a cafe because I’m so on edge about another dog entering 😅

When I check the rooms, the beds look like someone just got up seconds before...","I took the night watch job because it paid better than anything else I could find on short notice.

No customers. No coworkers. No real responsibilities beyond staying awake and logging hourly patrols. After my last contract fell through, I needed something stable fast. Rent was due. Savings were thin. This place didn’t ask many questions, and I didn’t ask any back.

The rehabilitation center used to handle long-term patients. Stroke recovery. Traumatic injuries. Neurological cases that needed months, sometimes years, of care. But funding dried up. The center shut down in phases, wing by wing, until only the administration offices and storage remained active.

The patients were gone.

That was emphasized during training.

Every room cleared. Every system powered down. Broken wiring left as-is because there was no reason to fix it. My job was just to watch the building overnight and call security if something obvious went wrong.

I work alone. Midnight to six. That matters.

The first few nights were boring in the way you hope a night watch job will be. Fluorescent lights buzzing. The smell of antiseptic that never fully leaves places like this. My footsteps echoing down long, empty halls.

I have insomnia. Always have. I don’t fall asleep easily, and when I do, it’s light and broken. Night work suits me. Or at least it did before this place started acting… occupied.

The call lights turned on during my fourth shift.

I was sitting at the front desk filling out the logbook when a soft chime sounded overhead.

Once.

Then again.

I froze with my pen halfway down the page.

Patient call lights have a very specific sound. It’s designed to be noticeable without being jarring. I’d heard it plenty of times in hospitals visiting relatives. You don’t forget it.

The panel behind the desk lit up.

ROOM 214 – CALL ACTIVE

That room is in the east wing.

The sealed wing.

I stared at the panel, waiting for it to shut off. Old wiring does weird things. Power surges. False positives. That’s what I told myself.

The light stayed on.

I grabbed the radio and did what I was trained to do. “Control, this is night watch. I’ve got a call light active in the east wing.”

Static. Then a bored voice. “East wing’s offline.”

“I know,” I said. “But the panel’s showing an active call.”

Pause.

“Probably residual current,” they said. “Log it and reset if you want.”

Reset meant physically checking the room.

I didn’t like that part, but it was in the job description. I took the flashlight and headed down the hall.

The east wing always feels colder than the rest of the building. Not dramatically so. Just enough that you notice when you cross the threshold. The lights are dimmer too. Half of them burned out and were never replaced.

Room 214 was at the far end.

The door was unlocked.

That was the first small thing that felt wrong. I’m sure I locked it during my first patrol. All sealed rooms were supposed to stay locked.

Inside, the room smelled faintly warm. Not stale. Not dusty.

Lived-in.

The bed sheets were rumpled. The pillow was indented. The blanket was folded back like someone had just swung their legs over the side and stood up.

The call button on the rail was dark.

No light.

No active signal.

I stood there longer than I meant to, staring at the bed, trying to convince myself there was a normal explanation. Maybe maintenance forgot to straighten the room after final discharge. Maybe the indentations never fully smoothed out.

Then I noticed the chair.

It had been pulled away from the wall.

Not far. Just enough to sit.

I reset the panel manually and left.

The light didn’t come back on that night.

The next night, it was Room 221.

Same wing. Different hallway.

Same chime. Same soft glow on the panel.

Same warm smell.

Same bed that looked recently vacated.

This time, there was a cup of water on the bedside table. Half full. No dust. No film on the surface.

The wiring in that room was visibly damaged. Exposed conduits. Cut lines. There should have been no power to the call button at all.

I logged it. Reset it. Told myself someone was messing with me.

By the end of the week, the pattern was clear.

The lights only came on between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m.

Never more than one at a time.

Always in the sealed wing.

Always in a room that looked like the patient had just stood up seconds before I arrived.

And always, without fail, the bed was still warm.

Last night, it happened again.

Room 203.

The chime sounded while I was halfway through my coffee. My stomach dropped before I even saw the panel.

I didn’t call it in this time.

I just went.

The door was already open.

The room was darker than the others. The overhead light wouldn’t turn on. My flashlight beam swept across the bed.

The sheets were pulled tight.

No indentations.

No warmth.

I felt a strange sense of relief.

Then the call light turned on.

Not on the panel.

On the bed rail.

Right next to my hand.

The chime sounded again, louder this time.

From inside the room.

Behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

Every instinct screamed to, but something colder and quieter told me not to. The chime kept repeating behind me, soft and patient, like it had all the time in the world.

I stared at the bed instead.

The sheets were still tight. Hospital corners sharp enough to cut paper. No warmth. No sign anyone had been there.

Then the mattress dipped.

Not suddenly. Not violently. Just a slow, careful depression near the edge, like someone easing themselves down, mindful of bad joints or old injuries.

The bed rail creaked.

The call light went dark.

The room fell silent.

I backed out without taking my eyes off the bed. My heel caught the threshold and I almost went down, heart slamming hard enough to make me dizzy. I didn’t breathe until I was back in the hallway, door shut between me and whatever had just sat down.

I logged it as a malfunction.

That was the lie I told the system. It was the only one it would accept.

The rest of the shift passed without incident, but the building felt different after that. Less empty. Like I’d been mistaken before and was only now noticing the truth.

In the morning, I asked the day supervisor about the east wing.

He didn’t look surprised. That scared me more than if he had.

“They were long-term,” he said, shrugging. “Some of them didn’t want to leave.”

“That’s not how discharge works,” I said.

He met my eyes for a second too long. “Some bodies leave before the habits do.”

I asked him about the wiring. About how the call lights could still function.

“They shouldn’t,” he said. “Which is why you don’t reset them manually anymore.”

That wasn’t in my training.

That night, the call lights started earlier.

1:47 a.m.

Room 210.

The panel lit up while I was mid-patrol, right in front of me, like it wanted to be seen. I stood there staring at it, waiting for the surge of dread to crest and break.

It didn’t.

It just settled in, heavy and constant.

I didn’t go right away. I watched the panel instead. After a few minutes, another light flickered on.

ROOM 211 – CALL ACTIVE

Then another.

ROOM 212

They weren’t random.

They were sequential.

Down the hall.

Toward the nurses’ station.

Toward me.

I called it in. Control didn’t answer.

The radio crackled once, then went dead.

The hallway lights dimmed, just a notch. Not enough to trigger emergency systems. Enough to notice.

I heard movement before I saw anything.

Beds don’t roll silently, even when they’re empty. There’s always a rattle, a squeak, a scuff against tile.

These were quiet.

Controlled.

The first bed emerged from Room 210.

No patient. No restraints. Just a neatly made bed rolling into the hallway, stopping under its own power.

Then another.

And another.

They lined up along the wall, call lights blinking softly, one after another, like they were waiting their turn.

I stood frozen at the far end of the corridor, flashlight useless in my shaking hand.

One bed moved again.

The sheets shifted.

A depression formed slowly in the mattress, shoulders first, then hips, then legs.

I heard breathing.

Shallow. Labored. Familiar.

A voice came from somewhere close. Too close.

“Nurse?” it whispered.

I don’t work medical. I never have.

But my mouth answered anyway.

“Yes.”

All the call lights went solid at once.

And behind me, I felt the unmistakable pressure of a hand taking my wrist, guiding it gently downward.

Toward a call button I hadn’t noticed blinking on my own sleeve.

The button on my sleeve was warm.

That detail stuck with me more than anything else. Not the beds moving on their own. Not the voices. The warmth. Like it had been pressed over and over again by hands that no longer felt pain the way they should.

I ripped my arm free and stumbled backward. The pressure vanished instantly, like it had never been there.

The hallway was full now.

Beds lined both sides, perfectly spaced. Sheets tight. Pillows fluffed. Every call light glowing a steady, expectant yellow. The air smelled thicker, heavier. Not rot. Not decay. Something clinical. Antiseptic layered over old sweat and fear.

“Nurse,” the voice said again. It came from multiple directions this time. Same word. Same tone. Slightly out of sync.

I backed away toward the nurses’ station. My heel hit something solid.

Another bed.

I hadn’t seen it move.

The mattress dipped behind me. The sound was unmistakable. Weight settling. Springs adjusting.

I ran.

I don’t remember choosing a direction. I just moved, sprinting down the hall, past rooms that should have been empty. Doors stood open now. Inside, every bed looked occupied in the same subtle way. Sheets pulled back. Indentations where bodies rested. IV poles standing at attention, bags swaying gently though there was no airflow.

Call buttons blinked from every rail.

I reached the nurses’ station and slammed the door behind me. Locked it. Threw my weight against it until the frame rattled.

The panel lit up like a Christmas tree.

Every room in the east wing was calling.

The chime didn’t sound in bursts anymore. It blended together into one continuous tone that set my teeth on edge. I clamped my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help. The sound wasn’t coming from the speakers.

It was coming from the walls.

I slid down behind the desk, breathing hard, trying to think. The training manual sat open where I’d left it earlier. Pages curled. Margins full of notes from people who no longer worked here.

One line caught my eye.

In the event of system failure, do not acknowledge patient requests without medical staff present.

I laughed. A short, broken sound.

I wasn’t medical staff. I wasn’t supposed to be here at all.

The chime cut out abruptly.

The silence that followed felt worse.

Then the radio crackled.

“Night watch,” Control said, voice distorted. “Status check.”

I grabbed the radio like it was a lifeline. “You need to get someone here. Now. The east wing—”

“Are active,” Control finished for me. “Yes. We know.”

My stomach dropped. “You know?”

A pause. Static hissed softly.

“They respond better if someone’s on site,” Control said. “Keeps them calm.”

“Respond to what?” I asked.

The answer came slowly, carefully.

“Routine.”

The door to the station creaked.

I looked up.

It was opening from the inside.

I hadn’t unlocked it.

The beds rolled closer, slow and orderly, stopping just outside the doorway. The call lights blinked in unison, like a heartbeat.

A hand reached around the doorframe. Pale. Clean. Fingernails trimmed short.

Another followed.

A figure leaned in, careful not to bump the frame.

They wore a hospital gown. Tied neatly. Patient bracelet still on their wrist. The name had been rubbed away from use.

Their eyes focused on me with practiced patience.

“You’re late,” they said.

Behind them, more shapes rose from the beds. Not fully. Just enough to look at me.

The radio slipped from my hand.

Control spoke one last time before the line went dead.

“Please,” they said. “Just answer the calls.”

The lights in the station flickered.

Every call button went dark.

And for the first time since I took this job, I realized the truth.

The patients weren’t calling for help.

They were checking to see who was still on duty.

I don’t remember standing up.

One moment I was crouched behind the desk, lungs burning, eyes locked on the doorway. The next, I was on my feet, smoothing the front of my jacket like I was reporting for a shift I’d worked a thousand times before.

The figure in the gown watched me with quiet approval.

“That’s better,” they said.

The beds rolled back as one, clearing a path down the hall. The call lights stayed dark, but I could feel them. Waiting. Charged. Ready.

I shook my head. “I’m not supposed to do this.”

They smiled gently. Not kindly. Reassuring in the way people are when they believe resistance is just confusion.

“No one ever is,” they said. “You’ll learn.”

They turned and walked away. The others followed, slow and careful, beds gliding behind them like obedient animals. One by one, they returned to their rooms. Sheets lifted. Mattresses dipped. Pillows cradled heads that didn’t need sleep anymore.

The wing settled.

The building exhaled.

I stayed there until morning.

When the day staff arrived, they barely looked at me. I stood behind the desk while they chatted about coffee and schedules. No one mentioned the east wing. No one checked the logs.

I handed in my badge at the end of the shift. Told them I was done.

The supervisor nodded. “You stayed the whole night?”

“Yes,” I said.

“Good,” he replied. “That’s important.”

I didn’t go back the next night.

Or the night after that.

I found another job. Different hours. Different building. I told myself it was over.

It wasn’t.

The call light chime followed me.

Not audibly. Not at first. Just a sense of expectation. Of being needed. Of someone waiting patiently for me to respond.

Two nights ago, I woke up at 2:11 a.m. sharp.

I wasn’t in bed.

I was standing in my kitchen, hand resting on the wall at exactly the height a call button would be.

There was a faint yellow glow on my skin.

My phone buzzed.

No number. No notification header.

Just one line of text.

ROOM READY. STAFF REQUIRED.

I didn’t answer it.

At 2:14, I felt it anyway.

That familiar warmth under my fingertips.

A gentle pressure, guiding my hand down.

Pressing.

And somewhere far away, in a building I promised myself I’d never return to, a call light turned on.

Just one.

Patient waiting.

I usually leave it there when I forget to bring it home.

When I went to grab it at lunch, I noticed someone had used it and left it dirty, with a little chip on the rim. I felt my stomach drop. This mug isn’t just a cup; it’s personal, it has memories, and I really didn’t expect anyone to treat it like that.

I asked around, but nobody admitted to it, and no one saw anything. I was so frustrated that I ended up saying loudly that whoever did it was a “worthless piece of shit.” My manager overheard and didn’t appreciate the outburst.

Later, I started thinking… maybe I overreacted. On one hand, it was my mug and I had every right to be upset. On the other hand, yelling at people in the office probably wasn’t the smartest move.

A: I was right to call out the person. It’s my stuff, and standing up for myself felt justified.

# 2 – An Hour

The man’s posture had changed.  He stood stock still, almost unmoving—the phone pressed to his ear, the card still in his hand, hanging loosely by his side.  The recorded human voice returned, but briefly.  “Press nine to skip ahead,” it said. “Press seven to go back. Press zero to return to the previous menu.”

A moment later a harsh and unpleasant alert tone played, like a high-pitched car horn. It only lasted a second before the mechanical voice returned.

“This message was issued at two-zero-one-nine zulu.  It supersedes no prior messages unless otherwise stated.”

A pause.

“At one-nine-five-four zulu, Bright Hill announced a general alert and mobilization in response to the phenomenon coded as two-eight dash zero-one-eight-one. This phenomenon has received initial classification as an extreme cognitohazard with lethal effects.”

Despite this, the man looked out the window, the phone still held to his ear.  It had been an early spring and the trees around the house were thick, lush, and a peaceful deep green.  It was muggy and partly cloudy, threatening rain.  The grass of the front lawn was still acceptably short for now, but the warm and wet spring had seen him out there mowing almost every weekend.  This would have been a good day for it, he thought, save for the threat of rain.

As if suddenly remembering what he’d just heard on the phone, he looked away from the windows.

The artificial voice continued, no doubt reading some script someone had written, probably in one of the big centralized facilities somewhere remote.  “Data indicate with high confidence that phenomenon two-eight dash zero-one-eight-one was initially observed in or around Norilsk, Russian Federation, on or about Thursday, May eighteen.  Analysis suggests the phenomenon manifested as scattered, localized effects that remained uncorroborated.  Superficially similar effects were later observed in…Novy Urengoy…Yakutsk…Kazan.  Beginning Wednesday, May twenty-four, data volume allowed for corroboration and correlation of unnatural death reports and related incident reports.”

The man was staring down at his desk, which contained a laptop computer, a pad of sticky notes, a pen, and nothing else.  He wasn’t looking at anything in particular.  *They haven’t called a GAM in…four or five years*, he thought, but he already knew that’s what it was going to be just from the alert tone at the beginning.  An unambiguous announcement that *you are not going to like this*.

The mechanical voice continued on in the same steady but synthetic cadence.  “Beginning approximately one-four-one-five zulu on Sunday, May twenty-eight, the phenomenon manifested simultaneously in…Moscow…Lviv…Seoul…Chongqing…Jaipur.  Data and report volume expanded geometrically beginning approximately one-four-four-zero zulu.  By one-five-one-five zulu the phenomenon had manifested in approximately four hundred fifty major population centers across most inhabited areas, with the exception of South Africa and southernmost South America.”

*An hour*, the man thought.  *It took an hour for the world to end*.  *If this* ***was*** *the end of the world.*  He was the cynical type, after all.  He supposed he’d find out in a few minutes.

The voice didn’t pause on account of his inner monologue.

“Based on analysis, lethal effects remained localized to small clusters until approximately one-six-zero-zero zulu, at which time reports of significant psycho-physiological effects increased exponentially.  Data indicate systemic institutional collapse began in major population centers beginning approximately one-eight-five-zero zulu, centered simultaneously on…Moscow…Seoul…Osaka…Tel Aviv…Athens.”

There was a short pause before the next section of the brief.  “Phenomenon two-eight dash zero-one-eight-one is observed causing severe, rapid-acting incapacitating or lethal effects in humans and certain categories of intelligent animals or wildlife.  Harmful effects are believed to be delivered through multimodal perceptive vectors, which may be, say again, may be limited to direct observation.”

The automated voice continued.  “All personnel regardless of operational tier are advised to use extreme caution at all times.  Within operational parameters, avoid locations with unobstructed views such as through windows or open doors.  Avoid exposure to uncontrolled environments.  Avoid contact with civilians.  Within operational parameters do not, say again, do not approach or initiate intentional exposure to the phenomenon under any circumstances.”

By now he was fairly certain this was, in fact, the end of the world.  *“Institutional collapse in major population centers”* is not a phrase used lightly.  No more baseball—he suddenly and randomly wondered what he’d see if he’d been watching a live game, and not a condensed version.  Nothing good, he imagined.

*“Rapid-acting incapacitating effects,”* which *“may be limited to direct observation,”* he thought, mulling over the implications of that.  In the back of his mind he knew such things existed, but they were abstracts, things he knew *of* but not something he’d ever had to deal with himself.

His thoughts were interrupted by the mechanical voice resuming.  “Mobilization, deployment, and operational instructions follow,” it said before pausing.

“Adam Three…assume Bachelor earliest opportunity, stance red, Jester is authorized.”

The man stiffened, somehow pressing the phone harder against his ear.  He was about to find out how he was going to spend the apocalypse.

“Boy Two…assume Clean House earliest opportunity, stance yellow, expect contact per last standing order.”

He moved with a purpose, not rushed but motivated.  There was a cardboard file box next to the modest wooden desk, empty and without a lid.  He put the phone on speaker, turned the volume up, and tucked it in his pocket as he exited the study.

The voice was muffled, but audible.  He caught some of it, but the rest of the tiers weren’t wholly relevant to him anyway, not in a way that took priority over his current task.

“…Three…assume Dark House earliest… … …Watchtower in effect… … …rescinded.”

The box under his arm, he went to the refrigerator.  The cracked tile under his foot clicked as it shifted against its grout, a background noise he only rarely noticed.  Mayonnaise, check, into the box it went.  Hot sauce, because he liked this one and not the one downstairs.  Into the box, check.

Coffee creamer, the open one, carefully into the box so as not to spill it.  Check.  He eyed the box with half a pizza in it, hesitated, and then awkwardly balanced it on its side inside the file box.  He shut the fridge.

“…Stargazer… … …yellow, data triage and... … …in accordance with last…”

Phone charger, the good one plugged in by the coffee maker, check.  The roll of paper towels, because the ones downstairs were cheap.  Into the box, check.  His favorite coffee mug, check.  Earpods.  Check.

“…Four… additional… … …contact your… … …yellow with CONUS restrictions, say...”

He didn’t let it distract him, but he quietly took note that most of the tiers were authorized yellow rules of engagement.  He filed that away as soon as he’d thought of it.

He methodically shut off the lights on the first floor, of which only a couple were on.  He went to the back door off of the kitchen, and threw the two substantial-looking deadbolts—one at the top corner and one at the bottom corner.  The front door was already double-bolted, as was the door to the garage.  Lastly, he flipped the single light switch on the kitchen wall, the one that looked out of place by itself and seemed to do nothing.",1,1766766391.0,redditserials,1,1.0,False

Our criteria has certainly been seen before 😅 proximity to outdoor activities (climbing mostly), some local culture, houses under one million","Hi! My husband and I want to move to California from Colorado. For me, this would be moving back- I grew up in Salinas and went to college in Santa Cruz. Husband is from Midwest. 

We’ve been in Boulder, CO for six+ years. Combined income is 250k. Criteria: 

\- close to outdoor activities. More specifically climbing, even more specifically bouldering. Willing to drive a bit for this (ex. 4 hours from Yosemite means easy weekend trips. It doesn’t need to be on our doorstep, though that’d be a bonus) 

\- northern CA (close to family, and our preference)

\- Some level of local culture: coffee shops, local businesses, live music, farmers market etc. We don’t mind driving a few minutes for this- growing up outside Salinas, any coffee shop or restaurant was 15+ minutes of driving. Again, it’d be a huge bonus if it was slightly more accessible but we don’t mind a little inconvenience here. 

\- other people who live there in their late 20s / early 30s 

\- and of course the kicker: houses under $1 million, we’d love to buy a house soonish and though we make plenty of money we are just starting to save after paying off student loans and getting traveling in before settling down. 

I guess I’m really curious about suburbs or small neighboring towns to larger towns/cities. For example: I would love to live in Santa Cruz again but I also know we currently can’t afford to buy in Santa Cruz proper. So I’ve started looking into the towns around Santa Cruz. 

We’re coming up with a shortlist of places to visit and spend some time in- what should be on the list? ",6,1766766389.0,SameGrassButGreener,29,0.67,False
