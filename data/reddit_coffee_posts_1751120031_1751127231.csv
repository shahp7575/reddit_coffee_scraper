1lmqhkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Flaky_Emotion_8084/comments/1lmqhkr/i_am_a_priest_in_newfoundland_the_days_are/,"I am a priest in Newfoundland, the days are growing darker Part 1","It would be a lie to say I grew up wanting to be a priest. My father would take my sisters and me to church every Sunday, whether it was snowing or blisteringly hot, we always went. While my sisters were off finding their husbands, I was growing in the faith and spent more time praying than socializing. However, I was still hesitant when my father told me I should attend a seminary school after graduation. It was not exactly the most thrilling prospect as a seventeen-year-old kid, but after some thought that summer, I decided to give it a shot. It would be the best and worst decision of my life.



Once I was fully ordained, I was dispatched to a corner of the globe that had drifted away from the church. Where I ended up was a town on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland called Blythe. It was a small, isolated fishing town whose main claim to fame was the rumored existence of a nearby Viking landing site. I knew it was my calling when I learned that it had previously been host to a catholic church. However, after it burned down in the early 1800s with the priest inside, there was never any attempt to rebuild it.



On my first visit to Blythe, I found the remains of the old church buried deep in the woods outside of town. There was barely anything left besides the cellar and some large logs still blackened by flames. It would be easy to clear the rubble and build my new church atop where the old one once stood. Luckily I was given sufficient funds by the Vatican for this undertaking. 



The locals were leery of me initially since not many outsiders came through their neck of the woods. On this first visit, I tried my best to introduce myself to as many people as possible, but sadly, my trip ended before I could make any real progress. I did, however, pay a group of workers to begin constructing the new church before I left. 



On my second trip, the locals were more receptive to my presence. Several people approached me, asking about the church, faith, and me personally. Frankly, I wasn’t expecting this kind of reception after my last visit, but there was one encounter that stood out. 



I was visiting the construction site. The sun was getting low and the workers were packing up for the day. Most of the framing had been done and I took great pleasure walking through the hollow interior imagining what it would look like finished. That was when one of the workers approached me.	



“Excuse me, Father?” He asked, taking off his hard hat.



“Yes?”



I would come to find out his name was Johnathan Heathstead. He stood there and scratched his head like he wasn’t sure what to say next.



“Do you…Do you believe in demons?” He asked.



“Yes, I sure do.”



“But do you *believe* in them?”



“I…I don’t know what you’re asking,” I said.



Johnathan paused for a long second before speaking.



“Never mind.”



At the time, I didn’t think too much about this interaction. Looking back I should have. 



With my third visit, I brought two suitcases and my cat Spots. I was finally moving to Blythe. The church was finished, at least as finished as a church in the backcountry could be. I was proud of it. In fact, I was so excited that I opened the doors to all visitors that first day. I was already greeting nearly two dozen people before I even had a chance to unpack. While that might not seem like many, every pew was filled in that small church.



There was one man, however, who wasn’t sitting. He was standing in the back watching me as I gave my little sermon and invited the crowd to attend that Sunday’s mass. After everyone filed out, he approached me.



It was Johnathan. I could hardly recognize him. He looked tired, with dark bags under his eyes and a long, disheveled beard. His clothes looked two sizes too big and it took me a moment to recognize they were the same clothes he was wearing the day I had met him. 



“Father,” He croaked, his voice harsh and dry, “Do you have a moment?”



I paused, unsure how to react.



“I need help,” he said with tears welling in his eyes.



While I was ready to listen to him talk about losing a loved one or going through a nasty divorce, I wasn’t ready for what he ended up saying. I ushered him to the first row of pews and we sat for a few minutes before he started talking.



“Father…Do you believe in the Devil?” He asked.



“Yes of course.”



“Do you believe he walks among us?”



“Sadly I do. He exists in the hearts of men everywhere.”



Johnathan paused, more tears spilling down his cheeks. I became acutely aware of the smell of fresh lumber at that moment. Strange what you notice in the silence between words.



“I believe the Devil has his grip on me,” he whispered.



“What makes you think that, my child?”



Johnathan took a long, steadying breath before he spoke again.



“I don’t know why, but I’ve started to…do things.”



“What things?” I pressed.



“I…I black out sometimes. Sometimes only for a few minutes, but other times for whole days. When I wake up…When I wake I…Sometimes I come to and I’m waist-deep in the ocean on the brink of the abyss. Others…others I am bare-chested and covered in b-blood. Normally I am outside, on a rock, or up a tree. But, sometimes I am in the basement of my house scribbling like a madman with chalk and blood.”	



“Whose blood is it?”	



“I-I-I don’t know. Sometimes I swear it is fish blood, others I am not too sure. Our dog went missing a few weeks ago…I don’t know.”



Johnathan broke down. Sobbing into his hands. I noticed they were slightly stained red. 



“Father, I need help. Please!”



Now, the Church has had controversy with mental illnesses being conflated with possession, so to say I wasn’t exactly reaching for my cross and Bible over what this man was telling me would be an understatement.   


“Let me consult with my superiors,” I said, patting him on the back, “they will surely know what the best course of action is.”



“Father, I need help now!”



“Yes I know, but I am limited in what I can do right now.”



Johnathan’s face immediately sobered up and a flash of rage shined in his eyes. Tears still rolled down his cheeks as he stood up and stormed out of the church. 



“Go in peace!” I called out after him, “God protects all of his children and gives us strength!”



Johnathan paused halfway through the door and turned back to me.



“Then I am no child of God,” He said before slamming the door shut.



I sat in the empty church for a while, considering what had just happened. My welcome to the town had gone smoothly so far but I was afraid, after how that confession went, that I might not be up to the task. Spots jumped up on my lap and started purring. It put me at ease and the rest of the evening went smoothly.



I had no way of knowing that that night, Johnathan would enter his basement and never emerge again. 



It was a closed-casket funeral. A small, intimate affair even though I am sure half the town showed up. It was there that I met Marie, Johnathan’s widow. A few days after the funeral, I decided to stop by the new widow’s home. I didn’t feel it was appropriate to crowd around her at the funeral or to simply ignore her. My motivation wasn’t entirely altruistic, a selfish part of me wished to wash my hands of the guilt that had weighed on me since I got the news. 



When Marie answered the door, it was obvious she’d been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy and her nose was almost rubbed raw.



“Good evening Father, what can I do for you?” She asked.



“I just wanted to stop by and offer my condolences,” I said.



She opened her mouth and closed it several times.



“Would you like to come in?” She said, biting back tears, “I would appreciate some guidance.”



Marie led me inside to a small, two-person dining table in the kitchen. 



“Coffee?” She asked.



“That would be great.”



Her hands were shaking as she grabbed two mugs from the cupboard. 



“Father,” she started, “do you believe in demons?”



Now, I like to believe I am a rational man, but I would be lying if I said that question didn’t immediately make me feel sick to my stomach.



“Yes, of course.”



“Can they make a sane man do what Johnny did?” She asked, placing the mug of old coffee in front of me before sinking into the opposite chair.



“What did Johnathan do?”



“I-I don’t know. He told me he was having nightmares but I didn’t think they were all that serious. I mean who would? What was I supposed to do?”



“My child,” I placed my hand on her wrist, “what did Johnathan do?”



Marie wiped at her nose and looked at the basement door.



“He came home late and he was sweating like crazy. I got him water and he seemed to settle down. We went to bed and…and…” she broke down but quickly composed herself, “I found him down there that morning. The sheriff took his body and some photos but it was clear it was self-inflicted. The door was locked from the inside. He told me I get to be the one to clean it up but I haven’t opened that door since that morning.”	



“I’m sorry.”



“Why, Father, why did this happen?”



“I don’t know.”



“What should I do?”	



“I…I don’t know,” I sheepishly said.



Marie stood up and walked over to the window.



“You haven’t touched the basement?” I asked.



“No. No, not yet.”



“Let me help, it’s the least I can do.”



Marie led me to the basement door. She didn’t open it, only nodding towards the doorknob before shuffling back to the dining table. 



The door whined as it swung open revealing nothing but a curtain of darkness just past the threshold. A distinct metal tinge hung in the air and stuck on my tongue. I rolled up my sleeves and whispered a quick prayer. Each step creaked as I descended into the darkness. I didn’t know what to expect but it wasn’t what was down there. 



I pulled on the light cord. It was an unfinished basement with low beam ceilings and concrete floors, a desk was pushed to the side with a rug rolled up and stored on top. It made a clearing in the middle of the basement. 



It was red—red everywhere—streaks and drops, smears across the floors and on the walls. A tinge of rusting iron hung in the air. Among the streaks, there were broken fingernails and scraps of skin. It made me feel weak.



At first, there was no pattern to the madness. Just intersecting lines and circles, hard angles, and jagged scribbling. My head was spinning and I stumbled back to the stairs. I sat for a while, staring at the self-inflicted carnage when it finally started to form.



It was a single, massive rune, or at least something like a rune. It was surprisingly intricate, with large smears making up the border with smaller drops and streaks for finer details. I took several pictures of the rune from every possible angle. I didn’t know what I would do but I still felt I should document it. It took a few hours to clean up the blood. Even after cleaning, the floor was still stained red. 



“God be with you,” I said standing on the house's front step, “it always gets better with time.”



Marie didn’t say anything as she slowly closed the door. 



Several months passed and I had settled into a routine. The buzz around the new church had died down and there was regular attendance during mass. While it wasn’t the most exciting place to be, Blythe and the surrounding countryside had started to grow on me. With the coming of fall and the changing of leaves, I found myself outside more and more. 



The forests behind the church could have well been endless. The locals had carved hiking paths through the trees and several fallen logs made excellent benches. I hadn’t seen or heard anything about Marie since I visited her house that night. Rumor was that she had secluded herself and was living as a hermit, barely leaving her house. Who could blame her?



Since that night, I haven’t looked at the photos I took. There was no need to; they were seared into my memory. I thought about that night regularly on my walks through the woods. There was one tree that was my turning point for my walks. Rumor has it that it was a lone survivor of the region's old-growth forest. I say this as a man of God; I understand why ancient peoples believed these great things to be gods themselves.



It was after one of these hikes that I found a note folded up and slid under the door. It was written in handwriting so heavy it pierced the page a few times. It simply read: 



*Help.*



While it was a bit of a stretch, I presumed the note was from Marie. After all, who else would it have been from? She just needed help after Johnathan passed away. Oh how wrong I was. It was getting late but I made the trek out to her house that night. The house sat on the outskirts of town overlooking the ocean. 



Once I reached the front door, the sun had already set and the insects had started singing their tunes. I was about to knock when I realized the door was already open.



“Mrs. Heathstead?” I called out.



Nothing but the darkness of the house answered. The door let out a low creak as I pushed it open.



“Mrs. Heathstead? Are you here?”	No response.	



I stepped inside, the floorboards moaning under my feet. 



“Mrs Heathstead are you there?” 



I was about to turn back when I heard a faint sobbing coming from the basement. The basement door was slightly ajar, inky darkness on the other side. I took a step closer. The sobbing suddenly stopped. 



I heard whispering coming from the basement.



“What did you say? Mrs. Heathstead?”



The voice that responded was raspy and almost indiscernibly quiet.



“There’s a man at the top of the stairs.”



I took a step closer, my heart pumping in my ears as the voice spoke again.



“And another in the basement.”



Screaming echoed from the basement. The inky darkness was dispelled as orange flames burst from the basement. I fell back, barely avoiding a burst of flames that licked at the place I was just standing. Scrambling to my feet, I barely got out of the doorway before the door slammed shut. By what force I don’t know.



It was only for the briefest of moments, but for a second I thought something was staring at me from the window. As I blinked the windows exploded in flames sending shards of glass flying in every direction.



The Heathstead house burned down in less than 5 minutes. It took nearly double that for the first men carrying hoses to respond. I stared at the flames, my clothes and hair singed.  The flames swirled and licked the night sky.



The Sheriff seemed just as confused and disturbed as I was when I gave my statement. Whether this was because he believed me or didn’t, I don’t know. I was still an outsider after all. A couple died so soon after I arrived. Even the most trusting man would be suspicious.



It was eventually ruled as self-inflicted. It is easier to believe that a grief-stricken widow would choose to end her pain than for it to be the work of the devil.



I don’t know what I saw in that window. If I saw anything in that window. I like to believe I am a reasonable man as much as I am a holy one. But after that night, I find myself struggling for answers.



All I know is the devil is real, and I fear he is here in Newfoundland.

1lmqh84,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lmqh84/once_she_dreamed_by_abbi_glines/,Once She Dreamed by Abbi Glines:,"Chapter One  
  
  My dreams were full of fairytales. Traveling the world, going to fancy parties, and even outrageous closets full of clothes. When I opened my eyes I felt ashamed of myself even though I couldn’t exactly control my dreams. It still felt wrong to be so wrapped up in the things Hale could give me.  
  
  I liked him as a person. To me he was more than his money.  
  
  But would you like him if he lived in Moulton?  
  
  That was momma’s voice in my head. Bringing me back to reality. The truth was, a part of me was superficial. I wasn’t in love with Hale. I was fascinated with him because of the life he lived.  
  
  This was a part of my journey. It wasn’t like I was marrying the man. I was working for him, and although he said he wanted more, and score one for momma because she’d just said that to me, I wasn’t sure what more would be. Could I fall in love? Would it be easy because of all he could give me?  
  
  You were raised better than that. Momma’s voice again. Ricocheting around in my head.  
  
  While trying to clear my thoughts I finished making up the bed and dressing. Momma’s voice finally left. Images of Hale did not. It was just after sunrise and although Felicity’s note said Hale would awaken at eight ready for breakfast on the balcony with the morning paper, I wanted to have a head start making everything perfect. Plus, I really needed my own bite of breakfast and some coffee. I studied myself in the mirror. The new wardrobe that arrived last night had been surprising. Everything felt different. The fabric even smelled fancy.  
  
  Figuring out what I was supposed to wear everyday was confusing. The two really extravagant dresses hanging in my closet were the most mind boggling of all. Where would I wear those? Last night I’d slipped on the shoes that matched them and lapped the room a couple of times. They gave me the silly feeling of playing dress up. Like I was a child or something.  
  
  He’d even had panties and bras delivered. I wasn’t sure why it mattered what I was wearing under my clothes. I figured no one saw that and my undies were just fine. But these felt nice. Satin and silk. Putting them on made me feel like a princess. After changing three times I decided that the black linen shorts and delicate looking sleeveless blouse were good enough for casual. Though they didn’t feel casual in the least. The price tags were gone, but I had a feeling that clothing arriving without a price tag was too shocking for the average person to comprehend.  
  
  Cooking breakfast in this was going to make me nervous. He’d said not to unpack my bags, meaning he didn’t want to see me in any of my own clothes. Hale wanted me dressed in what he had purchased and I would do what he said. I tried not to focus on the cost of my outfit. I pulled my hair back into a loose low braid and proceeded.  
  
  The penthouse was quiet. Just the light muffled sound of the busy city came through the windows. I went to the glass doors in the living room and stepped outside to take in the view. I needed reminding I was here. Everyday I would need reminding. I was afraid I would suddenly wake and this would all be a dream. I’d be back in Moulton at the bakery. Something I did not want. The part of my life that kept me in Moulton was over and done with forever. I hugged myself and smiled as I studied the city below me, bustling and colorful and pulsing, people hurrying about in their business attire, while others carried shopping bags. The tourists were obvious with their cameras and phones snapping photos for friends back home.  
  
  Soon I would be a part of that world. Hale would take me to parties and lunches. I would walk the streets in my expensive clothing just like I lived in a movie, one continuously playing for me. My smile grew as I imagined what life with Hale was going to be like in the future. Would he take me to his other homes? Would I travel with him on his plane? I had no idea what surprises were in store for Sammy Jo Knox from Moulton.  
  
  I wanted to see so much. Do and experience it all. New York City could never be uncovered, because there was so much inside it to reveal. And I wanted to peel it back. As much as I thought I could. That wasn’t greed, now was it? Was my ambition blind to that? Was my desire to live my dream and its fancies arrogant self-absorption? These questions pinged in my head.  
  
  Turning around I went back inside and headed for the kitchen to cook. My stomach was rumbling loudly. I needed food to think about this. I knew if I called and asked momma, she would tell me “yes, you’re being greedy.” But then, of course, I could tell myself that momma didn’t understand things. She saw them differently because of the way she had lived, which wasn’t the life I desired. I was a dreamer. I chased after my dreams. I wanted so much more and I wouldn’t feel bad about going after my goals. If I hadn’t wanted more I would’ve missed this opportunity by being married to a guy in Moulton, when Hale stopped by the bakery. Things align and have a reason. That, I believe in my heart.  
  
  Knowing there was something bigger, a thing barely at the tips of my fingers, has kept me going since I was little. I loved the fantasies I created in my head. They were escapes from the reality I was born in, its hard edges and sharp nasty points, pricking my dreams everyday.  
  
  Now, here I was, living fantasies. I wanted to think that daddy was in heaven smiling down on what I was doing. He knew what I wanted to do. Not once had he told me I shouldn’t.  
  
  I also wanted this life for my sisters. Even if they didn’t for themselves. I knew if I could show them there were other options outside of Moulton, Alabama, they’d soon see things different. Momma was Moulton. I understood that. But I wanted to give her more. Less worries about money and the bakery. I would send cash home to make that happen, as soon as I got ahead.  
  
  Hale brought me here to change me. A part of me wanted that. To belong to the life he lived. But I was scared of what it all meant. This was going to be a huge leap. I had come and would somehow survive.  
  
  **Chapter Two**  
  
  I heard his voice before I saw him. He was on his phone as he walked down the hallway from his room past the kitchen. I could tell from his tone it was business. He was annoyed and irritable and gesturing.  
  
  Moving quickly I finished up his breakfast. He wanted two poached eggs and kale salad, mixed with dried cranberries and walnuts. It didn’t seem very filling to me. Nor did it look appealing. I was glad I wasn’t expected to eat this. My sugary cereal with slices of banana would serve me well as usual.  
  
  “I can’t move the meeting. I have a prior engagement. It’s at seven and I won’t miss it.” As he walked back into the kitchen, Hale spoke into his slim, flat smartphone. I had his French pressed coffee prepared. The French press thingy had thankfully come with directions. I’d never seen anything like it. He took it from my hands sighing loudly.  
  
  “Lunch here will be the best I can manage. I’ll be here at twelve like we planned. They can join me here. Otherwise this will have to wait.”  
  
  Hale ended the call and slipped the phone into his pocket. He greeted me, but it took effort.  
  
  “Good morning Sam,” he said with a tight smile. He didn’t look as if the morning was good at all. If he’d let me fix him a real breakfast he might enjoy it better.  
  
  “I’ll take my breakfast outside. Where is the paper?” He asked, walking quickly towards the exit of the kitchen.  
  
  I snatched up the paper I’d retrieved from the door and lifted his plate to follow. I wondered if this was what he wanted. Someone to wait on him hand and foot. I’d never been around a man who needed a servant. My daddy would’ve been slapped, if he’d asked my momma to serve him. But I was the hired help. Maybe this was a rich people thing. I had a lot to learn.  
  
  The romantic guy from yesterday was gone and in his place was… this. I wasn’t here for romance anyway. At some point a line would be drawn. I guess Hale was drawing it now.  
  
  He took a seat at the table and I waited until he settled back in his chair. I then placed the plate to his front, positioning the paper to its left.  
  
  “Can I get you anything else?”  
  
  He looked at his food and then me. “This is perfect. Are you not eating?”  
  
  “I ate earlier this morning when I woke up.”  
  
  He motioned to the seat across the way. “Please join me if you will. I hate to eat alone.”  
  
  I liked it out here in the open with the energy of the city just below us. Maybe waiting and eating with Hale wouldn’t be so bad. That is, if he wanted me here.  
  
  I took the seat across from his stare and he immediately studied my clothes. “Better. Much, much better.”  
  
  Saying thank you seemed silly since he’d bought the clothing and knew what it looked like before. The fact that my clothes hadn’t been good enough still bothered me, but this was different. I was wearing a work uniform. I guess that was how I’d look at it. I’d have to let that go. He might know what was best for me. Here anyway, in the city.  
  
  “I wasn’t sure what to wear while working.”  
  
  His smile was one of amusement. “You chose well. Did you try on the cocktail dresses?”  
  
  I assumed they were the fancy ones, so I hadn’t done more than touch them. I was afraid of the price tags and fabric. “No,” I replied, with a shake of my head.  
  
  “Make sure they fit and that you like them. You’ll be needing them soon enough.”  
  
  I would? He was ready to take me out in public? My heart rate increased and then I realized I might go into a panic if he did. Or if he kept talking about it.  
  
  “Will you be having a lunch meeting here?” I asked to change the subject. I would need to know how many were coming and what to prepare when they did.  
  
  He nodded. “Yes. For three.”  
  
  Good. That would give me something to do until then. I hated feeling like my time was wasted.  
  
  “You can clean my bedroom and bathroom. I’m going to stay out here and handle a few calls. Hopefully I’ll get a moment’s peace, to read the paper without being bothered.”  
  
  There was something else to do. I hadn’t thought about that. I should get in a maid’s frame of mind. He was confusing me with all this talk of parties and fancy clothes. I couldn’t remember who I was.  
  
  “Okay,” I said, instead of the “yes sir,” which almost fell from my lips. I wasn’t sure he’d like that very much. “Can I get you more coffee?” I asked.  
  
  He shook his head. “Not yet. Give me about fifteen minutes. I’ll be ready for another cup.”  
  
  I glanced at my watch. He seemed to like things on a schedule. “I’ll be inside cleaning if you need anything.”  
  
  He tilted his head to look. Those eyes were something else. Straight from a magazine. He could easily model in his spare time. “Do you like it here?” he asked.  
  
  I nodded. “Yes. Yes I do.”  
  
  A grin spread across his face. “Good. I like having you here.” Then his hand reached forward to gently caress the inside of my wrist with his finger. “You make things that were dreary, exciting.”  
  
  I wasn’t sure how I was doing that exactly. But it made me smile and my cheeks heat up into a blush that he noticed in an instant. “I’m glad,” I replied, almost breathless.  
  
  He chuckled and pulled his hand back. I hurried inside to take a deep breath and think about what he’d said. Hale was a confusing man. It didn’t seem like he’d be anymore understandable today, tomorrow or forever. I wanted to please him, but a part of me worried about losing myself along the way. While I made his bed and put towels in his bathroom I thought about the luxury that surrounded him. This was a life he fit. I needed to taste it, but I wasn’t really sure I’d ever belong like him. Like now, right now for instance, I wanted to put on cut off jeans, a tank top and knot my hair up. Pile it on top of my head. Although, that wouldn’t do for here. I wasn’t home working on the farm. I was where I’d always dreamed of being and I had to start trying harder to adjust and mold to this world. If I was choosing this life, then I would have to make it work, regardless of the changes involved. Hale had taken a chance by bringing me here and I’d also gambled by coming. Perhaps what would change would be me. A little, not a lot. I would take it a day at a time.  
  
  **Chapter Three**  
  
  “He’s changed your clothing. I liked what you were wearing before.” Ezra’s voice made me jump and turn. He was standing in the kitchen’s entrance. Without thinking I immediately responded. “I’m supposed to look a certain way. Ever heard of a uniform?” Even though it came out kind of harsh, Ezra’s compliment made me feel good. He smirked, crossed his arms over his chest, then leaned against the doorframe. “I just hate to see him do it. There’s nothing wrong with you now. But he’ll change you, wait and see.”  
  
  I turned back to the salad I was making. Him standing there like a cowboy in a painting made me a little nervous. There was no doubt the man was gorgeous. In that Texas cowboy way. Though I knew it was only an act, because he wasn’t, he worked for Hale.  
  
  “Hale is outside with the other guest.”  
  
  He didn’t move. Although I wasn’t looking at him I knew Hale hadn’t budged. I had ears and the man was soundless. He replied, “I know where he is. I’m not in a hurry to join them.”  
  
  Ezra was weird and strange. I didn’t need him intruding with Hale. I wasn’t quite sure what there was between us, but this guy was an employee. He should care about upsetting Hale. Both of us had the same boss.  
  
  “Why’re you in here with me when there’s a meeting that doesn’t include me? Shouldn’t you be with them?” This time I turned to make him leave faster, though I figured he would do what he wanted.  
  
  “Not real big on Hale’s meetings. I don’t have to fuck with this one.”  
  
  Oh, well, okay. I didn’t know what to make of this man. Each episode with him became stranger. I wanted to dislike him, but there was something about him that was attractive, it drew you in. Maybe it was his personality. He didn’t give a shit about much. Or seemed not to care. His vibe was more than dangerous, and that can be really sexy.  
  
  “I need to serve the appetizers.” I lifted the tray of zucchini with the goat cheese tarts I’d made. It was a recipe Felicity had suggested that seemed easy enough. It gave me confidence for dishes that would take more time and contained various ingredients. I was thinking about this when Ezra moved towards me to take the tray from my hands.  
  
  “I’ll take it when I go.”  
  
  That didn’t sound like a good idea. He was a guest of Hale’s. A guest and an employee? This became more and more confusing.  
  
  “Uh, I better take it. That’s my job.”  
  
  Ezra studied me a little too closely. It made me feel like fidgeting and looking away, but I held his gaze and returned it.  
  
  “Are you scared of Hale?” When he asked me his voice dropped. It was lower and almost threatening. Frowning, I shook my head. “Why would I be scared of Hale?”  
  
  His entire body seemed to relax as he gave the tray back to me. “You take it then,” he replied. Then he left without explanation. I took a deep breath, tried to push it from my thoughts and focus on the job I was hired for.  
  
  I gave Ezra a minute to get outside before I followed with the tray I’d prepared. I thought about what momma would say, how she’d react to this: “Lord, that ain’t enough to feed a man! Make a pot roast with potatoes and gravy!”  
  
  Smiling at the thought I took the food. Only Ezra seemed to notice me. I placed the appetizers on the table with his gaze against my skin. I glanced at Hale, who simply nodded, while speaking to the other guest. That was my dismissal.  
  
  Hurrying back inside I slid the glass. Ezra’s focus was still on me. I was accustomed to the stares of men. I just wasn’t used to the Ezra’s. He might think this was some sort of game, but it was my future he was dealing with. I wasn’t going to anger Hale, get fired and sent back to Moulton. Ignoring Ezra was best for the present. Even though he was making it hard.  
  
  The rest of the lunch was the same. Ezra watched me like a hawk. Hale acted as if I was invisible. I managed to  
behave in a way that I thought would make Hale happy.  
  
  When I heard them all leave I finished cleaning up the kitchen while waiting on Hale to come to me. He didn’t say a word. I heard his footsteps down the hall and a door close behind him and then there was silence as usual.  
  
  I went outside to get the rest of the dishes and then made the kitchen perfect. After that I headed for my room. Hale was closed in his office and I could hear his voice through the walls asking questions. It was muffled, but I knew they were questions.  
  
  There was nothing for me to do. I wasn’t sure I was allowed to go out. Was I to wait and expect to be needed? I laid down on the bed with a New Yorker magazine I’d found in the living room. I would read and see what happened. Or perhaps I would fall asleep. The sharp knock on my door sent me bolting upright in the bed like a child from a nightmare. I never took naps at home. This job and the city seemed to wear me to a frazzle. Everything was always in motion. Moulton, Alabama wasn’t here. I hurried to the door to open it. Hale stood there with a grin on his face.  
  
  “Did I disturb your beauty sleep?”  
  
  “Sorry. I don’t know what happened. I haven’t done that very much. Not since I was a baby.” I then blushed. “But, I don’t remember. Being a baby that is.” My God I’m babbling, babbling.  
  
  “You woke up early and spent the entire morning working and doing your job. It’s okay to nap.”  
  
  I was relieved to hear him say that.  
  
  “You are, however, wrinkled. Change into something else. We’ll go out and explore.”  
  
  I was wrinkled? Really? I glanced down and figured I still looked fine, but I didn’t argue with the man. “Okay,” I agreed. “I can’t wait to see the city.”  
  
  To be released from the penthouse I would do what he asked. I wasn’t used to being indoors. It was beginning to feel like a jail and my boss was the jailer who kept me. Naw, that’s too dramatic. I must be imagining things. Hale smiled and walked away.  
  
  I hurried to my closet, once again overwhelmed, with the selection I had to choose from. I managed to find a dress that looked classy but was casual enough for exploring. I chose a pair of sandals with a heel. I wasn’t sure about walking all over New York, but there weren’t any flats in the closet. I brushed my hair and put on some lip-gloss. Studied myself in the mirror. I was still Sammy Jo from Moulton. That hadn’t changed a bit. But there was someone else in my reflection. There was polish and sophistication. I once dreamed that I would see myself dressed in clothes like these. But the reality was even more amazing. I was really living my dream.  
**Chapter Four**  
  
  I thought we would walk the streets. But again Hale surprised me. There was a black Mercedes waiting. When we stepped onto the curb Williams was there to greet us. He opened the door for Hale and myself to slide inside the car.  
  
  “Williams, it’s so good to see you.” The very first friend I’d made in the city was here to join our trip. He grinned and nodded his head.  
  
  “Get in the car Samantha.” Hale spoke tightly from behind me. Breathing down my neck. I wanted to say more to Williams, but Hale seemed annoyed by my greeting, so I slid inside the car onto the smooth leather seats that were warm. Unlike the exterior, they were the color of butter and the temperature inside was perfect.  
  
  “Times Square,” he ordered as Williams closed the door. His attention then turned to me. “You don’t speak to the hired help as if they were your friends. They are my employees.”  
  
  “But I’m the hired help.”  
  
  His frown then eased to neutral. “Not exactly. You’re not like Williams. You’re taking care of my place and I’m meeting your needs.”  
  
  I bought the groceries, cooked and served his lunch and also the lunch of his associates. I cleaned the house and wore what he wanted. And was getting paid to do this. So yes, I was a hireling. An employee like Williams. But I also didn’t want to argue because Hale was taking me out. I was no longer locked in the penthouse. Only seeing those he wanted me to see.  
  
  “Okay,” I replied without interest. I wanted to say so much more, but I didn’t, this life being foreign to me, and perhaps this behavior was normal. Being open to a different way was a must if I wanted to live here. Moulton wasn’t the norm. Momma’s program was nothing like this. Say, for example, if you tried to compare the sun to a forty-watt light bulb. Moulton being the bulb.  
  
  “What exactly do you want to see in Times Square? I’ve often wondered what attracts the tourist.”  
  
  What you thought of when you heard the name of the city were Times Square and the Statue of Liberty.  
  
  “I’ve seen it on television since I was a kid. I want to stand in the middle and absorb it. Take it in like I own it or something.”  
  
  Hale chuckled. “Fair enough.”  
  
  I watched the city pass by from the window, wishing we were out there walking, soaking up the energy that rolled off the people as they hurried to their appointments. They had their coffee in hand, phones at their ears, with shopping bags or briefcases swinging. There was so much excitement that including myself seemed like the thing to be doing. I wanted to hustle somewhere.  
  
  “She’s changing her shoes,” I said in awe, as a woman came from the subway. She jerked off the sneakers she was wearing to slip on heels for the streets.  
  
  “That’s the business class for you.” Hale said it without emotion. I wasn’t sure what he meant by that, but I thought it was incredibly cool.  
  
  A young guy started to walk into the street while staring down at his cellphone. I started to yell to stop him, when a yellow cab blared his horn. It flew right past him, barely missing his leg, the cab never slowing down. I then decided that phones in the streets were a major no-no for me.  
  
  “Do people get hit often?” I glanced at Hale who was also busy on his phone living the life of speed.  
  
  “Daily,” he replied.  
  
  “That’s seven dead people in a week. In Moulton that would take two years.”  
  
  He stuck his phone in his pocket and finally looked up. “Let’s go see Times Square. Then we’ll go shopping on Fifth Avenue before we eat at one of my favorites. It’s in the Meat Packing District. You’ll like it.”  
  
  That all sounded wonderful to me. “Okay,” I agreed.  
  
  Before Williams stopped the car I could see it. The big, bright and shiny glowing place I’d daydreamed all my life. I was here. It was just like the movies. I wanted to push the car door open and leap from the vehicle running. I then thought about the cabbies and their obvious reluctance to slow for pedestrians in the street. I remained in the car with amazement. I didn’t want to be killed while exploring.  
  
  “Is it all you thought it would be?”  
  
  “More,” I replied honestly.  
  
  “Is this good sir?” Williams asked. He pulled up right beside what looked to be a massive M&M store.  
  
  “Yes. I’ll text when we’re ready.” Hale told him with a passionless bluntness.  
  
  I started to say thank you to Williams, but bit my tongue instead. He got out of the car with my fingers on the latch, beginning to open my door. Hale put his hand on mine. “No. He gets the door.”  
  
  Another thing I didn’t understand. I was perfectly capable of opening my own. I didn’t see why Williams had to. But I waited and let the man do it. The silliness piled and piled. As I climbed out I whispered a “thank you” before turning my attention to the screens, their colors running the square.  
  
  “Oh my. My, oh my.”  
  
  I wasn’t the only tourist here. They were everywhere. It was easy to see the majority of people in the square weren’t New Yorkers. The busy suits and ties were absent. Just cameras, families, and what appeared to be a cowboy standing in his underwear. Oh, and also, there were cartoon characters and a sad looking Mickey Mouse.  
  
  “Why is that man in his underwear?” I asked Hale as he came up beside me. An Asian family was having its picture made with the almost naked man and his guitar. A line had formed behind them. There were females my age waiting with their phones, their sorority shirts identical.  
  
  “The Naked Cowboy,” Hale responded. “One of the wonders of Times Square with its tourists.” He didn’t seem to think it was wondrous. His tone was again annoyed.  
  
  “He just poses for photos and whatnot? Or does he play the guitar and sing?”  
  
  Hale rolled his eyes. “He gets money for the photos. People tip him. Now, let’s go stand in the middle and let you take it all in so we can go. There are more enjoyable parts of the city that don’t include these people.”  
  
  I was enjoying myself just fine right here, but I didn’t say a word. I followed Hale to stand in the middle. I needed a picture of this. To print and send home to Hazel. She would squeal when she saw where I was.  
  
  “Will you take a photo of me?” I dug for my phone in the chaos of my purse and the searching drew his attention.  
  
  “Of course,” he replied. Then frowned at the sight of my purse. “After this we’re buying you a new one. Several new purses in fact.”  
  
  I glanced down at the purse my mother had made me. She’d sewn it for my graduation. I liked my purse. But it didn’t match my clothing. There was an obvious difference and he saw it, another thing I wouldn’t have imagined.  
  
  Handing him my phone I stood back and smiled. I extended my hands as if supporting the world, or more like Times Square in my palms. Very touristy indeed. Just as he took the photo a woman came up to his hip. She was painted metallic gold and wearing a tiny bikini. He frowned, “no thanks” was his sharp reply, though it didn’t seem to faze her. She had money tucked in her bottoms. I assumed she was another of those photo people who get tipped for taking pictures. I was tempted to get one with her. Jamie would think it was hilarious.  
  
  “I’ve had all of this I can take. It feels and smells disgusting.” Hale said it too loud and the gold woman left and then he came over to me. I agreed the smell wasn’t very agreeable, but we were standing on the world’s crossroads. Sometimes adventure was smelly.  
  
  “Let’s go shop for the items you need.”  
  
  He then pressed his hand on my lower back and led me to the waiting Williams. I didn’t say a word.  
  
  **Chapter Five**  
  
  Shopping was more intense than I imagined. I picked some clothing but didn’t get to wear it, because models wore it for me. I then chose the items I wanted and tried them on myself. When I thought we were done, because it took forever, we ended up somewhere else.  
  
  The last stop was Louis Vuitton. I bought two purses quickly. As quickly as Hale would allow me. They cost more than any automobile my momma ever owned. As exciting as it felt to have t  
hem, I felt guilty for taking them with me. I wasn’t sure I wanted the life I was living, though I always thought I would. I guess adjusting could take some time. I’d dreamed of beautiful clothing, expensive meals and a life that was charmed. But the reality of it was different. Hale wasn’t in love with me and I wasn’t his Cinderella. There was nothing about him that was prince-like. I had no idea what I was to the man or what we were together. And it was I, Sammy Jo Knox, who was stuck in the middle of this “thing.” Whatever this “thing” was becoming.  
  
  Several times throughout the day Hale would answer his phone. I thought that might bring the shopping to an end. Deep down I wanted it to. The money he was spending increased my discomfort, because it wasn’t necessary. If momma could see this she wouldn’t approve. It was ego, extravagance and arrogance. Neither of the three did she care for. Was that why it bothered me so much? I knew momma wouldn’t like it? She’d warn me and I would ignore it. What if this time she was right?  
  
  His phone rang again after Louis Vuitton and he checked it without responding. Looked at the screen and then held it. We were settled in the back of the car. I thought we might be going to dinner. Although, after the shopping, I wasn’t sure he wanted to do that. He knew that the lavish treatment had set me off kilter a bit. Actually, it had floored me. He then turned to me and spoke.  
  
  “I need to go to dinner with a friend who is only in town tonight. You’re not ready for that kind of thing.” He then looked back at his phone. “Your clothing is, but the polish of the clothing isn’t sufficient enough. I’ll drop you off at the penthouse. You can put away your new things and enjoy the evening as you wish.”  
  
  I wanted to sigh in relief. Being alone sounded good. I was always tense with Hale. Unsure what he’d say or do next. I didn’t want to feel this way. If I could just put my finger on what had changed that was making me nervous around him.  
  
  When Williams parked at the penthouse I was anxious to escape the car. To return to the jail I’d wanted to flee earlier in the day. I was tense from my time with Hale. I wasn’t typically like this.  
  
  He stepped onto the curb then held out his hand for me to be helped from the car. I could do it myself, but I let him. It seemed rude not to do so. Once outside he pressed a kiss to my cheek and spoke softly into my face.  
  
  “Williams will deliver your things after he’s dropped me off. I’ll see you in the morning Samantha.”  
  
  Then he climbed back into the car. Williams closed the door behind him and hurried back around to leave. I didn’t watch them go. I was ready to get back inside.  
  
  “Man, I need a break.”  
  
  I’d looked forward to going into the city. Hale had made it something else. The shopping had been stressful and confusing. Why did I need so much? I liked my comfortable clothing and wanted to be able to wear it, especially when touring the city. What I’d imagined I would do was walk the streets and eat the food vendors were selling. Not be whisked from place to place. The way Hale was showing me the city wasn’t my idea of an adventure.  
  
  He’d be leaving soon though. Hale said he didn’t stay but a few days a month so my solo time was coming. I could do exactly as I’d dreamed. When I stepped from the elevator to head for the penthouse my eyes landed on Ezra. I froze. Couldn’t move. He was dressed as casually as he’d been this morning. Relaxed, he leaned on the wall. Whatever it was he did, didn’t require business attire. I couldn’t imagine Ezra being bossed. Taking orders didn’t seem like his style. There was a dangerous air about him. Yet, he didn’t scare me a bit.  
  
  “Hale won’t be home until late.” I then forced myself forward to the door. I wasn’t going to stare at the man. He’d think I’d lost my marbles. Although, he was nice to stare at.  
  
  “Yes, I know. I came to take you to dinner.”  
  
  What? That got my attention. I paused and looked up at him. “Hale wouldn’t like that at all.”  
  
  Ezra smirked as if that were funny. “It would seem you’re figuring him out.”  
  
  He was amused, but I was not. I then entered the code to the penthouse and stepped inside the door.  
  
  “If there isn’t anything I can do for you, then I will see you some other time.”  
  
  Ezra didn’t respond. Instead he followed me inside and stopped, inches away from my body. His warmth made me tremble and shiver. I forced my eyes to lift. They met his, waiting on mine.  
  
  “We can have dinner here. I’ll be glad to cook.”  
  
  Again, this was not okay. What was Ezra up to?  
  
  “I don’t think that would be appropriate.”  
  
  Ezra shrugged. “I’m not worried about appropriate. Sammy Jo, please relax.” He then walked past me towards the bar making himself at home. I watched him pour himself a whisky over three ice cubes before he turned back to me. “Care for a drink?”  
  
  I shook my head no and huffed.  
  
  He took a sip and the way his throat muscles flexed were as appealing as everything else. I jerked my gaze off him and stared at the windows wondering if I should call Hale. I didn’t want to get Ezra in trouble, but then I wasn’t sure he cared. He didn’t exactly seem the type to cower to a wealthy man. It was almost as if he mocked Hale.  
  
  “I’m not leaving Sammy Jo. Hale isn’t coming back tonight. I know where he is and the person he’s with. I’m here to keep you company. Nothing more than that.”  
  
  He was here to keep me company? So Hale knew he was here? Why hadn’t Hale just told me?  
  
  “Why? I don’t need any company.” I wasn’t sure what I was saying.  
  
  He didn’t respond right away. Ezra walked over to the balcony doors. I waited in silence for his answer.  
  
  “Because I like being around you. You’re different from the rest of this city. More of what I knew, what I miss. You bring back the forgotten I suppose. It’s pleasant.”  
  
  That astounded and intrigued me. “You mean your home? Your town in Texas?” I thought Alabama must be similar to Texas. Not that I’d been to Texas. Maybe little towns were alike.  
  
  “Something like that,” he responded. “Sometimes missing is missing. Doesn’t matter where the place might be.

Following our successful migration to ElfHosted, I'm excited to announce another significant update to Nuvio Streams, this time focused on a major expansion of our content sources.

**For Those Who Don't Know**

For anyone new here, **Nuvio Streams** is a Stremio addon that finds direct streaming links from various websites, offering an alternative to torrent-based solutions. It's a scraper addon, which means it's more fragile than debrid services but can be a great backup. You can find more details in the ""About Nuvio Streams"" section below.

# Thank You!

First, I want to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has installed, used, and provided feedback on this addon. What started as a small project has grown beyond what I initially expected, and it's all thanks to this amazing community. Your support and enthusiasm have been incredible motivation to keep improving and maintaining this addon despite the challenges of scraper-based solutions.

# What's New in v0.4.0

I've integrated three new providers to significantly enhance the streaming library:

>**New High-Quality Provider Added**  
I've integrated a new source specializing in **4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Blu-ray quality streams**. (Please note: a fast and stable internet connection is recommended for these streams).

>**New Regional Provider (Asian Dramas)**  
A new provider focused on **Korean, Chinese, and other popular Asian dramas** has been added, bringing a huge library of TV shows to the addon.

>**New Regional Provider (Bollywood/Indian)**  
Added a source for a variety of **Indian shows/movies**, including Bollywood.

Additional improvements:

* More robust error handling when providers fail
* Better performance with concurrent provider searches
* Backend infrastructure improvements for stability
* More accurate provider timeouts to prevent extended loading

# Provider Status

The reliability of streaming sources can change frequently. Currently, the addon uses a mix of providers with varying stability. Some sources work well for most content, while others may be less reliable or require extra configuration. I am continuously working to improve and maintain provider performance.

>**Important:** Selecting a large number of providers can lead to slow search times. For the best performance, enable only the providers you use most often.

# About Nuvio Streams

This is a scraper-based addon that aggregates direct HTTP streams from multiple providers. It works best as:

💡 A solution for users who prefer direct HTTP streams  
🔄 A complementary tool alongside debrid-based addons

While debrid services typically offer better reliability, quality, and selection, Nuvio Streams can provide alternatives when other methods fail.

# An Important Reality Check

⚠️ This addon, like all scraper-based services, could stop working at any moment without notice. The providers I connect to frequently change their websites, add new anti-scraping measures, or can shut down completely. As a solo developer maintaining this as a hobby project, I do my best to keep things running, but there are no guarantees. If you decide to use Nuvio Streams, please understand it's more fragile than paid debrid services and expect occasional issues or downtime with streams. It works best as a complementary solution rather than your only streaming option.

# Cookie Configuration (Mandatory)

For the best experience with my primary provider (especially for 4K/HDR/DV content), using a personal cookie is compulsory:

>**Note:** Due to recent changes, the Showbox provider now **requires** a personal cookie to work.

|Without Personal Cookie|With Personal Cookie|
|:-|:-|
|Shared bandwidth limits|Your own bandwidth|
|Limited to files <9GB|Access to files of any size|
|Shared resources|100GB/month personal quota|
|Slower speeds|Faster streaming speeds|

This feature is **Extremely Recommended** for the best experience, especially if you want access to larger, higher-quality streams.

# Self-Hosting vs. Public Instance

The public instance is convenient but has limitations. Self-hosting gives you:

1. Direct access to providers without additional proxies
2. Better performance and fewer timeouts
3. More configuration options
4. Access to providers that may be restricted on public instances

Self-hosting instructions: [GitHub](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreaming)

# Private Instances via ElfHosted

For those who want better reliability without technical setup:

✅ Separate rate limits from the heavily-used public instance  
✅ faster fetching

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How reliable is this addon long-term?**  
A: As a scraper addon, its reliability depends entirely on the external providers. They can change or disappear at any time. When that happens, I'll try to update or replace them when possible, but there are no guarantees.

**Q: What's the difference between personalized and non-personalized usage?**  
A: Non-personalized users share limited bandwidth and can only access streams under 9GB from certain providers. Personalized users get their own 100GB/month of quota and access to all quality levels.

**Q: Does this addon use torrents or P2P technology?**  
A: No. This addon only scrapes direct HTTP streams from websites. It does not use P2P or torrents.

**Q: Why do some streams not work?**  
A: Providers can change their websites or go offline at any time. When this happens, streams will stop working until I update the addon.

**Q: How often is the addon updated?**  
A: As an indie developer with limited time, I update when I can. If a provider breaks, I'll try to fix it or find a replacement, but please be patient.

**Q: Will more providers be added?**  
A: I'm always looking for reliable providers to add. This update brings three new ones, and I'll continue to explore more in the future.

**Q: Do I need to reconfigure my settings on the new instance?**  
A: Yes. You'll need to set up your cookie and provider preferences again on the new ElfHosted instance.

**Q: I used a previous version of the addon, will my configuration transfer?**

There was a female Grass Spider in my kitchen sink this morning and I attempted to free her many times to no avail. The sink was a bit too damp to do the cup & paper trick (although in hindsight I should have used a card or something plastic) I opted out of doing the dishes and made my coffee. Later I moved a dish and revealed her mate! Smaller male with good sized pedipalps scurried over. I giggled at what they may have been up to all evening! Oh to be a spider stuck in the sink with their mate. At this time however I did need to do at least one dish and considering how large my sink is (old porcelain farm style) I thought I could wash & dump the excess what right into the drain. I was wrong. A rush of water went a way I didn't expect and took the male out first. The female scurried & got stuck in a puddle. I scooped the male out and put him on a wood block to dry but I fear Palmolive (no matter how clean & clear) is too much for his little body. That made me soo sad to write. 

By this point I am devasted and I start crying & sit down in the living room. Then I go back to see if the female made it through the puddle in the rush of it all but she did not. I prayed and washed her down the drain. Then suddenly her mate popped up from death curling!! I start crying again. I apologize for killing his wife. And then he curled back up.

Perhaps not as useful than the previous ones, but if they stay in my personal notes only, they would certainly be even less useful.

**Engine access through bloom cockpit wall**

First an easy one, but one that might be considered a bug... so enjoy the convenience while it lasts. Engine can be accessed from inside when the engine is attached to the side of (sideways installed) bloom cockpit. (Does not work with metal or bloom walls or windows, or normal cockpit.)

**Piping on the roof improvement**

Piping along roof sections, especially with a door next to a section, having its issues, made me initially to use the previously shown arrangement of visiting downstairs ceiling, which caused a bit of an eye-sore in the captain's bedroom. Here are the ""before"" screenshots:

[Roof before](https://preview.redd.it/rn69rl4dmo9f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef6cb09c86236c3bf6eba593a43b848ebb727119)

I finally figured out an alternate route.. but I could only use it on one side of the ship, due to other side having a lot of other pipes in the way. Luckily, the bedroom was on the improved side. I also managed to make working socket-to-socket direct connections the second time ever in my game. This case is something that perhaps won't help many others, since it requires two rooms/wall above the roof level, but it might still give partial ideas useful in other situations.  The reason for needing two floors above the roof is because the door-wall does not allow anything through or on it, so the pipes must go from the roof straight up over the door-wall to the socket in the wall above the door.

Here are screenshots showing the routing and ""after""-shot for the (rearranged) bedroom with no pipes:

[Roof after](https://preview.redd.it/mi93n9owmo9f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b3204b7a78046e5d6ffa03cfd0170c384af7b14)

**Pipes diagonally ""through the air""**

Staying with the topic of piping, this came up on Discord; there is a somewhat limited possibility to have pipes going more or less diagonally ""through the air"", i.e. no backing wall or ceiling etc. However, it does require some surface to get the pipe started, and another surface to aim the end, and for both, not all surfaces work. And like mentioned in the previous tips-list, the starting surface can not be removed after the pipe is ready.

Getting the pipes diagonal but still along some main axis surface orientation is somewhat easy, but fully freely diagonal pipe is very difficult to make.

Here are couple ""proof of concept"" screenshots. Note, IIRC, latter pipe did not need helper surface for starting it, as there is cockpit above its starting point, and the pipe could be started on its side wall, then turned down (and diagonal), and its ""end surface"" is something further away (distant shelf or such). After placing it, an earlier starting socket/pipe was removed, and only that diagonal pipe ""in the air"" remains.

https://preview.redd.it/l2skwddwno9f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d9721ef6d34b742a881111c8a4cba0aaee4c261

Sometimes arranging the helper surfaces can be tricky. I noticed that moth vivarium can be stacked, and also storage boxes as long they are alternated with vivarium, like this:

https://preview.redd.it/ev59qexnoo9f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd3fc44f071aa52a6a2c7e417f358bb4762c3816

And this example is less awkward intentionally non-diagonal version (that is, I made several tries to get the pipe as directly vertical as possible), where the railing was used to get the pipe started, and then going straight down seemingly ""in the air"" without backing wall. (The previous list has another similar example.)

https://preview.redd.it/telv54vroo9f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c09b2e1acce8a602f735adf7b1cc9c422c37397e

**Firing arcs**

The possibly aiming sector/arc of deck extractors can sometimes change a bit depending even on the exact spot they are placed. I managed to get decent sectors by fine tuning with positions, and angling their placement diagonally, like this:

https://preview.redd.it/vkp5swc9po9f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60097c24fb7cd7aac0804e3db65814d1e0c89f5c

**Decorations with a story**

The lead zeppelins, combined with the large open area and two floors of free height gave me an pure decorative idea... with a story.  After placing them, I realized there can be many different stories explaining the arrangement. Feel free to come up with your story.  Their path leads to the dining/cafe/catering area..

[\\""First to cafe gets all the honey!\\""... or something else going on?](https://preview.redd.it/0p8v54lupo9f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f91023c9c4401875e6992c3b1f7af98f7e6e5a7)

**A little bit of imperfection**

Having some things slightly out of place or ""incorrect"" can make things look a bit more ""natural"". Even if it is sometimes so little that one doesn't realize it first, the little imperfections can have a big effect. For example, if there is a row of lamps, one of them could be turned off. That damn lazy janitor never doing his work...

Here is an example from the dining/cafe area; chairs the way they were left after use, fridge conveniently angled, plates and cups with tiny shifts in placement. (Note, the coffee cups on the shelf look like they are a bit too far out of place... it is just due to perspective and the shelf having the placement surface too high, i.e. a cosmetic bug.)

Both with way more liberal and tolerant laws than the USA. While they got lots of migrations, I did not get a single one, A SINGLE foreign migrant in all the game. Despite having HUGE SoL. Full employment.

At some point is because I thought I needed open borders and multiculutralism from the latest update but I saw America and they had national supremacy and controlled borders. Censorship, etc. All more regressive laws and they kept getting huge migration

I just gave up on both games as my economy reached a bottleneck and barely grew because of lack of population.

I played my first 1.9 as Spain. I barely got any migration despite having the wealthiest 2 economy in the world behind USA. But I just thought it was a bug or just because my laws weren't that progressive as I wasn't trying to go progressive with that run but more like stable chilled PB conservatism.

But then I got two south american full progressive runs and I did not get a single person

Anyone knows what is going on? Is it a bug? Am I missing anything?

It's a shame because I was LOVING my Brazil campaign going full agrarian coffee plantations. First SoL in the game, one of the highest GDP per capita and total GDP #8, but then I ran out of workers so my economy just stagnated. New production methods was not enough to keep up. And I only got the Journal of migration to the americas in the 1900s, so at that point I was bored and migration was barely anything compared to what my economy needed to go electric while keep growing the plantation so I started losing ranks in GDP and SoL so I just dropped it",2,1751126513.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

I’m 27, Melbourne-based, mixed ethnicity, tall, broad, with tanned skin, black messy hair and a beard ... think “lumberjack Dom” with a slow, deep voice and a soft spot for filth. Semi-experienced with BDSM, but deeply into exploring, especially with someone curious, responsive, and just a little depraved.

I write smut and used to record audio erotica (might get back into it). Random fact: I once modelled jewellery using just my hands. I still like uploading hand pics occasionally.

Emotionally open, clingy in the fun way, love cheeky voice notes, day-long flirting, and spontaneous calls.

**What I’m Looking For**
Basically a ditry little minx. A vixen minded succubus. A naughty little filthy thing.

Someone expressive, dirty-minded, a little obsessive, and down to explore connection and kink. If you’re flirty, emotionally available, and love both soft touches and being told exactly where to put your hands, we’ll get along.

I usually find I gel more with women of colour, especially Asian,  African or Arab, but it’s not a dealbreaker if you’re not.

Local to Melb? Let’s grab coffee. Online? At least be in a similar timezone. You must be 18+.

To be frank, yesterday’s pitchers for both teams were better arms than those taking the mound this evening, and that encounter finished at a staggering 24 runs.

Hello everyone,

I’m really confused about a situation that is hurting my mental health to a certain place, but I tend to have a difficult time leaving someone. I want to ask for your advice on what is happening so I can understand the situation better.

In February, a man saw me on Raya, then DM’d me on Instagram. It took me a few weeks to reply, but once I did, we started exchanging voice messages every evening for a couple of weeks. Eventually we moved to texting, phone calls, and nightly FaceTimes. Everything was really nice, he called me himself in the evenings and I felt really supported.

He asked me out, but I was really focused on my job search, so I suggested just meeting for coffee. The date was nice. Afterward, he asked me out for dinner, but I pushed for hooking up instead of a real date (something I now regret because I hadn’t dated in years and was emotionally out of practice). That dynamic continued for about two months. Later on I brought that I do want to go on a date and he said he did too and it confused me originally when I said I didn’t want to because he thought maybe I didn’t truly like him, which is really fair and I explained more from my side of I was nervous and thought I shouldn’t because I should focus on my job search, but I was wrong for that. 

Things started getting rocky. He often made plans and then didn’t follow through, saying “I’ll call you back” and never did. When I brought it up, he said that’s just how he is — he does it with everyone, but did see it wasn’t a good trait.

What drew me to him was how open he was to hearing about my emotions, which I’m not used to. But recently it’s been difficult:

	•	We confirmed plans for Sunday on Sat morning, but when I reached out that evening, he claimed he didn’t know we were still on. He said I didn’t reach out to confirm plans, but we had just discussed on Sat morning and I tried calling him Sunday afternoon to which he didn’t pick up. I was hurt when he called me at 9:30 PM and said he didn’t know we were still meeting because this was like our third attempt to see each other in a row that had not gone through. I was sharing my emotions of how I’m feeling sad that I feel like the energy isn’t there as it was in the beginning. I was really sad and trying to express my emotions in a safe way. While we were talking about it, he picked up a call from his mom, said he’d call me back, and never did. I messaged him and tried calling him, but got no response so at this point I wasn’t feeling well because I have a big fear of abondement and this really triggered that.

	•	The next day he messaged to say his friend from college had died and he was grieving. 

	•	on Wednesday he called me to talk over video call and I said I understood, but it was just bad timing. He said he’d be free after 6pm to talk. I called twice — no answer. No response Thursday either.

	•	Friday I communicated I’m sorry I haven’t been the most supportive this week because I have fearful avoidant attachment style which basically means there’s a war in my head sometimes when I think I’m being abandoned he said he’d be free around 4:30. He didn’t call until 9:30, saying his phone died and he couldn’t get into his car, but my texts had delivered at 4:30 and 5:30 PM though. I don’t really want to accuse someone of lying. Then later he called me at 9:45 PM

That night we had a good 40-minute call, shared some laughs, and I opened up about having an anxious/fearful attachment style. I wanted to show support for the rough week he had, but I also wanted him to see how the week was difficult for me and he did. I felt kind of unhappy that we didn’t have a conversation of how communicate better. His phone died again, he said he’d get his charger from the car — and then disappeared. He said he would call me back and never did. I tried calling him and I also messaged him (which was delivered), but he did not respond to me. I really thought he wouldn’t do that again at that moment because of the conversation we were having and it’s because it’s the only time we really talked in a week.

I texted asking if everything was okay, or if there was something I didn’t understand. Haven’t heard back. I still haven’t heard back this morning when I tried calling again.

I kind of have a difficult past and I’ve also dating one narcissistic person and been in a painful DV relationship. I think I sometimes make bad decisions of who to date, but it’s really difficult for me to leave a person because I really desire some kind of emotional connection. It’s just getting to a place where it feels unhealthy for me and I’m confused what portion of that is me and what portion of that is the situation.

Yesterday I tried using Nescafé Gold Espresso, but I was told it’s actually instant coffee, so I didn’t end up using it. I also didn’t realize I had to stop the shot manually, so my espresso came out really watery. Same with my coffee. It was just kind of meh. I moved on.

Today, I bought some Starbucks Pike Place Roast (medium roast) whole beans and gave it another try. I weighed out 18 grams, but my portafilter couldn’t hold it all, so I used a little less. I have a scale, but my glass is too heavy for it to register properly. Because of that, I couldn’t measure out the usual 1:2 ratio and just tried to eyeball it.

When I pressed the brew button, the machine made a sound like it was starting, then went quiet. Nothing came out. If I loosen the portafilter a bit, the liquid starts splattering, but from the edges instead of the spout.

The machine worked fine the day before, so I’m not sure what changed. Could it be my grind size? Maybe it’s too coarse? I’m still learning, and I’d really appreciate any tips or insight into what might be going wrong.

I’ll post a pic of my setup below. Any advice would be super helpful. I just bought everything yesterday and I’m trying my best. For now, I made some kind of hazelnut drink using espresso powder and hot water. It actually tastes pretty good, but I definitely want to learn how to use the espresso machine the right way.",0,1751126185.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

My wife and I were driving to the movies. For context, she often criticizes my driving — hitting imaginary brakes, saying things like “watch out,” etc. I consider myself the better driver, and that’s why I usually drive.

On this particular day, we were stopped at a red light. I noticed two guys driving really rashly — cutting lanes, speeding, just generally reckless. I was focused on staying alert and watching what they were doing. The light turned green and I didn’t immediately notice, probably because I was still paying attention to those cars.

My wife turned to me and said: *“It’s green. What are you waiting for?”* — not in a helpful tone, but more like I was being stupid or slow.

I got really angry and snapped. I yelled at her — loudly — for about 30 seconds. I didn’t use abusive language or insults, but I did raise my voice a lot. I said something like: *“I’ve told you so many times not to talk to me like that when I’m driving.”*

She didn’t say anything after that. She didn’t speak to me during the movie and left alone in a cab right after. I tried calling her but she had blocked me. When we got home, she said I didn’t understand her intention — that she wasn’t being rude. I said this isn’t about one comment, it’s about how she consistently does this while I’m driving and I’ve told her repeatedly it bothers me.

She then got really upset, said “shouting is never acceptable,” and broke a coffee mug and a plate.

Now I’m wondering if I was completely in the wrong. I know yelling isn’t great, but I genuinely felt provoked, especially after setting boundaries many times before. She feels like I overreacted and says I’m not listening to her either.

So… AITA for yelling at my wife after that comment?

We talked about it after and I promised to never shout at her like that and instead if I can text her the issues I have and she promised to take them more seriously. We do have a happy marriage and rarely ever fight but this one got a bit out of hand. First proper fight in almost a decade I think.",8,1751126066.0,AmItheKameena,22,0.9,False

I (35F) am European and poly with two lovely long-term partners (Aspen, 35M, and Birch, 40M) - both dyads [names and ages are all approximative]

A little while ago, I met Cypress (30M) in a hobby group. He's an American guy. He's interesting, sweet, hot like the sun, and early on, sent me signs that he's into me. He's single and has dated poly before, so the coast is clear (he knows I'm poly ofc). Once we started chatting, he signposted that he doesn't have much time atm, which is fine by me, as I don't either. It took us a couple of weeks of banter and back and forth, but we have finally managed to plan a date (a proper nice one) in two weeks' time, and I'm beyond excited.

Now my question is: how do I not fuck it up? 

I have basically never dated in the sense that I think American people mean it. It's not really a thing in my culture - we go for a coffee or a movie and then fall into each other (exclusivity implied right off the bat, except if you're poly :p). And besides, my last two relationships that are still ongoing are quite a few years old and started with good old-fashioned confessions because in both cases, we knew each other quite well before we acknowledged feelings.

As a result of all that, I have zero chill. My current partners have zero chill. I have never met chill and couldn't recognise her if she stood before me and waved ice cubes in my face.

Are there unspoken (or spoken) dating rules in the US that I should be aware of going into this? Any common knowledge about texting etiquette, meeting up etiquette, etc? Or is it just the usual ""be sincere with people, and if they're your people, it'll work out""? Should I stop overthinking this and just enjoy (yes, but also)? I really like this guy, and I'd like to not inadvertently commit any weird faux-pas.

I picked up my first xc bike last spring and once I realized I could go fast both on the down AND ups I fell in love.  I built up a fairly crappy bike to something much less crappy, then a few weeks ago I picked up a Cervelo ZFS-5 frameset with 120 front and rear and after swapping over my parts ended up with a 25 lb bullet.  But, I am looking for guidance on how to tune the suspension for best performance.  I have a sid ultimate 3p and sidluxe ultimate 3p on this bike.  My only experience with suspension tuning is with larger bikes and even then I feel like I am always too stiff to handle big hits and really hate that there are so many adjustments.  I just picked up a digital pump to try and be more precise, and after setting sag to the suggested 25% front and 30% rear I found it to be super fast, not bottoming out, but a bit abusive for longer rides.  Like if I wasn't going full-tilt it was more work, making it so I could not recover on the downhills.  And on slower stuff I felt like it was slowing me down.  I have 2 weeks before my next race(60 miles, 7k ft of climbing, really backcountry), so I have some chill rides to work on this but I wanted to ask what folks are doing for their setups on race bikes, ie are you aiming for firm for pedaling, using tokens and lower pressures, etc.  I see a lot of information on the process, bracketing and all that, but not much on how to correct for specific issues.  For example, when I first set up the bike with my old, not easy to read pump I was having issues where the bike would dive when under braking and had limited traction on corners.  I added air, and now that doesn't happen, but it is super harsh.  So do I lower air pressure and add a spacer?  Do I just lower my pressure?  If adjust air pressure, what is a good increment 2 psi, 5 psi? More rebound dampening?  Is there a video that explains this?

1lmpy4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lmpy4u/my_roommates_keep_telling_me_to_take_my/,"My roommates keep telling me to take my medication. Today, I finally did...and wish I didn't.","My phone wouldn't stop buzzing, and it was driving me up the wall. Mom had ignored my calls all day, then had the audacity to *text* me, claiming I’d never tried to reach her. 

I had a mountain of missed calls to prove otherwise, each one more frantic. Like now, for instance, the familiar bzzz in my jeans pocket nearly pushed me over the edge as I reached our front door. 

I was all set to give Mom a piece of my mind when a voice caught me off guard.

“Annabeth?”

Mrs. Wayley, our next door neighbor, was peeking at me through the crack in our fence with a gentle smile. Mrs. Wayley was well into her eighties, but sweet as she was, Mrs. Wayley had a habit of mixing up our names, all of our names. Today, I was apparently Annie, though I looked nothing like my roommate. 

I was a looming brunette; she was a tiny blur of gold. I figured even with bad eyes, it was clear who was who. 

Apparently not. 

The old woman tilted her head, wrinkled eyes wide with curiosity. Her smile faded. “Didn’t you say you were moving out?”

Instead of correcting her, I smiled sweetly. “No, we’re pretty happy here, Mrs. Wayley.”

She shook her head. “Annabeth, you said you were moving. You told me yourself.”

“Uh, no,” I did the smiling and nodding thing. “We’re staying here. I think you're confused.”

Before she could respond, I yanked the door open, and made my escape. The house was unusually warm. The summer heat was brutal, but at least we had air conditioning, and the pros outweighed the cons of this ancient house. Maybe a hundred years old, maybe a thousand. But cozy. 

Falling apart? Absolutely. But also cheap, and it had charm: a strange mix of modern decor and vintage quirks. 

We had two bathrooms, and the tub was practically a swimming pool. Case in point: not many people were welcomed into their living room by a grand Victorian era fireplace.

It was more of a hole in the wall that should probably be condemned, but it was fun to show off to visitors. *”This is where we keep the bodies.”* 

I used to tell the newbies we brought around for drinks. Apparently, the place used to be a psychiatric hospital. 

Which only upped the macabre appeal. I shrugged off my jacket. The hallway light was off, so I flicked it back on, dumping my backpack on the shoe rack. Which was emptier than usual. Maybe Annie was finally getting rid of her babies. “Anyone alive?”

“Nope!” a familiar voice bounced back. Harry. My phone buzzed. I pulled it out and glanced at the screen: Sure enough, a missed call, just now. From Mom. Beneath it, a text: ""Mika, please call me.”

I ignored her for once and strode into our lounge, the epitome of comfort. The windows were wide open, fresh summer air filtering through the blinds. The room was a mess: a coffee table cluttered with books and papers, our ratty Craigslist couch awkwardly sitting in front of the TV. 

The carpet was out of fashion decades ago, and the pattern rug in front of the fireplace had to be haunted. But it was home. I collapsed into battered leather. The lump sitting next to me was still in his pajamas, thick red hair hanging in unblinking eyes. 

Harry Senior was my recluse of a housemate who never went to class. Smart. Pretentious. Cute. Three words I’d never say to his face. Harry was a mad genius, and that was his downfall. He was Dexter without the laboratory, and slightly more unhinged. 

He even had the evil laugh. He'd be up at 3am mixing concoctions that could land him on a watch list while the rest of us were asleep. When I first met him, his icebreaker was, “Yeah, I'm trying to make the elixir of life.” 

Totally normal.

I knew Harry in two modes. When he had something to fix, he became hyper-fixated and fully obsessed. Then he'd eventually burn out and resort to caveman brain. Rinse and repeat. Despite the sticky summer heat, Harry was curled up with his knees to his chest, playing a video game in his very own Harry-shaped dent in the couch. 

Trying to remove Harry from his dent meant certain death. When my phone buzzed violently on my knee, I ignored it. 

It buzzed again. I stuffed it between my legs. Harry shot me the side-eye, focused on the final boss. He was doing it again. 

Trying not to smile and ultimately failing, the corners of his mouth curving into a smirk. 

He tried to shove me off when I made myself comfy, using his knees as a leg rest. I chose to ignore him, instead following his character as he jumped over a pile of corpses, dove onto a horse, and charged toward a looming, leviathan-ish creature.

“Soooo, what's going on?” He asked casually. I could tell by his expression he didn't care. 

Harry was our neurodivergent couch-potato. 

When things happened, he either didn't care, didn't notice, or both. 

Still, at least he was making an effort. 

“Mom keeps calling me,” I said, relaxing into familiar couch creases. 

Harry snorted. “So, answer her.”

“Well, yeah, but she keeps putting the phone down on me! She’s driving me insane,” I jumped up, restless. 

I was thirsty, so I dragged myself into the kitchen. When I opened the refrigerator to grab a beer, it was warm, sitting on the top shelf. Weird, the refrigerator was definitely on. I made coffee, but the milk was spoiled. So, no beans for me then. I slammed the fridge shut. 

“Did you guys break the refrigerator?” I laughed, tossing Harry a beer that he easily caught with one hand.

He shot me a dorito-stained grin. “If it’s broken, it wasn’t me.”

Which meant it was him. 

I left Harry to slay the final boss. 

I needed to shower and change into something that wasn’t glued to my skin. I was starting to regret wearing a sweater when it was teetering on 90 degrees outside. 

I felt my phone vibrate again on the way upstairs as I awkwardly jumped over Annie, who was sitting on the bottom step with her head nestled in her arms. 

I gave her a pat on the head. Annie was hungover; I could tell from her groan when I nudged her. Plus she was still wearing her outfit from the night before: jeans and a cropped tee, her golden curls spilling onto her knees. 

Fun fact: When I first met Annabeth Mara in my freshman year of college, I thought she was a bitch. She gave off, like, “Do not talk to me” vibes. 

Annie had a do-not-talk-to-me smile, so the whole time we were talking, I was convinced she hated me. I realized I was wrong when Annabeth grabbed my face with her manicure, turned me towards her, lips split into a smile, and said, “I feel like we’re going to be besties!”

Fast forward five years, and we were in our twenties. Annabeth was my non-biological sister. With a heart bigger than Jupiter, and zero filters. Annie's biggest flaw was her borderline alcohol addiction. I loved her, but we were planning an intervention. 

She also had a mouth like a sailor, and simmering anger issues, especially when she didn't get her own way. “I'm fine,” she mumbled into her lap. “I’m gonna go to sleep. Like, right here.”

I nudged her with my foot. “On the stairs?”

“It's comfy,” Annie paused, her voice collapsing into an audible gulp. “Also, if I look up, I, um, I think I'm going to throw up.”

“I JUST cleaned the floor,” Harry snapped from the lounge. I could tell by his tone he was losing to the final boss—slightly strained, teetering on a yell. It wouldn't be long before he started attempting to bite his controller, swiftly followed by begging.

“Don’t move her, Mika,” he warned. “If she upchucks, *you’re* cleaning.”

“Listen to Dad,” Annie murmured into her knees. 

Harry didn't have a “dad” bone in him. The only reason he had been christened the “Dad” of the house was due to his ability to cook without poisoning us. 

Annie rested her head against the wall, still curled into herself, and I hopped past her. Harry was looking after her in his own way. The puke bucket wedged between her legs was enough. Keeping my distance, I checked my phone again. 

It was Mom. Unsurprisingly. 

Five missed calls. 

“Mika, PLEASE call me.” The text lit up my screen. “Sweetie, you can't ignore me.”

I started up the stairs, sending a voice note instead. “Hey, Mom, it’s me.”

As I made my way up, I passed Jasper. Roommate number three glanced up from his phone mischievously. Jasper Le Croix: the rich kid with a soul. His hair was the usual tousled mess, falling over amused eyes that were the perfect shade of coffee grounds. 

His outfit was brow-raising; a suit jacket over one of Annie's old BTS shirts and jeans. His skin was glowing, a result of his vigorous self care routine applied every single morning without fail. 

Jasper had to be meeting with his parents. Otherwise, he’d still be in his robe. As well as being an insufferable socialite, he was nosy as hell. He paused to listen, a curious smile tugging at his lips. 

I waved him off, and he laughed. The voice message was getting too long. Mom had a withering attention span. I reached the top of the stairs. 

“Look, I don’t know why you keep calling me and then ignoring my calls. I don't know if there's something wrong with your phone, or—” I could sense Jasper breathing down my neck. 

I ignored him. 

“I keep telling you to use a different app. Texts are buggy. Just use Facebook.”

In the corner of my eye, Jasper was mimicking me, complete with exaggerated hand gestures. When I turned and shook my fist at him in mock warning, he threw up his hands with a grin, mouthing, *“Okay, you win!”*

“Anyway.” I shot him a *look*, and his smile widened. Jasper Le Croix had a shameless fascination with me and my mother butting heads, and inserting himself into *my* family drama. Maybe he was a Le Croix after all. I gestured for him to leave, not-so-subtly threatening his life with a glare. 

But he didn't back down, pretending not to understand me with manic hand gestures. “I've… got to go change,” I said, distracted by his flailing arms. “Call me when you get this, okay?”

I ended the voice note and stuffed my phone in my pocket. Jasper tilted his head, leaning against the wall with his arms folded. 

I often wondered if his obsession stemmed from not having a mother of his own; just a sociopathic father. There was a lot of darkness bubbling beneath the polished façade of the Le Croix family: affairs, secret children, and the never-ending feud over who would inherit the company. Jasper was the heir, after all. 

He, however, had zero interest. Like I said, he was a rarity, a rich kid with a soul. 

A materialist, yes. His closet was an ego-embarrassment. 

The eldest Le Croix held a simmering distaste for his own bloodline, evident in his tonal shift when he was around them. 

Jasper made it very clear he had no intention of inheriting old money. I attempted to side-step him to get past, but he was a six-foot-something roadblock with an impeccable jawline. 

He stood, brow raised, smug as usual as he peered down at me, arms crossed. “Your Mom?”

I rolled my eyes. “My *Mom.*”

“Emancipation!” Annie groaned from the bottom step. 

Jasper grinned. “What she said! Emancipation! The answer to all of our problems.” 

He winked, stepping back to let me through. I was surprised he wasn't demanding I solve a riddle. I darted past him before he could ruffle my hair. But he didn't, already descending down the stairs, back to scrolling through his phone. 

“You need to take your meds, dude,” he said. “You haven't taken them in days.” 

He was right. I had been putting off taking them. 

Shooing Jasper back downstairs, I made a quick stop in the bathroom, or what I liked to call, our swimming pool. The tub took up half the room, a porcelain rectangle resembling a roman bath. Our shower was awkwardly wedged into a corner, where my eye caught mold above the shower head. 

I tried calling Mom one more time as I rifled through the pill cabinet. I grabbed my usual: anti-allergy meds and the headache pills that always made me nauseous. I took them quickly, but another bottle caught my eye: unopened, with my name scrawled in Dr. Adams’s spidery loops. 

I didn’t remember being prescribed them. Still, I took two, as instructed, and washed them down with tap water. I checked my phone sitting on the edge of the faucet. I was sure I’d called Mom, but the call must have cut off. 

I tried again, and to my surprise, she picked up on the first ring. I slumped down, perching myself on the edge of the bathtub. “Finally,” I said, leaning back and crossing my legs. The metallic taste of the pills was creeping back up my throat and sticking to my tongue. “Mom, you really need a new—”

“Mika!” she cried, and something in her voice jolted my thoughts.

Mom was crying.

But Mom never cried.

“Mika, where the hell are you? We’re at the funeral! Oh God, you promised you'd come.”

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine. It was suddenly too cold. I shivered, but that creeping feeling didn't leave, skittering under my skin. A sharp odor crept into my nose, a combination of mold and my own body odor. When I tipped my head back, the mold had spread across the ceiling. The tub was full of cobwebs. 

I stumbled back downstairs. Everything was duller, a thick, hazy mist over my eyes.

“Jasper,” I spoke to the empty hallway, to silence stretching all the way downstairs. 

But he was gone. Annie too, no longer lounged on the bottom step. 

The stink of sour milk followed me, bleeding into my nose and throat. It was stark and wrong, hanging thick and heavy in the air. The living room was dark, windows shut, curtains clumsily drawn. 

In the kitchen, filthy dishes filled the sink. Old takeout cartons and crushed soda cans cluttered the counters. The couch was empty, and the TV was off. Two beer cans sat on the coffee table. One was still full. Unopened. 

“Mika!” Mom cried, her voice fading into the sound of ocean waves. I didn’t realize I had been just… staring, listening to the gentle crash of water against the shore. 

It sounded just like when we went to the beach. I was sitting in the sand, head tilted back, watching the four of us waist-deep in the shallows. Reality hit sharp and cruel, like a needle in my spine. 

I was drowning, being pulled down deeper and deeper, with no anchor to hold me, plunging beneath the glistening surface into nothing. Oblivion. 

I felt myself hit the floor, all of the breath sucked from my lungs, my body weightless, my fingernails clawing at my hair and down my face. My phone was no longer in my hands, but I could still hear Mom screaming at me.

“Mika, where are you? Mika, baby, remember? We’re burying them today—”

I ended the call before she could finish. 

Calmly, I climbed the stairs and stepped into the bathroom. I knelt by the toilet, slid two fingers down my throat, and gagged until the pills came back up, thick, bitter, and clinging to my throat in a sour paste.

Then I sank to my knees, my back against the wall, shut my eyes, and waited. After a while, a voice finally cut through the silence and my ragged breaths. “Why are you passed out on our bathroom floor?”

I let my eyes flicker open. It was too bright. The lights hurt my eyes. Jasper was looming over me, awkwardly crouched to meet my gaze, head inclined. He slowly reached out and prodded me in the cheek. 

“Mika, I'm not peeing with you sitting right there.” 

I stood, my legs unsteady, throat raw and aching. 

“Mika?” Jasper’s voice called after me, louder this time. But I kept walking. 

My heart was aching. The tub was clean again. The mold spreading across the ceiling was gone. I left the bathroom, pulling myself toward the light. Comfort.

Downstairs, I could hear the TV and Harry, his frustration with the game steadily growing. 

Annie sat slumped on the bottom step, her head buried between her knees, groaning. I felt myself sink onto the top stair, the world violently lurching. Jasper dropped down beside me. 

“Do you want to talk?” 

He shuffled closer, his voice surprisingly soft, his head flopping onto my shoulder. Jasper Le Croix was warm. 

“So, what did your mom say?”

In the back of my mind, my phone was buzzing in my pocket. 

I ignored it. 

“Nothing,” I said. “Just mom stuff.”

He hummed. “Oh yeah, Mom stuff is the worst.”

We sat in peaceful silence for a while. I liked the feeling of his chin nestled against my shoulder, his hair prickling my skin. Jasper felt comfortable. Right. I thought he was asleep until his voice cut through the heavy nothing that had begun to envelop me.

“Do you remember when you came to the hospital?”

I did.

The memory hit me hard: I burst through the sliding doors, skin slick with sweat, my heart jammed high in my throat. I slammed my hands on the welcome desk, gasping for air. “Hi, my friends came in about half an hour ago?” I managed to choke out.

The nurse nodded. “Name?”

I opened my mouth to reply, when a voice cut me off. “Relax. Harry's fine.”

I spun around and spotted a familiar face at the vending machine. Jasper Le Croix stood with one hand on his hip, the other jabbing furiously at the Coke button. 

The boy was still wearing his robe, a jacket clumsily thrown over the top. He wasn’t smiling; his face was scrunched in irritation, bottom lip jutting out. He kept trying to feed a dollar into the slot, only for the machine to spit it back out. When a soda can finally came through the flap at the bottom, he ducked, snatching it up. 

“It's just a minor injury,” he said, tossing me a can. Jasper cracked his open, taking a long sip. “Come on. I'll take ya to him.”

Harry’s room was down several staircases, along a winding corridor, and straight past the children’s ward. Hospitals gave me the creeps; Jasper, though, seemed right at home. 

I kept my distance as we walked—him sipping his Coke and me, having already drained mine, desperately searching for a trash can. I sure as hell hadn’t forgotten our awkward, drunken kiss the night before. His slight smirk told me everything I needed to know. 

Oh, he remembered it alright. 

“So, what did he do?” I asked, trying to steer the conversation away from last night. Jasper led me through another set of sliding doors and snorted into his drink. 

“Sliced his finger off trying to cut potatoes.” He shot me a grin. 

Jasper truly loved the macabre. He wasn’t even trying to hide his excitement. “You should’ve seen it! Blood everywhere. Harry was screaming, Annie almost fainted, and I was, like, running around trying to clean it all up.” 

We reached Harry’s room. Through the glass window, I glimpsed my roommate sitting up in bed. Jasper sighed, pushing open the door. “Here he is! The crybaby doofus himself.”

I had to agree with Jasper on something. My crybaby doofus roommate was propped up on pillows, legs crossed, dressed in those paper hospital scrubs, the kind that show your ass. 

Harry Senior had a hefty bandage wrapped around his hand. He kept glancing down at it, like the rest of his fingers were going to magically disappear. 

Annie was slumped in the plastic visitor’s chair, head tipped back, golden hair pinned into a ponytail. It looked like she’d dozed off. 

“Mika,” Harry straightened up, tossing me a sheepish smile that I didn’t return. 

I got the call that my house-mate was in the hospital, ran nearly five blocks, and almost had a heart attack. All for the loss of a finger. “You didn’t have to come,” he said. “They’re discharging me soon.”

His gaze found Jasper. “Where’s my soda?”

Jasper shrugged with a grin. “I gave it to the person who didn't slice off their index.”

“Asshole.”

Glimpsing a trash can, I tossed my Coke and slid into the seat next to Annie. Jasper dropped down beside me. “You’re an idiot,” I told Harry, though I was barely holding back a laugh. “How did you even manage that?”

“He was rushing,” Annie grumbled beside me, her eyes still shut. 

“The dumbass wanted to get back to his game, so he was speed-running peeling potatoes.” She sighed, dropping her head into her lap. 

“I’m living in a house full of lit-er-ral clowns.”

Harry, to my surprise, didn't object. He groaned, burying himself under the covers. 

“You guys can leave now.” 

“Nope!” Jasper propped his legs up on the chair, folding his arms. “We’re staying purely to shame you.”

“I'll call security,” Harry grumbled from underneath the pillows. 

“Oh, you wish. I carried you to the hospital, remember?”

Harry tunneled further under the covers. Pure mole behavior. “Because I was rapidly losing blood!”

“Children,” Annie muttered with an eye roll. She turned to me with a hopeful smile, and something twisted in my gut. I knew exactly what she was going to say. 

“Have you decided about moving yet?” she asked. “We’ve found the cutest house! Jasper and I are viewing it next week!”

The atmosphere in the room noticeably dulled when I took too long to answer.

“It's almost 2000 dollars a month,” I said, my hands growing clammy. “I can't afford it.” I straightened up. “I like where we’re living right now. We don't have to move.”

Annie's voice rose into a quiet shriek. “Wait, are you fucking serious, right now?”

“There's mold everywhere, my bedroom is full of asbestos, and if we’re being honest with ourselves, we should be dead.” Jasper surprised me with a snort next to me. “Mika, that house isn't safe anymore.”

“The tub is crumbling,” Harry mumbled from under the blankets. “We keep getting sick from the mold, and the owner told  us the damper on the fireplace is breaking.”

“I can't afford it,” I said, well aware of my burning cheeks. “Moving out, I mean.”

“I can pay for you,” Jasper said, and something in my chest lurched. Of course he could pay for me. “I'll pay your rent.” He nudged me playfully with his elbow. 

“Relax! I don't expect you to pay it back. You're my friend, Mika.” He jumped up with a grin. “I'm just happy we’re finally going.”

“I’m fine,” I said. I tried to smile, but my heart was breaking. It was getting harder to compose myself. “You don't have to pay for me. I'll stay, and you guys can go.”

Annie stood up. Her eyes pinched around the edges. 

“That's a health risk,” she said, her tone hardening. “We can literally move out right now. So, why are you being so stubborn?”

I bit back the words blistering on my tongue. *Because you're privileged*. 

I wanted to scream it, but I knew I’d regret every syllable. They had no idea, living on a different planet while I pretended I belonged. 

Sure, I could splurge on endless bottomless-brunches and fake a life of luxury, but the truth was cruel: I wasn’t like them. 

*You picked the priciest, luxurious house because price tags don’t exist for you.*

*Annie, you wanted a swimming pool, an en-suite, three bathrooms, and none of it matters.*

*The money is nothing to you, and if you actually cared, you’d have found a place we all loved. One I could afford.*

The words twisted and pricked in my throat, trying to crawl into my mouth. 

I swallowed them bitterly, my chest burning.

But the words followed me all the way back home once Harry was discharged. Weeks later, Annie had signed the new lease. She was already packing. 

Boxes littered our living room. 

“Mika!” She greeted me when I came through the door, jumping over a mountain of her shoes she was piling into a box. “Do you want to help me pack? I still need to pack up your room!” She called after me. 

I made dinner, each syllable sliding under my tongue.

I don't want to move. 

We’re fine here. This is our home. 

Jasper cornered me in the kitchen while Harry and Annie were in the lounge.  

“I really don't mind paying for you, you know,” he said casually, reaching into the refrigerator and grabbing a beer. 

When I tried to ignore him, he gently grasped my wrist, squeezing my hand. 

“Mika,” he murmured. “You don't have to be embarrassed. We’re your friends, and we care about you. Just let me pay the rent.”

I felt stiff and wrong. It was a mistake, I thought dizzily, the words suffocating my mouth as his eyes followed me, warm coffee grounds I felt like I was drowning in every time I caught his gaze. 

*Kissing you was a mistake.* 

*Kissing the heir of a psychopath was a mistake*. 

*Kissing the man I wanted more than anything was a fucking mistake*. 

I swallowed it down, but it just came back up in a sour, watery paste.

“Mika.” His voice softened. I shivered when his hand found my wrist, creeping down my arm, settling at my waist. His smile was warm. He didn’t need to say it. 

We both knew what he was thinking, and I was terrified of it. Still, I let him kiss me, softly and tenderly, gently pressing me against the refrigerator. The kiss was warm. It felt right, his fingers cupping my cheek, turning me toward him. 

I waited for it. Jasper Le Croix was already set to marry a socialite whose name I didn’t even know. 

The wedding was arranged for the summer, just after his twenty-second birthday, when he was expected to take over his father’s company. I found out through a brief phone call with his father. 

His son was taken, he said, and whatever “thing” I had with Jasper was to cease immediately.

Jasper knew this. But instead of telling me the truth, his lips curved into a smirk. 

His breath found my ear, warm and heavy, and then exploded into a childish giggle. 

“Can I tell you a secret?” he murmured, pressing his face into my shoulder. He was leaning on me, the weight of his body nearly sending me off balance. “Dad doesn’t *want* a fucking heir,” Jasper whispered. A shiver crept down my spine. 

His voice twisted, effortlessly bleeding into an eerie imitation of his father. 

“It’s all for show. Dad wants to stay top dog.”

“So.” I whispered. He wasn't the only one keeping secrets. I had my own bombshell. 

But it could wait. 

“So,” He murmured into my shoulder. “You've got nothing to worry about. I'll cut all ties with my family, and we move into a new place far away from them.” He  paused. “It'll be a new start. For all of us.”

I pulled away, my stomach lurching. “I said I don't want to move.”

Jasper pursed his lips and folded his arms. “Annie was right.” He grabbed a beer and headed for the door. 

“You are being stubborn.” He rolled his eyes, lingering in the doorway. “You're moving, Mika. I already paid your deposit. If we have to drag you to our new home, we will.” 

His voice turned sing-song, as he danced back down the hallway. “You *know* we will!”

Pinpricks.

His words jabbed into my spine like tiny needles.

“What?” I said, my voice catching before it rose into a yell.

My cheeks flushed hot. Tears stung my eyes.

“You already paid for me?” I trailed after him through the kitchen and up the stairs. “When I told you not to?”

BANG. 

A sudden deafening THUD splintered my thoughts. I froze, mouth open, breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t scream. Could only watch my roommate's body fall back, plunging down the stairs. 

His head hit each step with a sickening thud, once, twice, three times, four times, with the fifth sending him catapulting backward, his arms flailing, until he crumpled at the bottom. 

For a heartbeat, maybe more, I couldn’t move. Then reality struck. 

I blinked, my mouth full of cotton. “Jasper?”

I dropped to my knees, rolling him onto his back. My hands came away wet, warm, slick with blood. His eyes were still open, unfocused. Blood trickled down his temple. He was still warm. “Jasper.” I said his name like he was still breathing, like he wasn't limp and wrong, tangled in my arms. I didn’t realize I was sobbing until the silence crashed over me like a wave.

“Annie?” I shrieked, her name ripping from my mouth in an animalistic cry. 

“Wait here, okay?” I whispered, cupping Jasper’s face in my hands. He didn't move, his head lolling. “Wait here.” 

My breath caught when more blood came away, soaking my fingers and palms. “Wait. Please just don't move, all right?”

I stood, and my legs buckled. I hit the floor hard. Couldn’t move. Tried to crawl toward the lounge, but my limbs were heavy and wrong, and useless. My eyes fluttered. 

Something was… wrong.

I coughed, choked, rolled onto my side. Slammed my sleeve over my mouth. There was something in the air. I forced myself to my knees. Grabbed Jasper’s ankles and began dragging him toward the front door. There was no air, no oxygen, nothing for me to breathe. 

I opened the door, sucked in gasps of air, and pulled him outside. Then turned back for Annie and Harry. Harry was curled on the floor, surrounded by shards of broken glass. Annie lay crumpled in the hallway.

I screamed for help. Dropped beside them, shaking them. “Wake up.”

I shook them violently, screaming, until Mrs Wayley gently pulled me back.

But they didn’t move. They were so still. So cold.

They were all dead on arrival. I was sitting next to Jasper, my hands squeezed in his, when they called it. 

His lips were blue under a plastic mask, eyes half-open. “Time of death: 8:53pm. Cause: blunt force trauma to the head. Twenty-one-year-old male—” 

Their voices mangled together in my head. They didn’t make sense. I still held his hand, even when it fell limp. 

I still wrapped my arms around him, like he’d sit up and pull me closer. Investigators said it was due to the damper on the fireplace. It broke, and all the oxygen had been sucked from the air. 

Something like that. I wasn't really listening. The therapist prescribed me pills so I'd stop feeling sad. But I didn't want to take them. I wanted to stay with them. 

“It's not your fault, you know,” Jasper’s voice pulled me back to the present, the two of us sitting on the top stair. Annie was gone from the bottom step. Harry’s yells had faded from the lounge. Jasper  stretched his legs, letting out a sigh. 

“I know you blame yourself. That's why you're not letting us go.” he rolled his eyes, shooting me a grin. “You're stubborn, Mika,” he nudged me. “Always have been.”

But I didn't want him to go. 

If I stayed like this forever, sitting on the top stair of our home, I could hold onto them, just a little longer. 

“Okay, but that's not healthy,” Jasper murmured. 

“I know this sounds cliché or whatever, but you've got to move on, dude. Your mom is worried about you, and rightfully so. Why do you keep coming here?” 

When I didn’t respond, he sighed. 

“Take your pills.” Jasper stood up. He didn’t face me. I could see he was already crying, or trying not to cry, and ultimately failing. “You're going to close your eyes, and I'm going to go, all right?” His voice was steady. “No tearful goodbye. No regrets. Because it wasn’t your fault.”

It wasn't my fault. 

Something in the air shifted, almost like the temperature was rising. My phone buzzed again, and I looked down at it. I glanced up, and Jasper was gone. 

“Mom?” my voice broke when I finally answered. 

“Mika.” Mom’s voice was a sob. “Oh, god, where are you? Sweetie, it was a beautiful service. I wish you could have seen it.”

I slowly got to my feet, making my way downstairs. “Yeah, Mom.” I said. “I wish I could have seen it too.”

The words caught on my tongue when I noticed it. So subtle, faded, and yet there in plain sight. I crouched on the bottom step, peering at the smear of red on the wall. The world jerked suddenly, and I was standing on the top of the stairs. 

Jasper was standing in front of me, his eyes wide. “Just let me pay for you,” he said. “I promise you won't have to pay it back.”

“I'm not accepting 50K.” I whispered. 

He tilted his head, lips curving. “Why?” Jasper rolled his eyes. “It's pocket change,” he sighed. “I already paid the deposit for you. Annie finalized the lease.”

Shame slammed into me, ice cold waves threatening to send me to my knees. “You already paid for me?” I managed to choke out. “When I told you not to?”

Jasper shrugged. “Well, yeah. Like I said, it's nothing. Pocket change.” 

He grinned, and it was that smile that set something off inside me. 

I shoved him, not hard enough to throw him down the stairs. Just a push, sending him slightly off balance. 

“You're an asshole,” I spat. 

His lip curled. He was a Le Croix, after all. “Relax. Jeez, Milka, it's like you *want* to be a victim. We’re your friends. We just want to help you, you know? This house is going to kill us.” 

His eyes widened, frantic, suddenly, when he realized what he'd said. “Fuck.” He ran both hands through his hair. “I didn’t mean it like that!”

I saw myself lash out. Arms flying. But more than that. I saw red. Bright, scalding red that blurred the edges of my vision. He dodged, eyes wide, mouth open in a silent cry. “Mika, what are you doing?!”

I grabbed him. My hands clamped around his wrists, and I saw his eyes. Wide and brown, and terrified. And I shoved… hard. He didn't get a chance to cry out, his expression crumpling, eyes flying open. 

I watched his body tumble down the stairs, limbs flailing, catapulting down each step, before landing with a sickening BANG. I stood frozen, chest heaving, heart pounding against my ribs. Annie appeared at the bottom, a frenzy of tangled gold. 

She was carrying a box for her shoes. It slipped out of her hands. 

“Jasper?” Annie shrieked, falling to her knees. Her hands fumbled across his neck, his chest, then flew to her mouth. 

Her eyes met mine. 

“It’s… it's okay,” she whispered, when I didn’t move. “Harry! Harry, call an ambulance!”

Annie scrambled up the stairs, her arms reaching for me. They were warm. Comforting. She held me close, tears soaking into my shoulder. 

“Mika, it’s okay,” she said, her voice splintering. “Jasper’s going to be okay. It was an accident.” Her lips pressed to my ear, breath shuddering. 

“You’re okay.”

I nodded, slowly, dizzily. I was okay, I thought. I was okay. 

My head was spinning. But I saw Jasper’s blood pooling on the floor. I saw his body twisted in tangled knots. 

No. 

I shoved Annie back. 

She didn’t resist, like she already knew. Instead, she clung onto me. 

And then I grabbed her, all of her, wrapping my arms around my best friend, and hurled her tiny body down the stairs. That’s when I saw Harry in the doorway. His eyes wild. His mouth open in a silent cry.

“Harry.”

I stumbled toward him, but my apologies tasted sour. 

“I'm sorry,” I said. 

But was I? 

He didn’t scream, striding into the lounge and grabbing his phone.

“I’m calling an ambulance,” Harry whispered, voice breaking, tears sliding down his cheeks. 

He dialed with shaking fingers. “I need an ambulance for my friends.” he broke down. But the phone screen was black. 

I saw red again. Bright red. Invasive red. Painful red. In two steps, I took the empty glass from the table and smashed it over his head. 

Harry hit the floor without a sound. 

“I’m sorry,” I choked out. 

I dragged his body into the hallway, then lit the fireplace, and shut the flue. 

I waited. Waited for the air to thin, for my breaths to become labored. When my vision started to blur, I pulled them. 

Jasper, Annie, Harry, outside, one by one, laying them out on the patio. 

Jasper was still breathing. His gaze trailed after me, lazy, eyes flickering, as I collapsed beside him on the lawn. I was choking. And then his eyes finally fluttered. 

Once I knew he was dead, I fumbled for my phone with shaking hands. I dialed and held it to my ear. “Mr. Le Croix?” I whispered, choking on thin, poisoned air. 

“I’ve done a bad thing,” I whispered, crawling over to Jasper’s body. “Please help me.”

*“Mika?”*

Mom’s voice brought me back to the present once more. “Sweetie, are you at the house? I'll come and get you, baby.”

“No.”

My voice was choked and wrong. I scrolled through the notifications lighting up my screen. All of them were from PayPal. 

You have received $500.0000 from Simon Le Croix. 

You have received $100.0000 from Simon Le Croix. 

You have received $700.0000 from Simon Le Croix. 

“You *bitch*.”

I glanced up, and there he was, sitting with his knees to his chest, dried blood on his temple and under his nose. 

His head was cocked, eyes narrowed, lips curled in a smile that wasn’t quite a smile, more of an ironic snarl. His gaze followed my finger through every payment his father had sent.

Jasper Le Croix wasn’t a hallucination this time. He wasn’t the man who told me it wasn’t my fault. The ghost I imagined.

The pathetic apparition who held me, told me everything was okay. He snorted, eyes dark, and turned away from my phone. 

But I could feel his anger, like a wave crashing over me. 

Not a hallucination. 

Because Jasper Le Croix would never fucking tell me that. He would never tell me it wasn’t my fault… if it was. 

Annie was back, sitting on the bottom step, blonde curls nestled in her arms. Harry was perched on the middle step, legs stretched out, arms folded, head tipped back like he owned the silence.

The lights flickered and then went out, leaving three figures carved into the darkness. I wasn’t hallucinating my friends anymore. I was seeing them for who they really were, the reality of them bleeding through the gaps. Who I had tried to suppress. Tried to run away from.

And they were *pissed*.",1,1751125554.0,stories,0,1.0,False

So your brain? Yeah, she’s *not* always serving facts. Sometimes she’s literally gaslighting you harder than your ex situationship who said *“we’re not exclusive”* but still rage-reacted when you posted a thirst trap.

This phenomenon has a name: **cognitive distortions**. Aka intrusive mental fanfics that flop every time but you keep doomscrolling through them anyway.

Let’s unpack this unhinged pipeline, shall we?

# 🎭 1. Black-and-White Thinking: The Drama Queen of Thoughts

Your brain loves to give “if it’s not perfect, it’s trash” vibes. Like, *one (1)* mildly awkward social interaction and suddenly you’re like “guess I’m an irredeemable social pariah, might as well move to a forest and live off vibes.”

Babe, no. Life is literally grey area core. Not everything is slay or flop. Sometimes it’s mid — and that’s valid.

# 💣 2. Catastrophizing: Main Character Syndrome But Make It Apocalypse

You lose your keys? Suddenly you’re spiraling: “I’ll get fired, be homeless, my friends will hate me, and I’ll die alone in a ditch.”  
Like girl, chill. Not every minor inconvenience is a lore-ending plot twist.

# 📺 3. Overgeneralization: One Episode ≠ Whole Season

So you bombed a presentation once? Now your brain’s like *“I am bad at everything forever, no spin-off, no redemption arc.”*  
Sweetie, not true. It’s giving *bad faith reboot* energy. Cancel that show.

# 🕵️‍♀️ 4. Mind Reading: Psychic But Wrong

You think you know exactly what everyone thinks about you. Spoiler: You don’t.  
Your coworker didn’t say hi? *“They hate me.”*  
Nah babe, they’re just fighting for their life against IBS or a mental breakdown. Nobody’s clocking your every move.

# 🔍 5. Mental Filtering: Selective Attention Disorder

You get 10 compliments and 1 shady side-eye. Guess which one your brain hyperfixates on? Yeah. Block that negativity. Retweet the good bits.

# 🗑️ 6. Disqualifying the Positive: The Ultimate Self-Drag

Your friend: “You did amazing, bestie!”  
Your brain: “They’re just saying that to be nice, actually I suck.”  
Bestie. Just take the compliment and log off.

# 🔮 7. Fortune Telling: Girl, You’re Not Raven Baxter

You’re out here prophesying disaster: *“This party will suck, they’ll all hate me, I’ll spill a drink on my shirt and have to move to Guam.”*  
Stop manifesting flop energy. Maybe it’ll be iconic. Who knows?

# 🔭 8. Magnification/Minimization: Tiny Win? Ignore. Tiny Fail? Blow It Up Like TNT.

Your brain loves to zoom in on your L’s and crop out your W’s. Normalize humblebragging to yourself, babe. You did good.

# 🫧 9. Emotional Reasoning: Feelings ≠ Facts

Just cuz you *feel* cringe doesn’t mean you *are* cringe. Sometimes you’re just tired and your brain is wearing a clown wig.

# 🖤 10. Nihilistic Thinking: The Emo Era That Won’t Quit

“All is meaningless, nothing matters, I should just rot.”  
No, hun. Some stuff is dumb, but other stuff is cute. Like your friends. Or your cat. Or a good iced coffee. Stay for the little slays.

# 💅 So What Do?

🧹 When you clock these distortions, gently bully your brain back:

* “Is this true or am I fanficcing drama again?”
* “Am I ignoring receipts?”
* “Can I not? Just for today?”

Treat your intrusive thoughts like a flop stan account — block, mute, move on.

Your brain can be a messy gay icon *and* your worst hater. Give her grace but don’t let her soft-launch you into a spiral.

Anyway. Drink water. Touch grass. Tell your brain to log off for a bit.

I arrived to the office at my usual time and was making coffee in the kitchen, hadn't even logged in and checked my emails so I had no idea what was going on. My boss suddenly comes up to me and screams ""WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WHY HAVENT YOU ANSWERED MY EMAIL ARE YOU READY FOR THIS MEETING?"" The other people in the kitchen looked at him like he had gone completely nuts. 

I explained that I didn't know what he's talking about as I just arrived. He then started arguing that it's my responsibility to check my emails on my way to work since I take public transit. He was fuming and said we have to get something ready, whatever we can in the next 10 minutes. I asked if this was such an emergency why didn't he call me and he just ignored what I said and repeated I need to focus now not argue with him. 

I log into the work system at around 855am and realize what he's asking for is hours of work. He wants me to aggregate large amounts of data and then write high level insights for the VP we are about to meet. Of course there is no time to do any of this so we leave to go to the meeting room to get there by 9am. The VP arrives 20 minutes late because his train was late, talks for 5 minutes and then ends the meeting. Me or my boss never say a word and we are never asked about the insights he was panicking over. 

My boss never apologies and completely ignored me for the remainder of the week. Thankfully he left our department about a month later so I never had to deal with him again. ",78,1751124893.0,antiwork,6,0.99,False
1lmpmuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lmpmuj/fighter_by_tijan_that_was_the_other_part_of_being/,"Fighter by Tijan: That was the other part of being female that sucked: my speed had evaporated. I could no longer race and tackle him to the ground. I’d enjoyed holding my own against my brothers, but that had stopped, and by freshman year they were too cool to even be associated with me............","Go, Dale!” my brother Dylan shouted in my ear. He raced from his side of the truck while I was still putting the engine in park. “Come on!” I heard him yell as he went past my door and veered to the back of the house.  
  
  I loved all nine of my brothers, but I was not one of them. For one thing, I’m a girl. My real name is Delia Holden. Our mom decided to give me the family name, but that’s the most feminine thing about me. Delia had been shortened to Dele early on, and somehow that switched to Dale when I was in junior high. Which suited me fine. At that time, I liked fitting in with my brothers. I was scrawny enough to wear baggy shirts, baseball hats, and jeans with sneakers. People thought I was a boy, and I was athletic enough to play sports with most of the guys. That ended around eighth grade. My boobs came in, and my hips went out. Even though I was still thin, there was no way to hide my female lioness anymore.  
  
  I hated this, and watching Dylan sprint away, I cursed at him. That was the other part of being female that sucked: my speed had evaporated. I could no longer race and tackle him to the ground. I’d enjoyed holding my own against my brothers, but that had stopped, and by freshman year they were too cool to even be associated with me. They’d come around eventually as we all grew up, but things were never quite the same. Now here I was, home for the holidays from my first year at college, and I’d been roped back into the bounty-hunting business.  
  
  Our mom died from cancer when I was little, and our dad died when I was in high school. My mother had been sweet, quiet, and the perfect doting mom—a pile of crocheted doilies made for each kid testified to that fact. She really was perfect. Home-cooked meals, and she had picture books for each of us. I have memories of her waving goodbye from the window as the bus picked us up for school. However, our dad was the opposite. He was technically murdered in the back alley of a bar, but the real cause of his death was a lifetime of boozing, bar fights, and gambling gone wrong.  
  
  The social workers tried to take us into the system, but Dean was already nineteen then. He refused and instead got a job at a local bounty-hunting firm. Fast forward ten years and he owned the business. Every one of our brothers now worked as agents. The only black sheep in the family was me. I went to college, and it was moments like this that I was glad. No six a.m. busts. No accidentally Maceing myself. No worrying if my Taser had the lock on it.  
  
  I cursed under my breath, scrambling to tuck the keys into my pants and zip up the pocket as I tried to hold my gun so it wasn’t pointed at anyone. Honestly. I’d been gone for five months. Five months of normalcy. Five months of staying up late to eat pizza and drink beer. Five months of going on dates. Five months of doing what other college students did, and I would bet money my friends weren’t home chasing after a bail jumper. Oh, no. They weren’t worried about whether they’d remembered to grab their handcuffs or not.  
  
  “Dale!”  
  
  Another brother waited at the other end of the house. He waved me over. As I ran to him, already feeling short of breath, he gestured to the south corner. “Radio when you get there.”  
  
  Radio?  
  
  Shit. I forgot my damn radio. I glanced at him. Would he have an extra? Did I dare ask and risk being chewed out? Judging by the firm set of his jaw, I decided no. My cousins and brothers were nuts when it came to this stuff. If you forgot a piece of equipment, you got scrub duty at the end of the night.  
  
  I ran around to the backyard and saw Dylan in the opposite corner of the yard. He was looking all around with a hand to his radio. I heard him say, “South right side clear.”  
  
  My cousin added, “Left front clear.”  
  
  The rest checked in, and I heard Dean, my oldest brother, yelling from the front. “Where is he? We know he’s here!”  
  
  “Dale!” Dylan waved his arms. He cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, “Check in! What’s wrong with you?”  
  
  What was wrong with me? Oh, the fact that they woke me at up six in the morning might’ve had something to do with it. Or that I hadn’t worked out since I got on the airplane heading from California to Chicago back in August. Or the fact that I didn’t want to do this, and they’d just assumed I would jump at the chance. I wanted to scream back at him and give him the middle finger, but instead I did my job: scan the windows, look for anyone looking back, look for any movement in the curtains. Look for pretty much anything. When I saw nothing, I yelled back at him, “I’m clear.”  
  
  He lifted his radio and waved it at me. “Check in.”  
  
  Across his radio, I heard, “Dale, check in. Check in, Dale.”  
  
  I had no fucking radio.  
  
  “Dale!”  
  
  That was it. I gave him the middle finger this time.  
  
  He groaned in frustration, but checked in for me. “South left side clear.” He paused, then added, “Dale’s an asshole.”  
  
  I lifted my finger higher above my head.  
  
  He laughed, but then our drama was forgotten. We heard Dean’s voice from the front side of the house: “I don’t care what rights you think you have. We have a warrant, motherfucker. Let us in. Now!”  
  
  I grinned, shaking my head. Memories of my childhood rolled back over me, and I adjusted my stance, leaning most of my weight on my left leg as I got comfortable. My job was to watch and report anything. My brother Dean’s job was to roust the bail jumper, and as he continued to yell at whoever had been unlucky enough to answer the door, he was doing it to perfection.  
  
  I waved at Dylan and cupped my hands around my mouth to yell at him, “Who’s the jumper?”  
  
  His hands immediately shot up in the air. “You didn’t read the file?”  
  
  I’d been focused on dressing, coffee, brushing my teeth, coffee, finding my shoes, coffee, and then fixing my hair. They were lucky I remembered to grab a bulletproof vest. I shrugged.  
  
  A litany of curse words left him. “Are you kidding me?!”  
  
  I waited. He’d break. He’d tell me, acting like he was super disappointed. But I knew Dylan. He’d forget about this the instant we actually got the guy. Anyway I still had my fingers crossed, hoping the radio incident wouldn’t be remembered later. I could grab a radio back at the office…hopefully before anyone remembered to confront me about it.  
  
  He swore again, but shouted back, “Your ex.”  
  
  My what? I looked back at the house. Not recognizing it, I asked, “Which one?”  
  
  Then a curtain moved, and I saw him. Holy fucking hell.  
  
  Dylan yelled, “Jaxon,” but he didn’t need to. I stared right into the piercing brown eyes of the one ex-boyfriend I’d hoped to never see again in my life.  
  
  Shit!  
  
  His brown hair was shaved into a crew cut, but it made him even more mouth-wateringly attractive. As I watched him look around, saw how the shadows played across his chiseled cheekbones and those perfect lips, I knew I could testify to exactly how they could be used. I thought the fucker went to New York to pursue a modeling career. What was he doing back? And why was he the bail jumper? Well…okay. I wasn’t that surprised by that last part.  
  
  Then he saw me too, and I felt whiplash from the sting. His eyes narrowed. He stood there shirtless, his lean physique perfectly molded and sculpted. A smirk appeared, and I could read his thoughts. He was thinking of running for it.  
  
  My groin ached already. Jaxon was the guy I’d had to quit. For real. I had to quit him. He was an addiction, and he got me into trouble, rather than keeping me out of it. My brothers hated him, but oh god…my eyes trailed down his chest again, and I remembered all the reasons I’d stopped listening to them.  
  
  He leaned back, brought up his foot, and my hand went to grab my radio. It grabbed my shoulder instead. Crap. This was why I should’ve swallowed my pride and asked for an extra. He was really going to run, and Dylan was looking the other way.  
  
  “No!” I yelled.  
  
  Jaxon flashed me  
a grin. Good lord, he was gorgeous. He flung himself out the window, and I stopped admiring his perfect dimples.  
  
  I looked to see if Dylan had heard me. He hadn’t. His ear was pressed to his radio, and I heard buzz coming from the other side of the house. Then he took off, disappearing around the side.  
  
  “Dylan!”  
  
  He didn’t stop.  
  
  Jaxon had landed in a roll and was up on his feet. He looked like a damn cat. The athleticism in one of his pinkies equaled all of mine (even in good shape) and half my brothers’. We were screwed.  
  
  He dashed past me and laughed. “Looks like you’re going to have to tackle me, Doily. It’s just you and me.” He didn’t wait around, though. He turned and soared into the woods behind the house.  
  
  For a moment, just one moment, I was mesmerized by the image of his ass. He wore black cargo pants, and they molded to his backside. It’d been too long since I had some of that fun. Then I remembered what I was supposed to be doing, and I tore after him.  
  
  I screamed over my shoulder, “Runner!” I wasn’t holding my breath for help, and, gritting my teeth, I really was going to try to get him, just for the enjoyment of tackling him underneath me one more time.  
  
  Five minutes later, I realized I had no shot of getting him. My lungs protested, threatening to shut off completely if I didn’t slow down, and my legs weren’t helping. It was like they’d forgotten how to run. I almost pitched to the side twice, and my knees wanted to buckle, but in the end a log was my demise. I was running, or still trying—I was wheezing so loud that if I’d had a radio, I wouldn’t have been to talk into it—when I saw the log. I jumped over it and was airborne when I saw the second log.  
  
  I screamed as my foot hit the log and my ankle went one way while I went the other. I crumpled to the ground.  
  
  Searing pain flared all over me, making my insides feel like they were burning up. I clutched my ankle and pressed down. My brothers always said to stop the swelling. I’d never read the bounty-hunting first aid manual to understand why swelling was bad, but I held my ankle like it was a life preserver. As I bit my lip and rocked back and forth, the rest of me tried not to let loose the water works. I was a girl, but fuck, I couldn’t act like a girl. No crying, or I’d hear about this moment twenty years from now.  
  
  “Doily.”  
  
  I glanced up. Jaxon had come back. He’d stopped a few feet away and watched me warily. Sweat ran down his chest, and he rested his hands on his hips. His pants slipped down, showing the V his muscles formed as they dipped beneath his waistband. As he knelt, his stomach muscles clenched even more tightly together.  
  
  I wanted to scream again. He looked so damn beautiful, and here I was. Sweaty. I felt my face and looked at the blood on my fingers. My hair was probably a mess, and I wore a pink tank top underneath my vest. It would’ve been hot, if the bottom wasn’t disintegrated into shattered ends. Looking down at my jeans, I saw a big hole had ripped, and horror filled me as I followed the rip from beginning to end. Yep. It began at my knee and ended at my crotch.  
  
  Jaxon hadn’t knelt to look at my ankle. He was staring right at my bright orange thong underwear.  
  
  “Stop.” I groaned. Bending down so my forehead pressed to my leg, I thought maybe he’d go away.  
  
  His low, smooth chuckle rippled over me, sending old sensations and tingles through me too. He stood and came closer. Stopping so he was out of reach, he asked, “No radio, huh?”  
  
  I snarled at him, “Go away.”  
  
  “You’re supposed to trick me into getting close. Then you put those handcuffs on me. Remember?” He nudged my leg with his foot. It was a gentle touch, but I gasped. This hurt.  
  
  He bent down so he could actually look at my ankle this time. “That’s how we used to have fun, remember? Hmmm…it doesn’t look broken. Ice it and you’ll be fine by tonight.”  
  
  “What’d you do, anyways?”  
  
  His light, flirty look disappeared. He grew serious and stepped away again. “I can’t tell you that, my little Doily.”  
  
  I hated that name.  
  
  “And since you’re not going to die, I’m going to complete my escape now.”  
  
  “Jaxon.” I looked at him, pleading now. “You can’t leave me like this. Carry me back. They’re probably still searching that house. They won’t even think to come look for me.”  
  
  He shrugged. “That’s your problem. And they’ll look for you.”  
  
  At that second, we heard shouts behind us, and a wide grin came over his face. “See? You’re the baby girl. They’ll always look out for you.”  
  
  “Jaxon, for real. What’d you do? I can help you.” I needed to stall. Shoving the pain down and out of my mind, I focused on him. Bringing him in would prevent a lot of the teasing I knew I was otherwise going to endure. Come closer, a little closer. I started to wedge out my handcuffs from my waist and opened them. One quick flick of my wrist and I might be able to get them on his foot. Maybe. Using my fingers, and holding my arm in place to shield them, I started to slide the handcuffs wider.  
  
  He laughed. “I don’t think so, sweet cheeks. Listen, I’ll turn myself in after this weekend. I promise.”  
  
  “Why not now? What’s so important—” But even as I spoke, I knew. “Oh no.”  
  
  He’d been watching me. As I connected the dots, his smirk grew. “Yeah. Sorry.”  
  
  “You’re fighting again?”  
  
  “I gotta make money somehow. I’m in the Boxing Day match this weekend.”  
  
  I groaned, rolling my eyes. “We’re not in Canada. We don’t have Boxing Day.”  
  
  He laughed, his top lip curved up in an adorable way, and began walking backward. He lifted a hand to wave. “Still. I’ll see you this weekend. I’ll even come to your bedroom so you can get the jump. How’s that?”  
  
  He had a wicked glint in his eyes, but I knew he would follow through as promised. I also knew that meant we wouldn’t be catching him until then. He was going underground, and we might not be able to find him until he was ready to be found.  
  
  “Dale!”  
  
  Dylan’s voice came from back down the path. I looked over my shoulder, but he wasn’t within view yet. “I’m here!” I yelled.  
  
  When I turned back, Jaxon was gone.  
  
  I sat on the couch with six bags of ice all around my ankle. I only needed one, but nope, my brothers thought it was hilarious to make the pile as high as it could be. Dylan wanted to see if he could get it all the way to the ceiling, but Dean yelled at him for using too many ice packs. However, when I tried removing them, they just laughed and brought them back. I’d managed to wedge a blanket between some of the ice packs so there was only one actually on my ankle. I used the other ice packs to hide the blanket, so it was a win-win. My brothers kept laughing at me, my leg stuck under a house of ice bags, but I was secretly laughing at them.  
  
  Dumb shits.  
  
  It was either this or be harassed because I went into the field without a radio. Really. I knew better. The only one who was actually angry at me was Dean, but he was pissed because I hadn’t used my feminine wiles on Jaxon. But hello? It’s Jaxon. He’s not exactly dumb—not like my brothers.  
  
  That evening around nine, someone shouted, and four of my brothers sprinted past the door to the back of the house. When I heard the office door slam shut and car doors open, I pushed myself upright.  
  
  Dylan sprinted past, or tried to. He held a coffee cup, so he could only jog or it would spill.  
  
  “Hey!” I yelled.  
  
  He jerked, and the coffee spilled on his arm. He turned to me with a scowl. “What the eff, Dale? I have coffee here.”  
  
  “I have a question here.”  
  
  He growled at me and looked around. When evidently he didn’t see what he wanted, he used the bottom of his shirt to wipe off some of the coffee. “Yeah? What do you want? You got me while I clean up. Then I’m out of here.”  
  
  “Where’s everyone going?”  
  
  “Oh.” The growl left him, and he started laughing. “You were had, little sister.”  
  
  “What’re you talking about?  
”  
  
  “The Boxing Day fight. Your boy lied to you.”  
  
  “He’s not my boy, and how do you know?” I wasn’t surprised to hear Jaxon had lied. That was another factor in our breakup.  
  
  “We got a tip. He’s fighting tonight, not on Boxing Day—although he could be fighting then too. But yeah.” He finished cleaning up the coffee and frowned at his flannel shirt. Putting his coffee cup on the counter, he decided the shirt had to go. He tossed it on a chair and pulled off his white tee shirt, which had absorbed most of the coffee.  
  
  “Oh my,” came a voice from the doorway.  
  
  There, holding onto the doorframe with her mouth formed in an O and her eyes traveling slowly down my brother’s body, was my best friend. While I had straight, dark brown hair, Haley had blond curly hair. Almond eyes, tiny little lips, freckles sprinkled over her complexion—she was cute and gorgeous all at once. She had a small frame, boobs she wished were bigger, and slender hips, and she wasn’t the only one drooling. Dylan’s eyes were glued to her. No. Correction: they were glued to her rack.  
  
  I motioned to her. “Haley.”  
  
  She didn’t answer. She completed her first scan, arriving at his feet, and started back up.  
  
  “Haley.

  
She held a hand up. “Hold on. Girl’s working here.”  
  
  Realizing he was a fine specimen, my brother moved as if he were in slow motion. He started to reach for his flannel shirt, flexing his arm muscles, then turned his arm so his shoulder muscle bulged. The pectorals were next, and last, as he grabbed his shirt, he made sure to suck in his breath and twist to the side so his abdominal muscles were as cut as possible.  
  
  It could’ve been a scene out of a sitcom, as Haley wasn’t even trying to hide her reaction. She held a latte in her hand, and while she drank in the sight of my brother, her hand lifted the lid. She let it fall to the floor as she dipped her fingers into the cup, then wiped them at the corner of her mouth.  
  
  She was foaming. I got it.  
  
  A second later, she glanced at me, biting down on her lip and trying to hold back her laughter. She pointed to herself. “Get it?”  
  
  I rolled my eyes. “He’s my brother. You’re disgusting.”  
  
  Dylan realized his Magic Mike moment was over and chuckled, buttoning up his flannel shirt at a faster pace. He gestured to the cup she was holding. “What’s that?”  
  
  “A latte.”  
  
  He narrowed his eyes and pressed his lips together. He started for her, but she held it back and circled the room to me. “It’s for your sister.”  
  
  As she gave it me, I beamed. “Finally. The best friend has arrived.”  
  
  She rolled her eyes, making a tsking sound, and perched at the side of the couch. Then she studied the mound of ice packs. “Uh, is that good for you?”  
  
  Dylan barked out a laugh, slapping his leg. “That’s what she gets for not taking a radio out into the field.”  
  
  Haley frowned at him. “What? She gets ice-packed to death?”  
  
  He stopped laughing. “What?”  
  
  “They said Jaxon is fighting tonight,” I told Haley. “Do you know where?”  
  
  She looked back at me with an incredulous look.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Has college sucked all the intelligent cells out of you? It’s Christmas Eve…” She waited, her eyebrows rising higher and higher. Then she made a circling motion in the air. “Come on…”  
  
  Christmas Eve. Fighting. Jaxon.  
  
  It hit me, and I fell back down against the couch. “Fuck me.” Jaxon was fighting at Sally’s, a hick bar known for their underground fighting matches. They always had a three-day tournament, starting Christmas Eve and ending on Boxing Day.  
  
  “Uh…” Haley tilted her head to the side. “I think he actually did that one time right there.”  
  
  “What?” Dylan looked back and forth between us. He’d grabbed his coffee cup and now reached for mine.  
  
  I pulled it to my chest, shooting him a dark look. “Back off.”  
  
  He rolled his eyes. “Whatever.”  
  
  A honking came from outside, and he waved at them through the window. “I gotta go. See you later, and you’d better get all dressed and pretty. You’re going to be seeing your boy later tonight.” He gave us both a cocky smirk as he left, using his back to push open the door.  
  
  The second it closed, Haley turned to me. “Tell me you want to go too.”  
  
  “Hell, yes.”  
  
  We started knocking the ice packs off my leg. When she saw the blanket, Haley grinned and shook her head, but didn’t say a word. When all of them were gone, she took one of my hands, and I pushed up from the couch with the other. Here was the testing moment: could I put weight on my leg or not? I would have to be able to walk.  
  
  Holding my breath and my latte, I started standing up. Nope. Daggers of pain shot up my leg, and I cried out. No way. I couldn’t walk. “Great,” I muttered. The pain almost made me drop my coffee. That would be a cold day in hell. Coffee came before everything. “Now what am I going to do?”  
  
  Haley thought, then her eyes lit up. She let go of my hand, and I barely caught myself as I fell back to the couch. I screamed at the sudden rush of more pain.  
  
  “Oh.” She grimaced. “Sorry about that. But wait…” She ran upstairs, then downstairs, giving me a thumbs-up as she passed the living room. She threw open the basement door, and I heard her going down. She reappeared empty-handed and paused in the doorway to the living room. She scratched the top of her head, then her hand jerked up again. “I got it!” She sprinted back out through the kitchen, and I twisted around so I could see through the window. She was heading for the shed.  
  
  A second later, the big door for the shed opened, and she came back out, pushing my worst nightmare.  
  
  “Fuck me,” I muttered.  
  
  She grinned brightly and waved her arms toward her find. “Voila. A wheelchair!”  
  
  Yep. This was my life. I was going to hunt down my ex-boyfriend in a wheelchair. This had to be a bounty hunter’s most embarrassing moment. I mustered a weak smile and gave her a thumbs-up back.  
  
  She clapped and waved her hands in the air. “This will be fun! I want to wear a bulletproof vest.”  
  
  In the end¸ both of us wore bulletproof vests and sunglasses. As Haley pushed my wheelchair up to the handicapped entrance, my elbow rested on my lap, and my hand held my stun gun.  
  
  Yes. We were badass.  
  
  Then Haley tripped, and my wheelchair bumped into the rail, hitting my hand, and I dropped the stun gun in my lap. I froze, pure terror going through me, but it didn’t go off. Haley stifled a scream as I turned and smacked her.  
  
  She yelped, cradling her arm. “Ouch.”  
  
  “I could’ve stunned myself.”  
  
  She nodded, and a laugh slipped from her lips. “Well, you’re already in a wheelchair.”  
  
  I glared at her. “We had another one in the shed.” I raised the stun gun and pointed it at her.  
  
  She kept laughing and rolled her eyes. “Whatever. Be all menacing. I know you have a mushy heart, and besides, if you stunned me, who’d bring you coffee in the morning?”  
  
  I snorted. “You’re not going to. What are you talking about?”  
  
  “That’s true.” Then, still laughing, she straightened the chair and started up the ramp again. Once we got to the door, we formed our own line. The other line of able-bodied patrons spread down the entrance and out onto the sidewalk. The ones waiting close enough to the door watched us the entire time. Some had their hands covering their mouths, laughing, but others glared. If we got in like this, I had no doubt they were going to rebel.  
  
  The bouncer turned to us, and I smiled, lifting my stun gun. “Let us in, Ace.”  
  
  It was my cousin. He was large and in charge, and dressed all in black, except for the white lettering across his chest that said STAFF. Between his sunglasses, bald head, and tattoo circling his neck and trailing up the back of his skull, he would’ve terrified most people. Not me. He was just a year older than me, even though he looked thirty, and I had enough dirt on him to know he had a healthy fear of his mother. The knowledge I could share with her would be my blackmail.  
  
  “You have a weapon,” he pointed out. “No way, Dale. Besides, your brothers are already here, and I have strict instructions not to let you in.”  
  
  I pointed the stun gun at him. “Still have those strict instructions?”  
  
  He grumbled, but he knew I would do it. It didn’t matter where we were or that my escape would’ve reminisced a tortoise trying to flee the scene.  
  
  He shook his head. “Fine. Whatever.” He held open the door, and as we started in, he grumbled, “You got in through the back door, okay? Ted’s back there, and he’s wasted. If they ask him, he’ll probably be convinced you actually did get in through there.” He stopped talking as Haley brushed against his arm.  
  
  She smiled at him, slow and seductive. “Nice and large,” she said as she dropped her gaze. “I wonder what else is nice and large.”  
  
  He stood upright and fought not to smile back. Still wearing his shades, he scanned her up and down. “Still with that Carl guy, Haley?”  
  
  She tilted her head and trailed a hand down his chest. “We ended things last Friday.”  
  
  “So you’re living free and fun now?”  
  
   
; She winked at him. “How’d you know the names of my two girls?” She jiggled her chest, making her breasts sway. Then, continuing to laugh, she pushed my wheelchair forward. “Let me know if you’ve got some free time. I’ll arrange an introduction.”  
  
  He grunted, his eyes trained solely on her backside now. “Will do. Will do.”  
  
  Once we were inside, I twisted around, frowning. “Who’s Carl? I thought it was Clint.”  
  
  “It was, but your cousin can call my ex any name he wants. I forgot how delicious he is.”  
  
  “My cousin or my brother?”  
  
  “Oh.” She pretended to swat at my head. “I’m single. Clint’s been pretending he was single for the last two years, so I’m doing the same thing now. I have every intention of flirting with all hot male specimens who cross my path. Whether I hook up or not is up to me.” She made a clicking sound from the corner of her mouth and winked at me. “Now, let’s go find you some of your own fun and freedom, huh? Where’s that hot piece of ass I know you’re drooling to see fight again?”  
  
  I scowled at her, but I couldn’t ignore the little burst of sensation that shot through me. A tingle of excitement. She was right. It’d been too long since I saw Jaxon fighting, and when she wheeled me around a group of people to an open space where we could see the fighting ring, I got a view that lit my groin on fire.  
  
  Holy. Shit.  
  
  Jaxon was already in the ring, clad only in black shorts that hung low over his slim hips. As his opponent swung at him, he dodged, and every muscle in his backside contracted, showcasing themselves for my viewing pleasure. Stepping forward, he twisted to the side and brought an uppercut, ramming underneath his opponent’s chin. As he did, the rest of my lady parts jerked awake. I got a view of his front then, and his stomach muscles were just as ripped and sculpted as his backside. They were also red and bruised. He’d already taken a beating. I wasn’t surprised. His opponent was twice his size.  
  
  Wearing a mean-looking scowl, his opponent stumbled back a few steps, then grabbed the rope to steady himself. The crowd was going nuts, and Jaxon didn’t hesitate. He followed the larger man, delivering a series of jabs and uppercuts, from which his opponent couldn’t recover. He fell to a knee, and Jaxon backed up, but he shifted on his feet, and I knew what was next: He sprang up, flicking his knee forward and bringing his foot down on top of the guy’s head.  
  
  It was done after that. His opponent fell to the floor in a sprawl, and when the referee lifted his hand and let it go, it landed with a thump. He was out.  
  
  This was an automatic win, and the crowd roared in approval. Jaxon raked his taped hands over his face, spreading blood from his knuckles. I also saw a cut at the top of his eye seeping blood. He might’ve made it worse, but he didn’t seem to care. A cocky smirk covered his face as he turned to his corner. One of the guys waiting there helped him climb out of the ring.  
  
  “Again! Again!” The crowd started to chant, raising fisted hands in the air.  
  
  Jaxon lifted his head, his smirk growing, and turned back to the ring. His fallen opponent was being carried off, and another guy had jumped in. This one was leaner than the first but wore another ugly scowl. He began bouncing up and down, stretching his arms over his chest, and he waved a finger at Jaxon, beckoning him into the ring.  
  
  I recognized this guy. It was Downtown Sculley. He was known in the underground scene. I wheeled my chair forward and leaned closer to see the gleam appear in Jax’s eyes. If he beat Downtown Sculley, his reputation would be cemented. It would up his credibility, and he could demand more money with each fight he won.  
  
  “No, no,” I murmured to myself. I didn’t know if Jax could win, and I didn’t want to find out. He was awake and conscious. If he got knocked out, my brothers would get him and therefore get the skip money. Jax was my jump, more out of pride than anything else. I’d screwed up, so I needed to bring him in. I grabbed Haley’s arm and yanked her down to me.  
  
  “Ouch!” She glared at me. “What?”  
  
  “He can’t fight that guy.”  
  
  “Why?” She glanced around. The crowd was still chanting because Jaxon hadn’t climbed back into the ring yet. But I knew he would. “If he loses, we can grab him easier.”  
  
  “No.” I shook my head. “My brothers will grab him. We need to get him now.”  
  
  “How?” She kept frowning. “I don’t think he’ll even see us—or hear us if we yell.”  
  
  I bit on my lip. She was right. Think, Dale, think! How could I get his attention? As if answering my own question, the throbbing between my legs deepened, and I squirmed in the chair. I needed to decide whether I wanted his attention to take him to jail or because I needed some other release.  
  
  I gestured for Haley to bend down. “Where’s the closest fire alarm?” I asked.  
  
  “Uh…” She scanned the room, which was filled with Christmas lights. A palm tree decorated with condoms and thongs stood in one corner, and mistletoe hung all over. A waitress walked by with her red shirt knotted underneath her breasts, and I noticed she had a necklace of mistletoe around her neck. She saw us, stopped, and frowned with one hand resting on her hip. She wore a very short pleated green skirt, and she cocked her head to the side.  
  
  I met her gaze. I knew she was wondering whether we should be here or not, so I smiled at her and lifted my stun gun. Her eyes went wide, and she hurried away.  
  
  Hayley groaned. “Why did you do that?”  
  
  That waitress had been eyeing Jaxon earlier. I shrugged. I should’ve hidden the gun, but I couldn’t refrain. Seeing the fear in her eyes had been worth it.  
  
  “She’s getting security.”  
  
  “Well, that seals the deal,” I said as I saw what we’d been looking for. I pointed to the fire alarm. “Go pull it.”  
  
  Just then a guy turned around right in front of it, and we both stopped. It was my brother Dylan. He laughed, holding a beer in one hand and talking to a customer.  
  
  “Thought you guys didn’t drink on the job.” Haley said, eyeing him.  
  
  “We don’t.” But some of us did our own thing. Hello. In a wheelchair here. “Haley, you can still go over and pull it. Go to the side like you’re going to the bathroom and slide behind him.”  
  
  Dylan tipped his head back, taking a good sip from his beer, and his eyes fell on the ass of a girl in front of him. She danced to the music and looked over her shoulder, catching his eye. Giving him a shy smile, she slowed and moved closer.  
  
  “Oh, yeah. He definitely won’t see you—” I began.  
  
  I stopped talking. It was pointless. Haley was already halfway across the room, but she wasn’t hiding. Oh no. She swayed her hips from side to side, and it didn’t take a genius to figure out she was trying to get Dylan’s attention. When he saw her, his eyes widened, but then he frowned and started looking around for me. Haley blocked him. She lifted her arms, pretending to yawn, and as she did, her shirt raised an inch, and Dylan’s eyes went right where she wanted them: to Fun and Free themselves. She had her back to me, but I could tell whatever she was doing was working. My brother looked entranced.  
  
  Stopping right in front of him, Haley hip checked the other girl and drew her finger along my brother’s neck, moving up to the tip of his chin. She lifted his head, curling her other arm around his shoulder, and then—Was she really? Yep.—she pressed her lips to his.  
  
  I was shocked, but only slightly. Haley and Dylan had flirted for years. I waited to see if I should be disgusted. I felt a surge of joy when my brother grabbed her hip and pulled her close against him (not that part—that part was gross). Her arm lifted behind him, reaching for the fire alarm. As she deepened the kiss, her right hand wound around his head and grabbed his hair, then her left finger lifted the handle for the alarm and lingered on the lever.  
  
  I still needed to get in place. She was giving me time.  
  
  I didn’t waste it. Sally’s had three exits: one through the kitchen, a second back by the restrooms, and a third to the left, hidden behind the stage where the deejay had set up that night. Everyone would clamber for the re  
stroom exit and the deejay exit. Knowing Jax, I figured he’d go through the kitchen. There would be the least resistance there since a lot of the customers didn’t know about that one, so I started wheeling. I intended to block him and slap my handcuffs on him. I just had to get there first.  
  
  I wheeled past the main bar and was almost to the kitchen entrance. I ignored the attention I received and glanced back to where Haley was still kissing Dylan. Oh whoa. He had her pressed against the wall now, right beside the fire alarm. Both of her hands were twisted in his hair, but she was looking for me. Our gazes collided, and she shoved my brother away for a split second. Taking a deep breath, she pushed down the alarm and grabbed his hand.  
  
  The sound split through the air a second later, along with flashing lights from every alarm in the bar.  
  
  There was pandemonium after that. If the alarms were going off, that meant the fire station had been alerted, and that meant the police too. People pushed to get out. The underground fighting........

I don't know about you, but Saturdays have become sacred to me - that one day where maybe, just maybe, the phone doesn't ring with an emergency.

Spent this morning doing absolutely nothing productive and it felt amazing. Sometimes we forget that rest isn't selfish, it's necessary. You can't keep running on empty and expect to show up for everyone else.

**This week felt like a lot:** medication mix-ups, insurance calls that went nowhere, and that fun moment when you realize you've been surviving on coffee and whatever was left in the fridge. Anyone else feel like they're just making it up as they go along?

**But there were good moments too.** Those little wins that remind you why this matters. Maybe it was a good day, a genuine laugh, or just getting through a doctor's appointment without drama.

**Weekend plans:** Trying to recharge before Monday hits again. Maybe meal prep so next week isn't quite so chaotic. Definitely ignoring my phone for a few hours.

**How do you reset on weekends?** What helps you gear up for another week? And please tell me I'm not the only one who considers staying in pajamas until noon a valid Saturday activity.

The corner near the logo is the worst area of the pad. I took this picture after gently rubbing the corner with two fingers. It feels constantly damp and the surface is pliable. This became an issue within two weeks of owning the pad, and now other areas get little spots of glue that take forever to clean.

1lmpk6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1lmpk6z/does_coincidences_trigger_psychosis_in_vulnerable/,Does coincidences trigger psychosis in vulnerable people?,"I am 19m, here is my story:

When I was 17, I suddenly started to notice the number 4:44, but the only place I would see it is on the treadmill, so I used to rationalize that at 4 minutes 44 seconds into my run, I would run out of oxygen and need to check the timer, and the body is like machinery so it’s exactly 4:44 every time.

This continued for 6 months until right about I turned 18, I saw 444 at two other places, at the bakery I worked, they were suddenly having a promotion, a slice of cheesecake and a small coffee for 4.44, and on the worksheet my summer school (I failed English) teacher printed me “printed at 4:44pm”.

So then I got curious, and the day before my birthday, I looked up 4:44 on Google, and outcomes as the first search result, the closing album by Jay-Z titled 4:44 because Jay-Z saw it too! And upon checking further, the release date was June 30th, the day I’m checking this up!

And tomorrow would be my birthday!

I was bewildered, and so many thoughts crossed my mind, that I was a great person like Jay-Z, because here I was, thinking seeing 4:44 is a funny quirk, but it’s actually a behavior shared with a successful and famed musical artist.

I wrote email after email to my summer school teacher, friends, and even peers I’ve never talked to in the class email list, detailing to them how I am special and spiritually related to Jay-Z and some such.

Needless to say, I was committed.

During my hospitalization, I connected with many co-patients, with at least 3 of them describing how they ended up in here as being triggered by coincidences.

One of them was in debt for +50,000 and he was checking his gambling ticket obsessively with his bank account up in the computer, and he inadvertently finds his gambling serial number matched to his bank account number exactly, he thought it was a conspiracy, then suddenly he hallucinated numbers jumping off the computer screen and he cut himself open with a kitchen number to get the numbers out, he got like +100 stitches!

So I compares their cases to mine, and I realized we all had some kind of stressor, mine was failing English and taking summer school. Another was passing of her father, she stopped at an intersection that bares his first name and suddenly hears the radio also saying some popular artist that also has her father’s name, and it triggered suicidal ideation in her, and checked herself into the hospital immediately, she never made it to his funeral.

So I’m really need some help because I cannot find anything regarding coincidences being the trigger of psychosis, I looked into the diathesis-stress model, but they don’t specify the type of stress so well, and my psychiatrist believe I was already psychotic before I saw being related to Jay-Z by seeing 4:44.

Please help! Is there such a subset of patients that are sensitive to coincidences in reality?",1,1751124588.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

Like something was already wrong, even before I checked my phone or got out of bed. The weirdest part? Nothing was actually wrong. But my brain didn’t seem to care. My heart would race over the smallest things sending emails, talking to coworkers, even ordering coffee.

There was one moment that kind of broke me. I was in line at a grocery store, and I suddenly felt like I couldn’t breathe. Nothing dramatic happened I didn’t collapse or cry I just left my cart and walked out. Drove home in silence. And when I got home, I sat in my car for 40 minutes before I could even go inside. That’s when I realized this wasn’t “normal stress.” This was anxiety, full-blown and relentless.

So I started small. I began writing down one thing each day that made me anxious and then what I did to face it even if that meant just showing up and doing nothing else. I cut back on caffeine (huge difference), made sleep a priority, and found peace in little routines like stretching in the morning and walking after dinner. I stopped trying to “fix” my anxiety overnight and started learning to live with it instead of constantly fighting it.

And honestly? I joined a few online communities Reddit included where people talk about this stuff without judgment. It’s helped more than I can explain. There’s something comforting about knowing others feel the same silent panic sometimes, and that they’ve found ways to breathe through it.

So yeah, I still get anxious. But now I treat it like the weather. I might not control it, but I can carry my umbrella, wear the right jacket, and remind myself it won’t storm forever.

If you’ve got any daily habits or mindset shifts that help you face anxiety, I’d love to hear them.",1,1751124447.0,QuietButTrying,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

* Remember that construction points are shared with your private investment pool, so sometimes its better to not be constructing yourself and instead let them use all the points. 

* If the private investment pool is just growing even when you are letting them use all the construction points, you need to build more construction sectors.

* As an isolated country like Japan, if you start a Liberate Subject play against someone like GB, they will usually add Open Market as their war goal. Then you just back down and get Free Trade easily.

* Best army for attacking other armies is 50% inf 50% art. Best army for defending is 100% inf. Best army for annoying naval invasions is 50% inf 50% cav (for speed)

* Remember to build trade centers often, otherwise you aren't using the world market feature optimally.

* With the addition of the world market, as a small country its often best to focus on a few high value goods instead of trying to produce everything locally.

* Don't use labor saving production methods (green ones) while there is still peasants and unemployment, unless the buildings are unprofitable.

* As a minor you can get tons of free diplo points from rivaling other remote minors.

* Government admin buildings are basically unprofitable until you have good efficiency PMs for that building, for papir mills, and good tax laws available. So don't try to remove your tax waste as Qing until like 1900.

* Good colony targets: 

* Rubber and whaling oil: Madagascar

* Silk: Thailand and Cambodia

* Tea and coffee: same as 3 above, plus India.

* Opium: same as all above minus Madagascar

* Drilling oil: Nejd.

* Boost and supress movements to help enact laws and give better chances for IG leaders to have better traits.

* Promote all your generals and admirals so they can actually lead large armies/navies in battle. An army group might be able to lead 400 units but if a general can only lead 80 units thats all he will fight with.

* Some society research will change the law preferences of interest groups.",31,1751124155.0,victoria3,9,0.98,False

1lmp8to,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lmp8to/fn_distribution/,[FN] Distribution,"It was just after sunset when I heard a faint noise outside my living room window. I did my best to ignore it, thinking it was probably one of the neighbors' flighty animals sneaking down the block again. There was one heathen in particular who found its way to my front steps a time or two, doing its best to ditch the family and the new puppy they brought home. As I sat on my couch, knee-deep in one of those trashy television shows that help numb the mind after a long day at work, the noise grew closer, louder. 

My back cracked like a light stick when I stood up to stretch, and I muted the television. I shuffled to the front door and placed my ear on the cool surface, listening carefully. A loud meow, close enough to be right on the other side, drifted in. Carefully, as not to scare my visitor off, I opened the door and peeked out. 

Right at my feet stood a small cat. It wasn’t quite a kitten, but couldn’t be more than a year old. From my childhood experience of growing up with kittens my mother fell in love with at first sight, I’d say he was six or seven months old. Its fur was a mix of white and grey in scattered patches, and its eyes were like ice, blue and loud. 

“Hi, little one,” I cooed. I opened the door the rest of the way and slowly bent down. “Where’d you come from?” 

Before I could put my hand out for it to smell that I was not a threat, the cat brushed past me and sauntered right into my living room. There was no hesitation and no fear in entering a stranger's home. I stood confused and a bit dumbfounded as I watched it curl up on one of the couch pillows and fall fast asleep. 


Early the next morning, I woke to the feeling of being watched. I extracted myself from deep under my covers and sat up on the edge of the bed. Doing the usual morning once-over of my room as I finished waking up, my eyes landed on the small ball of fur watching me from the corner of the room. It had completely slipped my morning fog-filled mind that I had let a stray in the night before. Really, it had let itself in.

“Jesus,” I muttered. My heart was beating hard in my chest at the shock. 

We stared at one another for a few minutes. The cat's blue-eyed stare left an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, but it was difficult to look away. It felt like there was something the cat needed to say, though the thought of talking to a cat made me feel insane. I tore my eyes away and grabbed my robe to head down to the kitchen. I needed caffeine. 

The cat followed in my wake down the steps, through the hallway, and into the kitchen. When it jumped up on the counter next to the coffee pot, I was able to get my first real good look at him. There was no collar, no obvious sign of pet shop grooming, and he smelled too much like the lake at the center of town to have lived inside somewhere. 

“Where did you come from?” I asked quietly as I gently rubbed the top of his head. 

An abrupt meow in return made me step back. He shifted closer to the edge of the counter, but his eyes never left mine. 

“Was that back talk?” I asked with a slight laugh. I rolled my eyes at how jumpy I was. 

Another meow filled the kitchen, and he shifted even closer. 

“Nope, you have to go, sir.” A sudden bout of the shakes came over me as I swooped the cat up in my arms. “You're a cat, and if I'm questioning if you're talking to me, that means I’m finally losing the last of my sanity.” I opened the back door and plopped him on the back steps. “No offence, but I can’t afford that right now.”

I shut the door behind me and looked up at the morning sky — my eyes on the distant image of the moon in a half-hearted attempt to center myself. In a self-help book I read when I was in my twenties and on the brink of my last breakdown, I read that focusing on one thing can help ground the mind. If that didn’t work, which my hope was growing smaller for the practice’s success as I felt the heat in my face continue to rise, I remembered the cigarettes in my purse. 

“I wish you luck in finding your home, kitty. God speed and good luck.”

I bid the cat farewell and turned to go back inside, but the sliding glass door suddenly became jammed. My hands turned bright shades of pink and red the harder I tried to pry the door open, but it refused to budge. 

Another louder-than-normal meow startled me.

“Can you please stop doing that?” My voice was far too loud for so early in the morning, but the fear and confusion were beginning to get to me. 

Yet another meow came as a response. This time, though, when I looked down, he was gone. There was a wave of relief, but curiosity took over when I saw a mound of white fur sitting at the wooden fence that separated my yard from my neighbors. The cat was staring through the branches of a bush at their yard, where their garden and lawn chairs sat. 

I hesitated. I could have walked around to the side of the house, broken in my window, gone back to bed, and told myself the cat was merely a vivid dream. But I couldn’t. There was an odd pull that wrapped around me when I laid eyes on that massive bush at the corner of the yard. My neighbor always kept the leaves off my yard and the branches neatly trimmed, so I never paid it or the family who lived there any mind before. 

“You don’t talk back to me.”

A familiar voice, one who’s called over the fence a handful of times when my mail ended up in their box by accident, carried through the air from the other side of the bush. I crouched down low beside the cat and listened closely. My blood ran cold when I heard a small boy and saw his Spider-Man pajama shirt balled up in the man’s fist. 

“Yes, sir,” the small boy said through stifled sobs. 

“I work all goddamn night to keep a roof over your head. You show me respect, or you end up here, with your mother.” The man pointed to the bush. “You understand? You think I’m playing?” 

“Yes, sir. I understand.”

Through the leaves, I caught a glimpse of his tear-stained and splotchy cheeks. The sight of such a young boy, he couldn’t have been more than seven or eight, being dragged across the yard and threatened by his father brought tears to my own eyes. The ghost of the sharp sting of my own father's hand lingered on my skin from years ago. 

I stayed as still as possible until the man thought he had made his message clear enough to bring his son back inside. God only knows what happened when the door closed. 

When they were gone, I ran back to my house and threw the back door open with ease this time. The cat was trailing closely behind, all the way back to my bedroom, where my cell phone still sat plugged into the charger. 

When the police arrived, I was standing outside with my cigarette, coffee, and the cat.

When the small boy emerged from the back door with an officer and showed her to the bush where the morning's threats unfolded, the young officer turned pale and sickly. She called over her radio and, before long, a team had the backyard looking like an excavation site. It was a rumor in town that the boy's mother ran off with a coworker when they both went missing, but it turned out neither of them had gone very far. 

I stomped out my cigarette with the toe of my slipper and watched the little boy crawl into the back of a police car. He looked tired, more than any seven-year-old should. It felt like looking in a mirror. 

A chill ran up my spine when I thought of the cat. I looked down at my feet where he had been sitting, but he was no longer there. All that was left in his place was a tuft of white fur.

""""It Started With Coffee, And Ended With Heartbreak"". Okay, here it is. This is hard to say out loud, even just... writing it down. It feels like pulling a loose thread that will unravel everything I thought I knew about myself. But you asked, or maybe I just need to finally speak it, even if it's just into the quiet space of this page.  It started with coffee. Just coffee. That's what I told myself anyway, back when the lie was still a tiny seed, barely pushing through the soil. It was maybe six months ago? No, closer to eight now, I think. Time gets blurry when you're living with a secret tucked tight against your ribs.  My name is Clara, I'm 28, and I work as a marketing coordinator in a pretty standard office building downtown. I'm in a five-year relationship with Ben. We live together, share a life, have Future Plan involving maybe a dog, maybe a house deposit someday. Ben is… good. He’s kind, reliable, makes terrible jokes that still make me laugh sometimes, and he’s just… comfortable. Like a worn-in sweater. And that’s maybe where it started, the crack in the comfortable.  The office building is one of those big, modern glass and steel cubes. Our company is on the 5th floor. Alex worked for a different company, on the 7th. I’d see him sometimes in the lobby, or waiting for the elevator. He was maybe a couple of years older than me, thirty, tops. He had this quiet energy, you know? Always seemed a bit thoughtful, a little bit outside the usual office hustle. Nice eyes, dark and observant. Nothing that screamed 'danger' or even 'crush material' at first glance. He just… noticed things.  The first time we really spoke wasn't even intentional. The ground floor coffee shop downstairs had a ridiculous line, like always. I sighed, muttering something under my breath about needing caffeine to survive Monday. He was standing near me and just chuckled, a low, pleasant sound. ""Tell me about it,"" he said. ""It should be a basic human right."" We ended up talking for a minute while the line crawled. Just small talk, where we worked, how long we'd been in the building. It was completely innocent. Totally forgettable, probably, for him.  But for me… I don't know. He actually listened. He didn't just wait for his turn to talk, he actually seemed interested in my mumbled complaint about project deadlines. It was a tiny thing, but it felt… nice. Different.  So, the next time I saw him, waiting for the elevator, I smiled and said hi. He smiled back, that same quiet smile, and we talked again. About the weather, about the terrible elevator music, about weekend plans that were decidedly less exciting than they sounded when we described them. These little chats became a few minutes a couple of times a week. It was just a friendly face in the mundane rhythm of the workday. Still innocent. Still just coffee or elevator small talk.  Then, it shifted. Gently, subtly, like the tide coming in without you noticing until your toes are wet. We exchanged work emails ostensibly about some vague building-wide initiative related to recycling, which was a total lie. We both knew it. The first non-work email he sent was a link to an article we'd briefly discussed, something about urban design, which I'm interested in but Ben finds deathly boring. My heart did this strange little flutter when I saw his name in my inbox outside of a company-wide announcement. A tiny spark.  We started emailing back and forth, short messages at first. Then they got longer. More personal. We talked about books we were reading, music, frustrating days at work, stupid office politics. Things I’d normally vent about to Ben, or maybe my closest friend. But talking to Alex was… different. It felt lighter, less burdened by expectation. He’d ask insightful questions, things that made me pause and actually think about why I felt a certain way. He remembered details I’d casually mentioned weeks ago. He saw the parts of me that felt… maybe a little dusty? A little unseen?  That's when the temptation started, insidious and quiet. The thrill of the new email notification. The little burst of dopamine when his name popped up. The way I’d quickly minimize the window if someone walked past my desk. The first layer of secrecy. I didn't tell Ben about these conversations. Why would I? It was just friendly chat with a colleague, right? But deep down, I knew. I knew the energy I was putting into it, the little fizz of excitement I felt, was already outside the bounds of innocent friendship.  The guilt was a low hum at first. Like background noise you can ignore. I'd counter it by being extra nice to Ben, making his favorite dinner, watching that documentary he wanted to see even though I wasn't interested. Trying to balance the scales in my head. But the weight on Alex’s side was growing.  The messaging moved to texts. This felt like a bigger step, crossing a line into personal time, bleeding out of the office context entirely. Late at night, when Ben was scrolling through his phone or already asleep beside me, I’d be messaging Alex. About everything and nothing. About my hopes, my fears, the small frustrations of my day, things I hadn't articulated to anyone, maybe not even myself. He'd respond with empathy, or make me laugh, or offer a different perspective. It felt like building a hidden room just for us, brick by brick, message by message.  The lust wasn’t… physical, not in the traditional sense. It was the lust for connection, for being seen so clearly. It was the thrill of the secret, the almost-danger of it. It was the intoxicating feeling of someone else finding my ordinary thoughts and feelings fascinating. It was the warmth that spread through my chest when he’d say something like, ""That's exactly how I feel,"" or ""You have such a clear way of looking at things."" It was emotional lust, pure and simple. A craving for that validation, that intense focus.  There wasn't a single moment of 'climax' in this story, not like a movie. It was more like a slow, steady erosion. But if I had to pick a point where I knew I had truly crossed a line, emotionally… It was a Tuesday night. Maybe a couple of months ago. Ben was away on a work trip, just for one night. Alex and I were texting, late. It was pouring rain outside, and the city felt quiet. We were talking about feeling stuck, about childhood dreams we'd let go of. I shared something deeply vulnerable with him, something I hadn’t even fully admitted to myself, let alone spoken out loud. It was a fear I carried, a feeling of not being good enough, a creative ambition I’d buried under layers of 'sensible' choices. I typed it out, my thumbs shaky, hesitating over the 'send' button. But I sent it.  His response wasn't just words on a screen. It was understanding. It was acceptance. He didn't try to fix it or offer platitudes. He just… saw it. And he shared something equally vulnerable in return. We talked for hours, until the sky started to lighten. In that moment, sharing those heavy, hidden parts of ourselves in the quiet dark, it felt more intimate than any physical act I could imagine. It felt like our souls were touching, naked and unafraid, in a way mine hadn't with Ben, or maybe anyone, in years.  That was the breakpoint. I closed the messaging app that morning, the light grey of dawn filtering through my blinds, and the weight hit me. Not just guilt, but a crushing certainty. I had built a relationship within my relationship. I had poured energy, vulnerability, and emotional intimacy into someone who wasn't my partner. I was emotionally cheating. There was no other word for it. All the justifications ""It's just talking,"" ""Ben and I don't talk about that stuff,"" ""It means nothing"" they all crumbled. It meant everything. It meant I had given a piece of myself, a vital, intimate piece, to Alex.  After that, the guilt wasn't a low hum anymore. It was a constant, throbbing ache. It sat in my stomach like a stone. Every time Ben touched me, or said he loved me, or just asked about my day, I felt like a fraud. The secret wasn't exciting anymore; it was poison. It made me distant, jumpy, quiet. I’d snap at Ben over small things, or avoid talking about my day altogether, because my day felt increasingly centered around those stolen moments or messages with Alex.  Continuing the connection with Alex became harder, tainted by the heavy knowledge of what it was. But it was also addictive. That feeling of being understood, of the easy connection… it was a siren song I struggled to resist, even as the guilt gnawed at me. I was trapped in my own making, craving the comfort Alex offered while simultaneously hating myself for needing it, for seeking it outside of my relationship.  I started looking at Ben differently. Noticing the things we didn't share anymore, the silences that weren't comfortable but empty, the conversations that stayed resolutely on the surface. Was it like that before Alex? Or did creating this separate world with Alex highlight the gaps in mine with Ben? I still don't know. Probably a bit of both. I started questioning everything my relationship, myself, what comfort versus connection really meant.  Living like that, with the secret pressing down, pretending everything was fine while my inner world was a mess of longing and regret, became unbearable. The person I saw in the mirror felt unrecognizable. The person she was with Ben and the person she was with Alex (or thinking about Alex) were two different people, and the strain of maintaining both was breaking me.  So, that's why I'm saying this. Why I'm finally letting some of the pressure out. It wasn't a drunken mistake. It wasn't a moment of physical weakness. It was a thousand small choices, a slow drift, an emotional affair built on shared vulnerability and stolen time. It was wanting something I wasn't getting, and finding it in someone else, without ever stopping to consider the cost until the price became too high to bear.  And the cost is everything, isn't it? Trust, honesty, the comfortable life we built... I don't know what happens now. Ben doesn't know any of this. Yet. Putting this into words feels like stepping off a cliff. My stomach is twisting, my hands are cold. But keeping it inside was slowly killing me, or maybe killing us, in a different way.  It started with coffee. And somehow, it led me here, to this moment, confessing the quiet, devastating truth of giving my heart's attention away, one stolen conversation at a time. It wasn't just talking. It was building a world. And now I have to face the wreckage.""",1,1751123751.0,story,0,1.0,False

Let’s talk about something that might be lurking in your retirement plan, creeping in whenever you’re not looking... and I’m not talking about that old treadmill you convinced yourself you'd use someday. Nope, I’m diving into the world of *taxes.* I know, it sounds as exciting as watching paint dry, but stay with me. 

Ever felt that thrill of planning your dream retirement? You know, mornings filled with coffee on the beach and afternoons dedicated to perfecting your cornhole skills? 🏖️ But here's the kicker—what if I told you that your grand vision could be derailed by a sneaky little factor that you totally forgot to plan for? 

**Spoiler Alert: It’s taxes!** 

Taxes aren’t just for April 15th. They’re a lifelong companion and, honestly, they can be a bit needy. So, let's break it down a bit:

### Why Your Retirement Plan Needs to Consider Taxes

1. **Tax brackets can change**: If you've only mapped out your retirement at your current tax rate, you could be in for a surprise. What if rates go up? Or what if there are fewer deductions available? 

2. **Different accounts, different taxes**: Think you can just stash cash in your Roth IRA and call it a day? Not so fast! Each type of account (Roth, traditional, taxable) has its own rules about withdrawals that can hit you harder than you think.

3. **Withdrawals = taxable events**: Go ahead and start pulling from that precious retirement savings, but don’t forget Uncle Sam wants a piece of the pie. It’s similar to how your friends always show up when there's pizza involved. 🍕 

4. **Social Security taxes**: Yep, even your social security might get taxed depending on your total income during retirement. Talk about a plot twist!

5. **Estate taxes**: If you're planning to leave a legacy, taxes on your estate can change how much your loved ones actually receive. Yikes! 

Okay, so without getting too down in the tax weeds, what can you do about it? Here are a couple of quick strategies:

- **Diversify your accounts**: Mix it up! Consider a balance between traditional and Roth accounts. 
- **Consult a pro**: Seriously! Find a financial planner who can help you sort through all these tax implications. Or at least someone who’s not afraid to talk about taxes over drinks.

Remember, your retirement doesn’t have to be all spreadsheets and calculator app vibes. It can be about *how you want to live as you age,* enjoying all those lovely years ahead! 🌈

And he shared something equally vulnerable in return. We talked for hours, until the sky started to lighten. In that moment, sharing those heavy, hidden parts of ourselves in the quiet dark, it felt more intimate than any physical act I could imagine. It felt like our souls were touching, naked and unafraid, in a way mine hadn't with Ben, or maybe anyone, in years.  That was the breakpoint. I closed the messaging app that morning, the light grey of dawn filtering through my blinds, and the weight hit me. Not just guilt, but a crushing certainty. I had built a relationship within my relationship. I had poured energy, vulnerability, and emotional intimacy into someone who wasn't my partner. I was emotionally cheating. There was no other word for it. All the justifications ""It's just talking,"" ""Ben and I don't talk about that stuff,"" ""It means nothing"" they all crumbled. It meant everything. It meant I had given a piece of myself, a vital, intimate piece, to Alex.  After that, the guilt wasn't a low hum anymore. It was a constant, throbbing ache. It sat in my stomach like a stone. Every time Ben touched me, or said he loved me, or just asked about my day, I felt like a fraud. The secret wasn't exciting anymore; it was poison. It made me distant, jumpy, quiet. I’d snap at Ben over small things, or avoid talking about my day altogether, because my day felt increasingly centered around those stolen moments or messages with Alex.  Continuing the connection with Alex became harder, tainted by the heavy knowledge of what it was. But it was also addictive. That feeling of being understood, of the easy connection… it was a siren song I struggled to resist, even as the guilt gnawed at me. I was trapped in my own making, craving the comfort Alex offered while simultaneously hating myself for needing it, for seeking it outside of my relationship.  I started looking at Ben differently. Noticing the things we didn't share anymore, the silences that weren't comfortable but empty, the conversations that stayed resolutely on the surface. Was it like that before Alex? Or did creating this separate world with Alex highlight the gaps in mine with Ben? I still don't know. Probably a bit of both. I started questioning everything my relationship, myself, what comfort versus connection really meant.  Living like that, with the secret pressing down, pretending everything was fine while my inner world was a mess of longing and regret, became unbearable. The person I saw in the mirror felt unrecognizable. The person she was with Ben and the person she was with Alex (or thinking about Alex) were two different people, and the strain of maintaining both was breaking me.  So, that's why I'm saying this. Why I'm finally letting some of the pressure out. It wasn't a drunken mistake. It wasn't a moment of physical weakness. It was a thousand small choices, a slow drift, an emotional affair built on shared vulnerability and stolen time. It was wanting something I wasn't getting, and finding it in someone else, without ever stopping to consider the cost until the price became too high to bear.  And the cost is everything, isn't it? Trust, honesty, the comfortable life we built... I don't know what happens now. Ben doesn't know any of this. Yet. Putting this into words feels like stepping off a cliff. My stomach is twisting, my hands are cold. But keeping it inside was slowly killing me, or maybe killing us, in a different way.  It started with coffee. And somehow, it led me here, to this moment, confessing the quiet, devastating truth of giving my heart's attention away, one stolen conversation at a time. It wasn't just talking. It was building a world. And now I have to face the wreckage.""",0,1751123438.0,stories,0,0.5,False

I've been drinking coffee pretty much daily for the past 9 years, probably peaked at 2-3 cold brews/day when i was in a stressful long hours consulting job, but was drinking about 2 cups of french press each morning until recently. I wanted to taper because I knew I would feel really sick if I tried to quit all at once (would get bad headaches in the morning if I delayed my morning coffee even by 1-2 hours), and I wouldn't be able to do my job, so it just wasn't really an option.

  
I started by reducing the amount of coffee I would make in the french press, from 2 cups down to half a cup, reducing by about a quarter cup each week. I seemed to have random positive and negative moments throughout this part - when I was going from 2 to 1.5 I had a couple days of minor headaches, but when I was down to 1 cup or 1/2 cup a day I actually felt way more energized overall with no negative side affects. 

When I got down to 1/2 cup of french press I switched to chai tea. I would make chai concentrate and have the equivalent of 1 cup tea/day, then tapered that down to 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 each week. This was the part where I actually felt the worst. I don't know how much caffeine was in my chai but the first couple of days without coffee, I was really tired and had a hard time concentrating. But I also started noticing way more improvements in my sleep and overall just feeling calm / good so it definitely seemed worth it.

After a couple days of drinking a ridiculously small amount of chai concentrate, I decided to just rip the bandaid off and fully quit. I honestly felt way better than I ever would have thought - I was slightly more fatigued than usual for the first couple days but I was able to work, live my normal life etc. And then after the first couple days, I felt pretty much back to normal in terms of energy levels. 

In terms of quitting caffeine - the benefits have been totally worth it:

* **Sleeping better**: I used to wake up 2-3 times each night, and take 20 minutes to fall asleep. This meant I would need to give myself a 9 or 9.5 hour window in bed each night to get my 8 hours. Now I fall asleep much faster and have only been waking up once, so I only need 8 hours in bed, and have a whole extra hour of my day!
* **Calmer**: My baseline state feels much calmer. I have also noticed that if I am dealing with a stressful situation, I still get stressed, but I don't think my stress levels spike as high as before
* **Energy**: My energy is stable throughout the day. I actually have more energy in the afternoon and evening than I would without coffee, I assume because the coffee would have started wearing off by then and was just masking the underlying fatigue
* **Face**: my skin looks noticeably brighter / less sagging. Maybe correlated with sleeping better, who knows

The biggest downside is just having to push through moments of low energy on my own. There are just times when I really want a coffee, like if I need to knock something out at work, or didn't get enough sleep the night before. And coffee is just perfect for giving you that artificial boost of energy.

For me, I think the taper was totally worth it, I never had any crazy withdrawal symptoms and was able to just keep living my normal life. I've definitely noticed that getting outside in the morning and exercising help to wake me up in the absence of coffee, I would feel way groggier for longer if I didn't get outside. And I also noticed how much drinking alcohol really impacts my sleep. I would wake up feeling so much worse in the morning, and missing coffee so much more, even after having only one or two drinks.

  
At this point, I don't plan to fully stop drinking coffee forever - if there are situations where I really am super fatigued, like after a redeye flight or on a long drive, I would definitely get a coffee. But I wanted to break the daily habit so I could function normally in the morning and not need caffeine to be a real human. I honestly never thought I could do this because I was so addicted before but I'm so happy I did. :) ",8,1751123347.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Generic greetings! Are you a fan of cyberpunk fiction, but tired of all the exciting parts? Sick to death of plots you can easily follow and cool, interesting characters? Bored of heightened drama, high stakes and action? Try [null](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217297039-null), the 725,083rd best-selling book on Amazon!

Follow three nameless, entirely undescribed characters as they mope their way through a cyberpunk dystopia while grappling with nothing more than their personal demons and the nature of reality. This PKDian, Borgesian, Serial Experiments Lainian novel is packed full of so many oblique cultural references and jokes even the author has forgotten what most of them are!

Here's what some internet denizens who were \[mostly\] bribed with free copies had to say about it:

    This book is not for you if you want a coherent and face-value plot with trendy story beats; a named cast; or a novel that runs on a trivially comprehensible path from inciting events to thematic conclusions.
    
    Instead, approach this as a book of IRC-punk poetry. Of nightmares both dreamt and half-forgotten in the time it takes to drink the morning coffee you know you shouldn't drink. Of faceless dialogues between strangers who are apathetically unaware of eachother's agenda. Of events that happen, but when?
    
    Think new wave jazz fusion. You know the instruments but don't understand the sounds or melody's, but slowly you feel your foot tap, and ear worms set in.
    
    This is not as others have said just a Shadowrun novel. Its a idea of what written language can do beside what you are use to reading.
    
    It touches on so many interesting themes from questions of perception to living in today's age where everything is merely a click away. Null can be both odd and something you recognize in daily life at the same time...
    I will be purchasing Null, I found myself going back a few times just to enjoy it from the start more than once on my first read and will probably be re-reading it many times in the future as well.
    
    PKD-esque cyberpunk multistory interwoven like IRC chat. Is one embedded in the other in the next in the first? I don't know! But, I liked it!
    
    Null is not a book that holds your hand. It's written with multiple different styles, from the view of multiple different characters, at multiple different times. There's IRC logs, blog posts, psuedo-interviews, etc. There are times where I was wondering how this all fits together, and to be honest I'm still not entirely sure. But I have my theories.

My past has shaped me into a resilient, adaptable, and deeply caring individual who values honesty, loyalty, and integrity above all else. I much prefer verbal communication to truly connect, and I'm seeking a genuine, non-abusive partner to build a life with, share memories, and finally feel at home. My love language is expressed through quality time, acts of service, physical touch, and words of affirmation. If you're not recovering from a breakup or divorce and are ready for a real connection, I'd love to get to know you.


ABOUT ME

Hair colour: Black

Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

Height: 172cm

Always clean shaven

No tattoos or piercings

Anger: If I get angry, I suffer with a headache. So, I don't. I instead become frustrated and go for a walk or look at the sky.

When I used to get angry in the past, I would feel a sharp pain like someone was stabbing my head with thick needles. The pain would last for an hour or three. During this time I have broken down crying due to the pain.

A few months ago, I found an effective method that helps me relieve frustration which  is to take a paper and frantically scribble releasing all my frustration onto the paper, where I feel alot better in minutes.  

So, if you ever see me bent over the kitchen counter all tensed up scribbling, you will know that I either had a horrible day or I relieved very bad news and my I am in a state of shock where I am trying to make sense of the situation.

Energy: I have been hyperactive since I was a kid and have this ridiculous amount of energy where everyday I struggle to feel tired. I drink warm milk in the morning or stay up till 3AM just to be able to sit and work without feeling the urge to get up and run.

This is why, I want a wife who will let me do all the house chores, while she relaxes. So that I will feel a bit tired and be able to sleep peacefully.


Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

Smoking/Vaping Habits: None, I never have and never will.

Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk and kept it under control.

Finances: I am very good at managing my finances where I manually keep track of my expenses and I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. 

Work out and eat healthy. 

Child-free life: Never had an interest in having kids.

When I was a kid, I was given a German Army Pocket Knife (still have it to this day), basic compass, eight millimeter nylon rope and I had a whistle to send a SOS signal in morse code, all of which I learned from reading books.

I would spend my weekends in the mountains alone, eating blueberries and building a shelter during the heavy rains.

When I fell and hurt myself, I washed the wounds with water from a stream and tied a handkerchief around the wound until I came back home and administered first aid.

This self-learning, yet, fun process thought me how to adapt, navigate in different climates and environments turning forest and jungles into a playground with no restrictions and no adult supervision.

Text vs verbal communication: I am much better at verbal communication and I strongly feel its better to get to know each other over a call as its easy to express oneself emotionally. 


Why AM I STILL SINGLE?

Throughout my life, I have been someone who is lonely from the age of five in school as I was canned by the teachers because I didn't know how to speak a local language that is not spoken anywhere else in the world. I was also tortured by other students to the point where I ended up in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks. As a teenager, I was a this guy who didn't know how to properly communicate with other people due to the lack of social skills and it has taken me years to learn how to socialize. Somehow, I have learned to communicate in a professional environment well, but still struggle sometimes in a social environment where I overthink about what to say.

This is also why I have been single all my life until I was 29, when for the first time I felt what it was like to be in love and feel a sense of peace and happiness I have never felt or experienced before in my life. This relationship with the Chilean women ended in May 2024 as the person I met was a not who she was claimed to be and it's a long weird story that leaves most people feeling surprised and is better told over a call than written out in text. 

I have completely recovered from the painful breakup and now know myself alot better than I used to.

Limerence also made it difficult for me which caused me to mess up in the getting to know stage with anyone  but now I have overcome it to a great extent.

WHY DO I WANT TO GET MARRIED? 

To know that I mean something to one person in this world. 

To feel a sense of peace and not feel so lonely. Don't get me wrong. I have friends, but friends slowly dissappear with time the moment I move to another country, its how my life has always been.

To have someone to share memories together and walk together on this journey called life. 

To build a life together where we work as a team.

Although, my dynamic life is nice where I visit new places all the time and every week is a new experience, its also a life where I feel lonely and even if I make friends, I know that I will have to say goodbye.

I want to settle down somewhere in this world and build a life together instead of living a minimalistic life due to airline weight restrictions.

I have my own house back in my home country (I work abroad), but to me its just a house. Not a place I consider home.

DO NOT;

DO NOT Contact me if your recovering from a break up or divorce because you will use me to heal from your pain and once I help you recover, you will feel a strong sense of independence and think ""I don't a man in my life and need time to focus on myself"" and just discard me like trash, leaving me with dissapointment and where I start wandering how to trust someone. It helps you, but hurts me more.

So far this has happened with a German, French, Russian and the last was the Egyptian. All four were recovering from a painful break up.

Please do not use me just to pass the time because you are bored. 

I have already been through hell in my life since I was five years all the way to adulthood where I have been tortured and suffered with back and knee pains for years until I recovered. I have also nearly drowned as I was held underwater and I have been in coma after my head was dashed against the rocks and I lost alot of blood. What has kept me alive is a calculation; my current age minus averge human life expectancy of 80 years equals the question ""what do I with the rest of my life?"". 

By constantly asking myself this question, I have been living a dynamic life where I work in one country then get a job in another country and work their before moving on to the next country. In each country I have had a different career as I love the challenge and the new experience.

I am NOT writing about what I went through to gain sympathy, but to discourage people who act kind and sweet, yet, take advantage of someone like me who is kind from my heart, can love a partner unconditionally and will care deeply when he falls in love with someone.


WHAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT IN A PARTNER - BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER

1. How you treat other people: it does not matter how kind you are or if you go out of your way to help people or care about animals. What matters is who you are deep down in your heart and how you treat me.

Based on experience people who are sweet, kind, volunteered at animal shelters and seem to be amazing people are the ones who have hurt me the most, however, people who seem to be cold hearted and don't show empathy are the ones who turned out to the most reliable, caring people I know and whne they did show empathy it was real and came from their heart.

So, the only way to judge someone is when their is a disagreement or an area of conflict. Is the other person willing to talk things out and find a solution or is that person going to just leave the moment, their is a disagreement?

2. Religion: I will respect what you believe in and I will be more than happy to go to a place of worship if you want me to tag along, but don't force your religion on me. Thats all I ask.

3. Your Past: Your past is your past and it doesn't matter what bad decisions you made, what matters is who you are now and who you will be in the future. 

So, when we are getting to know each, you don't have to hide any anything or worry about being judged, because I don't. 

If your upfront and honest with me, I can be honest about myself. 

4. Your hobbies and interest. I have a wide range of hobbies and interest and I am also a very open minded person who enjoys new experiences.

5. Cooking: Since, I can cook, it does not matter if you don't know how to cook. 

6. Expressing yourself: If your someone who has trouble showing empathy or your the type of person who finds it difficult to show that you care, that is okay. Sometimes due to the pain and what you have been through. It can be difficult to find the right words or facial expressions to show that you care. 

Also, if you have suffered alot more than I have, it can be hard see my pain when its nothing compared to what you have been through.

Don't overthink, just openly tell me that you don't know how to reply. Tell me you don't feel empathy in your heart. I will understand you.

7. Height: Taller than me or shorter than me? I don't care.

8. Tattoos or birth marks

9. Piercings

10. Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.

11. Hair color or balding: Their are plenty of wigs on the market.

12. Music preferences

13. Movie preferences 

14. Education 

15. Amputation: If you have lost a hand or leg due to an accident, its fine by me.

16. Smoking habits: I don't mind if you do, but I  will be concerned about your health and if you need help trying to quite, I will be their for you in every step of the way.


MY IDEAL PARTNER 

Someone who values honesty, loyalty and integrity. 

Someone who is not abusive (my ex was very sweet and kind on the outside but was very abusive verbally, very selfish and very short tempered). It's an experience, I don't want to go through again.

Maximum weight of 90kg (approximately 200lb)

Eight years ago I weighed 85kg (187.39 lb) and in three months I brought it down to 70kg (154.32 lb)

My three month method to weight loss was:

1. I stopped eating all the junk food and donuts and éclairs and only ate vegetables and meat.

2. I ran everyday in the evening as fast as I could for just 20 to 30 minutes. 

3. Walked at a speed of 12 km/h (7.45 mi/h)


LOVE LANGUAGE 

Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask

Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a partner 
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek once.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to one day.
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").


If you want to get to know each other better send me a message where we can schedule a call at time that is convenient for both of us.

1lmow1l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmow1l,"Nine days, ten meals in the Bay Area","I’m a frequent poster on r/foodlosangeles but I just had a week-long trip up to the Bay Area. While I lived up there from 1990-2006, this was the longest I've been back since moving to L.A. As such, I took advantage of trying a slew of new restaurants (even though I did miss a couple of my old favorites, like San Tung in the Inner Sunset). 

To be very clear, this is *not* some kind of ""best of the Bay"" list. It's really just a food diary of where I ate that week. 

**Day One, Dinner:** [**Burma Superstar**](https://www.burmasuperstar.com/) **(Temescal, Oakland)**

Their OG location in the Richmond district was around when I still lived here and they were my intro to Burmese food in general. As we were meeting up with old friends in north Oakland, when they asked where we should all go eat, Burma Superstar seemed like a solid choice as I haven’t been back to any of their locations in years. 

* Tea Leaf Salad: Still their signature dish. Still good but having had this same salad at other Burmese restaurants in L.A. (and Tokyo) in the time since, I thought it was “mostly ok” rather than “great.” Felt a touch underseasoned and while I like the fried garlic bits, those came off overly aggressive in the absence of a bit more salt to balance things. 7.5/10
* Salt and pepper chicken: We likely normally would have gotten the calamari version but one of the people at our table had just read a story about faux-calamari (using pork bung instead) so he suggested we get the chicken. Fine by me! While I thought this would have been more fried to a crisp — this had a slight crunch — it was still seasoned well and the spicy/sweet sauce it comes with pairs well (and it had more heat than I would have anticipated which I appreciated). 8/10
* Burma chicken curry: A solid bowl of curry chicken. No real notes here except to say that if you poured this whole thing over a bowl of that coconut rice…that’d make for a top notch lunch. 8/10
* Pork belly with mustard greens: I thought this would be more like the Thai crispy pork belly with M greens dish I’m used to but nope: this is slivers of pork belly stir-fried with the greens in a brown sauce that, if I recall, had a hit of fish sauce in there. Personally, I liked this even though it was different from what I expected but my wife thought it was too aggressively spiced (not spicy, just too much going on). Her loss: I finished her portion for her. 8/10
* Non-alcoholics Burma cooler: meh. Sounded good in the menu but while I thought it’d be more like a ginger beer, it tasted like “beer with some ginger”. 5/10

All in all, a good meal and I was happy to go back there but while I generally don’t like complaining about value—least of all for some place in this neighborhood—I did think there was a gap between “what you’re paying for” vs. “what you’re getting.” Wasn’t a rip-off but yeah, not the best value proposition either. 

**Day Two, Lunch:** [**Pho Ha Noi** ](https://phohanoi.com/)**(East San Jose)**

On my way to drop my wife off, we were passing through this part of the South Bay and while I’ve had Vietnamese food in SF and Oakland, I somehow had never had it in SJ so I hit up a Vietnamese American friend who grew up in the area and he sent me a slew of places to choose from. I wanted to go to Mi Quang for their bun bo hue but they’re not open on Sundays so we opted for Pho Ha Noi instead, located in that massive Vietnam Town mall. I live in the SGV, which has more than its share of pho spots, and I work close to Westminster, aka the VA capitol of America (though I guess SJ might vie for that title as well) and I have never ever seen a Vietnamese restaurant the size of this place. It’s like Cheesecake Factory big and they were busy as hell on this Sunday afternoon. Luckily the wait wasn’t too long.

* Oxtail pho: my gold standard for this dish is Pho 79 in Westminster, one of the OG pho stands in California. If you’ve never had it there; the bowl feels practically decadent with the amount of tender oxtail you get with it and their broth is deep and savory. The version at Pho Ha Noi was…good but that’s about it. The broth was just ok; I wanted more depth out of it. The oxtail wasn’t as tender as it could have been (though it wasn’t chewy or anything). I wasn’t disappointed by this so much as just…whelmed by it. 7/10
* Imperial crab roll: this was a perfect appetizer-sized of two rolls, nicely fried and the crab flavor was right there from the first bite to the last. I feel like a plate of these might be too much so I appreciated enjoying one roll for each of us without entering into diminishing returns territory. 8.5/10

Decent meal but given all the other options in San Jose, I’d sooner try a new place than come back here any time soon. 

**Day Three, Lunch:** [**Breadbelly**](https://www.breadbellysf.com/) **(Richmond District, S.F.)**

I was visiting an old friend in the Richmond and we had intended to get lunch at a Thai noodle spot nearby but we arrived before they had opened and feeling impatient, my friend suggested we check out [Breadbelly](https://www.breadbellysf.com/). a small bakery/sandwich stand on Clement and 15h. My friend warned me, “for some reason, this place has been getting a done of hype lately but I don’t get it, personally.” That said, she had enjoyed the food overall even if she didn’t think it lived up to high expectations and so wasn’t hesitant to bring me there (so long as I kept my expectations more moderate). 

* Breakfast Sandwich: I’m not entirely what I even expect from any breakfast sandwich besides eggs but this didn’t align with whatever vague idea I had in my head. The make theirs with smoked man, gruyere, some kind of marinated kale, lettuce, and yes, a fried egg. I’m not sure I got “breakfast vibes” from it but it wasn’t a bad sandwich by any means. The texture of the ingredients plus bun was pleasing, and everything was spiced really nicely. Would I have liked some bacon on top? Sure but this wasn’t a failure without any. 7.5/10
* Kaya Bun: this is their take on the classic HK pineapple bun except it has a pandan and coconut cream filling and a matcha topping. Delicious. I could have even a bag of these (and felt very guilty about that later) but damn, these were good. 9/10

Neither of us were blown away by our lunch here but it wasn’t bad by any means. 

**Day Three, Dinner:** [**Xpression**](https://xpressionrestaurant.com/) **(North Berkeley)**

I stayed in north Berkeley at a friend's house and while I never hung out near north campus in the dozen years I attended Cal, I figured the Euclid block across from Northgate would be a way to relive my college years by going out for some inexpensive dinner. Xpression is an Indian fast casual spot, the kind of place where you can order at the counter but also on a touchscreen nearby. The menu is vaguely fusion-y—Monday night is tandoori chicken nachos night, for example—but it generlaly sticks to the script of common Indian food found in California cities. 

* Samosa chaat: Either this or bhel puri are my favorite of the common chaat snack options and I do like the warmth of the dish when the smashed samosa is still hot. Add in all the yogurts and sauces and other toppings and a good samosa chaat is like a festival of an appetizer. The version here was solid; no notes. 8/10
* Tandoori chicken: Alas, this was pretty bad. Way too overcooked and thus, dried out. Whatever flavor was supposed to originally there now just tasted a monotone “charred”. There were a handful of more tender bites but overall, this was just bad. 4/10

I mean, there’s a reason places that cater to college students don’t generally draw interest from folks decades older. I can’t say this was “disappointing” as I went in with low expectations. 

**Day Four, Lunch:** [**Brenda’s Meat and Three**](https://brendasmeatandthree.com/) **(Divisadero, S.F.)**

I have an old acquaintaince who’s now a food writer, [Tamara Palmer](https://www.thetamarapalmer.com/), and amongst other things, she has a [mapped list of her 200 favorite Bay Area restaurants](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1MVPwtsIDWqwxkmfsay7g7Mmq6bsg-O4&ll=0%2C0&z=10). I was looking for somewhere close to the Lower Haight and Brenda’s — a New Orleans-influenced diner — caught my eye, especially their weekday breakfast sandwiches served until 11am for $5 plus $2 sides. I really enjoyed this meal, so much so that I came back to try dinner a few nights later. Their “Brenda’s Breakfast Club” menu is an incredible value but even if they had charged more, I would have enjoyed the hell out of the meal.

* Messy Mess (fried chicken breakfast sandwich): Truth in advertising…this was indeed messy. It’s a fried chicken cutlet atop a runny egg, with tomato, a big slice of American cheese, and a chipotle remoulade, on a bun. And basically, within 2-3 bites, this was beginning to disintegrate. Normally, I don’t like sloppy sandwiches but hey, they did warn me it’d be messy so that was my own fault. Still delish though! 8/10
* Corn succotash: I wanted some kind of vegetable on the side and this sounded good: corn, lima beans, a couple of other diced vegetables. It was ok. I thought it was underseasoned so I hit it with a dash of salt and some shakes of Louisiana hot.  6.5/10
* Potato hash: this was one of the sides you can order with the Breakfast Club sandwich. Also slightly underseasoned and I wanted them crispier. 6.5/10
* Fried chicken wing: their fried chicken is part of what they’re known for so I wanted a wing on the side to try it. Fantastic stuff: a deep, dark, crunch crust (well seasoned too). The meat was still hot and juicy. It doesnt need the sweet/spicy dipping sauce but it didn’t hurt, either! If you gave me a platter of these, I’d polish it off. 8.5/10
* Plain beignet: while the sides were fine, I did find the beignet to be a disappointment; it was just way too dense. I’m not a beignet expert but I’ve been to New Orleans and I’ve have beignets from a few places there and those were all on the lighter side, like a donut or malasada but the beignet here was closer in consistency to a biscuit. It just wasn’t a hit for me. 5/10

**Day Four, Dinner:** [**Base Camp**](https://basecampsf.com/) **(Outer Mission, S.F.)**

I had dinner with an old friend who lives in Bernal Heights and she picked this place. After that hella mid Indian dinner from the night before, this Indian/Nepalese restaurant was a welcome bounce back. 

* Fried chicken: This is one of my friend’s favorite dishes here and while I’m not sure what’s Nepalese about the dish, I can see why she likes it so much. It has one of those really light, almost panko-like crusts and the deboned chicken thighs had been pounded thin so there was this really nice ratio of crunch to meat. The batter was underseasoned I thought but the sauce they pair this with made up the difference. 8/10
* Goat curry: If you order goat curry and they include pieces still attached to the bone in there, you know it’s legit. Similar to the Burma Superstar curry from a few nights earlier, this was really solid and satisfying in the way you want a good curry to be but I don’t have much to say beyond that. 8.5/10
* Tofu chow mein: My friend and I are both Chinese American and when she said, “I know this may sound crazy but they do really good choiw mein here,” I was like, “really?” I haven’t had chow mein in years so I was game to try it and…it was ok. The texture of the noodles were good and the ingreidents were all done nicely but last time my friend ordered it, she underestimated how spicy their “medium spicy” is so this time, she asked for it to be mild. The problem was that the chow mein is sweet and without some spicyness to counter-balance things, it was just on the edge of being cloyingly sweet. I’m glad we tried this but I wouldn’t get it again. 7/10

**Bonus Dessert:** [**Bi-Rite Creamery**](https://biritemarket.com/creamery/) **(Inner Mission, S.F.)**

After dinner, we decided to take a short walk over to Dolores Park and get dessert at Bi-Rite. Luckily, because it was on the chillier side, there wasn’t a massive line. 

* Coffee toffee + peanut butter swirl in a sugar cone. Really good ice cream. The coffee was actually bitter in a refreshing way though I could have done without the toffee chips, in hindsight. The peanut butter swirl was ace though: rich and decadent. 8/10

**Day Five, Lunch:** [**Cali Alley**](https://calialley.com/) **(Southwest Berkeley)**

After back to back days in S.F. I had the first of two days in the East Bay. For lunch, I met up with an old friend (I saw a lot of old friends this week) and Cali Alley was near him. 

* Banh Mi Burger: I had a [pho brisket on rye sandwich the other week](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1l6qfwj/pho_brisket_on_rye_and_broth_glendora/) so maybe I was like “sure, let’s try another Vietnamese-inspired fusion sandwich”. It’s a burger that comes with thick slices of pork belly plus the fish sauce-laden julienned vegetables you’re used to tasting in any garden variety banh mi. This wasn’t a “bad’ burger but it didn’t work in giving me strong banh mi notes. The pork belly could have been more tender but there was also just too much of it on an already big burger to start with. And the banh mi style vegetables did not, in my opinion, work with the flavor of the beef in the burger. I feel like: if you want to serve banh mi, serve a banh mi. If you want to serve a burger, serve a burger. Like I said, it wasn’t bad but it wasn’t great either. 6/10

**Day Six:** I cooked my own lunch and had a dinner at a friend’s. 

  
**Day Seven, Lunch: back to Brenda’s**

I went back to try their fried chicken sandwich, the lunch one, not the breakfast special. Alas, this didn’t quite work for me. I thought that whatever they put sauce wise, was too acidic and so the flavors fell out of balance to me. Also, while it was not as messy as the “messy mess “breakfast version, this also began to fall apart about halfway through and I don’t like it when my sandwiches begin to disintegrate. It wasn’t bad but I wouldn’t get it again either. 6.5/10

It came with either fries or coleslaw and they were kind enough to hook me up with both in half portions. The fries really quite good, I would’ve been happy with the full order of that! 8.5/10. The coleslaw was whatever; ironically, it would’ve benefited from more acid. 5/10

**Day Eight, Dinner:** [**T’Chaka**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tchaka-oakland) **(downtown Oakland)**

Met up with a set of friends who live in Oakland Chinatown and I told them to pick one of their favorite places in the area. I haven’t had Haitian food since fall 2023 so I was very much down to check out T’Chaka. 

* Akra: This appetizer is made from deep fried, grated taro root and it was cripsy and delicious. The spicy pikliz they serve with it is, indeed, very spicy. I appreciate that about Haitian food; when they say spicy, they’re not kidding. 8.5/10
* Griot plate: I wanted to get their Sat. special which was a beef and pork stew but they ran out so I “settled” for fried pork chunks. I didn’t even think about this until now but that last time I had Haitian food, I’m pretty sure I also ordered griot (fried pork, hard to resist!). This was done pretty well, with a good balance between lean and fattier bites. It was also seasoned ok but I think the dish, overall, needed more acid. The pikliz helps with that but given the heat level, you want to use that sparingly so I feel like it needed the acid from some other source, just to help with the balance. That said, still enjoyable overall. 7.5/10 

**Bonus Dessert:** [**UC Dessert**](http://www.ucdessert.com/) **(Oakland Chinatown)**

After dinner, we walked a couple of blocks to get dessert. We picked this spot mostly because it was close and still open; I don’t mind Chinese dessert but the size of this menu makes you think “they probably do most things fine but it’s not going to be great because there’s just too much they offer” and the result was pretty much that. There were three of us so we each picked a dish and shared. 

* Oreo eggpuff: Looks great. Tastes…ok. The egg puff was a bit dry and Orea bits + chocolate sauce + ice cream risks getting cloyingly sweet. 6/10
* Mochi balls with sesame paste and black sticky rice: this was my pick and it was rather mid. The mochi balls (filled with black sesame) were just ok and the paste lacked any distinction. The sticky rice was way watered down. 4/10
* Mochi balls with ginger: at least the mochi balls were better here; not sure what happened with the ones in the previous dish but they not have been cooked as long and you want them really hot, ideally. The ginger syrup these were in was fine but nothing memorable. 6.5/10

**Day Nine, Brunch:** [**Breaking  Dawn Brunch**](https://www.breakingdawnbrunch.com/) **(Los Gatos)**

On my last day, I met up with a friend who lives in San Jose and he suggested this Vietnamese-inspired fusion spot on an apparently cursed corner in Los Gatos where it’s the third restaurant in there since the pandemic. The decor felt like it was kept over from its previous Italian identity; fancy but in a Z Gallerie kind of way (if that reference makes any sense to anyone here). That said, I did enjoy the food. 

* Pho poutine: Having had that meh banh mi burger, I was a skeptical of this one but my friend suggested it and I figured, “why not?” It’s made with a pho short rib gravy, very melty cheese curds, draped on top of the fried potatoes. While I felt it was oversalted, the flavors and textures worked well together, especially the richness of the pho gravy. I wouldn’t want to eat this as an entree but for a starter? Heck yeah. 8/10
* Chicken breakfast burrito (but with beef): the server was trying to sell me on their banh mi dip but I opted for a pretty straightforward breakfast burrito. Somehow, they ran out of chicken(?!) so I had them sub in beef instead and as someone who’s been rather let down by other breakfast burritos over the past few months, this was done pretty competently. The ratio of ingredients was done well: enough egg, not too much potato, the right amount of beef, etc. Paired with the sauce they serve on the side (some kind of very lightly spicy mayo), each bite was good. I was so full already—damn pho poutine!—that I kept half the burrito for later, not really considering “I have an eight hour drive home and am I going to trust this as leftovers by then?” I ended up throwing away the other half with great regret. I should have just finished it and skipped dinner later, ha. 8.5/10
* Banh xeo tacos: my friend ordered this and I didn’t try it but I have to say that making tacos using banh xeo batter, fried up and shaped into a hard shell: kind of genius. My friend said it was solid.

Overall, assuming this place doesn’t succumb to the curse of failed restaurants, I’d totally come back here again. I love a savory breakfast and this place delivered and then some. I don’t love their literal burger-making machine inside ([Burger Bots](https://www.burgerbots.com/)). I mean, I know this is Silicon Valley but seriously, come off that bullshit. You don’t need a robot making your burgers. 

\*\*\*

And there it is...after brunch, I picked up my wife from her week-long retreat nearby and hit the road for home. Looking forward to coming back!

1lmovoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lmovoa/should_you_buy_the_best_compact_espresso_machine/,Should You Buy the Best Compact Espresso Machine De'Longhi Dedica Arte EC885M?,"The De'Longhi EC885M Dedica Arte Espresso Machine arrived just as I was downsizing kitchen gadgets in an attempt to reclaim precious counter space. With its slender 6-inch-wide frame, this machine promised pro-level espresso power without demanding a square foot of territory. After brewing cup after cup—some excellent, some... experimental—I feel confident sharing the highs, lows, and latte art battles this espresso maker brings to the table.

**Compact Without Compromise**

The most striking feature of this machine is its form factor. You won’t believe a fully automatic espresso machine like this fits into such a tight area—I’ve had to double check that the steam wand didn’t sacrifice power for the slim footprint. It slides seamlessly between my bread box and toaster, looking more like a fashion piece than a kitchen appliance. The stainless steel body not only catches the eye but also resists fingerprints better than other chrome-heavy counterparts. For city dwellers or anyone suffering from countertop claustrophobia, it’s a game-changer.

**Hands-On Brewing Like a Pro**

Every morning starts with a routine: grind the beans, tamp manually with the tamper provided (feels solid in your hand, like the ones you see baristas use), insert the filter, press a button, and magic happens. The 15-bar pressure system makes a significant difference—it’s just enough to give that café-style crema on top without you overthinking the variables. I experimented with both single and double filter baskets; the machine accommodates up to 18 grams of coffee, which is pretty generous for a device of this size. 

[Find the best price for De'Longhi EC885M on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/i/b09hlb4dp4/)

**Steam Wand with a Heart of Latte**

The My LatteArt steam wand is clearly designed with aspiring latte artists in mind. My six-year-old niece watched me sculpt a foamy heart in steamed milk and called it ""magic coffee,” which honestly isn’t far off. It takes a bit of a learning curve, though—not due to poor design, but because it behaves more like a commercial-grade wand. You do have precise control over milk texture, which is more than I can say for most steamers under this price point. I managed silky microfoam for cappuccinos and tight velvet for lattes. Depending on the milk brand and pitcher height, your mileage may vary, but with some practice, this wand delivers.

**Pluses**

- Compact and elegant, fits in small kitchens effortlessly
- Includes a professional tamper and generously sized baskets
- 15-bar pressure delivers rich, crema-topped espresso
- My LatteArt wand produces barista-level foam with some practice

**Adverse Aspects**

- Heating time is a bit slower than other machines in its class
- Vibrations during brewing can rattle lightweight mugs
- Water tank, although decent at 35 oz, will need regular refilling for heavy users

**User-Friendly or User-Challenge?**

This espresso machine has a semi-automatic personality with some added brainpower. The Automatic Flow Stop may lull you into thinking it’s doing all the heavy lifting, but precision is still required on your part. Dialing in your grind size, coffee amount, and tamping technique directly affects your brew quality. That being said, once you figure out your preferred settings (and possibly one disappointing shot later), the machine delivers consistent results. I did appreciate how the double drip tray removes effortlessly to accommodate my tall latte glasses.

**Product Contenders**

There are a few noteworthy rivals in the same category. The Breville Bambino Plus boasts a near-instant heat-up time and automatic milk frothing—which is convenient—but lacks the same level of manual control. If you’re into perfecting your technique, the Dedica Arte gives you more of that tactile espresso bar feel. Nespresso machines like the Creatista offer pod convenience, yet fall short for those who prefer freshly ground beans and customizable pressure. Where this device shines is a balance between compact professional aesthetics and hands-on brewing, without going fully manual like the Gaggia Classic Pro.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

In terms of cost-effectiveness, the Dedica Arte hits a sweet middle ground. It doesn’t try to compete with ultra-budget options, and it doesn't pretend to be a $1200 espresso behemoth either. Considering that it includes both ESE pod compatibility and full ground-coffee support, you're buying into flexibility. The professional-style accessories—especially the real metal tamper, which usually ends up as an aftermarket purchase—make this feel like more than the sum of its parts. This was an investment for me, but one I felt comfortable recommending to my cousin who just moved into a smaller apartment and wanted the real espresso experience without remodeling his kitchen.

For the locals please rate my experience and whether it does the city justice - I have free time on Sunday so please let me know if you think I missed a place to visit. About me: I’m a 35 year old hetero male that enjoys the outdoors. Right now I prioritize my career (engineering) and getting into a long term relationship. 

Monday: Ate at Obon Shokudo and then watched the sunset at Mt. Tabor while there was live music played by Curbside Serenade (occurs every Monday at 7pm up at reservoir 5). This was an amazing experience and my introduction to how big of an art culture there is here. 

Tuesday: Walked around Old Town, went to Powell’s bookstore and explored many topics. Watched Nune Tunes live music in Pioneer Square (happens Tues/Thurs 12-1pm). I got bored and didn’t feel comfortable in the city. There were a lot of homeless people and the city did not seem to have energy. Sidewalks smelled bad and overall I had anxiety due to feeling on guard. It was clear that many of the homeless have mental issues and/or using drugs. I spent a bit of time hiding away in my hotel room. So I decided I must leave the city the next day to feel grounded again. 

Wednesday: Hiked Trail of Ten Falls at Silver Falls State Park (this was an amazing experience) and then went to OMSI adult night with a neuroscience topic of lecture/video series. It was hard for me to meet people attending solo, but regardless I enjoyed it. 

Thursday: I volunteered at a small farm that grows food for homeless children. Then met with a Meetup group for the Alberta Arts Street Fair (happens Thursday 6-9pm). This was fun, lively, and a celebration of art and diversity. I really enjoyed this - first I had the company of the Meetup group and second I was not anxious due to homeless presence. I found there were extroverted women that were energetic and sought genuine and emotional connection. From a potential dating perspective, I liked this and would love to meet more women of this type.

Friday: Explored Mississippi Ave - got coffee and hung out at The Fresh Pot for coffee and some reading. Stopped by Pistils Nursery (nice indoor and outdoor plants), Sunlan Lighting (a niche store that sells every imaginable light bulb), ReBuilding Center (this was a neat second hand hardware store), got some spring rolls at Little Bloom Loa and Thai food truck, then checked out Flutter and Paxton Gate (both stores have a natural earthy vibe), another coffee at Capitola Coffee (yes I love caffeine), then dinner at Prost (this place has a lively patio with several food trucks to choose from). Overall I really loved the vibe of this area - I could see myself living here. Are there other places like it? To cap off the night I went to a the Kickstand Comedy show at Laurelhurst Park (free weekly show set among giant trees and a good crowd starts at 6:30pm). 

Saturday: Cars and Coffee car show, Saturday farmers market, and the Nordic Midsummer Festival. 

Overall, here’s my impression. Please let me know if you agree or point out things that may not be accurate - I would not be able to live downtown due to the homeless, and I preferred smaller neighborhoods like Mississippi Ave. Generally, homelessness seems to be a problem you can’t escape here, but there are pockets of quieter areas. The people here are friendly - they seem open to talking to strangers that come from a different ethnic background. Overall, very accepting people, whether that comes to gender, sexuality, or race. As a male looking to date an ENFP type of female, this seems like a good place to meet women that are the extroverted, emotional type that seek genuine connection. True? People often smile when passing by and genuinely mean it when they say “have a good day.” I’m liberal and support the LGBTQ community, but I have not experienced seeing such a large and expressive population. The way some people dress makes me feel uncomfortable, but this is due to my lack of exposure. I believe fully in self-expression and realize this is something I would overcome through exposure to the community and new friendships. There also seem to be a lot of tattooed people, and that’s not something I’m used to either. Talking about community, there seems to be a lot of that here - especially related to art. All the public shows at the parks really demonstrate the strong sense of community. I saw so many folks walking or biking over to the park to meet with their friends and neighbors. I love that. There’s easy access to the outdoors and hikes. Although it does seem rather flat in the vicinity of the city. The food scene is mediocre with there being a large presence of food trucks. There is some cultural diversity - mostly while, some Scandinavian, Asian, Mexican, Indian, and Black.

Saturdays. For like 2 hours only would be fine. Or light a parents night out thing at least. You'd think everyone would be happy cause the 2 year old doesn't have to go to ""school"" today. Usually is.

We certainly like having her around most of the time. Today no... she's just unpleasant no matter what. Just whining today for nothing. Walking around despairing over absolutely nothing. Haven't had a word with my wife and my coffee is cold and it's almost 10am. We know someday she's like this and it's normal but if it's not the most exhausting thing to start the day with persistent whining, crying, and endless unreasonable request and your doing all the right things but it persists.I know I sound like an asshole. I'm really not. Weekends just hit different when we don't have family around to help (often). My favorite days have become weekdays where my wife is at work and I'm off. Selfishly I just do what I want ot take, care of day to day stuff like cooking, or just stare off in the distance for an hour. Then I give my undivided attention to my daughter. That has been the benefit of daycare. I do spend less time with her but the time I do spend is much better quality on weekdays where I got to eat, drink and take care of all the things that make me sweat in my sleep at night.

I was uncomfortable at first putting my daughter in daycare but because both my wife and I work full time demanding jobs as you all know it's hard to make ends meet. We're doing fine I just don't have the lump sum of money saved up for a rainey day (also because of daycare). It's paycheck to pay heck at the moment 
 
Anyway, I'm just gna take her to the park and wear her out in a bit. Everything is okay. It's going to be the best day ever. I'm fine. It's alright....

I have a De’Longhi Dedica and I’ve just bought a bottomless portafilter with a single, non-pressurized basket.
I’m using a Shardor burr grinder with 31 settings.
With the original pressurized basket, I used 7 grams of coffee at the second-finest grind setting, and the flow was good—not watery, with decent flavor, though the crema was limited because of the pressurized filter.
That’s why I got this new basket, but when I tried it, I found I had to use a double dose (about 15 grams) and the finest possible grind setting.
Still, the result wasn’t great—the flow was too fast and the taste too strong, probably because it’s a double shot for a single espresso.
Can anyone give me some advice? I think the holes in this basket might be too big. Maybe if I find one with smaller holes, I could lower the dose and still get a good espresso.
Right now, if I reduce the dose, it just comes out as dirty water.

I’d rather not change my grinder, since I paid €70–80 for it, and buying a better one would cost more than the coffee machine itself.",0,1751122515.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

If not, then I ask you to forgive me.

And the problem is this: I constantly want to sleep, always, almost at any time of the day, regardless of how much I slept.

I have never had any problems falling asleep, or waking up from the alarm clock. But despite the fact that I sleep 8-9-10-11+ no matter how many hours, I always wake up already broken and tired as if I didn't get enough sleep (although this is naturally not true). If I don't restrain myself with any schedules and daily routines, I can sleep 12-14 hours a day, if not more. And still, during the day I walk around and feel very sleepy, I often yawn, and if I lie down on the couch, I will certainly doze off right away. In general, almost every single day in the middle of the day I need to sleep because I feel very sleepy and tired to such an extent that I can’t sit still and concentrate at all.

This has been happening to me for a long time, I can't even remember when it started. And it's been going on and on for years. I stopped drinking caffeine (I generally like drinking coffee) - it didn't help at all. I tried to restrain myself with clever daily routines and they still didn't help with establishing a normal and adequate sleep pattern. I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke, I don't use drugs.

About 1-1.5 years ago I started taking Abilify 5 mg and Wellbutrin 300 mg as prescribed by a psychiatrist. At first, this combination invigorated me and I really didn't sleep during the day and got enough sleep in 8 hours of sleep, but it lasted for about half a month and everything went back to ""normal"".

What should I do? How can I solve this problem with drowsiness? I'm tired of sleeping a lot and still walking around all sleepy. I don't even know which doctor to make an appointment with, what kind of person deals with such issues.

1lmok86,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1lmok86/had_some_success/,Had some success,"Hey sugar buns!
This is going to be a long one and I need your advice on this. 
Last year I met my SD from reddit and surprisingly it went pretty well. We both happened to be in London so we quickly brought up conversations about M&G. We just met near a station in central London and just chose what restaurant to pop into on the spot. It was one of the best dates of my life. We were talking for 2 hours while enjoying the food, we went to a michelin star restaurant for our next date and he even got me a gift from Dior in Selfridges as well as my full allowance as that was the day that we also agreed to start intimacy. I’m really grateful that he trusted to give me the full month’s allowance. The chemistry was so amazing that we changed dynamics to a vanilla relationship and it went downhill from there. His business wasn’t doing well anymore even though he still wanted to provide me with an allowance in a vanilla relationship so I told him to just forget about the allowance. But we kinda just grew apart really so it did not last very long. I still use the perfume he got me and he always used to get champagne and chocolate for me before our dates. 
Now, even for my past vanilla relationships, I was always getting spoilt with gifts, so it’s just normal for me. Even one of my exes still to this day buys me gifts just because he saw them and thought of me and sends them to my address. And he’s in another city so the chances of us getting intimate are pretty low.
I recently met this guy on social media again. I personally want to get rich myself as well as being a trophy wife (spoiled) and I think that’s what my previous SD found attractive in me aside from looks. So there’s this profession that I’m very interested in and my degree also revolves around it, and I’m very driven to get what I want and that is this particular profession. Now the issue is that this new guy I met on socials is also in the same field but 10 years older than me. I think my first mistake was telling him casually that I’m very keen to get into this field and the companies related to this field are not that many. Then he also told me that he is in this profession and that he feels threatened by me because what if I get into the same company as him in the future or try to threaten him with his job. He said he finds me attractive physically and personality wise but this is too risky for him. I understand how it feels but I think he is being a bit dramatic in this case. 
I am a lot younger than him so we are in very different stages of life so the possibility of us ending up in the same company isn’t too high. 
He said let’s just have a coffee date and take things from there and I half accepted but again, I feel like this guy is just coming up with a stupid excuse. What he wants isn’t really a sugar relationship either, he just wants to spoil his woman but not by handing out cash. Just shopping, trips, meals. 

I don’t have a problem with that. In fact, I find this a lot better as I had the same thing with my vanilla relationships too. I think he wants to be more like a sugar daddy but doesn’t want this to give him escort vibes. He said I’m a bit young for him as well and all of this makes me feel like he doesn’t even know what a sugar relationship is. He is being vague about the spoiling aspect as well. And the age gap is just one of the things with sugar relationships. 
Do you think he sounds genuine and I should go ahead with his coffee date? That just screams low effort too. But I try to look at it from the perspective that he just wants to see if we click the same way we do over text and maybe he just doesn’t want to sit through a meal if he doesn’t want to continue. 

What I’m feeling is that it is me carrying the weight of this situation and if someone isn’t 100% sure then what is the point in drinking coffee with them? What if I show up to the cafe and he doesn’t? What if he’s the type of guy who just wants to ruin women’s ego? 

Will appreciate it if you help me decide. My gut instinct is not helping me. 


EDIT: this new guy also told me that if I studied another degree it would have been fine but the degree that I have is closely related to the profession. I’m the type of person who would not change just for the convenience of some guy. I believe it is not my problem that I’m passionate about this field and I should in no way change myself to adjust to the comfort of a grown man. Something about this just shows how arrogant he can be, right? ",1,1751122043.0,sugarlifestyleforum,8,1.0,False

XRP and the New Frontier of Resilient Value

Picture a world suddenly thrown into darkness. The grid fails, city lights vanish, banks go silent, and global communication is cut to a trickle. In that quiet, most of today’s digital financial networks, those that depend on endless streams of power, armies of miners, and energy-hungry validators, simply go dark.

If you’re new to crypto, think of XRP as a digital record-keeper, one that doesn’t need to be plugged into a giant machine or kept alive by a global power grid. It’s built to endure quietly where other systems fail.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are locked in an arms race of energy and hardware, XRP was engineered for efficiency. Its unique consensus model uses no mining, no staking, and requires a fraction of the energy of legacy blockchains. A single XRP transaction consumes around 0.0079 kilowatt-hours of electricity, less than what it takes to power a lightbulb for five seconds, and over 50,000 times less than a typical Bitcoin transaction. This isn’t a compromise. It’s a feature. XRP is designed to keep flowing when the rest of the world stops.

For the technically minded, unlike proof-of-work chains, XRP’s validators use the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm, agreeing on the order and outcome of transactions without ever competing for rewards or burning electricity. Ledger closes are fast and final, typically within three to five seconds, even with minimal infrastructure.

Imagine a true crisis. A global blackout, an EMP, or a systemic collapse. Networks that depend on industrial-scale resources can’t simply restart. They need time, energy, and thousands of nodes to reassemble the past. XRP is different. Its validator network is lightweight by nature. With just a small quorum of trusted validators, as few as thirty-three can maintain full consensus, the ledger can pause, survive the dark, and restart with minimal infrastructure. In some scenarios, a solar-powered laptop and a basic satellite uplink would be enough to bring XRP’s ledger back to life. That’s not just green. That’s resilient. That’s survival-grade.

XRP’s design doesn’t just make it blackout-resistant. It is also uniquely suited for a world where the internet is fragmented or where settlement must happen beyond Earth. Ripple and its partners have already experimented with running blockchain payment channels over satellite and low-bandwidth networks. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which need massive throughput and computation, XRP can achieve consensus with tiny amounts of data between a handful of validators, sometimes as little as a few kilobytes per block. Today we’re surrounded by constellations of satellites. Tomorrow it might be settlements on the Moon or Mars, needing a ledger that doesn’t choke on distance, power, or hardware. XRP’s consensus model isn’t tied to geography. It can run wherever its validators can reach each other, even between worlds.

Most financial systems are chained to geography and energy. XRP breaks both of these chains. Its consensus doesn’t care where the validators sit, as long as they’re in sync. Theoretically, an XRP transaction could move from a Mars colony to Earth and settle nearly as fast as one sent across town. Even as light delay becomes real, XRP’s protocol is adaptable, capable of bridging isolated settlements, orbital habitats, and remote stations where energy is precious and infrastructure is sparse.

Critics will argue all digital systems need energy. Nothing is energy-free. That’s true. But the real divide is scale. Bitcoin consumes about 707 kilowatt-hours per transaction, enough to power an average U.S. home for three weeks. XRP uses less than it takes to brew a cup of coffee. Some will claim if you shrink the validator set, you increase centralization. But resilience doesn’t require every node to be everywhere, just enough to keep trust alive and the chain unbroken. XRP’s Unique Node List was built for precisely this balance: robust trust, minimal infrastructure, rapid recovery. Others will point to latency in space. Fair point. But the reality is that XRP’s low-overhead design can already bridge satellite networks on Earth, and its protocol is a natural fit for the coming age of interplanetary internet.

Ripple Labs has published independent audits showing XRP’s minuscule energy draw. University studies confirm that its consensus can run on minimal bandwidth and hardware. In disaster scenarios, its rapid re-sync protocol outperforms heavier blockchains, making XRP the closest thing to a lifeboat ledger the digital world has. When tested via satellite, XRP nodes were able to transmit and verify ledger updates with just a fraction of the bandwidth needed for legacy chains. The minimum number of validators required for network security is far lower than for proof-of-work networks, meaning recovery and off-grid operation are viable, not just theoretical.

As the world moves toward sustainability, and as we push toward the stars, the financial systems that will endure are the ones that ask the least of their environment. XRP doesn’t burn to earn. It doesn’t roar for attention. It is the protocol that endures in silence, a whisper between nodes, between worlds, ready to bridge the old world and the next. When the lights come back on, it’s the quiet current that will remain.

———

TLDR:
XRP is built for survival. It uses almost no energy, can recover from blackouts with minimal tech, and can run even over satellites. The consensus is light, robust, and works anywhere, even off world. Whether you’re new to crypto or deep in the tech, the truth is simple. When everything else fails, XRP endures quietly, ready for whatever comes next.

We officially broke up nearly a year ago, but it was messy and drawn out. I was dealing with a very serious life situation (can’t go into details) that made me feel like I couldn’t have a future with her, so I tried to end things. But she kept coming back, saying she wanted to fight for us. We went from exclusivity to being fwb which she was willing to settle for but I couldn’t keep doing it.  I felt like it was hurting her and I don’t like fwb situations but I didn’t know how to handle it. She wouldn’t let me go. I began emotionally withdrawing out of guilt and helplessness. Eventually, it ended with her feeling hurt and rejected, and me feeling like I pushed away the only person who really loved me. The last event was she was trying to schedule a trip together but that was too intimate for me so I tried to seem like I was busy but I gave her some conflicting answers, she called me out, I began getting defensive and she felt disrespected by what I said. 

She stopped messaging me and before I was gonna restart our typical loop of me apologizing and her thinking it means we’re back together, I thought why not have mercy on her and let her go. 

Months passed. I never stopped thinking about her. I figured out my situation. I missed her. I wanted to explain what had happened and how I’d changed. We hadn’t spoken in 6 months, except when I sent her a happy birthday message. I prob went too heavy cuz I sent her the Polaroid pic she gave on her birthday from last year and apologized for how things ended. She was surprisingly receptive said thanks and we chatted for a bit, she asked how I’ve been and then I made another mistake where I asked her to her to catch up over a birthday dinner a little too soon. Silence. 

After 3 days it was clear she wasn’t very interested and I crashed out and began over apologizing and explaining. She then responded 3 days after that saying she’s fine to listen and offer her opinions on things but she has a lot of stuff going on and doesn’t have the bandwidth to really help me with anything. I tried to scale back the seriousness and said I didn’t need help I just wanted to get her thoughts on some stuff and happy just get coffee  or a walk. 

4 days later, I caved and sent her a long, heartfelt message. I laid everything out. No pressure, just honesty, what I had gone through, how I felt, and that I still cared. I said if she ever wanted to talk, she could reach out. But I wouldn’t bother her again. It’s been over two days. No response. All this would have been better in person after we were on speaking terms but the fact that I couldn’t even get her to meet made me panic that this situation is hopeless cuz she prob still resents over the past and I thought I had to say something that might reframe how she might feel. This was so stupid. 

Now I’m spiraling.

I don’t know if she never saw the message (sent on a platform we talked on a lot but says message was delivered  ), or if she read it and just doesn’t care. I’m tortured by “what ifs.” I’m crushed. It hurts more than the breakup itself.

My questions:

1. What would have been a better way to reach out?

2. Is this situation totally hopeless now?
 
3. What’s really going on in her mind right now? I know nobody is a mind reader but if someone can help get some sort of bearing. My guess is she’s seeing someone so responding to me is not only difficult cuz I dumped a ton on her, it would be crossing a boundary with her current relationship. I’m only confused as to why she continued to talk to me, even pushing the convo forward at first.

4. Where do I go from here? No contact right? 

Any support or insights would mean a lot. I feel like I fumbled the only chance I had to make things right",2,1751121881.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1lmog6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/guam/comments/1lmog6r/thoughts_for_guam_after_first_hawaii_trip/,Thoughts For Guam After First Hawaii Trip,"I returned from a recent trip to Oahu, Hawaii. It was my first time seeing Hawaii. Here are my thoughts. 

First, Hawaii is way overpriced. Hotels there cost a terrible arm and leg. Not only do the hotels there charge high room rates, they have an absurd additional daily fee they charge to use the facilities like the pool. This is absurd, which is usually included in the room rate all over the world. 

Second, seasoned world travelers are probably familiar with this. There are different levels of what is considered acceptable breakfast all over the world, even comparing among hotels and resorts of the same class (5 stars vs 5 stars). Thats because every continent and region has its unique breakfast culture. In Europe, breakfast is served as just a bread like baguette or croissant with a coffee. That's what the common menu definition ""Continental breakfast"" means. Continental here refers to ""continental Europe"", the term is in English because it's basically coined by the British who live on an island (the British isles) referring to the people on the continent (the French, Germans and everyone else). Basically European breakfast is pathetic. Lean. Insubstantial. 

North American breakfast- much better than European but generally yogurt, toast, maybe one salad, sausages, pancakes, waffles, and an egg station. You can pay through your nose and stay in luxury hotels like Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons or St. Regis or Park Hyatt or Conrad in the US, the most sumptuous breakfast spread would just be that. In Asia and the Middle East, hotel breakfast is a luxury affair with a huge kaleidoscope of foods, and feature both western and the native asian cuisine of the country and one or two tables of food from neighboring countries. 

I paid over $4,000 after tax for a hotel in Waikīkī, the most touristy strip of Honolulu that is officially only four stars for eight nights. And even though the suite was very lovely (remodeled), the hotel itself was old. And what made me feel so much the whole experience was a rip off, was the awful North American breakfast on offer everyday, with the above that I describe - yogurt, one salad, bread with a toaster, tater tot's, the omelette station. They may switch the sausage with tater tots. Thats their idea of shaking things up. Thats it! Their token Asian item is miso soup, strange when Japanese tourists are a significant 
market of the tourism market of Hawaii. They don't even bother to change the items. They make you eat the same thing everyday. Even the fruit selection sucks. I couldn't believe I ate that for eight days in a row. I've always stayed in two star motels, three star Country Inn or Hampton's Inn, or AirBnb in the US. The Oahu trip was the first time I splurged on a nice hotel and suite so the experience was a bit of a shocker. I contrast the breakfast I got at Embassy Suites by Hilton in Waikiki to the variety and spread I got everytime I stay at PIC which has such a sumptuous spread because Guam caters to Asian tourists, and I'm just shocked by the difference. 

And the breakfasts you get in five star hotels in Asia and the Middle East, yes even when staying in the same big name western chains or Japanese luxury chains like Okura, is just mind blowing in comparison. 

Okay thats about the ""perceived value"" one gets comparing Hawaii and Guam. 

I did have fun checking out the various attractions on Oahu. There are apparently more things to do on Oahu, thats just a feature of the island being larger in size by double and having a resident population that is nearly a million, and thats not adding the over 9 million tourists that visit Hawaii which adds to the businesses (restaurants, bars, attractions, events) abilities to survive and thrive. The thing is, attractions like USS Memorial, Dole's pineapple plantation, Bishop's museum, Honolulu zoo, you will only go once, and unlikely to feel the urge to revisit them again. 

I didn't get to go to Maui or Big Island to comment on them. Guam's biggest strength is the laidback chill of the island that is visibly absent in Oahu and its eye-wateringly beautiful beaches, with water so clear yet so beautiful and turquoise and perfect for snorkeling, which you would go over and over again for repeat visits. Hawaii's waters are much deeper, with much stronger currents.
I kept waiting to be wowed by the beauty I heard so much about Hawaii when I was there, and I went away feeling somewhat ""meh"". It is beautiful in its own ways, but it wasn't exceptional in beauty when compared to Guam. 

With the population of Guam expected to increase from military build-up, there will be expected increased commercial activity that will be be generated benefiting businesses. And hopefully more businesses open. It is an eco-system. The increase in residents also have domino effect, bringing increased tourism.

I know, simply saying something that willfully ignorant is enough to make every boomer in the world clutch their pearls in shock and disgust; but it doesn’t make it any less true. No one my age actually or willingly reads books anymore. Sure, they’re foisted upon us in the classroom, and when we’re being monitored, we thumb through the weird smelling pages as we attempt to glean whatever information we can in the most archaic and painstakingly boring way possible, but it’s not like we’re thrilled to do it.

On our own, we would never be caught dead reading. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that I don’t think that I know any adults who still have the urge to crack open a book. It’s the twenty-first century! We have billion-dollar computers in our pockets; why would we bother with something as simple or pedestrian as some old, dusty, boring novel.

Do you know what’s easier than reading? Youtube. TikTok. Narrated summaries from all of the nerds out there who pretend to love it, make stupid videos about it, and teach you everything that you need to pass whatever test you have to take after you use some ChatGPT site to write your paper for you. We’re living in a digital age, and print is dead. Anyone who tries to tell you differently is a fossil who can’t figure out how to use a tablet or cellphone.

Or so I used to think.

I have no idea what brought me to that section of the library, or even what book I was hoping to find. I just know that I had no money, some time to kill, and thought maybe there could be a box of old comic books or something actually entertaining to look at as I waited for my next class. The narrow, dusty aisles crammed full of boring books of every shape and size seemed like an endless maze, and to be honest, I was more intrigued by the maze-like corridor than any story that might have been stacked in the shelves that lined the walls. Weaving up and down row after endless row, I was about to give up when something glinted in the overhead lighting and caught my eye.

It was a key. A small, silver key dangling from a bread twist-tie, hanging off what appeared to be a thumbtack that someone had pressed firmly into the wall and forgot about.

“Yoink.” I grinned to myself as I plucked it from its resting place and brought it closer to my eyes for a quick examination. It was a simple key, silver in color, and it looked as if it might fit a standard door lock. Glancing around the narrow, book-bricked aisle, I could see no immediate place to use it, so shrugging to myself I placed it back on its makeshift hook, where it promptly fell to the ground, clattering as loudly as a key that doesn’t belong to you will clatter when dropped.

Bending to pick it from the floor, I was just about to straighten when I noticed something odd: the bottom of the bookcase in front of me had a hinge. Furrowing my brow, I ran my fingers over the metal hinge plate and then looked up to confirm what I had already started to suspect. More hinges. This section of the bookcase could swing open, perhaps to close off the corridor, or more likely than not…

Finding the far end of the shelf where it butted against another identical row of old books, I gave a cursory tug to test for sort of resistance and was more than a little bit surprised when the bookcase itself, swung freely open. Behind the shelving, hidden from view was a fresh layer of dust and cobwebs, and a plain brown, unassuming door.

A forgotten janitor’s closet? Some sort of secret room? My mind spun with the possibilities as I pulled out my cell phone to document my adventures for the modest number of followers that I could normally reach, only to find the battery mostly dead and U2’s “Songs of Innocence” playing on silent loop.

I hate that album almost as much as I hate the phone that stubbornly restored it every single time that I tried to delete it. It was a stupid promo, and more than once I had to explain to someone why I had two half naked men hugging each other on my screen.

Cursing both Bono’s penchant for nudity and his name, I dropped my phone back into my pocket and tried the doorknob, which of course was locked. Loose and wobbly in my grip like it was about to snap off, I gave the knob another quick jiggle before remembering the silver key in my hand. Sliding it into the lock just to the side of the doorknob, it fit perfectly and turned with such ease, that for a half second it almost seemed to be doing so with a will of its own.

Peeking cautiously around the door’s frame revealed the small, boring room within. Lit by a round skylight and little else, it contained two comfortable looking but old chairs, a table, a dusty throw blanket, and a thick, leather bound book.

I had found a reading room, in a library. Huzzah.

Pulling the bookcase closed and quietly shutting the door behind me just in case this room was off limits, I found myself alone in the tiny study, marveling for a moment at how well the sky light really illuminated the place. Like the blanket, the chairs and tables were dusty, and the book looked old and worn.

“Every Book Ever Written”, I read out loud as I picked up the leather bound tome. *What a stupid title.* I smirked, cracking it open as I flopped heavily into the incredibly soft and inviting chair.

“The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play, so we sat in the house all that cold, cold wet day.” I read with bemusement as patters of rain began to fall above me, slapping against the skylight in clear, wet smudges. Even without the illustrations, I remembered the words from my childhood and found myself smiling at the familiarity of them.

“Why do you sit, sit in that chair?” A friendly, sing-song voice inquired, shattering the silence I hadn’t realized I had been enjoying. “Why do you sit, and at that book, stare?” It finished as I looked up, my eyes widening in heart pounding mixture of surprise and fear.

Towering above me stood the Cat in the Hat.

This wasn’t some cartoon or illustration, nor was it some actor in a suit. Looming over me, trying to read the very words on the page I held in my hands was an undeniably real, extremely large black and white cat-man *thing*. Upon its head, the creature wore a red striped hat and around its neck, a matching bowtie that it adjusted with two cat-like paws as it smiled down at me, awaiting my answer.

So, I screamed.

That was my only answer.

I screamed, loudly.

Panic inducing flight, I scrambled frantically over the side of the chair, falling to the floor. Leaping to my feet, I quickly skirted the room, avoiding the beast and flung open the door. The already loose doorknob rattled in the frame as I slammed it behind me, locking it as quickly as my frightened fingers would allow.

And then I ran.

I ran until I was out of the library, out of the building, out of the parking lot, and off school grounds. Fingers trembling, I sat in the coffee shop window, shakily holding a drink that I didn’t even remember ordering as I tried in vain to make any sense of what had just happened to me. Hallucination? No. That was real, I was certain of it. I’ve always hated the “dreaming” trope from television and movies, and I knew in my heart that nothing that big, or that real could be a hallucination or my mind playing tricks on me. I could hear its voice, smell its fur, and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was real.

The Cat in the Hat.

Obviously, I told no one. In fact, I avoided the library for at least solid week before my curiosity finally got the better of me. What if I had been hallucinating? What if I hadn’t? I had to know, and the only way to get any answers was to go back. Steeling myself against my own better judgement and fear, I stood up, resigned myself to my foolish bravery, and then waited another week and a half before finally working up the nerve to go back.

The library looked exactly the same as it had the day I fled, and as I hit the older section where I had stumbled upon the secret room, the only disturbances in the dust and debris that coated the floor were my footprints arriving, and hastily fleeing. Craning my neck and ensuring that I was still indeed alone, I reached for the bookcase and the now even more wiggly doorknob, unlocked the door and once again entered the small reading room.

Two chairs, a small table, and a leather bound book, but no Cat in the Hat.

Still on edge, but overcome with relief, I cautiously made my way to the chair and reached for the book.

“I’m going to open the book now.” I announced loudly, my voice echoing the empty room. “And I’m going to read it.” I cautioned, but my warning fell to my ears alone.

Opening the book, I frowned slightly as I looked down at the blank, empty page. Flipping through the book only brought more of the same discovery: it was blank.

“What the hell?” I grumbled, sitting in the chair as I closed the book at looked at the leather cover and title. “Every Book Ever Written” still embossed the dark binding, that hadn’t changed. Was I insane? Had I hallucinated? Opening the book with more than a little disappoint, my heart immediately began to pound.

Words graced the pages once more.

“Call me Ishmael?” I read out loud, the opening statement sound more like a question in my confusion.

“I knew a fella by that name.” A gruff, calloused voice informed me from the vicinity of the other chair. “Green hand. Was some sort of teacher, I think.”

Fear vibrating through my heart, I somehow managed to turn my head to the man now seated beside me in the second chair, but my own voice lay frozen in my throat.

He was a big, burly man, but noticeably older and greying. His skin was wizened and cracked as if he spent each and every day staring directly at the sun. A large, wicked looking scar ran the length of his face, before disappearing beneath the black, heavily button coat that he wore. He seemed almost comfortable as he wiggled in the chair, testing it with a few simple bounces before sinking back with a satisfied sigh.

“Captain Ahab.” I managed to squeak, my voice cracking.

“Aye.” He nodded, closing his eyes as he spoke.

“Am I going insane?” I asked, pulling myself to the furthest corners of my own chair as I studied him.

“Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.” He smiled, and I had no idea if he was quoting something or referencing the Cat in the Hat from before.

A shadow of something large passed overhead, blotting out the light from the window and drawing my eye upward just in time to see a massive black form as it crossed the glass that now appeared to be at the bottom of some vast ocean. Glancing down at the book in confusion, I was amazed to find my hand turning the pages as Captain Ahab continued to speak, almost as if I were providing the mechanism that allowed him his story; a child’s hand winding a toy.

We spoke for hours, and he told me of his life, his journey and the great white whale that plagued him. He knew of his own folly, his gruesome death and as I reached the final page in the book, he stood, smiled, and advised me to never let hate rule my heart.

And then he was gone.

From that moment on, I was hooked.

This room, this book; together they somehow brought to life the very world of whichever story appeared on the old, dog-eared pages. I had no conscious memory of ever actually reading, but instead learned the stories from the characters themselves as they narrated their own tale and my hands moved from chapter to chapter. I spoke strategy with long dead Generals, learned of wormholes and the cosmos from Space Pirates, laughed with jesters and fools, cried with every tragedy, and just between you and I, the day a steamy, smutty, trashy, romance novel appeared, let’s just say I developed a *passion* for reading.

As I learned, I felt myself beginning to change. My grades improved, my teachers were impressed with the knowledge that I had gained, almost as if I had witnessed the events firsthand. The lauded my insight, encouraged my reading, and on most days, I was all but sprinting to my secret study in hopes of furthering my thirst for knowledge and adventure.

How could I have been so naïve, so wrong? Print isn’t dead, it’s life itself, and I felt foolish for ever having thought otherwise.

As I greeted Alice, the Librarian, I made show of taking the long way to my studies, never once asking or inquiring about the room. It was mine now, and I had no interest in sharing it with anyone but the bevy of characters I had come to know and love. Thermos and two porcelain teacups in one hand and a full package of Mega-Stuffed Oreo cookies in the other, I crept down the forgotten section and quietly moved the bookcase.

The tea was something that I had stumbled across while reading. Mary Poppins herself sang of their merits and while most characters were content to share their stories, a spot of well-mannered encouragement as she put it, would go a long way in loosening them up. The Oreos however, were a happy little accident, and from the way Napoleon had polished off a whole sleeve in under a minute, I made a vow to never come here without them again.

Pulling open the bookcase, I produced the key and inserted into the simple lock as I had done a dozen times before, only to have it fall to the floor the moment I attempted to turn it. Frowning, I juggled my reading supplies and retrieved the key. This time it turned without fail and the door unlatched with a reassuring click. Smiling in anticipation, I turned the old brass knob, but to my dismay, it gave one last weakened wiggle before coming loose in my hand.

The screw bolt that held it in place was stripped. I had known for the last few weeks that this was a possibility and that I should repair it, but in my haste to read, I let it go. I had wrongfully assumed that if it were to break, it would have done so by now, and that more likely than not, it would last forever.

Carefully lining the metal tube on the end of the knob with its receptacle, I slowly and gingerly turned the doorknob, and to my relief, the door opened without further incident. Making a mental note to stop by the hardware store on my way home, I stepped into my now very clean, very comfortable room and gently closed the bookcase and door behind me.

Almost as if performing some sacred ritual, I placed the teacups upon the table, each close to one of the chairs, and poured two cups of perfectly brewed tea. Exchanging the cookies for the book of “Every Book Ever Written”, I pulled the blanket close around me, snuggled down into the chair and smiled as the pages came to life.

“The terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight years – if it ever did end – began, so far as I know or can tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspaper floating down a gutter swollen with rain.” I read slowly, my heart thumping in almost immediate recognition.

An icy ripple of pure fear blossomed up my spine like frost slowly overtaking a pane of glass. Slamming the book closed as quickly as humanly possible I shot a panicked glance to the other chair and then around the room to confirm that I was still alone.

Only silence, an empty chair, some cookies and two steaming cups of tea answered.

“Well, this isn’t happening.” I vowed as I leapt from the comfortable chair, bolted the short distance across the room and yanked on the doorknob with strength born of fear.

To my absolute horror, it came off in my hand. From the other side I heard a clatter and a heavy thud as the second half of the doorknob broke free.

I started to curse, but my blood ran cold as a giggle rang out behind me. Light, amused, and almost musical in its notes, the disembodied laughter was more than enough to cause my vulgarities to fall from numbed lips. Eyes closed, my breath refusing to leave my chest, I slowly turned towards the direction of the sound and forced myself to look.

Beyond the normal furnishings, the room was blessedly empty, and I felt my heart begin to beat once more. It was still just me, the tea and cookies, the two old and battered chairs, and the very top of the object that was slowly rising from behind them.

1lmobwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1lmobwi/im_a_driver_i_snapped_today_and_went_rogue_on_the/,"Im a driver, I snapped today and went rogue on the app","I finally couldn't stand how poor the app is.  I had a double pickup from two places.  Customer 1 has piping hot food, and the second pickup is seamlessly on the route to him. Customer 1 lives less than 1 mile from the second pickup.  

The little coffee shop is very crowded, the order isn't started, and will take likely 10 min atleast.  What can a driver do within app features?  

Option 1 - greed:  wait out the second order.  Let the first sit and cool down.  Hit up the app for a free $3 for enduring a wait.  The risk is customer downvoting you or removing the tip.  It was about $8 tip for a small order going 3 miles.  

Option 2 - selflessness: cancel the second order so another driver can get it, deliver the first order.  Lose out on the $8 order you canceled and receive the penalty of +1% to your cancelation rate.  

Uber app specifically blocks any communication of driver and customer when on pickup for another order.  Ie. While waiting for pickup 2, I hard cannot contact customer 1 in any way, like to ask for his address and deliver it pronto.   

Got sick and tired slamming into Ubers ceiling of intelligence, Option 3 rogue.  Tell the app you've picked up order 2, so that it shows me customer 1.  Drop off piping hot food to customer 1.  Message customer 2 when I get back to their coffee shop pickup and let them know the little situation and that I'm still waiting for their order, despite it looking like I'm ""on the way"".  Customer 2, a regular, thanks me for the updates.

Both customer got hot food.  Within the parameters of the uber app functionality,  it was impossible to earn the total offer and provide good service.  Letting food get cold for 10+ min while youre half a mile down the road is what Uber customer service is all about.  Then they will deny your refund when its cold, claiming it was ""on time"" because they kept upping the ETA while waiting on a second pickup.  

As I said, smart people literally hit a ceiling of intelligence with the uber app.  We have to go outside the box.  Finesse the apps functionality.  And make executive decisions that are for people who take themselves and their service serious.  This is not the first time ive had to do things like this to better serve customer.  

Just enjoy breaking down and exposing how embarrassingly insufferable the app is if you have 1/8th of a brain.  Do better uber.  Bad service is not a good look.  

I take a slight pride, even if it is stupid, in 100% satisfaction.  

Ps. I dont read replies or respond in a topic once I've posted. Usually it just drives me to argue, which is a waste of this short life.  ",1,1751121440.0,UberEATS,6,0.55,False

Many models also come equipped with an integrated milk frothing system, adjustable settings, and touch-screen displays for easy operation.

The PrimaDonna range includes several models, such as the **PrimaDonna Soul**, **PrimaDonna Elite**, and **PrimaDonna Class**, each offering slightly different features, price points, and technical specifications.

# Key Features

* **Bean-to-Cup System:** The machine grinds fresh coffee beans for each cup, enhancing flavor and aroma.
* **Integrated Milk Frother:** Ideal for milk-based drinks like cappuccinos and lattes. Many models include automatic milk carafes that self-clean.
* **Customizable Drinks:** Users can adjust coffee strength, temperature, and milk froth levels to suit personal preferences.
* **Touch-Screen or App Control:** Higher-end models feature full-color touch displays or smartphone app compatibility for remote control.
* **Automatic Cleaning Functions:** To reduce maintenance efforts, most models offer self-cleaning options for both the milk system and coffee unit.

# Pros

* Consistent coffee quality with minimal effort
* Broad drink selection, from espresso to milk-based beverages
* Freshly ground beans for every cup
* Easy-to-use interface, especially on newer models
* Sleek, premium build that fits well in modern kitchens

# Cons

* Price point is relatively high, making it an investment
* Larger footprint may not suit smaller kitchens
* Regular cleaning still required despite automated processes
* Replacement parts or repairs can be expensive
* Not ideal for those who enjoy manual brewing methods

# Who is it for?

The PrimaDonna series is best suited for individuals or families who drink coffee daily and appreciate barista-style beverages at home. It's particularly useful for those who prefer convenience over manual brewing techniques. That said, it may not appeal to coffee purists who enjoy using manual espresso machines, pour-over methods, or experimenting with grind size and pressure.

# Final Thoughts

The [DeLonghi Prima Donna](https://latteholic.com/collections/delonghi) machines provide a reliable, convenient way to enjoy café-style drinks at home, though they come with a premium price tag. They are designed for those who value ease of use and consistent results over hands-on coffee-making experiences.

Can you recommend some spots that play these type of genres? I love listening to Open Mic Acoustic, Indie Rock, Indie Folk, Indie Pop, Indie Acoustic, all that kind of stuff. Like SiriusXM Coffee House type vibes.

I looked on reddit about places people recommended in the past for this type of music, like Basement East, Marathon Music Works, and Blue Room Bar, but I am looking at the line-ups for the next month or so and they don't have artists doing the type of music I'm looking for.

I've also heard people recommend New Heights Brewing Company, but I went last Wednesday and it is miserable hot outside, and the sound system is on such low volume it was a total waste of time.

I'm just looking for a cool indoor place, to listen to some indie musicians play their original stuff or maybe a few covers sprinkled in there as well. I'm looking for that SiriusXM coffee house vibe. Or if you ever heard of the Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles, they have the type of musicians I like to hear too.

I’m a 29-year-old female living in Munich. I’m originally from abroad and have been here for about 1.5 years now. While I really enjoy the city, I’d love to make more female friends to share good conversations, laughs, and experiences with.

I speak both English and German, so happy to connect in either language!

A bit about me: I enjoy cozy tea/coffee chats, exploring new spots around the city or nature, weekend markets, casual walks, museums, or just relaxing and having a nice conversation. I’m always curious to try something new.

Hello, I (19F) haven’t seen my ex best friend of three years (19F) since we went to different universities, but I stopped by my hometown today to get boxes for my new apartment and stopped for coffee where I thought she used to work, turns out she still works there. I thought we had ended on okay terms, we outgrew each other and that was all. But when I went back inside the store to pick up a couple more sugars I see her speed away to the back and completely avoid me which I thought was strange. I get a text from her about 15 minutes later after I’ve left telling me not to come by while she’s working and that she doesn’t want to associate with me or anyone else I know. I’m still trying to rack my brain for things I could have done so horribly that she would run away from me when I’m not even particularly trying to interact with her. We had a mutually unhealthy friendship at times since we both had anorexia/bulimia and would discuss it and relapse/recover together on and off. I still don’t understand what would give her the impression I want to become friends again or even acquaintances and why it would require an entire paragraph of a text to tell me not to come by her work, as if I knew she was working and went out of my way to be petty. I don’t hold any kind of ill will towards her and don’t intend on going back, I’m just confused and a bit ache-y inside at the thought that I did something terrible and don’t know what it is. I’m almost positive it’s not the eating disorder part as we had a whole friend group that would discuss our eating habits and feelings, me and her were just a bit closer than the others. I just know she’s going to talk badly about me to her coworkers, post about it on her social media vaguely and talk about me to our past friends about me which makes me feel gross.",6,1751120949.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I'm a mere teenager and I have no idea if I'm even posting this on the right side of the internet.
 I was drinking my morning energy drink and was thinking: if one combined matcha or green tea, both are proven to have trace amounts of caffeine, without the side effects, with say energy drink powder, would that cancel out the ""let down"" of productivity/dopamine/motivation that happens a couple hours when you have coffee or an energy drink by itself. 
Please tell me if I should post this in a different thread if needed, or tell me why my idea would or wouldn't work. I'm genuinely just curious.

Edit: I've been told that you can't really combine the two to get results. And a better description of the ""let down"" or ""caffeine crash"" would be the side effects I’m referring to (maybe they only affect me, or certain people idk) are more like a steady decline in focus, or motivation. It often can leave you more drained than when you initially drank it. Even though most drink it to wake up. At least that’s the best way I can describe it when I drink caffeine 

So my new question would be more along the lines of:

Spaceinator (already at the door):

Spaceinator (off to the side):
“Sir, it’s actually a bit to the left.”

[Dorian turns his head. Sure enough—a glitchy, half-crumbled ship flickers in and out next to a crack in reality.]

Dorian:
“…I see. Good work, Spaceinator.”

“What I don’t get is how I’m supposed to find clues on some old galleon-styled starship.”

“They used a four-digit terminal access key, sir.”

Spaceinator:
“No, sir.”

Dorian:
“Eh. Let’s just chalk it up to vacation. They’ve been saving the galaxy long enough. Maybe they just needed a break.”

Sorry for the cheesy line above, haven't had some good cheese on a pizza in a while. Please bear with me and take a few minutes to read through. Thank you.

I'm a simple 5'8 bengali guy navigating through life and it's difficulties one day at a time. Pretty logical, practical and straight forward guy but kind of a hopeless romantic at heart stuck in the 90's unable to fit into this dating and hookup culture of today. Bit of an introvert who doesn't talk a whole lot socially, I'm someone who would love to yap with you on anything and everything.

**More insights on me:**

\- I love binge watching movies, shows etc (though I don't get much time these days)

\- Into gymming and sports. Currently enjoy playing badminton weekly. Would love if you would join me for a workout or a game of shuttles

\- Love long drives (especially with family) with music on and yapping about things. Destination is not important, the journey is.

\- I have a playful, childish side — one of my love languages is to playfully annoy and bother you

\- Eggitarian, left meat few years back

\- Big time animal lover, hence the renouncing of meat

\- Spiritual/Religious (Hindu), really like visiting temples and soaking in the energies

\- Abhor smoking, drink very rarely and socially -> can forego if it's a requirement for you

\- I know and can do all chores around the house.. mom raised me right.. I don't ever shy away from responsibilities

\- more in store for you to explore and figure out, nothing erratic or out of ordinary though

**My bad habits-**

I'll probably approach and pet that cow on the road if I see one. dogs too.

I need a long time to properly get to my senses in the morning.. I'll be holding you captive till then

I may whine like a child if I'm sleep deprived or hungry.

I'll send you a lot of reels

**What I’m Looking For:**

Someone to call my home. Someone who I can bury my head into after a long and tiring day. Someone who believes in building a relationship brick by brick, doesn't shy away from having the harder conversations and willing to work through things. My partner in crime, my best friend, who’s calm, emotionally mature, and is my rock and anchor. Looking for warmth, laughter, and the kind of love that grows stronger with time with all the highs and lows.

Brownie points for nerdy, geeky and intellectual conversations. I love ingesting trivial pieces of information about anything, which I'll bombard you with too. Do I remember it all? Nope.. which brings me to, I'm quite forgetful, but I won't forget any important dates tho, be it your bdays, our anniversary or your parents's bdays.. If you were to ask me if I remember what you wore on our last date, I'd probably be scrambing to find an answer. I would likely remember something cute or embarassing you did 10yrs back or so tho..haha..

I’m looking to get married within 1-2 years and definitely want kids in the future. Also jfyi, I won't be asking for dowry/gifts and I'd prefer a small private marriage, not a gala.

**Partner Preferences-**

Religion: Hindu

Age: 24-28

Height: <=5'7

Spiritual/Religious

Occupation: Would prefer someone who's not stuck in the corporate 9-5 rut like me, but mostly anything is fine.

Loves animals -> I have found that people who love animals are generally more empathetic and compassionate, so it's a plus

Community: I would love to be a part of yours and I expect you to welcome bengali culture too. The more festivals we can celebrate together, the better.

I would like someone who believes in family values, wants to have a family of her own and has dreams/visions of a marriage and life after, not just a wedding. It's just me and my mom and she's one of the sweetest people you could ever meet. So, I need someone who isn't tainted by the idea that all MILs are abusive towards their DILs or all guys are mumma's boys if they live with their parents. My mom has always wanted a daughter, so you'll be treated as such. Your parents are my parents too (I'm great with parents, yes will be with yours too) and I expect you to love my mom as your own too.

**Why marry me:**

\- If your idea of fun looks something like going on a hike, going for a drive or travel occassionally or explore places, be at home and spend time with family etc. instead of clubbing, partying, socializing extensively

\- Lifetime supply of cuddles and massages

\- If you're someone who would like to stay awake late in the night with a cup of coffee talking, binge watching something or watching stupid reels together

\- If you believe in building something solid, a relationship from the ground up, nurture it like a sapling and watch it grow into a strong tree standing tall

(This is a third-person crime scene script. Most characters, or in this case eyewitnesses, are yet to be named except the homeroom teacher Miss Tetsuko Sazama.)

**Setting:**  
In the city of \*\*\*, Japan, A high school on a quiet Thursday morning, before the school day begins by the bell at 8:00 AM. The air is light and cool. A horrific discovery on the third floor will soon disrupt the peaceful routine.

**Timeline and Events**

**6:00 AM**: The janitor/groundskeeper arrives, unlocks the school gates, opens the main entrance, and briefly checks the first-floor windows. They then head to the fields behind the school, retrieving tools from the utility shack to begin maintenance work.

**6:10 AM**: The second janitor, an older man, arrives and starts his cleaning routine in the entrance hall at 6:25 AM, sweeping the floor.

**6:50 AM**: The PE teacher, dressed in running clothes, enters the school ground, circle around to the back and stops at the vending machine behind the school to grab a water bottle, then begins her morning jog on the field.

**7:10 AM**: Tetsuko Sazama, a third-year homeroom teacher, arrives with a fresh coffee in her hand and sits on a bench outside, enjoying the morning calm.

**7:15 AM**: A female student, a junior who’d made a habit of arriving early—partly for peace, partly to avoid home–enters the school. She greets Ms. Sazama, changes her shoes in the entrance hall, and passes the older janitor as she heads upstairs.

**7:18 AM**: The crime scene is discovered.

**Moments leading up to the Discovery of the Crime Scene**

At 7:15 AM, the student climbs the stairs toward the third floor. At the junction between the second and third floors, a sharp, metallic smell stops her. She notices red streaks on the walls, then sees a body sprawled across the stairs, damp with dark thick blood. Frozen in shock, she collapses to her knees, her voice catching before a single, piercing scream escapes.

The older janitor, sweeping in the entrance hall, hears the scream and drops his broom. He climbs the stairs, his steps heavy, and finds the student on the floor, trembling and pale, her uniform damp from shock. The sight of the body hits him hard; his breath quickens, and he grabs the student’s arm, guiding her shaky descent to the first floor.

Outside, Ms. Sazama hears the scream and sets her coffee down, now startled. She hurries toward the entrance, only to meet the janitor and student emerging from the school. The student is unresponsive, and the janitor, overwhelmed, his old legs gives up on the paved ground. Ms. Sazama, her voice rising in panic, tries to ask what happened but gets no clear answers.

The commotion reaches the PE teacher on the field. She stops and walks to the front entrance, finding one of the student on a bench, shaking, with the janitor slumped nearby and Ms. Sazama kneeling beside them. The PE teacher asks what’s going on, and Ms. Sazama, still shaken, eyes fixated on the old janitor’s thick sausage fingers pointing towards the entry. Now united with the familiar face, together with the PE teacher, Tetsuko enters the school, following a trail of sparkling golden liquid on the floor and up the stairs. The metallic smell grows stronger on the second floor, and on the third, they take a glimpse of what appears to be a rather dreadful sight. Reeling, they stumble back outside, gasping for breath.

**The Aftermath**

By 7:25 AM, another teacher and two more students arrive. They see the student in shock on the bench and the janitor struggling to sit up. One student offers a sip to the girl from her bottle, while the teacher helps the janitor sit upright. The groundskeeper, now audibly hearing the racket from the other side of the fields, gives in to her curiosity, comes and joins the group at the front. Shortly after, Ms. Sazama and the PE teacher emerge from the school, pale and breathless, urging someone to call the police.

For the next 15 minutes, the group kept arriving students and staff away from entering the school. The growing crowd stands in stunned silence, grappling with dread and cold chatter. Ms. Sazama tries to contact the vice principal, reaching voicemail–who were supposed to be at the airport, departing to Europe for an International seminar–she leaves a brief notice, and begs for them to call back as early as possible.

**Police Arrival and School Closure**

At 7:40 AM, the first batch of the police arrive, their sirens cutting through the morning air. Officers secure the ground, taping off the entrance. Paramedics tend to the student and the older janitor, escorting them to the aid car for transport to a nearby clinic for evaluation. As the police take control, Ms. Sazama and the other staff begin to process the gravity of the situation. For Ms. Sazama, the shock that gripped her since the unfinished morning coffee starts to ease, as if she can finally take a breath again. She gets an urgent call from the principal, confirming what she claimed earlier in her voicemail. Then after receiving the principal’s approval, she and the other staff inform the gathered students outside that the school is closed until further notice and ask them to stay at home at least until the next Monday. By 9:00 AM, the detective begins questioning staff as the school grounds now crowded with the badges, cordoned off.

1lmnu7i,https://i.redd.it/46odvrm7fo9f1.jpeg,Day 5 and Night 4 recap (3 days post op from 2 day 360 L5/S1),"Happy Saturday fam, 

I just want to give a quick update on how the fifth day went and some updates from last night.   

Last night first, so after my early morning update yesterday I spent most of the day just feeling kind of tired and manageable pain for the most part probably like a six out of 10 sometimes before.  As the day progressed I managed to get my pain management cycle  back in place which helped tremendously. 

My biggest goal yesterday was to just try and hopefully get a BM.... Which I finally did late last night.  I'll tell you what friends, if last night around 7:00 Central my pain was an eight for those numbers were strictly from just being bloated from not using the restroom.  I was on like day four of stool softeners, and I added in some dulcolax chews, along with the vortex function on my bidet.... And I was able to finally get rid of what felt like a whole another human in terms of weight and I immediately felt better everywhere in my body.  

Following that I was able to really healthy dinner with a lot of protein and fiber, and for the first time I managed to sleep more than 2 hours straight.  Fell asleep about midnight and I slept till 5:00 with a zero interruptions by laying on my side and using a pillow between my legs.   

Waking up this morning pain is incredibly manageable I'm probably like a four right now at the 10, but I feel more mobile and agile and all of my incisions are itching really bad which is indicating healing to me.  I don't appear to have a lot of information or redness anywhere but I'm blaming those on the peptides, and I was able to do a ton of walking and stairs today.  

Currently giving myself a break because I did too much up and down and walking so far so just chilling I'm going to continue making sure I'm taking lots of fiber, and I'm going to re-up my peptide stack and about an hour or so. 

What  I'm really hoping for is by the time I see my surgeon again on the 10th, I'll be able to share that I've had some elevated healing times because of the peptides and maybe we can have a default stack for this community for folks that are going through this type of surgery.  

I will say and I hate this I find myself accidentally twisting to look over my shoulder all the time and it's so hard to stop it. I'm also constantly second-guessing the way I log rolls and I'm worried I might have twisted something the wrong way because I feel a little bit of a pull.... But I just keep reminding myself that as long as I'm not overdoing it and doing it intentionally it's not going to have that much of an impact.  These things aren't designed to fail so I'm using that as comfort when I feel like I make a mistake.... But I'm also trying to be really good about being more mindful. 

The other hard part about today and even yesterday that I'm really starting to struggle with, is a hate having to ask people to do things for me.  Small things to like help me scoot my chair up, can you reach under the counter and get the coffee filter, do you mind filling up this jug with water, can you help me get my shirt on etc. Most of my life I've been the one doing things for other people and I go out of my way to make sure the people I care about don't have to work too hard for me... So pretty massive adjustment to have that mindset flipped upside down and no other way for it to function this is just my life right now.  

All in all fam I'm feeling great, I've got mostly good energy, and my stability just feels out of this world still today no nerve pain whatsoever.

**Health and Wellness: New Insights and Preventative Measures**

A significant portion of the news focused on health and wellness, offering practical advice and highlighting cutting-edge research. One critical concern addressed was parasitic tapeworms, with a doctor emphasizing the potential for transmission from animals to humans. This underscores the importance of preventative measures and awareness regarding zoonotic diseases.

Several reports emphasized the importance of proactive health management. Lifestyle correction, particularly in early life, was presented as a necessity rather than an option. Experts underscored the value of understanding drug efficacy, side effects, and who benefits most from specific medications. This was complemented by news regarding a neurologist's checklist for safe passage, likely offering guidelines for assessing and managing potential health risks.

Regarding the rising cases of obesity and its related health conditions, a neurologist highlighted the importance of comprehensive management. Shuffling food intake was also shown to improve blood sugar regulation, suggesting innovative strategies for dietary control. Research into weight loss interventions continued, with studies demonstrating that semaglutide pills and Mounjaro shots led to weight loss of almost 10 to 15 percent in users. Additionally, reports indicated that orforglipron, a smaller molecule, may offer improved drug absorption through the gut.

Addressing long-standing health concerns, a neurologist explained aneurysms, AVMs, and trigeminal neuralgia, clarifying complex medical conditions and encouraging public awareness.

The news also shed light on specific health recommendations. Drinking coffee without sugar or cream was found to reduce the risk of death by 14 percent. Moreover, a new report highlighted the impact of tobacco control efforts in protecting the health of 6.1 billion people worldwide.

**Medical Advancements and Trials**

Medical breakthroughs were also a prominent feature of the news cycle. Phase 3 trials yielded positive results, revealing that 99.9% of participants remained HIV-negative with two annual shots. This represents a significant advance in HIV prevention.

Another piece of news detailed a crew's plans to conduct medical experiments in space, focusing on human health and performance. This reflects a broader trend towards exploring the effects of the space environment on the human body, providing information for future space missions.

However, the news also highlighted some of the challenges associated with this technology. ChatGPT users were observed to become increasingly reliant on copy-and-paste methods, suggesting potential implications for the quality and depth of work. The implications of AI were also explored, with the New York Times featuring an interview with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who touched on the capabilities and limitations of Artificial Intelligence.

**Misinformation and Alternative Perspectives**

The news highlighted the importance of critical thinking and awareness of misinformation. Social media, in particular, was identified as a source of exaggerated or misrepresented risks associated with everyday products such as sunscreens and perfumes.

Despite the overwhelming amount of scientific information, one of the sources mentioned an alternative therapy, suggesting that even practitioners of science rely on it to find balance.
