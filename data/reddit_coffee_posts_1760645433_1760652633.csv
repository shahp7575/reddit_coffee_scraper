I realized I'd been wanting human connection then too. I remembered that I always felt pretty lonely, even in a room full of people. People I actually knew and who knew me, too. 

I had convinced myself the last couple years that this loneliness was a new thing. That over the past decade, I had lost nearly every meaningful connection I had with someone in some way. Honestly, some days that thought stream really beat me over the head. I started to almost convince myself that I was just a wildly unlikeable thing. 

I came here not with much intent to speak to anyone but to voyeur at the loneliness of others. Pretty shitty, I know. My intentions weren't malicious. I was looking for kindred spirits from the wallpapered corner of the party, so to speak. 

I've had a change of heart. Reading all your posts, it helped me dig around the bins of my brain. I was able to objectively look at the social sector of my life. (I'm not sure how it happened really - both Freud and Jung would have answers, I'm not sure if like either.) What I realized is very simple.

**I am not the wildly unlikeable thing, and neither are any of you.** 

Thank you for that. Everyone who posted anything here. 

Some of my favorite things are: 
Reading (with special interest in Poetry and...well, philosophy I suppose. You ever thought about how an Anarchist society would protect itself from major threats? Have you ever read a haiku in translation so touching you literally cried?)

The vast and endless genre of RPG games 
Classic tabletop games (Yahtzee anyone?) 

Coffee. That is all. 

Animals of all kind (including a penchant for bugs and snakes)

Documentaries (particularly True Crime and loooonnnnggggg historical works)

Horror Films! 

Painting (I've recently started learning my way with watercolor)

Health and Wellness (I've been doing this semi Carnivore thing, it's an interesting journey. Wanna talk about it?)

Wandering the world with my partner and feline fur child


It's really hard to write about yourself in this way and I did my best. I will warn you I am supportive and loving, but direct in ways that can sometimes be off putting. I am not constantly glued to my phone, but I will always text or call you back. I've heard I'm pretty funny. 

 I see you, you know. Whoever read this far. Not in the literal weird fucking way but in the way that something in me recognizes something in you. It's nice, I swear.

Wanna talk and hang out for a bit?

I’m 24F and had been drinking coffee daily since I was 12yo— so, about 12 years (approximately 200mg of caffeine daily). I’ve also had pretty severe anxiety/panic disorder for about the same amount of time. This past summer was the worst my mental health has ever been. I was having multiple daily panic attacks, completely falling apart, even suicidal at points. I didn’t necessarily plan to quit caffeine — I was so anxious I just stopped being able to tolerate it and much food in general around this time. But I believe I quit around July 11th. Here’s my timeline: 

First 3 days: absolute hell. Nausea, migraines, fatigue, panic attacks, constipation (didn’t poop for a week, fun times).

Days 4–7: headaches, fatigue, still constipated, still anxious but the nonstop panic attacks stopped.

Weeks 2–3: this is when I noticed a massive shift — like my brain finally exhaled. I felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. I had energy. I could focus again. I could sit through a full movie without scrolling on my phone. My periods even got better — less cramping, PMS, breast tenderness. I wasn’t suicidal anymore. I finally felt what being a “normal person” must feel like for maybe the 1st time since entering adulthood. 

Weeks 4–6: things leveled out a bit. The euphoria faded but I still felt so much better than before — calmer, steadier, actually enjoying things again. 

Then month 2 hit: out of nowhere I started sliding into a different kind of struggle. I think it’s depression? I’ve never had that before — only anxiety. Suddenly I felt super low, insecure, tired, and emotionally flat. Like my soul got vacuumed out by a dementor. All the same dark thoughts as before, but now no panic, just this heavy acceptance of them. Apathetic, joyless, kinda hollow.

Now I’m just over 3 months caffeine-free (quit around July 11) and still in this low place that I’ve been in for a little over a month now. The anxiety and panic are still gone — which is good — but the depression is rough. I’m wondering if this is my new normal or if anyone has had a similar experience? 

Has anyone else had this happen? Like a month or two after quitting caffeine you suddenly hit a depressive wall? Does it even out again? I’d love to hear if anyone’s had a similar experience or any advice/tips.  ",1,1760651726.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

(I had replied this entire thing to another comment in this sub so I thought I may as well just post it here).

This is everything I did! Some of it’s very detailed, some of it isn’t—so you can ask me if you have anyone questions! If you can’t tell, I really am happy I was able to do this 😊 and I’m well aware everybody has different bodies and genetics so I have no idea if this would work for anyone else, but having said that—i really hope this can help someone on this sub—this was my diet before:

I had been doing a regimen where I was eating two fried eggs (pasture raised), avocado, berries, a whey protein drink with 2% fairlife milk  (Ballerina farm vanilla bean protein powder—not a fan of their politics but I bought it 😬 😬) and decaf instant coffee with grassfed half ‘n half as my breakfast/lunch. 

Dinner was a turkey burger(no bun)/ground turkey/Bilinksi brand wild mushroom chicken sausage (rotated between all of those) with a cauliflower, broccoli, & carrot blend with pecorino romano on top, plus some sort of protein dessert on some days (egg based mug cake made w stevia). Sometimes magic spoon cereal. Sometimes very dark chocolate (95%).

Snacks were nitrate/nitrite free grassfed turkey jerky, I was starting to eat more cheese (these Bellgioiso “snacking cheeses” of Parmesan—bc they’re high protein)

Ok now for what I did! I did some research on foods and supplements to lower ldl (a lot of it from this sub) and it went like this:

Supplements:

Yerba Prima brand organic whole psyllium husks—drink 10 grams mixed with water (2 tbls) 
/Beta Glucan
/Citrus Bergamot

Breakfast/lunch:

Actual Veggies brand bean burger— “super green burger”

Siggis plain fat free skyr yogurt
Walnuts/honey
Berries

(Sometimes avocado)

Whey protein powder w Malk brand almond milk & water 

Better Oats brand oatmeal— quick cook steel cut oatmeal with flax seeds (I eat half at lunch, save half for dinner)

Pu-erh tea (numi organic) after lunch (Other teas sometimes— 
Roasted dandelion root 
/Hibiscus

Dinner is half the portion of oatmeal (I eat it “savory”: just with Celtic sea salt) plus something bean-based & carrot/broccoli/cauliflower blend with nutritional yeast & c. sea salt

Dessert I like to do is banana mixed with cacao powder and peanut powder/“healthy” hot chocolate: cacao powder w c. salt, stevia, hot water, almond milk

Also eating: lentils /Brown rice /Seed crackers/ Tofu /Salmon (my protein sources are now bean based but I will sometimes add salmon to these meals in addition) avocado /Apple /Chickpea pasta (Chickapea brand) /Baba ganoush

Three Wishes cereal (plain) as a snack (Chickpea, tapioca, pea protein, salt)

Only Gaea cold pressed EVOO used sparingly for oil

Not frying anything anymore

Cut out greatest components of saturated fat:

pasture raised eggs/nitrate-nitrite free organic beef jerky-turkey jerky/grassfed half ‘n half/lean ground turkey/pecorino Romano cheese/parmesan cheese/partial fat Greek yogurt/partial fat farmer cheese/95% organic dark chocolate/ghee

There’s conflicting advice about all of this stuff. This was just an experiment that turned out well. Some on this sub say full fat dairy and dark chocolate have no effect on cholesterol, but I didn’t do a true elimination diet so I don’t know what the main culprits were. I just focused on adding a lot of soluble fiber and reducing saturated fat as much as possible.

I'm another UN staffer (currently HQ) who have been in the UN context for several years, and here's what I have kept noticing every time I have coffee chats or drinks after work with colleagues - the only real talk about burnout, toxic management, or promotion struggles happens in whispered chats. It's quite hard to get honest career advice on internal platforms that are full of the 'highlight reel'....hence we constantly self-censor.

So, I built **Unbox:Community**—the secure coffee corner we always needed. It's a completely **free** mobile app.

Here’s core values of this tool:

* **Verified UN/IO Staff Only:** You verify once using your official UN/IO email suffix (MDBs included). This makes the community exclusive to colleagues, so the advice and information shared are super reliable and relevant.
* **Unbreakable Anonymity:** Your verification email and profile are separated and cryptographically hashed. The admin (that's me!) cannot link your posts to your email. This means true freedom to discuss career-critical topics.
* **Agency-Specific Plazas:** Get hyper-relevant insights from colleagues in your exact agency in their private Plaza.

I built this because I genuinely believe having a safe space for honest professional voices is critical for better decisions and career longevity. And that's how valuable your honest review and feedback would be :) Therefore...give it a try and tell me what you think I should prioritize next! (It's 100% free and I believe the app complies with the 'free tool' rule here - feel free to let me know otherwise)

**Heads up: Since I literally just launched the app a few weeks ago, the feeds are still quiet! So please be my guest to kick things off!**

1o8jdrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1o8jdrr/passed_pmp_today_my_3year_journey_a_baby_and_a/,"Passed PMP Today — My 3-Year Journey, a Baby, and a Stress Test Story","The fire was lit about three years ago when I was rejected for a Senior PM interview.  
I’ve been doing a PM role for quite some time, but the reason for rejection was simple: *“No formal certification.”*

Getting rejected in an interview? I can live with that.  
But not even getting a shot? That was heartbreaking.

So I decided to earn this “so-called PMP certificate” everyone’s crazy about — and made myself a 6-stage roadmap:

**Stage 1** – Google PM  
**Stage 2** – Professional Scrum Master  
**Stage 3** – PMI CAPM  
**Stage 4** – PMI ACP  
**Stage 5** – PRINCE2  
**Stage 6** – PMI PMP

I completed my Google PM in 2022, but like everyone else — *life happened.*  
We were blessed with a beautiful baby girl, and all resources (especially time) were happily redirected toward her.  
No complaints — she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I’d trade a hundred certificates just to see her smile.

Fast-forward to this year — I picked things up again and completed my PSM in May.  
After a short break, I began preparing for CAPM around August. I was consistently scoring 85%+ on CAPM mocks, then took a PMP mock (dont remember the free website) — scored about 60%.  
That’s when it hit me if I push hard enough, I can go straight to **Stage 6 (PMP)**.

Like most aspirants, I went through **Andrew Ramdayal** and **David McLachlan’s** Udemy courses — mindset, 150/200 questions, drag and drop, etc.

This community was a *game changer.*   
I was torn between TIA or Study Hall — and followed what most success stories here recommended: **Study Hall**.  
That was *the single most important decision* for cracking the PMP exam.

Here are my mock scores:

* **Mock 1** – 70%
* **Mock 2** – 78%
* **Mock 3** – 76%
* **Mock 4 (Stress Test)** – 60%
* **Mock 5** – 76%

I reviewed every correct and incorrect answer and usually finished about 20 minutes early.

# The “Stress Test” Story

A week before the exam, I started losing sleep.  
At that point, I still had Mock 4 & 5 left. That’s when I decided to do what I called a **Stress Test**.

Starting Friday, Oct 10 (7 days before my exam), I stayed awake for 24 hours straight — working, studying, walking, and drinking coffee whatever it took.  
Then I gave Mock 4. By the end, I’d been awake for about 29 hours!

What did I learn?  
1) I can perform under extreme fatigue.  
2) I can still finish all questions within time.

From Saturday night onward, I reset my sleep schedule and slept *really well* before the actual exam (9 hours straight ).

# The Real Exam

Agile heavy.  
Zero drag-and-drop.  
Zero calculation.  
Zero “easy” questions.

Roughly:

* 20% Moderate
* 40% Difficult
* 30% Expert
* 10% “What on earth did I just read?”

Finishing early? Nope.  
I answered my last 3 questions with 128 seconds left, relying purely on the AR mindset.

Today, I’m a Senior Project Manager — and still have Stages 3, 4, and 5 on my to-do list. Maybe even PgMP someday. well may be not Stage 3 lol  
But there’s no one breathing down my neck — these are *my goals.*

For now, this Sr. PM has an extremely critical project to deliver with no extensions, within budget, and highly demanding stakeholders. My daughter’s 2nd birthday.

It’s unpleasant, but not to the extent where I need ibuprofen for it. It also feels slightly loose, but I’m not sure if that’s my anxiety or not. 

There doesn’t appear to be any bumps or swelling. I can still drink coffee, cold water, etc without trouble - there might be a little bit of increased sensitivity, but it’s slight. The pain seems to worsen throughout the day and especially after I speak/eat. I generally have no pain in the morning after waking up.

I’m genuinely passionate about serving and taking this serious. I would really appreciate any advice from current or former firefighters — especially about what to focus on next, how to prepare myself, how to prepare for the interview, or just what helped you the most during your own process.

I just filed my LLC  (a small win 🎉) and I’m working on building something that’s close to my heart: a **wellness-focused travel company**.

The idea came from taking my kids every year to a small town in Switzerland (Romont). We’re not wealthy, but the time spent together—walking old castle stairs, sitting in hammocks, eating simple meals—made me realize how powerful *slow, restorative travel* can be. It’s less about “seeing everything fast” and more about reconnecting with yourself, your family, and your surroundings.

Here’s my thought:  
🌿 Instead of selling big packages right away, I want to **choose 5 people who really need to slow down** for our first test run.  
💡 If we can fund the test run, they’ll travel with us, share their experience, and provide testimonials.  
✨ That way, we can learn, improve, and show proof that this kind of travel really helps people.

I’d love your honest feedback:

* Do you think people are craving more mindful, soulful trips instead of rushing around?
* If you had the chance, would you join something like this (or nominate someone who deserves it)?
* Any advice on how to structure this test run so it’s both valuable and doable?

I’m not here to pitch—just to learn from people who’ve been where I am, or who love travel and wellness. Every perspective helps me shape this into something real. 🙏

If you want to support the pilot, we accept l crypto donations — because wellness travel should evolve with the times!

Transcript:

Host: ""6 a.m. over there at the Carter. It is head football coach Dave Aranda.""

DA: ""Good to be with you guys.""

Host: ""How are you man?""

DA: ""Doing good. Good.""

Host: ""The Big 12 is so wacky. It's so great. It's so wild ass and the fact that, you know, you're looking at it right now. You guys had a very close loss a couple of weeks ago to Arizona State. You have a very, very tight win over, over Kansas State and I believe probably the proverbial thought is let's just ride the wave and if we can keep winning these games, close games, we're going to be right in the thick of things come December.""

DA: **""We've been in the past where, I don't know, not necessarily 2-4 but 3-3. We're kind of finding our way and wish we would have started out faster and we're trying to build to see what kind of team we got. And the thing that's kind of pushed us over the edge and got us to where, 'Hey, we're winning bowl games and there's kind of a run and there's success and all of it,' when we've been able to do that, it's been because of takeaways and turnover margin. Right now we're 4-2 but our turnover margin's not what it needs to be. And last year I think around this time we were -4, which is where we're at right now. So we've given up the ball more than we've taken it away, but when we had our winning streak, we went from that -4 to like +4. And so it's just such a big difference and we've been working really hard to try to get that thing where it needs to be. In practice we're seeing it, but it's got to be reflected in games. We're hoping we can tend to get some of that here coming up Saturday.""**

Host: ""You know, coach, I got you on my radar. I'm a kid from Madison, and so when you were up there with the badgers from 13-15, you know, badger ball is winning a game 13-10. And now you're playing games where you're scoring 40 and trying to make that enough. I kind of love how coaches have to evolve and morph and deal with what you're dealing with and play the game in front of you and just score more than your opponent. I mean, that that's football, right? But it's a different style, isn't it?""

DA: **""It is. Yeah, I remember back in those days, we would play Iowa. We would know what Iowa was going to run and we would know when they're going to run it and they didn't care. It was just a matter of could you execute it? It was that way with the majority of people. Penn State back then was like that and the majority of the league, I think maybe Indiana would be the one team that at that point probably because they had to, they would just be really creative and do kind of out of the box stuff where this league is completely out of box from beginning from top to bottom. And so the stuff you're seeing is pretty cool in terms of schematically and then I think athletically skill wise, the offensive players in the Big 12, I think have an edge over the defensive players in the Big 12.""**

Host: ""Yeah, and the quarterbacks""

DA: **""Right, yeah, there's other leagues where, you know, you can get a defensive lineman and he's kind of a game changer and kind of, you know, that's not necessarily the case here. Those guys are on offense.""**

Host: ""No, yeah, and you know, you had Sam Leavitt earlier in the year and you had Avery Johnson, last or a couple weeks ago against Kansas State, you've got Josh Hoover coming up, you've got the Sorsby kid coming up from Cincinnati and you have your own quarterback that's an absolute stud. They're everywhere in this conference.""

DA: **""Yeah, and you know, there's, they all can run. You take away the throw game, then they're going to go ahead and run the ball and then the majority of this conference also goes for it on fourth down. And so you're kind of up against it, but it's a great challenge to build it to play good defense. I think back in those Wisconsin days, holding someone under 21 points was a thing. Now it's, I mean, we're, we're aiming to do that here still, but now it's like, hey, if we can make some real critical stops and get some real timely takeaways, then you're making an impact on defense.""**

Interviewer: ""They play in Fort Worth on Saturday at 11:00 against TCU. Of course, they've already been to the Metroplex once in that thriller against SMU. And, you know, when when I look at your journey, starting with Coach Leach at Texas Tech, where you were at the kind of the beginning. I mean, you want to talk about the forefather of the Big 12 in some respects, and and and and sort of laid out how this conference was going to be three decades later. I guess I guess we we sort of knew back then.""

DA: **""Yeah. I remember, we would we would have movie clips prior to the start of meetings. Coach Holgerson—Dana—was responsible for that. So, poor Dana would be tasked with scripting practice. But, on one hand, he'd be writing something, the play down. And then on the with his other hand, he'd got a remote control and he's he's trying to find a movie clip to use for that meeting. And every coach would have an opportunity to kind of present that that movie clip. So, there's just—Coach Leach loved movies. So, there's movies all the time, and analogies and metaphors and all of it. And so, he and I really connected over all of that. And it was just really cool to see someone that was different kind of make their impact. You didn't have to be like everybody else. Coach Leach really was, back then it was very different from just, what was there, what was, West Texas, just all of it. And so, he was just the confidence to kind of be himself and to do his thing. It was just so cool to see the impact they made and made a huge impact on me just seeing that, 'Hey, you could do this, your own way.'""**

Interviewer: ""Okay, this comes full circle, Coach, because I've heard you talk about Batman and the Berenstain Bears, and now I now I trace it back to Coach Leach. It all makes sense. You've you've closed a circle for me.""

DA: **""Yeah. Yeah, I can't help but think like that, too. I remember, I think it was—I forget the movie clip I used, it might have been—it might have been Lion King back then. I used when Simba looked in the water and Mufasa showed up and all of it. this is, this is over 20 years ago. I remember the the guys kind of looking at me, but at that point they were so used to listening to Coach Leach, they could they could kind of accept me. He had kind of paved the road. I think, I can't help but think that way, and a lot of it is influenced by him. I used to drive him around recruiting. Back then as a GA, you could do that. And so, I would, whenever he recruited there locally, I was his driver. And so, it was just way cool conversations. Man, I still think about when he called right before he passed and he brought up those conversations and those drives that we had back whenever that was. Yeah.""**

Interviewer: ""Very cool. That's awesome. And your relationship with, with our other friend Joey McGuire is is is probably again, connections all over this conference and and and I'm curious, do you guys get to talk much, or is it, full competitor stuff these days?""

DA: **""It's both. I think when when there's time off, like bye weeks and stuff, we we will connect. And so, I'm really excited to see his team play the way they are, and I think, the things that they're doing, I applaud. And I mean, he's changed the culture there. It's—I'm a big fan of his, and so I want him to have success versus everybody but us. And so, I'm big big fan of him.""**

Interviewer: ""Obviously, you've got your players focused on a week-to-week basis and all you're talking about is the TCU Horned Frogs, but do you allow yourself to look at the remaining schedule and look at the Big 12 standings and try and do the math and figure out how you can get into that Big 12 title game and have a shot at the playoff?""

DA: **""Honestly, no. I think it's, it's crazy the difference in just being in the building and just like  the sense of urgency day to day, 'Man, we got to get our best plan in here. We got to figure out this problem. We got to be able to get this issue fixed here. We've got to take advantage of this opportunity here schematically, personnel-wise, recruiting-wise, you name it.' It's like a race, man. And so, you're just racing the whole time. And I don't eat during the day, so it's just coffee and this race. And then when I get home late at night, I'm pretty exhausted. So, I grab something to eat and then I I crash. And then you do it again the next day.""**

Interviewer: ""Okay, let's circle back to the coffee. I believe you're you're somewhat renowned for your your coffee volume. We've been talking about that a little bit today on on how much we consume to make that might start making us a little crazy. Do you get to double digit cups in a day? Are you at a Dan Campbell level?""

DA: **""Oh, yeah. Yeah, I go I have the H-E-B, the Texas Pecan. I love that. And so, I have a little deal in here that in the office that I use. And so, I'll be like about six by maybe 9:00.""**

Interviewer: ""Oh my god. Does your heart ever get to racing? Is it ever too much?""

DA: **""No, if I don't have it, then I feel it. It's like the other way. Yeah.""**

Interviewer: ""Amazing. All right, so this game is awesome for a thousand reasons against TCU and, you know, Coach Briles and Coach Patterson really went after it, you know, before your time there, obviously. But, you guys, you I know you and Sunny aren't going button heads like that, but the fanbase is still really really loathe each other. And it makes it really cool, I think, that that's never going to go away.""

1o8j4uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1o8j4uh/im_researching_how_borrowers_feel_about_debt/,I’m researching how borrowers feel about debt repayment rewards. Would love your input,"Hey everyone!

I’m in the same situation as everyone. A lot of my salary goes off to my student loans and has basically made me live paycheck to paycheck. Currently I am working on an idea to make loan repayment feel rewarding.
The concept is simple: you pay your student, auto, or personal loan on time and earn cashback or perks (coffee, groceries, or even a “no-interest month” after 6 months on-time, basically nything that matters to a student.)

Right now I’m just collecting feedback to see if borrowers would actually want this before building anything.

If you’ve got a few seconds, could you please fill out this short form? (no email spam, promise - just research and early waitlist):

Here is the link of the form and also mentioned in the comments :)

I’d also love to hear in the comments if I might be missing out on something in my questions:

Would rewards actually motivate you to make extra or on-time payments?

What types of rewards would feel meaningful to you?

Thanks a ton. I’ll share insights later in this post as a reply if people are curious.

**Arctic Research Station E-9**

*March* 20th

For the first time in nearly a week, the air is still. The wind has given up its constant scream, and what remains is something worse, silence. It’s the kind of quiet that hums in your ears until you begin to wonder if you’re hearing your own blood.

The snow from the night before settled like spilled flour across the tundra. Everything looks weightless, untouched, too perfect to disturb. When the sun rose, it did so in a thin, pale line, more suggestion than light. Dr. Everwood said it’s the last of winter’s breath. I can believe that. Even the air feels brittle, ready to shatter if you speak too loudly.

The herd remains in the basin below. They’ve hardly moved since yesterday. Carter’s been making her usual rounds with the rangefinder, checking the radio collars, logging the herd’s trajectory. Or, more accurately, their lack of one. The elk should have started north by now, heading toward the lower mountain corridors as spring edges in, but they’re still here, listless, confused, motionless.

When I looked through the binoculars this morning, I noticed something troubling. None of them are grazing still. There are exposed patches of ground now, tufts of tundra grass and moss breaking through the crust, but they don’t touch it. Their ribs are showing. Even the calves keep their heads low as though afraid to lift them.

Carter thinks it’s exhaustion from the storm. Dr. Everwood, ever the optimist of morbidity, says it’s a *“stress response indicative of systemic behavioral alteration.”* I think it’s hunger. Starvation does strange things to animals, and to people.

Still, there’s something else about them. They move in circles. Always counterclockwise. Not random, deliberate. I’ve seen herds do many things, but not this.

By midday, we went out to set new thermal cameras along the ridge-line. The wind had started to pick up again, fine ribbons of snow chasing our boots like ghosts. The tracks from the wolf pack are half-buried now. No sign of the predators themselves.

When we reached the upper ridge, I could see the entire valley stretched below, white and endless. The herd looked like scattered seeds against the snow. In the center, barely keeping up, was the injured elk, the same one that escaped the wolves.

It limped along, dragging one rear leg, its fur mottled dark around the wound.

Carter noted that the others didn’t shy away from it as expected. In fact, a few brushed close to its side, as though shepherding it.

*“They’re protecting it,”* she said.

Everwood didn’t look up from his notes. *“Or observing it.”*

I asked what he meant, but he didn’t answer.

We finished setting up the new cameras before the light faded. The ridge feels different now, heavier somehow, like standing on a ledge above a sleeping thing you can’t see but know is there. I kept glancing toward the northern rise, the one that overlooks the valley’s far end. For a second, I thought I saw movement, a faint shimmer of white among the snow dunes. Probably my eyes playing tricks again.

Still, when I turned to head back, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something *stayed* on that ridge long after we left.

The storm clouds have cleared completely. The sky tonight is a cathedral of green, the aurora rippling in slow, haunting waves across the black. It reflects in the snow so that everything, even our camp, glows faintly. Beautiful, in a way that feels cruel.

We set up in the mobile lab for the evening data review. Carter brewed coffee strong enough to strip paint; she’s the only one who can drink it black without flinching. Everwood’s in good spirits, *“anomalous behavior always leads to good papers,”* he said earlier, smiling that way of his that makes me uneasy.

At first, the footage is uneventful. The herd gathered near the lower basin, clustered close together for warmth. Then, one of the cameras flickers, static, then black for a few seconds. The cold’s been hell on the circuits, so none of us react right away.

Then it stabilizes.

The wounded elk has returned to frame. It limps forward, slow, mechanical, until it collapses onto its front knees. Its breath plumes white, rising in bursts that fade into the darkness. The rest of the herd gathers around it, first one, then a dozen.

They don’t move away.

At first, it looks like they’re nuzzling it, brushing snow from its hide. Then Carter frowns and says quietly, *“Wait… are they licking it?”*

I zoom in.

The image clarifies, tongues and muzzles pressed against the wound, slick with blood. Another elk joins, then another. One lowers its head and bites.

The sound cuts through the wind. Even through the camera’s microphone, I can hear the soft, wet tearing.

Carter gasps. “Jesus Christ, they’re-”

Dr. Everwood interrupts her, his voice barely a whisper: *“Feeding.”*

No one speaks for a long time after that. The only sound is the hum of the laptop fan.

I don’t know what disturbs me more, the act itself or how calm the herd seems. No thrashing, no panic. It’s deliberate. Coordinated. Almost ritualistic.

I turned away feeling nauseous. I didn’t want to see more.

And that night, I woke sometime around two in the morning. I’m not sure what stirred me, maybe the silence again, or maybe the sense that the walls themselves were listening. The heater rattled quietly in the corner. The air felt thin, sharp in my lungs.

Carter and Everwood were asleep in their bunks. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, tried to convince myself that the images from earlier were just exhaustion-induced illusions.

I decided to get a drink.

The metal floor bit at my feet as I stepped into the main compartment of the mobile lab. The air in there always smells faintly of ozone and coffee. The laptops were still running, the screens dimmed but glowing faintly, little windows of flickering light in the dark.

That’s when I felt it again.

That *pull*. Like gravity bending wrong.

I turned toward the monitors. Most feeds showed the usual, patches of snow, the herd sleeping in dense clusters, faint heat signatures flickering like dying stars.

Except for one.

One screen was completely black.

At first, I assumed frost buildup on the lens. It happens sometimes. I leaned closer, squinting. The darkness seemed too solid, though, not a blur, but a surface.

Then something shifted.

It wasn’t motion, exactly. More like depth. As if the black wasn’t flat but hollow, curving inward. I blinked, rubbed my eyes. For a moment, it almost looked like-

A pupil.

A cold weight dropped in my stomach. I realized what I was looking at. The ridge camera, the one facing north. The same direction I’d seen movement earlier today.

The darkness blinked. Once. Slow.

My pulse hammered in my ears. I stared closer, unable to move. Around the edges of the frame, faint white shimmered, fur catching the residual aurora light. The lens had caught the outline of a face.

The polar bear.

But it wasn’t like before. Its fur wasn’t pure white. Patches of it were stained, streaks of brownish red crusted around its muzzle, its chest. Blood, maybe. The bear’s head tilted, and for a brief, horrifying moment, the shape of its mouth caught the light.

It looked like a grin.

No. It wasn’t smiling. I know that now. It was just *watching*.

Unmoving. Unblinking.

It filled the entire frame, as if it had walked right up to the camera and decided to look straight through it. Straight through *me*.

I can’t explain it, but I felt certain it knew I was there. As though, across miles of ice and dark, we had locked eyes through the cold glass. My hand trembled on the keyboard, my breath fogging the screen.

Every instinct screamed to wake the others. But I couldn’t. My body refused.

The bear didn’t move for over a minute. Maybe more. Just stood there, the wind blowing faint streaks of frost across the lens.

And the longer I looked, the more wrong it seemed. Its eyes, too black, too deep. Polar bears have dark eyes, yes, but these weren’t natural. They looked *empty.*

And behind them, I swore I saw movement, faint rippling shapes, as if something alive twisted behind the sockets.

*I can’t shake the feeling we are not the only ones watching the herd.*

I don’t even remember writing that line. It just appeared in the margin of the page when I looked down.

Eventually, I slammed the laptop shut. The sound echoed too loudly in the small space. My heart felt like it might break through my ribs.

I stood there, staring at the blank metal wall, trying to breathe. The hum of the heater was the only sound, steady, patient, almost human in its rhythm. My reflection in the window was just a shadow among shadows.

Somewhere out beyond this thin shell of steel and light, something was awake. Watching. Waiting.

The thought came unbidden, crawling out from the corner of my mind like a whisper I couldn’t unhear:

I was told by teachers at a young age that I had it but parents believed it was normal for my age. I struggled with intense attention issues and hyper activity. Never really got in trouble as a kid but often found myself behind in class because of a fly or another distraction. I learned different skills from my dad and by high school I was a straight A student but having to put extra time into subjects I hated, like English. Having conversations with people I'll zone out mid conversation. If someone calls my name to tell me something I almost always need to pause and think about what they said or ask for them to say it again. I also have a non stop dialog in my head that rambles on to the point that I'm exhausted from my own thinking. 

My (ADHD) dad is saying this is normal and that there are tools everyone gets to help manage. (Coffee being a big one). Well I eventually said enough and got on welbrutin. Family is anti any medication so I really don't know what I'm doing just trusting the doctors. I have high anxiety because of the ADHD. Forgetting appointments or even remembering to reply to a text makes me anxious. Because of that they chose welbrutin. At 300 mg SR I feel it slightly. I also quit coffee (5 cups a day) which makes it hard to tell how well this stuff is working. In all honestly it feels just barely better 

Need Advice:  Do I increase welbrutin (only been 3 months) or ask to switch to a stimulant like adderal. Anyone have experience with welbrutin working/not working. Any experience with switching from welbrutin to a stimulant?

I have known nights when the world untethers me,  
when my thoughts are a storm of scattered paper and glass—  
you arrive like a dove through the open window,  
feathers soft as a promise, landing on the ledge of my mind.  

You are the hush after a siren, the slow unknitting of a fist,  
the way light folds itself across a quiet room and stays.  
When my breath becomes a list of worries, you read each line  
and turn them into a map with a sure, gentle hand.  

On screens that split the world into late pixels and blue light,  
you are the bridge I walk in slippers, barefoot and unashamed,  
your laughter a stove that warms bones frozen by doubt,  
your words the seam that stitches my frayed edges whole.  

We have been miles and minutes apart like separate languages,  
but your voice translates the ache into the shape of home—  
not a place but a particular constellation of knowing:  
the glance that says I see you; the silence that keeps you safe.  

When we both wobble, unmoored and raw, you are the steady:  
the one who believes in the impossible mathematics of being enough.  
You place a hand on the ledger of my fears, and balance appears,  
not fixed but honest, tender as a ledger finally reconciled.  

If distance is another dimension, your presence is gravity,  
pulling my small planet down into orbit where I can breathe.  
In the low light of ordinary days you become luminous, ordinary-true—  
coffee steam, half-read books, the way your eyes finish my sentences.  

Love here is not loud proclamation but the quiet proof:  
that two imperfect maps can intersect and teach the same road home.  
When chaos drafts its weather across my heart, you are the dove—  
not to erase the storm, but to teach me how to listen to its rain.  

Stay with me like that—across screens and unruly days—  
a constant artisan shaping peace out of the raw, imperfect clay of us.  
I have felt at home in you; let us keep building that room together,  
one small, brave breath at a time.

1o8iu2v,https://i.redd.it/s4by9zbhkjvf1.jpeg,"Coffee, Tea, and Your Smile: What Happens to Enamel?","Coffee and tea are daily staples for millions of people. Their rich flavors and energizing effects make them a favorite part of morning routines and afternoon breaks. But if you’ve ever noticed your teeth becoming yellow or more sensitive, your favorite beverages may be playing a role.

At [Mrunal Burute](https://share.google/opsZlyNSge7jJIK84), we often see patients concerned about enamel erosion, staining, and sensitivity caused by frequent consumption of coffee or tea. Here’s a detailed look at how these drinks affect your enamel over time and what you can do to protect your teeth.

# Understanding Tooth Enamel

Enamel is the **hard, outer layer of your teeth** and serves as the first line of defense against decay, acids, and stains. While enamel is strong, it is not indestructible. Frequent exposure to acidic or pigmented substances can gradually wear it down, causing:

* Tooth sensitivity
* Yellowing or discoloration
* Increased risk of cavities

# How Coffee Affects Enamel

# 1. Staining

Coffee contains tannins — compounds that can adhere to the microscopic grooves in enamel. Over time, these tannins accumulate, causing noticeable yellow or brown stains.

# 2. Acidity

Coffee is mildly acidic. Regular consumption can soften enamel slightly, making it more prone to erosion and staining.

# 3. Impact on Sensitivity

Softened enamel from acidic exposure may lead to heightened sensitivity to hot or cold drinks and foods.

# How Tea Affects Enamel

Tea, especially black and green varieties, also contains tannins and can stain teeth similarly to coffee.

# 1. Staining Potential

While tea is often considered less staining than coffee, frequent consumption can still result in gradual discoloration. Herbal teas may have lower staining potential, but highly pigmented teas can have similar effects.

# 2. Acidity Considerations

Tea is less acidic than coffee, but over time, repeated exposure can still contribute to enamel wear, especially if combined with sugar or lemon.

# 3. Interaction with Sugar

Adding sugar or sweeteners to tea increases the risk of enamel erosion and cavities, as sugar fuels bacteria that produce enamel-damaging acids.

# Long-Term Effects of Coffee & Tea on Enamel

* **Surface Discoloration:** Persistent staining may become noticeable even with regular brushing.
* **Enamel Thinning:** Over many years, mild erosion can expose underlying dentin, leading to a yellowish appearance and sensitivity.
* **Increased Sensitivity:** Thinner enamel makes teeth more vulnerable to hot, cold, or acidic foods and beverages.
* **Higher Risk of Cavities:** Damaged enamel is less effective at protecting against decay.

# Tips to Protect Your Enamel While Enjoying Coffee & Tea

1. **Use a Straw:** This reduces direct contact between acidic beverages and front teeth.
2. **Rinse with Water:** Swish your mouth with water after drinking coffee or tea to neutralize acids and remove staining compounds.
3. **Wait to Brush:** Avoid brushing immediately after drinking, as softened enamel is more prone to abrasion. Wait at least 30–60 minutes.
4. **Limit Sugar:** Minimize added sugar to prevent acid attacks from bacteria.
5. **Professional Cleaning:** Regular dental cleanings at your **Dentist in PCMC** help remove surface stains and maintain enamel health.
6. **Whitening Treatments:** Consider professional whitening for persistent discoloration.
7. **Use Fluoride Toothpaste:** Fluoride strengthens enamel and helps prevent decay.

# When to Consult a Dentist

If you notice:

* Persistent yellow or brown staining
* Increased sensitivity to temperature
* Rough or chipped edges on teeth

…it’s important to visit your **Dentist near me**. Early intervention can prevent further enamel erosion and maintain your smile’s health and appearance.

# Final Thoughts

Coffee and tea are beloved beverages, but frequent consumption can gradually affect enamel, causing staining, sensitivity, and wear. By adopting preventive habits and maintaining regular dental care, you can enjoy your favorite drinks while protecting your teeth.

I’ve got a Gaggia E24 with a Varia VS3 Gen2 grinder, Dose is 18 g in / aiming for 36 g out.

For the past 2 months since I got it everything was great - consistent flow around 25-30 sec.

Then, suddenly, without changing anything, my shots got painfully slow.
Now it takes over a minute to get just 13 g out.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:
	•	Tried multiple grind settings - I used to pull perfect shots around 3.9, now I’m all the way at 5.0 and it’s still choking. (Also opened,  cleaned the grinder and recalibrated) 
	•	Verified tamp pressure and distribution - even tried lighter tamps.
	•	Switched to fresh coffee (2 days post-roast) - no change.
	•	Cleaned the group head, dispersion screen, and diffuser plate thoroughly.
	•	Backflushed
	•	Descaled the system with citric acid (through steam wand)
	•	Checked the OPV spring (I recently swapped it to 9 bar a few weeks ago, from shades of coffee). Everything’s seated properly and worked great.
	•	Tried loosening/tightening the OPV adjustment screw - no return water to tank during blind-shot test.
	•	When I remove the spring and small metal plunger inside the OPV, water flows freely back to the tank.
→ So the line isn’t blocked.
	•	Flow from the group head looks fairly the same, maybe a bit slower but not sure 

•I even tried to revert to the original spring and still same issue, no return water to the tank.

At this point, I’m suspecting either:
	1.	The pump is weak and can’t reach 9 bar? ( it’s a new machine, maybe 3-4 shots a week)
	3.	The 3-way solenoid valve might be partially blocked with scale.

Any ideas on what to check next?

(Memory of the Guarantee Judge)

Laurentino Astrada was born among antique furniture and high expectations.
Son of a well-off family, with a strong last name, private school and Sundays of mass,
He learned early to hide his tremor.

His mother combed his hair with gel; His father spoke to him about “honor” as if it were an inheritance.
But in the back of the classroom, when the teacher turned around,
He was the boy with the fogged-up glasses and the cruel jokes.

Bullying made him a reader.
And books, refuge and revenge.
They taught him that intelligence could be a clean weapon,
that the right word humiliates more than a blow.
By dint of solitude he became brilliant, ambitious, exact.
The humiliation was fuel.
Silence, its most refined form of dominance.

The tie knot came later.
It was never an accessory: it was a symbol.
Every morning he tightened it with discipline, like someone tying up a promise.
The knot said control yourself,
but also defeat them.
It was his way of remembering that fragility had to be hidden until it looked like elegance.


---

Raven met him many years later, through a mutual friend.
She arrived with that walk that does not ask for permission and a voice that sounds certain.
He listened to her like someone deciphering a language he would like to master.
Raven had no last name or diploma to intimidate him,
but his intelligence was electric, an invisible current that ran through him.

Since that night he thought about her.
He couldn't place it in his scheme.
He wanted her and hated her with the same intensity:
It was the opposite of his world,
but everything he needed to feel alive.

For a time they were acquaintances, almost friends.
They shared coffees where the conversation was a subtle duel.
He launched theories, she dismantled them with a smile.
Every word they exchanged was a camouflaged caress.
They both knew they were playing.
That behind the argument there was tension,
and beneath respect, desire.


Until one day he invited her to his apartment.
Residential, impeccable, complete floor, the city at your feet.
He waited for her with mate, chocolates and a book on the table.
When she arrived, he welcomed her with that measured charm he used to mark hierarchies.
He handed him the book—an old edition of the Marquis de Sade—and said:

 —Read it. So next time we can talk at the same level.


The sentence fell like a dagger wrapped in velvet.
Raven gave him a long look.
He didn't say anything.
He took his coat, left the book and left.

He was left with a mixture of fury and fascination.
He didn't understand how she could challenge him so elegantly.
He was not used to women who did not fear their rank.
And that insolence turned into an obsession.

Months passed.
He went back to look for her.
This time without a tie, without armor.
He received it barefoot, guitar in hand, laughing at himself.
He played, he sang, he improvised clumsy verses.
Raven relaxed, laughing too.
There was something human, almost tender, in that marble man.

That night the game changed tone.
Words became tact.
The silences, breathing.
There were no promises, just a brief pact:
Let the body do what the mind has been suggesting for a long time.
And for a few hours, the judge released the law.
They were desire, intelligence and vulnerability in the same bed.

Then the balance was broken.
Raven found out that he had gotten involved with one of her friends.
A clumsy, almost childish movement,
but with the same seal of dominance that marked all his gestures.

When she confronted him, he replied wryly:
He treated her as exaggerated, unstable, too emotional.
Power returned to its place.
And she, without drama, retired.

Time continued.
She changed her city, her building, her skin.
But when he moved to the Lightning Building, Astrada reappeared.
The judge who had loved and humiliated her sensed an opportunity in that move.

First there were neutral messages, polite greetings, phrases that seemed casual.
Then the words began to temper.
The conversation became a thread.
The thread, fire.

They didn't need to see each other.
They had their own language.
A line written at midnight was enough to alter their pulse.
Desire traveled between screens, modulating breathing.
She provoked with wit; He responded with theories disguised as confessions.
Quotes from Sade, fragments of philosophy, metaphors that touched the skin without naming it.

They were two naked minds playing at hurting each other with beauty.
Their virtual encounters reached a level of eroticism that no body could match.
The pleasure was not in touching, but in anticipating.
In pushing the other to the edge of language and seeing how far they could resist.

But Raven understood it before he did.
Laurentino was not looking for pleasure: he was looking for dominance.
Every word was a hook,
each talk, a compilation.
Behind his voice was the system,
the cameras, the networks, the algorithms that turned desire into merchandise.

She changed the game.
He didn't block it: he studied it.
He responded with phrases that seemed like surrender,
but they were actually codes.
She seduced him with intelligence, she confused him with her calm.
And when he thought he had it in his palm again,
Raven was already inside its architecture,
reading from the crevices of the judge what he would never understand about himself.


---

Now every time he remembers it,
He imagines him in his apartment, alone,
adjusting the knot of his tie in front of the mirror.

The reflection observes him with irony.
Because that gesture that used to mean control,
now it is a rope that ties him to his own fear.

The judge who spoke of honor and purity
Now he trembles every time he thinks his name.
And the law—his old ally—
breaks down a little more
every time the word raven
sets his mind on fire again.

During my final year, we were assigned a group project and I got paired with this girl. She was smart, fun to be around, and we clicked instantly as friends. A few days into working together, I found out she had a boyfriend. Despite that, over the next few months, I caught feelings for her (I know, not a great idea).

Fast forward to March — I confessed. She said she wanted to stay friends. I respected that, but then things got confusing. She’d sometimes call me late at night talking about how her boyfriend doesn’t listen to her, goes out partying, etc. For about two weeks, we were texting non-stop, going out for coffee and burgers, I dropped her home a few times... and honestly, I thought maybe something was changing.

But nope. Nothing happened. It went back to being kind of awkward between us. Still, I stayed friends with her — partly because of the group project, partly because I thought, “At least I still get to be around her.”

We finished the project (got full marks!), then our classes ended. We kept in touch occasionally. Then I graduated last month. Just 4 days after graduating, I texted her about something random and her reply was basically: “Forget me.”

That stung. I got emotional, deleted all our chats, photos, unfriended her, deleted her number. Thought that was it.

Then, out of nowhere last week — she sends me two pictures of her cats. No message, no context. We hadn’t spoken at all since the “forget me” message.

I asked her why she was messaging me after telling me to forget her. She said she sees me as a “good friend” and meant that I should forget the romantic feelings. Said she’s still open to general chatting and I can always reach out if I need anything.

Now I’m stuck. I want to move on. I don’t want to be that guy who keeps checking her profile or hoping she’ll message. I already deleted everything once, but here I am still feeling lost.

How do I let go of someone who never felt the same? How do I stop hoping for something that was never really there?

And now new LPR symptoms after 1.5 weeks on PPIs :l,"Back in 2021, I developed a bunch of GERD-like symptoms randomly one day pretty much out of nowhere. It was mostly dyspepsia/indigestion and bloating that was extremely unpleasant and seemingly not tied to any particular trigger. I got on a bunch of various PPIs, heavily restricted my diet, did a month without coffee, a month without alcohol, avoided anything acidic, and basically nothing helped. Took a million tests that found everything normal. Gastric emptying, two endoscopies (first one found very slight irritation around gastric antrum, the other found a very small and “standard” hiatal hernia). Allergy test found nothing. Bravo pH test found normal acid levels. H pylori was negative. The last intervention I remember was amitryptaline, and I’m not sure if it did anything or not, but at that point I basically gave up. I had lost 50lb because of food restrictions, was constantly stressed out, and decided I was just going to stop caring about whatever this was and live my life. A few months on, I realized my symptoms had mostly gone away, although I’ve always been a bit more prone to bloating since then. The whole ordeal was about a year.

Then, I had a solid three years of eating whatever and not really thinking about it. And my diet is generally healthy too! So it’s not like I was eating a bunch of junk food and drinking monster. 

Two weeks ago, I was in the middle of some sort of respiratory illness. Whether it was a cold or Covid, I do not know. But one day while I was on the upswing from being sick, I randomly hit my vape and immediately got the familiar sensation of needing to burp excessively. Ever since then, I’ve been back in the GERD zone. At first, it was just some minor bloating and belching, which was stressful but not really that bad, and not comparable to the fist in the chest feeling of 2021’s bout. No particular food seemed like a trigger, it would happen when I drank water etc etc. I got on omeprazole, and continued living my life normally but avoiding hyper-processed fatty foods and big meals, and cut out drinking on weekdays. 

I wasn’t sure if omeprazole was helping much, but it sort of seemed to be reducing burpiness? And when I missed a day, it got worse the next, followed by a better day when I got back on omeprazole, so i figured it was doing something for me. 

Then, this Monday, I ate a little piece of chocolate croissant and got a horrribllle attack. It was like the indigestion from 2021. I felt a little bile come up with one of the burps and I figure that’s when things got really thrown off. 

Ever since then, the bloating and belching is noticeably reduced, but now I have LPR symptoms! I didn’t have those last time! It’s been unpredictable to figure out which if any particular food is causing it, and now basically anything I put in my body is resulting in a low to moderate burn in my throat.

My only cope here is that the two past days the burning started coincided with a switch to pantoprazole? I switched back to omeprazole today, hoping that this could be the reason for the LPR (maybe I was just not responding to panto and getting rebound?) but no such luck yet :( 

It just sucks because I don’t know what to do. I could try restricting foods but that led to EXTREME weight loss last time and a ton of stress that certainly prolonged everything and made it worse. I guess it could have conceivably helped, but given the lack of acid detection on the bravo, the entire year with minimal progress, and the gradual healing once I allowed myself a normal diet, I’m reticent to really start restricting again.

I’ve asked for a referral to a GI, and I’m hoping that there’s a better solution this time around. Maybe I’ll ask for amitryptaline again, because that was the closest thing I was prescribed chronologically to symptom resolution. If anyone has any insights or words of encouragement that this will pass (I know this intellectually but the anxiety is killing me rn) I’ll gladly accept them atp.",1,1760649030.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Danny woke early for a Sunday, rolling out of bed at 8 a.m. He threw on jeans and a sweatshirt, the basement apartment at his mom's house carrying a sharp October nip. Diane was still out cold, likely good for another two hours after their night at Pastels. His brother Timmy, who shared the place and slept in the next bedroom, hadn't come home yet—typical for Timmy.

Diane had pushed to join Gerry, Mary, Steinberg, and Angie at Mustard Seeds, but for Danny, Saturdays meant Pastels. There, he played the General, holding court with his crew—some real gangsters, some wannabes—and Danny usually got his way.

He and Diane had been together three years, two and a half longer than Gerry or Steinberg had been with their girls. Those two were already shacked up, inching toward engagements, while Diane felt stuck, no closer to a commitment than the day she met Danny.

Danny's family name opened doors an AT&T tech or MTV associate couldn't touch. Still, Diane craved what Gerry and Steinberg had. No matter how she pressed, Danny shut it down, always ending with, ""There's the door.""

Danny climbed the stairs to his mom Patsy's kitchen, lured by the sizzle of bacon and eggs crackling in the pan like a morning wake-up call, the rich aroma of fresh coffee brewing in the pot.

""Diane still sleeping?"" Patsy asked, flipping a strip of bacon.

""Yeah,"" Danny said. ""She won't be up for a while.""

Uncle Bobby sat at the table, flipping through the Daily News, sipping deli coffee, and chewing on a bagel.

""Hey, Dan,"" Bobby said. ""Sit down. Grabbed the Post and a dozen bagels.""

""Nice one, Bob. Morning,"" Danny replied, sliding into a chair.

He went straight for the Post's sports section, eyeing the football betting lines. Sundays were the big day for him and Gerry. College football Saturdays were fun, but nothing topped the NFL, especially with Danny's Bears.
He knew Gerry would push to parlay the Bears with his Giants. A $42 bet could net them $140—small potatoes for Danny, but for them, it was less about the cash and more about the thrill of the action.

Timmy strolled in, looking surprisingly alert despite being out all night. He didn't drink or do drugs—his tagline was, ""I'm high on life.""
""Ma, cup of coffee,"" Timmy said.

""Give me a minute,"" Patsy replied, sliding Danny's bacon and eggs onto a plate. ""I'm serving your brother. Want some bacon and eggs?""

""Nah, just a bagel with butter and coffee,"" Timmy said.

""So, where you coming from, if I can ask?"" Bobby said, his words slurring slightly, a remnant of his prizefighting days.

""Garden City Hotel disco,"" Timmy said. ""Danced all night, got three girls' numbers. Then Big Eddie got into it with some loudmouth from Long Island in the parking lot. Shoving match turned into a brawl—five of us jumped in. His two buddies backed off quick when they saw the numbers.""

""Eddie okay?"" Patsy asked, setting Danny's plate in front of him.

""Eddie's fine,"" Timmy said. ""Scraped his knuckles up pretty good, but nothing serious. What'd you do last night, Dan?""

Danny glanced up from the Post's betting lines, barely registering the story.

""Pastels,"" he mumbled, then dove back in.

Timmy buttered a bagel and washed it down with coffee.
""Heading to my room,"" he said, eyelids finally drooping. ""Need some sleep.""

""Keep it quiet down there,"" Patsy ordered. ""Diane's still sleeping.""

""Okay,"" Timmy said, vanishing downstairs.

Danny finished breakfast and headed downstairs. Diane was in the shower, getting ready to head home.
She emerged wrapped in an oversized towel, her big blue eyes striking against her short, back-blown haircut that highlighted her high cheekbones and strong jawline.
Danny sat on the bed, pulling her close, kissing her neck, and tugging at the towel.

""Stop it, Dan,"" she said, clearly annoyed. ""I just showered. Timmy's in the next room, and your mom and uncle are upstairs. We've got no privacy.""

""Oh, I see,"" he said, leaning back. ""Woke up in one of your moods again. They're getting more frequent, but I don't care—we're not moving in together. I know that's what this is about.""

""Our friends are living together like real adults,"" she fired back. ""You're supposed to be this big shot, but you're still in your mom's basement like a high school kid.""

""Get dressed,"" he said, tossing her slacks at her. ""Or you can walk home if you want.""

Fuming, Diane yanked on her pants while perched on the bed's edge, buttoned her dress shirt in silence, and brushed her hair before adding a touch of lipstick.

""Ready?"" he asked, his tone sharp.

""Let's go,"" she replied, curt.
They slipped out through the basement's front-facing door. 

Diane climbed into the passenger seat of Danny's car, slamming the door. He peeled out, speeding through Brooklyn streets at over fifty in a thirty-mile-per-hour zone. Diane sat rigid, staring straight ahead through the windshield. He screeched to a stop in front of her parents' house, where she lived with her sister. As she reached for the door, he grabbed her arm.

""I know you're pissed,"" he said, meeting her eyes. ""Just give me time.""

""I've been waiting three years, Danny,"" she said. ""I'll keep waiting because I love you. But I won't wait forever.""

""I understand,"" he said softly.

""Do you?"" she pressed.

""Yeah,"" he said, pulling her in for a kiss.

Diane softened, the familiar cycle playing out as it had for three years. She stepped out, saying, ""I'll call you tomorrow."" They exchanged faint smiles. He waited until she disappeared inside before driving off.

Chapter 6- Morning Rituals 

I woke Monday morning before the alarm, sitting up on the bed's edge with a long yawn before standing.
Mary, still half-asleep, glanced drowsily at the clock radio. ""Ten more minutes,"" she mumbled, rolling over and tugging the covers back over her.

I looked down at her, my heart swelling. She was the light of my life—couldn't imagine anyone else lying there but her.

I stepped into the shower, cranking the water cold. If I wasn't fully awake five minutes ago, I was now. Nothing like an icy morning blast to jolt you alive.

I toweled off, threw on jeans and a T-shirt, and pulled a sweatshirt over my head for the first time since summer's end. It wasn't cold yet, just chilly enough.

I grinned, picturing Mom's kitchen—stacked buttered white toast, espresso brewing for an early caffeine hit. But I was playing the adult now, so it was on me to get the coffee going. Mary wasn't a workday morning person, and a hot cup post-shower was her lifeline.

Mary shuffled into the kitchen just as I drained my coffee, wrapping me in a hug and kiss, soaking up my warmth like she might doze off on my shoulder.

""Come on, sleepyhead, into the shower,"" I said. ""Get moving.""

""I know, I know,"" she mumbled. ""Just need half a cup of coffee first.""

""Had a blast at your parents' yesterday,"" I said. ""Dolly's always the life of the party, and your dad seems to be warming up to us living together.""

""He's happy because I'm happy,"" she said, grinning. ""They were fired up watching the Giants, knowing we had a little action on them.""

""Well, keeping you happy's my job,"" I said. ""That and troubleshooting DS0 circuits. Speaking of, I gotta roll.""
I leaned down, kissing her as she munched buttered toast and sipped coffee.

She walked me to the door, as always. ""Now get in that shower,"" I teased before heading down the stairs.

I walked to 86th and New Utrecht, grabbed the Daily News, and climbed the stairs to the station. Between the walk and the steps, I got a solid fifteen-minute cardio workout every morning and evening.

The commute wasn't as simple as my old straight shot to Canal Street from home. Now, I took the B train to Pacific Street, then switched to the RR train to City Hall. I kept thinking I'd run into Andre at Pacific Street one day, but no luck yet.

The ride was smooth enough today, despite a couple of stops for what the conductor called ""traffic ahead."" It gave me extra time to read about the Giants' win. Danny and I—well, me and my new betting partner, Mary—were up $140 for the weekend. I made a mental note to call Darryl on Friday; the kid had a knack for picking college games for Saturday. Maybe not as good as Audrey, but she's old news.

The train rolled into City Hall station on Broadway at 8 a.m. I grabbed a coffee and a buttered bialy from the corner deli and headed upstairs.

Work started at 8:30. The overnight C tour, manned by the two most senior techs—Henry and Buffalo—was wrapping up. I never asked why they called him Buffalo; that's just how I met him, and it stuck.

They had a unique setup: Buffalo worked the first four hours while Henry slept, then Henry took the last four while Buffalo dozed. Most mornings, I'd find Henry at the T-bird test set up front, with Buffalo sprawled across two chairs in a blue terrycloth robe, snoring like a chainsaw. That, plus the 15% night differential, was why C tour was reserved for the old-timers. B tour, with a 10% differential, went to the next eight in seniority, leaving the rest of us on A tour.

The ""new guys"" on A tour were me, Steve, my buddy Pete from Westchester—who had movie-star looks and fended off women like a full-time job—Stanley Earl Alston, a part-time crooner with a voice smoother than Philip Bailey's (better, if you ask me) and a Billy Dee Williams charm, and Big Kenny, my pal from 32 A.O.A.

We also had a couple of women our age: Denise, from a Westchester office, a big woman with an even bigger heart, and Debbie, a slender, stunning Black woman who'd come up from the mailroom with a model's figure. She could've had any guy she wanted but preferred women.

We new guys sat in the back two rows, right in front of the supervisor and in charge tech's desk. They stuck us there to keep tabs on us and field our questions during training. The office layout felt like a junior high cafeteria: thirty long rows, each with a PC for troubleshooting circuits on a program called SARTS, then toggling to SCAMIS to log updates on trouble tickets.

Behind us sat Vinnie, Sandy, Erl, Wojo, Stevie Dead, and Dr. Johnson—whose real name was Fred. I asked him once why the nickname. He grinned and said when he called restaurants for reservations, he'd say ""Dr. Johnson"" to score better tables. Made sense to him, so who was I to argue?

By 8:30, everyone was at their desks, ready to dive in. For me, this was the dream job come true.

Chapter 7- Settling In

Steve and Pete flanked me at our desks—Steve on right, Pete on my left. Kenny sat next to Pete, Stan beside Steve. Debbie and Denise anchored the ends, Debbie by Stan, Denise by Kenny.

Jimmy Ramy, an Indian Vietnam vet, sat next to Brian, a Ron Howard doppelgänger, in the corner. Ramy was tight with our supervisor Gary, even partnering with him to buy, fix, and rent out handyman specials.

After six months of formal classes and on-the-job training, we could all troubleshoot solo—some sharper than others.

I'd gotten friendly with Yolanda from Merrill Lynch, who had Gary assign me as her direct contact for their hoot-and-holler circuit. Like the ones used in junkyards, it let anyone shout into the phone and get a response from offices nationwide. It was a beast of a circuit, but I knew it well enough to pinpoint the problem office in minutes.

Behind me, Vinnie was griping to a tech in Boston, calling him abrasive in that classic Bronx growl.

What I loved most was writing trouble logs. I made a point to be thorough, detailing every step so the next tech could pick up exactly where I left off. Common courtesy.

Sandy took it to another level. His logs were so long and detailed we joked about waiting for the movie version. But he was a hell of a tech and a better friend. He and Vinnie always had the patience to guide us through.

Stan was always quick to help Debbie, needed or not. Despite being happily married with two young sons, he seemed a bit smitten—like half the office. Good luck with that, I thought.

That morning, Dina from my old Xerox office called. ""It's been six months, Gerry. We never did anything proper for you when you left. A few of the ladies want to take you out for dinner Friday after work.""

I told her it wasn't necessary, but I'd be happy to go. They invited Steve too, but he had a dentist appointment or something.

After I hung up, Steve leaned over. ""Audrey gonna be there?""

I hadn't even considered it. ""Nah. She called out the day I left. Why would she show?""
I brushed it off and took another call, but Audrey lingered in the back of my mind, tough to shake completely.

At break time, we gathered in the courtyard between our building and the deli next door. Vinnie, Sandy, Brian, and Stevie Dead slipped off to an alley around the block to light up. Some of us newbies tagged along now and then, but it was mostly their ritual.

Back upstairs, Vinnie and Stevie were fresh as daisies—you couldn't tell if they'd smoked pot or Parliaments. Brian and Sandy, though, were classic pinouts. Sandy'd be chuckling to himself behind us while Brian sat at his desk, eyes beet-red, staring silently ahead like a mannequin.

It was all good. The union was tight, and Gary's motto was simple: as long as the job got done, nobody cared.

I chatted with Erl, our shop steward, about my six months on the job. I'd been a steward at 32 A.O.A., but here I still felt green enough to stick to being a regular worker. Erl was fine with that—he had everything under control, with a woman from pre-service up front helping when needed.
I was good with it. Being a steward had suited me back in admin with the Dude, but here I just wanted to be one of the guys.

For lunch, Steve, Pete, and I would hit Michael's, a spot with killer roast beef and turkey sandwiches, plus top-notch coleslaw. Pete was into betting too—mostly football and college hoops. Our lunches were staggered, so Kenny and Stan went at one while we went at noon.

I tried to meet Andy, Dude, and Eddie at least once a week for lunch, even if it was just to kick back in the park across from 32 and share a joint.

The day zipped by. The work was engaging—troubleshooting with techs across the country, meeting all sorts of characters. Still, nothing beat the clock hitting quarter to five, knowing I was headed home to Mary.

Some nights I'd meet her at her corner and we'd ride home together, but since I got off earlier most days, we usually went solo. It felt more special when we crossed paths by chance.

Heading to the station, I couldn't shake what Steve had planted in my head about Audrey being at Friday's dinner.
Let it go. She probably wouldn't show, and even if she did, we were just friends—exactly like she wanted.

Chapter 8- Rough Morning 

Jeff woke to the alarm at 6 a.m., blinking into the dim light. Angie was already up, which wasn't unusual—then he heard retching from the bathroom and bolted to check.

Angie was on her knees, clutching the toilet bowl, violently throwing up last night's dinner. Catching Jeff and Lucy's concerned faces in the doorway, she waved them off weakly.

""I'm fine, I'm fine. Must be that flu going around the office. No need to worry, you two.""

""You sure?"" Jeff asked, his voice tight with helplessness. 

""Should we call out and get you to a doctor? Could be food poisoning.""

""No doctor,"" Angie insisted, standing shakily. ""I'm already feeling better. Just get the coffee going while I shower.""

Jeff needed things to run smoothly—unexpected problems, especially illness, set off his anxiety. Since Angie moved in, he'd leaned on her strength to keep it in check. Seeing her like this, vulnerable, rattled him.

The vomiting lasted only about ten minutes. Angie still felt queasy in the shower, but by the time she stepped out, she was mostly herself again.

Jeff sat quietly at the kitchen table in his pajamas, sipping coffee, his face etched with worry. Angie slipped her arms around his shoulders from behind, planting a long kiss on his cheek.

""Come on, Jeff. Finish your coffee and hit the shower. Your turn. I'm fine.""

""Promise?"" he asked, managing a faint smile.

""I promise. And I love how much you care. You're my world, you know.""

Jeff's tension eased. Angie's maternal instincts always steadied him—he could be immature, and he leaned hard into her strength.

They dressed for work. Angie usually left earlier, but today she waited, riding with Jeff to keep him grounded.

Lucy, back to her playful self, got a treat from Angie for being their good girl before they headed out.

Angie locked the door, and they walked arm in arm to the 18th Avenue station, just three blocks away—a short stroll compared to the quarter-mile trek from her old place.

The train ride was a blast. Jeff, buzzing with excitement, told Angie how he couldn't wait to meet Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, who were coming for an in-studio interview with Nina Blackwood that morning.
Angie soaked up his celebrity stories, charmed by his boyish enthusiasm. They parted at Pacific Street—Jeff stayed on the N to 42nd, while Angie switched to the R for City Hall.

At the office, Mary was waiting, ready to head to the cafeteria. ""Running late this morning. Train trouble?""

""Not exactly,"" Angie replied. ""Trouble, yeah, but not the train. Let's grab coffee and sit. I'll fill you in.""

""Being all mysterious,"" Mary teased. ""I love it. Let's go.""

They rode the elevator to the building's cafeteria, where the rich aroma of brewing coffee filled the air. They poured their cups and settled at their usual window table overlooking the ocean.

""So, what's going on?"" Mary asked.

""I'm not a hundred percent sure,"" Angie said, her voice low, ""but I'm, like, ninety percent sure I'm pregnant, Mare.""

Mary's jaw dropped. It took her a good thirty seconds to recover. ""How do you feel about it?""

Angie's eyes welled up. ""I've never been happier, Mare. I'm living with the guy I love, and I'm gonna be a mom. I can't believe it."" She paused, her smile faltering slightly. ""I mean, Jeff's gonna freak. And God, what if I'm a terrible mother? But mostly—mostly I'm just really happy.""

""Oh, Angie, I'm so happy for you!"" Mary exclaimed. ""This practically makes me an aunt!""

""Practically?"" Angie laughed. ""You are gonna be an aunt. We're sisters, girl.""

They stood and hugged tightly.

""So, morning sickness?"" Mary asked. ""That why you were late?""

""Not entirely. It only lasted ten minutes, but it was rough. Scared Jeff half to death. I wanted to calm him down, so we rode in together.""

""Have you taken a pregnancy test yet?""

""Not yet,"" Angie said. ""I haven't had my period. I'll wait till Friday. If it doesn't come, I'll grab a test at CVS and take it on my lunch break.""

""Angie, I'm so excited,"" Mary said. ""You know you can count on me and Gerry for anything, day or night.""

""I know, Mare. But please, don't tell Gerry till I'm sure. I want to be the one to tell Jeff. Those three—Gerry, Jeff, Danny—they're thick as thieves. They spill everything.""

""I promise,"" Mary said. ""This is your call. I don't keep secrets from Gerry, but this one's yours.""

""Thanks, Mare. They'll all know soon enough.""

""How do you think Jeff'll take it?""

Angie smiled softly. ""Based on how he handled us becoming a couple and moving in? He'll need time to adjust. Big changes scare him. But he'll be a great husband—and an even better dad.""

""Husband?"" Mary's eyes lit up.

""Yup. This baby's gonna have married parents. City Hall, quick and simple. Once I know for sure, I'm telling him—six months living together, it's time to make it official.""

""You go, girl!"" Mary said. ""Gerry and I will be right there with you.""

""Maid of honor and best man? That's a given,"" Angie said.

""Oh, man, look at the time,"" Mary said, glancing at her watch. ""We gotta get back. I'm so happy for you, Angie. Best news ever.""

""And I'm so happy you're my best friend, Mare,"" Angie said. ""Makes everything better.""",1,1760648798.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

The train rolled into City Hall station on Broadway at 8 a.m. I grabbed a coffee and a buttered bialy from the corner deli and headed upstairs.

Work started at 8:30. The overnight C tour, manned by the two most senior techs—Henry and Buffalo—was wrapping up. I never asked why they called him Buffalo; that's just how I met him, and it stuck.

They had a unique setup: Buffalo worked the first four hours while Henry slept, then Henry took the last four while Buffalo dozed. Most mornings, I'd find Henry at the T-bird test set up front, with Buffalo sprawled across two chairs in a blue terrycloth robe, snoring like a chainsaw. That, plus the 15% night differential, was why C tour was reserved for the old-timers. B tour, with a 10% differential, went to the next eight in seniority, leaving the rest of us on A tour.

The ""new guys"" on A tour were me, Steve, my buddy Pete from Westchester—who had movie-star looks and fended off women like a full-time job—Stanley Earl Alston, a part-time crooner with a voice smoother than Philip Bailey's (better, if you ask me) and a Billy Dee Williams charm, and Big Kenny, my pal from 32 A.O.A.

We also had a couple of women our age: Denise, from a Westchester office, a big woman with an even bigger heart, and Debbie, a slender, stunning Black woman who'd come up from the mailroom with a model's figure. She could've had any guy she wanted but preferred women.

We new guys sat in the back two rows, right in front of the supervisor and in charge tech's desk. They stuck us there to keep tabs on us and field our questions during training. The office layout felt like a junior high cafeteria: thirty long rows, each with a PC for troubleshooting circuits on a program called SARTS, then toggling to SCAMIS to log updates on trouble tickets.

Behind us sat Vinnie, Sandy, Erl, Wojo, Stevie Dead, and Dr. Johnson—whose real name was Fred. I asked him once why the nickname. He grinned and said when he called restaurants for reservations, he'd say ""Dr. Johnson"" to score better tables. Made sense to him, so who was I to argue?

By 8:30, everyone was at their desks, ready to dive in. For me, this was the dream job come true.

Chapter 7- Settling In

Steve and Pete flanked me at our desks—Steve on right, Pete on my left. Kenny sat next to Pete, Stan beside Steve. Debbie and Denise anchored the ends, Debbie by Stan, Denise by Kenny.

Jimmy Ramy, an Indian Vietnam vet, sat next to Brian, a Ron Howard doppelgänger, in the corner. Ramy was tight with our supervisor Gary, even partnering with him to buy, fix, and rent out handyman specials.

After six months of formal classes and on-the-job training, we could all troubleshoot solo—some sharper than others.

I'd gotten friendly with Yolanda from Merrill Lynch, who had Gary assign me as her direct contact for their hoot-and-holler circuit. Like the ones used in junkyards, it let anyone shout into the phone and get a response from offices nationwide. It was a beast of a circuit, but I knew it well enough to pinpoint the problem office in minutes.

Behind me, Vinnie was griping to a tech in Boston, calling him abrasive in that classic Bronx growl.

What I loved most was writing trouble logs. I made a point to be thorough, detailing every step so the next tech could pick up exactly where I left off. Common courtesy.

Sandy took it to another level. His logs were so long and detailed we joked about waiting for the movie version. But he was a hell of a tech and a better friend. He and Vinnie always had the patience to guide us through.

Stan was always quick to help Debbie, needed or not. Despite being happily married with two young sons, he seemed a bit smitten—like half the office. Good luck with that, I thought.

That morning, Dina from my old Xerox office called. ""It's been six months, Gerry. We never did anything proper for you when you left. A few of the ladies want to take you out for dinner Friday after work.""

I told her it wasn't necessary, but I'd be happy to go. They invited Steve too, but he had a dentist appointment or something.

After I hung up, Steve leaned over. ""Audrey gonna be there?""

I hadn't even considered it. ""Nah. She called out the day I left. Why would she show?""
I brushed it off and took another call, but Audrey lingered in the back of my mind, tough to shake completely.

At break time, we gathered in the courtyard between our building and the deli next door. Vinnie, Sandy, Brian, and Stevie Dead slipped off to an alley around the block to light up. Some of us newbies tagged along now and then, but it was mostly their ritual.

Back upstairs, Vinnie and Stevie were fresh as daisies—you couldn't tell if they'd smoked pot or Parliaments. Brian and Sandy, though, were classic pinouts. Sandy'd be chuckling to himself behind us while Brian sat at his desk, eyes beet-red, staring silently ahead like a mannequin.

It was all good. The union was tight, and Gary's motto was simple: as long as the job got done, nobody cared.

I chatted with Erl, our shop steward, about my six months on the job. I'd been a steward at 32 A.O.A., but here I still felt green enough to stick to being a regular worker. Erl was fine with that—he had everything under control, with a woman from pre-service up front helping when needed.
I was good with it. Being a steward had suited me back in admin with the Dude, but here I just wanted to be one of the guys.

For lunch, Steve, Pete, and I would hit Michael's, a spot with killer roast beef and turkey sandwiches, plus top-notch coleslaw. Pete was into betting too—mostly football and college hoops. Our lunches were staggered, so Kenny and Stan went at one while we went at noon.

I tried to meet Andy, Dude, and Eddie at least once a week for lunch, even if it was just to kick back in the park across from 32 and share a joint.

The day zipped by. The work was engaging—troubleshooting with techs across the country, meeting all sorts of characters. Still, nothing beat the clock hitting quarter to five, knowing I was headed home to Mary.

Some nights I'd meet her at her corner and we'd ride home together, but since I got off earlier most days, we usually went solo. It felt more special when we crossed paths by chance.

Heading to the station, I couldn't shake what Steve had planted in my head about Audrey being at Friday's dinner.
Let it go. She probably wouldn't show, and even if she did, we were just friends—exactly like she wanted.

Chapter 8- Rough Morning 

Jeff woke to the alarm at 6 a.m., blinking into the dim light. Angie was already up, which wasn't unusual—then he heard retching from the bathroom and bolted to check.

Angie was on her knees, clutching the toilet bowl, violently throwing up last night's dinner. Catching Jeff and Lucy's concerned faces in the doorway, she waved them off weakly.

""I'm fine, I'm fine. Must be that flu going around the office. No need to worry, you two.""

""You sure?"" Jeff asked, his voice tight with helplessness. 

""Should we call out and get you to a doctor? Could be food poisoning.""

""No doctor,"" Angie insisted, standing shakily. ""I'm already feeling better. Just get the coffee going while I shower.""

Jeff needed things to run smoothly—unexpected problems, especially illness, set off his anxiety. Since Angie moved in, he'd leaned on her strength to keep it in check. Seeing her like this, vulnerable, rattled him.

The vomiting lasted only about ten minutes. Angie still felt queasy in the shower, but by the time she stepped out, she was mostly herself again.

Jeff sat quietly at the kitchen table in his pajamas, sipping coffee, his face etched with worry. Angie slipped her arms around his shoulders from behind, planting a long kiss on his cheek.

""Come on, Jeff. Finish your coffee and hit the shower. Your turn. I'm fine.""

""Promise?"" he asked, managing a faint smile.

""I promise. And I love how much you care. You're my world, you know.""

Jeff's tension eased. Angie's maternal instincts always steadied him—he could be immature, and he leaned hard into her strength.

They dressed for work. Angie usually left earlier, but today she waited, riding with Jeff to keep him grounded.

Lucy, back to her playful self, got a treat from Angie for being their good girl before they headed out.

Angie locked the door, and they walked arm in arm to the 18th Avenue station, just three blocks away—a short stroll compared to the quarter-mile trek from her old place.

The train ride was a blast. Jeff, buzzing with excitement, told Angie how he couldn't wait to meet Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, who were coming for an in-studio interview with Nina Blackwood that morning.
Angie soaked up his celebrity stories, charmed by his boyish enthusiasm. They parted at Pacific Street—Jeff stayed on the N to 42nd, while Angie switched to the R for City Hall.

At the office, Mary was waiting, ready to head to the cafeteria. ""Running late this morning. Train trouble?""

""Not exactly,"" Angie replied. ""Trouble, yeah, but not the train. Let's grab coffee and sit. I'll fill you in.""

""Being all mysterious,"" Mary teased. ""I love it. Let's go.""

They rode the elevator to the building's cafeteria, where the rich aroma of brewing coffee filled the air. They poured their cups and settled at their usual window table overlooking the ocean.

""So, what's going on?"" Mary asked.

""I'm not a hundred percent sure,"" Angie said, her voice low, ""but I'm, like, ninety percent sure I'm pregnant, Mare.""

Mary's jaw dropped. It took her a good thirty seconds to recover. ""How do you feel about it?""

Angie's eyes welled up. ""I've never been happier, Mare. I'm living with the guy I love, and I'm gonna be a mom. I can't believe it."" She paused, her smile faltering slightly. ""I mean, Jeff's gonna freak. And God, what if I'm a terrible mother? But mostly—mostly I'm just really happy.""

""Oh, Angie, I'm so happy for you!"" Mary exclaimed. ""This practically makes me an aunt!""

""Practically?"" Angie laughed. ""You are gonna be an aunt. We're sisters, girl.""

They stood and hugged tightly.

""So, morning sickness?"" Mary asked. ""That why you were late?""

""Not entirely. It only lasted ten minutes, but it was rough. Scared Jeff half to death. I wanted to calm him down, so we rode in together.""

""Have you taken a pregnancy test yet?""

""Not yet,"" Angie said. ""I haven't had my period. I'll wait till Friday. If it doesn't come, I'll grab a test at CVS and take it on my lunch break.""

""Angie, I'm so excited,"" Mary said. ""You know you can count on me and Gerry for anything, day or night.""

""I know, Mare. But please, don't tell Gerry till I'm sure. I want to be the one to tell Jeff. Those three—Gerry, Jeff, Danny—they're thick as thieves. They spill everything.""

""I promise,"" Mary said. ""This is your call. I don't keep secrets from Gerry, but this one's yours.""

""Thanks, Mare. They'll all know soon enough.""

""How do you think Jeff'll take it?""

Angie smiled softly. ""Based on how he handled us becoming a couple and moving in? He'll need time to adjust. Big changes scare him. But he'll be a great husband—and an even better dad.""

""Husband?"" Mary's eyes lit up.

""Yup. This baby's gonna have married parents. City Hall, quick and simple. Once I know for sure, I'm telling him—six months living together, it's time to make it official.""

""You go, girl!"" Mary said. ""Gerry and I will be right there with you.""

""Maid of honor and best man? That's a given,"" Angie said.

""Oh, man, look at the time,"" Mary said, glancing at her watch. ""We gotta get back. I'm so happy for you, Angie. Best news ever.""

""And I'm so happy you're my best friend, Mare,"" Angie said. ""Makes everything better.""",1,1760648616.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

Without giving too many specifics, as I’d rather not name the company in question, an example would be if I had a branded bottle of syrup Dunkin’ uses for their coffees. It’s a physical product, so maybe I’m just not understanding how it can be considered counterfeit or infringing on a trademark.

As I read the words, they echoed in my mind.
She is perfect.

The handwriting was neat. Careful, almost gentle. That made it worse.
I kept staring until the letters blurred together. Each time I blinked, I saw the flash of the camera again, white and violent behind my eyes.

My sister was still asleep in the other bed, face pressed into the hotel pillow. I didn’t want to wake her. I just needed air. I know I wouldn’t be able to sleep.

The sun was barely up when I found myself back at the coffee shop. Habit dragged me there before reason could stop me. I needed fuel. I couldn’t rest and needed some sort of pick me up.

The bell above the door chimed the same way it always did. Same stale smell of beans and sugar. Same barista behind the counter. Mark, I think. The guy who always remembered my order, asked about my day, laughed at the dumb jokes I made. It was nice to see a friendly face. 

“Rough night?” he said, smiling. “Haven’t seen you this early in a while.”

I forced a grin, slid a few crumpled bills across the counter. “Yeah. Something like that.”

He wrote my name on the cup, like always. The pen scraped lightly against the cardboard. The sound piercing my ears as if I was hungover from emotions.

As he made his way over to the counter to hand me my coffee he slid the money back to me. 

“This one is on the house. Hopefully a nice start to a perfect day.”

That word. That god damn word. 

“She is PERFECT.” Those 3 words ringing in my head again.

I let out an uncomfortable laugh as I said “Thanks, man.”

He slid the coffee over to me. My name on the cup in red marker. 

The handwriting, it looked familiar. I had seen this before. Was I just being delusional? I’m not sure. But I FELT like I had seen it before.

“She misses you, you know.”

I slowly began to look up.

“What?”

“Your niece, I’m sure she misses you.”

What was happening? The news, he must have seen it on the news. The case was getting a lot of coverage over the last 24 hours. 


“Yeah,” I said, clearing my throat. “It’s… it’s been rough on everyone.”

Mark nodded, still smiling that same easy smile. But something about his eyes didn’t match. They were focused, like he was studying me.

“She came in here with you that one time.” He said softly. “Hot chocolate, extra whipped cream. Cute kid.”

My stomach tightened.

“You remember that?”

“Of course. I remember everyone who walks through that door.”

“Listen, I should…”

“You left this here last time.”

Mark reached under the counter and slid a small paper sleeve toward me. A corner of glossy paper peeked out.

My chest tightened. I pulled it free just enough to see the image and everything inside me went still.

It was my niece’s school photo. The same one that hung on my sister’s fridge. The same one I kept in my wallet, behind my badge.

“Where did you get this?”

Mark smiled, kind and unbothered, like we were talking about the weather. “Your sister should really lock her windows.”

The coffee shop noise seemed to fade, replaced by a dull ringing in my ears. My hand drifted instinctively toward my holster.

“Don’t” he said quietly. “If you pull that thing out, you’ll never see her again.”

My throat went dry.

“Where is she?” I managed.

He leaned forward, elbows on the counter. His voice softened, almost pitying.
“You told me all about her. Her name. Her school. The way she scrunches her nose when she laughs. You even showed me this picture yourself.”

I tried to remember. I didn’t want to believe it but I could hear myself doing it. Talking too much over coffee. Filling silence with small talk.

He slid the photo closer. My name was written on the back in red ink.

“She’s perfect” he whispered. “Just like you said.”

The bell over the door chimed behind me. Someone came in for their morning latte. I blinked and the photo was gone. Just my cup of coffee, cooling on the counter.

I looked to Mark. 
 

“If you don’t want her to end up like the others,” he said, barely above a whisper, “you’ll listen to exactly what I say.”

He didn’t blink. He didn’t raise his voice. He just stood there, calm, like we were still two regulars talking about the weather.

My pulse was hammering so hard I thought everyone in the shop could hear it.
“What did you do to her?”

Mark tilted his head slightly, almost disappointed.

“That’s not the question you should be asking.”

A woman behind me laughed at something on her phone. The milk steamer hissed. Life went on, like the world didn’t notice what was happening right in front of them.

“You’re going to go home” he continued. “You’re going to act normal. You’re not going to tell anyone about this conversation. Not your sister, not your detective friends. You’ll hear from me when it’s time. If you do anything stupid, she’ll end up like the others.”

He said it so simply, like it wasn’t a threat just a fact.

I stared at him, waiting for a tremor, a flinch, something. But he just smiled that same polite smile he gave every customer.

“Have a good day, Officer.”

He turned toward the next person in line.
And just like that, I wasn’t a customer anymore. I was a hostage.

I walked out before he could say anything else. The bell over the door chimed behind me, the same cheerful sound I’d heard a hundred times before, but it felt different now, hollow, mocking.

The air outside hit cold against my face. Morning rush hour had started and people were crossing the street with their coffees, laughing, living in a world that hadn’t been flipped upside down.

Mine had.

I stood there on the sidewalk, gripping the cup he’d handed me. The cardboard was warm against my skin, but my hands were shaking. I kept telling myself to breathe, to think, to do something. Call the precinct. Call anyone.

But his words kept replaying in my head.

“You’ll listen to exactly what I say.”

It wasn’t the threat that scared me, it was the certainty. He said it like he’d already won.",6,1760648482.0,nosleep,5,1.0,False
1o8i4h7,https://i.redd.it/ezezqn6qdjvf1.png,New To The Hall - a TK Fanfiction (Part 3),"# S3 - Girl Talk

*\[Meanwhile, in apartment 9A\]*

Kathrin closes the door behind her, happy that she's met someone new. She heads to the kitchen and makes herself a nice mild latté, not bad for an early autumn afternoon. The leaves haven't begun to fall yet, that’s the season that she enjoys the most.

Kathrin brings her coffee to the lounge and sets it down on the table, noticing Willow down the hallway, stepping out of the bathroom, completely nude.

**WILLOW:** “Kat? I need your help…”

**KAT:** “What with?”

**WILLOW:** “Do my back markings look symmetrical?”

**KAT:** “They do to me.”

**WILLOW:** “Okay, thanks. Thought they were still messed up after our beach trip last weekend.”

**KAT:** “No worries, Willow!”

Willow then withdraws to the closet just opposite the bathroom. Kathrin then turns on the TV to watch the highlights from yesterday's hockey game.

***TV:*** *“A very low scoring affair took place as the North Leighton Rafters hosted a zero to one loss to the Edinmire Brown Tails, with one single shot on target all game.”*

**KAT:** “At least we won, but I wouldn't have wanted to watch that.”

As the presenters on the TV ramble on about Edinmire’s playoff hopes being called into question, somebody knocks on the front door. Kathrin immediately puts her coffee down onto the table and goes to answer the door.

**KAT:** “Cass! Hello!”

**CASS:** “Hey there Kat, can we come in?”

**KAT:** “You don't need to ask, go ahead!”

Kathrin steps back and lets Cassidy walk into the apartment. She is followed by Laura, who is blushing, but not as heavily as she was earlier. She is wearing one of Cassidy’s flannel shirts though.

**KAT:** “Laura, are you okay?”

**LAURA:** “Y-yes… just a bit embarrassed t-that I left m-my key.” 

Kathrin knows that's not the real reason, but doesn't press her.

**KAT:** “Oh, I understand. Have a rest in the lounge, I'm going to make you two drinks.”

Kathrin gets Cassidy a cold root beer and Laura some Red Nora - which tastes like shit, but the sponsorship money was too high to turn down for a bit of crappy caffeine. She brings their drinks to the lounge, where Cass and Laura are sitting on the couch. Laura is being very touchy with Cassidy today, leaning on her chest whilst getting her head rubbed.

**KAT:** “She’s pretty touchy today.”

**CASS:** “Yup, this is her afterglow. It won't last too long.”

The implication is clear, but Kathrin doesn't pry.

**KAT:** “Anyway, I am happy to say I’m already friends with one of the new neighbors!”

**CASS:** “Which one?”

**KAT:** “The kind fox, Mike.”

**CASS:** “That’s lovely to hear Kat, anything in particular about him that you like?”

Kathrin thinks for a few seconds before responding brightly.

**KAT:** “He’s very kind, he is cute, and he clearly wants to get to know me!”

Suddenly, the slightly muffled voice of Willow in the closet is heard.

***WILLOW:*** *“Clear as day!”*

**KAT:** “Willow? What did you say?”

The closet door is locked open, and Willow emerges from it, wearing only a baggy t-shirt that goes down to her thighs.

**WILLOW**: “You *like* him, don't you?”

**KAT:** “Well…” 

**WILLOW:** “Come on, you called him cute! You definitely *like* him!”

**KAT:** “Willow, stop being ridiculous. I have just met him!”

**WILLOW:** “Trust me, soon you’ll realise how you truly feel!”

**KAT:** “But—”

**WILLOW:** “Either way, I’m going to go back to the closet and watch the afternoon debate… remember to admit you love him, Kat!”

Just like that, Willow steps back into the closet and closes the door.

**CASS:** “That was confusing.”

**KAT:** “Well… it's not entirely untrue.”

This subtle admission of her feelings makes Laura lift her head from Cassidy’s chest and finally start paying attention… kinda.

**LAURA:** “You have feelings for a fox?”

**KAT:** “Kind of?”

**LAURA:** “I-I’m taken!”

**CASS:** “Not you, you silly little bugger!”

Cassidy scratches the top of Laura’s head, causing her to back down and snuggle back against Cassidy’s chest.

**CASS:** “You’re lucky you are so cute \~”

**LAURA:** *“Mmm… s-shut up…”*

**CASS:** “How about you go to your bedroom, and I’ll join you in a minute?”

**LAURA:** *“W-why…?”*

**CASS:** “Because I wanna talk to Kat, we can start *streaming* too\*…\*”

**LAURA:** *“Okay… love you \~”*

**CASS:** “I love you too.”

Laura stands up and staggers to her bedroom, still blushing heavily & wearing Cassidy’s flannelette. Once she enters her bedroom, Cassidy turns towards Kathrin with a serious expression on her face.

**CASS:** “So, you said you *might* have feelings for… Mike, was it?”

**KAT:** “Yes? But I am not fully sure about it…”

Cassidy looks away for a second, before noticing her phone’s background - a picture of her and Laura at a music concert.

**CASS:** “Let me tell you something: I was in your exact same position with Laura. She was the one who had the strongest feelings, though mine weren’t as obvious.”

Cassidy unlocks her phone and shows her a picture from the gallery - their first date.

**CASS:** “My point is, if you feel these feelings, don’t try and hide them. Tell them how you truly feel.”

**KAT:** “I never thought of that…”

**CASS:** “Not only that, it’s quite clear that Mike *likes* you. But don’t go sneaking into the bushes too early. It can result in heartbreak, from what I’ve seen.”

Kathrin processes what she’s been told for a brief moment, formulating intentions in her head on how to act upon her feelings.

**CASS:** “Now if you excuse me, I am going to go and *stream* with Laura.”

**KAT:** “Okay, thanks for taking the time to talk with me!”

**CASS:** “My pleasure.”

Cassidy enters Laura’s room, where a brief soundbite from a video game can be heard. Are they *actually* going to stream? Or are they going to do *something else*?

Whatever they end up doing, it will not bother Kat. She sits back on the couch and watches the rest of the hockey gameday review, still with the same latté in hand.

…

***LAURA:*** *“Motherfucker!”*

Well, I guess they are *streaming*.

1o8i320,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVWriting/comments/1o8i320/the_48hour_script_crisis_that_changed_everything/,The 48-Hour Script Crisis That Changed Everything,"Every writer hits that wall — the one where your talent can’t save you, your “potential” doesn’t pay rent, and your story refuses to make sense.



I had two days before a script deadline on a crime drama pilot my team and I were working on. 



A producer who our team had pitched a concept to was waiting. 



We talked a big game. But our script? 



It was a complete mess. Half-hearted characters, a broken spine and no real flair.



We tried everything….



Coffee, deleting pages, rewriting scenes that didn’t even deserve saving. 



I was lost. The story had no internal logic. I was standing in the middle of a maze with no map.



And then something clicked, I had a ¨AHA¨ moment. 



It wasn’t about rules, theories or formulas.



It was about relationships — between acts, characters, and emotional beats. Between who the protagonist was and who they had to become.



That’s when I started building my own frameworks — combining Syd Field, Hero’s Journey, Save The Cat, and what I now call Story Structure Secrets.



That 48-hour meltdown became a lab experiment.



I printed every major framework on my wall — Field, Vogler, Snyder, Truby, Harmon — and started connecting dots.



What I found wasn’t a formula. It was a pattern.



Every great story moves like a heartbeat: setup → disruption → pursuit → collapse → rebirth.



Once I saw that, my script came alive.



I stopped writing scenes and started designing shifts, turning points and reveals.



Moments that actually MOVE the story instead of just decorating it



Most writers think structure is a cage. It’s not. It’s choreography.



It’s how your story breathes and moves with grace.



When you understand rhythm, you stop forcing your characters to “hit beats” and start letting their choices create beats.



That’s why a strong midpoint twist doesn’t feel mechanical — it feels inevitable.



Because it’s the heartbeat reaching its second pulse.



The audience might not understand act breaks, but they \*feel\* imbalance.



If your story doesn’t turn when it’s supposed to, they know.



If your character “changes” without consequence, they know.



If your climax doesn’t earn its emotion — they know.



Structure isn’t there to impress producers. It's there to guide emotion. To create resonance that lingers after the credits roll.



That 48-hour lesson wasn’t just about screenwriting.



It’s how I now approach business. Funnels, offers, content — all of it is story architecture. 



Every launch is a narrative. Every client journey is a character arc. 



Setup → Challenge → Transformation → Win.



Once I realized that, I stopped being “just a writer” and started building as a story architect.



That script didn’t just meet the deadline. It sold.



And more importantly, it rewired how I write, teach, and build.



Because structure isn’t a prison — it’s permission to create with purpose… to finish… to win.

I'll never stop looking for friends. I never will. 

I wanted to say I'd hope that keeps on going and you can stick to me like caramel. 

I will close this for the introverts here reading this post as this post is coming to an end, do I really enjoy being an introvert? Would I get out of the gardens of gardens that aren't dripping with caramel because of anxiety being stuck with me? Would I change who I'm as a person?

Well no I simply and truthfully wouldn't, there is one thing nobody has ever gotten from me from Reddit even though people from Reddit think I'm a bot because my lifestyle activities are basically a bot and that's all I'd do is bot my activities daily. However, did you know once I decided to never think that this stage is a prison? 
I once in my 33 years of life wanted to become someone with a social life, go to daily events in my town, try out a job and try to be social. Which yeah, for me ended up being  a terrifying experience, I didn't enjoy myself, I wasn't happy, I didn't feel safe with myself and I would rather be in my complex only coming out only once or twice a week then going back into hiding for a few days and sometimes if the social anxiety is bad I don't go out but once a week.

Wouldn't you want me to feel safe, happy and even if that meant that I had to bot my life every single day with my activities? Cats, naps, Sleep Token lore, music, Skyrim PS4, playing Nintendo Switch games with online friends Co-Op mode tea, sometimes energy drinks, sometimes coffee, YT, watching Sleep Token reels from  a YT content creator that post new Sleep Token reels and what if I told you this made me happy botting my life every single day? Wouldn't you want me happy?
 
I'm also not embarrassed to tell my online introverted friend that I plan on living on SSI and EBT for a very long time, because I don't have the luxury life of my family has gifted me a luxurious garden when they all pass away.

Yeah, with that being said and this post coming to a close don't comment on this post, I don't want people commenting on my posts, I would rather you send me a medium or long winded chat request to keep me engaged and interested in you. How about, you can hit me with your Sleep Token one liners?

1o8hu19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1o8hu19/happy_bday_to_me/,Happy b’day to me,"
Today I turned 25.

I’ve made it through these years somehow — not with great effort or luck, just by going with the flow.

The past two years, I was unemployed. Peaceful years, actually… not fun or exciting, but calm in their own way. There’s a strange comfort in doing nothing, even when it feels like you’re falling behind. 😂

I’m 25, and I’ve never been in a relationship. Maybe I never met the right person.
Or maybe I’m too insecure, too closed off, or just not ready to let anyone in.
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t know the answer.

I don’t have many friends. The few I have — I rarely message.
I live abroad now, and I call my family maybe once a week. Not because I don’t care, just… I don’t know. I keep things to myself a lot.

Growing up, we didn’t have much money. But my parents gave me love, comfort, and support — and that mattered more than anything else.

During the pandemic, I met a friend online.
We became really close for a few years. She understood me in a way no one else did.
But, like most good things, that connection slowly faded.

Last night, she was the only one who wished me at midnight.
And for some reason, it hurt.
I couldn’t reply warmly. I told her that it would’ve been easier if she hadn’t remembered. Maybe that was selfish, or maybe it was just me trying to protect myself.

So, how did I spend my birthday?
It was my off day. I cleaned up, groomed myself, got a free cake from McDonald’s, had a coffee, and then took a long nap. Simple. Quiet. Peaceful.

And now, here I am — writing this.
I don’t even know why. Maybe I just needed to put these thoughts somewhere.
Maybe I just wanted someone to read it and silently understand.

Anyway… yeah.
It’s my birthday.

Thought I'd share impressions since we've all been so excited and curious about the new and unusual holiday flavor combinations.

  
If it helps to know, I always drink flavored ones with frothed whole or oat milk (whole this time), and about a tablespoon of Italian sweet cream to bring out the flavor.

  
Cinnamon/Tamarind: Primarily cinnamon forward, and strong enough to stand out as opposed to the weaker nature of some of Nespresso's flavored coffees. Naturally I was super curious how they'd implement a flavor as exotic as tamarind, and I'm almost relieved to say it sits mostly in the background. I actually love tamarind flavor but I wasn't sure I was ready for it in coffee form. It's there, but barely and more in scent than in taste. Happy to report the combination works really well and whether or not you like tamarind, you will probably like this one if you like cinnamon.

Sweet Almond/Hibiscus: I was not looking forward to this as I'm fairly averse to hibiscus. I lived in northern Mexico for a while where jamaica agua fresca was hugely popular and I just hated it for some reason. This however is freaking *amazing.* I am *shocked*. First of all, the almond is *so* pronounced. It's funny, I was just drinking an Almond Croissant yesterday and thinking how it and Sunny Almond Vanilla/Active are, while tasty, so awfully weak in the almond area. This is not. It's almost marizpan-ish in the best way. And the hibiscus component connects flawlessly with zero of the bitter, herbal, floral tea-like elements I was worried about. Rather, it's fruity, and while I can't put my finger on exactly which fruit, every time I take a sip I immediately think of an almond berry scone. It is *magical* and definitely going to be the one I go insane over and stock up for the apocalypse before it goes away.

It was on her third day at her new job that Katherine first noticed the strange occurrences at the orphanage. It started with little things, like a light shiver running down her spine or a sudden all-encompassing fear that would shoot through her body whenever she walked past the locked room on the top floor. Though back then, she had thought nothing of it, choosing to focus on her job instead. However, soon, the strange occurrences seemed to become bigger or stronger, almost like the room was calling out to her.

She brought these concerns up to sister Maria, the head of the orphanage, only to receive a glare and a thorough telling off of how 'it wasn't lady-like to be so curious'. She had hung her head in shame and swiftly apologised for her wrongdoings, but she had not missed the curious way that sister Maria had reacted to the question; how her back straightened upon mention of the room, how the grip on her morning coffee became more strained, and, most curious of all, the way she had glanced worriedly in the direction of the room when she thought Katherine wasn't looking. Though, after the scolding that Katherine had received, she decided it best not to bring up anything more about the room. And so, a week later, Katherine found herself losing interest in the room. A month later, she had completely forgotten that the conversation had ever taken place, and a year later, she had nearly forgotten the existence of the room altogether.

It was nearly seventeen years after the conversation and many years after the death of Sister Maria that Katherine had felt a shiver going through her body while passing the room again. The conversation from seventeen years ago sprung to her mind, and Katherine found her curiosity from all those years ago coming with it. Nothing was stopping her from entering the room now. The children had all gone to bed, and there was no sister Maria to stare disapprovingly at her once she was caught. Mind made up, she brought her hand up to the brass doorknob and slowly pushed the door open.

At first glance, there was nothing special about the room. There were the standard desks and chairs that occupied many of the rooms, and the room itself was not very big. Though on closer inspection, Katherine found her gaze captivated by a golden mirror at the back of the room. Unlike the rest of the room, which was ashen and grey, this mirror stood tall and proud and seemed to shine. With a glance behind her, Katherine fully stepped into the room, shutting the door quietly behind her. 

As she walked towards the mirror, she felt another much stronger shudder run down her back, and just as she did before, Katherine felt the all-encompassing fear that had hit her so strongly seventeen years before. Not one to be easily discouraged, Katherine ignored the negative feelings, and when she finally stood in front of the mirror, she raised her hand and lightly touched the intricate, golden edge of the object. At first, nothing happened and Katherine found herself staring at her reflection, though seconds later, she felt an almost impossible pull towards the mirror, and before she could stop herself, she was reaching forward towards the glass with her other hand, coming closer and closer until she was centimetres from touching her reflection. Katherine found herself unable to look away, and the longer she stared, the more mesmerised she became.

Her reflection looked so clear and real that for a moment, Katherine felt as though she were the reflection, and looking back at her was the real her. Unable to stop herself, Katherine reached forward to touch the lifelike reflection, and suddenly, a burst of light escaped the mirror, lighting up the whole room and encompassing her hand and her whole body. 

Pain unlike anything she had ever felt before shot through her body, a thousand times worse than anything she could have ever imagined. She felt as though she were being ripped to shreds and all the while, the mirror had not stopped pulling and pulling and pulling until Katherine's whole body had disappeared from the room, and in her place was nothing but golden dust, which seemed to twinkle were the young woman once stood. The light from the mirror slowly dimmed, and the room became ashen and grey once more.
--------------------------------------------------
Elijah knew that something was wrong the moment he had woken up. He couldn't describe exactly what it was, only that he had woken up with the sense that there was something dangerous that was about to happen. This feeling only seemed to get worse whenever he passed the room on the top floor,  which was barricaded off with bright neon yellow tape.

His inner turmoil must have been obvious, for during breakfast that morning in the lunch hall, Sam turned to him with a slightly worried look in his brown eyes, before understanding dawned on him. 

""One of the sisters went missing in that room,"" Sam explained, piling another serving of lumpy mash onto his dinner plate. That was the problem with the orphanage, it didn't matter what quality the food was, as long as the children were fed something. Still, Elijah thought, it was better than living out on the street ""She went in last night and just didn't come back out""

""Well it were her own fault,"" Frederick added, taking a seat opposite Elijah and Sam and glaring at his own plate of cold vegetable stew, before leaning in closer and turning his green eyes onto Elijah, ""Everyone knows that the room on the third floor is locked for good reason""

""Really? why?"" Elijah asked. He'd never heard of anything bad happening in that room. In fact, he'd never even heard of anything bad happening at the orphanage at all, what with the strict rules everyone was forced to adhere to.

""Yeah, the sisters are real secretive about the room, rumour has it that that's where they'd send the bad children. One hour in that room and they came back changed. Never did a bad thing for the rest of their time here,"" Frederick was staring at Elijah with wide, fearful eyes, but the illusion was ruined by the slight smirk that pulled at his thin lips. When Elijah rolled his eyes and shoved the other boy, Frederick broke out into raucous laughter.

""oh Fred, you can be a real idiot sometimes,"" Elijah admonished, ""Aren't you at all curious? I mean it's impossible for someone to just disappear like that, especially in a place like this""

""She didn't disappear, I'll tell ya exactly what happened. Sister Katherine got bored of the strict rules and the constant need for order here and decided that she'd much rather live somewhere far away from this place,"" Frederick shot back. Gone was his previous mirth, replaced, instead, by the dead eyes and monotone voice that often took over when describing a place such as Fulham.

Fulham's House for Lost Boys was an orphanage that took in abandoned children, who were looked after by the Nun's of the nearby church. While it was widely thought that the church cared for the boys out of the goodness of their own heart, the truth was that the boys that lived here were cheap, easy labour. From the minute the sun rose till dusk, Fulham boys were put to work. Whether it be cleaning, cooking, organising papers, or even helping out at the church, there was never a day where the boys weren't working. The rules here were simple; you get a roof over your head, and food to fill your stomach as long as you did whatever was expected of you.

But no matter how bad the conditions in the orphanage were, it was a thousand times better than being stranded on the cold streets of London, forced to fend for yourself.

A sudden silence descended across the lunch hall as Sister Agatha cleared her throat. She stood proudly at the front of the hall, her hands held behind her back as she called for everyone's attention. Her face was morphed into her signature scowl, so common that she would probably be unrecognisable if she ever smiled,  ""Attention everyone! very good. As you all have probably heard by now, our dear Sister Katherine is no longer with us. Now, I understand this must be a distressing time for you all,"" She announced, glaring at the boys, as if daring them to argue with her.

""But that does not mean that you can become lazy. All chores are to be performed as usual, and are expected to be up to usual standards. A service will be held for Sister Katherine at exactly eight o'clock this evening, which you must all attend. Attendance will be taken, and any students found missing will be severely punished. Now you have,"" here she looked towards her pocket watch, ""Eight minutes to finish your meals and get back to work."" 

She nodded once, signalling the end of her speech, before leaving the hall. As soon as she had disappeared, Elijah turned to Sam, ""No longer with us?"" he asked, confused, ""but I thought that she was just missing? It doesn't make sense, how could they have already pronounced her dead if she had only been gone since last night""

Sam shook his head, his red curls bouncing with the movement, "" it doesn't matter Eli, and it'll do you no good thinking about it. I know what's about to happen, and I'm telling you right now, do not, under any circumstances, try to hold your own investigation, do you hear me? You are not to enter that room no matter what"".

""I hear you,"" Elijah replied bitterly, ""But aren't you curious? The sisters have to be hiding something""

Sam was shaking his head before Elijah had even finished speaking, ""No I am not, and if you know what's good for you, you'll forget all about the room""

Elijah nodded once more, and that was the last they spoke about the room that day.

But it seemed no matter how hard he tried, he could not forget about the room. That night, after the service, Elijah lay awake in his too small bed and tried to make sense of everything. Sister Katherine was one of the good Sisters, always allowing children to sleep in when it was her turn to do the morning runs. Always allowing boys to take a break in her office if they got too tired. So it didn't make any sense for her to suddenly leave the boys alone when she seemed to care for them so much.

What was even more confusing was how she was being pronounced dead before there had even been a proper search for her. There was no body during the service, which meant that she had still not been found. She had only been missing since the night before, surely they had to wait a few days before pronouncing her dead? And what was so special about the room. If sister Katherine had simply run away, there would be no need to block off the room for so long.
There were so many questions and no answers and Elijah felt he would go mad if he didn't at least try to find some sort of explanation. Surely, it wouldn't be too bad if he snuck into the room for a few seconds, just to reassure his mind that nothing strange was actually going on. 

Yes, that seemed like a good idea. He'd sneak into the room, do his own little search, and when nothing came up, he could go with the story that Sister Katherine had indeed passed away. Mind made up, Elijah tried his best to be as quite as possible as he slipped out of bed, so as not to  disturb his roommates. Shutting the door as quietly as he could, he made his way to the room, trying his best to avoid the creaky floorboards and thin walls.

Upon entering the room, Elijah's eyes were immediately drawn towards the mirror. It was very extravagant, probably the most luxurious mirror Elijah had ever seen. The closer he got, the more he seemed to notice the intricate detailing around the mirror. It had a golden border that seemed to shine in the bright room. Elijah was so captivated by the mirror that he had completely forgotten why he'd come here in the first place.

When he saw his reflection, Elijah's breath caught in his throat. His reflection looked almost ethereal, unreal. His blonde hair seemed to glow, his usually pasty skin seemed shiny, a healthy pink dusting his cheeks. Slowly, Elijah lifted his hand towards his reflection. When his hand made contact with the glass, he felt a pleasant warmth shoot up his arm. That was odd. Elijah pulled his hand back and placed it on his reflection once more. Again, he felt that warmness jolt through his arm.

It was a pleasant feeling, that left a slight tingling in his arm. He lifted his hand off the glass and reached forward to touch it once more. His fingers lightly grazed the glass, and he leaned in closer, he wanted to put his whole body against the mirror. Wanted to feel that warmth all over him. He took a step closer to the mirror. He wanted to wrap his arms around it, keep it close.

""Elijah!"" A voice whispered harshly, and Elijah was pulled out of his daze, turning towards the door to find Sam staring at him in horror. His red hair was wild and his eyes were red rimmed, a clear sign that he had just woken up, ""Elijah what are you doing?!""

""I-""

""It doesn't matter, step away from the mirror and come back to bed! If one of the Sisters see us then that's it, we'll be beaten within an inch of our lives! Come on!"" Sam sounded frantic now, and Elijah understood why. The Sisters were definitely not shy when it came to handing out punishments
.
""I- yes you're right,"" he replied, slightly ashamed, and took a step forward. Except, he very quickly found, he could not. The hand that had been touching the mirror was stuck, and it did not matter how much he pulled, it would not budge.

""I don't think I can Sam"" He whispered, his voice slightly shaking. What was wrong? Why couldn't he move arm?

""What do you mean you can't?!"" Sam shouted back.

""I mean my arms stuck!"" He answered as calmly as he could. All he had to do was stay calm. Control his breathing. Yes, everything was fine. Surely there was a way to get his arm out.

""Oh Jesus! I told you not to snoop Elijah! Try pulling!"" Sam cried, completely unhelpfully 

""Oh thank you Samuel, I hadn't thought to try that!"" 

""Well try harder! Hurry!"" He cried once more, and Elijah turned back to see the lights downstairs  turn on. Oh no, they'd woken up Sister Agatha.

Elijah turned back to the mirror,  shut his eyes and with a deep breath pulled his arm with all his might, and for a jolt, he thought that he had done it. He could feel a slight breeze against that arm that was stuck in the mirror, and for one second he thought he was free. But his short lived triumph was slowly replaced by fear as he watched his arm get completely sucked through he mirror.

""Oh my God!"" He cried, and the fear that he had been feeling turned into full blown panic and horror when he found that the mirror was still pulling. In seconds, Elijah's leg and shoulder were being pulled into the mirror.

""Elijah!"" Sam cried once more, running to his friend and grabbing onto his arm, pulling as hard as he could. It was a futile attempt for the minute Sam's hand grabbed onto Elijah, both boys were pulled into the mirror and in their place lay a pile of golden dust, which twinkled in the dark room.
------------------------------------
Sister Agatha awoke to the sound of harsh screams coming out of the room upstairs. It took a few seconds for her to realise why that was strange, but when she remembered the mirror and the dangers of the room, she jumped out of bed and ran up the stairs.

When she entered the room, she was greeted with the sight of pile of shimmering gold dust which lay just in front of the mirror. That cursed mirror. When sister Maria had passed, Agatha was given the job of leader of the orphanage. Upon reading a letter addressed to the next head, written by Sister Maria.

That cursed mirror. When sister Maria had passed, Agatha was given the job of leader of the orphanage. There were two things that were passed down to here. The first was her golden pocket watch, an heirloom that was passed down from leader to leader of the orphanage. The second was a letter addressed to the next head, written by Sister Maria, explaining why the room on the top floor should be watched carefully. 

Her first course of action as head was to get rid of the damned mirror, but she had been advised by many of the elders at the church that the mirror had been here for too long, that there was too much history behind the mirror that they could not simply just give it away. And now, as she stared down at the ashes of the children who had been taken by the mirror, she couldn't help but think about how wrong she was to have listened to the elders. First sister Katherine, and now two of her own boys from Fulham's, how many more would the mirror take? Was it really so important that they would be willing to risk so many lives?


A sharp burning sensation in her pocket pulled her out of her turmoil, and Agatha reached in and slowly pulled out the - Pocket watch? She didn't even remember placing it in her pocket when she'd woken up. She lifted the golden watch closer to inspect it, and to her utter confusion, she saw that it had stopped at precisely three o'clock.

Only looking for women for obvious reasons.

I live in germany and connecting with people is maybe my favorite thing. I'm afraid I'm not your typical german. There are (a lot of) times I feel like I don't belong here.


I find it hard to connect. I can talk to anyone, make friends and do things but truly connecting with someone is different. I want to understand how they function, what makes them smile, sad or angry. I want to understand how they view the world.

There are times I feel like I don't belong in this world because of the way I am. I have always had to adapt but deep down I'm a silly weird puppy. I yap a lot and when I get excited, I really get excited. I also like to be kind and want to help whenever I can. Standing up for people is very important to me because I didn't have that as a child, so of course I will want to do that.

I long to belong. It's hard for me to describe. I mean the things I say and I'm very loyal. I want to sit in silence and be okay with that. I want silence full of beauty and vulnerability. Vulnerability is so incredibly important to me, so is growth. I find growing to be painful but it is necessary and I need it.

I really need to grow. I'm not the type to stay comfortable all my life.

There are times in life in which I feel aimless, lost and then there are times I feel peaceful and know that tomorrow is a new day. I want to talk, share my experiences, share my pain and the things I want in life. I simply want to live to the fullest, with all the pain I have in me, all the laughter and the random thoughts. I want to share all of it.

I want to connect so deeply. I want to be vulnerable and experience everything so deeply and fully. I want it all. I really want it all. Some people want a lot of money or career. For me, it's connecting. It has always been that way and I don't mind it.

I'm very accepting and do not like to judge. Some get surprised how accepting I am but yeah.

The boring things: I like coffee quite a lot. I do a pour over every morning. I starting crochet and painting abstract. I also like to move my body and enjoy nature, traveling and so much more. I'm open to a lot of things. I can be introverted and switch to extroversion real quick - it depends. Watching movies/tv series is also nice.

Psychology is very important to me and analyzing people is something I do automatically at this point.

I don't know what you want in life but if you feel like you want the same thing, let me know.

1o8hk4x,https://i.redd.it/ro039b4k2jvf1.png,Picked the riverland farm as a noob and im determinded to make it work. Any critiques of my planned layout welcomed.,"Any insights or warnings on my future plans very much  welcomed. By make it work i do mean create something that both makes money, looks nice and has a variety of features, i don't necessarily want to max the money i can squeeze out of every tile but it is a consideration.  What i have here on the planner is a mix of our current farm, what i want it to look like in the future and some stuff i threw in as filler for the post(mostly random grass and solar panels).

* **Northen Island:** This will have the biggest concentration of money crops when accounting for the greenhouse. Whatever the most profitable crop for the season on the outside and a mix of things i want growing all year inside like the star fruits i understand are best(eventually ancient fruit), coffee and maybe a patch for a recipe i'll consume often. It also has 6 ponds in the middle covering a non tillable patch that i'm planning to fill up with roe producing fish; i currently have The Legend, Glacier Fish, Mutant Carp and a blob fish. I plan to put the crimson fish in the fifth pond and lava eels on the 6th and replace the blob fish with another lava eel. I understand lava eels sometimes produce a sought after food item from time to time on top of being relatively as profitable as the least profitable legends. Is filled entirely with preserve  jars meant to process the crops and the fish roe.
* **Large Central Island:** this is the biggest change from what we have to what we're planning on. Currently this area has our animals and a cabin but  i modified the farm on the planner to have some sheds and crops instead. I felt like it was too much space to use just on animals. Now i'm thinking one shed can be filled with kegs and the other crystalariums. Also, it can have extra space for crops. The grass here is filler, i'll probably rearrange things here to fit more crops or a third shed instead.
* **Small Central Island:** by far the most basic one, just a shed meant to have random processing machines like furnaces, smokers and dehydrators. On the topic of dehydrators i recently planted a maple, pine and oak forest in the Train area that im planning to tap and place mushroom logs in.
* **Western and Southwestern Islands:** this is where i'm eventually planning to move the animals and merged the two using lightning rods and a gate so the animals have room to roam around. Currently unsure if they'll have enough grass here, after counting the tiles they have almost as much as back in the central island which they weren't eating all of before. This is also where i have some lighting rods meant to produce batteries and to abuse the trick that prevents some grass patches from being eaten and reproducing. There's also a fish pond here i'm considering eliminating if it turns out i need more grass.
* **Eastern Island:** I came up with honey for this area when trying to find something that could take advantage of that pier space that wasn't better off inside a shed. Currently this is the layout i found uses the space the best but i might end up changing it up to be more aesthetically pleasing.
* **Southern Island:** I love fish ponds! Here i plan to have some fish also meant for food not necessarily money. Specifically one eel for the fish and lava eel for cash and spicy eel.

I strongly considered starting over when i realized this farm was so limited but i'm having so much fun making the most out of it so now i have a hard time considering any other lay out lol.",5,1760647036.0,StardewValley,6,0.86,False

**Source:** [A Critical Shortage: Immigration Enforcement Meets Agricultural Labor Crisis](https://www.lawsb.com/trumps-deportation-agenda-triggers-labor-gaps-and-food-price-risks/)

**What’s happening:**

* The Labor Department just admitted in a new rule that stricter immigration enforcement is worsening the agricultural labor crisis.
* Farms can’t find enough legal workers even with higher wages, and domestic workers aren’t filling the gap.
* The agency warned that without a stable workforce, food supply chains could be disrupted and prices will keep climbing.
* The administration is also proposing to cut H-2A visa wages, which could lower costs for growers but increase worker exploitation risks.
* Meanwhile, tariffs and trade tensions are already hiking prices for staples like beef and coffee.

**Why it matters:**  
Farmers are squeezed between labor shortages and policy pressure, while consumers see higher grocery bills. Legal workers, visa holders, and employers all face new compliance and risk issues under this mix of deportations and economic policy.

1o8hh11,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1o8hh11/stuck_at_the_beginning_of_my_phd_process/,Stuck at the Beginning of My PhD Process,"To provide some context: I completed my bachelor's degree at my local university in Spain, I'm Spanish (Sociology) and moved to Germany for my master's (Data Analysis). I did my internships and thesis in the empirical research department with my favorite subject's professor, who specializes in survey methodology.

Long story short, I made it clear from the begining of the internship that I wanted to pursue a PhD when the time came, and I therefore put forth my best effort both professionally and personally (I aimed to be polite, easy-going, and respectful), which yielded results as I achieved nearly the highest grades in everything I did with him. After graduating, we remained in contact, and we had a meeting in May to discuss possible funding options for the PhD. There were two: applying for project funding or a stipend. 

The pros and cons of the former are that it involves a slower process (six months of waiting for a response after applying) and a more demanding application (requiring proof that my work would significantly contribute to science), but it offers higher payment for me, albeit with greater responsibilities; the project is awarded to the department, and I would be hired for the project. To receive a PhD title, I would need to teach concurrently, along with all that entails. 

The latter option has a shorter processing time (three to four months) and a higher likelihood of acceptance due to more available options. My duties would merely involve conducting my research, which I could do remotely, needing to be present at the university only for meetings. However, it offers lower payment and prestige, along with fewer requirements for data sampling and significant conclusions. So I thim that I needed to think about it, and he asked if I was satisfied with my current job (data assistant for an airline). I expressed that it's boring, and while I don't love the schedules (I often work on the weekends) I'm stable, enjoy the office and my colleagues, and the pay is decent, so I'm not in a rush. Now, I’m beginning to think that telling him that was a big mistake.

One month after our meeting in June, I sent him a proposal text and a plan: let’s aim for project funding, and if that doesn’t work out, we can proceed with the stipend. I proposed having the stipend applications ready in case we weren’t accepted, so we could apply immediately and not waste time. 

Another month went by in July, and I informed him that I was gathering more data for the sample and provided updates: Institute X had informed me about the data process, and the statistical office of Country Y had shared relevant information. I received no response.

In August, I sent him another update with the final version of the data I gathered to enhance our sample. I asked if it was sufficient or if we should mention in the proposal that we were conducting our own survey for additional data. I even proposed two more funding calls and sought his opinion on whether they would be suitable for us. Still, there was no response.

Summer arrived, and I knew that in Germany, exams occur in July, there’s an important summer course that he teaches in August, and he likely goes on vacation in September. I waited all of September. I contacted his secretary, with whom I had established a good relationship during my two years working there. She told me he was on vacation and suggested I just emailed him, assuring me he would reply even while away (which I KNOW because he used to respond to my emails within hours when I was his student!). I told her I had already done that and expressed my complete understanding.

By October, I thought that if he was so busy, perhaps it would be easier to apply directly for the stipend since for the project funding he would need to revise, sign, and submit the project funding application as the head of the department. The stipend would be solely my responsibility with his signature. I even suggested involving a doctor from the department who had completed her PhD with stipend funding, hoping he might delegate (or dump) some responsibility to her. STILL, NOTHING. I can’t understand it.

As a last resort, I reached out to this doctor via WhatsApp, kindly explaining the situation and suggesting a brief coffee meeting just between us at the department, even joking about bringing cake. She didn’t respond.

I can’t bear the silence. Is it really that difficult to reply: “I don’t have time to meet; here’s a list of institutions you can apply to. Write the application, send me the final version, and I’ll sign it. Good luck.” Or even, “Listen, I can’t mentor your PhD right now; the priorities of the department have changed. Good luck in your search with another university.” It’s baffling to me that he used to reply within hours or a maximum of one or two days, and now he’s silent for months. Did I do something wrong? Did I offend his mother in some way? Why can’t he just tell me ""no"" in the worst case? Is he postponing this because I mentioned I’m not in a rush, and he interpreted that as me being willing to wait years, if necessary? 

What should I do? I don’t want to insist anymore; I think I’ll look desperate or even rude. But on the other hand, I have nothing to lose. What do you think is going on in his head? Should I insist, wait, or start searching for other professors at different universities? It’s not a broad field, so there aren’t many options, I would say a maximum of ten...

I have no idea why you’ve been on my mind just about every day for months, ever since I saw you at the coffee shop. A little disappointed that you had a boyfriend with you but it makes sense cus you’re a little irresistible. I wrote that poem for you so long ago and you were just supposed to take it and walk away; but you stuck around for a bit and honestly I had no idea what to do about it cus I was such a mess at that time. I had a lot of fun making shadow puppets laying in my bed and jabbering into the night. Going on walks or meeting up at some dingy bar for a few dad beers and some ridiculous conversations.  I’m gonna be honest I started smoking because of you and poetry. But mainly you. Stupid reasons, but you always wanted to have a smoke when I visited you at the martini lounge and I wanted to share in that instead of always bumming your Camels. In my mind it was our little fun thing. I stopped smoking B&Ms fyi. 

There’s always this little tickle in the back of my mind that said we could have been something but I was a little too dumb and wishy washy to catch the hints if there were any. And the other thoughts said that I was just a boy to toy with while you waited for the next one which inevitably happened; unsure if it was true or just my inaction that sent it that way. Either way it sucked.  I went to your home town last month near Chi and pulled out my phone to message you but I was like “ahhhh what’s the use. I can’t be this random and out of the blue. We’ve both moved on and shes probably a different person by now.” I still think you’re wonderful and you made me laugh so much. i should have been more comfortable with you cus you’re so easygoing but I was a ball of nerves and carrying the broken glass of a breakup in my shoes.

1o8h8ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialWorkStudents/comments/1o8h8ef/what_to_prioritize_on_my_grad_school_resume/,What to prioritize on my grad school resume?,"Hi all! I’m applying to a bunch of MSW programs this cycle for Fall ‘26 and I’m struggling to figure out what to prioritize on my resume. This is a huge career switch for me and most of my social work related experience is in a voluntary role. I’m currently a graphic designer in manufacturing and managed a specialty coffee shop for a few years prior to that.

My experience with the public spans three places:

1. I developed curriculum and taught art lessons at a women’s correctional facility for 8 hours a week during college - this was the experience that single-handedly changed my career aspirations and I should have a letter of rec from the professor that supervised me during this so I definitely want to include it.

2. I spend about 2 hours a week serving our unhoused neighbors on Skid Row through a non-profit. This is the longest-running experience I have as I’ve been doing it for a little over 3 years now. 

3. Two full summers working as a program coordinator and counselor for a summer camp that served an extremely wide range of students, most of my experience being with high schoolers on scholarship. Need to be able to describe the one-on-one mentorship and guidance I was lucky to provide to those kids. I will have a letter from my supervisor here as well.

I don’t want to discredit my current job but I’m unsure if not working in the field will affect my ability to get into a Cal State (I know they’re competitive) so if anyone has any ideas on how to frame some of this stuff appropriately I would love to hear some thoughts!

I have a BA in Art Education and my last 60 units put me at around a 3.75 GPA.

Would love to hear from students at any of the CSUs as well! I’m excited to start the process but super apprehensive.",1,1760646280.0,SocialWorkStudents,2,1.0,False

Hi everyone, first post in this sub as I'm not sure what to do. I've just vomited at work twice and it did look like coffee grounds and I already know that's initially pretty bad, but I drank a small bit off coffee today and had nothing else so I'm afraid if I jump the gun on this one I'll look silly as I've probably just thrown up what I drank. I did cough up a little bit of bright red blood though, so that's what is giving me the second thought. I've been feeling very nauseous lately, haven't been able to use the restroom very well for months (I've been taking laxatives every few days for a while now, no in-person doctors have been of help unfortunately.) And I'm worried maybe the laxative abuse has caused some internal bleeding? Is that even a thing? Please some advice. Thank you for reading.",1,1760645630.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

My concern with going totally LVP is that my kitties currently scratch and sharpen their claws on the carpet, and once that's gone, what do they do?  One uses a scratcher from time to time that has the corrugated insert.  I also have a hemp rope scratcher that I laid on its side, but I don't think either one of them uses that.  At least I never see it.

I plan to put large area rugs in the living room/den area under the coffee table and also in the master bedroom under the bed.  That might give them the scratching satisfaction...hopefully.

To that end, what is the consensus for what to get so my kitties can do their scratching and claw sharpening and be happy in the adjustment without carpet??  I was thinking about a carpeted cat tree/tower, but will have to figure out where to put it...space is a little limited.

1o8gvmk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8gvmk,Violent murder of 13-year-old Vasilisa Faizova,"
**Reposting with no video this time. My sincere apologies to everyone. I only wanted to bring this case to light and hopefully help share Vasilisa’s legacy**


*That’s the one case that ripped my heart in two and just stuck with me. This lovely young girl touched my heart in so many ways and not a day goes by that I don’t think about her. She made the world a much better place just by being in it and never deserved the terrible death she endured.*


Vasilisa Faizova was born in July 2009 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. She came into the world in a wonderfully loving family: Vasilisa had an older sister, Alisa, one year her senior, and a set of caring parents. Her mother, Olesya, is a talented fashion designer and seamstress who is pretty recognized in Russia. 


Ever since Vasilisa was little, it seemed that she took after her mom: little girl showed extraordinary talent in pretty much every field of arts. She had a truly beautiful singing voice and sang in a vocal studio since she was little, winning many awards and competitions. She taught herself to play the keyboard, guitar and ukulele. She drew and painted, sewed and knitted, surprising her many friends with beautifully made pieces. About a year before her tragic death, Vasilisa took a great interest in creating collages using magazine cutouts, and even held creative master classes for others in cozy coffee houses of her hometown. People of all ages and walks of life attended these creative meetings and absolutely loved Vasilisa’s creativity as well as her kind and friendly personality.


Vasilisa grew up in an atmosphere of love and kindness, and she enjoyed a beautiful relationship with both of her parents, her sister, and her grandparents. The family was very close knit and loved spending time together, especially at their countryside home. Not too long before Vasilisa’s life was taken, her father, and later grandfather, passed away. That time was very difficult for the family, and everyone was grieving. One thing remained unchanged: the remaining members of the family all supported each other and their bond grew even stronger as they were mourning their loss. 


Little did they know they’d soon have to grieve their beloved Vasya, as Vasilisa was lovingly called at home.


It’s important to note that everyone who knew Vasilisa also knew what a kind, loving soul she was. Vasilisa was very friendly and loved people with her whole heart. She’d always go above and beyond for others.


About a year or so before her death, Vasilisa made a new friend. It was a young boy named Ilya, aged 16, who preferred to be called Demyan. Demyan was quite a whimsical character; he loved to stand out from the crowd. He was known to be artistic and gifted in several areas. Vasilisa and Demyan had quite a bit in common: both loved to read, both enjoyed fine arts. Despite the age gap which can feel substantial when you’re in your teens, they were fast friends, and would often chat online about things like books or animes they both loved. Demyan was really big on acting: he participated in a theater studio. Olesya, Vasilisa’s mom, would often notice that her daughter would talk about her new friend all the time. She was not worried, though: she knew Vasilisa trusted her immensely and would come to her with anything. It seemed as if nothing was concerning about this friendship.


Little is known about Demyan’s background, but we do know he comes from a full, loving family. He was an only child and loved by his parents. When the boy was about 12, though, he confided to his mother that he felt an immense hatred for people. The worried mother took him to a child psychiatrist, and he was later put on medication. Demyan kept a journal, which would be found and read later. The journal contained detailed descriptions of his hatred for those around him and of his desire to kill others. Demyan wrote that he was never himself around other people, wearing a thousand different masks. He even went so far as to call himself a king of all hypocrites. 


Demyan had another female friend, a 15-year-old Anfisa. Anfisa was a gifted honor roll student, and was known to enjoy filming. She wanted to be a director and videographer in the future, and was quite popular with her peers. 


On April 30, 2023, Demyan and Anfisa asked Vasilisa if she would help them with a creative project. The project was about interviews with different young people, and Demyan claimed that Vasilisa would be their star guest. Unsuspecting, the young girl gladly accepted. The interview was meant to take place during a picnic in a remote area near Saint Petersburg. Vasilisa was excited to participate, and even got a whole new outfit beforehand. She trusted and looked up to Demyan and Anfisa so much, she would never even imagine they would hurt her.


Demyan asked Vasilisa a few questions, one of which was “What would you say to your loved ones if you knew you were about to die”. Vasilisa looked straight at the camera and said, *I would just give them all a big hug.*


Tragically, she would never get a chance to do that. 


While she was smiling at the camera, Demyan crept up to her from behind and started slamming Vasilisa with a hammer. The blows were so intense and so shocking, the girl fell to the ground and died within only about 20 seconds. Despite that, Demyan kept viciously attacking her body, as Anfisa was calmly filming the murder and encouraging her friend, saying “Go ahead, don’t stop”.


The teenagers then inspected Vasilisa backpack, stealing some of her possessions like a face cleanser, some money (about $10) and a powerbank. Demyan even grabbed Vasilisa’s phone to message her mom, saying “Thank you for everything, mother. I won’t be coming back home. I long to see new places and meet new people”. He then smashed the phone and threw it out. 


His cruelty did not stop there, though. He snapped a few pictures of Vasilisa’s battered body and anonymously sent them to her sister Alisa, to gloat over the tragedy. They then proceeded to wrap the body in a plastic bag and fled the scene. It’s chilling that after this heinous act, both Demyan and Anfisa just went about their business as usual, like nothing had happened. They ate out at their favorite place, walked around the city a bit, and then both went to their respective homes.


Meanwhile, Vasilisa’s family was living a nightmare. That’s how her mother later described what it was like: like life turned into a nightmare she couldnt wake up from. Each day following the murder was, and is, absolutely harrowing. Alisa, Vasilisa’s sister, was so traumatized by the ordeal that she barely talked to anyone for the following two years. 


Nothing would ever be the same again.


The young murderers were caught within the next several days. Their families hired expensive, high end lawyers, and the public was shocked and disgusted: Demyan and Anfisa were sentenced to only 7 and 6 years in the juvie respectively. As the court psychiatrist said, the fact that the two filmed the murder and how calm and reserved their demeanor on film was, means that they were deeply enjoying their actions and were unlikely to stop or change. 


I personally find this sentence disturbing and heartbreaking. They killed an innocent, trusting young girl and only got this laughable sentence. They not only killed Vasilisa, they also destroyed her family and the lives of all those who loved her. Their own souls were so dark that the light Vasilisa was shining on this world disturbed them beyond words. They couldn’t shine themselves, so they chose to destroy the light that was shining so brightly. But, they were wrong.


**Vasilisa’s light will never go out**


During her short time on earth and even after she was gone, Vasilisa touched so many souls with her kindness. She will always be remembered. She will always be loved. ",134,1760645483.0,TrueCrimeDiscussion,11,0.97,False

1o8guwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/1800Drama/comments/1o8guwm/would_i_be_the_drama_for_telling_my_bestfriend/,Would I be the drama for telling my bestfriend our friendship feels off?,"Dear fellow peaches,
I am feeling very conflicted about my friendship with my bestfriend, we will call her A. We are both 20 years old, both female and have known each other for the entire duration of highschool. We were in the same friend group consisting of 7 girls of which 5 of them are still in contact although one friend is not really part of the group anymore. This is friend B. 

As a bit of backstory: 
Our group has always consisted of pairs: two friends that especially got along. Out pairs were A & B, C & D, me & E, and F, who was never truly close with anyone. 
At one point me and E had a fall out and, A and B had a fall out shortly after. A and I became a new pair. 

This will become relevant later. 

We are now fresh out of highschool and have started uni and working.
Right before the summer, me and my girlfriend broke up and it was a hot mess. 
I won't go into detail but to summarize there was a lot of on and off, a new girl she was dating, along with love confessions and a lot of confusing texts. 

I broke off contact 2 weeks ago because I couldn't handle it anymore. I was and still am feeling absolutely wrecked. 

About a month ago my ex kissed me out of the blue and I felt horrible after. I called A that night because I was so panicked. She coached me through it then asked me if there was anything she could do to help. I told her that I would love it if we could hang out eat cookies, watch movies and cry our eyes out. She was also going through it with her grandpa passing away a few weeks before so I knew she needed it as much as she did. 

This hangout was last friday. 
We bakked cinammon roles, watched a movie from the early 2000s and had a great time. The part I was most looking forward to though was talking about everything. I tried to get a conversation going and check in on her throughout the day but everytime she would redirect it. 
Around 11pm she asked if we could call it a night and walked me to my car. 
Before I got in I told her that I would still appreciate it if we could talk some day because everything is still bothering me.
I explained that ofcourse I understood that I had talked about it a lot lately and that I hoped it wasn't bothering her. She told me she prefered me talking to her rather than bottling it up and proposed we meet for coffee on friday. She hasn't texted me since. Which isn't unusual but does indicate that coffee isn't happening. 

Since then something doesn't feel right to me. I feel like I always have to announce myself like this when I want to talk about my feelings and while she always agrees on listening it feels reluctant. I also feel like she doesn't ask about major things in my life even if she knows it bothers me. An example for this is when my ex showed up with her new girl at the bar we were bartending at. Eventhough I was shaking and on the verge of tears for the entire rest of our shift she didn't ask, didn't care until I startet crying at the trainstation.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore because I feel like I can't keep on asking her to care. I feel like she sometimes is bothered by things I say and do but will never say it to my face. I feel like I always need to tone my personality down. I don't know whether this is my anxiety or the reality. 

Sometimes especially if we meet with B, I feel like a third wheel and I have the slight suspicion that I might be only a place holder until their friendship is better again. 

I don't know if I am overreacting. I am scared to talk to her about it because I don't wanna risk what we have built over the last year. We are going to new zealand together next year (a trip that originally A & B wanted to do) and I don't wanna risk it.

I don't know what to do. Am I being dramatic? Would I be the drama for telling her how I feel? How do I resolve this tactfully? 

Please give your honest view and as well as how you would handle the situation. 

If anyone has tips on how to get over a breakup that would also be much appreciated. 

Thank you all so so much!
