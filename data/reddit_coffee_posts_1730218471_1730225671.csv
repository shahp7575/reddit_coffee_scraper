","So I went to Assiniboine park yesterday at 12:30 pm with the baby. He napped and i walked around, exercising. I’m walking in the Leo Mol garden then notice someone behind. Turn, it’s just a man. Then I go behind the garden and next to the river. The same man follows me. Starts talking to me, about my baby and how he has an 11 year old and how kids are great. I’m like yep (please don’t murder me). He could definitely beat me up. He talks about the weather, then asks me if I’m Ukrainian. Then tells me I look intelligent. After a few minutes the road splits and he asks if he could invite me for a cup of coffee. I’m like no thank you. He’s like you sure? I smile, say I’m sure and have a good day.

Honestly, I felt very scared and uncomfortable the whole time. But I kept telling myself it’s just a man wanting to ask a woman out, he was nice and respected the no. But then I sent the message to a group chat with other moms and they said they had a similar experience with what sounds like the same man. Apparently he approached the group of them and wanted to see their babies. 

Taller white man, mid to late 40s. Has a truck and talks about his 11 year old. Anyone else experience something like this?",1,1730225584.0,Winnipeg,0,1.0,False

  Still no sign of the 95 missing after the Halloween incident.  
  Also, whoever is censoring my logs at the office, I will find you and I will #$;&# $$%&^# your #&^#^$& off, and s#$@ down your ##$%#*& neck till you $&$^#^% choke.

  Things have gotten weirder than usual ever since that night. On the 2nd of November, I woke up to banging on my apartment door.  Put my jocks on and answered it, tired as s###, and there was this f#$##@$ white rabbit in a f$%##$% fancy coat right there. Except the door didn't open to my apartment floor, it opened to a literal forest of giant f#$#-off mushrooms!
  So I think I'm dreaming, and the rabbit says ""No, you're not. Do you mind if I come in?"" Obviously, I tell him to f#ck off, and go back to Wonderland so that I can sleep! The rabbit takes out this gold pocket-watch, and tells me ""Look, I've got a hundred-thousand more Changed to get to, and I'm already running late.  It'll only be a few minutes...or hours, really time is more like a Rollercoaster within a circle, not so much a line-""

  I decide to grab the little f#cker by the neck and throw him out.  Then I realize I'm not in my room anymore and I'm the one being thrown out.  Pretty sure I was passing myself with how high I was falling; the trees of mushrooms began to lengthen and shrink as I fell for what felt like minutes before my apartment door appeared into thin-air as I fell back into my room, crashing into my living-room.
  There he was: the damn bunny in my recliner, with a brewed pot of tea and China cups. 
""Oh, you're back. I really should have mentioned that touching a being inbetween reality and the Hedge can be a hit of a Rollercoaster, so to speak.  Now that you've calmed down, maybe we can chat. I brewed us some chamomile.""

  Long-story short, the White Rabbit was some sort of messenger/travel-agent figure within the Hedge, and he gave me the run-down of what to expect as a Changeling, and where to go if I want to find the Courtlands.  Honestly, I couldn't follow most of it, probably 'cause he spoke in riddles most of the time...and I was scared sh#tless. Before I knew it, he looked at his watch and hurried out my door. The tea was actually pretty good.

[b]November 12th, 2024[b]

  I think I just might be a bit more f#cking pissed off than usual. I mean, usually I can control my temper pretty well, at least in public, but whatever that c### witch did to me is messing me up.  I tried showering the green off my skin, but it doesn't do anything.  The costume is off, but I still have these stitches, I still look like the f@#$#@^ hulk, and nobody seems to notice!
  Speaking of stitches, that's another thing: my arm just fell off the other day. Literally fell off while I was chatting up Rachel at HQ on our coffee break. 
  How the f#ck am I suppose to screw the brains out of my hook-ups if there's a chance my f#cking dick is gonna fall off?! The weird thing is I could still control my arm; it takes some effort, but I can move it around with...phantom whats-its? Some weird magic s#$#.

  The Agency has been briefing me on my new condition, at least what they know.  This Summer Court thing is some kind of place I belong to within the Hedge; a lot of warriors come from that place, at least I think so? Anyway, the Boss told me I needed to take some time off and check out this Hedge place...After that F#CKING RABBIT, I'm not sure that's a great idea, but orders are orders.

  F#ck, my wrist fell off again.

1gf1a6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gf1a6h/i_am_suspicious_of_my_wife_and_friends_behaviour/,I am suspicious of my wife and friend’s behaviour. I want to check her phone. AITAH?,"Hi, I am the OP who posted this story a few weeks ago. You guys helped me so much during a really rough time, so I felt compelled to return and share what’s been happening with you guys. I had to create a new account to do so, as I no longer have access to my previous one. Update summary: I found a heck of a lawyer, divorce papers were drafted and I filed yesterday morning, and I told the OBS.

Before I get into the updates, here is the original post (scroll to Update 5 if you’re familiar with the story and want to read the most recent update):



My wife (30F) and I (32M) just returned from a long weekend camping trip with two other couples, friends we’ve known for years. We had a great time, but something happened the morning we left that I can’t shake.

We were all packing up, getting ready to head back home. I was loading our car, when I looked up and saw my wife and my friend. There were at the campsite, several feet away. She was bent over to pick something up, and in that split second, I saw him reach out and squeeze her hip, sliding his hand down to her ass. My wife quickly pushed his hand away, but she didn’t look upset. She was smiling at him - almost playfully(?) It all happened so fast, maybe a second or two, but it felt like I’d been punched in the stomach. I glanced around, but no one else seemed to have seen it. His wife was busy packing up their car, and the other couple was further away, chatting about the ride back. 

The drive home was quiet. My wife tried making conversation, but I couldn’t focus. My mind kept replaying that scene over and over. When she asked why I was so quiet, I lied and said I was just thinking about work. The truth is, I was in shock. I didn’t want to bring it up. If I mentioned it, she might tell me I was imagining things, that I was being ridiculous. The rest of the day I felt like I was just moving on autopilot. I barely slept last night and can hardly focus at work today. My mind keeps racing, questioning every detail. Aside from what I saw, the rest of the trip was great and nothing seemed out of place. A part of me is wondering if read the whole situation wrong. But, the look on her face, that smile—it was too friendly, too casual for something that crossed a line like that.

I love my wife to death. We’ve been together since freshman year of college, and I’ve never had reason to doubt her. She’s my best friend. But now, for the first time, there’s this knot in my gut that I can’t untangle. I’ve never been the type to snoop. I’ve always trusted her completely. But right now, I’m sitting here, wondering if I should check her phone. It's password protected, so even if I wanted to, I don’t know how I’d do it without her finding out. This is eating me up and I know I need to do something about it. 

WIBTAH to go through her phone? And even if I wanted to, how can I if it is password protected?



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



Found her iPAD - it didn’t have a password, so I got in and it is still connected to her phone. She has Telegram on it. They’ve been chatting on there. I am still going through the messages, but she is cheating. I am not falling apart yet, I’m trying to keep it together to make the correct next move without fucking this up. What do I do? Do I confront her when she gets home? Do I go to his house and confront him? Please help. 



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE 2\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



Thank you all for your advice. I didn't tell her anything. I have locked myself up in my home office under the pretence of needing to catch up on work. She is not suspicious. I kept the IPad with me, she hasn't used in so long she won't even know it's missing. I took pictures of all their messages using my phone as a safety measure as well. They have been chatting for at last 8 months as far as I can tell. Telegram is their main communication channel it seems. They've sent each other nudes, sex messages, and making plans on making their relationship official after leaving me and his wife. I can't believe she would do this to me. From the messages, I saw she had sent him a sexy suggestive photo of herself on her way to the gym earlier this evening, and when she got back home, she started kissing me, wanting sex. I declined saying I needed to get work done. 



I am confused right now and unable to think clearly, so I will follow the advice I am offered here: lawyer, gather evidence. I will work on those. I also saw several comments advising me to separate my finances from hers. We co-own the apartment we live in, and have joint bank accounts. My parents died in a car crash 2 years ago and left me a large inheritance, which she knows about. She does not have access to the money in that fund, is there anything I need to do to protect myself there if it comes to that point?



We don't have kids yet.





\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE 3\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



I work from home sometimes and didn’t have any meetings this morning, so I spent it researching and calling lawyers. I have two consultations lined up for tomorrow, but the majority couldn’t book me in until next week. 



I will tell his wife and show her proof as soon as I settle on a lawyer and get myself covered first. Once she’s been informed, I will give her time to get her affairs in order and secure a lawyer if that’s what she wants to do before I decide what to do next, such as confronting my wife. 



I don’t understand how I’m feeling. I am not angry for some reason. More numb maybe. Sick and nauseous when I think of the messages I’ve read, especially the sex messages. I just feel like I am just doing the things that I need to be doing right now, but it’s almost like I am living somebody else’s life. I don’t know how long I can keep up the poker face without her noticing something is up.



Thanks for your messages and support. 



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE 4\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



Guys, I am humbled by all the messages and advice I received. Not much has happened since yesterday. Just keeping myself busy with work and the gym. The anniversary of my parents passing is coming up in about a month and she obviously knows this so when she asked why I seemed off, I just told her I was thinking about them. I have consultations with several lawyers lined up - most next week, a few this afternoon. I will update after I settle on a lawyer and know what my options are.





\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE 5\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



I found a hell of a lawyer who managed to draft my divorce papers within days, which were filed this morning. I am in a no-fault jurisdiction, which meant all the evidence of the infidelity which I had gathered, can’t be used in court. The good news is that my inheritance is safe because I didn’t use the money for marital expenses. Our condo was a wedding gift, bought by both our parents (each side contributed 50% to the down payment) so one of us will have to buy the other out or we both sell it. 



I called the OBS on Saturday and asked to meet her for coffee. I chose that day because, ironically, her husband and my wife had gone on an overnight trip together. I found out from their messages on the iPad. The lies they were going with were: my wife was staying at her sister’s for the weekend to help with the kids while her sister’s husband was away on a business trip and her husband was going away for a work-related project. The truth was, my wife and my husband were taking a trip out of town together and were staying at a hotel, all paid for by the Casanova himself. I showed her their messages on the Telegram app, pictures included, all of it. She told me she noticed him feeling distant and withdrawn a few months ago, she thought it was just work stress and had no reason to suspect he was cheating. Finding out that her husband was in fact cheating, and with my wife, who is also HER friend, came as a blow to her. We chatted some more and I gave her my lawyer’s number as she considers her options. 



Sunday night, my wife returned from her “sister’s house”. She walked through the door and greeted me with kisses, saying she missed me.. after she had spent the weekend with her lover. Her ability to compartmentalize is almost diabolical. I sat her down and told her we needed to talk. I had the whole conversation recorded without her knowledge (following lawyer’s advice, I live in a one-party consent state). Here’s how it went:



I asked her to promise to be honest with me (“of course, baby” but she was nervous). Then I asked her a series of questions, do you love me? (“Yes”), are you happy with me? (“Yes, of course, baby”), have I been a good husband to you? Do I treat you right? (“Yes and yes. Wth is going on?”). Please humour me (“okay”). Have I ever done anything to hurt you, whether physically or emotionally? (“No, of course not. Wtf”), Okay.. so, if you’re happy with me, then why are you cheating on me? She stared at me in shock for a good minute and then immediately started denying it. This went on for a little while and then I just told her to drop the act because I found out the truth. Eventually, she broke down and admitted to kissing a guy who had been hitting on her at a bar during a night out with her girlfriend a few months ago. I don’t know why but at this point I started laughing because the whole thing was just absurd. She not only cheated on me, she had taken every opportunity she could find to cheat on me. I asked her if that was the only time she cheated. She swore up and down that it was the only time and that it was a moment of weakness, that she was drunk, and it had meant nothing. 



I said nothing, I gave her my lawyer’s business card and said I filed for divorce (I hadn’t yet, I wanted to talk to her just once first to see if there was anything left of our marriage to salvage) and that if she wanted to reach me she should call my lawyer. She cried, begged, apologised and then when I started packing a suitcase, she shifted to gaslighting me, saying I was throwing away everything we had over a mistake. And the worst part of what she said was I had no one else in the world, why would I leave the only family I had left. This stung because I told her she was my only remaining family after my parents died and there was no one else I could depend on. Only for her to throw those very words back in my face. I left that night to a hotel where I am staying until I find a new apartment. Yesterday, I officially filed for divorce.

Unlike traditional diets, a gut health-centered approach doesn’t just address calorie intake but rather focuses on nurturing beneficial bacteria in the digestive system. These microbes help regulate metabolism, fight inflammation, and enhance digestion, creating a foundation for effective and sustainable weight management. This guide brings together proven strategies to support gut health while promoting weight loss, addressing key factors that lead to healthier living inside and out.

One essential aspect of this approach is understanding the link between gut health and immune system function. Studies reveal that the diversity of gut bacteria can significantly impact immunity and inflammation levels. A diet rich in fiber, antioxidants, and healthy fats provides nutrients that support microbial diversity, leading to better immune responses and less systemic inflammation. High-fiber foods like vegetables and whole grains act as prebiotics, which are nutrients that feed healthy gut bacteria, while antioxidants help protect cells and tissues from oxidative stress, supporting a healthier immune system.

When aiming to lose weight, a balanced diet alone isn’t enough—supporting the body’s natural fat-burning mechanisms through specific foods is also crucial. Certain foods, such as healthy fats from sources like nuts and avocados, aid in thermogenesis, the body's process of generating heat and burning calories. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish or flaxseeds, for instance, have been shown to balance metabolism, while polyphenols in green tea can support fat oxidation. By incorporating these “fat-burning” foods into meals, individuals can maximize the body’s ability to shed pounds while nourishing gut bacteria.

Avoiding processed foods that disrupt gut health is equally important for weight loss. Many processed snacks, refined sugars, and artificial sweeteners can harm beneficial bacteria, leading to sugar cravings and inflammation, both of which hinder weight loss. Instead, reaching for nutrient-dense whole foods can curb these cravings naturally. Additionally, probiotics from foods like yogurt or kimchi introduce beneficial bacteria directly into the gut, improving digestion and enhancing the body's capacity for sustained energy and balanced cravings.

A gut health-focused weight loss plan addresses more than just calories—it optimizes the entire digestive ecosystem for better metabolism, reduced inflammation, and improved immunity. By choosing foods that support both gut health and fat metabolism, you pave the way for a healthier body and mind. This guide equips you with the tools to make smart dietary decisions that not only lead to weight loss but also promote overall wellness and a balanced lifestyle. Embracing a gut health approach to weight loss can be the most effective way to achieve lasting results and a body that thrives.

# Gut Health and Weight Loss Guide: Debunking Common Myths and Embracing Health

**Navigating the world of gut health and weight loss can be challenging, with countless myths, trends, and conflicting advice circulating everywhere. Many people feel pressured to purchase supplements, adopt restrictive diets, or follow the latest weight loss fads. However, achieving optimal health doesn’t have to be overly complicated. This guide explores and debunks common health myths so you can focus on simple, effective choices to improve both your gut health and weight loss journey.**

[Gut Health and Weight Loss Guide: Debunking Common Myths and Embracing Health](https://preview.redd.it/6o3wbpzciqxd1.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=796a35e5d359f972815f712130fefc489ff8a6ab)

# Myth 1: “Carbs Make You Fat”

Contrary to popular belief, carbohydrates alone do not cause weight gain. Many nutrient-dense carbs, like sweet potatoes, quinoa, broccoli, and whole grains, provide essential nutrients and energy. The issue arises when high-calorie, low-nutrient carbs, such as processed pasta or sugary drinks, are consumed in excess. Weight gain typically results from consuming more calories than your body needs, regardless of whether those calories come from carbs, fats, or proteins.

# Myth 2: “Sugar-Free and Fat-Free Foods Are Healthier”

The labels “sugar-free” and “fat-free” are often used as marketing strategies. In reality, many sugar-free products are loaded with artificial sweeteners, and fat-free items may contain added sugars or artificial fillers to compensate for the lost flavor. Instead, focus on whole, minimally processed foods that contain natural sugars and fats, as these are often easier for your body to process.

# Myth 3: “Coffee Is Unhealthy”

A daily dose of coffee can actually offer numerous health benefits, including antioxidants that fight free radicals in the body. The problem arises with highly sweetened and processed coffee drinks from popular cafes. Black coffee, or coffee with a splash of natural, unsweetened cream, is a great choice for most people and can be part of a balanced, health-focused diet.

# Myth 4: “Juice Cleanses Are Great for Detox”

Your body is naturally equipped to detoxify itself, thanks to organs like the liver, kidneys, and spleen. A juice cleanse, which is typically high in sugar and lacks fiber, can place extra strain on these organs rather than providing a true detox. Instead, a balanced diet with whole fruits, vegetables, and plenty of water supports your body’s natural detoxification processes.

# Myth 5: “Fresh Produce Is Healthier Than Frozen Produce”

Frozen fruits and vegetables can be just as nutritious, if not more so, than their fresh counterparts. Frozen produce is picked at its peak ripeness and immediately flash-frozen, preserving its nutritional value. Fresh produce may spend time in transit and on store shelves, losing nutrients. Opting for frozen produce can help prevent waste, as it lasts longer and can be used whenever needed.

# Myth 6: “Red Meat Is Bad for You”

Red meat, when consumed in moderation, offers essential nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, and zinc. Recent studies suggest that saturated fats from natural sources, like grass-fed beef, do not have as strong a link to heart disease as previously thought. Choosing lean cuts and pairing red meat with plenty of vegetables can make it part of a balanced diet.

# Myth 7: “Gluten-Free Foods Are Always Better for You”

Unless you have a diagnosed gluten intolerance or celiac disease, gluten-free foods are not inherently healthier. Whole grains like wheat, barley, and rye contain valuable fiber and nutrients essential for gut health. Opting for gluten-free products without a specific medical reason may result in a diet that is lower in fiber and higher in processed ingredients.

# Myth 8: “All Carbonated Drinks Are Unhealthy”

Not all carbonated beverages are created equal. While sodas and sugary carbonated drinks contain artificial flavors and sugars, plain sparkling water is a great alternative to stay hydrated without adding sugar or calories. Sparkling water offers the same hydration benefits as still water, making it a healthy, refreshing choice.

# Myth 9: “Margarine Is Healthier Than Butter”

Butter, particularly when grass-fed and organic, provides healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. Margarine, on the other hand, contains trans fats that are linked to heart disease and inflammation. If you avoid animal products, consider alternatives like coconut oil, which is rich in healthy saturated fats.

# Myth 10: “Eggs Are Unhealthy Because of Their Cholesterol Content”

Eggs are nutrient-dense, providing high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals. While they do contain cholesterol, studies have shown that dietary cholesterol doesn’t necessarily raise blood cholesterol levels in most people.

Looking for a new lip color that's both long-lasting and comfortable? I recently tried the NARS Velvet Lip Glide in Unspeakable, and I think it might be just what you're after.

This lip color gives intense pigmentation with a semi-matte finish that looks great. I really like how it feels on my lips - it's not drying at all. The formula has water lily flowers and white tea extract, which provide some nice antioxidant benefits too.

https://preview.redd.it/z9f46dpegqxd1.jpg?width=415&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f35bd047b732e79bef563383720a9e1862a21905

When I put it on, the color goes on smoothly and evenly. It's not sticky or goopy at all. The shade Unspeakable is a beautiful deep red that works for many skin tones. I find it lasts for several hours before I need to reapply.

One thing to note - it's not completely transfer-proof. You might see some color come off on cups or straws. But the trade-off is that it feels more comfortable than super matte, totally budge-proof formulas.

# Bottom Line

If you want a lip color that's pigmented, comfy, and long-lasting, give the NARS Velvet Lip Glide a try. The color payoff and feel on the lips make it worth checking out.



# Overview of NARS Velvet Lip Glide - Unspeakable

I recently tried this lip color and was impressed by its performance. The semi-matte finish looks great and stays put for hours. I like that it doesn't dry out my lips like some long-lasting formulas can.

The color payoff is intense, giving my lips a bold look with just one swipe. It feels smooth and comfortable to wear. I noticed the hydrating effect, which I guess comes from the water lily flowers and white tea extract.

While I love the color and feel, it can be a bit tricky to apply evenly at first. It took me a few tries to get the hang of it. The packaging is sleek and fits nicely in my makeup bag.

For anyone wanting a long-lasting lip color that won't leave your lips feeling parched, this NARS lip glide is worth checking out. Just be ready to practice your application technique a bit.

# Semi Matte Finish

The Velvet Lip Glide's semi matte finish is a standout feature. I found it strikes a nice balance between bold color and a subtle sheen. It's not fully matte, which helps it avoid the dry, cakey look some matte lipsticks can have. The finish gives my lips a smooth, polished appearance without looking flat or lifeless. It feels comfortable and doesn't emphasize lip lines or dry patches. The color stays put well throughout the day, though I did need to touch up after eating. While not as long-lasting as some ultra-matte formulas, I think the trade-off in comfort is worth it. The semi matte finish works for both day and night looks, making this a versatile lip product.

# Hydration and Antioxidant Protection

I was impressed by how comfortable this lip glide felt on my lips. The formula packs a punch with water lily flowers and white tea extract. These ingredients kept my lips feeling soft and hydrated all day. I didn't experience any dryness or flaking, which can be common with long-lasting lip colors. The antioxidants in the white tea extract are a nice bonus, potentially helping protect my lips from environmental damage. I appreciated that NARS included these beneficial ingredients without compromising on color payoff or wear time. My lips felt nourished and looked great, even after hours of wear.

# All-Skin-Type Suitability

I found this lip glide works well for different skin types. The formula feels light and isn't drying, which is great for people with dry or sensitive lips. It glides on smoothly without tugging. The water lily and white tea ingredients seem to help keep lips soft. I noticed it didn't irritate my lips or cause any reactions. The semi-matte finish looks nice on various skin tones too. While it's not totally transfer-proof, it does last a decent amount of time before needing touch-ups. Overall, this NARS lip product seems suitable for most people to try out.

# Ease of Application

I found the Velvet lip glide super easy to put on. The wand applicator glides smoothly across my lips, letting me apply it quickly and neatly. It's not too runny or too thick, so I don't have to worry about it dripping or clumping. The formula spreads evenly without much effort. I like that I can build up the color gradually for a more intense look if I want. It doesn't dry out my lips or feel sticky. The slim tube is easy to hold and fits nicely in my makeup bag. Overall, applying this lip product is a breeze - even when I'm in a rush.

# Pros and Cons

The Velvet Lip Glide caught my eye, and I couldn't wait to try it out. After using it for a while, I've noticed some standout features and a few drawbacks.

# Pros

* The semi-matte finish looks great and feels comfortable on my lips.
* I love that it has water lily flowers and white tea extract. These ingredients make my lips feel hydrated.
* The color payoff is impressive. It goes on smooth and even.
* The packaging is sleek and easy to carry in my makeup bag.

# Cons

* It's not transfer-proof. I noticed it left marks on my coffee cup.
* The color can be a bit intense for everyday wear. I have to apply it carefully.
* Some shades might look different on the lips than in the tube.
* It's pricier than drugstore options, which might not fit everyone's budget.

While I enjoy using this lip product, it's not perfect. The hydrating formula and beautiful finish make it a nice addition to my makeup collection. But the transfer issue and bold color mean it might not be the best choice for a long day at work or a meal out.

# Authentic Customer Reviews

I tried the Velvet Lip Glide and found it to be a mixed bag. Many users love the color and consistency, praising its velvety feel on the lips. The red shade is often described as flattering. I noticed it lasts quite a while, which is a plus. But there are some downsides. It's not transfer-proof, so it can smudge and stain teeth. Some folks aren't fans of how it tastes or feels. The color might look different on different skin tones - one person said it looked like clay on their lips. Overall, opinions vary. With a 4.2-star rating from 165 reviews, most seem happy with their purchase. But it's not perfect for everyone.

# Conclusion

The Velvet Lip Glide is a solid choice for lip color fans. I liked its smooth texture and how it felt on my lips. The shade looked nice, but it did transfer a bit. It lasted pretty well through the day. While not perfect, it's a good option for those who want a lip product that's between a gloss and a lipstick. I'd say it's worth trying if you're into NARS products or looking for something new. Just keep in mind it may not be totally transfer-proof. All in all, I found it to be a decent lip product that I'll keep using.",1,1730224051.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

I lost weight and I noticed that my lipoma’s were shrinking too. I was always told that you could never get rid of your lipoma’s no matter how much weight you lose they don’t shrink. But mine are now… lightbulbs went off in my head when I saw a commercial for some sort of mushroom blend for dogs. Their main focus is shrinking the lipomas in dogs. (mind blown.)

And it does go somewhere. We store this fear, resentment, trauma, existential angst, and dissatisfaction in our body. You want to feel truly free? Sit with your true emotions, introduce yourself. Learn how to accept and eventually even appreciate all sides of you.

2. Tell your friends you’re going to go a month sober.
There was a group of four of us who decided on November 1st we were going to quit everything and do a dopamine detox. They didn’t know the true extent of my detox until months later, but the group support was incredibly helpful. Guys, I’m telling you—find an enemy in your life that you can fight while you detox from Feel Free. Don’t make it about quitting Feel Free. Make it about changing your brain chemistry. Nicotine, coffee, junk food, go keto, masturbation/porn, whatever. I did a juice fast for 10 days. Doing this allowed me to focus on something beyond, “If I just had one Feel Free, I would feel better.” The threshold became so much lower for dopamine. The thought of steak was my true craving. I would journal each day, listen to music. I was getting hyped on the idea of altering my brain chemistry to create better habits. A month later, I did not have a single urge to take a Feel Free or Kratom. In fact, I couldn’t even imagine being the kind of person who would drink eight shots a day of anything.

3. I promise you will feel better if you go outside.
I decided to spend as much time outside as I could. Walking on the grass barefoot. Laying in the sun. Working remotely from the park. Jumping in cold water every morning to start the day. Outside became my new drug. Need a pick-me-up? Go outside. Feeling restless? Go for a walk. Feeling angry? Go for a sloppy jog.

4. Make the sauna & cold plunge your best friends.
This one may sound like a luxury for some. There’s a studio in my city I paid $170 (or three days of Feel Frees) for a membership. Did you know the cold plunge raises dopamine over 250% for six hours? It’s the best high on the market. And knowing each sauna session was detoxing me more and more became so addictive. Best part? All you have to do is sit there. I don’t care how bad you feel; I promise you can sit in a sauna and be pissed. You will feel better after a sauna & cold plunge session.

5. You must surrender.
You can call it God, or the universe, the barista you want to impress, your higher self, or even the trees outside. You must recognize that you are abandoning your will. You are not strong enough to do this on your own without divine intervention. You must have something beyond you that you are orienting to in order to achieve something that you are not. Lay at the altar and sacrifice your way of doing things. Pick up your cross and carry it. I’m not religious, but during my quit, I found myself repeating this mantra from Catholic Mass I remembered as a kid: “God, I am not worthy to receive you but only say the word, and my soul shall be healed.”

A year later, and it may seem impossible, but I truly do not think about these at all. Every so often, my girlfriend and I will joke about it just because of how outlandish it seems I would spend thousands of dollars on these blue bottles. I didn’t get deceived by a podcast; I knew what kratom was. I decided that I wouldn’t be a victim to decisions I made and continued to make on my own.

At the end of the day, you’re borrowing from tomorrow. I was dying. I was trapped. Every justification in the book I made: work, relationship, I’m mad, I’m happy, let’s party, I’m not drinking, etc. Do you wanna know what it feels like to truly be free? Trusting every day that the next day, I’m gonna feel better than the day I felt before. Tomorrow, I’m gonna be one step closer to living in true alignment with my purpose here.

There’s this story my dad told me years ago that really shaped what I would now call my religion. He told me that when Michelangelo was in the courtyard with a giant slab of marble, many suitors and other critics would come up to him and say, How are you turning that giant piece of marble into a masterpiece? And he responded by saying, I’m just chipping away at everything that isn’t David.

It is my belief that we are only getting closer or further away. The secret is that what we’re getting closer to doesn’t actually exist. We are only becoming more in alignment with what we want by learning what it isn’t. The second I started practicing and living out my true knowing that Feel Free is not closer to who I want to become and how I want to live my life, I knew I had to quit. And I know just from reading this sub over the last year that I am not alone. And I promise you when I was in the thick of it, I did not think I was strong enough—the same way you feel right now.

Don’t think about a year. Think about waking up feeling better tomorrow. I love you guys so much, and I promise I’ll continue to pray for everyone. Feel free to send me a DM. Although I probably won’t be lurking on this sub too long because that’s a part of my old life. And I am new. I am free.",1,1730223756.0,Quittingfeelfree,0,1.0,False

I started a more dedicated approach to curing my HA about two weeks ago. The main changes that I have made are: 

1) eliminating my 5 mile a day run 

2) eating more frequently throughout the day

3) eating more in general, paying attention to carbs and fats 

4) eating first thing in the morning

5) not doing any exercising on an empty stomach

6) cutting out my morning coffee 

7) i've been sleeping more since I don't have to get up so early to work out

  
So far, I have noticed the following changes:

1) My RHR has increased from 43 to 55

2) I am much more regular 

3) yesterday into today I had a horrible headache 

4) today I have cramps 

5) yesterday and today i have nipple tenderness, which I haven't felt since my last cycle which was over a year ago

  
So, yesterday, I took an OPK test (my first one) and it showed a T/C Ratio of .93! (peak)! I'm wondering if I did something wrong, because I'm surprised that I could actually have gotten myself back to ovulation in just 2 weeks? Today, I took another one, and it showed a T/C ratio of .63 (low).

1gf04y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longreads/comments/1gf04y7/airports_the_crossroads_of_human_emotion/,Airports: The Crossroads of Human Emotion,"I am new to reddit, so I apologize if this is too long or not in the correct place.



Airports are places where the full spectrum of human emotions is laid bare. They stand as gateways between beginnings and farewells, arrivals and departures, joy and grief. Underneath the metal detectors, flight announcements, and security checks, they serve as theaters for some of the most intense human experiences. If you take a moment to pause and observe, you will find stories unfolding everywhere: reunions that feel like homecoming, goodbyes that ache like open wounds, and moments of solitude where dreams and memories collide.

# The Bittersweet Nature of Farewell

One of the most universal experiences at an airport is saying goodbye. It’s where relationships are put to the test by time and distance, and where people hold onto each other as if the world might fall apart in that final embrace. There’s something heart-wrenching about watching someone you love disappear behind the cold gates of security, knowing that life will move on without them, at least for a while.

Goodbyes at airports are not always dramatic — sometimes they are quiet, loaded with unspoken words. A brief hug, a whispered “stay safe,” or a wave across the departure hall. But no matter how small the gesture, it holds weight. Every farewell carries a mix of sadness, hope, and uncertainty. Will they come back the same? Will life be different when they return? The airport’s sterile corridors amplify these questions, as people cling to fleeting moments, trying to savor what can’t be stopped — time.

# The Magic of Reunions

On the other side of the airport, there are arrivals—an entirely different kind of emotional explosion. Nothing compares to the feeling of waiting by the arrival gate, scanning the crowd for a familiar face. Time seems to freeze in that space between spotting them and embracing them. When loved ones meet after months or even years apart, the world disappears for a brief moment. Tears flow freely, but they are the good kind — the ones that wash away longing and replace it with relief.

There is magic in these reunions, and it is visible in every tight hug, every squeal of joy, every bouquet of flowers exchanged between lovers, parents, and friends. Even strangers feel the energy — the sight of people being reunited reminds us all of the deep human need for connection. It’s a gentle reminder that, no matter how far we travel, love has a way of pulling us back to where we belong.

# The Loneliness in Transit

Airports are also places of solitude. In between the emotional highs and lows, there are moments when travelers sit quietly, lost in thought. It’s easy to feel untethered in transit, as if floating between two lives — the one left behind and the one waiting ahead. Time becomes fluid in the airport; clocks mean little when your heart is still anchored to the place you left, but your body is already moving toward somewhere new.

Some travelers sit alone at gates, staring at their phones or out the window, not because they are bored but because they are processing. For some, the flight might represent the pursuit of a new beginning — a new job, a new city, or the start of a dream. For others, it might carry the weight of loss — flying home for a funeral, saying goodbye to a chapter of life, or walking away from something they thought would last forever.

It’s in these quiet moments — waiting for boarding, sipping coffee at odd hours, watching planes take off into the sky — that people confront their most honest emotions. It’s where anxiety, hope, excitement, and regret intermingle, as if the airport itself is a mirror reflecting every traveler’s inner world.

# The Promise of New Beginnings

Airports are also places of hope. Every flight represents a new adventure, a chance to escape the familiar, and the promise of something different. Honeymooners board planes filled with excitement for the future. Students set off to explore new cities, fueled by dreams and possibilities. Immigrants walk through the gates with hearts full of courage, stepping toward an uncertain but hopeful future.

The airport’s departure board is filled with possibility — Paris, Tokyo, New York, Johannesburg — each destination a promise that life is waiting to be discovered beyond the horizon. Airports remind us that the world is vast and that there are always new places to explore, new people to meet, and new stories to tell.

# A Microcosm of the Human Experience

In many ways, airports are microcosms of life itself. They are places where paths intersect and diverge, where chance encounters turn into lifelong friendships, and where moments of joy are tempered by sadness. The security lines, boarding calls, and crowded terminals may seem mundane, but beneath the surface, there is a hum of life — of emotions raw and unfiltered, of dreams both fulfilled and deferred.

Airports teach us that life is a series of arrivals and departures. People come and go, but the emotions we experience along the way stay with us. They remind us to cherish the hellos because goodbyes are inevitable, to embrace change because standing still is not an option, and to look forward to new beginnings, even when endings feel impossible.

# In Conclusion: The Beauty in the Chaos

Airports are chaotic and stressful, but they are also filled with moments of breathtaking beauty. In a world that often feels disconnected, airports remind us that we are all part of the same human experience. They show us that love transcends distance, that farewells are never really final, and that every journey, no matter how long or short, holds meaning.

So, the next time you find yourself at an airport, take a moment to look around. Witness the reunions, the goodbyes, the quiet reflections, and the hopeful departures. In these moments, you’ll see that airports aren’t just places where planes take off and land—they are places where hearts break and heal, where journeys begin and end, and where human emotion, in all its messy beauty, takes flight.

I'm 28M Italian, and a few days ago, I posted about my idea for a tiramisù shop here in Dublin. Many of you were enthusiastic, and I've received a lot of support. I can't thank you all enough for that! For that reason I want to update you all on my progress.

I’ve decided to follow the advice of most of you and will be making tiramisù in many different flavors. Yesterday I've developed my new pumpkin spice tiramisù with chai for the spooky season. I have many more recipes ready like matcha, pistacchio, double chocolate, stout, and caramel.

I've found a professional kitchen near where I live that I can rent by the hour, which will be a great help.

Also, as many of you mentioned, it’s better to start small without a physical store. That’s a very wise tip! Therefore, I’ll try to supply coffee shops first and may also offer delivery.

That said, do you have any coffee shops in mind that you think would be happy to have my tiramisù?

*Year: 2069*

He peers through clouds of dust which the full moon has turned into twisting wheels of gray and silver.  Dusty diadems that drift above the old highway with its many canyons of cracks and twisting rivers of patched asphalt.  Shifting ghosts sliding and twisting like dancers on a ballroom floor, dancers that pirouette wildly around the wheels of the gun truck and then drift lazily behind them into the night.  Drumming his fingers on the screen in front of him as he slouches in his seat, the toes of his prosthetic foot wedged into the right-angle where the center console meets the metal floor, heel tapping a backbeat to the staccato of his fingers.  Listening to the voice of his long dead mother tell a story about her childhood, captured in a data center and streamed directly to his auditory canal.  A dull hum fills the truck, this cocoon of ceramic plates, reinforced metal and sensor arrays that he calls home.  A constant, unchanging background noise that has become an almost physical presence that he misses every time he leaves the truck.  He squirms in his seat, pushing his head and shoulders back into the dusty seat and arching his lower back in a mostly futile attempt to relieve the tingling fingers of pain that creep from his spine down his left buttock into his leg.  The screens on the dashboard cast green and blue lights on his face as the maps update and the sensor feeds change and the truck rolls along on thick tires down the once great highway, a highway cracked and sinking and half covered with shifting desert sands.

Jamaal is the driver of Truck One.  But driver is a term kept alive only by tradition.  He sits in the driver’s seat while an AI steers the truck and monitors the engine and watches the highway through sensors far more refined than anything a human has.  Jamaal is a systems engineer and a gunman.  It is his responsibility to guide the AI, to adjust its navigation or find a new course according to the needs of the moment, to supervise the weapons systems, to pick out and prioritize targets.  Only in emergencies does Jamaal put his hands on the steering wheel and his foot on the gas pedal.  But they’re in a line of business that leaves him plenty of reasons to grab the wheel.

In the seat next to Jamaal is Wade.  Wade is there because he’s the skipper, because they’re all ex-military except for Percy and that’s how they’re used to doing it, and because it’s good to have an extra human around when the shit hits the fan.  Some companies cross the desert with only one person per vehicle, saving money on headcount.  But AI models have significant performance limitations in unfamiliar situations.  Not what you want in a firefight.  Not what you want when you only carry high value shipments.

It is hot in Truck One.  The desert sun cooks the parched land to an easy 130, 140 degrees during the day, and even at night it can stay above 90 degrees.  The truck is not built for comfort and the A/C is weak, designed for an era where average temperatures were a good 12 degrees lower.  This is real heat, heat that bakes you in slow waves of pressure – not the kind of heat where you can roll the windows down and cool off in the breeze.  Anyway, Jamaal does not have the luxury of windows that roll down – a lot of these old military surplus vehicles have sealed windows or no windows at all to protect against chemical weapons seized.  Weapons the Army of God used in ’38 at the Vegas Salient.  And kept using until the 3rd Air Wing out of Tacoma dropped a low ordnance nuke on Cheyenne to remind the government in Salt Lake that The California Republic owned the air and they could drop what they liked, wherever they liked.

If they really need some extra ventilation there is a hatch above Wade so that he can stand on his seat and look out over the surrounding terrain and have better fields of fire for his SCAR or grenade launcher.  Not that he does so very often.  There are sensor pods mounted on the left and right of the hood as well as in a turret at the rear.  They had invested a couple million in upgraded the sensors a couple years back and added dual-mounted  Heckler & Koch MG5 machine guns bought with Columbian fetanyl from some Confederate soldiers during a run to Atlanta.  An AI sub-persona, separate from the truck AI, controls the turret and the sensor pods.  It is faster and more accurate than a human, but has the minor problem of shooting indiscriminately at any warm-blooded target when engaged.

Jamaal hums as he – as the truck – drives.  Occasional clusters of human figures emerge in the darkness on the sides of the road.  They walk slowly, half turning as the truck approaches, a few offering hopeful gestures, a shy smile and a wave or a hand in a fist with the thumb pointing down the road.  They are secos, immigrants from the vast lands that stretch from Death Valley to the Missouri River and from Calgary in the north all the way to the Phoenix Free State.  New Judea controls only parts of this vast realm: the old states of Idaho and Utah and most of Montana,  slivers of Wyoming and Colorado.  The rest is the Great Empty: a physical and metaphorical desert created by war, drought, and rising temperatures.  A few city-states like Albuquerque and Omaha continue to survive, hubs for trade and transportation in this medieval world where distances are once again made great by violence and the limitations of long-distance commercial flight in a mostly post-hydrocarbon world.  Outside the walls of those fragile city states are hundreds of miles of land prowled by peoples with nothing left to lose.

The secos, shuffling on tired feet with heads bowed by fatigue, are heading south towards the stability of the Federal Republic of Mexico and perhaps even on toward the sprawling verdant lands of South America where their skills in farming and building and machinery can be put to use in economies that are growing fast to fill the space left by the collapse of the Old Republic three decades prior.  They are led by coyotes who will take them through the Borderlands, paying fees on their behalf to the narco-lords for safe passage.  For those who can’t afford the cost of a coyote there are winding routes that lead across deserts and mountains.  But those paths are treacherous and most of those who are too poor to pay for safe passage will simply cross the I-10 and register at one of the many checkpoints operated by the cartels.  There are always jobs to be had as servants, mules, or molls in the narco-states.  The lucky few with the right education can get jobs in pharmatech and help create the hot designer drug.  Nothing in the Western Hemisphere will pay as well as what is available in The California Republic, but that border was closed two years ago in the wake of political backlash against the immigrants that streamed into California and Oregon in a series of waves known as The Great Migrations.  Too many refugees fleeing from New Judea and Western Canada and sparking fears that the culture of The Republic was under threat from foreigners who didn’t share their work ethic, their belief in individual rights, and their respect for technology.

Jamaal sees the wreckage of vehicles on the sides of the road and the distinctive logo of CRAID.  Jamaal remembers providing security for humanitarian aid teams, somewhere out east, some shithole city that looked just like the one they had left.  Dumb fucking job.  Dumb fucking politicians.   That was from back when the California Republic thought it could bring democracy to the Wastelands, before it decided Californian lives were too precious to waste saving people who didn’t want to be saved.  He taps the dash and checks their battery status.  The dark miles roll on.  Jamaal watches the screens arrayed in front of him.  His cochlear implant streams the sounds of his dead mother’s voice into his auditory nerve.  He drinks cold coffee an oversized mug and occasionally coaxes his medplant to give him a hit of synthetic beta-endorphins, just a bit more than his doctor advises.  He reaches blindly behind his seat and searches through the cardboard box of ratfucked MREs until his hand find something that feels like candy.

He and Wade don’t talk much.  They’ve been doing this for a long time.  Jamaal doesn’t mind the silence.",1,1730222458.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

I've spent some time on the U of M websites looking into the major but I have a few questions and concerns.

Why I might want to switch:

\- I love organic chemistry and would love to take o-chem 2 for actual degree credit (call me crazy I dont care)

\- I nerd out about food chemistry all. of. the. time. I am quite literally obsessed with nixtamalization of corn. It's impact on the Aztecs is my roman empire and please please please I just want to make masa from scratch. 

\- I'm currently in CBS and am a bit put off by the overwhelmingly pre-med environment (it's too stuffy for me, I dont want to save lives I just want to make mead and cheese and miso and malt and mill flour)

\- I'm coming to realize that I like using science more than doing science (I'm not all that interested in making new discoveries, but understanding and applying old ones) 

Concerns:

\- I worry that a food science degree would pin me to working with hyper-processed foods or massive food conglomerates. I don't want to make kraft singles..

\- Again, I'm honestly not that interested in innovation, so if the only real career fields that make decent money involve innovation in things like preservatives and food dyes or inspection of processing plants then thats less than ideal. 

\- Would the program prepare me to work with smaller independent companies like breweries or to even start my own smaller business? I guess my question is how strictly is the program based on large-scale industrial food processing? I'm not completely opposed to industry but to me there is a big difference between making cheez-its and working in an independent coffee bean roastery

1gezy47,https://i.redd.it/6gm9cnpraqxd1.jpeg,Citiz Platinum recommendations,"Hi all,
I upgraded my machine last weekend. Had an OL Essenza Mini and wanted something bigger/more premium. I had a hard time deciding between the VL and the OL but ultimately went with an OL again. Decided on the Citiz Platinum because I already own an Aerocino 4.
I like it so far. The machine looks good and is easy to use. The bigger water tank and capsule bin are a real upgrade. 

I also have some questions/am looking for some recommendations. 
- Nespresso states that the hot water button can be used for tea. As far as I know the water is not boiling so it’s not suitable for black tea. But white/green tea should be fine, right? Does anyone know how hot the water is once it reaches your cup?
- Does anyone have recommendations for the right pods and settings for Americano and Americano XL? Should I be using an espresso pod or a lungo pod? I can’t find this information in the manual or on the Nespresso website. 
The standard setting for Americano uses only 25 ml of coffee and then adds 125 ml of hot water. XL uses 40 ml of coffee and then adds 160 ml of hot water. 
Does anyone have better settings for the volume and a recommended lid to use? So far I have tried an espresso pod with 40 ml coffee and 110 ml water. Seems fine but I’m wondering if there are better options. Would a lungo pod give better results?

1gezwt7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gezwt7,open floorplan living/dining,"hi all, this is my first home and it was a new construction so there is a LOT of work to do making this bare white box feel lived in. in addition to never having done this before I apparently do not have an eye for design and the room(s) I'm struggling most with are my living/kitchen/dining area.

the biggest thing I'm torn on right now is a dining set. my style is kind of a mix between mcm/scandinavian but [this](https://www.castlery.com/us/products/sloane-dining-set-for-6-8) set from castlery is my favorite that I've seen (I'm a sucker for fluting), and they have a matching sideboard, which is something I've been really wanting for this space. however I'm worried that the darker wood doesn't really mesh with the kitchen and living room, but at the same time lighter oak colors are harder to match as my flooring is LVP, so it tends to look orange or yellow in comparison. the style itself also seems more formal, if that makes any sense? it might be too matchy matchy?

the living room, aside from paint and doing something with the tray ceiling, is mostly done, but something feels off about it. I think maybe the rug needs more color and the papasan cushion be swapped to anything but white. I like the vibe of the coffee tables but maybe that's what is throwing the room off.

my plan is to restyle the kitchen entirely, I'm stuck with the granite but I'll be changing the cabinet doors/drawers out for either a shaker or flat panel style, and painting the white cabinets more of a cream color and the island sw pewter green. and new handles that are all the correct size for the door they're on, of course.

It’s a distinctive and easily recognisable smell, in that I clock it very quickly as the particular smell I can’t tolerate, but I don’t know what it is, not being so au fait with perfume making and common ingredients.  I’ve detected it especially strongly in a perfume by a local small batch perfumer on Etsy (note: this was a bad idea) which was so bad I had to get a shower and scrub and then use hand sanitiser to try to kill it).  Is anyone able to tell me what on earth this is? 


It’s been a very short sad journey for me and this perfume house - I love the idea and on paper they all sound amazing, but I just cannot stand this ingredient or whatever it is that they seem to use in large amounts in the ones I’ve tried so far.

I have been at my job for about a year and a half now. I know I WAY overshared about my personal life slat my last job, and it certainly didn't help with keeping things professional with my overall immature group of colleagues. I went into my current job telling myself that I would keep my personal life way on the backburner, but everyone at work is so genuinely curious about who their coworkers are as people, and I find myself sharing more than I really want to. 

Recently, several people at work now know I have a UTI. The topic of who is and isn't drinking coffee somehow always comes up, and I just can't keep my mouth shut, and I say that I have been trying to stay off coffee. Then people inevitably ask why, and I can't just come up with something made up on the fly. Part of me is telling myself that it doesn't really matter because I know a lot about my coworkers too. I know that my boss needed iui to have kids, someone else had hernia surgery recently, I know who has a colonoscopy coming up, and I know who gets diarrhea from coffee. But another part of me feels like telling a coworker I have a UTI is one step away from announcing I have a yeast infection or an STD. I'd rather just not share anything. 

How do you stop yourself from revealing personal info at work, particularly if you have trouble NOT putting your coworkers on friend level? I want to get over this recent faux pas, and at least I work with people who are truly adults and don't make a big deal out of normal human body stuff, BUT I'm also sitting here like,  ""OMG, why did I just tell Tom from IT that I have a UTI??""",0,1730221980.0,work,1,0.5,False

Lol,"I just want to preface this with, I know no one on here can tell me I’m going to be okay, but I just need a couple of questions answered if any of you have been through something similar. Plus I’m wondering if this is normal. (But also, after reading a lot of posts on here, I believe the gastritis community doesn’t know what normal is anymore and I feel so bad for each and every one of you and what you’re going through with your health and doctors UGH)
I’m 26F. I just got over the worst flu I have ever had. 6 straight days of feeling absolutely miserable. It gave me the worst migraine and then after, a sinus headache that’s honestly still lingering. I was taking tylenol for most of the time but then because of my sinus infection, I began having a lot of pain behind my eyes. So I started taking ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hrs and it was helping so much with just the eye pain. But because I was still sick, and worried it wasn’t going to get better, I started taking an antibiotic—Amoxicillin. I only took the ibuprofen for 2 and half days, and the antibiotic for like almost 2 days. Amoxicillin gives me horrible anxiety and I thought that it was also making me nauseous. Eventually I couldn’t take the anxiety and nausea anymore and stopped taking the antibiotic. But I took one more dose of ibuprofen before my mom told me I should probably stop that too after I was complaining about feeling like I need to burp but I couldn’t. 
I’ve been off of those since yesterday and went to bed last night still anxiety ridden and my stomach feeling so bleh—idk what the word is for that feeling. 
I’ve been doing a lot of googling which I know is a no no to a lot of doctors but I live in another country where medical isn’t trustworthy in my opinion and you just gotta figure it out for yourself. If things don’t get any better I will cave and go see someone. Anyway, I discovered that taking antibiotics while taking ibuprofen can cause gastritis. I’m just not completely convinced because I was only taking it for such a short period of time but my symptoms line up with gastritis, save for the fact I’m not throwing up and I don’t have diarrhea. The stomach bloating and feeling really full after only eating a little bit makes me think I have it or I’ve at least irritated my stomach lining? I haven’t had coffee the entire time I was sick and had my first and only small cup yesterday morning. I haven’t had any today just to be on the safe side. I don’t have any history of gut issues and I don’t drink whatsoever. Does this sound like gastritis? If so, I’ve scared myself a little with all the stories I’ve read and am now worried it’s not gonna be an easy thing to go away. I obviously will not be taking ibuprofen or the antibiotic anymore. But if anyone can give me some pointers or tips and tricks to relieve the fullness feeling and maybe hope that this will just go away in a couple of days?",1,1730221794.0,Gastritis,9,1.0,False

Truth be told, I have tried several of Neville Goddard's techniques except one: I will not climb a ladder technique. Now the reason I hadn't tried this technique was not because I didn't believe, but because I have a strong belief that anything I intend to come into the awareness of, I will, and I wasn't eager to climb a ladder, and I didn't need to prove the law to myself because I already know it works. I just knew at some point it would come!

Now, I had been rearranging some things at my home and desired a cute desk for when I wanted to do work at home- typically I would go to a coffee shop, school campus, or just work at the table, but I've always had a desk and felt more productive. For the past couple of months I would look at pictures of desks, but I didn't want just anyone, and I also had a budget for myself of not wanting to spend more than $100. It had to be white and fit in the space I wanted to place it. I didn't want just anyone. I told two people I wanted a desk, one was sp and the other was my friend.

I would just peruse and had narrowed it down, but hadn't told anyone the exact size I wanted or which ones I was considering. A couple days ago, my sp said he had bought me a desk as an early birthday/Christmas present which 1. was so sweet and 2. my birthday is months away. What was surprising is I had mentioned it briefly and didn't make a big deal about it because I have been pretty happy working at various coffee shops or the school campus.

He sent me a picture of the one he ordered and it was white. I never told him I wanted a white desk, I just like the color white/beige/cream because this feels light and clean. It was so cute. I expressed my deepest gratitude and told him the only thing I wasn't sure of was the dimensions for the space I would place it. So I measured the exact dimensions and told him I might need a slightly smaller one.

He told me to pick the one I wanted and he would cancel that one. Again, I was super grateful and he was understanding. The desk I picked was the perfect size and was cheaper too! I set it up and am typing this post up from the desk, and just feel so grateful, and wanted to share with all of you, that this didn't have any solid techniques, but there was IMAGINATION. I would peruse the internet looking for any desks that caught my attention and screenshot it. I wasn't obsessive; it was just something I would do during my breaks. I also would imagine a desk in the space I would want because there had never been a desk there.

Back to the ladder. I began arranging and organizing things in my room in preparation for this new desk, and of course, I needed a ladder. I had to put things on top shelves. I climbed the ladder the same day this desk was going to be delivered. It didn't surprise me, and I knew it would happen. Again, it could have happened sooner, but I personally have never tried that specific technique of Neville's.

I have, though, always held the assumption it would happen. Just your reminder that good things are happening, the Divine hears us, and the assumptions we hold have strong influence as to what happens in our reality!",9,1730221662.0,NevilleGoddard2,0,1.0,False

How do you not get drawn to them? ","I (26M) am currently studying in Korea, and still as closeted as I was in my hometown. I’m only open to my closest and most trusted friends only. And since I’m sure this is a pretty conservative country, I decided to stay as such while I wait to find my tribe (though ngl it’s been so hard to find community here).

Good to note: As an extrovert, I used to always initiate getting to know people I want to be friends with, or a person I’m interested in. But the pandemic isolation shifted me in a way that for some reason I don’t want to go out of my way to do that anymore. Also crediting a major heartbreak from a guy who happened to see me just as a really good friend. 

It wasn’t until one month that I made friends in class. And it wasn’t until two weeks ago that I met a guy who wanted to become language exchange partners. This Korean happens to be the first guy ever in recent memory (both here and in my hometown) that approached me on their own.

Naturally, as a closeted queer who’s always the “befriender” and never the “befriended”, I felt too shocked and flattered since thr locals aren’t necessarily top-of-mind friendliest towards my nationality as of my friends’ stories, my observation, and some scrolling through Reddit haha. I might be overreacting but I genuinely don’t even remember how it feels to be befriended anymore. It felt so fun and great that, yes, you guessed it: I went over my head and got too delusional to see where it goes in a different light. I think the queer media I’ve been consuming recently also added fuel to the fire.

It’s only been a few weeks but we’ve managed to take very long walks while teaching languages to each other, and even made time to meet in cafes late at night to do the same. I started asking my friends if straight guys usually hang out that long here just to talk, since I really have no idea how to process my superficial excitement. But as everyone on the internet said: you can’t trust your gaydar in Korea.

I was enjoying it all too much so the universe reminded me that he’s a MAN man that’s just being friendly and wants to learn English (to be fair he’s not shortchanging me on Korean). But at a recent coffee meet-up, he was just asking how to explain a certain expression. But when I asked back how to say it in Korean, it apparently ends up becoming a very sexist and misogynist phrase sprinkled with borrowed English words. He reaffirms that “it’s fine to say it with just your close guy friends”. In the interest of social learning, I told him why he shouldn’t say things like that in both languages. But that moment blocked me from whatever road I was planning to tread.

It was a good feeling to be pulled out of that fantasy. (Well, he did already say he went on a blind date with a girl over the weekend. While it’s easy to lie about that, actions just HAD to speak louder than words lol) I’m just worried that I’ll just always have a hard time getting out of this scenario where I always end up projecting the companionship I yearn for each time I meet a kind, approachable guy that comes to me first.

It might be weird to ask advice for this, but I’m sincerely asking: how do you not get drawn to mere kindness? How do you hold on to the hope that the right person will come to you? And not go crazy to the kindest guy in the room like a dog playing tricks for treats?

As someone who’s never been in a committed relationship, but has had his fair share of both breaking hearts and being heartbroken, I don’t really know anymore if I’ll ever be in a relationship. It’s hard enough not being able to socialize over drinks anymore due to health constraints, and I’m not even at the bare minimum of their dating app standards here (apparently you have to be so toned or buffed to be considered for a right swipe). So yeah. I’m just yapping for a footnote, but thanks if you made it this far. Just wanted to keep hoping that someone’s meant for me eventually.",5,1730221296.0,bisexualadults,0,1.0,False

Here's the context: My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 year, we don't live together and I have a dog. Last week was very stressful for me, and I felt overwhelmed. After the event that caused the stress was over, my boyfriend messaged me to see if he could come over the next day. I replied that I'd rather decompress and be alone, as I needed some time to myself. He agreed but mentioned that he wanted to come talk to me about something. I asked if it was urgent or serious, but he said it depended and that he didn't want to discuss it over whatsapp. So, I suggested we meet in two days so I could still decompress.

Later that evening, he messaged me again, saying he wasn't feeling well—not because of his depression, but because he was feeling down. He ended up saying he'd try to sleep, and I wished him a good night.

The next day, he offered to bring me something from the coffee shop, but I declined as I was already drinking a homemade coffee. Then, he suggested walking the dog since I said I needed time alone. I replied that I would take care of it myself and that it would do me good.

He also has a history of using this tactic in the past to come over to my place and stay until he gets what he wants. In this case, it was to talk to me. I am a very anxious person, and he knows very well that saying ""we need to talk"" usually causes me a lot of anxiety. The difference this time is that I decided not to play along and set a boundary. And now he is trying in every way to make me give in. He has a habit of trying to manipulate me like this and lying to make excuses for his behavior.

Later, he mentioned that he wanted to plan his week and know if he should take care of the dog. I said I could handle it and that we'd discuss the rest of the week later. He then said he didn't necessarily want to go to the office, but just wanted to know if he should take care of the dog. I said no, not tomorrow morning.

At that point, he made a comment saying that someone else didn't want to see him because of what he wanted to say. I explained that I just wanted some time alone and that I had suggested we meet another day, but he kept finding ways to come over, even under the pretense of helping me. He responded that he just wanted to help and that dropping by to bring me a coffee would have quick.

Later that evening, he told me it was ""rough"" to feel like seeing him for a short time would ruin my day, and that it hurt him to constantly feel that way. He said we could talk about it another night.

I feel a bit lost because, on one hand, I really needed time for myself, but on the other, I understand that my responses may have hurt him. So, AITA for wanting to take some time alone, even though it clearly hurt him?",1,1730221040.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.67,False
1gezhhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Airports/comments/1gezhhu/airports_the_crossroads_of_human_emotion/,Airports: The Crossroads of Human Emotion,"Airports are places where the full spectrum of human emotions is laid bare. They stand as gateways between beginnings and farewells, arrivals and departures, joy and grief. Underneath the metal detectors, flight announcements, and security checks, they serve as theaters for some of the most intense human experiences. If you take a moment to pause and observe, you will find stories unfolding everywhere: reunions that feel like homecoming, goodbyes that ache like open wounds, and moments of solitude where dreams and memories collide.

# The Bittersweet Nature of Farewell

One of the most universal experiences at an airport is saying goodbye. It’s where relationships are put to the test by time and distance, and where people hold onto each other as if the world might fall apart in that final embrace. There’s something heart-wrenching about watching someone you love disappear behind the cold gates of security, knowing that life will move on without them, at least for a while.

Goodbyes at airports are not always dramatic — sometimes they are quiet, loaded with unspoken words. A brief hug, a whispered “stay safe,” or a wave across the departure hall. But no matter how small the gesture, it holds weight. Every farewell carries a mix of sadness, hope, and uncertainty. Will they come back the same? Will life be different when they return? The airport’s sterile corridors amplify these questions, as people cling to fleeting moments, trying to savor what can’t be stopped — time.

# The Magic of Reunions

On the other side of the airport, there are arrivals—an entirely different kind of emotional explosion. Nothing compares to the feeling of waiting by the arrival gate, scanning the crowd for a familiar face. Time seems to freeze in that space between spotting them and embracing them. When loved ones meet after months or even years apart, the world disappears for a brief moment. Tears flow freely, but they are the good kind — the ones that wash away longing and replace it with relief.

There is magic in these reunions, and it is visible in every tight hug, every squeal of joy, every bouquet of flowers exchanged between lovers, parents, and friends. Even strangers feel the energy — the sight of people being reunited reminds us all of the deep human need for connection. It’s a gentle reminder that, no matter how far we travel, love has a way of pulling us back to where we belong.

# The Loneliness in Transit

Airports are also places of solitude. In between the emotional highs and lows, there are moments when travelers sit quietly, lost in thought. It’s easy to feel untethered in transit, as if floating between two lives — the one left behind and the one waiting ahead. Time becomes fluid in the airport; clocks mean little when your heart is still anchored to the place you left, but your body is already moving toward somewhere new.

Some travelers sit alone at gates, staring at their phones or out the window, not because they are bored but because they are processing. For some, the flight might represent the pursuit of a new beginning — a new job, a new city, or the start of a dream. For others, it might carry the weight of loss — flying home for a funeral, saying goodbye to a chapter of life, or walking away from something they thought would last forever.

It’s in these quiet moments — waiting for boarding, sipping coffee at odd hours, watching planes take off into the sky — that people confront their most honest emotions. It’s where anxiety, hope, excitement, and regret intermingle, as if the airport itself is a mirror reflecting every traveler’s inner world.

# The Promise of New Beginnings

Airports are also places of hope. Every flight represents a new adventure, a chance to escape the familiar, and the promise of something different. Honeymooners board planes filled with excitement for the future. Students set off to explore new cities, fueled by dreams and possibilities. Immigrants walk through the gates with hearts full of courage, stepping toward an uncertain but hopeful future.

The airport’s departure board is filled with possibility — Paris, Tokyo, New York, Johannesburg — each destination a promise that life is waiting to be discovered beyond the horizon. Airports remind us that the world is vast and that there are always new places to explore, new people to meet, and new stories to tell.

# A Microcosm of the Human Experience

In many ways, airports are microcosms of life itself. They are places where paths intersect and diverge, where chance encounters turn into lifelong friendships, and where moments of joy are tempered by sadness. The security lines, boarding calls, and crowded terminals may seem mundane, but beneath the surface, there is a hum of life — of emotions raw and unfiltered, of dreams both fulfilled and deferred.

Airports teach us that life is a series of arrivals and departures. People come and go, but the emotions we experience along the way stay with us. They remind us to cherish the hellos because goodbyes are inevitable, to embrace change because standing still is not an option, and to look forward to new beginnings, even when endings feel impossible.

# In Conclusion: The Beauty in the Chaos

Airports are chaotic and stressful, but they are also filled with moments of breathtaking beauty. In a world that often feels disconnected, airports remind us that we are all part of the same human experience. They show us that love transcends distance, that farewells are never really final, and that every journey, no matter how long or short, holds meaning.

So, the next time you find yourself at an airport, take a moment to look around. Witness the reunions, the goodbyes, the quiet reflections, and the hopeful departures. In these moments, you’ll see that airports aren’t just places where planes take off and land—they are places where hearts break and heal, where journeys begin and end, and where human emotion, in all its messy beauty, takes flight.

1gezheg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinnCoffee/comments/1gezheg/rrod_transport_worm_spinning_continuously_leak/,RROD: Transport worm spinning continuously + leak issue ** FIX **,"Symptoms:

* Transport worm spinning when coffee is not being made
* Leaking water from bottom
* Evidence of condensation around translucent ""edge"" of bean hopper
* Short grinds, weak coffee, failed brew

The first two symptoms were the most obvious.  I did the usual transport worm cleaning to no effect.  I  removed the bean hopper (5 screws, including the one covered by a ""warranty void"" sticker that's at the back and requires the water tank to be removed), disassembled the grinder and cleaned it out.  There was a lot of moisture on various parts, including a sensor that is on the top of the transport screw.  The moisture was coming from a small hole in the topmost clear plastic tube, just past the connection with the blue valve.  It was close enough to the end that I was able to cut the last 1/2"" of tubing and reconnect without overly stressing the tube\*.  I used an air can and a hair dryer to clean and dry all the electrical connections (paying extra attention to the sensor on top of the transport screw).  I did also remove the base and dry that out for good measure, although I doubt it was necessary.

*N.B.* During this repair, I discovered that Spinn seem to chosen slightly unusual Torx bits - I had a TT8 for the 5th ""security screw"" to remove the hopper, but everything else seemed to be a \~size down from the typical ones that you're likely to have in a bit set.  I was able to use, e.g., a TT15 to remove screws that were really a fraction smaller by seating the bit carefully and maintaining reasonable positive pressure while unscrewing.

Regarding the leak, I think this is quite a likely location for this sort of thing to occur because of the vibration and strain on the tube as it bends 90 degrees from the metal connection point.

Coffee is back and being made without fuss or leaks and my wife's tailored Americano is now full strength and 10 oz (presumably the leak was short-changing us before).

\*It's good that the leak was here because a lot of tubes go downwards into the guts of the machine and it would require significantly more effort to access them.  Note that the tube in question is actually very short (maybe 4-5"") and connects to another tube via a small connector that is wrapped in protective sponge rubber shielding (presumably to guard against vibration damage from the main motor that is right next to it).  There was enough slack to allow reconnection after removing 1/2"" of tubing but I'm not confident that would work a second time, so I will try and find a source for the correct size tubing and order it lest the problem recur.  A fair number of other tubes in the machine seem to be of the same gauge.

1gezgpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gezgpc/having_a_hard_time_defining_connections_with/,"Having a hard time defining connections with genuine, just-being-friendly straight men. How do you not get drawn to them? ","I (26M) am currently studying in Korea, and still as closeted as I was in my hometown. I’m only open to my closest and most trusted friends only. And since I’m sure this is a pretty conservative country, I decided to stay as such while I wait to find my tribe (though ngl it’s been so hard to find community here).

Good to note: As an extrovert, I used to always initiate getting to know people I want to be friends with, or a person I’m interested in. But the pandemic isolation shifted me in a way that for some reason I don’t want to go out of my way to do that anymore. Also crediting a major heartbreak from a guy who happened to see me just as a really good friend. 

It wasn’t until one month that I made friends in class. And it wasn’t until two weeks ago that I met a guy who wanted to become language exchange partners. This Korean happens to be the first guy ever in recent memory (both here and in my hometown) that approached me on their own.

Naturally, as a closeted queer who’s always the “befriender” and never the “befriended”, I felt too shocked and flattered since thr locals aren’t necessarily top-of-mind friendliest towards my nationality as of my friends’ stories, my observation, and some scrolling through Reddit haha. I might be overreacting but I genuinely don’t even remember how it feels to be befriended anymore. It felt so fun and great that, yes, you guessed it: I went over my head and got too delusional to see where it goes in a different light. I think the queer media I’ve been consuming recently also added fuel to the fire.

It’s only been a few weeks but we’ve managed to take very long walks while teaching languages to each other, and even made time to meet in cafes late at night to do the same. I started asking my friends if straight guys usually hang out that long here just to talk, since I really have no idea how to process my superficial excitement. But as everyone on the internet said: you can’t trust your gaydar in Korea.

I was enjoying it all too much so the universe reminded me that he’s a MAN man that’s just being friendly and wants to learn English (to be fair he’s not shortchanging me on Korean). But at a recent coffee meet-up, he was just asking how to explain a certain expression. But when I asked back how to say it in Korean, it apparently ends up becoming a very sexist and misogynist phrase sprinkled with borrowed English words. He reaffirms that “it’s fine to say it with just your close guy friends”. In the interest of social learning, I told him why he shouldn’t say things like that in both languages. But that moment blocked me from whatever road I was planning to tread.

It was a good feeling to be pulled out of that fantasy. (Well, he did already say he went on a blind date with a girl over the weekend. While it’s easy to lie about that, actions just HAD to speak louder than words lol) I’m just worried that I’ll just always have a hard time getting out of this scenario where I always end up projecting the companionship I yearn for each time I meet a kind, approachable guy that comes to me first.

It might be weird to ask advice for this, but I’m sincerely asking: how do you not get drawn to mere kindness? How do you hold on to the hope that the right person will come to you? And not go crazy to the kindest guy in the room like a dog playing tricks for treats?

As someone who’s never been in a committed relationship, but has had his fair share of both breaking hearts and being heartbroken, I don’t really know anymore if I’ll ever be in a relationship. It’s hard enough not being able to socialize over drinks anymore due to health constraints, and I’m not even at the bare minimum of their dating app standards here (apparently you have to be so toned or buffed to be considered for a right swipe). So yeah. I’m just yapping for a footnote, but thanks if you made it this far. Just wanted to keep hoping that someone’s meant for me eventually.",0,1730220959.0,askgaybros,0,0.5,False

I'm looking for some advice on how to make my teeth whiter, preferably with at-home methods. I've read that professional whitening at a dentist is best, but in my country, insurance doesn’t cover whitening, and I currently don’t have the budget for it.

I've tried a lot of things I found online, but nothing seems to work. I’ve used whitening strips, hydrogen peroxide, and various types of toothpaste, but no luck. I believe I have good oral hygiene—I brush twice a day, use mouthwash (Listerine), gargle with salt water, and use a tongue scraper occasionally. I don’t drink coffee or tea, don’t smoke, and rarely have alcohol or sugary drinks, mostly just water. Yet, my teeth are noticeably more yellow than the whites of my eyes and more yellow compared to others around me.

This is sort of a pet peeve. It’s happened to me (23f) three times recently. 

The first time was for a film project and this guy (18m) would never start a conversation with me. He’s a chatty theater kid and he would butt in whenever I talked to a lead actress and try to steal her attention (he’s already in a LDR with a girl). Every time I was in a group conversation he would never look at me and at one point turned away when I said something to him. There was a moment when the cinematographer had to tell him to not forget me when taking coffee orders for the crew. 

The second time was on college campus after practicing group presentations. My group and another group with a similar topic talked about what we should improve on. The leader in the other group made eye contact and talked with my members except me, even when I responded to her. I was standing right there. 

The most recent time was when I went to go vote with a friend. We got done at the same time and gave the ballots to an old man at the machine. He suddenly started explaining something sports related to her and didn’t look at me once even though I was standing right there. She even looked at me a few times but he was locked the fuck in. 

What is happening? I’m not the most social person in the world but I’m aware of how rude it is to ignore people and I make eye contact with everyone when talking to multiple people.

The first time was for a film project and this guy (18m) would never start a conversation with me. He’s a chatty theater kid and he would butt in whenever I talked to a lead actress and try to steal her attention (he’s already in a LDR with a girl). Every time I was in a group conversation he would never look at me and at one point turned away when I said something to him. There was a moment when the cinematographer had to tell him to not forget me when taking coffee orders for the crew. 

The second time was on college campus after practicing group presentations. My group and another group with a similar topic talked about what we should improve on. The leader in the other group made eye contact and talked with my members except me, even when I responded to her. I was standing right there. 

The most recent time was when I went to go vote with a friend. We got done at the same time and gave the ballots to an old man at the machine. He suddenly started explaining something sports related to her and didn’t look at me once even though I was standing right there. She even looked at me a few times but he was locked the fuck in. 

What is happening? I’m not the most social person in the world but I’m aware of how rude it is to ignore people and I make eye contact with everyone when talking to multiple people.

I'm a very emotional person and sometimes feel like I've communicated with people telepathically because I was focusing on them so much or because of a certain coping mechanism I like to engage in.

One example: a friend of mine got into an argument with me and said some really hurtful things that crossed the line. They were unapologetic when we hung up over call. That night, I focused on how much I wanted them to realize their mistake and feel guilty or at least, experience the same treatment so that they could regret taking advantage of my trust. I just kept muttering how much I wanted for them to receive that consequence while I was cleaning my room. Very early the next morning (about 5 AM) they called me several times back to back. When I picked up later that day, they asked if I was okay and said they kept seeing me in their dreams last night and felt bad about what they had done. I'm not sure if that's just a coincidence or just their guilt naturally happening. But it struck me as odd that they saw me in their dream.

Second example: I realized very recently that I have a crush on one of the baristas at a coffee shop I've been going to for several years. I've always considered myself straight, even though I've had no attraction to any men I've dated in the past. But now I think I might be bisexual and have been trying to confront my strong feelings for this lady. A few days ago, I decided to just deal with my emotions by writing letters to her, kissing them, and then burning them in a candle. I already journal every day but I felt like it was too embarassing to keep those entries in my diary and I felt like the candles symbolized my burning passion in a way. I know we can never be together because she has a boyfriend who visits her at work sometimes, so my goal was just for ME to get over her by pretending as though I've confessed everything on my chest. Anyways, she's been treating me a bit differently than before even though my behavior around her has remained the same. I caught her staring at me several times while I was studying at the cafe and she seemed more shy when I was ordering from her. This has happened on two occasions so far. I don't know if my little routine helped her pick up on my emotions, too, since I was trying to release them and not feel so burdened by having one-sided passion and admiration for her. 

Stuff like this has happened several other times in the past, these are just recent examples. I don't know if I should look into these things. Have you guys heard of this before or is it all in my head? I appreciate any advice. ",0,1730220411.0,Witch,5,0.33,False

Subjects are broken into small segments that might take a typical kid 5 minutes to finish but takes my kids 15-20, i.e., 2 spelling exercises in their workbook or transcribing a few sentences for penmanship, etc. We touch the subjects more often (like 5 days a week) so that we move through the content at a good tick without having to suffer through a 30 minute grammar lesson.

1gez4ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1gez4ng/creatine_sleep_quality_tradeoff/,Creatine & sleep quality trade-off,"I've been observing something odd with creatine and my sleep quality, and I’d love some insights. Despite the research, posts and comments I’ve seen, it seems the effect on sleep can vary—some people are totally fine, but I’m one of those who really notice worse sleep on creatine, and I'm not alone.

For context, I’m a 190 cm, 85 kg male, quite muscular, and I’ve been taking 8-10g of creatine daily (in the morning) for about 2 years. I know that’s on the higher end, but I’ve read higher doses may have extra cognitive benefits, so I figured it might be worth it. I go to the gym about 4x a week, and creatine has definitely improved my performance/strength in the gym, and greatly boosted my energy during the day.

However, it’s clearly affecting my sleep. It takes me about 45 minutes to fall asleep, and I get noticeably less deep sleep (only 20-40 minutes according to my Apple Watch). I already take magnesium bisglycinate before bed and avoid caffeine as much as possible, and never after noon. But when I stop taking creatine, my sleep pattern improves—I fall asleep within 15 minutes (no more overthinking in bed!), get around 45-60 minutes of deep sleep, and feel naturally tired by night. Since my daytime energy dips quite a bit, I’m considering a small morning coffee to help balance that out.

Yes, my strength and stamina in the gym have decreased a bit, but so has my puffy face from the water retention. This was actually the main reason I was experimenting recently with quitting creatine to see if my face would become less round (I'm currently bulking).

This is the first time I connected the dots and see the link between creatine supplementation and sleep quality. Now I think about it, other periods without creatine supplementation, also improved my sleep a lot. However, I didn't know at that time, so it can't be placebo/nocebo.

Here is my questions for anyone knowledgeable: what’s better for overall health, muscle growth, hormone levels (test and growth hormone) and recovery? Getting full and longer deep sleep without creatine or maintaining the boosted energy and recovery with less sleep on creatine? I know that creatine reduces the 'need' for longer and deeper sleep, but long-term, wouldn't more natural deep sleep be better?

To clarify, I don’t have trouble staying asleep or sleeping for a full eight hours with creatine; I can still get a consistent 8 hours whether I am taking it or not. The issue is that creatine makes it take much longer for me to fall asleep, and it significantly reduces my deep sleep, which is my main concern.

1gez2qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/twilight/comments/1gez2qf/what_if_twilight_hadnt_been_written_by_sm/,What if Twilight hadn't been written by SM?,"Hey there! So, I've read many posts in this sub that have highlighted how Stephenie Meyer's religious views have affected the admittedly interesting plot of the Twilight Saga. From the very subtle and harmless (lack of swearing -understandably since it's a YA novel, but still-, Bella not drinking coffee) to major plot points like everything surrounding purity, abstinence (both blood-related and sexual), Bella's pregnancy and the birth of Renegade.

So a question popped in my mind: What do you think would have changed if a different author had had SM's idea of a Vampire-Human romance? While mostly maintaining the lore and plot, that is.

My first and foremost point is the protagonist.

I believe that a different author would've written Bella from a more nuanced, maybe realistic perspective. Bella is so unique, so different from all the other teenage girls that it's simply unrealistic and makes her feel one-dimensional. I know she's a parentified kid, an ""old-soul"" but that doesn't exempt her from having some of the issues most teenagers have. She never gets  zits? Period cramps? Never feels self conscious? Even during her depression she functions normally on her everyday life.

Edward mentions that Bella never acts/reacts the way he (a 104 year old man who can read minds) expects. How is it possible that he never came across someone remotely like her?

My second point is the genre. I think that SM could have been a little more audacious with the genre, maybe amp up the horror elements traditionally tied to vampires. Not the ""good ones"" of course, but the antagonists like James, Victoria and the Volturi. These are vampires! At no point whatsoever do you feel like they are an actual threat or they do something drastic to fulfill their role as ""villains"", except maybe for James attacking Bella. The newborns kill a bunch of people offscreen and it doesn't affect anyone. The Volturi are always kind of in the sidelines. No one Bella knows dies due to her connection to vampires. It's always a harmless threat. Bella doesn't suffer a single long lasting consequence of falling for Edward.

Anyway, let's discuss! Since religion is a point of discussion here, keep things respectful and civil.

1gez2nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1gez2nd/cost_breakdown_for_our_first_7_months_full_time/,Cost Breakdown for our first 7 months full time cruising last winter (31yo m/f 42' monohull),"People always ask how much cruising costs; so as we prepare to go into our second season cruising, here are the actual numbers from our first season of full time cruising last winter.  We are doing a 6 month on 6 month off schedule. This time frame is for 7 months, November 23’ through May 24’. We went from Jacksonville FL down the east coast to Miami then the Key West and the Dry Tortugas, and back to Jacksonville. There are two of us , M/F, 31 yo on an 80s era 42’ monohull. Everyone says that your first year or two are the most expensive because you are upgrading/fixing the boat, which I hope is the case here as well, but I would not be surprised if the annual upgrade/maintenance cost is around 10k every year (which checks out for a 100k boat). We do 95% of our own work on the boat.

Note, we bought the boat already in above average condition and was essentially turn key ready for the previous couple who were fairly minimalist. Despite that, we still spent the first 3 months living at the dock, fixing things to comply with insurance requirements, adding/upgrading things we decided we wanted to fit our needs for cruising, and generally just learning the boat before setting off. I was working full time during the first 2 months of the dock time/refit time so that certainly slowed it down. The few things not in this budget are personally variable like health insurance and IRA/401k contributions so those are left out. Notes on categories below:

https://preview.redd.it/z1lbfsa83qxd1.png?width=555&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f3665f2dda8533b12861e5a92e32d75a05e005

Bars: Self-explanatory, while this is essentially entertainment, it deserves its own category.

 Boat Maintenance: Everything from stain to the new anchor, electronics, motor oil to mechanic services. Of course this doesn’t smoothly average out, because most of the purchases are done in the beginning of the season. My estimate for this category was within 1k of the actual spend, so I was pretty close on my budget for this.

 Boat Maintenance – Misc: All the extra purchases that nickel and dime you while doing the boat projects. Paint brushes, tape, glue, an odd fitting here, some stainless screws, new tools, whatever. Interestingly, I estimated this figure at 15% of the repairs and upgrades category (which had a 10% padding already), and it was dead nuts on as well.

 Other Boat Purchases: Everything purchased to make the boat livable, such as seats, storage solutions, kitchen tools, bedding ect. This should go down substantially in the future as its more of a startup cost than an ongoing one.

 Coffee/Cafes: My girlfriend loves getting a coffee and working or reading; coffee shops are just an alternative place to work and get off the boat, so it got its own category.

 Diesel: Boat fuel

 Dinghy Gas: Self explanatory, though I am sure this category is undrerepresented since we would often get dinghy gas with diesel, and the two charges were combined on the receipt and they just got market as big boat fuel.

 Dining: Eating out at restaurants. We ate out while cruising more than we ever did at home. Going out to eat was something to do, and a nice treat/slice of normalcy when things were stressful. We’re cruising to experience new areas, not shut ourselves in the boat for the sake of saving every penny.

 Dockage/Mooring: We had a number of guests come with to start, and it just ended up that we stayed at some extra docks because of it. Whenever we had the option we would get a mooring ball, because in FL the only way to get to shore is usually dinghy docks which you have to pay for, and the price of dinghy dock access (but on anchor) with showers/water/trash is basically the same as if you’re on the mooring ball. And the mooring ball is closer, and just less stressful overall. They were all around $30/ night.

 Entertainment: Museums, trips, shows, park access ect

 Fishing/Diving/Toys: Buying or maintaining diving gear, fishing gear, or our bikes

 Flights: Flying to and from the boat (also flew home for Christmas)

 Grocery Stores: All of our food shopping for the two of us, and guests when they came. This also includes alcohol

 Insurance: Boat insurance

 Internet/Phone: We each have a cell phone, we had starlink that we used a few times, but mostly we had 5g cell service and unlimited data to work

 Lodging: land based lodging while doing the refit, or before flying out after putting the boat away for summer storage

 Other Subscriptions: Netflix, and things like that

 Personal Items/Clothing: Buying health items, souvenirs, gifts for friends, or clothes along the way such as sun shirts, sandals, foul weather gear, a back pack ect.

 Storage Fees: storing our car while cruising, and launching/hauling the boat at the beginning and end of the season. Not included is off season storage at 350/mo

 Transportation: Public transportation, ubers, rental car

 Vehicle Gas: While living at the dock for 3 months, driving all over the place picking up parts or running errands, buying food, sightseeing.

Has good seating and outlets for working

I don’t care about the noise seating and food is a priority (I want to spend my money if I’m going to sit there for a couple of hours)

October goal was to get to 187 and I’m considering my weigh-in today a win! I hit a week long plateau at 188 that I got past this morning. 

I was doing a 16:8 dirty fast for most of October and switched to 18:6 dirty fast for the last few days to get me off the plateau. (Still putting creamer in my coffee) Exercise has been sporadic lately but I usually walk a mile or two on my lunch break and occasionally do other light cardio. 

Next goal is to get to 182 by the end of November. I’ll update again then!

1geyrc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1geyrc6/new_to_oe_tips/,New to OE - Tips?,"Hi all, I’m a long time lurker of the sub. It’s going to be a long text so sorry about thatZ

 I graduated in March this year (non-tech) and worked remotely as an assistant at a small recruiting firm for 2 months, where I worked directly under the CEO. Before my trial period was over, I got an offer to work for a consulting firm in the field that I majored in, which is extremely hard in my country (out of 20 people I graduated with 10 work in call centers or other non related jobs). 

I’ve been really enjoying my job in consulting and the pay is good for a recent grad, and I do think this is what I want to align myself with. However my old boss from the recruiting job messaged me yesterday saying he has not been able to find a replacement for me, and is interested in me coming back.

Obviously I have the upper hand in this situation since he wants me back. What I’m wondering is how should I proceed? I checked my current contract and it states that I’m not to work two jobs without notifying the company, and that there can’t be a conflict of interest, which there isn’t. The assistant job is super simple, there was a time where I didn’t open my laptop for 2 weeks. 

The pay at my old job wasn’t great but the 2 jobs pilled together could easily make me a top earner in my country (3rd world). We agreed to meet up for coffee next month to discuss the possibility of my return. Since I have already worker for them I know the contracts they use and I’m pretty sure I can negotiate but they will have questions. 

I have the following questions, that maybe more seasoned OE professionals might be able to answer:
- Should I talk to the recruiting job and ask them to change the contract so they don’t pay social security since J1 does that? I did some research and if they both pay there is a 100% chance that J1 finds out. 
- Should I even tell them that I am not planning to quit J1? I think they will accept and move me to part time, which will still be income, but I want the FT pay lol
- Should I notify J1 at all? 

Please leave any suggestions you have. I really need the additional income and would appreciate any comments :) ",2,1730219191.0,overemployed,0,1.0,False

I am trying to get my life back together by building my social life ground up again, but as a second year college student, I'm finding it really hard.

Lots of friend groups are already solidly formed and many of our clubs require applications (go figure). I'm also slightly embarrassed about being .. lonely? And I take refuge occasionally in the cozy spots outside the Yale bubble.

I enjoy hikes and runs to East Rocks, grabbing coffee, and reading. I would love to meet some people over for a walk / hike to East Rock and we can do work at a nearby cafe or bookstore. I've been to Atticus, The Graduate, Koffee? .. but I really want to branch out.

I also enjoy cooking but it's a hell of a process to use our student kitchen here (register 48 hours in advance, etc). It would be fun to cook with someone. I really wish having a normal relationship with food in general, haha.

Not sure if this is allowed to be posted or not...I spent 7 weeks in your city and ended up making a full album (90s style techno if you will) and the entire album came to life/was inspired by your amazing city, so much that I titled the album, Seulement à Marseille and all of the tracks on the albums were from places and events in your city.

Background: live and work in music in Berlin and upon meeting a tattoo artist from Marseille in the basement of a factory for an underground art event, he mentioned he was from Marseille and how he loved the city. Needing a bit of a change from Berlin I came to Marseille for what I thought was going to be a week or 2 and to explore your city's music scene....fast forward to 7 weeks later and entire full LP,  Marseille is such an incredible city.

I had heard Marseille had a bit of a reputation and some crime related things, but I never experienced any of that in my entire time I was there. Never once did I feel unsafe or in any dangerous situations.

The thing that struck me the most about your city were the people. So many different types of people and a lot of them were so damn friendly. It was really great meeting people who were born in Marseille, or from other parts of France, or even Algeria and Morocco, and how it all melted together. I met some really fantastic people and made some amazing friendships. I also do not speak french, but during my time there I felt that I should try and learn a bit (how to order food, coffee, say how are you etc) and everyone was super encouraging and helpful.

Your music scene, although on the smaller side in terms of quantity, was really fantastic. I spent many nights at L'Intermédiaire which is such a great venue. I love that every night is a different style of music and the open mic nights for jazz had some of the best musicians I have ever seen.

Coming from Berlin, I was also impressed by one of your techno collectives, Metaphore. They put on some really great events and are doing a great job trying to create a scene in Marseille.

Most of the album I actually mixed and rewrote at Le Champ De Mars. I know this can be a bit of a touristy spot sometimes on the weekends, but in the mornings, the staff were so friendly especially the owner Solomon, hopefully I spelled that correctly. It was always fun having their cafe cat, Januz come over and say hi as well.

You all have some great spots for sunrises and sunsets. Spent several nights up on the hill at the church watching the sunset, and that pizza place La Bonne Mere was fantastic(actually your city has a ridiculously strong pizza game which I was not expecting at all).  In the mornings I would grab a croissant and head to the area around Le Maregraphe and just look out at the ocean or listen to the previous night's recordings.

Your city is absolutely amazing and I fell in love with it. Cheers from Berlin

Track titles from the album from the city - Vieux Port, Quartier de createurs, Noailles to nowhere, Metaphore, Le Champ de Mars, L'Intermediarie, Le Style Marseille, Refelxions.

I ended up writing a letter which was placed in the vinyl record, since most people dont speak french here in Berlin, I thought I would post a picture of it as you all can understand it.
