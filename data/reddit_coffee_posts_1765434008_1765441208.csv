1pjscc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheOpossumguy/comments/1pjscc2/working_on_an_ai/,Working on an AI,"On 04 December 2025, I started building an AI because of a surreal dream that shook me awake. In the dream, my AI gently woke me with: “Good morning, sir. Today is [date], 0700 hours. I’ve started the coffee and disarmed the house. Here’s your news brief…”

As I moved through the house, the AI followed me—fluid, aware, almost alive—feeding me live updates, reminders, and information as if it had always been part of my daily routine. When I got dressed and asked, “How do I look?” it answered without hesitation: “The pants and boots work well, but swap the shirt for your black button-up and pair it with a dress jacket.”

Before I left, it seamlessly linked to my car and pushed traffic conditions, local alerts, and anything else I needed for the day.

When I actually woke up—around 04:30 AM—the dream was still burning in my mind, so I sat down and started building. No plan, no training, just momentum.

I’ve hit roadblocks since then, sure, but the vision hasn’t faded. And considering I had no formal Python background, I’m proud of how far the project has come. Every step forward has been pure grit, curiosity, and the refusal to let the idea die.",1,1765441153.0,u_TheOpossumguy,0,0.99,False

Lo and behold, a familiar melody merged together with Tyler Hyde’s voice. 

It’s highly likely it’s just from a sad indie playlist they pulled off Spotify, but it’s cool to hear Adrianne’s older discography in a random coffeeshop, let alone one of my favourites from Hours Were the Birds. The whole album itself is such a beautiful project even though I’d probably never get to hear those songs live.

I’ve recently been trying to make my diet a bit cleaner, and one thing I wanted to replace was **refined white sugar**. I came across **desi khand**, which is an unrefined, more natural form of sugar, and I’m honestly surprised more people don’t talk about it.

Here’s what I liked about it so far:

* It’s **less processed**
* It has a **rich caramel-like flavour**
* It’s **chemical-free** (no bleaching agents like refined sugar)
* Works amazingly in **chai, coffee, halwa, kheer, laddoos**, etc.
* Feels *lighter* on the stomach

If anyone is planning to switch, I found a genuine online source that sells pure desi khand — not the fake “brown sugar” most markets sell:  
👉 [https://desikhand.in/](https://desikhand.in/)

ANYWAY… I’m planning to start drinking decaf tomorrow to see if it will make a difference. I wanted to chat to anyone else that has attempted this mission specifically for anxiety relief.

The staff were nice, but a lot of the basic room amenities just… weren’t there or didn’t work:
	•	No microwave in the room, and none available on the floor
	•	The little freezer section in the fridge didn’t work at all
	•	Coffee maker didn’t function (always a rough start to the morning)
	•	Our room for three adults had one real bath towel — the rest were tiny kiddie/face towels
	•	The pillows were small, lumpy throw pillows instead of actual sleeping pillows
	•	No vending machines anywhere on site, so even getting water was inconvenient

None of these things are huge on their own, but together they made the stay feel way below what I expect from a major hotel brand.

Meanwhile, Hilton — even Tru — consistently gives me the basics done right: working appliances, real pillows, full towels, and amenities that actually function. It’s reliable, and that matters.

After this experience, I’m definitely sticking with Hilton. I don’t mind driving a few extra minutes if it means I’ll actually be comfortable the whole stay.

No one I know has an account, yet I will not be naming names regardless, so rest assured to anyone reading this.

I (33F) live in Autralia (born and raised), live as a single disabled (CRPS diagnosed 2014) mum to a beautiful boy (2), we will call him R.

I have 2 brothers, J(21M) and C(18M). J and C live with our parents (53F and 57M) a 15-20 minute drive away. I moved out because of a situation that needs its own reddit post to explain, fair to say it was that difficult that it has strained the relationship between myself and our Mum, myself and J. It also affects the quality and frequency of communication and visitations between myself and C and Dad.

The initial 9 months after I moved out in 2010, I was not allowed to contact, visit or even just talk to Dad, J and C, J and C were 6 and 3 years old at the time. It was roughly 2 months after I left that I turned 18. I saw Dad at my 18th Birthday lunch with family at the local pub, but Mum kept J and C home with her. Dad spent a good year and a half sneaking in to visit me over the next 18 months, he could never bring J and C. It was heartbreaking.

For years even after communications were allowed and I could schedule visits ahead of time or call Dad at least, I was never told about major events until after they happened by Mum and she was gleeful and always pretended in was a normal everyday thing. The shows and end of year celebrations, family events at schools, school graduations. All of it.

Mum only opened communications after I got my licence in 2011 because she wanted to go to a Cousins wedding. She asked me to look after their house and feed the animals (at the time 2 dogs) while they were gone because my Cousin lives in a different state and they had to fly there.

Mum asked me to do this 2 months before. As is her habit she puts any event coming up on the fridge in the week lead up and I visited 3 days before they were due to leave for the weekend. Mum asked me to make everyone a cuppa (coffee), while the kettle was boiling I was looking at the fridge waiting before getting the milk. There it was the wedding invite. And on it the invite was addressed to Mum, Dad, J, C and [my name]. I immediately confronted my mum who basically said ""So? It's not like you could afford to go anyway. I just decided you would be of more help feeding the dogs and watching the house.

I am a confrontational person, I grew out of people pleasing quickly. I hold these instances to account as they happen. I have gone LC to NC with our Mum everytime they happen. Everytime that happens, she spins her own tale of how I said something that upset her and I need to apologise, yeah everyone knows someone like this.

LC is default setting because at first because of J and C, now because of R. Children should never be stuck or used in adult problems. Period.

So the lastest incidents. Yes, that was all just background to give a general idea of the history without giving away too many details.

So last year my youngest brother C graduated from Secondary School. In a behaviour true to form, Mum didn't discuss C's Graduation coming up until a week and a half before. Mum had forgotten she had not told me and randomly started venting about it on a call. Complaining about the limit of tickets (school had limited the attendees due to the size of the venue, 4 tickets per student, so 4 people per student to watch the graduation.), she complained about the price of the tickets, about having to buy formal clothes, about having to buy dinner and the prices of the venue etc.

I latched onto the 4 tickets, thinking all of us could go, Dad, Mum, J and I. Schools dont tend to worry about some one with an infant, you don't generally pay for tickets for children under a certain age and R was 1 at the time. 
Mum's response when I got excited saying that ""I have a formal dress that I could wear and R's attire doesn't matter as much."" Mum shut it down immediately, she said; ""Oh, we thought it would be a bit much for you to come with R, the price of everything on top of how expensive nappies etc would be too much, so I discussed it with J and C and they decided that J's Girlfriend would get the ticket. And they all agreed to not tell you so that you wouldn't get upset.""

After the Graduation she called to gloat and complain about the graduation. ""It was a good ceremony, beautiful, the food was a bit pricey. You should be happy you didn't go, it was so cramped that you would not have gotten a pram in, no one could move.""

If all of you think that is suss, you are right on the money. She has mastered the ability to exclude in a socially acceptable way that doesn't raise any eyebrows. Whilst all the while making decisions in everyone's best interest.

Now, I understand, it has been this way all through J and C's lives and they are used to this happening. That I am only there Christmases, Birthdays and the odd barbecue that Mum or Dad actually tell me about. I managed to fluke a few good family moments by just being there at the right time without knowing something was planned, everyone thought I was told. (I go with the flow and immersed myself in and pretended it was normal and I wasn't surprised, made easier because I wasn't surprised when Mum claimed credit for telling me about it when she never did. I always remember that for J and C, this is the norm for them, they don't realise they are upsetting me if they forget to tell me about their parties or big events because Mum normally handles telling other people.

Well, as mentioned earlier in the post, J is now 21, he turned 21 in the last couple of days, like any normal person, I thought he would hold his party the weekend of his birthday week. I said no to invites and freed up my Saturday. The day before his birthday, I was on the phone to Mum we were updating each other on our children of discussion J and R. I said: ""J must be holding his 21st party this weekend.""
Mum perked right up on the other end of the phone and told me; ""No, it was last weekend just gone. J only invited a few close friends and they hung out and drank in his shed. Here I will send you a picture of the cake I made for J's 21st.""

She said it like that deliberately, J only invited friends and his Girlfriend to his 21st at their house. Here's the hitch, Mum, Dad, and C live with J. So J only inviting his friends and girlfriend means that attendies are those living at the property and the friends. Which means the only people from our immediate family that weren't invited to J's 21st was our maternal grandmother (the rest are passed on), myself (J's only sister) and my Son R (J's only nephew). 

I am between heartbroken, devastated and livid. I understand that J probably didn't think it would upset me or be abnormal to just not bother telling me, he rarely texts of calls and only visits on R's or my birthdays for maybe 5 minutes.

Am I Overreacting by refusing to see J and my Family and give J his 21st present until I calm down? I am sitting here trying to fathom how people think it is ok to exclude immediate family members from big events and milestones. So I turn to the internet for feedback. Is this normal? AIO? What would you do in my situation? Go through the motions, smile and pretend everything is fine?",1,1765440208.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

As a temporary fix I taped a food bag around the chrome outlet, assuming moisture was interfering with the touch panel, and that actually stopped the problem. But it’s hardly elegant.

1pjrzuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pjrzuf/i_got_taken_out_of_the_schedule_for_my_boba_job/,I got taken out of the schedule for my boba job,"Hey everyone I just wanted everyone's opinion on this situation I was recently in. I am not going to name the boba shop I worked for but basically I wanted a fun, cutesy job over the summer because I had free time and I wanted to make a little extra cash before going to school. So one day I asked my brother for a ride to take me from my first job to my second job. So to thank him I was going to make him and his wife boba to take home. I tell him to wait in the lobby for a minute while I make the drinks and also for my other coworker to come and relieve the morning shift because the people working in the morning was the owner's mom, and another new person. The new person leaves and I am working with the owner's mom in the meantime (They can only leave once a person of the same authority comes in: (i come in, new person can leave; manager comes in, morning manager can leave))

So the stores policy is that the person can get unlimited drinks while working but cannot give out any drinks. Since this is the case I make the drinks for my brother, but since it has already been 30 minutes and my other coworker still had not shown up I decided to give it to him anyway and make the ticket for the drinks later on when we were not in a rush. I had already prepared the drinks and so I bagged them up and gave them to my brother and he went on his marry way. After that I took an order from a guy who works in the store next to us and he asked for two coffee lattes with boba, the owners mom comes out from the kitchen and hears this order and starts making it. I mistakenly rang him up for one drink. So I come back into the kitchen to help make their drinks but there was only one ticket.

The owner's mom is confused why there was only one ticket and I tried to tell her it was a mistake but she didn't understand me. So she calls one of my other managers to translate for her and she talks to her for a bit explaining what had happened (im assuming) and hands me the phone. I tell her my side and that I rang up the customer's order wrong and she reminds that I am not able to give out drinks for me. I tell her I know that, but since the guy left already I am happy to cover the other drink for him instead and I won't do it again. We continue you talking and I clarified that I made 3 drinks. 2 for my brother and the other drink for the guy. So I hand the phone back to the owner's mom and she talks a bit more more to her and she hands me back the phone and tells me to make a ticket for the 2 drinks I made for my family and give it to the owner's mom. So I did and she takes a picture of it and my other coworker shows up and she leaves.

Later on that week, I am expecting my schedule for the week to come out and I find that I am completely cleared off the schedule and a long post from the owner reminding everyone of the rules.

I realize that it was wrong for me to give my brother the drinks but I feel like it shouldn't have warranted me to be taken off the schedule....",2,1765439809.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1pjrz4g,https://i.redd.it/wut7hfwl6j6g1.jpeg,"Hey, My Star Quarterback—Enjoying the View from the Bench? Your Little Backup Girl Just Claimed the MVP Crown","The second Nathon's words sank in, it was like someone ripped the ground out from under me.


My chest went tight. My hands went numb. It felt like drowning—but worse, because I was still standing there, still breathing, still forced to hear him.


No wonder he'd been dodging my eyes all damn day.


After I kept pushing—demanding answers—he finally cracked and admitted it. He'd lied. Straight to my face. And then he had the audacity to stand there and justify it like it was no big deal.


But Common App had locked an hour ago. There was no fixing this. No going back.


I still couldn't process it. My voice came out shaky, barely holding together:


""Even if Harper didn't want us at the same school—why couldn't she change her application?


""If she wanted to stay in New York so bad, there are dozens of other schools. Why the hell did you have to trick me into going to Miami?""


Nathon's face twitched. He shifted his weight—still in his grass-stained practice jersey, his duffel bag slung over one shoulder like he'd just come from the field. Out of habit, he reached out to mess with my hair, that stupid move he always pulled when he thought I was overreacting.


I slapped his hand away.


His jaw tightened. He pulled back, rubbing the back of his neck like I was the one being difficult.


""Alina, come on. Don't blow this out of proportion.


""Everyone knows Harper's had her heart set on NYU since forever. She's not giving that up.


""So why are you being so stubborn about this? You spent days going back and forth on your decision anyway—it's not like you were dead set on NYU.""


I laughed. A harsh, bitter sound that didn't even sound like me.


Oh, so my dream doesn't matter?


""I worked my ass off for that score. I earned it. Why shouldn't I apply to NYU?


""Does her family own the damn school? Is NYU only accepting one student this year?


""If she's so special, maybe she should get them to close applications to everyone but her!""


Nathon's expression darkened. His fingers drummed impatiently against his gym bag strap—the same restless tic he had before a big game. But this wasn't a game. This was my life.


""Alina, stop twisting this into something it's not.


""She was trying to avoid drama, okay? NYU's campus is tiny. She didn't want you two running into each other constantly and making things worse. I figured this way, everyone wins.


""And anyway, she applied first. You were still waffling about it for days, so clearly you weren't that sure.


""But Harper? She only applied to one school. She didn't have a backup. You really gonna tank her shot at college over this?""


Something inside me snapped.


My voice cracked, louder than I meant it to—almost hysterical:


""I was being careful because I was weighing all my options! That doesn't mean I didn't want it!


""And who the hell gets into NYU and just—doesn't go?!


""And you, Nathon—""


My hands were shaking now. I could barely get the words out.


""Last night you sat there and convinced me we'd both switch to Miami. Together. You watched me submit it. You promised we'd go together.


""But then this morning you switched yours back to NYU and didn't say a word to me. Do you have any idea how that feels?!""


He exhaled sharply, like I was exhausting him. Like this whole conversation was cutting into his evening workout or something.


""I told you—I didn't plan that. My parents found out and lost their minds. They said I'm not leaving New York, especially not with a football scholarship on the table here. They switched it back before I could stop them.


""I was gonna tell you, I just—""


""But you didn't!"" My voice cracked again, embarrassingly close to breaking. ""You let the deadline pass. You let me sit there thinking we were in this together while you—""


I couldn't finish. My throat was too tight.


The silence between us felt suffocating.


Finally, Nathon let out this long, frustrated sigh—like I was the problem here. He adjusted the strap on his gym bag, glancing toward the parking lot like he had somewhere better to be.


""Alina, look. Harper doesn't have your grades. She barely scraped by with cheer captain bonus points to get into NYU. Without that, she wouldn't have made it at all.


""Can't you just... let her have this?""


There it was.


Let her have this.


That phrase. Again.


My heart shattered.


I stared at him—this guy I'd known since we were kids, who I thought had my back no matter what—and realized he didn't see me at all.


He saw an inconvenience. A problem. Someone making a fuss over nothing.


He saw her—Harper, in her cheer uniform, laughing at his jokes after practice, always there on the sidelines cheering him on.


And me? I was just... in the way.


My voice came out barely above a whisper, but it cut through the air like glass:


""You're seriously telling me to throw away my future because you don't want to upset your girlfriend's best friend?


""You lied to me, Nathon. You manipulated me. You gambled with my entire future like it was some kind of joke—and you don't even think you did anything wrong.""


He opened his mouth to argue, but I didn't let him.


""Fifteen years, Nathon. Fifteen years I thought you'd always have my back.


""But I guess I was wrong.""


Chapter 2


The past two years ever since Harper Parker showed up, everything between Nathon and me had crumbled.


Every inside joke we used to have. Every comfortable silence. Every moment where I thought we just got each other—gone.


And the thing he said most, over and over, until I could recite it in my sleep?


""Just let her have this.""


It started small.


""Harper just transferred into our class. She doesn't have many friends yet. You should cut her some slack.""


Then it escalated.


""Harper's scared to walk home alone after study hall. We're heading that way anyway—can't you just deal with the detour?""


And then it got ridiculous.


""Harper didn't understand this problem during class. She just needs to sit at your desk for one study period. Is that really something to get mad about?""


...


Every. Single. Time.


And I tried—God, I tried—to be reasonable about it.


But here's the thing:


Harper had plenty of friends. Her cheer squad practically worshipped her. I couldn't walk past them in the hallway without getting ice-cold stares and whispered comments I wasn't supposed to hear.


Her family had a driver who picked her up and dropped her off every single day. She didn't even need anyone to walk her home.


And her desk partner? She hated me. So whenever Harper decided she needed Nathon's help during study hall, she'd slide into my seat like she owned it—leaving me standing there like an idiot with nowhere to sit.


I'd end up squeezed awkwardly at my best friend's desk, trying to study while they laughed and whispered two feet away. Her perfume would still be lingering at my desk when I finally got it back.


But every time I tried to bring any of this up—calmly, rationally—Nathon made me feel like I was the one being unreasonable.


His tone would shift. From casual and dismissive, to serious and patronizing, to outright irritated.


""Alina, I'm not your personal property. You need to stop being so possessive.""


And the worst part?


After hearing it enough times, I started believing him.


Maybe I was too sensitive. Too jealous. Too selfish.


Maybe he really was just being a good class president—helping out a teammate who needed support.


Maybe the problem wasn't him.


Maybe it was me.


I started second-guessing every feeling I had. Every time my chest tightened when he laughed at one of Harper's jokes. Every time my stomach dropped when he chose to sit with her at lunch instead of me.


I told myself I was overreacting. That I needed to grow up.


But now?


Now my entire future—my dream school, the one I'd sacrificed sleep and sanity for—had been ripped away from me because of her.


Because Nathon decided her happiness mattered more than mine.


Because apparently, fifteen years of friendship meant nothing compared to keeping Harper Parker comfortable.


My throat burned. My vision blurred.


I thought about all the late nights we'd spent studying together. All the times he'd walked me home when I was scared. All the promises we'd made about sticking together no matter what.


And he'd thrown it all away.


For her.


Not even for her, really—for the idea of her. For the way she looked at him after practice. For the way she made him feel like a hero.


I wasn't worth that.


My dreams? My future? My feelings?


None of it mattered.


The realization hit me like a physical blow.


I'd been so stupid.


All this time, I thought we were best friends. I thought he cared about me the way I cared about him.


But I was just... there. Convenient. Familiar.


And the second someone more interesting came along, I became disposable.


My hands were shaking. My chest ached so badly I could barely breathe.


I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and make him see what he'd done.


But what would be the point?


He didn't think he'd done anything wrong.


He still thought I was overreacting. That I'd calm down in a few days and everything would go back to normal.


That I'd forgive him. Again.


Like I always did.


But not this time.


This time, something inside me had broken. And I didn't think it could be fixed.


I took a shaky breath, forcing myself to steady.


I didn't look at Nathon. Didn't give him the satisfaction of seeing how much this hurt.


I just turned around and walked out of the school.


Chapter 3


I couldn't stop crying the whole way home.


Fifteen years. I'd known Nathon for fifteen years.


And never ever did I think he'd lie to me for someone else.


Especially not about something that would destroy my entire future.


My phone buzzed. A string of frantic messages from my best friend, Bonnie Clark.


【What the hell? Did your boy Nathon just go official with that Miss Cheerleader??】


My heart stopped.


Before I could even process it, another message popped up.


A screenshot. From Harper's Instagram.


Posted fifteen minutes ago—right after Common App locked.


【The school I've dreamed about since I was ten... and someone who moved mountains to make sure we'd get there together. 】


The post had three pictures.


One was Harper in her cheer uniform, all glowing skin and perfect beach waves.


The other two were cropped screenshots of acceptance letters—carefully framed so you could see the NYU logo but not the full names.


Except I didn't need to see the names.


I recognized the major on one of them immediately.


It was Nathon's.


The post was dripping with that coy, look-at-us energy—the kind where she wanted everyone to know without actually saying it outright.


And the comments?


A flood of heart emojis and congratulations.


""OMG you two!! ""


""Couple goals already and you're not even there yet.""


""This is so cute I'm gonna CRY""


""You guys are gonna be THAT campus couple, I'm calling it now""


And Nathon?


He'd liked it.


Not just liked it—he'd commented too.


A single emoji. A smirking face.


Like this was all some fun little game.


Oh.


So that's how it was.


I was the joke. The punchline.


The girl who thought she mattered.


My chest caved in on itself. The pain was so sharp I had to stop walking, one hand pressed against a lamppost just to stay upright.


All this time I thought we were something.


Not dating, maybe. But something.


I thought the late-night study sessions meant something. The inside jokes. The way he'd text me first thing in the morning. The way he knew my coffee order by heart.


I thought when he said ""we,"" he meant us.


But he didn't.


He never did.


I was just... there.


A placeholder.


The backup plan.


The safe option he kept around while he waited for someone better to notice him.


And the second Harper looked his way?


I became invisible.


No—worse than invisible.


I became the obstacle.


The annoying third wheel who didn't know when to leave.


My throat burned.


My vision blurred so badly I could barely see the street in front of me.


I thought back to last night.


The way Nathon had shown up at my door, eyes bright, practically vibrating with excitement.


He grabbed my hands and held them tight, looking at me like I was the only person in the world who could help him.


""Alina, listen. I need you to do this with me. I can't do it alone.""


He said he wanted to be brave. To finally break free from his parents' suffocating expectations. That going far away—together—was the only way he'd have the guts to do it.


And I believed him.


God, I was so stupid.


I hesitated at first. Of course I did.


NYU was my dream too. I'd worked myself to exhaustion for that acceptance letter.


And staying local wasn't just convenient—it was necessary. My family couldn't afford out-of-state tuition. Staying in New York meant I could live at home, save money, maybe even help out with my little brother's expenses.


I'd never even considered leaving.


But Nathon wouldn't let it go.


He grabbed my hand tighter, his voice dropping to that soft, pleading tone that always made my defenses crumble.


""Please, Alina. I can't do this without you.""


His eyes were so intense. So desperate.


And I—like the pathetic, lovesick idiot I was—couldn't say no.


So I broke.


I gave in.


I changed my application to Miami, thinking we'd be doing this together.


Thinking it meant something.


But it didn't.


It never did.


He just needed me out of the way so Harper could have her fairy-tale moment.


And I handed it to him on a silver platter.


My knees buckled. I sank down onto the curb, phone still clutched in my shaking hand.


The truth crashed over me in waves, each one more suffocating than the last.


Fifteen years of friendship.


Fifteen years of being there for him.


And all of it—all of it—had been one-sided.


I was never his best friend.


I was his entertainment. His ego boost. The girl who'd always be there, no questions asked, no matter how badly he treated me.


And the worst part?


I'd let him.


I'd spent years running toward him, thinking someday he'd see me the way I saw him.


But he never did.


And he never would.


I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to stop the tears, but they just kept coming.

1pjrxb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1pjrxb8/tifu_by_switching_my_bosss_coffee/,TIFU by switching my boss's coffee?,".Two weeks ago my boss (43m) sent me (27m) an email which I found out later he sent to the rest of the office. He made us aware that the coffee brand the company buys us is no longer being provided. We all got quite enraged as the brand we are given isn't even expensive (around $6 per 100g) we are not a big company with about 15 staff total. We have each tried to make attempts to persuade him against it but he really won't budge.

After a week with a completely coffee-less staff thing started to get tense, many pointed out that this simple purchase made the office staff feel more like a joint team in a way. but no matter what we said he wouldn't budge on his stance. Me and my roommate (28m) who we will call mathew, decided it was time to be petty.

For some background our boss drinks EXPENSIVE coffee and has never let anyone taste it before. I've found out it's about 100ish nz dollars 57ish USD for his instant coffee(he buys it online). He constantly raves about his ""perfectly smooth instant coffee” and we all have become sick of it. Me and Mathew went to the supermarket and brought a tub of what we'd normally be provided and waited for my next shift. Our shift starts don't line up so it was all on me to complete what we called the great coffee hist. 

On Monday I came into work 20 minutes before he was scheduled to arrive and snuck into his office and switched the coffee. It was a fresh container. By the looks of it he had only had one drink. I switched the coffee powder labels between the containers, so he believed that i had brought in my own one from home but really i took his… this only worked because he would top our coffee up in one of his old containers because it came in a bag.

Later that morning i went in to conveniently chat to him to see how the coffee was treating him and it turns out HE LOVED IT. He told me that he didn't know what happened, but it got better overnight!! I had to practically run out of there to stop myself from laughing in his face.

I found Matthew to tell him what happened and him and the other colleagues around were dubbed over in laughter. But some kept calling me a jerk. This lead me to think that i may have made a grave mistake.

TL;DR: today i made a mistake by switching my bosses coffee ",0,1765439523.0,tifu,3,0.17,False

1pjrttz,https://www.reddit.com/r/phhorrorstories/comments/1pjrttz/intramuros_resto/,Intramuros Resto,"There is a very special (para sa akin at sa asawa ko) na restaurant sa Intramuros. Katabi ito ng isang government office where people often make reklamo against other people, and the mandate of that office is to seek peaceful resolutions para di na magkasuhan nang tuluyan mga parties. Sa resto na iyon madalas nagaganap ang mga aregluhan, and boy o boy bilang abugado and bilang anak ng isang ordinaryong manggagawa do I have not-ghost stories to tell about that government office and the deals that happen habang may araw pa sa resto na iyon.

Pero all that is from brunch to lunch to afternoon snacks. Pag gabi, that restaurant becomes something else. Romantic, even. They even have a bunch of old Tatangs who can serenade you in Filipino, English, and Spanish. 

Few days ago may hearing ako ng hapon sa government office na iyon. As usual the usual, iyakan, settlement, pirmahan. Naresolve ko yung kaso, and hindi naman masyadong masalimuot, marami lang papeles at iyakan. Natapos kami mga bago mag-5 pm, so naisip ko, maghapunan na lang kami mag-asawa sa resto sa tabi ng government office na iyon. 

So nauna ako sa resto. Umorder ako ng cake at kape, at dahil akala ng resto sa cafe lang ako, doon ako sa left side ng resto katabi ng cakes and coffee machine. 

Habang hinihintay ko yung cake at kape ko, nagsimula na akong mag-sort ng mga papeles mula sa kaso ko, kasi isang bundle na unsorted mula sa photocopier ang inabot sa akin ng complainant. Biglang may kumalabit sa akin. 

Eh wala namang nasa likod ko o nasa tabi. The nearest humans were the waiter a few meters away, and some lawyer-looking people na may marami ring papeles a few tables away. 

So di ko pinansin. 

Dumating yung cake ko at kape, and naramdaman ko pagod at gutom. I wolfed down yung cake, pero may pangalawa na namang kalabit. 

Ampocha, I said to myself, I refuse. Naiinis ako sa paperwork kasi ang liit ng font ng mga ebidensya na binigay sakin, iyon ang mas gusto kong isipin. 

Mga bago mag-6 pm, dumating ang asawa ko. Wala na yung ibang mga abugado, ang tao na lang doon was yung waiter at ako, and pinalipat niya kami sa mas malawak na left side ng resto. Doon daw ang lunch/dinner room talaga. Syempre ok sa’min mag-asawa iyon. 

Let me tell you, that resto transforms from a random resto sa tabi ng govt office pag may araw, to a wonderfully romantic old-world resto worthy of Intramuros and all the awards it got pag gabi. Romantic lights, hardwood furniture, and the band. The food is not bad—not the best din naman pero the ambiance is worth it. Habang umoorder ang asawa ko, may kaluskos sa left side ko. Parang soft screech. I tried to ignore it. 

Nag-usap kami mag-asawa. Mga the usual topics namin, how his day was, yung non-confidential aspects ng hearing ko, yung tindi ng traffic mula sa Makati hanggang Maynila. Sa pagitan ng usapan namin, yung empty space sa left side ko, may screech. 

The head waiter kept coming to our table, asking how our food was. Madedelay daw main course namin, so he offered soup on the house. We accepted. Then, a few minutes after maserve sa’min yung main course, the band came to us and sang songs we liked—we asked for some old Spanish songs. 

Saka ko lang napansin, kami lang ang kumakain sa resto na iyon. So maybe that was why ganoon ka-special ang treatment sa’min. 

After the bad left, bumalik yung screech. At this point, napansin na ng asawa ko na may napapansin ako sa empty space sa tabi ko. He asked if I was feeling something. Worse, he asked in Spanish. I glared at him, telling him, wag in Spanish, please. And pwede ba kami mag-Starbucks or Mcdonalds or kahit ano bago umuwi, kahit ano kahit saan, basta huwag derecho uwi. Naintindihan naman niya. 

Bumalik kami sa pagkain namin. Good paella. Not a lot of restos can do good paella, even if medyo ok lang ang other dishes nila. We went there for the paella anyway.

Nung nakalabas na kami ng Intramuros, kinwento ko na sa asawa ko yung pangagalabit at panggugulo nung entity. Nag-offer siya mag-MOA since hanggang 10pm doon, and it was still 7pm pa lang. After namin magpark, umikot kami sa showroom ng Ikea, and doon ko sinabi sa kanya that in many years, no entity has tried so hard to capture my attention so badly. The last was perhaps 2019, nung nagbubukas ng pinto (the knob turned on its own at nagbabalibag after a certain hour, and I told it to stop). 

My clairvoyant aunt told me that me actually asking something of that entity was very risky. Pero that one time I communicated (or attempted to) with it, hindi naman ako hinarass or sinundan, it just wanted me to stop spending time at the office beyond 9pm. 

Yung sa Intramuros yung medyo natakot ako kausapin (kahit hindi ako takot sa entity itself which might be foolish). Paano pag sumunod di ba. Kaya out of sheer desperation, and since mahilig naman maglakad asawa ko, talagang nilibot namin ang IKEA. 

I don’t feel it now. Siguro it remains sa resto na iyon. I don’t want to think na kaya may special treatment sa amin sa resto is because I sensed their spirit dweller, kasi the more practical reason is that kami lang ang patron at that hour. 

If you’ll ask me, babalik ba ako sa resto na iyon? I don’t see why not. My job takes me to that government office every so often, siguro once every quarter or so, and that resto is the only nice spot sa Intramuros na di ko kailangan lakarin nang malayo. And besides, ang dami naming romantic memories ng asawa ko doon. It’s just so unnerving somewhat na ngayon lang may nag-bother sa akin doon, in my many years of visiting that resto.

1pjrpus,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pjrpus/high_moral_standards/,high moral standards,"I find it stupid how some people use their personal experiences, whether a tragic event or a trauma, as a justification to impose their opinion on topics related or unrelated to it, that having suffered “more” than others gives them a higher moral standard and automatically makes them absolutely right, even on topics that are completely unrelated.

I know it sounds completely irrational if you just read the text. Of course, in simple situations it makes sense to give someone the benefit of the doubt if they’ve already experienced something, for example, asking a friend, “Which flavor do you recommend?” before getting a coffee, because they have prior experience about which tastes better.

But when it comes to more serious topics, like for example, suicide, it’s different. Having suicidal thoughts can be relatively common in adolescence due to emotional changes, social pressure, or even more trivial things like academic stress or family problems. (Still, just because it’s common doesn’t mean it should be ignored, nor should anyone assume that everyone who experiences it is faking it or seeking attention. If someone goes through these thoughts repeatedly, they should talk to family, friends, or a trusted adult)

But what I mean is that some people after going through something difficult, exaggerate their problems and use that experience as an excuse to impose their opinion, saying things like, “Hey, I went through this and you didn’t.” It’s as if they believe that simply having suffered gives them the right to be correct in any conversation, even if the topic has nothing to do with their experience.

And the problem is that this attitude appears in all kinds of situations, not only with topics like suicide, but also with relationships, family issues, mental health disorders, financial struggles, and even politics. Some people weaponize their past as if it were a credential that places them above everyone else. They turn their suffering into a badge that supposedly grants them automatic authority, and if you dare disagree, they treat it as disrespect or ignorance. It becomes less about healing or sharing their story and more about using that story to silence others.

There’s a difference between speaking from experience and using experience as a form of dominance. The first can be valuable, helpful, and even comforting. The second is manipulative, because it shuts down discussion and reduces other people’s perspectives to nothing, as if only those who have suffered deserve to speak. This mindset not only limits conversations but also prevents genuine understanding, since it assumes that pain alone equals truth. Suffering can shape a person’s point of view, sure, but it doesn’t make them the absolute owner of reality

I’m 30m and working from home today, so I figured it might be a good time to meet some new people (also kill boredom and make the time pass). I’m into sports, tattoos, music, interior design and just keeping things positive and relaxed.

I’ve lived in Berlin, Istanbul and Copenhagen, and I studied in Spain as well. In total I’ve lived in over five countries and speak four languages. I’m left wing, open minded and pretty easy to talk to. I’ve also been in a poly and open relationship before, so I’m understanding of different lifestyles and perspectives.

I collect vinyls and play guitar, harmonica and a bit of synthesizer. I love 35mm film photography. I’m more of a tea person than a coffee person. I’m 180 cm and thinking about switching from lifting to calisthenics. I’m a big dog person and love animals in general.

I also have a couple of slightly annoying opinions: I honestly think non-alcoholic cocktails are a scam, and I still don’t understand how indoor plants manage to die when we’re literally living through global warming and all they need is a bit of water now and then.

I am working from home today and I have finished my tasks earlier than I expected. That's why I am up for a chat. If needed, can also jump to Discord, Telegram etc.

Probably noone would read it but anyways, come say hi with a song rec!

I applied for a Software Engineer job at Meta (Facebook) early 2025 through their website, feeling pumped with my background – CS degree from a good school, two years at a mid-sized tech place building web apps, and some personal projects like a social media app clone. Got a referral from a buddy there, thought that'd help.



Started with an online coding test: three problems on HackerRank, easy stuff like arrays to medium graphs. Nailed it, submitted fast, felt good. Two weeks later, recruiter calls – phone screen set up. Guy was nice, talked about my resume, projects, why Meta. Then coding: longest substring without repeats. Used sliding window, explained it well, handled weird cases. Thought it rocked, but they said 'we'll see.'



Weeks go by, then onsite invite to Menlo Park. Super excited, flew out, hotel, prepped hard – system design, behavioral, whiteboard practice. Day comes: six interviews, 45 mins each, back-to-back.



First: Coding with senior. LRU cache. Coded in Python, hashmap and linked list, O(1) ops. He liked it, asked about threads.



Second: System design. Instagram feed. High level: users, posts, follows. Load balancers, servers, sharded DBs, NoSQL, Redis cache, Kafka queues. Talked scale, consistency, trade-offs. Intense af.



Third: Behavioral. 'Tough teammate story.' Told one from last job, how I fixed it. 'Why Meta?' Their world-connecting mission.



Fourth: Coding. N-Queens. Backtracking, pruning, clean code. Time complexity chat.



Fifth: Lunch with three engineers. Hobbies, work style, contributions. They talked ads, AI moderation. Felt real, but maybe not.



Sixth: Hiring manager. Career goals, leadership, culture fit. Failures and lessons.



Left wiped out but hopeful. Campus cool – free eats, gym, coffee. Two weeks later, rejection: 'Thanks, but no.' Crushed me. Thought I killed it, but design maybe weak, or fit off. Meta's bar is crazy high, want perfection. Learned a ton on design and interviews. Gonna try again in six months with more exp.

1pjro2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pjro2n/theophobia/,Theophobia,"Do you think animals believe in their own gods?
I stared at those words on my computer screen until they blurred. It was past midnight. The question sat there in my inbox like something alive, waiting.

I know this may sound crazy, but I’ve witnessed it firsthand. I’ve lost someone to this event—this phenomenon. Please respond. I can’t sleep. I can’t make sense of this. I need help. Please help. I’m just a sheep farmer and I need somebody to help me understand. Please reply. Please Dr. Grant, help me. 
—Charlie Saunders

My hand hovered over the keyboard. Animals with their own gods? My first instinct was to delete it—some teenager’s creative writing exercise, maybe. A prank. But then I saw the name again. Charlie Saunders. I knew Charlie. I’d been to his farm twice before, consulted on his flock’s behavior. He was the kind of man who measured his words carefully, who didn’t speak unless he had something worth saying. The kind of man who would never, never, send an email like this.
Unless something had broken him.

I wrote back immediately, told him to come to my office in the morning. He responded within the hour. Just three words: I’ll be there. I’m an ethologist. I study animal behavior—how they think, how they feel, what drives them. It’s all chemicals and instinct, evolution and adaptation. There’s no room for gods in that equation. No room for the supernatural. At least, that’s what I told myself.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that question burning behind my eyelids: Do animals believe in their own gods? By the time dawn broke, I’d convinced myself it was nothing. Stress. Grief, maybe. Charlie had probably lost a family member and wasn’t processing it well. I’d talk him through it, recommend a therapist, and that would be that. I was wrong.

Charlie was already waiting when I arrived at my office. I almost didn’t recognize him. The man I’d met before had been robust, energetic—someone who smiled easily and often. The thing slouched against my office door barely resembled him. His beard was unkempt, more white than I remembered. His eyes were sunken deep into purple-black hollows, the whites shot through with burst capillaries. He looked like he’d aged ten years in the few months since I’d seen him. Like something had reached inside him and scooped out everything vital.
“Dr. Grant,” he said. His voice was a rasp, like he’d been screaming. “Good morning.”
“Charlie.” I tried to keep my voice steady as I unlocked the door. “How long have you been waiting?” He didn’t answer. Just shuffled inside when I opened the door, moving like his bones hurt.

I flicked on the lights—the fluorescent bulbs hummed and flickered before catching—and started the coffee maker. The familiar ritual did nothing to calm the crawling sensation up my spine. Something was very, very wrong. “The university looks good,” Charlie mumbled, staring at nothing. I poured him coffee with shaking hands. “Black, right?” A nod. Barely. I sat across from him and forced myself to look—really look—at what he’d become. His hands trembled around the cup. There were dirt stains under his fingernails. And his eyes… God, his eyes were the worst part. They had the hollow, haunted quality of someone who’d seen something they could never unsee.
“Charlie, what happened—” His fist slammed into my desk so hard the coffee jumped in our cups. I jerked back, heart hammering.

“Don’t.” His voice cracked like breaking glass. “Don’t interrupt me. Please, Dr. Grant. I’ve told this story to everyone. The police thought I was insane. The reporters laughed. The priest at St. Michael’s told me I was blasphemous. The veterinarians—” He choked on something between a laugh and a sob. “The veterinarians said it was impossible.” Tears carved tracks down his weathered face.
“You’re the last person I can tell. The last one who might listen.” His eyes locked onto mine, desperate and pleading and terrified. “So I’m begging you, Dr. Grant. Don’t say a word. Don’t tell me I’m crazy. Don’t tell me what I saw wasn’t real.”
He leaned forward, and I caught the smell of unwashed clothes, of earth, of something else—something rotten and organic that made my stomach turn.
“Just listen,” he whispered. “Listen to what the sheep did.”
The fluorescent lights flickered again.


“A month ago,” Charlie began, his voice hollow, “I went to a livestock auction. Needed more sheep for the farm.” He wrapped both hands around the coffee cup like it was the only solid thing left in the world. “I had enough money to buy a few—maybe five or six at market price. But then I saw this man.” Charlie’s eyes went distant, seeing something I couldn’t. “He looked almost as miserable as I do now. Hollow. Like something had already eaten him from the inside out.”He had a small flock. Twelve sheep. And the price…” Charlie laughed, but there was no humor in it. “The price was criminal. He was practically giving them away. I should’ve known. I should’ve known something was wrong when I saw how happy he looked—no, not happy. Relieved. Like he’d just shrugged off a curse.”

His hands tightened on the cup until his knuckles went white.
“But I didn’t think. I just saw the deal. The sheep looked healthy enough. So I loaded them into my trailer and drove home, thinking I’d hit the jackpot.”
Charlie’s voice cracked. “Lauren was waiting when I pulled up. My wife—she was surprised I was back so early. ‘Goodness, Chuck,’ she said, ‘how much did all that cost?’ I told her it was a blessing. That I’d only spent half what I’d budgeted. She kissed me. Told me to keep them separate from the main flock until they all got used to each other. She didn’t want any fighting.” He stopped. Stared into his coffee like he could see her face in it.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Outside my office, I heard footsteps in the hallway—another professor arriving early. Normal sounds. Normal world. But sitting across from me was something that didn’t belong to that world anymore.
“I unloaded the sheep,” Charlie continued. “They looked fine. All except one.” His voice dropped to barely a whisper. “He was the biggest of the lot. And he was… different. The way he stood—it was like he was at attention. Alert. The others meandered like sheep do, but not him. He walked with purpose. Like he knew exactly where he was going and what he was doing. And the rest…” Charlie swallowed hard. “The rest followed him. Watched him. They didn’t act like normal sheep, but I figured it was just the stress of a new environment. New home. They’d settle in.”
He looked up at me, and I saw something break behind his eyes. “I was wrong.”

The coffee maker gurgled behind me, the sound obscenely loud in the silence.
“At first, everything seemed fine. Then a week passed, and it started.” His breathing quickened. “I woke up one night to a sound I’d never heard before. It wasn’t a normal bleat—it was… harmonizing. Like a hymn. Multiple voices finding the same note, the same rhythm.” My skin prickled.
“I thought it was coyotes at first, or maybe someone stealing from the pens. So I grabbed my shotgun and my boots and went out the back door.” Charlie’s eyes were unfocused now, lost in the memory. “My regular sheep were fine—sleeping, grazing, acting normal. But the new ones…” He stopped. His jaw worked like he was chewing on words too terrible to speak. “They were gathered in a circle. Heads bowed. Eyes closed. And that sound—it was coming from him. The leader. He was making that hymn, and the others… they were worshipping.”

The word hung in the air between us like something physical.
“I walked closer, and he stopped. Just… stopped mid-note and stared at me.” Charlie’s voice shook. “Dr. Grant, I know how this sounds. I know sheep don’t have expressions like people do. But I’m telling you—I felt what he felt. Rage. Pure, cold rage. Like I’d interrupted something sacred. Like I’d walked into a church and spit on the altar.” He wiped his face with a trembling hand.

“It scared me. Really scared me. But then my brain kicked back in and I yelled at them to scatter. They didn’t move at first. Just kept that circle, kept their heads down. Then the leader bleated—just once—and they broke apart. But he kept staring at me. That anger… it was human.” Charlie’s voice was barely audible now. “I tried to rationalize it. Maybe the previous owner had trained them somehow. Maybe it was some behavioral quirk. I didn’t know. But it was wrong. Everything about it was wrong.”

He looked up at me, and I saw the tears threatening to spill over.
“Then,” he said, his voice dropping to a growl, “that’s when the real trouble started.”
He stared down at my desk, unable to meet my eyes.
“Every few nights, I’d hear it again. That bleating song. And it wasn’t just the one sheep anymore—others were joining in. Some of my sheep, from my original flock. I’d catch them the same way every time: gathered around him, heads down, eyes closed. Sometimes they all sang together. Other nights they’d move in patterns—formations. A dance, almost. Lauren saw it too. We were both terrified, but we didn’t know what to do. Who do you call? What do you even say?”

His hands were shaking so badly now that coffee sloshed over the rim of his cup.
“After three weeks of this, I dug out the paperwork from the auction. Found the seller’s number and called it.” He laughed bitterly. “It was disconnected. Didn’t exist. So I tried looking up the man’s name, his address, anything.” Charlie looked up at me, his face a mask of despair. “Nothing. Not a damn thing. It was like he’d never existed at all. Like he’d sold me those sheep and then vanished off the face of the earth.”

The fluorescent lights flickered again.
“Or maybe,” Charlie whispered, “he was just running from the same thing I should’ve run from.” Charlie’s voice dropped to barely a whisper. “One day, I went out to the grazing fields. That’s when I saw it.” He stared at his hands like they belonged to someone else. “There was an impression in the ground. At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks—that my brain was conjuring patterns from nothing. But no.” He shook his head slowly. “It was a perfect circle. And inside… symbols. Symbols I’d never seen before. Not in any book, not in any language I knew.”

The office felt smaller suddenly. Colder. “Something had changed. The whole farm had this weight to it. Like the air itself was pressing down. Like something vast and terrible was unfolding right beneath my feet, and I was too small, too stupid to understand it.” He stopped. Drew in a shuddering breath. Tried to gather the pieces of himself that were falling apart. I realized I hadn’t touched my coffee. The cup had gone cold in my hands. Everything Charlie was saying sounded impossible—fantastical, like some fever dream or elaborate hoax. But the man across from me wasn’t lying. Whatever he’d seen, whatever he believed he’d seen, had destroyed him.

Charlie paused, his fingers tracing the rim of his coffee cup.
“I should’ve paid more attention to Lauren. Should’ve seen the signs.” His voice cracked. “But I was so focused on those damned sheep, I didn’t notice what was happening to my wife.” He drew a shuddering breath. “It started about a week after I brought them home. Lauren complained of headaches—said they came on suddenly, like something was pressing against the inside of her skull. She’d never had migraines before. I told her to see a doctor, but she kept putting it off. Said they always passed eventually.”

Charlie’s eyes went distant. “Then I started finding her at the bedroom window. Middle of the night, just… staring out at the fields. At the pens. The first time, I asked her what she was doing. She didn’t answer at first. Just kept staring. When I touched her shoulder, she turned to me with this dreamy expression and said, ‘The singing is so beautiful, Chuck.’” His hands trembled. “I hadn’t heard anything. Told her she must’ve been dreaming. She just smiled—this empty, far-away smile—and came back to bed. But it kept happening. Three, four times a week. Always at the window. Always listening to something I couldn’t hear.”
He leaned forward.

“She started humming. These strange, droning notes—nothing I recognized. She’d do it while cooking, while folding laundry. When I pointed it out, she’d look confused, like she didn’t even know she was doing it. The headaches got worse too. She’d stop mid-sentence sometimes, freeze up, stare at nothing. Then she’d blink and come back, but she’d have tears on her face. Or she’d be smiling. She could never remember what she’d seen.” Charlie’s jaw clenched. “One morning I found her outside in her nightgown, barefoot in the wet grass. She was standing at the fence, and that leader—that thing—was on the other side. Just the two of them, staring at each other. And she was humming that melody again.”
His voice dropped.

“I called out to her. She turned, and her eyes were… empty. Glassy. Like she was looking through me at something else. But then she blinked and suddenly she was confused, frightened. ‘Chuck?’ she said. ‘What am I doing out here?’ She didn’t remember walking outside. Didn’t remember any of it.” He pressed his palms against his eyes. “It went on like that for two weeks. The humming, the staring, the headaches. She’d black out sometimes—just collapse and clutch her head, saying something was trying to push its way inside her mind. Trying to show her something.” Charlie looked up at me, his face twisted with anguish
.
“Then, three days ago, she had a moment of clarity. A real moment. I came home from checking the fences and found her in the kitchen, crying. Actually sobbing. She grabbed my arms and looked at me—really looked at me—and I saw my Lauren again. The real her.” His voice broke. “‘Chuck, something’s wrong with me,’ she said. ‘I’m losing time. I’m hearing things. This morning I woke up and found this.’ She showed me her hands—there was dirt caked under her fingernails. Fresh dirt. ‘I don’t remember going outside. I don’t remember digging. But I can feel… Chuck, I can feel something calling me. And I’m scared. I’m so scared because part of me wants to answer.’”

Tears welled in Charlie’s eyes. “She was terrified. Terrified of herself. Of what she was becoming. She begged me—begged me—to get rid of those sheep. Said we had to do it immediately, that very day. But I…” He choked on the words. “I told her we’d do it tomorrow. That I needed to prepare, to figure out where to take them. I thought we had time. I thought one more night wouldn’t matter.”
He slammed his fist on the desk.

“But they knew. Those things knew she was breaking free. Knew she was fighting whatever hold they had on her. So they didn’t wait. They couldn’t risk losing her.”
Charlie’s voice became a hollow whisper. “That night—the last night—Lauren seemed better. Calmer. She made dinner, kissed me goodnight, told me she loved me. Said tomorrow everything would be okay. We went to bed early, both of us exhausted. Both of us believing we’d wake up and fix everything.”
He looked at me with eyes full of horror.

“But when I woke to that song… she was already gone. Already theirs. Whatever small part of her that had fought back that afternoon—it didn’t matter anymore. They’d taken her completely.”His voice cracked.“And I let it happen. I gave them one more night

Fresh tears welled in Charlie’s eyes. “Then came the night Lauren died.”
The words hit like a punch to the chest. “Charlie, I’m so—” His hand shot up, cutting me off. His face twisted with something beyond grief—something raw and primal. “That night, Lauren and I talked. Really talked. We’d both had enough. The farm felt wrong. Corrupted. We decided we were getting rid of those sheep—the next morning, we’d load them up, drive them out to the middle of nowhere, and let nature take its course.” His voice cracked. “I know how that sounds. I know. But Grant, you have to understand—the horror of that song. I still hear it. When I sleep. When I’m awake. It never stops. It’s maddening.” His expression shifted from grief to something far worse—the hollow-eyed stare of a man teetering on the edge of sanity.


“We went to bed early that night. Thought tomorrow everything would be fine. We’d be free. We could have our normal life back.” He laughed—a broken, ugly sound.
“But we weren’t free. We were never going to be free.” Charlie’s breathing quickened, his chest heaving. “I woke up to that song again. But this time it was louder. More aggressive. Like something vast and powerful was clawing its way into our world. And Lauren—” His voice broke. “Lauren was gone.” I gripped the armrests of my chair. “I threw on my boots, grabbed my rifle, and ran outside. Every single sheep—every single one—was arranged in a circle. No, not one circle. Three rings. Staggered. Concentric. And in the center…”

He couldn’t continue. His whole body shook. “Lauren was there. Standing with the leader. Her face—God, her face was blank. Empty. Like she wasn’t even there anymore. I screamed her name. Nothing. No response. She just stood there like a sleepwalker.” Charlie’s fists clenched. “I’d had enough. I raised my rifle and aimed at that thing—that leader, that devil that had brought this curse into my home. I pulled the trigger.” The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. “The bullet hit him. I know it hit him. I saw him flinch. But there was no blood. No cry of pain. No wound. It was like I’d thrown a pebble at him. Like he was made of something that couldn’t be hurt by anything in this world.”

Charlie looked up at me, and I saw hell reflected in his eyes. “Then Lauren laid down in the center of the circle.” His voice was barely human now—a tortured rasp. “And they started stomping on her.” I felt my stomach drop. “All of them. The leader first, then the others closed in. They trampled her with the force of draft horses. Her blood—” He choked. “Her blood sprayed up into the air. Covered them. And they kept singing. Kept dancing. Every sheep had to touch her. Had to be anointed in her blood, her guts, her—” He couldn’t finish.

“I just watched. My mind screamed at me to run, to stop them, to do something. But my body wouldn’t move. I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. It felt like hours—watching my wife trampled to death while they sang their hymn.”
Charlie’s tears fell freely now, dripping onto my desk. “When they finally stopped, they arranged themselves in a semicircle. The leader in the very center. He looked up—not at me, but at the sky—and began to sing again. The others joined. The sound… it made my head split. My vision blurred. But I saw it. God help me, I saw it.""What felt like hours of watching my wife get trampled to death, they finally stopped. They arranged themselves in a semicircle. The leader in the very center.

Charlie's eyes went hollow, staring through me at something only he could see. ""At first, I thought it was a cloud. A mass of darkness descending from above. But clouds don't *move* like that. Don't *breathe* like that. It was massive—so vast I couldn't see where it ended. Just this endless black shape covered in thousands of eyes. No, not eyes. *Apertures*. Openings. All of them fixed downward. All of them *watching*.""

His voice dropped to barely a whisper. ""And there was a sound coming from it. Not words. Not music. Something that existed before language. Before thought. A sound that made my bones vibrate, made my teeth ache, made my heart skip beats."" He gripped the edge of my desk until his knuckles went white.

""But it wasn't just a creature, Grant. It was a presence. A deity. I could feel its attention like weight, like gravity, like the hand of creation itself pressing down on me. On Lauren. On the blood-soaked earth. And in that moment—that terrible, crystallizing moment—I understood."" Tears streamed down his face.

""I understood why ancient peoples built altars. Why they dragged victims to mountaintops and temples. Why they offered up their children and their livestock and their enemies. Not out of love. Not out of devotion."" His voice cracked. ""Out of *terror*. Out of the desperate, animal hope that if they fed it enough, if they gave it what it wanted, it might pass over them. Might leave them alone for one more season. One more year."" Charlie looked at me with eyes that had seen too much.

""We call them myths—those old gods, those hungry gods. We think we've evolved past them, that we've buried them under science and reason and progress. But they never left, Grant. They've been here all along. Waiting. And the animals—the animals never forgot. They've been worshipping them since the beginning. Since before we even stood upright.""

His voice became a rasp. ""And that night, I watched my wife become their sacrament. I passed out, and when I awoke to the rising sun... All the sheep were gone. Every single one. The only thing left was…” He couldn’t say it. “Lauren’s body.” Charlie began unbuttoning his shirt with trembling fingers. He pulled the fabric aside to reveal his chest. There, burned into his skin, was a symbol. A perfect circle surrounded by intricate runes—characters that looked ancient and alien and wrong.

“I found this the next morning.” He touched the symbol on his chest, wincing as if it still burned. “It wasn’t there before. I didn’t carve it. Didn’t brand myself. I just woke up and it was in me. Part of me.” His voice grew quieter, more distant. “At first, I thought I could live with it. Thought I could bury Lauren, sell the farm, move away and forget. But the dreams started that very night.”
Charlie’s eyes glazed over, seeing something I couldn’t.

“I see him. The leader. Every time I close my eyes, he’s there. Standing in fields that stretch forever. And he’s not alone anymore, Grant. There are thousands of them now. Flocks upon flocks, all standing at attention, all watching me. All waiting.”
His hands began to tremble. “And behind them—behind all of them—I see it. That black mass. That thing they worship. But in my dreams, I can see it clearly. I can see its shape, its purpose. And it’s so much worse than what I saw that night. So much bigger.” Charlie’s breathing quickened, becoming shallow and rapid. “The symbol burns when I dream. Burns like fire, like acid. And I hear voices—not words, but meanings pushed directly into my mind. They’re teaching me things. Showing me things. The rituals. The hymns. The hunger.” He looked up at me, and I saw something had changed in his eyes. Something had broken.

“I tried to cut it out, Grant. Took a knife to my own chest. But the blade wouldn’t go deep enough. Wouldn’t cut. It’s like the symbol protects itself. Like it wants to stay in me.” His voice cracked, climbing in pitch. “I went back to the farm three days ago. I don’t know why. Something pulled me back. And I found them, Grant. I found the sheep. Not mine—new ones. Different flock, different owner. But they were already there. Already gathering in circles. Already learning the songs.” Charlie grabbed my wrist, his grip painfully tight. “It’s spreading. It doesn’t end with one flock. It moves, it infects, it teaches. And every night I dream, I see more farms. More fields. More flocks standing at attention, ready to call down their god.”

Sweat beaded on his forehead. His pupils were dilated, unfocused.
“Last night—last night I dreamed I was one of them. I was standing in the circle, head bowed, and I could feel it, Grant. I could feel the ecstasy of worship. The joy of surrender. And part of me—God forgive me, part of me wanted to stay there. Wanted to bow down and sing that hymn forever.” His voice rose, panic bleeding through. “I’m losing myself. Piece by piece, I’m becoming something else. Something that understands them. That sympathizes with them. The symbol is changing me, rewriting me from the inside out.”

Charlie stood abruptly, his chair clattering backward. He paced like a caged animal.
“I can hear it now. Even awake. That humming. It’s in my head, in my bones, in every heartbeat. It won’t stop. It won’t stop.” He clawed at his ears, his chest, leaving red marks.“I tried to pray. Went to three different churches. But every time I kneel, every time I try to say the words, I feel it watching. Laughing. My prayers turn to ash in my mouth because I know—I know—there’s something older listening. Something that doesn’t care about mercy or salvation or redemption.” His voice cracked into something between a laugh and a sob. “I’m not sleeping anymore. Can’t sleep. Because every time I close my eyes, I’m back in that field. Back in that circle. And Lauren is there, Grant. She’s there, but she’s not dead. She’s standing with them. Standing and singing. And she looks happy.”

Charlie spun to face me, tears streaming down his face.
“Is she in heaven, Grant? Or is she with them now? Is her soul trapped in that thing’s belly, singing hymns for eternity? Tell me! TELL ME!”
He slammed both fists on my desk, sending coffee cups flying.
“I can’t make it stop! The burning, the dreams, the knowing! It’s teaching me their language, their rituals, their purpose! And the worst part—the absolute worst part—is that it’s starting to make sense!” His voice rose to a desperate wail. “Grant, I understand them now! I understand why they worship! I understand what they’re building! Every flock is a congregation, every farm is a temple, and they’re all working together to bring something through! Something vast and hungry and patient!”

Charlie grabbed my shoulders, shaking me.
“It’s not just sheep, Grant! What if it’s all of them? What if every animal—every bird, every insect, every creature we’ve dismissed as mindless—what if they’re all worshipping? What if we’re surrounded by tiny churches, by millions of altars we can’t see, all calling to gods we never knew existed?”
His grip tightened painfully. And what if we’re next? What if the symbol marks me as the first? What if I’m supposed to teach others? What if that’s my purpose now—to spread this to people?”

I tried to pull away, but his strength was manic, inhuman.
“I won’t do it! I WON’T! I’d rather die than become their prophet! I’d rather—”
He stopped suddenly. His eyes went wide, pupils dilating until they were almost entirely black. “Oh God. Oh God, it’s here. It’s in the room with us.” “Charlie, there’s nothing—” 

“DON’T YOU SEE IT?!” he screamed, pointing at the empty corner of my office. “It’s right there! All those eyes! All those mouths! It’s been watching this whole time! It’s been listening!” He released me and staggered backward, clawing at the symbol on his chest. “It won’t let me go! It won’t let me die! I’m its witness! Its PROPHET! And it wants me to spread the word! It wants me to teach others to see! To hear! To WORSHIP!” Charlie collapsed to his knees, screaming—a sound of pure anguish and terror that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than his lungs. It was the sound of a soul being torn apart.

“GRANT, HELP ME! HELP ME! CUT IT OUT! CUT ME OPEN AND RIP IT OUT BEFORE IT TAKES EVERYTHING! BEFORE I BECOME—” His body convulsed. Blood began trickling from his nose. I lunged for the phone, my hands shaking so badly I could barely dial. “911, I need help! My office at the university—someone’s having a medical emergency—” The paramedics arrived within minutes, but Charlie was barely conscious by then. He thrashed weakly as they loaded him onto the stretcher, his lips moving soundlessly. 

As they wheeled him past me, I leaned in and heard him whisper:
“It’s already too late. The mark is spreading. You touched me. You listened. Now you’ll dream too.” Then his eyes rolled back and he went still.
The police took my statement. I told them about his wife’s death, his grief, his obvious mental breakdown. I didn’t mention the sheep or the rituals or the symbol. Who would believe me? That afternoon, Detective Morrison called.

“Dr. Grant? This is about Charles Saunders. I’m sorry to inform you that he passed away at County General about an hour ago.”
My blood ran cold. “What happened?” “Massive cerebral aneurysm. The doctors said it was like something burst inside his brain. Multiple vessels, all at once. They’d never seen anything like it.” A pause. “There’s something else. Something strange.”
“What?” I said in shock. “When they were preparing the body… they found burns. Fresh burns all over his torso, his arms, his legs. Symbols, Dr. Grant. Dozens of them. Like someone had branded him repeatedly. But there’s no sign of external trauma. It’s like they burned from the inside out.”

The phone nearly slipped from my hand. “The coroner wants to list it as unexplained. But between you and me?” Morrison’s voice dropped. “I’ve been a cop for twenty years. I’ve seen drug overdoses, psychotic breaks, every kind of mental breakdown. But the look on that man’s face when he died…” “What about it?” “He wasn’t afraid anymore, Dr. Grant. He looked relieved. Like dying was the only way to escape something worse

Months passed. Charlie’s story haunted me. It shouldn’t have—it was madness, trauma-induced delusion. Sheep don’t have religion. They don’t perform rituals. They don’t summon gods. But I couldn’t forget the symbol burned into his chest. The terror in his eyes. The way he’d screamed. Eventually, I moved to Texas. New job. New start. I tried to bury what Charlie had told me beneath work and routine. Then I got a call from a rancher outside Austin. Said he needed help with his flock. Behavioral issues.

“What kind of issues?” I asked. There was a long pause on the other end of the line.
“Well, hell, Doc—you’re going to think I’m crazy. But my sheep… they’re singing and dancing at night.” The phone nearly slipped from my hand.
“What did you say?” “I know how it sounds, but I swear—they gather in circles and make this sound. Like a hymn or something. And they move in patterns. Like they’re performing some kind of…” He trailed off. “Some kind of what?” My voice was barely steady. “Some kind of ceremony.”

I closed my eyes and saw Charlie’s face. Heard his screams.
“I’ll be there tomorrow,” I said. I hung up the phone and sat in the silence of my office for a long time. I’m a scientist. I’ve spent my entire career explaining animal behavior through biology, through evolution, through reason. Neurotransmitters and instinct. Stimulus and response. Everything has a rational explanation. Everything follows observable laws.

But what if we’ve been wrong? What if faith isn’t just a human invention—some evolutionary advantage that helped us cooperate, that gave us comfort in the face of death? What if animals have always known something we’ve forgotten? Something we’ve spent centuries trying to bury under logic and empiricism and the desperate belief that we’re alone in this universe?

What if there are powers in this world that demand worship? That demand sacrifice?
I opened my laptop and pulled up Charlie’s last email. Read those words again: Do you think animals believe in their own gods?My hands were shaking. Because if sheep can have gods—gods real enough to answer their prayers, gods hungry enough to manifest in our world—then what else is out there? What other creatures are kneeling before altars we can’t see? What other rituals are being performed in the dark corners of the world while we sleep in our beds, believing we’re the only ones with souls?

And the question that terrified me most, the one that kept me awake for the rest of that night: What do those gods want with us?
I packed my equipment the next morning. Loaded my truck with cameras and recording devices. Told myself I was going to document everything, to find the rational explanation, to prove that Charlie had simply witnessed some bizarre behavioral anomaly. But as I pulled onto the highway heading toward that ranch outside Austin, I felt it—that same heaviness Charlie had described. That weight pressing down. Like the air itself knew something I didn’t.

Like something vast and terrible was watching. Waiting.
And I understood, with the cold certainty of a man walking toward his own damnation, that I wasn’t going to find answers in Texas. I was going to find the same thing Charlie found. The same thing that’s been there all along, just beyond the edge of our understanding. Hungry gods. And they were waiting for someone new to witness them.

1pjrnnr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjrnnr,"The King has kicked out Prince Andrew, and this 99-year-old Indian restaurant","The Crown Estate is a strange creature. It belongs to the Monarch in right of the Crown, but behaves like an independent property outfit acting in what it calls the national interest. They own the Royal Lodge in Windsor, where Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is being asked to pack his bags next year, and they own most of Regent Street, including the building that houses Veeraswamy.

Veeraswamy opened in 1924 for the Wembley Exhibition, then moved to Regent Street two years later. It is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in Britain and holds a Michelin star. The Crown Estate now wants to redevelop the site. The restaurant sits on the first floor with its kitchens above, and its entrance is a tiny doorway with a lift. The Estate’s plans rework that entrance entirely and so are being kicked out. A judgment is pending, but anyone who has dealt with property disputes knows that appeals can drag on for years.

What I ate:

* Anglo-Indian Mulligatawny Soup £15
* Grandma's Spicy Egg Roast Masala with String Hoppers £17
* Roast Duck Vindaloo £43

Service added, and prices rounded above.

The Mulligatawny arrives, an amber broth that pulses with sweet apple and pepper, its warmth rising through a saffron haze, a punchy but comforting bowl. Then the Egg Roast Masala, the soft-boiled eggs wobbling on their tomato-rich sauce, the yolks trembling as the lattice of crisp hoppers soaks up spices and chutney. The Portuguese duck vindaloo is a brighter, jollier plate, the duck’s decadent flesh drifting through a rich, sour gravy, scattered with crisp garlicky flakes that bring it to life.

Two quick points, since people often ask. I do not usually say whether I would return to a restaurant, and I will not turn that into a habit, because it squeezes three-hour experiences into neat category, like squashing a dragonfly into a matchbox. Here, though, I have been several times, because I enjoy living food history. As for the headline, the link between the two stories is their landlord, which is factual, even if the ethics behind each situation are not comparable. It shows how the Crown Estate quietly shapes so much of public life, whatever their soft marketing language suggests. If that contrast caught your interest, I would argue that is exactly what good writing should do.

Yet all I hear from them is ”it’s not that simple”.,"I have a friend I met in high school, am 26 now. They had an obsessive crush on me, they had a habit of crushing on friends. They were my only friend and it was a toxic situation. 

Now I realise I just cannot stand it when we meet. I hate hearing about their siblings and family because I don’t have that. I hate hearing what they have done because all it does is remind me what a toxic nightmarw that friendship had been. 

It was my job to keep the friendship afloat. They were just obsessed but are the type of person who won’t come up with ideas. Just waiting to be picked.

It has been exhausting, and I keep having them in my life. I think I hope it gets better, that we’d have that friendship again but ig we won’t, it was an obsession for her. They do ask me to go for a coffee sometimes but somehow never really have time for me otherwise. Or ideas of what they’d like to do with me.

Simple meeting is hard to schedule, they don’t text back, they just wait for me to plan everything. Everytime I notice it and their poor communication is just accepted apparently, like it’s normal for me to do all the planning and they just answer ”yup”. 

They sorta say I am too quick and they are so slow, but it takes 24h to respond and I never double texted so am having trouble with this. And they can assume someone else doesn’t want to be with them if they don’t intiate and give back but with them I cannot because ”it’s not that simple”.

I stared at those words on my computer screen until they blurred. It was past midnight. The question sat there in my inbox like something alive, waiting.

I know this may sound crazy, but I’ve witnessed it firsthand. I’ve lost someone to this event—this phenomenon. Please respond. I can’t sleep. I can’t make sense of this. I need help. Please help. I’m just a sheep farmer and I need somebody to help me understand. Please reply. Please Dr. Grant, help me. 
—Charlie Saunders

My hand hovered over the keyboard. Animals with their own gods? My first instinct was to delete it—some teenager’s creative writing exercise, maybe. A prank. But then I saw the name again. Charlie Saunders. I knew Charlie. I’d been to his farm twice before, consulted on his flock’s behavior. He was the kind of man who measured his words carefully, who didn’t speak unless he had something worth saying. The kind of man who would never, never, send an email like this.
Unless something had broken him.

I wrote back immediately, told him to come to my office in the morning. He responded within the hour. Just three words: I’ll be there. I’m an ethologist. I study animal behavior—how they think, how they feel, what drives them. It’s all chemicals and instinct, evolution and adaptation. There’s no room for gods in that equation. No room for the supernatural. At least, that’s what I told myself.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that question burning behind my eyelids: Do animals believe in their own gods? By the time dawn broke, I’d convinced myself it was nothing. Stress. Grief, maybe. Charlie had probably lost a family member and wasn’t processing it well. I’d talk him through it, recommend a therapist, and that would be that. I was wrong.

Charlie was already waiting when I arrived at my office. I almost didn’t recognize him. The man I’d met before had been robust, energetic—someone who smiled easily and often. The thing slouched against my office door barely resembled him. His beard was unkempt, more white than I remembered. His eyes were sunken deep into purple-black hollows, the whites shot through with burst capillaries. He looked like he’d aged ten years in the few months since I’d seen him. Like something had reached inside him and scooped out everything vital.
“Dr. Grant,” he said. His voice was a rasp, like he’d been screaming. “Good morning.”
“Charlie.” I tried to keep my voice steady as I unlocked the door. “How long have you been waiting?” He didn’t answer. Just shuffled inside when I opened the door, moving like his bones hurt.

I flicked on the lights—the fluorescent bulbs hummed and flickered before catching—and started the coffee maker. The familiar ritual did nothing to calm the crawling sensation up my spine. Something was very, very wrong. “The university looks good,” Charlie mumbled, staring at nothing. I poured him coffee with shaking hands. “Black, right?” A nod. Barely. I sat across from him and forced myself to look—really look—at what he’d become. His hands trembled around the cup. There were dirt stains under his fingernails. And his eyes… God, his eyes were the worst part. They had the hollow, haunted quality of someone who’d seen something they could never unsee.
“Charlie, what happened—” His fist slammed into my desk so hard the coffee jumped in our cups. I jerked back, heart hammering.

“Don’t.” His voice cracked like breaking glass. “Don’t interrupt me. Please, Dr. Grant. I’ve told this story to everyone. The police thought I was insane. The reporters laughed. The priest at St. Michael’s told me I was blasphemous. The veterinarians—” He choked on something between a laugh and a sob. “The veterinarians said it was impossible.” Tears carved tracks down his weathered face.
“You’re the last person I can tell. The last one who might listen.” His eyes locked onto mine, desperate and pleading and terrified. “So I’m begging you, Dr. Grant. Don’t say a word. Don’t tell me I’m crazy. Don’t tell me what I saw wasn’t real.”
He leaned forward, and I caught the smell of unwashed clothes, of earth, of something else—something rotten and organic that made my stomach turn.
“Just listen,” he whispered. “Listen to what the sheep did.”
The fluorescent lights flickered again.


“A month ago,” Charlie began, his voice hollow, “I went to a livestock auction. Needed more sheep for the farm.” He wrapped both hands around the coffee cup like it was the only solid thing left in the world. “I had enough money to buy a few—maybe five or six at market price. But then I saw this man.” Charlie’s eyes went distant, seeing something I couldn’t. “He looked almost as miserable as I do now. Hollow. Like something had already eaten him from the inside out.”He had a small flock. Twelve sheep. And the price…” Charlie laughed, but there was no humor in it. “The price was criminal. He was practically giving them away. I should’ve known. I should’ve known something was wrong when I saw how happy he looked—no, not happy. Relieved. Like he’d just shrugged off a curse.”

His hands tightened on the cup until his knuckles went white.
“But I didn’t think. I just saw the deal. The sheep looked healthy enough. So I loaded them into my trailer and drove home, thinking I’d hit the jackpot.”
Charlie’s voice cracked. “Lauren was waiting when I pulled up. My wife—she was surprised I was back so early. ‘Goodness, Chuck,’ she said, ‘how much did all that cost?’ I told her it was a blessing. That I’d only spent half what I’d budgeted. She kissed me. Told me to keep them separate from the main flock until they all got used to each other. She didn’t want any fighting.” He stopped. Stared into his coffee like he could see her face in it.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Outside my office, I heard footsteps in the hallway—another professor arriving early. Normal sounds. Normal world. But sitting across from me was something that didn’t belong to that world anymore.
“I unloaded the sheep,” Charlie continued. “They looked fine. All except one.” His voice dropped to barely a whisper. “He was the biggest of the lot. And he was… different. The way he stood—it was like he was at attention. Alert. The others meandered like sheep do, but not him. He walked with purpose. Like he knew exactly where he was going and what he was doing. And the rest…” Charlie swallowed hard. “The rest followed him. Watched him. They didn’t act like normal sheep, but I figured it was just the stress of a new environment. New home. They’d settle in.”
He looked up at me, and I saw something break behind his eyes. “I was wrong.”

The coffee maker gurgled behind me, the sound obscenely loud in the silence.
“At first, everything seemed fine. Then a week passed, and it started.” His breathing quickened. “I woke up one night to a sound I’d never heard before. It wasn’t a normal bleat—it was… harmonizing. Like a hymn. Multiple voices finding the same note, the same rhythm.” My skin prickled.
“I thought it was coyotes at first, or maybe someone stealing from the pens. So I grabbed my shotgun and my boots and went out the back door.” Charlie’s eyes were unfocused now, lost in the memory. “My regular sheep were fine—sleeping, grazing, acting normal. But the new ones…” He stopped. His jaw worked like he was chewing on words too terrible to speak. “They were gathered in a circle. Heads bowed. Eyes closed. And that sound—it was coming from him. The leader. He was making that hymn, and the others… they were worshipping.”

The word hung in the air between us like something physical.
“I walked closer, and he stopped. Just… stopped mid-note and stared at me.” Charlie’s voice shook. “Dr. Grant, I know how this sounds. I know sheep don’t have expressions like people do. But I’m telling you—I felt what he felt. Rage. Pure, cold rage. Like I’d interrupted something sacred. Like I’d walked into a church and spit on the altar.” He wiped his face with a trembling hand.

“It scared me. Really scared me. But then my brain kicked back in and I yelled at them to scatter. They didn’t move at first. Just kept that circle, kept their heads down. Then the leader bleated—just once—and they broke apart. But he kept staring at me. That anger… it was human.” Charlie’s voice was barely audible now. “I tried to rationalize it. Maybe the previous owner had trained them somehow. Maybe it was some behavioral quirk. I didn’t know. But it was wrong. Everything about it was wrong.”

He looked up at me, and I saw the tears threatening to spill over.
“Then,” he said, his voice dropping to a growl, “that’s when the real trouble started.”
He stared down at my desk, unable to meet my eyes.
“Every few nights, I’d hear it again. That bleating song. And it wasn’t just the one sheep anymore—others were joining in. Some of my sheep, from my original flock. I’d catch them the same way every time: gathered around him, heads down, eyes closed. Sometimes they all sang together. Other nights they’d move in patterns—formations. A dance, almost. Lauren saw it too. We were both terrified, but we didn’t know what to do. Who do you call? What do you even say?”

His hands were shaking so badly now that coffee sloshed over the rim of his cup.
“After three weeks of this, I dug out the paperwork from the auction. Found the seller’s number and called it.” He laughed bitterly. “It was disconnected. Didn’t exist. So I tried looking up the man’s name, his address, anything.” Charlie looked up at me, his face a mask of despair. “Nothing. Not a damn thing. It was like he’d never existed at all. Like he’d sold me those sheep and then vanished off the face of the earth.”

The fluorescent lights flickered again.
“Or maybe,” Charlie whispered, “he was just running from the same thing I should’ve run from.” Charlie’s voice dropped to barely a whisper. “One day, I went out to the grazing fields. That’s when I saw it.” He stared at his hands like they belonged to someone else. “There was an impression in the ground. At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks—that my brain was conjuring patterns from nothing. But no.” He shook his head slowly. “It was a perfect circle. And inside… symbols. Symbols I’d never seen before. Not in any book, not in any language I knew.”

The office felt smaller suddenly. Colder. “Something had changed. The whole farm had this weight to it. Like the air itself was pressing down. Like something vast and terrible was unfolding right beneath my feet, and I was too small, too stupid to understand it.” He stopped. Drew in a shuddering breath. Tried to gather the pieces of himself that were falling apart. I realized I hadn’t touched my coffee. The cup had gone cold in my hands. Everything Charlie was saying sounded impossible—fantastical, like some fever dream or elaborate hoax. But the man across from me wasn’t lying. Whatever he’d seen, whatever he believed he’d seen, had destroyed him.

Charlie paused, his fingers tracing the rim of his coffee cup.
“I should’ve paid more attention to Lauren. Should’ve seen the signs.” His voice cracked. “But I was so focused on those damned sheep, I didn’t notice what was happening to my wife.” He drew a shuddering breath. “It started about a week after I brought them home. Lauren complained of headaches—said they came on suddenly, like something was pressing against the inside of her skull. She’d never had migraines before. I told her to see a doctor, but she kept putting it off. Said they always passed eventually.”

Charlie’s eyes went distant. “Then I started finding her at the bedroom window. Middle of the night, just… staring out at the fields. At the pens. The first time, I asked her what she was doing. She didn’t answer at first. Just kept staring. When I touched her shoulder, she turned to me with this dreamy expression and said, ‘The singing is so beautiful, Chuck.’” His hands trembled. “I hadn’t heard anything. Told her she must’ve been dreaming. She just smiled—this empty, far-away smile—and came back to bed. But it kept happening. Three, four times a week. Always at the window. Always listening to something I couldn’t hear.”
He leaned forward.

“She started humming. These strange, droning notes—nothing I recognized. She’d do it while cooking, while folding laundry. When I pointed it out, she’d look confused, like she didn’t even know she was doing it. The headaches got worse too. She’d stop mid-sentence sometimes, freeze up, stare at nothing. Then she’d blink and come back, but she’d have tears on her face. Or she’d be smiling. She could never remember what she’d seen.” Charlie’s jaw clenched. “One morning I found her outside in her nightgown, barefoot in the wet grass. She was standing at the fence, and that leader—that thing—was on the other side. Just the two of them, staring at each other. And she was humming that melody again.”
His voice dropped.

“I called out to her. She turned, and her eyes were… empty. Glassy. Like she was looking through me at something else. But then she blinked and suddenly she was confused, frightened. ‘Chuck?’ she said. ‘What am I doing out here?’ She didn’t remember walking outside. Didn’t remember any of it.” He pressed his palms against his eyes. “It went on like that for two weeks. The humming, the staring, the headaches. She’d black out sometimes—just collapse and clutch her head, saying something was trying to push its way inside her mind. Trying to show her something.” Charlie looked up at me, his face twisted with anguish
.
“Then, three days ago, she had a moment of clarity. A real moment. I came home from checking the fences and found her in the kitchen, crying. Actually sobbing. She grabbed my arms and looked at me—really looked at me—and I saw my Lauren again. The real her.” His voice broke. “‘Chuck, something’s wrong with me,’ she said. ‘I’m losing time. I’m hearing things. This morning I woke up and found this.’ She showed me her hands—there was dirt caked under her fingernails. Fresh dirt. ‘I don’t remember going outside. I don’t remember digging. But I can feel… Chuck, I can feel something calling me. And I’m scared. I’m so scared because part of me wants to answer.’”

Tears welled in Charlie’s eyes. “She was terrified. Terrified of herself. Of what she was becoming. She begged me—begged me—to get rid of those sheep. Said we had to do it immediately, that very day. But I…” He choked on the words. “I told her we’d do it tomorrow. That I needed to prepare, to figure out where to take them. I thought we had time. I thought one more night wouldn’t matter.”
He slammed his fist on the desk.

“But they knew. Those things knew she was breaking free. Knew she was fighting whatever hold they had on her. So they didn’t wait. They couldn’t risk losing her.”
Charlie’s voice became a hollow whisper. “That night—the last night—Lauren seemed better. Calmer. She made dinner, kissed me goodnight, told me she loved me. Said tomorrow everything would be okay. We went to bed early, both of us exhausted. Both of us believing we’d wake up and fix everything.”
He looked at me with eyes full of horror.

“But when I woke to that song… she was already gone. Already theirs. Whatever small part of her that had fought back that afternoon—it didn’t matter anymore. They’d taken her completely.”His voice cracked.“And I let it happen. I gave them one more night

Fresh tears welled in Charlie’s eyes. “Then came the night Lauren died.”
The words hit like a punch to the chest. “Charlie, I’m so—” His hand shot up, cutting me off. His face twisted with something beyond grief—something raw and primal. “That night, Lauren and I talked. Really talked. We’d both had enough. The farm felt wrong. Corrupted. We decided we were getting rid of those sheep—the next morning, we’d load them up, drive them out to the middle of nowhere, and let nature take its course.” His voice cracked. “I know how that sounds. I know. But Grant, you have to understand—the horror of that song. I still hear it. When I sleep. When I’m awake. It never stops. It’s maddening.” His expression shifted from grief to something far worse—the hollow-eyed stare of a man teetering on the edge of sanity.


“We went to bed early that night. Thought tomorrow everything would be fine. We’d be free. We could have our normal life back.” He laughed—a broken, ugly sound.
“But we weren’t free. We were never going to be free.” Charlie’s breathing quickened, his chest heaving. “I woke up to that song again. But this time it was louder. More aggressive. Like something vast and powerful was clawing its way into our world. And Lauren—” His voice broke. “Lauren was gone.” I gripped the armrests of my chair. “I threw on my boots, grabbed my rifle, and ran outside. Every single sheep—every single one—was arranged in a circle. No, not one circle. Three rings. Staggered. Concentric. And in the center…”

He couldn’t continue. His whole body shook. “Lauren was there. Standing with the leader. Her face—God, her face was blank. Empty. Like she wasn’t even there anymore. I screamed her name. Nothing. No response. She just stood there like a sleepwalker.” Charlie’s fists clenched. “I’d had enough. I raised my rifle and aimed at that thing—that leader, that devil that had brought this curse into my home. I pulled the trigger.” The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. “The bullet hit him. I know it hit him. I saw him flinch. But there was no blood. No cry of pain. No wound. It was like I’d thrown a pebble at him. Like he was made of something that couldn’t be hurt by anything in this world.”

Charlie looked up at me, and I saw hell reflected in his eyes. “Then Lauren laid down in the center of the circle.” His voice was barely human now—a tortured rasp. “And they started stomping on her.” I felt my stomach drop. “All of them. The leader first, then the others closed in. They trampled her with the force of draft horses. Her blood—” He choked. “Her blood sprayed up into the air. Covered them. And they kept singing. Kept dancing. Every sheep had to touch her. Had to be anointed in her blood, her guts, her—” He couldn’t finish.

“I just watched. My mind screamed at me to run, to stop them, to do something. But my body wouldn’t move. I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. It felt like hours—watching my wife trampled to death while they sang their hymn.”
Charlie’s tears fell freely now, dripping onto my desk. “When they finally stopped, they arranged themselves in a semicircle. The leader in the very center. He looked up—not at me, but at the sky—and began to sing again. The others joined. The sound… it made my head split. My vision blurred. But I saw it. God help me, I saw it.""What felt like hours of watching my wife get trampled to death, they finally stopped. They arranged themselves in a semicircle. The leader in the very center. He looked up—not at me, but at the *sky*—and began to sing again. The others joined. The sound... it made my head split. My vision blurred. But I saw it. God help me, I saw it."" ""Saw what?"" I whispered.

Charlie's eyes went hollow, staring through me at something only he could see. ""At first, I thought it was a cloud. A mass of darkness descending from above. But clouds don't *move* like that. Don't *breathe* like that. It was massive—so vast I couldn't see where it ended. Just this endless black shape covered in thousands of eyes. No, not eyes. *Apertures*. Openings. All of them fixed downward. All of them *watching*.""

His voice dropped to barely a whisper. ""And there was a sound coming from it. Not words. Not music. Something that existed before language. Before thought. A sound that made my bones vibrate, made my teeth ache, made my heart skip beats."" He gripped the edge of my desk until his knuckles went white.

""But it wasn't just a creature, Grant. It was a presence. A deity. I could feel its attention like weight, like gravity, like the hand of creation itself pressing down on me. On Lauren. On the blood-soaked earth. And in that moment—that terrible, crystallizing moment—I understood."" Tears streamed down his face.

""I understood why ancient peoples built altars. Why they dragged victims to mountaintops and temples. Why they offered up their children and their livestock and their enemies. Not out of love. Not out of devotion."" His voice cracked. ""Out of *terror*. Out of the desperate, animal hope that if they fed it enough, if they gave it what it wanted, it might pass over them. Might leave them alone for one more season. One more year."" Charlie looked at me with eyes that had seen too much.

""We call them myths—those old gods, those hungry gods. We think we've evolved past them, that we've buried them under science and reason and progress. But they never left, Grant. They've been here all along. Waiting. And the animals—the animals never forgot. They've been worshipping them since the beginning. Since before we even stood upright.""

His voice became a rasp. ""And that night, I watched my wife become their sacrament. I passed out, and when I awoke to the rising sun... All the sheep were gone. Every single one. The only thing left was…” He couldn’t say it. “Lauren’s body.” Charlie began unbuttoning his shirt with trembling fingers. He pulled the fabric aside to reveal his chest. There, burned into his skin, was a symbol. A perfect circle surrounded by intricate runes—characters that looked ancient and alien and wrong.

“I found this the next morning.” He touched the symbol on his chest, wincing as if it still burned. “It wasn’t there before. I didn’t carve it. Didn’t brand myself. I just woke up and it was in me. Part of me.” His voice grew quieter, more distant. “At first, I thought I could live with it. Thought I could bury Lauren, sell the farm, move away and forget. But the dreams started that very night.”
Charlie’s eyes glazed over, seeing something I couldn’t.

“I see him. The leader. Every time I close my eyes, he’s there. Standing in fields that stretch forever. And he’s not alone anymore, Grant. There are thousands of them now. Flocks upon flocks, all standing at attention, all watching me. All waiting.”
His hands began to tremble. “And behind them—behind all of them—I see it. That black mass. That thing they worship. But in my dreams, I can see it clearly. I can see its shape, its purpose. And it’s so much worse than what I saw that night. So much bigger.” Charlie’s breathing quickened, becoming shallow and rapid. “The symbol burns when I dream. Burns like fire, like acid. And I hear voices—not words, but meanings pushed directly into my mind. They’re teaching me things. Showing me things. The rituals. The hymns. The hunger.” He looked up at me, and I saw something had changed in his eyes. Something had broken.

“I tried to cut it out, Grant. Took a knife to my own chest. But the blade wouldn’t go deep enough. Wouldn’t cut. It’s like the symbol protects itself. Like it wants to stay in me.” His voice cracked, climbing in pitch. “I went back to the farm three days ago. I don’t know why. Something pulled me back. And I found them, Grant. I found the sheep. Not mine—new ones. Different flock, different owner. But they were already there. Already gathering in circles. Already learning the songs.” Charlie grabbed my wrist, his grip painfully tight. “It’s spreading. It doesn’t end with one flock. It moves, it infects, it teaches. And every night I dream, I see more farms. More fields. More flocks standing at attention, ready to call down their god.”

Sweat beaded on his forehead. His pupils were dilated, unfocused.
“Last night—last night I dreamed I was one of them. I was standing in the circle, head bowed, and I could feel it, Grant. I could feel the ecstasy of worship. The joy of surrender. And part of me—God forgive me, part of me wanted to stay there. Wanted to bow down and sing that hymn forever.” His voice rose, panic bleeding through. “I’m losing myself. Piece by piece, I’m becoming something else. Something that understands them. That sympathizes with them. The symbol is changing me, rewriting me from the inside out.”

Charlie stood abruptly, his chair clattering backward. He paced like a caged animal.
“I can hear it now. Even awake. That humming. It’s in my head, in my bones, in every heartbeat. It won’t stop. It won’t stop.” He clawed at his ears, his chest, leaving red marks.“I tried to pray. Went to three different churches. But every time I kneel, every time I try to say the words, I feel it watching. Laughing. My prayers turn to ash in my mouth because I know—I know—there’s something older listening. Something that doesn’t care about mercy or salvation or redemption.” His voice cracked into something between a laugh and a sob. “I’m not sleeping anymore. Can’t sleep. Because every time I close my eyes, I’m back in that field. Back in that circle. And Lauren is there, Grant. She’s there, but she’s not dead. She’s standing with them. Standing and singing. And she looks happy.”

Charlie spun to face me, tears streaming down his face.
“Is she in heaven, Grant? Or is she with them now? Is her soul trapped in that thing’s belly, singing hymns for eternity? Tell me! TELL ME!”
He slammed both fists on my desk, sending coffee cups flying.
“I can’t make it stop! The burning, the dreams, the knowing! It’s teaching me their language, their rituals, their purpose! And the worst part—the absolute worst part—is that it’s starting to make sense!” His voice rose to a desperate wail. “Grant, I understand them now! I understand why they worship! I understand what they’re building! Every flock is a congregation, every farm is a temple, and they’re all working together to bring something through! Something vast and hungry and patient!”

Charlie grabbed my shoulders, shaking me.
“It’s not just sheep, Grant! What if it’s all of them? What if every animal—every bird, every insect, every creature we’ve dismissed as mindless—what if they’re all worshipping? What if we’re surrounded by tiny churches, by millions of altars we can’t see, all calling to gods we never knew existed?”
His grip tightened painfully. And what if we’re next? What if the symbol marks me as the first? What if I’m supposed to teach others? What if that’s my purpose now—to spread this to people?”

I tried to pull away, but his strength was manic, inhuman.
“I won’t do it! I WON’T! I’d rather die than become their prophet! I’d rather—”
He stopped suddenly. His eyes went wide, pupils dilating until they were almost entirely black. “Oh God. Oh God, it’s here. It’s in the room with us.” “Charlie, there’s nothing—” 

“DON’T YOU SEE IT?!” he screamed, pointing at the empty corner of my office. “It’s right there! All those eyes! All those mouths! It’s been watching this whole time! It’s been listening!” He released me and staggered backward, clawing at the symbol on his chest. “It won’t let me go! It won’t let me die! I’m its witness! Its PROPHET! And it wants me to spread the word! It wants me to teach others to see! To hear! To WORSHIP!” Charlie collapsed to his knees, screaming—a sound of pure anguish and terror that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than his lungs. It was the sound of a soul being torn apart.

“GRANT, HELP ME! HELP ME! CUT IT OUT! CUT ME OPEN AND RIP IT OUT BEFORE IT TAKES EVERYTHING! BEFORE I BECOME—” His body convulsed. Blood began trickling from his nose. I lunged for the phone, my hands shaking so badly I could barely dial. “911, I need help! My office at the university—someone’s having a medical emergency—” The paramedics arrived within minutes, but Charlie was barely conscious by then. He thrashed weakly as they loaded him onto the stretcher, his lips moving soundlessly. 

As they wheeled him past me, I leaned in and heard him whisper:
“It’s already too late. The mark is spreading. You touched me. You listened. Now you’ll dream too.” Then his eyes rolled back and he went still.
The police took my statement. I told them about his wife’s death, his grief, his obvious mental breakdown. I didn’t mention the sheep or the rituals or the symbol. Who would believe me? That afternoon, Detective Morrison called.

“Dr. Grant? This is about Charles Saunders. I’m sorry to inform you that he passed away at County General about an hour ago.”
My blood ran cold. “What happened?” “Massive cerebral aneurysm. The doctors said it was like something burst inside his brain. Multiple vessels, all at once. They’d never seen anything like it.” A pause. “There’s something else. Something strange.”
“What?” I said in shock. “When they were preparing the body… they found burns. Fresh burns all over his torso, his arms, his legs. Symbols, Dr. Grant. Dozens of them. Like someone had branded him repeatedly. But there’s no sign of external trauma. It’s like they burned from the inside out.”

The phone nearly slipped from my hand. “The coroner wants to list it as unexplained. But between you and me?” Morrison’s voice dropped. “I’ve been a cop for twenty years. I’ve seen drug overdoses, psychotic breaks, every kind of mental breakdown. But the look on that man’s face when he died…” “What about it?” “He wasn’t afraid anymore, Dr. Grant. He looked relieved. Like dying was the only way to escape something worse

Months passed. Charlie’s story haunted me. It shouldn’t have—it was madness, trauma-induced delusion. Sheep don’t have religion. They don’t perform rituals. They don’t summon gods. But I couldn’t forget the symbol burned into his chest. The terror in his eyes. The way he’d screamed. Eventually, I moved to Texas. New job. New start. I tried to bury what Charlie had told me beneath work and routine. Then I got a call from a rancher outside Austin. Said he needed help with his flock. Behavioral issues.

“What kind of issues?” I asked. There was a long pause on the other end of the line.
“Well, hell, Doc—you’re going to think I’m crazy. But my sheep… they’re singing and dancing at night.” The phone nearly slipped from my hand.
“What did you say?” “I know how it sounds, but I swear—they gather in circles and make this sound. Like a hymn or something. And they move in patterns. Like they’re performing some kind of…” He trailed off. “Some kind of what?” My voice was barely steady. “Some kind of ceremony.”

I closed my eyes and saw Charlie’s face. Heard his screams.
“I’ll be there tomorrow,” I said. I hung up the phone and sat in the silence of my office for a long time. I’m a scientist. I’ve spent my entire career explaining animal behavior through biology, through evolution, through reason. Neurotransmitters and instinct. Stimulus and response. Everything has a rational explanation. Everything follows observable laws.

But what if we’ve been wrong? What if faith isn’t just a human invention—some evolutionary advantage that helped us cooperate, that gave us comfort in the face of death? What if animals have always known something we’ve forgotten? Something we’ve spent centuries trying to bury under logic and empiricism and the desperate belief that we’re alone in this universe?

What if there are powers in this world that demand worship? That demand sacrifice?
I opened my laptop and pulled up Charlie’s last email. Read those words again: Do you think animals believe in their own gods?My hands were shaking. Because if sheep can have gods—gods real enough to answer their prayers, gods hungry enough to manifest in our world—then what else is out there? What other creatures are kneeling before altars we can’t see? What other rituals are being performed in the dark corners of the world while we sleep in our beds, believing we’re the only ones with souls?

And the question that terrified me most, the one that kept me awake for the rest of that night: What do those gods want with us?
I packed my equipment the next morning. Loaded my truck with cameras and recording devices. Told myself I was going to document everything, to find the rational explanation, to prove that Charlie had simply witnessed some bizarre behavioral anomaly. But as I pulled onto the highway heading toward that ranch outside Austin, I felt it—that same heaviness Charlie had described. That weight pressing down. Like the air itself knew something I didn’t.

Like something vast and terrible was watching. Waiting. And I understood, with the cold certainty of a man walking toward his own damnation, that I wasn’t going to find answers in Texas. I was going to find the same thing Charlie found. The same thing that’s been there all along, just beyond the edge of our understanding. Hungry gods. And they were waiting for someone new to witness them.

I’m 30m and working from home today, so I figured it might be a good time to meet some new people (also kill boredom and make the time pass). I’m into sports, tattoos, music, interior design and just keeping things positive and relaxed.

I’ve lived in Berlin, Istanbul and Copenhagen, and I studied in Spain as well. In total I’ve lived in over five countries and speak four languages. I’m left wing, open minded and pretty easy to talk to. I’ve also been in a poly and open relationship before, so I’m understanding of different lifestyles and perspectives.

I collect vinyls and play guitar, harmonica and a bit of synthesizer. I love 35mm film photography. I’m more of a tea person than a coffee person. I’m 180 cm and thinking about switching from lifting to calisthenics. I’m a big dog person and love animals in general.

I also have a couple of slightly annoying opinions: I honestly think non-alcoholic cocktails are a scam, and I still don’t understand how indoor plants manage to die when we’re literally living through global warming and all they need is a bit of water now and then.

I am working from home today and I have finished my tasks earlier than I expected. That's why I am up for a chat. If needed, can also jump to Discord, Telegram etc. 

Probably noone would read it but anyways, come say hi with a song rec!

This chart reflects prices at a 0% markup, with no skills for profit increase or yield increase to ensure a fair and equal baseline for all items. In game profit will almost always be **higher** for all items because of this. 

Prices do not reflect fertilizer and water needs as depending on your gameplay the cost could vary wildly or even be non-existent. Growth time is calculated based on optimal season time. I did not want to try to average the time as this will be highly dependent on how long you continue to grow a product, if you pay attention to seasonal growth, and at what calendar day you planted on (ex: you planted mushrooms on day 28 of summer vs day 26). Jute Cantaloupe and Mushrooms have the highest difference in actual year round growth time vs peak growth time.

Hi chat. I’m new here. I don’t want to involve people in my life with what is happening right now.

Me and my fiance have been together for 2.5 years. Got engaged after 11 months, but we had known each other very closely since 2008

He’s by far the kindest person i know, but job stability has been extremely rocky (he’s on job  6 in the span of us being together). I moved him to Chicago like 6 months ago because i work out of here and i couldn’t do the commute anymore between Missouri and Chicago (I’ve had the same job for 8 years). I have been begging since we started dating for a job with health insurance, he says that the jobs never offer. He’s never had it.

Since we moved, he has become an insane version of the party animal I’ve met. Don’t get me wrong, we both love a cocktail but he started doing hugs(snowflakes I’m not sure what’s allowed as IM not on here much) on top of that. I kept trying to subtly call it, mainly bc I’ve been painted a villain in the past for saying that he’s a binge drinker and trying to get him to leave places when he’s too sloppy

It came to a head about 1.5 months ago. The dog i had that now lives with my parents (i travel for work and my mom became obsessed with him so he stayed there) has been diagnosed with sun downers and the diagnosis rattled me hard. I cried myself to sleep that night. When he came home from work, he expressed he wanted to go out with coworkers. I told him i could really use him home and fell asleep with him holding me. I woke up, he was gone. It wasn’t until I was about halfway done getting ready for work (4:30AM) he stumbled in and passed out immediately on the couch without hardly acknowledging me. I left for work, but I was so mad I left my ring sitting on the coffee table in front of him.

He got sober for a bit, and is now drinking again. The past couple of times he’s relapsed he’s told me I’m unsupportive and that i don’t know how to talk to an addict. Unfortunately, I’m very confrontational and I know I have poor delivery, especially when things scare me. But tonight he expressed I was in the wrong and that “I didn’t need him there while I was alseep”. I’m sure he’s right and I am dramatic as i acknowledge that I can often be loud and wrong. I’m just not sure where to go from here. We had a huge fight. He told me I forced him to move here, which I did. I’m comfortable here and it’s easier for me for work, but I feel so guilty for doing so.

I don’t really know what I’m asking for at this point. I’m just really alone in this and need advice on either if this is what life is going to look like or if i need to do more work on myself. I have severe anxiety and got new meds, therapists and tons of other stuff to make myself a Better partner. I’m open to anything.",2,1765438079.0,relationships,9,0.75,False

1pjrgvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1pjrgvc/my_dad_is_a_terrible_person/,My Dad is a terrible person,"Ever since not being able to work due to medical reasons, my dad turned to Tiktok and it literally scrolling all day everyday. He doesn't help around the household and unless someone else is doing it it doesn't get done. I am talking about him making coffee and the leaving the milk OPEN and outside the fridge. He HAS to get drunk at least once a week and is perfectly able to drive himself to a grocery store to get his booze or drive to meet up with friends to drink beer, yet can't be bothered to do the grocery shopping or literally anything.
His ONLY task is to cook twice a day and when something is out, he simply doesn't cook, you have to brainstorm ideas for him of what to cook instead or eat instant ramen or make something for yourself. Oftentimes nothing gets cooked because my mom said ""Hey maybe you can make *insert dish* instead."" And that brings my dad into a total meltdown and he starts to either scream or use the fakt that my mom suggested something else as an argument for why nothing got cooked.
Plus his political stance, that he always talks about is quite frankly terrifying.
He literally has N@zi ideology and thinks H!7L3r is good.
He supports war in Ukraine and is racist, homophobic and brainwashed by Russian propaganda.
Probably because his Tiktok feed only consists of N@zi stuff and Russian propaganda.
Sometimes my mom and I just talk about things that have absolutely nothing to do with politics and he will chime in with whatever Tiktok told him was true or his ideology.
He LOVES spending fake news and he doesn't even try to Fakt check and instead tells everyone he knows. Plus he sometimes just lies to get a reaction.
Imagine, you asked him to look at the weather because of your trip and he will tell you that it will be really stormy. You yourself have to look it up to see how bad it is and it turns out that that was a straight up lie. He will then laugh at you. Now imagine this everyday for literally everything.
I kind of believe that he always was a bad person, even before his Operation.
He proudly told me that he used to sneak zaza into people's drinks or offer them candy with zaza. When I reacted with shock he was genuinely confused.
He tells stories about his youth and it's full of red flags.
Plus my family got a dog (bad idea), my dad always hits her and screams her, simply for begging him to go outside and then when the dog does it's business on the floor, my dad will scream at the dog and my mom will have to scold the dog and clean everything up.
I dislike dogs and always have, but even I show her more affection than my dad.
He seemingly hates my mom and sees my sister and I as an inconvenience that he sometimes has to drive when the situation is dire.
Since I am 19 and I'm college and still living with my parents, I plan on finishing studying, then getting a job and living for a little with my parents to gain enough money to move out.
I can't afford to do it sooner, because engineering is a really hard and time consuming thing to study.
After moving out I will reduce the time I spend with my dad as much as I can.
Plus my mom works from home wich kinda makes my dad doing nothing all day kinda worse.

1pjrdpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pjrdpa/another_day/,Another Day,"I actually woke up in the bed this morning. The alarm on my phone was going off. I changed the clothes I had slept in and made my way downstairs.

I made my usual coffee and have a seat. It isn't long before I'm thinking again, about the usual things. I take a little extra time with my coffee today. A little longer time alone in the morning was always good.

I always like that.

I finished my coffee and put my cup in the sink . Rubbing my face to wake up a little bit more, I realize I'm a couple days overdue to shave. I touch my hair and it is growing in a little thick too. I set a time on my phone for 1 o'clock reminder to get a haircut the next day.

I eventually make my way outside for my daily walk, going the usual route. I was only out for a few minutes before I was stopped by Mrs Stinson while she was walking her dog. She told me her daughter was coming to visit her soon and that her daughter had asked about me on her previous visit. I've never met her daughter but I guess Mrs Stinson has likely mentioned me at some point in some conversation. Mrs Stinson said that I should stop by when she visits, and introduce myself. I just tell her to let me know when she's here and I'll do just that.

With a short goodbye I continued my walk. I do a lot of thinking when I'm walking. A lot of thinking. In general it's a good neighborhood, it's always quiet.

I always liked that.

I picked up the clothes at the dry cleaner while I was out. I'm not in there very often, but the shop guy wanted some small talk anyway. I just kind of nodded through most of it, a few verbal yeses and noes in there. I paid for the service and I left.

I make a mental note to myself that I should really get to know the guy's name. I've been coming here, albeit infrequently, couple years now and I never learned his name. Seems awfully rude of me .

I never liked that.

I got home I put my clothes away. I grabbed my car keys and headed to the grocery store. I did my usual browsing of mostly looking and putting a couple items in the basket. Half the time I'm not even paying attention to what I'm looking at. I'm actually still doing what I always do, think.

I like this time alone. 

I know I was there for quite awhile when my phone started to go off. A reminder for me that I needed to call my mother and check in.

I put everything that was in the basket back on the shelves and put the basket away before heading home. I don't know why I do this, I rarely buy anything.

I never liked that.

I called my mother and I listened to her tell me what she was planning for the week. I let her go on about a couple of her friends, and how they might get together the following weekend.

She asked me what I was doing and I just replied, the usual. She asked me how I was and I told her, I was good. She did ask me if I was eating and, of course, I told her I was.

She started on about how Susie was doing and that she was hoping that the man she was dating was going to pop the question soon. I told her that it was nice and I hope he did pop ot soon. My little sis needs happiness, too. We said our goodbyes and our I love yous and I ended the call.

I actually don't know if I like that.

I made another cup of coffee and just sat and thought for a while. I don't know how long I sat there but I ended up pouring most of it down the sink.

I went into the den and had a seat. I just needed some more time to think and I needed to do it somewhere other than the kitchen. I kind of have wished that I fell asleep while I was sitting in the den, but alas, sleep never came. 

I never liked that.

Before I knew it my phone had gone off again telling me that it was dinner time. I didn't want to do what I did last night so I went to the pantry, where I found a can of raviolis, placed it into a bowl and I warmed it up in the microwave.

I told myself that at least I didn't do what I did last time and just eat it out of the can. I also told myself that at least I'm actually eating tonight, versus being told to by my phone alarm and still not doing it.

I didn't like doing that.

I rinsed my dishes and I put them in the dishwasher and made my way out to the outside porch and just sat down. Feeling a bit chilly I went back in and put a coat on when my phone went off again. It's the secondary reminder telling me that I should take all of my vitamins and medicine. I honestly do not remember the first alarm going off this morning, which is usually during my first cup of coffee.

I didn't like that. 

Making for the counter I grab my pills, including the sleeping pill I'm going to need, so I can scratch that alarm. I walk to the sink where I just run some water over my cupped hand, bringing it to my mouth real quick, and swallowing them all in one gulp.

I return to the back porch, and have a seat. Tonight is colder than the previous nights. I briefly think about going back inside and getting a thicker coat. Instead I just sit there and look around.

Despite having neighbors with lights in the back, the backyard is almost completely dark. I can see lights in the distance through the trees. The lights from the front of all the houses and the streets never make it to the skinny Alleyways between the homes. Not much gets through.

I always like that.

I think about my day. I wonder if there was anything I could have said to the dry cleaner next time. I think briefly on Mrs Stinson, I really don't want to meet anybody.

I reset the reminder for next week when I call my mom, I put the additional note saying be more engaging.

I just sit there and spend a couple hours thinking. So alone and quiet here.

I always like that.

I consider the idea about getting up and going inside to go to bed, when I just started to cry.

Everything I've been thinking about just came pouring out.

I actually took a moment to look at the empty seat next to me. Which only caused me to cry some more.

I ask her why she left? I ask her if I'll ever see her again? I know no answer is coming. No answers have ever come. No answer can come. 

I never liked that.

I calm down enough to curl up in a ball in my chair and wait. It's only a matter of time before the sleeping pill kicks in as I think to myself. Couple hours go by and another good cry before I finally fall asleep.

I woke up in the chair again. I sit up and start stretching out my body. The cold has really stiffened me and I ache all over.

It's an hour before the sun begins to peek its eye over the horizon. Some of the dark blues are giving away to a light blue just ever slightly. 

Another day has begun.

I didn't like that. ",3,1765437405.0,story,2,1.0,False
1pjrdot,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pjrdot/i_wish_i_was_born_male_as_a_girl_deciding_her/,"I wish I was born male, as a girl deciding her career/future","Yo what’s up my fellow double Xers, this is probably a rant you’ve all seen before, but I really need to get it out as a teen girl rn. I’d like to preface this by saying I do not experience gender dysphoria, and that I simply wish I got to enjoy the privileges granted to men. 

I’m at the age where I’m considering college and my career and all that good future thinking. The problem? I’m an ambitious person that wants to get my bachelors + masters in engineering and work in nanotechnology as a biomedical engineer. Or, my other path is going to med school and becoming either a neuroradiologist or cardio electrophysiologist. Both are very intensive fields.

My dad is mentally stuck in at *most* the 1980s. He said that “women have the world handed to them.” Excuse me? And he got that from the experience in which his sister (my aunt) got free drinks at a club or bar or smth and he didn’t. Like that free drink probably isn’t safe. “Oh yay! A rohypnol cocktail!” Yk?😭 Going along with that, I’ve always had to work twice as hard (to be taken seriously among my peers as essentially the top of my class) than my male counterpart, even if he has lower grades than me. I scored a perfect score on a physics/chemistry standardized test and when my science teacher announced it (because he was proud of me), all the guys in the class went from excited to completely silent when he said “SHE is in this class.”

My mom said that what my dad probably meant is that having a career is optional for women, whereas men are “forced” to work. ?? She also said that what my dad probably thought was that, if a woman should please, she could get hella cosmetic surgery and find a sugar daddy (couldn’t tell if my mom agreed with this or not). And realistically, how many real life scenarios of the gold-digger x sugar daddy situation are there??

And my parents are always telling me that before or as I consider a career, I should be thinking about becoming a mom, or if I want to become a mom. They say, “We’ll be happy as long as you’re happy! ……….but you should like really have kids or you’re gonna be sad and alone in your 40s.” My mom isn’t dead set on me having kids though, at least. She said she just wants me to at least have a partner, which I agree with, but I just can’t picture the whole thing right now. I also have this looming guilt over my head now whenever I think about my potential careers. What am I even guilty for?? The nonexistent children? Ugh. (Funny story, I never played with baby dolls as a little kid, I would always grab one of my mom’s to-go coffee cups and put on her heels and pretend I was going to work. The signs were there gangalang).

I don’t know, I guess I’m jealous that men (in general) don’t have to deal with constantly considering fatherhood or something, they can just go to work and come home and that’s socially acceptable. They can just choose a career and go full steam ahead. But women are expected to cook, clean, nurture, and if they work, then that too, and they have to look all nice and sexy and Barbie-like while doing it. They’re expected to forgo passions. Wtf, man.

Also I have a little brother and it kinda hurts hearing how he’s so interested in astronomy and space, and he doesn’t have to worry about a goddamn thing if he wants to fully pursue it.

Lil side note, but I also feel like I’ll never be seen as “as smart” as a man, yk? Or, I’ll have to bust my ass 2x as much as man to do it. 

Also another thing my dad said when my mom asked him why he couldn’t help my little brother keep track of his assignments (lil bro has pretty bad adhd, poor guy’s getting diagnosed in January), he said “Dads just…aren’t good at that kind of stuff. We’re just not good in the house.” So now I’m worried, my mom’s going to postgrad school in January to become a nurse practitioner, and my dad basically expects her to keep the whole house, cook, help my little brother, and take care of us while she’s in school. And mom has gotten angry about being overworked many times, but once I point out the behavior that causes it, everything’s magically fine?? 

Sorry for the long rant, and sincere thanks if you read this whole thing.

Also I love my parents *A TON* so please be nice😅 <3333

1pjrd6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1pjrd6v/i_dont_want_to_take_part_in_my_friend_groups_gift/,I don't want to take part in my friend group's gift exchange,"I have a pretty big extended circle of friends that traditionally does an end of year party with a Dirty Santa gift exchange. For those who are unfamiliar, this is where everyone contributes one gift to the pile (with a cap of $50 for our group). We then randomly draw names. When your name is drawn you pick a gift, open it, and then choose whether to exchange it with one that someone else has already opened. The person you swap with cannot refuse. This generally means that you're better off being the last person drawn from the hat, since you can basically choose any gift from the entire pool. 

I hate this tradition. So much. It wasn't so bad at first when everyone contributed nice things, but at some point someone put in a 'joke' gift, and everyone thought it was so funny that everyone else started doing it too. I don't like giving joke gifts because I feel like it's mean, so I'm pretty much the only one who hasn't joined in on gag gifts. I usually contribute something that I made myself, which usually ends up being swapped around a lot.

The other side of this is more personal. I've lost the majority of my immediate family that I used to do Christmas with in just the past 3 years, and the other family and friends outside this group don't do gifts, so my holiday plans this year are essentially to go to this party and then spend a week eating fancy cheese on the couch with my dog. I'm honestly fine with this, but last year getting a novelty sex toy as my one and only gift felt like rubbing salt in the wound when I know the people who I would have exchanged loving and thoughtful gifts with aren't here anymore. Like I don't care if I get zero gifts at all, genuinely, but it really hurts if I get exactly one and it was deliberately chosen to suck real bad, you know? Especially now, especially when it happens multiple years in a row. 

This year's party is next week. The others are planning the party in the group chat. I've been weighing up either putting in something generic to the pool or just quietly bowing out of the gift exchange entirely. That was until yesterday, when I went out for coffee with one of the group members. She joked that everyone is really looking forward to 'the lottery', which is apparently what some of the group have been calling the exchange. I.e., the person who has their name drawn last is the winner because they inevitably get 'the grand prize', my gift. She even asked for hints on what I'm making and joked about rigging the name draw so she gets it. 

I said I haven't made anything and I'm thinking of just staying out of the exchange this year. She kept asking why and wouldn't leave it alone, so I explained everything above (embarrassingly I teared up a little bit, which I think neither of us was expecting so it felt really awkward lol) and said I don't want anything, I just want to not participate in the exchange. She said she would understand if I backed out but also (not unkindly) mentioned that the rest of the group is really looking forward to fighting over my contribution specifically, so I should probably talk to them about it, and that most of the group would probably understand and want to change the tradition if they knew how I feel. 

To be clear, I don't think anybody in the group has mean intentions and I think if I make a point to say something they'll probably be open to changing the rules... but idk if that's what I even want. Everyone else is having fun competing over giving the worst possible gift, and I will admit that they get really creative and I've found myself both amused and horrified by what they've come up with. I would just rather not be part of it. Also the group is really big, like 30-40 people, and has grown over the years to include a lot of people I don't know well and am not comfortable being vulnerable with. Maybe it's immature, but I flat out don't want to have to explain that the gifts they think are funny actually feel especially mean to me rn. But it sounds like simply backing out quietly and unnoticed isn't gonna be an option.

I 34F am in an open relationship with my partner Tim. We’re Poly and opened our relationship this year. We have a child and live together. We talked and did a lot of groundwork for about a year before opening. Prior to that I think we’d fall in the monogamish category because Tim was alway okay with me playing online and posting things. 

Andrew is someone I met about two years ago when Tim and I had separated and divorced (we reconciled quickly). Andrew and I fell out of contact but at the beginning of this year reconnected. He was also the first person I was with this year after Tim and I opened. He is however mono, so the only relationship he could offer was a FWB. We have grown close and the very first time we were together he even said if I wasn’t in a relationship he would partner me up so quickly.  There’s feelings on both sides, but this is all we get. He recently started talking to someone unexpectedly, he wasn’t looking, and things are looking like they may get serious which means it’s time for me to take a step back. He said I’d see him again in Jan when I’m back for work, but I don’t think it’s a good idea. He’s insisting and saying he’s going to take it slow with this new potential relationship. I deeply care about this man and while I want to see him happy, I’m devastated to be losing him. I’m struggling to support him in this new potential relationship and I hate myself for that. I am supporting him to be clear, but I cry (in private) every time. I would like to stay friends even if it is going to be difficult. 

On top of this I’m also potentially starting a BDSM dynamic with a Dominant. However this is early talks, but we did meet for coffee today and are both interested. That being said he’s never been with someone non monogamous and has some understandable hesitations. He is also located where I travel for work, so I’d only get to see him once a month. Same as Andrew, both live in another state.

Back home I have potential connections but they all seem to be sexually based. I had a potential Dom back home, John, who I’ve met once but he has HSV2 so that limits things. He’s also flaky and blames it on wanting time to go slowly because of his hesitations about his HSV. Which I totally respect. But it’s been 3 months since I’ve seen him. I’m not sure I want to shut down all other connections for someone unreliable, but I don’t want to hurt him and peace out now just because of his HSV. I also have a second person, Steven, back home that only wants sex, and that’s was never a relationship style I wanted to begin with, but he’s nice and very eager, and I’ll feel like I led him on if I don’t at least hookup with him once. 

I’m so overwhelmed and I know I’ve done this to myself. I really only wanted one romantic relationship and one kink dynamic in addition to my nesting partner. But I feel like people being flaky, my difficulty with self advocacy, and the distance of some partners has led me to have too much going on. And losing Andrew feels like it’s devastating me right now even though that was never going to be more. 

I’m trying to figure out how to pull back, which connections to let go of and how to do that without hurting those people. How to be more clear and not get invested in things that aren’t what I’m looking for moving forward",0,1765436781.0,nonmonogamy,7,0.25,False
1pjr7v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pjr7v3/fulfilled_yuzu/,Fulfilled Yuzu,"Writing because for the first time in a long time, I feel lighter.

I think there is something special about walking down grocery aisles *with* you. We didn't always pick the essentials, sometimes it was about just about finding an oddity at the store and that would make our day. We didn't fight over the bills, and we shared a love for packaged drinks, anything with a cute label. Our affection for each other was like enjoying the nicknacks of life. Sometimes that would look like getting excited over packaged separated quality beef...I'd like to cling on to that memory of us because what's the point of holding onto a memory of us that feels fueled with embedded zest? And no, you can't keep another bottle just because it was a part of the design, our apartment is already filled to the brim with repackaged drinks. Sounds familiar? 

But that was a century ago, some time has passed since we ventured apart. I would like to think it was a part of the journey that I was prepared for but we aren't always prepared for things that are always thrown our way zealously. I couldn't keep up with making jugs of lemonade every time we decided that we weren't playing a certain character that we were trying to keep up with. Every time we would separate, was like buying into the off brand of Yuzu. Not entirely the right type of tartness we wanted on the daily but acceptable because that's what we thought was okay with accepting. It wasn't entirely like *calmansi either,* but that's what we would drink when we were back to playing into our roles. I think there is a bit of sadness leftover from when we last spoke, and outside of our inner circle of influences. It felt nice to not make lemonade every day literally and not figuratively. We both knew we couldn't keep up with this lifestyle. 

I've been working on myself a lot this year, grounding myself in new habits, getting new certifications, I read alone at the park a lot this year reflecting, trying to not get caught up in new trends, whether that was imbued by our favourite drinks or not. Trying new coffee shops because you taught me it was okay to be introverted and to explore that part of myself. Connecting to places that felt like home, reminiscent to before we met and dated. I caught up on old friendships, job searched whenever I had free time, toured apartments, I felt like I was filling my own cup but this time without you. I think what made me feel stuck was I didn't know where I wanted to go next. There was a point in time where I thought I wasn't going to be okay, that I wouldn't make it to the other side unscathed by our shared experiences. It still hurts to walk by our favourite restaurants, places that we found odd quirk memorabilia. But it's silently walking by those places and accepting that we once enjoyed these corners together was what once made these places special. There were a lot of round a bouts I had to endure along the way but the whole point of finding myself on this thread was that I could hear testimonies and stories of what other people have gone through in their relationships. I wanted to experience hardships through the lens of many because it almost feels like we're making lemonade together. I'm sorry if you're allergic to any zest by the way. But ultimately, I don't feel any ache from us parting anymore and I hope you've been investing in yourself as well.

I first visited my grandfather the summer I turned eleven, when my parents left me with him while they traveled overseas. He lived far from town, in a creaking old house pressed up against the edge of a forest so dense that even the morning sun couldn’t slip through the trees. The locals called it the Ghost House. My parents laughed it off whenever I asked why, but they never quite answered the question, and their smiles looked a little too tight. I didn’t think much about it until the day I arrived.

The moment I stepped inside, the air changed. It wasn’t colder, but it felt heavier, like stepping into a room where someone had been whispering just moments before. The wooden walls had that deep, resinous smell of old pine, but underneath it lingered the faint scent of something sweet and spoiled, like apples left in a bowl too long. The hallway stretched in front of me, long and narrow, with old lamps hanging from the ceiling at a slight tilt, as if someone had pulled on them again and again.

Grandpa didn’t offer explanations. He just said, “Come along,” and gave me a pat on the shoulder that felt more like a warning than a welcome. The floor creaked under his boots, but the boards barely made a sound under my feet. I noticed this immediately. I also noticed that the creaking didn’t stop when *both* of us had stopped walking.

He led me upstairs to a small guest room with a nailed-shut window and an old mirror across from the bed. The mirror bothered me right away, it was too clean, too bright, and the reflection came back just a blink slower than my movements. When I lifted my hand, the boy in the mirror lifted his a beat late, as if he had to remember the gesture before copying it. I didn’t say anything at first. I thought maybe I was tired.

But I wasn’t tired that night. I didn’t sleep.

The second the lights were off, the house seemed to lean closer around me. The silence wasn’t real silence, it was listening silence. Something about it reminded me of walking through the school library when the old librarian watched you from behind the desk even though she never moved or spoke.

Around midnight, footsteps started in the hallway. Slow ones. Cautious ones. They made their way toward my door, paused right outside it like someone adjusting their ear to the crack, then moved away again. A minute later they came back, paused, retreated. It was a rhythm, almost steady, like someone curious but unsure.

Once, I heard a faint breath on my cheek, warm, almost human. I jerked upright and stared into the dark, my heart pounding so loudly I felt it in my teeth. No one was there, but the silence deepened, thick like fog.

The worst part happened around three in the morning. The floorboard at the end of my bed groaned under weight that wasn’t mine. I watched in the faint moonlight as the rug dipped down beneath a single footprint. Just one. Perfectly formed, pressing into the fibers as if someone, or something, stood there very still.

I didn’t make a sound. I couldn’t.

In the morning, when Grandpa saw how pale I looked, he didn’t laugh or tell me I’d imagined things. He just squinted at me and said, “Ah. So you met one of them.” When I asked what he meant, he only shrugged and told me to follow him outside to help with chores.

The day wasn’t any kinder. The hallway brushed against me. I know that sounds strange, but that’s how it felt, like something brushed my arm with small, quick fingers, almost apologetically, like a child reaching out to hold hands. In the living room, the clocks all ticked off-beat, each one with its own impatient tempo, and they abruptly stopped whenever I came close enough to touch one. I tried once, reaching out, not even to touch the clock, just to hover my hand near it, and its ticking died instantly, as though holding its breath.

The shadows were wrong, too. Whenever I went downstairs, my shadow stretched across the wall, but there was always an extra one, just behind mine, thinner and bending strangely at the joints, following me a second too late. I tried staring at it hard, daring it to stop or vanish, but it only stayed perfectly still. When I glanced away for the briefest moment, even to blink, it shifted positions.

The basement door was the place I avoided most. It was an old wooden door at the very end of the hall, and it always seemed to be breathing. The wood swelled and sank with a slow rhythm that didn’t match the temperature in the house or the draft that moved through the hallways at night. Sometimes the doorknob twitched, the tiniest movement, as though someone inside wanted to test whether it was locked. And behind the door came tapping. Not random tapping, not frantic tapping. Measured tapping. Three taps. A pause. Four taps. A pause. Like counting steps in the dark.

I asked Grandpa why his basement sounded alive. He looked up from his gardening with the most exhausted expression I’d ever seen on his face, wiped sweat from his forehead, and said, “Don’t open it. Don’t even linger near it.” He didn’t say why. He didn’t have to.

By the third night, I wasn’t sure which ghost belonged to which sound or shadow or whisper. I wasn’t even sure how many there really were. Grandpa had once muttered that he had “at least five,” but the uncertainty in the way he said *at least* nested in my mind like a splinter.

All I knew was that I didn’t want to meet the newest one, the long, thin shadow that bent like a broken marionette.

On the final night of my stay, I woke to heat, not cold. A sudden wave of warmth pressed against me, like someone leaning close to my ear. When I sat up, all the clocks in the house erupted at once. Every single one. From the kitchen. From the living room. From the hallway. A clashing, clanging confusion of midnight chimes and noon chimes and six o’clock bells, all out of step, all crashing together in a warped, chaotic chorus.

The wallpaper seemed to pulse. The shadows thickened, rippling like something alive just beneath the surface of the walls. The mirror flickered, not with my reflection, but with movements too fast and too many to belong to only one thing.

And then the basement door began to open.

Not quickly. Slowly. Painfully. Wood grinding against wood, hinges squealing in protest, the sound of something large trying to push its way out of a place it had been held far too long.

Grandpa came hurtling down the hallway with his lantern, face pale, hair wild. I’d never seen him look frightened before, not truly. But he was terrified then.

“Stay back,” he hissed, grabbing the door and trying to force it shut. “Don’t come closer. Don’t let it see you.”

But the thing behind the door pushed harder. The wood bowed outward. The nails squealed. The tapping from inside grew louder, faster, frantic, as though counting down to something.

Then, from the darkness below, a voice whispered my name.

Not my full name.  
Not the one teachers called.  
My baby name, the one only my mother used when I was very small.

Hearing it come from down there, deep, damp, and hungry, froze every inch of me.

I ran.  
I don’t remember choosing to run. My body just moved on its own. I bolted up the stairs, slammed my bedroom door, and pressed myself against it while the house moaned and the clocks screamed and something enormous scraped its way up the basement steps. I squeezed my eyes shut until the noise collapsed into silence.

In the morning, everything was strangely calm. My parents arrived early, saying they’d finished their trip sooner than expected. Grandpa waited on the porch, looking exhausted but composed, sipping coffee like nothing had happened. The basement door behind him was boarded shut, thick new planks nailed over it, the wood splintered and bent around the nails as though something inside had clawed at them before they were even dry.

He hugged me goodbye and whispered, “Good boy. You didn’t answer.” And that was all he said.

When we drove away, I stared at the Ghost House through the back window until the trees swallowed it. I tried to convince myself it was only an old house and a series of bad dreams.

But sometimes, even now, I wake in the middle of the night with the feeling that something warm and patient is leaning close to my ear. I’ll lie perfectly still, barely breathing, while the air hums with a silence too heavy to be empty.

Sometimes I’ll walk past a window and see two silhouettes where there should only be one, mine standing stiff and honest, and another stretched thin behind it, bent in ways that don’t belong to any living thing. It always vanishes when I turn my head, as if caught doing something it shouldn’t.

Some nights I hear faint tapping from the walls. Three taps. A pause. Four taps. A pause. Counting. Always counting. I tell myself it’s the house settling, or pipes, or my imagination. But I know that rhythm too well, deep down where children remember the things adults tell them to forget.

The worst is the whisper.

I don’t hear it often. Weeks go by with nothing. Then at the edge of sleep, the darkness shifts, and from somewhere impossibly close, just beneath the floorboards, or just behind my pillow, I hear it say my baby name in that same gentle, coaxing tone.

Like someone calling a pet home.

I never answer. I don’t dare.

But last week, I woke up to find muddy footprints on the hallway carpet. Small ones, as if they belonged to a child, or something that wanted to seem like one. They stopped right outside my bedroom door. Right beside where I sleep.

And this morning, when I stepped out of bed, the rug dipped beneath my foot… even though mine was the only one there.

As I write this, the room feels too warm. The air feels expectant. Something is standing just behind me, I can feel the weight of its stillness, the way the quiet tightens around it. I know, without turning, that it’s there.

I can feel it leaning closer. The warmth presses against the back of my neck, not breath exactly, but the memory of breath, like something practicing how to imitate being alive. The floorboards behind me creak softly, then go silent, as if it realized I noticed.

I don’t turn around.

I keep writing because the sound of the pen on paper is the only thing that proves I’m still here, still separate from whatever has followed me. If I stop, I’m afraid I’ll hear it move again.

There’s another whisper now. Not my baby name this time. Something lower, rougher. Almost disappointed. It drags along the floor, thick and wet, before rising behind me like a draft from an open cellar door.

I squeeze my eyes shut.  
I tell myself if I don’t look, it can’t pull me back.

But then the room shifts. Not physically, nothing falls or shakes, but the air folds inward, like the walls have leaned close to listen.

And just above my ear, so close the words vibrate against my skin, it speaks again.

“Come back.”

When I arrived, I was asked to pay a AU$50 security deposit for the two nights. That’s £25 or about 33 American dollars.

  
I have the money in my account, but I object to this practice in principle. Particularly when I walked into the room and it was filthy!

A few years ago, I was away with work and they booked me a room at the Hilton. Far from a budget hotel but not the Ritz either. They asked me to pay a security deposit (similar price) there too. I asked for the charge to be invoiced to my employer (they had booked the room for me) but they said that this wasn’t possible. So I had to pay with my own card.

  


**A list of my grievances about this phenomenon:**

\- I can’t imagine that this is effective – who on earth has ever thought “Oh, I was going to get drunk/high and trash this hotel room but now I need my measly $50 back so I shan’t bother!”.

\- $50 isn’t going to discourage the theft of big ticket items like the television or coffee machine or whatever - matters that should be dealt with by the police in any case.

\- I can only imagine that the purpose of this for smaller hotels is to make sly money on the side? People forget to collect their cash deposit and just leave. Or businesses that “accidentally“ never refund the money and guests completely forget about it.

\- What’s annoying is that both my trips were booked through hotelsdotcom - surely they should/could have a mechanism whereby they can retain that money from my account if the hotel presents evidence that I’ve left the room in a dreadful state or stolen something? And of course, this security deposit was hidden in their small print!

\- Imagine the amount of interest that these hotel chains are making on all of these security deposits. Particularly global chains like the Hilton – they must keep thousands upon thousands in their accounts each day purely based off these deposits, The vast majority of which will be returned.

\- Nobody is ever given an inventoryOf their Hotel room when they check in – they could easily say that a towel is missing just to keep the money. By which time, you Gone home or moved on and have no way of contesting this unless you took a bunch of photos (which I will be doing).

\- Lots of people safer and Simmons to go away and I’ve suddenly hit With this BS extra charge, even if it is refundable at the end of the stay.",0,1765436665.0,PetPeeves,0,0.5,False

I’ve started taking 10mg 3 weeks ago for my anxiety and panic attacks that would hinder my everyday functioning. So far, I’m feeling better. I still feel anxious sometimes, but it feels like the sharp edges of my thoughts are gone and I have this feeling that I can handle them. Luckily, I also sleep better. I’m a bit afraid to “jinx” it though, or that it is currently just a placebo effect. 

I had a few questions I’d like to hear your experiences on: 

1) How long dit it take you to fully adjust and to conclude that it was working for you?

2) If so, when and why was it decided to increase your dosage?

3) What are your experiences with caffeine?


I have not spoken about a roadmap or something for dosage increase with my GP, so that’s why I’m interested in your experiences with that especially since I’m on a relatively low dosage. 
And I have read that caffeine is something to avoid as well, but I’m having a hard time letting go of my morning coffees. 🫠I’m switching to decaf now, so any experiences with caffeine that affected you are welcome too!

1pjr5e4,https://i.redd.it/lwdq9rt6xi6g1.jpeg,Is this traditional tea set suitable for a 22-year-old beginner tea enthusiast? 🫖☕️,"Hi everyone! I’m looking for advice on a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, and my budget is about 200 RMB. 🎁 He’s 23, a serious coffee enthusiast (certified barista with all the gear ☕️), and has recently started exploring tea. He’s very much a beginner, still figuring out his tastes, and has mentioned that tea in China is much more affordable than specialty coffee beans.

I found this gift set online for 133 RMB (image attached). It includes:

· Teaware: A teapot and 4 matching cups. 🫖
· Tea Samples: Small amounts of several well-known Chinese teas (Jin Jun Mei black tea, Da Hong Pao oolong, Rou Gui oolong, Fuding white tea, and aged tangerine peel white tea). 🍃
· Packaging: Full gift box with a handle bag. 🎀

I’m considering it because it seems like a complete and affordable introduction kit, but I have a few concerns:

1. Age & Style Fit: This looks like a very traditional set. I often see these marketed for older generations or as gifts for parents/in-laws. Would a 23-year-old guy, who’s into modern coffee culture, likely appreciate this, or find it too formal or dated? 🤔
2. Beginner Friendliness: For someone used to coffee precision, is a sampler set like this a good way to explore different tea types? 🧐
3. Quality Concern: Is the tea in these pre-boxed gift sets (especially at this price point) usually decent quality, or is it often lower-grade? 📦

I’d really value input from tea lovers, especially younger ones or those who also enjoy specialty coffee. Is this a thoughtful starter kit within my budget, or should I look for something else with a more modern vibe?

We brought her home exactly a week ago. She seemed to accept us as new owners almost immediately. The breeder told us that she fed her [Royal Canin Puppy kibble](https://i.imgur.com/Wph6YZL.png) (chicken protein), which we are not very fond of, therefore we bought [Ontario Puppy Lamb kibble](https://i.imgur.com/sVhGQXc.png) (lamb), which is considered a ""superpremium"" brand in Europe.

Day 1: So, we got her home after 3 hours of drive, and immediatelly fed her a portion of Ontario food. I know we made a huge mistake her, as we didn't slowly transition her from Royal Canin to Ontario. Anyway, she felt super happy.

Day 2: That day we scheduled an appointment with vet for routine check-up. In the morning we fed her Ontario food again and in the afternoon as well. She also had soft stool that day. However, on the way to the vet she vomited 3 times, 3rd time being almost only liquid. The vet prescribed Sucralfate and also GI wet food. 

  
The following days she hasn't vomited at all and her stool turned normal again on the day 3. We kept her on GI food and Sucralfate for 3 days (until the end of the day 4).

Day 5: We started giving her Kibble again, this time 75% Royal canin and 25% ontario. We decided we were going to keep the transition slow. Throughout the day we also gave her some kibble treats made of chicken liver

Day 6 was normal - a slightly softer stool with paler color, but no diarrhea or vomiting. 

Day 7: We noticed she was really fast eater, eating he food with no chewing. We got her one of those bowls that has sort of labyrinth on the bottom to make her eat slower. Kept her on 75% Royal Canin and 25% Ontario lamb. She was totally fine throughout the day until the evening. My girlfriend and I had a snack on the couch and she tried to get to it by all means. After multiple attempts of letting her now that trying to jump on the coffee table and get the snacks is not acceptable, we put her in her playpen. She cried for a few minutes, then she calmed down. After we had our snack we let her out, gave her a chicken liver kibble treat, and then she lay next to us. She vomited again 2 times.

Day 8: We woke up, she was super happy again to see us, wagging her tail, took her out to pee. Gave her a chicken liver kibble treat, then took her inside. After resting for some time she vomited again. This time only foam with water as her stomach has been empty for the last 8 hours.

  
Now I do not know how to proceed. Should I put her back to GI food? What am I doing wrong? I don't want to feed her Ontario food if that makes her vomit, while at the same time I am not sure what exactly makes her vomit. Could it be Chicken liver treat? Should I put her back to Royal Canin kibble?

First post (YAY!) also having to post here (OOF!). Changed names for anonymity (you know the drill) also I don't think anyone on the site actually knows me, and I am more certain my roommate doesn't have reddit so this is my main (OMG!!!).

I am at a dorm in Uni, and while at an older age for getting my B.A. (by the standards I was raised with) at the age of 26, this is the first time I am actually living on my own. I am going to try and be as factual and honest with what I write, but if there're any questions I am happy to clarify.

  
Sorry for the long intro, now for the details:

I am a 25 (turning 26 in a few days YAY!) dude (studying Performance-Based learning design and Microbiology). my flatmates in my dorm (2 bedroom 4 beds) are Joe (22M studying PolySci) and Glen (21M Studying psych) (Surf's up fans anyone?) I am lucky to have a room of my own. Joe is chill as hell, love the guy, he has a lot of interesting opinions that are very analytical and academic, which are fun to discuss/debate with him. Joe also is a clean and mature man. Joe understands that he is living in a shared space and treats it as such. Joe and I actually have a few disagreements, however they are all on discussion-able topics and none on general cleanliness and living-states. Joe moved in a month in to the semester after he had a roommate (who was 52) that suggested intent to kill Joe (crazy I know!) so I understand that there are crazier situations in this world and with roommates/flatmates.

Glen. Glen is interesting. He has the opportunity to be a chill dude, and honestly he is. He is invested in weightlifting (we love that), and is generally overall a kind guy (we also love that). Unfortunately that's as far as that goes. Glen seems to have an inability to be aware of his surroundings and the stark contrast between the environment Joe and I create and that Glen creates. Glen also portrays himself as super macho, whilst also fully lacking in any form of machismo.

  
If you're confused so far I am sorry. Let me explain.

Things Joe and I do:  
\- Buy household goods (toilet paper, air fresheners, kitchen roll, dorm flat decorations, blankets, pillows, Lysol wipes, etc.  
\- Wiping the tables after we use them to maintain general cleanliness.  
\- Washing dishes.  
\- Shopping for shared goods (cookie dough, alcohol, again decorations)  
\- We close the toilet lid after using the toilet (as a microbiology enthusiast I don't like the idea of fecal matter everywhere)  
\- keeping our items out of the shared spaces.  
\- focusing on making sure we leave things better than we met them.

Glen's whole deal:  
\- Consistently leaving dishes in the sink  
\- Leaving sticky grease stains on the counters and stove  
\- Bare-feet on the coffee table  
\- Leaves the toilet seat up  
\-? Washes his hands by...clapping them together??? I've seen him ""wash"" his hands with my own eyes, he literally cups his hands and just...claps...   
\- He is the only one in the flat that uses the dishwasher and yet he rarely runs it, I've never seen him take any dishes out of it, and he has left it stagnant for so long that on multiple occasions when its been opened Joe and I have to vacate the area (dramatic sounding I know but full honesty)  
\- He also hasn't bought any items for the dorm (toilet paper, kitchen roll, cleaning supplies, etc.)  
\- He often says he could fight us and win, as well as bragging about going to juvenile retention and being a delinquent during his time of mental growth.  
\- Glen takes pride in mispronouncing words to mess with people (which I can't understand since he wants to be a professional??? saying literately instead of literally, I ""fucks"" with which I understand that it is a colloquialism however he uses it in a professional setting as well which baffles me. he also is learning Spanish and says ""Y"" the word for and as ""why"" because he likes to annoy people.)  
\- (Not a big thing that affects me but I'm petty, he leaves his record for his record player out of their sleeves and just in a loose stack.)

Now some crazy updates to our lives.

Glen was in a relationship with a ""Freshly 18 year old"" his words (eww I know, glen claims she was 19 but when we looked at her tinder later it still said 18) and then whilst getting nowhere with the ""freshly 18 year old"" he got a message from an other girl (21F) (fake named from this point as Ci Ci) and Ci Ci started her conversation with ""Are you dating anyone right now?"" (suggestive and priming a possible relationship I know). Anyway, Glen is a young man who is interested in losing his virginity (a big thing for him which I can't really comment on because I don't share the same sentiment) so like a remora on a shark he jumped on the opportunity. Ci Ci kept leading him on (pet-names, morning texts, late night and over night visits) but stating she doesn't want a boyfriend and only to be friends, but he kept wanting to lose his virginity and she kept leading him on and shutting him down, Joe and I told him to be cautious and not move too fast and that she is leading him on and he in a final culmination Glen told Ci Ci the advice we were giving him and told her we didn't like her (Untrue the two times we met she was super chill.) anyway they broke up. Glen seemed to have gotten better after a slight dip (understandable considering the circumstances) and we were back to the above issues. (There is so much more to this story but that is another post)

Then some other shift happened. Slowly at first but it culminated a fortnight ago when he came home truly PLASTERED (he took 14 shots of vodka BEFORE he left to go drinking with friends). (I'd like to preface this with the fact that Glen is currently depressed and ill, so we are cautious and not wanting to be too intense, but Joe and I are at our wits end). Glen has been a bit snappy lately with us, calling me out for letting a pot soak in the sink for an hour (compared to the dishes of his that were at the time in the sink for three days), laying on every piece of furniture in the shared space without disinfecting anything, and more (to be listed.)

Here is the new things Joe and I are dealing with, with Glen (in addition to all the previous things:  
\- Glen LITERALLY moans/groans every 8 seconds, truly literally no exaggeration.  
\- He is defecating and then not washing his hands and touching everything.  
\- (MY OWN PERSONAL HELL, he wiped his ass and left the excrement covered toilet paper on the ground and I (braving walking in the dorm with bare feet) stepped on it (I'm going to be sick))  
\- Glen is literally dispensing a reek that fills all spaces of the flat (again bless Joe who is Glen's roommate)  
\- Glen is leaving fecal matter on the TP roll that is on the roller  
\- Glen refuses to go to the doctor for his illness  
\- Glen clogged the toilet and left it  
\- The day he came back plastered we put him in the tub, which he then filled fully and fell asleep in almost drowning himself (YIKES)  
\- He has defecated himself a few times

Additional Glen info, Glen brags about making $2k from selling drugs at freshman homecoming. He broke his elbow at the same time Ci Ci messaged him, and instead of going to the ER glen went to Ci Ci's flat to spend the night, then the next day he went to the ER (I Drove him Both times), Glen then told me to ""be ready by 8am"" the next day, his way of asking if I could take him to a doctors the night before his appointment. While at the doctors when he was asked if he had a ride to his surgery he confidently said yes (referring to me) without asking me (thank God I was in the room). In addition, I have washed Glens dishes for him, I have offered to drive him home (we don't live too far from each other only a few hours) for both autumn break and winter break because I am kind and the offer was extended before all the crazy and I am a man of my word, I have built him from scratch a budgeting sheet with code on google sheets after finding him sobbing to himself in the corner of the shared space because he had -$7 (somehow Glen is the only one of the three of us with a job so WTH), I have also had three talks with him ranging from; 1. Hey man could you be a little tidier please?, 2. Hey man here is the psychological effects and research on being untidy (Thank god I have educated parents who taught me a lot as well and gave me the power to speak to Glen in terms he is studying), and 3. (after the soaking pot situation) Hey Glen, you're being disrespectful and are not providing a comfortable environment for us all in this shared space. each convo ends with Glen saying ""I'm sorry, I've been a bad roommate."" which at first I softened, but now I did not negate. However he isn't changing and I just want to yell to Glen ""You aren't sorry since you aren't changing!""

This may be more a rant than anything but I am losing it. Joe and I are going to call him out next semester if nothing changes. if I don't blow up first.

Anyway, have fun reading, I hope SMOSH gets this because that would be funny to see read out, and have a great day!",0,1765435186.0,AIO,16,0.48,False
1pjqqyu,https://scitechdaily.com/dark-chocolate-compound-linked-to-slower-aging/,Dark Chocolate Compound Linked To Slower Aging (4 min read) | SciTechDaily: Health [Dec 2025],"**Scientists have discovered that theobromine, the same compound that gives dark chocolate its signature bitterness, may help keep the body biologically younger.**

*By analyzing DNA aging markers and telomere length in over 1,600 people, researchers found that higher blood levels of theobromine were linked to a younger biological age.*

# Dark Chocolate Compound Linked to Biological Aging

A naturally occurring compound in dark chocolate may help slow certain signs of biological aging. Researchers at King’s College London report that theobromine, a plant chemical found in cocoa, shows potential anti-aging effects in humans.

The new findings, published today (December 10) in *Aging*, examined how theobromine levels in the bloodstream relate to molecular indicators of aging.

# How Scientists Measured Biological Age

Biological age is used to estimate how well the body is functioning compared with a person’s actual years lived. These measurements rely on DNA methylation, which refers to small chemical tags that act as regulatory marks on our DNA and shift gradually as we grow older.

In two major European study groups, consisting of 509 participants from TwinsUK and 1,160 from KORA, individuals with higher circulating levels of theobromine tended to have a biological age that appeared younger than their true age.

Professor Jordana Bell, senior author and Professor in Epigenomics at King’s College London, explained: “Our study finds links between a key component of dark chocolate and staying younger for longer. While we’re not saying that people should eat more dark chocolate, this research can help us understand how everyday foods may hold clues to healthier, longer lives.”

# Theobromine Stands Out Among Cocoa and Coffee Compounds

The team also evaluated other substances found in cocoa and coffee to see if they produced the same effect. The results suggested that theobromine was the compound most closely tied to the observed aging differences.

To estimate biological age, the researchers used two types of assessments. One focused on chemical changes in DNA that indicate the pace of aging. The second measured telomere length. Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes, and shorter telomeres are typically associated with aging and age-related health problems.",2,1765435057.0,NeuronsToNirvana,0,1.0,False

I never knew about my first daughter until 10 years ago when she was 16, her mother died and she and CPS reached out to me, I had no clue she existed and she explained everything and we did a dna test and she was indeed my daughter, I of course took her in, my wife protested at first but I told her I’m not throwing my own daughter into the system even if I didn’t know she existed, I know multiple people who were foster care kids and they all said it was horrible, I spent alot of time bonding and getting to know her back then, at first she was withdrawn from me and she seemed scared, and I get it poor kid just lost her mom, but she opened up to me and we became really close, at first she either called me by my name or father but started calling me dad about 8 months into her staying with me, I’ve been a dad by then for well over a decade but hearing it from her felt special I don’t know, my wife and kids never really liked her or her staying with us but I told them she’s as much my family as they were and that as long as I was alive this was her house too. 

At 18 she moved away for college, she was a really smart girl and got many scholarships, I hadn’t saved as much for her like my other kids because I only did for two years on my own without my wife’s help but I still helped her out out of pocket as much as I could, she was always thankful for the help and even got a part time job at the coffee place at her college, I was always proud of her, she’s now a lawyer working in a big law office with a great salary. As soon as she started making real money she offered to pay me back for everything and I just called her crazy and refused to take a single cent from her. While she was at college she met this nice young man and they fell in love hard and they just got married last week. 

She asked me to walk her down the aisle which I happily accepted, but my wife and daughter completely flipped out, they said I shouldn’t walk her down because my other daughter was the first daughter in my life and she deserved to be the first one I walked down the aisle, I said that’s complete bullshit and that I loved them both the same and that they’re both my daughters, and that my oldest deserves to have her dad on her big day, they still argued and we had many fights about it and they even argued with my daughter and she ended up uninviting both of them and I honestly didn’t blame her. I went to the wedding and I walked my daughter down the aisle and gave her away and we had a father daughter dance and she even dedicated part of her speech about me and how much she loved me and it honestly made me cry like a little baby. 

Now they’re still angry that I even went to the wedding at all let alone walking her down the aisle, I called them crazy for wanting me to miss my own daughter’s wedding and I called them selfish. Neither of them are speaking to me right now.

**Int. Gabriel’s House (Evening) October 29, 2025, 7:30 P.M.**

Gabriel’s face had sweat dripping down, his eyebrows were scrunched up, his eyes closed as he focused on holding himself up in the air. Nadia has been having Gabriel train with making different constructs with his mind. Like right now, he has been sitting cross-legged in the air with a small platform. For only two days of having powers, Gabriel feels like he has been having a better time of controlling them. The saddest thing he learned about his abilities is that you need a high imagination to be able to use them, an area that he himself is sadly lacking in. He’d probably have to watch some cartoons or read some comic books to probably come up with new ideas to use his abilities. Sigh, that's one of the downsides of his powers, another is that they work better if he is calm.

So far, he has only tested the blue color, which is him being sad or depressed. Ironically, it gives him an ability similar to flames; it also laces his constructs with flames, which is how he was able to burn the woman vampire to death. The darker the color blue, the stronger the flames are and will be. The only other color he has unlocked at the moment was red, which is based on how angry or embarrassed he will be. It boosts all physical attributes and makes him stronger with a small aura-like shield surrounding his body. The downside is making it harder for him to make constructs, still possible, but harder. All those constructs tend to be more violent in nature, but that's a whole different thing for Gabriel to think about.

Gabriel opened his eyes and decided to dismiss the platform he was sitting on. Landing softly on his feet, Gabriel walked towards the patio, stepping up the small step, he walked towards the table and used the towel to wipe the sweat off of his brow. Despite him wearing a sleeveless shirt, and the weather being around forty degrees with no sun in the sky, he felt very warm, as if it was a normal sunny day. Opening up the back sliding door, he made his way into his house, making sure to shut the door behind himself. At the kitchen table was Nadia, typing away on her Macbook. Paperwork surrounded her, making the table very messy. “Ugh, I’ve been digging around all the records surrounding the warehouse, and so far the only thing I found was the name Corson.”

Gabriel grabbed a bottle of water out of the refrigerator, walking around the table, taking a seat across from Nadia. “Thomas, huh? Did you find out what year the deed was signed over?”

Nadia ruffled through the multiple papers on the table, her lips turned downwards. “Ugh, it was some old guy back in the 1920s who bought it,” she answered, finally finding a document and handing it to Gabriel.

Gabriel took the document from her hand, realizing it was a deed, with writing barely legible. “Welp, does this Thomas have any living family members?”

Nadia grabbed her hair in annoyance, pulling at the strands as she stared at the ceiling. “That’s the major issue. Apparently, his son had two daughters, one named Chloe, and another Ava. Chloe died back in 2002 at the age of twenty-six.” She explained. Nadia lowered her head to stare at the laptop screen. “I’ve been digging through the internet searching for Ava Thomas, but no one with that name in the city has popped. There are others around the US with that name, but they’re either too young or too old to be the one we are looking for.”

Nadia turned the laptop around, allowing Gabriel to see a death certificate for one Chloe Thomas. Reading on, he found that she was mauled to death by an animal in the city, or at least that was what is listed. “How much would you want to bet that she was killed by some demon or something?” he contemplated.

“That’s a fool’s bet, after what the Captain told us about how they do their best to cover up demonic issues that happen,” Nadia argued.

Gabriel nodded his head in agreement, not having a reply since she was correct. When going back to the police station after the events on Monday, the Captain had him meet in his car (which was strange), but he informed Gabriel of a lot of things Blake didn’t inform him of, such as how the average person can’t see demons or monsters. Instead, it’ll be more like a ghost, or for some people, they’ll believe it’s a trick of the mind. It’s all part of the pact signed by some King and Lucifer back two thousand or so years ago, which explains why folklore or myths can be so detailed since at one point they all existed amongst humans. “Have you checked on Blake yet?” Gabriel asked, wanting to change the topic.

Nadia looked up from the laptop. “Yeah, his fever died down, and the worst of his wounds have closed. At this point, we are just waiting for him to wake up on his own.”

Gabriel just let out a sigh, standing up from the table and walking into the living room. With only two bedrooms usable, one of which is occupied by Blake, he has been allowing Nadia to use his bedroom (even though she could usually just go home), since she has been crashing with him as well. Not that it’s a problem, he has a nice pull-out couch. The third bedroom was an office/junk room that pretty much had his childhood in it. Sitting down on the couch, he held the business card that held Alucard’s name on it.

**Int. Gabriel’s House (Morning) October 30, 2025, 7:30 A.M.**

Gabriel opened up to the familiar ceiling of his front room, looking at the fan above his head. He laid there for a moment, thinking over the whole case so far. From his old notes that were taken, he was still confused on the dates. It doesn’t make sense why this group would kidnap people and hold them for so long. Though it’ll make sense if he was using it for some ritual or something, being demons. Gabriel let out a huge sigh; it feels like his entire life has been flipped upside down. Between discovering he has powers, and learning to control them, then finding out creatures of myths do exist, it's just a lot for him. Gabriel sat up from the couch and was startled to find Blake was just sitting there, drinking coffee out of a mug, looking back at him.

Blake raised the mug as a way of greeting. “Good morning, sunshine. It took you a while to wake up.”

Gabriel's mouth opened, then closed, resembling a fish trying to grab food. “How long have you been sitting here?” he asked. He turned his head to the right to look at the time before looking back at Blake. “It’s freaking seven in the morning, were you just sitting there waiting for me to wake up?”

“I woke up at five, and colored me surprised that it wasn't in a hospital bed but in a strange house I’ve never seen before,” Blake commented, taking a sip from his coffee.

Gabriel let out a deep sigh, his entire body sagging from exhaustion. He held out his hand and made a white dagger appear in his hand. Blake just raised an eyebrow as he studied the light construct. “When fighting the vampires, like a lock or something clicked, then I found myself able to control light particles,” He explained, turning the dagger into a ball, tossing it up in the air before letting it dissolve.

Gabriel felt Blake’s lack of reaction mildly concerning, granted it would make sense if Blake has been around dealing with similar stuff. “I never expected for you to gain abilities, or something like that. I guess, I thought one of the holy relics would come to you.”

“Holy relics?” Gabriel questioned, swinging his legs off the couch, placing them on the floor.

Blake took a quick sip out of his coffee mug. “There are five holy relics that can only be used by humans, and were made to fight against demons. Well, not just demons, but the creatures of the underworld in general.”

Gabriel took a moment to comprehend the information. Eventually, he’s going to have to take down notes because this is a lot of information for him to keep up with and remember. “Holy relics were made by the church? Also, how are they passed down?”

“I don’t have the answers to that. I’d like to believe they were a gift from God to help save people, but that's something to ask the higher-ups. Out of the five, two have been destroyed, with one lost in history. The only one accounted for is mine. The objects have some semblance of sentience, leaving people they find unworthy or have died in battle,” Blake answered, setting the mug down on the coffee table. He showed the watch to Gabriel, allowing the natural sunlight to shine off of it. “This may look normal, albeit a fancy wristwatch, but it can become a shield that emits holy light. Dangerous toward creatures I mentioned before.”

Gabriel looked at the shield, and felt a sense of familiarity with it, and even when Blake switched it back to a watch. Like a memory fighting to resurface, but all Gabriel felt was a headache as he tried to understand where he had seen that watch before. “I think we need to separate for the day. I assume we don’t have to go into the office. So I got a lead to follow up that gives more information on what’s going on.”

Gabriel was shaken from his thoughts at Blake’s words. “Wait, before we make plans to do anything, I need to know why you did it? Why did you take bribes from those victims, or should I say criminals?""

Blake’s body visibly deflated. He reached and grabbed the mug on the table, taking a sip from it. “My daughter was diagnosed with Leukemia. With hospital bills piling up, I didn’t want to ask anyone for help. I just wanted to give my baby girl the best treatment I could afford. When those men offered to hide some things, I did. I also made sure they weren’t doing anything else. So like with Mark, I had meetings with them weekly to make sure they weren’t and haven’t broken the lie. Besides Mark, the others reformed, working hard,” He explained, his Boston accent slipping out once again as his tone turned melancholy.

Gabriel just nodded his head in understanding. “Next time, ask me for help. I would’ve, even if we had a falling out over how you handle cases. Letting criminals go on the off chance they may do better isn’t up to us to decide.”

Blake just shook his head wistfully. “One of these days, you’ll understand not everything can be done by the book. The world isn’t a black and white thing, Rook.”

“Without laws and regulations, society will descend into chaos,” Gabriel argued.

Blake raised his eyebrow, his lips forming a cocky grin. “You literally went to a vampire-owned club, and probably fought the leader of them, Alucard. Do you honestly think the world itself isn’t already full of chaos, Rook?” he refuted.

Gabriel’s shoulders slumped in acknowledgement. “You’re right for once,” he mumbled loud enough for Blake to hear.

Blake just leaned back, finishing up the last of the coffee in the mug. “Cheer up, Rook. On the bright side, you’re not part of a secret world that most people have no privy to.”

“Lucky me,” Gabriel mocked, his face still bunched up in a look of defeat. “By the way, want to tell me why the captain was yelling at us on Monday?”

Blake leaned to set the empty mug on the coffee table. “His office was bugged. I can assume you had a meeting and you asked you to meet in another place,” he guessed, leaning back in the chair once again. “His office has been bugged for years. We just pretend to do work there at this point.”

“That makes sense, I suppose,” Gabriel drawled, his mind going towards wondering about anything else he has missed.

Blake stood up from the chair, stretching for a little bit. “By the way, my car is in the shop so I’m taking yours for the day if that’s okay.” Gabriel didn’t reply, just pointing to where the key bowl was by the front door. Blake walked past Gabriel and patted him on the shoulder before leaving. “Hey, by the way, why wasn’t I in the hospital?” Blake inquired, turning back from the front door.

“Oh, that’s simple, I learned how to heal people,” deadpanned Gabriel as he looked at Blake, his voice monotone.

Blake nodded before looking at Gabriel in shock. “Wait what?”

I’m working on a new platform called Moments, designed for people who want to enjoy small, meaningful, premium experiences — not full tours.

Examples:
	•	A sunset coffee in a private villa
	•	A pillion ride on a superbike like a BMW S1000RR
	•	A ride in a BMW M2 with its owner
	•	A curated private photoshoot setup where no one interrupts your frame
	•	Simple, short, emotional “moments” you can book anytime

It’s not a travel/tour booking platform.
It’s more like Airbnb Experiences, but for micro-moments and unique personal experiences that you normally can’t get anywhere.

I made a simple landing page to validate demand:
👉 https://bookmoments.carrd.co/

I’d love feedback on:
	1.	Does this concept make sense?
	2.	Would you or someone you know book these types of experiences?
	3.	Is the landing page clear enough?
	4.	Any features or categories I should add?
	5.	Is this something worth pursuing as a startup?

I’m a student building this on a budget so any feedback really helps.

Last month I’ve been taking not so good care of it probably bc of being too busy… watered it once a week or less but put in quite a lot of water; (it’s Winter here and my room temperature is stable around 19-20C) is this the problem?
I’ve also been using a magenta light lamp and the rubber trees like it a lot, but this one maybe doesn’t?

I’m not sure whether the problem is the lightning or watering.",2,1765434366.0,plantclinic,1,1.0,False

1pjqgl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1pjqgl5/life_after_5_10_years_after_cat/,Life after 5 & 10 years after CAT,"Hey folks, recently I saw a bunch of posts regarding call predictions, interview tips and so on. Those took me back to my days and I recalled the anxiety, excitement and the overall emotional rollercoaster I went through during that time and after. So, I thought I'd try to paint a picture of how the next 5-10 years post CAT look like. But again, these are from my experiences and the environment I was in. Not all would have the same thoughts and experiences, but this might give you some directional idea. I'm not sure what's the takeaway for you, but please try to take the positives only.

Brief about myself: 
BTech + MBA (top 10) --> E-commerce + Tech (FAANG)
7 years of post MBA experience (not 10 yet, but not much changes after one point) 

Breaking it down into 5 sections: 
1. Pre MBA
Time from now to the first day in Bschool
2. During MBA
3. Post MBA (till 3 years) 
4. Post MBA (3-6 years) 
5. Post MBA (6-10 years)

As you can imagine this is gonna be a long post and frankly I'm keeping it raw, hence you might find the flow a little unstructured.

Ok, let's start then. Grab a cup of coffee, and imagine we're in a coffee chat.

Pre MBA:
Excitement level: 8
Anxiety level: 7

1. You'd be playing a game of darts in the next few weeks/months. Some would hit, some won't. In some you'd feel you nailed it but end up with a waitlist impossible to convert. Be ready for it, since you won't control 100% of the outcomes from this point forward in life.
2. Stay curious in general. A lot of information dump is coming your way in the next 2-3 years. A lot. Join some interview prep workshop if you want, it'd help digesting the information in a slightly structured manner. 
3. Don't quit your job just yet. You don't want the anxiety levels to shoot.
4. Ask yourself ""why MBA"", not for the interviews, but genuinely to yourself. Most of you would probably hear back utter nonsense and that's okay coz you don't know much yet. But even if a small fraction of you get an answer, that'd define your next 3 years.

MBA:
Excitement level: 9
Anxiety level: 9

1. First 6 months would feel like you haven't experienced before. I've seen people cry, go silent & disconnected. You'd be sleeping 8 hours on a very good day. 
2. Your summer internship prep would begin the day you enter the institute. Managing lecturer, assignments, resume, interview prep, case studies, committite selections, parties, would feel tiring. It'd become a cocktail, some of you would get the high and enjoy and some would lose energy after first few shots and hope the party to end soon. 
3. Remember when I said that you don't control 100% of the outcomes anymore in life? Your summers would tattoo this into your memory. You might not make it to shortlists, you might fail to clear even a single interview out of 10 shortlists on Day 0. You'd see a lot of folks around you breaking at this point. Be kind. 
4. After summers life would be better, much better. 
5. If you get the PPO, life's good, if not, you'd be okay. You'd be a battle tested soldier by now and would fare much better in finals than you did in Summers. 
6. Couple of personal suggestions: decide what you want from your MBA. DO NOT FALL INTO PEER PRESSURE. Join a committee only if it excites you, not coz it's aspirational. Nothing would come as free lunch. Also, make 2-3 great friends for life. Stand by them, help them, cry and laugh with them. That's the only thing which would stay after 5 years.

Post MBA (1-3 years) 
Excitement level: 10
Anxiety: 6

1. You've done it. Your first MBA job. Money is coming and going into Tax and EMIs but heck let's party. And you should party. Date as much as you can and find a partner to settle with. Upto you really, don't do this and marry someone you barely know, or date someone and marry someone who's a friend now and have been with you through some shit. 
2. If campus placements weren't kind to you, jump ship within 1-2 year and don't work a profile you're not enjoying just cuz the money is good or you're comfortable. Do it as soon as possible even if it means pay cut.
3. Remind yourself ""My career is a marathon and not a sprint"". 
4. From day 1, prepare for your next role. That could be a company change, promotion or anything. Have a goal.
5. Be your own manager. Don't take your problems to your manager, go to him/her with solutions. Believe me he/she's tired. 
6. Develop the saving habit, even if small amounts. But do party as well.

Post MBA (4-6 years) 
Excitement level: 7
Anxiety: 5

1. You're most probably married or about to. You're a grown man/woman.
2. Expectations start to increase from work and society. 
3. You've paid off your education loans, and now saving for life choices, house, car or financial independence. Take this seriously.
4. Your career would start to get shaped and compounding starts. It'd be difficult to change roles after this point, not impossible but may come at a cost. You'd also start understanding your personality and interests better. 

I'd share the post MBA (6-10 years) depending if this was useful, coz that'd come with certain assumptions since I'm also only at 7 years so far.",67,1765434036.0,CATpreparation,14,0.98,False
