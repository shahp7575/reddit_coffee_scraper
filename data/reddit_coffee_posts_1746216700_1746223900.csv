1kdd3lh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdd3lh,Nearly finished restoration and veneer “sanded off”,"So, I’m retired and have done 1 or 2 pieces; just picked up a nice Lift Top coffee table. I finished the bottom, drawers, columns (finished, Stained, poly coats) and was working on final sanding of top section. I saw what looked like a little dark spot and before I figured it out it seems there is a very thin veneer. I posted pics of the finished bottom and then of the unfinished top and the “boo boo”. 

Is there anything I can do? I thing I’ll need to live with this but figured it could not hurt to ask.  I plan on staining tomorrow and will see just how bad it looks after stain. Any help, etc. is appreciated.

Buuuuut
At the start of the relationship sex was regular and was always up for changing it around, now I do think I’m on the higher side of the libido scale but nothing crazy and not different from most guys my age (I’m assuming) but for the past year I’ve pretty much always been the one to initiate, and what went from maybe 2-3x a week is now 2-3x every 2months if I’m lucky. Which I don’t even mind that much, I completely understand you have to be in the mood for it and it’s not really something you can control but she point blank refuses to do any position other than missionary and not for lack of me asking to swap or even do doggy for a bit but no it’s missionary or nothing.

I just don’t know how to go about expressing the kind of frustration that comes with the it’s only when you want, how you want without sounding like a complete dick. Part of me is thinking I should just also refuse when she refuses to do anything other than just lie there but I’m afraid that’s just me being petty and I’m not trying to be  rude or pressure her into anything she doesn’t want to but I feel like the key to a happy and healthy relationship is a good sex life and right now we are very happy but I just think it’s a slippy slope, so I would rather voice my thoughts now rather than way down the line.

It’s hard to explain but I feel like i give and show my affection a lot, (again I’m not saying it should be tit for tat and I do not expect sexual favours in return for material things) but for example tonight, I’m currently out of the country for a family thing and she’s been studying for exams anyway so we really haven’t seen each other that much. She had an exam today and I had sent her over money to go get food and coffee afterwards, I also bought her a £200 piece of jewellery as a kind of celebration for when the exams are over, and we were on FaceTime tonight where she was very thankful but I could tell she was kind of dancing around something she wanted to ask, after some “what is it” “Mon just ask” I got it out her; 

We have a holiday coming up and neither of us have alot of money, and I am all for travelling and seeing things and staying in a reasonably cheap hotel, no need for 5 starts just a place to stay with a good location. This has caused quite a few arguments because she would rather stay in 5stars+spa kind of vibes, Anyway she wanted to change hotels and I was in a good mood and not wanting to argue so I just said, okay. I didn’t want to get into it and have to make a thing of it but it was clear I was just saying yes to please her. A bit later I suggested we sext or send some photos which was just completely shut down. Which in its self is fine.

I just feel like she doesn’t see how much of a deal it is to me, and anytime I kinda bring it up it always circles back to “no our sex life is fine” or “friend x hasn’t had sex w her bf in 2months”…..friend x relationship has been attempted to be broken off multiple times- they do not have a healthy relationship.

AITAH? Am I being a dick? This is my first proper relationship as is hers so I don’t know but I also don’t want to just hit out with well I do all this for you why can’t you do this for me because then it sounds like I’m only doing they things for sex which I’m not, it just stings a little after doing them and either getting shot down or being told I can only do it in one position ",2,1746223200.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Nothing crazy just lazy to write though there's always something to say
Whew it's tough being an academic GUN 😔 🔫  started an assignment way way late like week before due date, 4000 words lord have mercy, submitted a day later 😔😔😔😓
Eat shit I got 79% after a 5% deduction. Lmaoo wtf. So 84? Yup yup that's me 

Not an ideal setup but imagine me at full potential 🤨🤨🤨 I learnt as I went along too! Woohoo!!
We up. Up up up. Put someone face down in the mud and pull up 😏👍🏾

What else 

I realised that post-break up I feel way more attractive than I did during the relationship. I thought it was fleeting but it's been like 5 months lmao. It didn't start right away but I noticed the different feeling around February? 
Did I change something about myself? No
Get more compliments about my appearance? Oh god no
Dress differently? Nooo, I mean I have a couple of new jackets a dumbass graphic tees but that's my usual 
Lose weight? Barely, I wasn't trying I just don't snack as much, honestly I still look the same lmao 
What's different? Literally nothing bruh I just look in the mirror sometimes and I'm like ""wait...why am I so tea??!"" 
Even today I went out to vote in the morning, was lazy to dress up so I put in my work jeans, work boots stained with coffee or smth and a tank top and a light zip up jacket on top because I didn't want to wear a bra lmao but the girls are a bit too big to be just out unrestrained without drawing attention. ANYWAYS pont is I (reluctantly) went out, bought some stuff at the shops went to vote, bought some alcohol bc I voted ✌🏾 And then went to subway to get food and went home. During the relationship I didn't notice people looking at me and all that, now sometimes I do, probably because I stand out, not necessarily because I'm gorgeous or something but regardless I'm like ✨🧍🏾‍♀️✨ 

Y'know?? Then I got home and took off the jacket bc it was hot and I looked at myself in the mirror and I was like ""huh.. I look good"" my lord it was just a plain tank top and some jeans bro, I was like ""hmmm, yes ate, tea etc etc"" 

Ain't nobody complimented me on my visuals and I'm feeling better than ever. If anything I feel like people have been treating me a bit nicer, a lot nicer I think. Had one guy my age say he was really impressed at how polite and sweet I am compared to other places he goes, I was really surprised because that's just my usual y'know but even then, more surprising was that it was someone my age y'know? I felt invisible for such a long time. 

Another one is a regular, again around my age maybe a little older asked me my name one day and guessed where I was from etc, pretty interaction but I was kinda weary incase it was flirting. Anyways vibe felt alright but I forgot to ask his name too so I did the next week and he introduced himself (he didn't remember asking me my name lmaoo) anyways he goes on this small rant about how every time he comes in I'm just so cool and nice to everyone and I never seem to have a bad day and that it's like idk nice I guess? And that really touched me, like there was no flirty undertones or anything it was just him expressing how he perceived me I guess? 

I'm not trying to be different but maybe I'm more open lately? Less closed in because I'm not so self conscious? I think my previous relationship gave me self esteem issues by proximity, trying to uplift someone so much or constantly being the dumping ground for self hate kinda infected me ? My self image wasn't great at a baseline either but it got amplified significantly just through proximity and honestly oversexualisation. I'd get compliments that were wildly inappropriate, especially depending on the location/environment and I was constantly complimented by me ex to the point that it felt reflexive as opposed to genuine? 

Y'know like I'd be speaking and he would disengage then be like ""sorry you're just so beautiful, say that again"" that seriously frustrated me, or when he didn't know what to say I'd get a compliment but it was so overwhelming. It got to a point where the compliments didn't mean anything to me because i was constantly hearing it, same way people say please and thank you. 
It felt disingenuous.  Anyways I'm here now, no need for external validation, feeling better than ever. I thought I'd wait before bragging about my improved self image and I'm happy to report that it's a sustained thing 😸

Other update, there's this bitch who's music I've been listening to for a Couple of years on Spotify. I started listening to this Japanese rock band more presently recently and I was like damn vocals ate they're great. The vocalist is the same person 😭 I fell in love twice ig 😭 girl got me good.

I got so much good feedback from people and I wanted to share my experience for maybe some other first time moms worrying about the same thing I was.

Our first flight was from DSM to DCA. We were NOT in first class at all. Our tickets were way in the back of the plane just to have easier access to the bathroom if needed. However, the gate agent said she bumped me and my baby up to first class since the flight was close to empty and she wanted us to both be comfortable. She was an absolute doll, and such a sweetheart. I genuinely don’t think I’ll ever forget her for the most selfless gesture. That whole flight, my baby slept the whole time. She did great, I had so much leg room, I was comfortable. It was a wonder flight and getting through the airport was a breeze at DCA once I arrived. I grabbed a coffee at the Dunkin’, found my gate, fed my baby, and not long after that we were boarding to fly to BTV. On that flight, I thankfully had an empty seat next to me where my girl was able to sit and play with her toys. 

The flight back home, the airport was a breeze. TSA was so nice about the stroller, the baby, and the fact I had a lot to manage. A few people even stopped to offer help which was so nice. Once we boarded she slept the whole way to DCA. 
Once we got there, stopped and grabbed a coffee, walked around the airport a bit to get some steps in since our lay over was 3 hours. 
Once we boarded the plane to DSM, things got rough. The plane was 100% completely packed. I had to hold my baby the whole time who was not tired in the slightest. The seat next to us was taken and it was a crammed fit. However, we had the most generous flight attendant who was IN LOVE with my daughter. She would stop and say hi every time she walked by, she’d play peek a boo with her. Once my daughter was getting super fussy and antsy, the flight attendant even asked if she could carry my daughter with her just to give my arms a break from holding her (So if the flight attendant from DCA to DSM on 4/27 is reading this, I love you and appreciate you so much) 

I feel like I’m just rambling on at this point. I just wanted to say thank you to everybody who gave me such wonderful advice on my last post in this subReddit and it truly wasn’t a bad experience at all. I was so nervous but all the flights and airport experiences were a breeze. To any mom who’s flying solo for the first time, you seriously got this. ",10,1746222578.0,americanairlines,1,1.0,False

I wasted several months just unsure how or where to start. It wasn’t until the end of summer that I finally landed my first fall internship.

**Step 1: Figure Out What You Actually Want**  
If you're not interested in something, you probably won't be able to commit to it long-term, at least, I couldn’t. So I experimented. I applied to several different roles that were loosely related to my major and joined school-based projects that gave me some hands-on experience (the barriers were lower than internships, but still useful). After trying business analyst and business intelligence analyst, I finally landed my first internship as a financial data analyst .

**Step 2: Resume, Searching, Interview prep**  
Resume: Once you have any school projects, present them clearly in your resume using the STAR format, and quantify your impact wherever possible. I used ChatGPT to help me tailor each version of my resume to the job descriptions  
Searching: I initially searched on Indeed and LinkedIn, but found limited options for internships. So I switched to Handshake, where I got my first internship there, and several of my classmates did too.  
Interview prep: I used AMA Interview to predict likely questions based on job roles and my resume, and asked ChatGPT for example answers, but I rewrote and personalized every single one. I also read through Glassdoor after-interview reviews from past candidates. For general prep, I created an answer bank for phone screens and behavioral questions. For specific roles, I expanded on this outline with more targeted content. After building my own cheatsheet of interview stories, I started enjoying the interview process. The key was to practice over and over, not just writing it, but speaking it out loud until it became natural.

**Step 3: Move Toward Your Ideal Role with Targeted Projects**  
Through my own job search, and countless coffee chats with seniors and hiring managers, this advice stood out: your major or school title doesn’t matter as much as your relevant experience does, unless you're applying to companies that strictly recruit from target schools. Even if you graduate from Wharton with a finance major, it doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a data scientist role if you have no related projects. That’s why my first internship and my full-time job were both unrelated to my undergraduate major. I built my knowledge base through school projects tied to the industry I wanted to enter. I also identified online courses (like those on Coursera, Udemy) that matched job requirements, and treated them like my own unofficial minor

If you’re just starting out, don’t feel discouraged if you’re lost. everyone was too. But once you have got the right system in place, defining your direction, building relevant experience, and preparing with intention, everything starts to click.",5,1746222434.0,internships,1,1.0,False

🚨 **Why I Started Using MITOLYN**

At 42, I felt older than I should.

\- I was tired all the time.

\- My focus was fading.

\- My joints ached.

\- I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.

\- And worst of all, I was starting to **lose my confidence.**

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted **real answers** and **a real solution**.

That’s when I discovered **MITOLYN** – a supplement designed to **restore mitochondrial health** (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

⚡ **What is MITOLYN?**

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.

Key benefits they promise:

**✅**Boost energy naturally

**✅**Improve focus and brain performance

**✅**Support healthy weight management

**✅**Reduce joint pain and inflammation

**✅**Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.

**🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)**

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

**✅CoQ10** – Supports cellular energy and heart health

**✅PQQ** – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria

**✅Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Improves mental clarity and memory

**✅Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress

**✅Resveratrol** – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties

**✅Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12** – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.

**✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Expverience: What Changed?**

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:

**✅ Week 1:**

Slight increase in morning energy

\- Clearer mental focus during work

\- No crash in the afternoon like before

**✅ Week 2:**

\- Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed

\- Digestion felt smoother

\- Less brain fog

\- I started to feel “lighter”

**✅ Week 3:**

\- My energy levels felt stable and strong all day

\- I could focus better at work for longer periods

\- My workouts improved — less joint pain

\- I noticed a mood boost too — more optimistic

**✅ Week 4:**

\- I felt like I got my younger self back

\- I stopped reaching for coffee

\- My weight dropped by 3 pounds

\- I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier

**💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN**

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:

\- ⚡ **Energy:** I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.

\- **🧠 Focus:** Mental clarity and attention improved big time.

\- **🔥 Metabolism:** My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.

\- 💪 **Recovery**: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.

\- 🦴 **Joint Relief**: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.

\- ✨ **Overall Mood**: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

**😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know**

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

1\*\*. Not Instant\*\*

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.

**2. Premium Price**

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.

**3. Limited Stock**

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.

**💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?**

Absolutely, yes.

If you’re:

\- Feeling constantly tired

\- Struggling with brain fog or poor memory

\- Battling joint pain

\- Gaining unwanted weight

\-  Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”

**Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.**

Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.

🔐 Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

**MITOLYN is not a gimmick.**

It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.

I noticed that the data based dialing is much easier without a preinfusion. 
because with a pre infusion of 15-20 seconds, the total time of 25-30 seconds (from pressing the button to the last drop) seems very short because you only have about 5-15 seconds from the first drop. if you now say that it is too under-extracted and should grind finer, the pre infusion time increases over 15-20, which is already too high for my dark beans anyway. but if i grind coarser to achieve a pre-infusion time of 7 seconds, for example, the grind is set coarser than for an extraction without pre-infusion. then the pre-infusion no longer makes sense because it serves to prevent channeling on the one hand and to enable a finer grind and thus a higher extraction on the other.  
as you can see, the subject of pre infusion is a bit more complicated than i thought, but everyone still advises using it. i found it much easier to achieve a reasonable value without pre infusion, whereas with pre infusion i didn't even find a reference point. the bdb also has a preset pre infusion of 7 seconds. so i could use this setting without waiting for the first drop as is usually done with the pre infusion. then i could simply aim for the 30 sec total time with this 7 sec (not 37 sec but 30 sec). or i could continue to omit the pre infusion and aim for the 30 sec.

I switched to inspire a couple years ago. 
Since then ive had nothing but trouble. 
Shortly after a family member passed away i went to inspire health as i required counseling. 

My doctor seemed like he cared. He sent me a few practices and offered me some alternatives to antidepressants. 
When i went to the counseling service he reccomends. It was religious. And they expect $120 a session in which id be counciled by one of their chosen lambs. Whether they have actual qualifications is undefined. 

I rung the second number and it was a religious based phone counseling service. Which charged $90 for a 1hr phone consultation. 

I talked to winz and they informed me that they would need serious justification to fund a $90 service.
I bought this up to one of the providers and they said theyd give me 10 free sessions and i calmly explained that 10 sessions wouldnt be enough and that i wouldnt be able to afford the following sessions. 
They then told me to talk to wins and get them to pay half. Making it $45 for a counseling session. 

I go back to my doctor and mentioned ""hey I notice that these people you have referred to me have no qualifications and are religious."" 

He says, ""I see....... do you believe in a higher power?"" 

I say excuse me. He says, 
""Do you believe in a higher power? Ive known people in your position where God places an obstacle in their path to test their will. 
God knows you are strong *my name*
Hes giving you this test, so you become stronger.

*hands me a paper to his religious courses* 

You have a gift that you could share with others in your situation. This is a course that will have you in the field working with people like you. I believe you can help people. 

I say. ""With all due respect, I know nothing about how to deal with grief. A depressed person isnt an expert on depression. I need help. Not a job. This could set up a situation where i feed people in my postion the wrong information. Because im no expert. Thank you for this. But i need help."" 

This doctor also misdiagnosed me with an autoimmune disease. And gave me potent steroids. I discussed this with my neighbour who has arthritis and he said you are on the same dose as me. This medication caused a lot of damage to my health. I started having heart palpitations and when i stopped taking them. Extreme imflammation which made my pain worse. 

I switched doctors within the same practice who was also my late mums doctor. My new doctor asked why i felt the need to switch. Which I think is a rude question as its obvious you two are talking behind the scenes. 

I said. ""His reccomendations put me in a negative state of mind. His idea of help is not the same as mine. following the death of a family member he was taking advantage of me. Not trying to heal me but further his own personal agenda."" 

She said. ""Well we try not to judge people at this clinic."" 

I said ""i have no problems with people who love religion. I have problems when it gets in the way of their abilities as a healthcare provider. 
'Pray away the pain' is something id expect from a medieval plague doctor. Not a doctor of modern medicine."" 

The problems didn't end here my new doctor is just as dangerous. For starters she doesn't weigh me, take my temp. She has poor investigation skills which mostly involves Google. 
I have some sort of crohns or gerd disease which causes me to have severe near life ending stomach pain. I have no idea what is wrong with me as the doctors can't find a cause.
I also take 800mg ibprofen to cope with a dislocated shoulder. My doctor refuses to listen when I mention my injury. 
""Let's just focus on one thing at a time."" 

Its all gone tit's up as although I only take one pill a day I started getting gastritis from the pills. 

Which she attributed to me taking Zinc pills and taking them on an empty stomach. 
I said. 

""Your inferance has a lot of assumptions about my diet without any evidence to back up your claims, it is a lot easier for you to make assumptions instead of actually comducting an investigation."" 

She then hands me a paper on foodmaps and she claims that my issue is related to drinking coffee. 
And reccomends i drink green tea instead. Which has more caffiene in it.. which would irritate my stomach more... 

This has made me super anti my gp i just rely on google and weed to keep me healthy and pain free. I managed to go about 9 months without ibprofen or omeprazole. Thanks weed. ",2,1746221832.0,chch,3,0.75,False

However recently, people have started ordering Uber eats to get boba delivered to us, so this poor Uber driver pulls up to a restaurant and tried to deliver it. I feel like this is against the spirit of the rule, but I can't quite put my finger on why. I guess technically we allow it, but I don't want the Uber driver walking around our restaurant looking for someone, and I certainly I don't want my staff to have to deliver it for them.

I'll refer to my friend's father as Dad and my bio-father as Father. Father was an emotionally and mentally abusive and neglectful asshole. He's a narcissist and he treated me like Iw as the house maid. I had to do everything in that house. All the chores, most of the cooking, taking care of the dogs, getting him coffee, etc. I hated it. I felt like I couldn't do what I wanted. So, after I turned 18, I left and moved into Dad's house. Things seemed fine after that for the most part. About a year and a half ago (about half a year after I moved in) Dad started having a rat problem. My friend and I kept asking him to get it taken care of, but he never did, saying that it's my fault because my ""room was always messy"". It wasn't my fault. It was his fault and his roommates fault because he and his roommate left trash and food everywhere. I never left food around. Eventually, I got fed up and talked to my aunt about it. She said she's talk to my uncle, and the next day, they picked me up and I started living with them. I called Father yesterday because I wanted to get my birth certificate and my SSID from him because I need those to get a job and because I wanted to be adopted by my Aunt and Uncle. Once he found out I wanted to be adopted, he got mad at me saying that I was basically ""stabbing he and my mother in the back"" and that ""I'm too good for them"". That wasn't my thought process at all. I just didn't want to have anything to do with him because he treated me like shit my whole life. He then said to text him my new address and that he'd mail me the birth certificate and SSID, then hung up. He then called my Mother, hoping she'd be on his side, but she called me and told me that she wasn't on his side and that I'm an adult and can do what I want.

### Understanding Adaptogenic Mushrooms and Their Unique Qualities

Adaptogenic mushrooms are gaining attention for their potential to support the body's ability to manage stress and maintain balance. These mushrooms possess unique compounds that help regulate the body’s response to stressors, making them valuable in today's fast-paced world. Unlike ordinary supplements, adaptogens work by normalizing body functions and enhancing resistance to physical and mental challenges.

Popular adaptogenic mushrooms include reishi, lion’s mane, chaga, cordyceps, and turkey tail. Each offers distinctive benefits, from boosting immunity to enhancing brain function. Their natural properties have been used for centuries in traditional medicines, particularly within Asian cultures. Now, with increasing scientific interest, these fungi are stepping into the modern wellness spotlight.

### Powerful Health Benefits You Can Expect

Many people turn to adaptogenic mushrooms to tap into their impressive health benefits. These mushrooms contain polysaccharides, beta-glucans, and antioxidants, which contribute to overall well-being. Here are some key benefits that make adaptogenic mushrooms a rising star in health routines:

- **Improved Stress Response:** Adaptogens help lower cortisol levels, reducing feelings of anxiety and promoting a calm mind.
- **Boosted Immunity:** Compounds in mushrooms like chaga and turkey tail enhance immune function, helping the body fend off illnesses more effectively.
- **Enhanced Mental Clarity:** Lion’s mane is known for supporting cognitive health by stimulating nerve growth factor (NGF), which may improve memory and focus.
- **Increased Energy and Endurance:** Cordyceps can improve oxygen utilization and boost stamina, supporting physical performance and reducing fatigue.
- **Anti-Inflammatory Effects:** These mushrooms contain antioxidants that fight inflammation, a common root in many modern health problems.

How Adaptogenic Mushrooms Compare to Traditional Herbal Remedies in Supporting Health
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>In the evolving world of natural health solutions, adaptogenic mushrooms are gaining significant attention for their unique approach to wellness. These fungi have been treasured for centuries in traditional medicine, but their rising popularity invites a comparison to more commonly known herbal remedies. When exploring how adaptogenic mushrooms stack up against traditional herbs in supporting health, several key factors come into play—potency, versatility, bioactive compounds, and overall impact on the body's stress response.

### Understanding Adaptogenic Mushrooms

Adaptogenic mushrooms, such as reishi, chaga, lion’s mane, and cordyceps, help the body adapt to stressors both physical and mental. They are rich in bioactive compounds like beta-glucans, triterpenes, and polysaccharides, which contribute to their immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory, and cognition-enhancing properties. Unlike some herbs that target specific symptoms or conditions, these mushrooms work more holistically, promoting balance in multiple body systems simultaneously.

### Traditional Herbal Remedies: A Brief Overview

Traditional herbs like ginseng, ashwagandha, chamomile, and turmeric have long histories of use worldwide. Many of these herbs are also classified as adaptogens, which means they help regulate the body’s stress response, immunity, or inflammation. Their active ingredients—such as ginsenosides in ginseng or curcumin in turmeric—have been widely studied for targeted effects, including energy enhancement, calming effects, or joint health support.

### Comparing Mechanisms of Action

Both adaptogenic mushrooms and traditional herbal remedies influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which governs stress response. However, mushrooms often contain a broader range of bioactive compounds that provide multifunctional support:

- **Immune modulation:** Mushrooms like reishi offer potent immune-enhancing effects by increasing natural killer cell activity, which traditional herbs may not influence as strongly.
- **Antioxidant support:** Chaga mushroom has some of the highest antioxidant levels known, outpacing many common herbal antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals effectively.
- **Neurological benefits:** Lion’s mane is known for its nerve growth factor stimulating abilities, aiding brain repair and cognitive function—which many traditional herbs do not target directly.
 
### Synergistic Potential and Versatility

One appealing aspect of adaptogenic mushrooms is their ability to be used alongside traditional herbal remedies to enhance overall wellness. While some herbs specialize in calming or energizing effects, mushrooms often provide adaptive energy and immune resilience without overstimulation. This balance makes them highly versatile for daily use in tinctures, powders, or teas, complementing rather than replacing traditional herbs.

### Safety and Side Effects

Both mushrooms and herbs are generally regarded as safe when used appropriately. However, the risk profiles may differ:

- Some traditional herbs can have stronger blood-thinning effects (e.g., ginkgo) or potential interactions with medications.
- Adaptogenic mushrooms are mostly well-tolerated but may cause mild digestive upset in sensitive individuals.
- Clinical data on long-term use of both groups still require more research, but historical usage suggests a favorable safety record.
 
### Supporting Overall Health and Wellness

When it comes to supporting health holistically, adaptogenic mushrooms offer a unique edge because they help restore homeostasis. This means instead of just treating symptoms, they support the body’s ability to self-regulate under various stresses, whether environmental, mental, or physical. Traditional herbal remedies often focus on specific health goals, such as reducing inflammation or boosting energy, which can be highly effective but more narrowly targeted.

### Adaptogenic Mushrooms into Daily Life

For people curious about natural wellness support, adaptogenic mushrooms provide a practical and innovative option. Their benefits can be experienced through daily consumption in various forms:

- **Powdered supplements:** Easily added to smoothies, coffee, or soups for a convenient boost.
- **Tinctures:** Concentrated extracts taken under the tongue or mixed into beverages enhance absorption.
- **Capsules:** For precise dosing without taste considerations.
 
These formats make it simple to combine mushroom supplements with traditional herbal remedies for a synergistic approach to wellness.

### Final Thoughts on Choosing Between Mushrooms and Herbs

If your goal is to promote wide-ranging health benefits and resilience to stress, adaptogenic mushrooms may offer something unique to add to your wellness toolkit. They don’t necessarily replace traditional herbal remedies but provide complementary benefits that target multiple systems in the body. Considering your personal health needs and consulting with a healthcare provider can help determine the best combination for your lifestyle.

Ultimately, both adaptogenic mushrooms and traditional herbs have valuable roles in natural health. As science continues to explore their benefits, these remarkable natural resources are likely to shape the future of holistic wellness, offering you more options to feel balanced, energized, and supported every day.

</div>### Conclusion

Adaptogenic mushrooms are steadily carving out a significant place in modern wellness, thanks to their unique ability to help the body manage stress and maintain balance. As more people seek natural ways to support their health, these mushrooms are gaining recognition for their potent benefits. Unlike traditional herbal remedies, which have been used for centuries primarily to treat symptoms and specific conditions, adaptogenic mushrooms work by strengthening the body’s overall resilience. This makes them a valuable addition to any wellness routine, enhancing energy, immune function, and mental clarity in a holistic way.

I'm in my late 20s, and I recently ended a friendship that had started out really meaningful but took a pretty hurtful turn. Now I’m second-guessing myself — did I overreact, or was it the right call?

This friend (I'll call him Charles) and I met through my university’s library. We clicked quickly, and over time, I opened up to him about some heavy personal stuff — childhood trauma, family conflict, and my mental health, including some dark thoughts I’d had in the past. I genuinely believed he was someone I could trust.

Eventually, he invited me to his church group. I didn’t mind at first, but the tone gradually shifted — especially when political talk started dominating things. I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable getting into politics, but Charles and his brother kept pushing, mostly with pro-Trump stuff. It got personal when Charles questioned if my values were just ""inherited from my dad"" — even after I told him I didn’t want to talk about it. He wouldn't let it go.

I finally told him his behavior was upsetting and that I felt I was owed an apology. Instead of texting back reasonably, he insisted on meeting in person — but not before announcing that our friendship was “already over.” I showed up anyway and even got him coffee, hoping we could talk like adults. But instead of owning up to anything, he said I had low self-esteem, accused me of dragging him down to my level, and at one point told me I was “talking like the devil.” He even tried to initiate a prayer I wasn’t comfortable with. I left feeling humiliated and decided that was it — I cut ties.

Since then, I’ve distanced myself not only from him but also from his church group and mutual connections. I thought I’d feel relief, but instead, I feel unsettled. His brother removed me on LinkedIn out of the blue, and Charles acts overly casual when we run into each other — like nothing happened, just giving fist bumps and acting upbeat. Some mutual friends have reached out to me, but I haven’t really engaged — just said I was busy.

Now I can’t shake the feeling that he might be telling others the things I confided in him — the deeply personal stuff — maybe even spinning it to make me look unstable or bitter. I feel like I’ve lost control over my own story, and it’s been eating at me.

Today, I saw him sitting two seats in front of me at the library (his back was facing me). When. got up to go for a drink, he quickly grabbed his stuff and moved 4 rows down and sat facing towards me. what's that all about ? How do you even process that kind of betrayal without exploding?

AITA ?

He took a trip to Finland a few years back that really impacted him a lot and has talked about how much he loved his time there, and one of the things he talked about in particular was pulla and how he misses going to a coffee shop and having a pulla and some black coffee. So I've been planning on baking some for him.

Today I did a test run of baking some pulla, and I'm worried they haven't come out right. They are definitely a bit dry because I overbaked them, but the filling seems to have melted out quite a bit.

My problem is that I don't really have a frame of reference, and I don't want to ask my partner because I want it to be a surprise. Does pulla usually have more filling, is it more like a sweet dessert treat? Or generally more like a lightly sweet bread roll, which feels more like what I ended up with?

(Fuck that test’s C/P and P/S.)

We often compare the MCAT to a marathon because it requires prolonged focus and mental exertion. Just like marathon runners can have their race day performance fucked up by poor focus on nutrition before and during the race, our MCAT performance, too, can be compromised without sufficient focus and planning. Since beginning to follow this sub, I’ve seen a lot of confusion surrounding how to navigate food on test day. Given that there are several ways nutrition can affect your test day performance, I wanted to write this guide to help others out who weren’t as fortunate as I have been in getting my nutrition education.

# Why does nutrition matter for test day performance?

When I was in high school and went to take the ACT, my mom woke up early and made me a breakfast she thought would consist of “superfoods for the brain”: a bowl of oatmeal with a fruit salad. Although that’s certainly a healthy breakfast by any standard, it had an unfortunate consequence of making me feel super hungry halfway through the exam, and this undoubtedly affected my performance. (No shame on my mom for trying.)

You see, nutrition has both short-term and long-term consequences for our bodies. Most people are aware that a diet filled with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish is generally helpful for lowering risk for long-term health problems. But the *short-term* consequences of nutrition are less readily understood by people. Have you ever eaten something that left you feeling tired and sluggish afterward? Or did the food you ate make you feel some kind of sugar crash 30-60 minutes after you ate it? Or did the food you ate just not sit well with you for the rest of the day?

The main issue with my mother’s breakfast she prepared for me was that it wasn’t appropriate for optimizing performance on the ACT. With that in mind, I’m going to break down some general principles that should help everyone navigate food and nutrition on test day.

# General principles

For any test day, you want to focus on fueling the body so it optimizes test day performance without causing problems in any way. With that said, here are my general guidelines:

* **Eat foods you normally eat and enjoy.** My mother’s breakfast I described above? I rarely had oatmeal and fruit for breakfast, so after eating it, it left me feeling a little off because I wasn’t psychologically satisfied. Additionally, I wasn’t prepared for how hungry it would leave me, since the majority of a bowl of oatmeal and fruit is *water content* that doesn’t provide energy in any way. First and foremost—even before the principles I’ll explain below—make sure you’re eating foods you’re familiar with and actually enjoy. The psychological impact of having a delicious lunch prepared for your break can help you, and the opposite can frustrate you.
* **Focus on a good balance of whole-grains, protein, and fat.** Carbohydrates will help your cognition and memory function without impairment. People who adhere to a low-carb diet pattern often have demonstrated difficulty focusing and thinking, and you don’t want this issue on test day. Whole grains also contain a lot more fiber content, and fiber and fat content of meals helps distend your stomach and delay gastric emptying thereby promoting a feeling of sustained fullness. Protein content of meals doesn’t necessarily do more than other foods for promoting *fullness at  a mealtime*, but it does promote *satiety,* which is the *length of time you feel full for after a given meal*. Liquid protein sources—i.e. protein drinks—are fine, but solid foods delay gastric emptying and promote satisfying gastric distension much more than liquids, thereby promoting prolonged fullness, so consider opting for meats, eggs, beans, nuts, and peanut butter over a mere protein drink.
* **Focus less on diet quality.** My mother was trying to give me *healthy foods*. Although oatmeal and fruit were great options—and check one of the boxes I mentioned above—my breakfast was lacking in the balance with protein and fat content. You see, fruits and vegetables are important for long-term diet quality helping with reducing risk of chronic diseases, but they don’t give you much in the short-term from a test performance aspect since they’re not known for caloric density or satiation. I wouldn’t stress about having a “healthy” breakfast so much as focusing on finding a breakfast that appropriately sustains you without causing you to feel sluggish or tired after you eat it. Again: what would a marathon runner prepare for their breakfast? Probably not 300 kcals of oatmeal and fruit.
* **Consume caffeine as soon as you wake up rather than right before the exam.** Caffeine is known for stimulating motility of your GI tract and acting as a diuretic causing you to need to pee. If you drink your coffee 20 minutes before you walk in for the exam, you might be caught halfway through the first section needing to take a shit or feeling like your bladder is about to explode. Avoid this by drinking your coffee or tea or energy drinks as soon as you wake up.
* **Food safety is important.** Don’t eat expired foods, foods left out overnight, or anything ”risky” before the test day. Don’t eat at restaurants whose food safety might be questionable the dinner before your exam. And when packing your lunch for test day, make sure you either have everything be safe at room temperature or else that you have an ice pack in your lunch box. The reason for all of this is obvious: you don’t want the food you eat to make you sick on test day or make you super gassy with indigestion. Be smart.
*  **Stay hydrated during the exam.** Some people forget to bring water and sit for the exam somewhat thirsty, while other people drink *too much* water to the point that they struggle with needing to use the bathroom in the middle of one of the sections. Try to drink between 12-16 fl oz during each section to strike a good balance with all of this. That should have you using the restroom at each break in the exam, but it won’t compromise your performance.

# An sample overview of test day meals

Let’s break this down into concrete ideas for food you can eat at each of the various time points for test day starting with the food you eat the night before.

*The night before*

**Goal: don’t fuck up your stomach tomorrow.**

* Avoid risky foods or restaurants with poor reputation for food safety. Avoid spicy foods that will induce burning diarrhea. Avoid foods you generally know you only *kind of* tolerate. Avoid foods that will make you wake up in the middle of the night (like super salty foods, which might cause you to wake up because you’re so damn thirsty). Overall, just be cognizant of and intentional about the food you eat here and avoid potential problems.

*Test Day Breakfast*

**Goal: Fuel your brain until lunch time without feeling sluggish or crashing.**

* Eat foods that are familiar to you – know how they’ll affect you, and know how they’ll fuel you. Everyone is different, so do what works for you.
* Strike a good balance of whole grains, protein, and fat
   * Whole grain waffles/pancakes with butter and syrup, scrambled eggs
   * Whole grain cereal (Cheerios, Frosted Mini Wheats) with Greek yogurt and a banana with peanut butter
   * Peanut butter toast or avocado toast on whole grain breads with a side of baked beans.
   * Oatmeal with raisins and walnuts in it, toast with butter and jam, and cheesy scrambled eggs.
   * Apple and peanut butter with a yogurt parfait including blueberries and plenty of granola and two hard-boiled eggs.

*Lunch and Snacks During the Test*

**Goal: Continue to fuel your body through the rest of the test by focusing on portable, shelf-stable foods that are enjoyable and will make test day a little better.**

* Build a lunch by combining any of these foods:
   * PB&J on a soft whole grain bread
   * Dry cereal – Frosted Mini Wheats (6 g fiber per serving)
   * Trail mix or mixed nuts or peanut M&Ms
   * Bananas, apples, oranges, or pears
   * Processed meats like Genoa salami or Sopressa (the *processed* aspect will actually help them be safe at room temperature for a while)
   * Cheese balls or cheese sticks
   * Small bags of popcorn
   * Packs of tuna or chicken that can be opened and eaten without refrigeration
   * If you want yogurt or something, have an ice pack in your lunch bag to help.
* Having a variety of foods helps with enjoyment.
* Hydration — don’t forget to drink water at each opportunity on test day. You should aim to go to the bathroom at each break. Try to drink about 12-16 fl oz with each break.

# Summary

None of this is stressful. Fuel your body; have a plan; make food your friend on test day. If you do, you’ll likely avoid common pitfalls that mess with your performance, and you may even score a couple more points because you had better focus and concentration.

Enjoy your food,

I've been talking to a girl I met in a bar about a month ago. We have seen each other again 2-3 times in said bar and we have been writing a bit. When we met she passed me a note that said "" when I talk to you it feels like time is stopping"" and some other complements, after I read it I passed her a note where my number was written on it. She wrote me on the next day. Another time after being in the bar I walked her to her place. While walking to her place she told me she's not ready to be in a relationship because of the responsibility it takes. I understand the part of "" I don't wanna be in a relationship"" but I don't understand what she means with the taking responsibility part. 

My biggest problem is that I don't understand the way she acts as well. She says she doesn't want a relationship but keeps talking to me or inviting me to places.I asked her out for coffee and she said yes to that. So tomorrow I am gonna meet her for coffee. 

My question now is that I don't know if I should keep trying to talk to her because of the (in my opinion mixed signals) 
Are those type of mixes signals normal ? 
 Little disclaimer: I don't just want a normal friendship with her. 

If there are any more questions regarding my situations I am glad to answer them.

He’s complimented how hard I train multiple times which I feel like could be taken a multitude of ways, but last night he complimented me on the way I look for the first time… Only I feel like I totally responded in a ridiculous way 🤦

So here’s my question.

I’m not always great at accepting compliments so I just wanted you to know I appreciated it and just seeing where things go from there 🤷 a friend of mine suggested that I say that and then say how about I make it up to you over a cup of coffee 🤷 I’ve definitely let him have his distance because I have made the invitation and it didn’t go anywhere… And I’ve just kind of moved on but after last night, I’m wondering if he is thinking hey… Her divorce is a little further back now and maybe I’m going to take her up on this offer… But I feel like I really shut him down 🤦

I thought perhaps it is just because they focus so much on clean washed coffees and don’t have the semi-gimmicky coffees seen at other roasters. After trying very unique washed coffees from other roasters (like the Fabio Nelson washed chiroso from Apollon’s Gold) I’m beginning to think it isn’t just a washed coffee thing, but something about how they roast.

I really like the profile so I’m going to keep supporting them, but was just curious if others have had a similar feeling. I may be the odd one out here.

I recorded a [video of how I brew coffee](https://youtu.be/6620BJw7DPg). Go me.

Why? Over the past few weeks, I've seen [Aramse's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxmrSgwW25g) about pour techniques pop up a bunch (rightfully so — it’s one of the best coffee-related videos I've ever seen), and then yesterday there was this post, [Looking for advice to level up my practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kcgjyn/looking_for_advice_to_level_up_my_practice/).

I watched OP's routine like 10 times. I had so many thoughts while reading it, I figured i'd just make a video instead of typing a wall of text.

It’s filmed from directly above the dripper — so you can’t really see the height of the pour, but you can clearly see the flow rate, how fast the contact point moves, the agitation in the middle, and most importantly — where i’m pouring.

A lot of new-to-this hobby tend to pour onto the walls, trying to wash down stuck coffee particles, miss large areas of the bed, or move around randomly with inconsistent flow rate. I tried to make a video that clearly shows how to control the stream and where to aim.

It’s my first (okay, second, here's [the first one](https://youtu.be/oy5mYvBdMIY)) brewing video. Production is lo-fi, but I still think it’s worth sharing.

We’ve been to New Orleans a bunch of times and usually stick to mid-range hotels. Just sharing a few that stood out (or didn’t).

Here’s where we’ve stayed before: 

**Drury Inn & Suites**  
Probably our favorite overall. Rooftop pool gets sun all day. Breakfast and evening snacks/appetizers are included — same with drinks (not amazing cocktails, but fun to grab a beer before heading out). Comfortable stay, good location, great value.

**Maison St. Charles**  
We had a suite with two rooms and a balcony — really enjoyed it. The place has some motel vibes but felt safe and relaxed. No coffee makers in the room, but great coffee in the lobby. Small pool, great hot tub. Breakfast was way better than expected — honestly beat out the fancy brunch we tried. Staff let us hang out in the hot tub after 10pm. This might be a fav.

**Hampton Inn Carondelet**  
Leaning toward the pricier side but totally worth it. Friendly staff, free breakfast (they’ll pack it to-go for early mornings), and a cocktail hour once a week. Two blocks from the Quarter, one block from Five Brothers (late-night fried chicken, snacks, and whatever else).

**Club Wyndham Avenue Plaza**  
Got a timeshare unit for $75/night a few years back. Room was bigger than standard, There was a shelter-in-place warning due to hurricane winds while we were there, and the staff hosted a free happy hour with snacks and drinks — very appreciated. Igor’s bar is nearby, and it’s right on the streetcar line.

**Hyatt Convention Center**  
Room was spacious — two beds split by a divider. Super comfy. Buffet breakfast was excellent. The area was dull though — nothing much happening outside the hotel.

**Holiday Inn Superdome**  
Felt slightly off-track at first, but we always saw folks walking back from the Quarter. Pool was solid, room was fine, price was good. It became routine to stop at Five Brothers on the way back every night.

**Sheraton & Marriott on Canal**  
They’re fine. Comfortable enough but overpriced. We’ve had better stays elsewhere for less.

**Thoughts on SpringHill Suites?**  
We’re staying there next — any insights? Just looking for real opinions: Was it a decent stay?

1kdbm4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1kdbm4d/why_is_there_so_much_discrepancy_regarding_names/,Why is there so much discrepancy regarding names for iced drinks?,"I guess I should preface this by saying I am not a barista however I am an espresso lover, specifically an oat cappuccino/flat white lover.

Depending on the shop, this drink can vary of course by volume/makeup however for the most part, all of the shops I frequent use a traditional 2:1 ratio resulting in a traditional sized drink which is really the only coffee/espresso drink I enjoy. 

Where it gets weird is how to order this drink iced when it’s hot out. 

Many places don’t ever list this “in between” drink as an option for iced, it’s either iced Cortado or iced latte, neither of which I enjoy, one lasts about 2 minutes due to size and the other completely overpowers any semblance of tasting notes the espresso may have had. Some places I go to will do an “iced cappuccino” or “iced flat white” which really just means anywhere from 6.5-8oz of drink with the aforementioned ratio and heavy ice which is what I want. The problem is many places that say I’m not a regular at or are more commercialized will say “sorry we can’t do that, we can only do a 12oz iced latte with less milk” so then I effectively end up getting charged for whatever a latte costs which is usually $1.00 or $2.00 more for the same amount of drink as what I asked for which was apparently “not possible” because of the lack of option in their POS. 

Any input on this? It’s frustrating because logically what I’m asking for makes sense and there are plenty of shops that have “iced cappuccino” or “iced flat white” on their menu.

1kdblae,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1kdblae/bandon_dunes_report_425/,Bandon Dunes Report 4/25,"Just got back from my first trip to Bandon with seven friends. Thought I'd give the TLDR report, especially for people who have never been or are on the fence. 

  
First thing, right off, the bat, a bit about me / friends: I am from Ohio, lived in LA for 20 years. Played Pebble, Spyglass, Pasa a few years ago. I've played Torrey, Bethpage, Tobacco Road, LACC (N & S), all of the Coachella Valley courses. I'm a 10 index. So are my friends. I'm 43, married, one kid. 

Bandon Dunes is *by far* the best golf trip I've ever been on and the best buddies trip I've been on. Given the choice of playing any of the courses at BD or Pebble / Spyglass, I'd almost always choose the Bandon course. First a bit about the courses: We did: 

Sunday: Preserve / Trails

Monday: Shorty's / Old Mac

Tuesday: Sheep Ranch / Bandon Dunes 

Wednesday AM: Pacific Dunes

Thursday AM: Bandon Dunes

My favorite was Bandon. My least favorite was Sheep. The other three are all very close, but I think I'd go: Old Mac / Trails / Pacific. 

As for the courses: 

Preserve is the best Par 3 I've ever played and nothing comes remotely close. The Hay is genuine dogshit next to preserve. It is challenging, unique, beautiful, and emotional. Seeing 16 / 17 at BD from the higher points is amazing. Also, getting to know the land / turf / greens / traps / etc. before the big courses was a must. I love it. 

Trails: A phenomenal, fun, interesting, challenging course that, like Spyglass, takes you through multiple experiences and makes you feel different things. The only problem with this one was that the greens were recently aerated. This made putting not fun. Even though we knew about this, and even though they weren't nearly as bad as LA courses post-aeration, it took away from the experience. Hard to properly rate it although the walk was brilliant. My favorite aspect of this course is the walk between holes into the woods / meadows / dunes. You feel like you're hiking and then hitting balls. Spectacular. 

 Shorty's: Not ready yet. It was fun. We enjoyed it. But it's not Preserve and it's not grown in, and I think, given the choice between Shorty's and Preserve Part 2, I'd take Preserve again. It might be better in a few years. 

Old Mac: What a course. From the moment you tee off, you feel something special as that Ghost Tree looms in the distance on 1. When you hit that third tee, and hit that most famous shot on property you're already vibrating, but cresting the ridge on 3 and seeing all of the course beneath you, hearing the ocean, and taking in Bandon Dunes from this spot was my favorite moment on the entire trip. It's hard to put into words that feeling of hitting that ridge and feeling that rush. #3 on Old Mac is my number 1 hole on property. The rest of the course is awesome. It's huge and exhilarating and never not interesting. I had read that those middle holes lose steam for people, but they didn't for me. This course felt the biggest and grandest of them. After playing Bandon a second time on Thursday, we all agreed that if we had one more round, we would have played Old Mac again. 

Sheep Ranch: A really really great morning course. Getting there early, hitting their range, having their breakfast burrito, and teeing off on that first hole in the marine layer was a special moment. The rest of the course was really fun, but given the grandeur of the other courses, this one did leave something to be desired. I don't think it's necessarily the land itself, its just that the other courses have these dramatic elevation changes, breathtaking topography, and super interesting routing that Sheep Ranch didn't have for it's own reasons. I loved it. The tee shot on 6 was incredible. 9 was one of the best holes there. 14 was killer. I eagled 18. If this was the only course we played all week, I would rank it towards the top of my all-time list, but with this group, it's number 5. 

Bandon Dunes: The best course I've ever played. My whole group agreed. It is interesting and engaging from the first hole. You are always looking around at something new and cool and thought provoking. It's challenging, but also playable. It's the truest ""Links"" golf on the property and, having never been to Scotland / Ireland, made me feel the most. My favorite moments are the tee shot on 3, the reveal on 4, all of 5, the approach on 7, the 13th, the green on 14, and then 16 / 17 / 18 are absolutely, batshit crazy incredible. The routing, the land, the dunes, the creativity, the way it forces you to think like you've never thought on a golf course, the views, the sounds, the wind. All of it was the best experience I've ever had on a golf course. And I got to do it twice. My second round, in which I shot 82, was my favorite round of golf of my life. And I missed multiple short birdie putts. 

Pacific Dunes: This course, might be, objectively, the best course there, but, because it was the last one we played, because it was so ridiculously windy, and maybe because it was a bit overstimulating, a bit was lost on me. When I look back at individual holes (3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18) I can't believe how perfect it was, but in the moment, I felt a bit overwhelmed. It was, not coincidentally, the worst score I've made in a decade; and I want to play it again. I get everything Doak was doing, that mound on 13 is amazing. It's beautiful. It just kind of hit me a bit too hard and overstimulated me. I think, if I went back tomorrow, I'd want to play again, to give it a second shot. 

Ok, the other stuff: 

The most surprising thing about BD, as a whole is the food. Everything we had was awesome. I live in LA, one of the other guys lives in NYC, we all agreed it was the best resort food we ever had. Trail's End, Shorty's, Charlottes, and Sheep Ranch were all 10/10 golf course food. I don't even like steakhouses, and Ghost Tree was incredible. The chicken parms at the Lodge were awesome. Breakfast burrito, perfec.t But the real star was McKee's. I OWN A SPORTS BAR in LA, and McKee's is the best bar food I've ever had. We are all from NE Ohio and agreed they were the best wings we've ever had. The burger was great, the fish and chips was incredible. I had the steelhead twice. The pub fries. Oh my god the pub fries. We were there five nights and had McKee's three times. The whole group just kept talking about the food. 

We stayed in the Grove Cottages, and we were very happy there. The living area was far bigger than we expected and the rooms were super big. I also love having my own space as I get up at 5:45a every day to shower and read and having my own room meant I could be alone and not bother anyone. You are home far less than you think you will be, but when you're home, you're never cramped, always comfortable, and given perks like a coffee machine, wine fridge, theragun, and these giant blowup pants to massage your legs. It's where we'll stay next time. 

Also, the shuttles. Oh my god the shuttles. You pull up your phone, call a shuttle, and in 2 minutes you're on a bus; usually alone. On Wednesday, with a 9:40a tee time at Pacific, I called the shuttle at 8:15 to the Lodge, we were eating the breakfast buffet by 8:25. Called the shuttle at 9 to the range. I was hitting my first ball at 9:08. Called the shuttle from the range at 9:25, and I was checked in with my caddy by 9:35. Quicker than driving. 

There's other stuff that we loved; just little details that made the trip better: the hospitality everywhere was 10/10; the Shipsticks system is super dialed in, the Punchbowl is really fun; the practice facility is A+++, the protein balls are awesome, **they have Diet Coke & Diet Pepsi (DC for the regular people and DP for the insane people),** and other details that just make things happy, but two big things that I think are notable: 

1. It's just not that busy. The frustrations / difficulties of booking the place mean that there just aren't that many people on campus. This means the shuttles are empty and you're not going to multiple places. It means there's no wait, even for an eight top at McKee's at 7p, it means there's no backups at the first tee, no long lines at the pro shops or the halfway houses, and there's always a stall for you on the range. Compare this with Pebble and they're two different sports. 

2. speaking of Pebble, it's absolutely impossible to not notice the lack of pretense all over the property. No huge buildings, no statues, no gilding, no chandeliers, no spa, no tennis courts, no expensive retail, no valet, nothing that makes you feel like you're at a resort. It's not that we weren't spending money, but we always felt it about the Golf. It was the anti-Trump. And this means that you never feel weird wearing your golf clothes to dinner, you don't feel bizarre hanging out with your friends outside the lodge or talking trash on the shuttle after a round, you feel comfortable with your caddy, at ease in the lobbies, and you play freer and without worry. The few of us that had been to Pebble noticed it on Day  1 and even before we played Old Mac or Bandon or Pacific, we wanted to come back. We all travel and stay in nice hotels and enjoy hospitality. This was better. In every way shape our form. 

As far as tips I would share; most of the stuff is already on this page or Youtube, but I would say that you must get caddies; not just to read the greens, but almost every shot is an optical illusion. You are rarely hitting where you think you are supposed to be hitting. They judge the wind, know where your miss is, know where the linksy creative off-the-hill play is, and of course, read the insane greens for you. 

Also, play as early as you can. The wind is very real and after, say 11a, the rounds become circus rounds. 

Eat protein balls. 

Eat at every place on property. 

You have time to go to the practice facility. I know you think you don't, but you do. Just go hit balls. 

Go with your friends. Save your money. Just go. It is the best experience you will ever have. 

And finally, things I think they can improve on (these are not nitpicks, they're opportunities): 

Put Rokus in the rooms. You don't need to do it in the bedrooms, but we wanted to cast Guardians games in the living room and couldn't. This is like a $5k investment. Just leave a Roku in the room. 

Also, get the baseball package at the bar. I know you're going to get a lot of requests, but OK. So? There were playoff basketball / hockey games on, we wanted to watch something else. Again, $1k investment. 

I think that's it. Best experience I've ever had. We'll be going back as much as we can.  ",10,1746219285.0,golf,2,0.92,False

I know I need to drink more water, but for some reason I can't make myself do it. If I didnt need to drink 3 mouthfuls with my morning pills, I might never drink water at all. The only other liquid I drink is 8oz of coffee in the morning.

I feel thirsty, I bring my water bottle with me everywhere, I like the taste of water... so why can't I make myself drink more? For some reason I lack the inherent motivation and survival instinct to drink water when I'm thirsty, even when it's readily available.

Does anyone have any tricks to help me drink more water? I've tried the following so far.

1. Adding water flavorings: I haven't found one I like. I think it's the citric acid that most of them have. I dont even like soda or juice. I prefer the flavor of plain water.

2. Tracking with apps: I haven't found one that I'm motivated to keep up with, but I would be open to trying your suggestions.

3. Setting a timer: It worked for a while, but now I just dismiss the alarm without drinking anything. It's too easy to ignore.

4. A water bottle with goal marks: This worked when I first got it last year, but now I just ignore the lines.

I have not heard anything. This all started in February when my account went against community standards. I have no idea how. The only thing remotely in line with that was a comment on a post in a ladies group I was in. The op said she was so tired, what's the answer xyz, c*Caine? Vitamins? So everyone commented in a joking way including me. I said I told my coworker I needed some in my coffee. That is all. Now why in the fuck is that against a rule? One lady said c*Caine is definitely the answer. When I briefly had a new account I rejoined the group and that post was still up, as well as the other comments. So I'm not sure if that was my problem. We were all joking, not that ai can tell the difference.  And it's not like we were offering to sell it 🙄. I've never done anything even close to that.

So I'm looking at the Control vs the Rhake.  At this point I don't see myself using a backpack both as luggage (clothes etc) and laptop/EDC/tech puch.  So that's why despite the seemingly rave reviews on the Control the Rhake seems like a better fit.  For example, upcoming trip the hotel is like 20 min from HQ.  Then activities/team stuff is 20 min Uber from that.  I don't want to pack everything (clothes) for a trip into the same backpack that I'll just need to take laptop/tech stuff to/from HQ.  Does that make sense?

Anyway, appreciate your thoughts and let me know if I'm missing anything.  I'm in a buy once/cry once on a backpack and by all accounts these are great.

I need advice.,"So I have been married for my wife for three years now. She sponsored me to come i wit her in the USA. But since arriving here I found her to be very different. Before I came she was very understanding and kind. She always apologized when she did something wrong and was considerate of my feelings. she also very materialistic. She is alwyas lookign at social media and lookign at people traveling, having expensive purse. She dont ask me for it, but she waste so much of her money buying it for herself. She say she is too shy to ask me, but also will look at these items in front of me or bring up her frind and say wow look at the purse she has. i dont like this at all. 

she also always want to go out. she works full time, and on the weekend she wants to get coffee at coffee shop. she ask my permission, and if I say no she begin cry and tell me I restrict her. i dont understand why she need to get coffee from outside when she can make it at home.. I tell her that her working is her going outside. and she does not need to go outside mroe than that. 

Now I feel like I am always arguing with her and she never takes responsibility for her actions. Recently she left the house for two weeks to spend time with her family. I told her she could go but if she went we would not talk to each other during the time period because I want the space from her.

When she left she kept on messaging me that she misses me and she wishes I was with her. This made me angry because she is the one who chose to leave the house. At first I would respond to her messages but then I decided it was not worth it. She made her decision to go and I needed my space so why does she has to message each day?

I am the one who stayed behind to work provide and she is there having fun not thinking about my feeligns at all. She come back from her vacation unexpectedly in the middle of the night when I was sleeping. Once she entered I could not sleep anymore so I went to get fresh air.

She follows me and begins to berate me about why I didnt respond to her messages. I let her know that I did not have to because she was the one who chose to leave. She start crying her crocodile tears and calls a therapist. She starts telling the therapist that I am abusive, that i gaslight her, that I am mean to her.

She is the reason why I cannot advance in life here in america. She loves to keep pushing me when I am angry and all I ask for is space. Last time we got in an argument, her brother call me to tell me I should be grateful that my wife gave me greencard> I got so mad I rip my documents apart. I told my wife it her fault that I did that and now I have to get all the replacments for it. And she is not taking responsibility for her action on how she push me.

I also want to get a better payign job that will require for me to be gone fo rlong time, and she is not supportive of that. She keeps saying why is it that I want to be away from her, and ask me million times a day if I love her.

I use to love her but how she treats me now, I dont think I can love a women like this. I am thinking of divorving her. advice.",0,1746218582.0,MuslimMarriage,59,0.2,False
1kdbbji,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kdbbji/im_not_my_best_friends_best_friend_and_i_maybe/,I'm not my best friend's best friend and I maybe never was.,"I've made my first reddit account purely because I need to get this out.

I, 18 male, grew up pretty isolated and didn't have close friends for years. I was pretty quiet and when I did make friends I would normally find out that they were just using me or pity friending me. Because of this, I'm not good at identifying things within friendships and I don't know how to deal with situations like this.

At the end of my sophomore year of high school I met my friend, who I'll call Rome, 18 male. He was nice to me and seemed genuinely interested in me as a person. At the start of our Junior year I joined his friend group where everyone was kind and accepting. I want to make it clear that I love the people in my friend group and although I am hurt by the situation, I don't blame them.

After joining the friend group I met someone who I'll call Julian, 19 male. We became really fast friends and he admitted to me that he had also not really made close friends before. I felt like he understood me and with his help, along with Rome and the rest of the group, I grew in confidence and became more outgoing. By summer, me and Julian were talking about living together after high school and I considered him my best friend. I never told him though, I don't really know if that's something you're supposed to do. I was closer to Julian than I'd ever been to anyone.

Side note: I don't want to come off like I abandon Rome. Yes, he brought be to the friend group but we didn't click like I did with Julian. We don't leave him out and I still consider him one of my favorite people, and he knows this. He also has had a best friend since before we ever met and I think his bf is a very cool/kind guy. Rome is OKAY.

At the beginning of our senior year another guy joined the group. Nick, 18 male. Nick was EXTREMELY shy, more shy than I used to be. But Julian and I through he was really cool and started hanging out with him as trio sometimes and he also came out of his shell. Nick clearly always liked Julian better thought. When I found out they were hanging out one on one I didn't think too much of it. But by the spring semester I started to realize my dilemma. I would ask Julian to hang out and half the time he'd say ""sorry, I'm hanging with Nick."" or ""Nick and I were gonna get coffee, but you're welcome to tag along."" This was also around the time Rome started dating his girl friend. I felt like no one had time for me and was honestly really lonely. (still am.)

In the summer, me and Julian were working at the same place so I got to see him most days. Summer was actually pretty great as we would hang out after work at least three times a week. Yes, Nick was normally there but, after a six hour shift of goofing off with Julian it wasn't so bad. Also, I do still love Nick. I'm writing this out of frustration but Nick didn't actually do anything wrong and he's still fun to be around.

After summer, some of the friend group moved away due to college leaving only myself, Julian, Rome, and Nick in the same city.

Me and Rome started to notice that Julian and Nick were kinda turning into the same person. They dressed the same, they talked the same, they listened to the same music. We started joking that they would start dating. So yeahhh....they started dating. They told us A MONTH AFTER. They didn't tell us they were dating for a full month. They started telling everyone their ""perfect love story."" How they had been best friends basically since they first met, how they knew they were meant for each other. This sounds sappy because I'm writing while angry but they really are happy together and I genuinely think they'll get married some day.

At this point in writing this I don't know what my objective is. I just hate that everyone is choosing other people above me. I hate that no one has seemed to notice how this would hurt me. I've talked to Rome a bit about it and he knows that I don't like that their best friends but other than that I've kept it to myself. I'm just so angry that I can't blame anyone but myself. I can't make people choose me.

And yes, I know the answer is probably just to tell them how I feel. I just can't seem too. I know how guilty they would feel and don't want everyone to feel as bad as me. I'm just heartbroken and angry and theres nothing I can do about it.

I don't know where I went wrong. I think I'm an enjoyable person to be around. I think I'm a good friend.

literally any advise would help. I'm clearly doing something wrong when it comes to friendships. I've had failed friendships before but I could always blame them(seriously, one of them was a shit person)

For some, they might be an older sibling that excelled in sports, or maybe a grandpa that served in the Army; for me, it's my Uncle David. He grew up where I still live today, a mining town in Montana called Pine Mountain, and even worked the same ranch with his folks as I do with mine. Unlike a lot of other ranchers around here, though, Uncle David had plans besides raising cattle for the rest of his life.

Pretty much from birth, Uncle David was racing and wrenching on old cars. His first one was a 1965 Ford Mustang fastback, painted Bullitt green and built to race around on mountain roads, which I actually bought from him when I turned sixteen years old. His real pride and joy, though, is his 1969 Chevy Camaro SS, which he built into a full-on racecar for the road, back in the early '80s. (He does still have the car, and he drives it regularly.) He's got a million stories about his escapades behind the wheel, but recently, he's told me a few that I'd never heard him talk about before. 

See, Uncle David grew up here in Montana, but when he married Aunt Paisley, he moved to Thunderville, Tennessee, just a stone's throw south of Knoxville, to run moonshine for his new in-laws. With his driving skills and souped-up car, he was the perfect fit for their family business, and he brought three of his hometown buddies (plus their cars) in on it with him. The four of them took on jobs at my great-uncle's repair shop in Thunderville, and once in a while, each one of them would load up his car (or truck, in one case) with a few crates of 'shine and take them where they needed to go. Most runs were about what you'd expect, with the weirdest thing they saw being an unexpected deputy sheriff or revenue agent hiding in an especially shadowy ditch, but some of them were just... different. Uncle David told me one such story last June as we sat on his front porch, sipping iced tea with a splash of blackberry corn liquor, under a clear Appalachian night sky.

""It sure is a nice night,"" I remember saying.

""Yep,"" he replied, his voice carrying an odd combination of the local Tennessee accent, mixed with remnants of his western Montana one. ""I spent a lot of nights just like this one running liquor for your aunt's folks. Lots of memories in that car,"" he continued, motioning towards the beautiful Daytona Yellow machine parked in front of his small farmhouse.

I have to take a moment to describe his Camaro, because I've wanted it for as long as I can remember, and I can't keep myself from nerding out about it. Like I already mentioned, it's painted Daytona Yellow, but the hood, spoiler, and front lip are all flat black. It sits low to the ground on big, wide racing tires, and all four fenders have huge flares to cover the extra tire width. The spoiler is an old NASCAR-style one, basically just a piece of metal bolted to the trunk that sticks up at an angle, and it has a pair of big fog lights bolted to the front bumper that really sell the old-school road racer look. Combine that with a high-revving, small-block V8 engine, a four-speed manual transmission, and exhaust pipes that poke out beneath the doors, and you've got the perfect small, nimble moonshine runner, which doubles as a stupidly fast racecar. It was exactly this car that my uncle was talking about as he launched into one of his many tall tales, and already, I was hooked.

""Did you ever see anything weird while you were making a run?"" I asked him. Suddenly, his gaze became distant as he seemed to think about my question, and he took a long gulp of his moonshine-infused sweet tea as he turned to me.

""That depends, what kind of 'weird' do you mean?"" he asked.

""Well, there's a lot of dumb stories floating around, about spooky stuff happening in the Appalachians, but I've heard some of it is… sort of true, at least,"" I replied expectantly. He slowly nodded as he scratched his short, scruffy gray beard, and eventually, he seemed to come up with something.

""All right, I've got something weird for you,"" he told me. ""It was September of ‘83, right after Paisley and I got married, and I was scheduled to make a run one Friday night. As it turned out, I was delivering that corn whiskey to a wolf-man.""

David Anderson glanced at the calendar in the shop's back office as his shift at Jeffers's Auto Body neared its end. It had been a very, very long day, and based on the words ""David, delivery"" written on that day's date, it wasn't going to be over for another several hours. He sighed as he downed the last of the coffee in his metal thermos and glanced at the decorative, Coors Banquet-branded mirror on the wall across from him. His wavy hair and short beard, both a mild shade of brown, were an absolute mess, and his blue-green eyes shone through the patches of oil and grime on his face like gemstones. He sighed as he stood up to his full height, just over six feet tall with a bulky, muscular frame, and stretched as he prepared to punch out for the day. Just as he was about to leave his tiny desk, though, one of his fellow mechanics poked his head into the room.

""Hey, Dave, you headed out?"" the other young man asked. He was shorter and more wiry than David, with darker brown hair and similarly brown eyes, and a white Stetson cowboy hat sat like a crown atop his head, a stark contrast against the stained, torn-up overalls that the young men both wore. 

""In a second, yeah. What's up, Bobby?"" David asked him. Bobby Carson was his oldest, closest friend, one of the three that had joined him in Thunderville to run moonshine with Paisley's family. Bobby was the most businesslike of the bunch, with the best head for numbers and the charm of an old Wild West movie hero, the perfect combination to wheel and deal with potential buyers.

""Oh, nothing. Callum just wanted to know if you're coming to the bar,"" Bobby replied.

""Nah, it's my turn to make a run tonight. This one's way out of town, too,"" David said with a shrug.

""Ah, right. Well, you'll be missing out on the ten-cent beers,"" Bobby told him, as if to entice him into putting off the delivery.

""Sorry, Bobby. Maybe next time,"" David stated firmly.

""All right, all right. Tell us all about it tomorrow,"" Bobby joked as he turned to leave.

""Sure. Oh, and Bobby?"" David began, causing Bobby to briefly turn back and look at him. ""At least let Mariah finish her shift at the bar, before you whisk her away again?""

""Hardy-har. See you later, Dave,"" Bobby concluded with a rueful smirk and a shake of his head as he walked out of the office. David chuckled to himself as he straightened the papers on his desk and walked out himself, punching the garage’s time clock as he strolled to the gravel lot behind the shop. Parked there was his custom-built Chevy Camaro, its bright yellow paint and dusty chrome trim shining in the early evening sun. David hopped into the driver’s seat and put the key in the ignition, twisting it and bringing the car with a mechanical roar from its souped-up engine. He put the car into first gear and feathered the gas pedal as he pulled onto the town's short main street, ready for whatever lay ahead of him that night.
___
David gnawed idly on the toothpick in his mouth as he and his Camaro cruised down the mountain road, his right hand lazily gripping the steering wheel as his left hung out of the rolled-down window. It was a peaceful, cloudless night, and although he couldn't hear them over the rumble of the Camaro's engine and the drone of its tires against the asphalt, he knew that a million crickets were singing their beautiful song all around him. If he didn't have a delivery to make, he might've still passed up on going to the bar with his friends, instead opting to sit on his front porch and relax with his wife. At the very least, it was a decent night for a drive, and he certainly wouldn't turn down a chance to push his car to its limits.

David shoved the gas pedal down and sent the car rocketing forward, the force of the acceleration shoving him backwards in his seat as he gripped the steering wheel with both hands. The small-block engine under the Camaro's hood howled into the night as the car blasted down the mountain highway, straight towards a sharp left-hand turn. David narrowed his eyes in concentration as he worked the gas, brake, and clutch pedals all at once, rapidly downshifting and slowing down the car before sending it through the sharp curve, still at high speed. The Camaro's tires didn't even squeak as it sliced through the corner, and David could feel the rear spoiler holding the car stable as he hugged the center line, carrying a ridiculous amount of speed out of the turn and hitting the gas once again.

Adrenaline pumped through David's veins as he held the steering wheel and shifter in a white-knuckled death grip, his eyes and mind focused solely on the road ahead of him. Immediately after the left-hand turn was another sharp curve that took him back to the right, and David sent the Camaro blasting through it with the same speed and precision as before, the flared fenders of his car nearly kissing the guardrail as he slammed the shifter up a gear and took off down the following straightaway. Just ahead of him, the road descended downwards into the deep, dark woods of Wade's Hollow, a deep, narrow valley miles from Thunderville, on the other side of the Tennessee-North Carolina border. He flipped a switch on the car's dash, just below its CB radio setup, activating his car's fog lights and lighting up the road ahead like it was midday as he descended into the dark, wooded valley. That was when he spotted something that made him slam on his brakes, and caused his blood to run cold.

For the briefest moment, David thought that he saw a silhouette of a man standing on the road, but there were several things that made this conclusion impossible. For one, the “man” standing before him was huge, no less than eight feet in height and built like Conan the Barbarian. Secondly, and much more obviously, its body was covered in dark gray fur, with no clothing besides the tattered remains of a pair of brown pants on its legs, but that still wasn't what caught David's attention the most. The thing's face and head weren't human in the slightest, instead closely resembling that of a gigantic gray wolf. Its eyes reflected the intense glow of the Camaro's lights back at David,  and although that prevented him from truly seeing them, David could feel the boring into his very soul, sizing him up. The two remained frozen there, staring at each other for what felt like an eternity, until the wolf-man bounded into the woods, leaving David sitting alone once again, utterly stunned.

David reached for the handset of his CB radio, and for the first time, he noticed that his whole body was trembling with fear, and his heart was pounding in his throat like a drummer at a rock concert. He did his best to steady his hand as he clicked the button to speak, tapping into the radio channel used by him, his wife, and his friends to communicate while one or more of them were driving.

“Yellowjacket to Fireball, come in, Fireball?” David said into the radio. As his left hand gripped the handset much tighter than necessary, David's right hand drifted to the stockless, sawn-off shotgun stowed behind the Camaro's passenger seat. Between the cases of illegal alcohol in his trunk and the equally illegal firearm sitting in his cab, David presented an extremely desirable target for a passing revenue agent, if one happened to drive by. However, seeing as the road was empty in both directions, he was willing to take the chance.

“Fireball to Yellowjacket, I read you. Are you all right, David?” Paisley, David's wife, responded over the radio.

“Uh… have you ever seen anything… weird, out this way? I'm a few miles across the state line, in Wade's Hollow,” David told her.

“Not that comes to mind, why?” Paisley asked. David hesitated for a moment, wondering if he should tell her what he'd seen, until he decided against it.

“No reason,” he finally replied. “I'm almost to the drop-off. I'll be home soon.”

“Okay… be careful, you hear?” Paisley admonished him.

“Will do, Paisley. Yellowjacket over and out,” David concluded as he put the handset back. He took one more moment to steady himself, suddenly very unsure about this delivery. He forced himself to calm down and put the car in gear, making up his mind that he'd drop off the moonshine and get home as quickly as he could.

Before long, David found his way to the small, run-down cabin where he'd been asked to bring his load of corn whiskey. Very slowly, he pulled up to the dilapidated wooden building, his headlights pointed straight at its front door, and brought his car to a stop. A feeling of unease came over him as he got out of the car, and acting on instinct, he patted the front-left part of his waistband, where he'd tucked a Colt 1911 earlier that evening, although he hadn't expected to actually need it. His boots crunched in the loose gravel that covered the cabin's tiny front yard as he took a step towards the house, trying to figure out whether or not anyone was home.

“Hello?” David called out, but there was no response, even after he'd waited for a few moments. “I've got the delivery… ten cases, just like you wanted, he continued, but there was still no response from the cabin. Finally, David gave up and turned around, intending to head to his trunk and unload the liquor he’d brought. However, at that moment, he learned that he wasn't alone.

David jumped, and his hand shot to the gun in his waistband as he spotted the form of an haggard-looking man trudging out of the woods behind his car, a deer carcass slung over his shoulders. He wore an old, tattered flannel shirt and brown trousers, and although his feet were bare, he walked across the coarse gravel without so much as a flinch. David took a deep breath to steady his nerves once again, before turning to the man who'd suddenly appeared.

“Jumpy, ain't ya?” the old man asked, his raspy voice carrying a thick southern accent.

“It's been an interesting night,” David replied. “I'm assuming the delivery's for you?”

“Yessir. Just put it on the porch,” the man instructed him, pointing to the small porch attached to the front of the cabin. David glanced over his shoulder at it as the man dropped the freshly-killed deer on the ground, near the edge of the woods to his right. The porch appeared to be in just as poor shape, if not worse, than the rest of the cabin, but David wasn't going to question it. This entire situation gave him the creeps, after seeing… whatever it was on the road, and he was more and more ready to be home with each passing moment. Working as quickly as he could, David unloaded the ten wooden crates from his trunk, each one holding six Mason jars of top-quality corn whiskey, setting them on the porch in two neat rows. Once he was done, he wiped his brow and turned to the man, who held out an envelope that David could tell was full of cash.

“Here ya go, son. Tell Ol’ Man Jeffers I said hello,” the man instructed him as David accepted the envelope.

“Sure. Should I attach a name to that message, or…?” David inquired, earning a chuckle from the old man.

“Oh, he'll know. Drive safe now,” the man replied before turning and walking towards his house. David, meanwhile, got back into his Camaro and started it up, gunning the engine as he prepared to leave. However, he looked up at the cabin one last time, and he saw the man watching him from the porch, a jar of moonshine held lazily in his hand. David's eyes widened in shock as he realized that the old man’s eyes were reflecting the light of his headlights, exactly like the wolf-man's had. David could almost feel his veins turning to ice as the man shot him a knowing grin, before taking a swig of the clear brew and winking at him. David gulped and quickly put the car in reverse, deciding that he'd best be getting home. He'd had enough adventure for one night, and he was ready to sleep.

“A werewolf? Really?” I asked Uncle David incredulously. He smirked and downed what remained of his drink, sucking in a small breath through his teeth as he set the now-empty glass down.

“Yep, and he sure wasn't the only odd thing over in Wade's Hollow. The folks there always paid well, when we made runs down that way, but they were all just a little… off,” he replied.

“Off how?” I pressed him further.

“What, a man who can turn himself into a wolf monster isn't ‘off’ enough for you?” he retorted with a laugh.

“No, I mean… there were more weird things down there?” I replied.

“Oh, plenty, but we don't have that kind of time tonight,” he told me as he stood up. “Best you get some sleep, all right? Will's big race is tomorrow, so we have a long day ahead of us,” he concluded as he headed into the house. I agreed that I certainly should sleep, but my mind was racing far too much to actually do it. My uncle, the only man I looked up to as much as my own father, had not just one, but multiple supernatural stories that he'd never told me? I had to get to the bottom of this, and that day, I promised myself that I would.

Beneath oak trees, here, beneath oak trees

- Dylan Gossett: Beneath Oak Trees

Ciao! My name is Meruyert. 
*Ghost hugs! You can’t feel it, but it’s there.*

I plan on starting my studies in Italy this autumn. Well, you can’t blame me for trying to find a like-minded person in Italy, since I wasn’t successful in my home country, can you?

I’m 24. Asian. Height is 156 cm. Weight is around 50 kg. Brown eyes, black hair. Oopsie, default colour is black, but I dye it often. I used to have 5 piercings, but they all healed.

I smoke sometimes and I like my coffee cold and black. I guess I enjoy bitter flavours (you know what they say about people who like bitter things, 
hahaha (๑>؂•̀๑)).
I barely smoked 5 packs of cigarettes in my life though. Two of them were bought in Urumqi, during my last trip to China. I enjoyed fancy baby Chunghwa Slim and less fancy Furongwang Yellow Hard.

I started running just a while ago. My goal is to increase my endurance to start hiking and traveling by foot more in the future, so I will probably add strength training. I am also interested in boxing since my small stature is a good bait for low-abiding citizens.

About important things now:
- I am a feminist.
- I am an atheist raised in a conservative, Muslim household.
- I believe in science and evidence-based medicine.
- I support the LGBTQ+ movement.
- I care deeply about disabled people’s rights.
- I love all animals. I have a female cat called Luci (from Latin Lux).

Hobbies:
- Reading with annotations (I know some of you think ‘not enough words in there for ya, bud?’).
- Crafts: I learned how to sew kimono, make a stray cat shelter, change a kitchen countertop wrap.
- F1: A very recent one. Since the reader is likely an Italian, I’m gonna say I am a Ferrari fan (and it wouldn’t actually be a lie, because everybody is a Ferrari fan).

Divorce sucked and was expensive. Being solely physically and financially responsible for our kids is hard. Having to work full time and do all the maintenance, cleaning etc too is hard. 

But how damn good is it to not be gaslit when hoping for the barest of minimums?!!

This year, I signed up for a early morning run with a friend, with medals and coffee and a celebration. One of my kids offered to make lunch. And no one will make me feel bad about myself for the whole day.

We’ll be there three full days together ― a Wednesday afternoon to Sunday morning. We’re both first-timers, so hoping to do some big hits (but hopefully not pack the agenda so tight we forget to enjoy ourselves). Here’s our rough plan, anything big you think we’re missing or insane to attempt?

**Wednesday afternoon-evening:**

\-Check in to hotel in Marylebone area, wander the area and find a pub.

**Thursday:** We wanted to do some of the big spots on Thursday to hopefully avoid some weekend crowds.

\-**Morning:** Take the tube down to St. James Park to stroll and take in the sights at Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben. We don’t plan on going into any of these spots, just looking (unless you really recommend it!)

\-**Noon:** Walk up to Covent garden area for some lunch and a pint, then hit up the Camera Museum for a coffee pick-me-up and peek at cameras (bf loves cameras) before hitting the British Museum for probably 2 hours. 

\-**Evening:** 7 pm dinner near the museum at Cafe Deco

**Friday:** This is the day with the least amount of stuff so far ― super relaxed. We just knew we wanted to check out Notting Hill! Open to any suggestions.

\-**Morning:** Take the tube to Notting Hill and stop at Kuro for a coffee/pastry, then wander and admire the pretty houses, see the Portobello road market.

\-**Afternoon-Evening:** There are a few pubs/gastros that stood out to us in the search ― The Pelican, The Champion, Churchill Arms, Ladbroke Arms. We’ll probably hit up some of those and (depending on timing) get dinner at one. Shout out any other Notting Hill suggestions.

\-If there’s still sun in the sky we’ll walk around Hyde Park before we tube back to Marylebone (or maybe take the tube back a bit earlier and wander Soho).

**Saturday:** 

\-**Morning-Noon:** Take the tube to Borough Market, get a coffee/pastry. Then we’re walking Tower Bridge and going to London Tower.

\-**Afternoon:** After London Tower we’re going to wander our way up to Shoreditch, maybe going to Sky Garden for a drink and snack but definitely hitting Spitalfields Market.

\-**Evening:** We’ve got a reservation at Brat kind of early, 6:15, so will probably explore pubs around Shoreditch after dinner. Some places that stood out in the search: Knave of Clubs, Culpeper, Buxton. Shout out any other suggestions.

Grateful to hear your thoughts :)

I’m not ready for a long term relationship. And I don’t rly want to do the fwb thing. But I still want to go on dates and do fun couply things. Like cute sunset picnics, long late night drives to go stargazing, or even just brunch or dinner or weirdly aesthetic dive bar or diner dates. But more as really close friends rather than life partners if that makes sense? Or like summer fling without the expectation of physical intimacy? But still kinda flirty? Idk how to define it

Anywho I’m Frannie, pretty much this confused about everything since ‘02. I’m pretty introverted and shy but trying to not let myself be this depressingly lonely forever so here I am. 

Now that I’m thinking about it idk if I even have hobbies. Like does wandering around aimlessly downtown count? Cause tbh I love just going on mini day trips where I literally just spent half the time walking getting distracted by different things and the half sitting around in coffee shops, libraries and bookstores. Only issue is it gets expensive cause my impulse control when it comes to cute little handcrafted trinkets that I lose within a couple weeks, overpriced lattes and outrageously overpriced vintage clothes. 

I spend way too much of my life just watching movies and tv from my pretentious love of Bogart to bingeing (idk why but that word just doesn’t look right) the same sit com series for the millionth time in a row. Or 2000s rom com. And pretty much everything in between. But I’m not like a movie lover person who knows all the actress names and directors and behind the scenes lore cause who just has the brain space for all that. I can barely even remember half the movie titles I’ve watched and on occasion have started watching a ✨Film✨ then realize a few minutes into that I’ve already watched it and just skim through it to remind myself what happens. But lowkey I’m so jealous of those people who know everything about every movie. Like idc how big of an asshole Tarantino is, he could pull me with the yapping alone… I’m mostly kidding but think I lowkey kinda just awakened something in myself 

I’m also starting to get into cars because I’m REALLY HOPING to get some good news from a car dealership office admin job interview I did on Wednesday. I’m really starting to hate the work environment at my current job. I do business admin right now too but it’s for a small construction company. 

Physically I’m 5’4 and uh kinda generic skinny white girl with glasses tbh. I’m only really looking for someone around my own age, open to guys and gals 💜💙🩷. And um yeah idk tell me about yourself ",0,1746218291.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I didn’t get the hype either—until I spent a week fielding client calls on my personal number while vacationing in Mexico. Cue the spam texts, missed boundaries, and a very confused Uber driver. Now? I’ll never go back. Here’s why.

# Why Virtual Numbers Are a Freelancer’s Secret Weapon

As remote work explodes, so do the headaches:

* Clients texting at midnight because they have your real number.
* Platforms demanding US numbers to join (looking at you, Upwork).
* Geo-blocked tools that lock you out if you’re traveling.

Virtual numbers fix this by giving you a disposable, US-based line that *isn’t* tied to your SIM card, location, or sanity.

# How I Use Virtual Numbers to Keep My Work Life (Mostly) Sane

After two years of remote chaos, here’s where virtual numbers have saved me:

* Client boundaries: Give clients a work-specific number. When the project ends? Retire the number. No awkward “Why are you texting me on Sundays?” convos.
* Platform hopping: Need separate accounts for freelancing, side gigs, or testing? Virtual numbers let you dodge the “one account per number” rule.
* Travel flexibility: Worked from Portugal last summer. My US number still got 2FA codes for Slack and Gmail, no roaming fees.

**Works with**:

* Most freelance platforms (Upwork, Fiverr)
* Productivity apps (Trello, Notion)
* Payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe)

**Fails with**:

* Services that block VoIP (e.g., some banking apps)
* Platforms requiring “real” numbers for KYC (rare, but check first)

# The Real MVP? Reliability.

I’ve tried free services. Big mistake. One ghosted me mid-client call, leaving me scrambling to explain why my “US number” was suddenly a disconnected line. After that, I switched to Grizzly SMS. Their [virtual US phone number for SMS](https://grizzlysms.com/countries/usa?utm_source=reddit) actually works—no delays, no flaky connections. I used it to verify a client’s project management tool last month, and the code arrived faster than my coffee.

# 3 Rules for Freelancers Using Virtual Numbers

1. Separate work and personal: Never mix client comms with your real number.
2. Rotate numbers annually: Fresh number = fewer spam cobwebs.
3. Pair with a VPN: Avoid geo-flags when working abroad.

If you’re ready to [get a virtual phone number USA](https://grizzlysms.com/countries/usa?utm_source=reddit) without the drama, Grizzly SMS lets you grab one in seconds. No contracts, no SIM swaps—just a clean way to keep work and life *slightly* more divided.

# The Bottom Line

Virtual numbers aren’t just about privacy—they’re about control. Control over your time, your clients, and your peace of mind. And in the gig economy, that’s priceless.",1,1746218225.0,GrizzlySMS,0,1.0,False
1kdb6kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalInactivity/comments/1kdb6kn/welcome_to_paranormal_inactivity/,Welcome to Paranormal Inactivity,"**Introduction:**

Welcome to the subreddit!

*Paranormal Inactivity* is a ghost-hunting idle/incremental game in development by yours truly.

In a world where ghosts run amok, you play as an aspiring ghost hunter whose father mysteriously disappears.  In your quest for answers, you discover that this world - full of unique ghouls and sinister spectres - hides even more secrets than you could possibly imagine.

You will make friends.  You will explore a reimagined world.  You will help those who cannot defend themselves.  You will learn, experiment, investigate, fight, and grow.

But will your aspirations and efforts be enough to uncover the truth?

Only time will tell.

----

**What type of Idle/Incremental Game is it?**

I have a lot of favorite games and genres.  Games that I have always returned to and have drawn inspiration from like

* *Luigi's Mansion*, *The Binding of Isaac*, *Phasmophobia*, *World of Warcraft*, *Diablo*, *Bioshock Infinite*, *Pokemon*, and *Don't Starve*.

The idle/incremental space is no exception to that.  I've played days and days of games like

* *NGU Idle*, *Melvor Idle*, *Clicker Heroes*, *Cookie Clicker*, *Antimatter Dimensions*, *Trimps*, *Magic Research 2*, and countless others.

So, to put it plainly, *Paranormal Inactivity* is the idle/incremental game that ***I want to play.*** It is my genuine attempt at combining my favorite aspects of the games I've played and enjoyed throughout my life.

----

**What's in the game?**

I'm currently implementing several of these features that I find essential to the game's integrity:

* Fully-drafted story with Multiple Routes
* Original Artwork and Concepts
* Multiple ways of progressing through the game
* Primarily Idle, but optionally Active gameplay
* Systems are parallel to and compliment (not override) each other
* Systems start simple, but grow in complexity and features over time
* Rewarding Achievement System
* Curated Experience and Leveling System
* Mobile Support (Browser for demo, Apps for full release)

WARNING: SPOILERS about Game Systems:

* >!Rarity-based loot system and item management!<
* >!Roguelike Haunted Houses!<
* >!Relationships that Strengthen the Player!<
* >!Ghost Collection Book!<
* >!Detective Puzzles and Evidence Hunting!<
* >!Turn-based Combat System!<
* >!Class Choices!<
* >!Prestige Mechanic fully woven into the Plot!<
* >!Prestige Rewards based on how you Completed each Run!<
* >!Easter Eggs!<
* >!A cat!<

----

**What's NOT in this game?**

* This is NOT a game you will finish in one sitting
* This is NOT a clicker game
* This is NOT your typical number incremental game with simple generators and exponential numbers.

----

**When is it coming out?  On what platforms?**

Right now, the demo is in development to be released on browser by late 2025.  Afterwards, I am planning for the full game to be released on Steam, with hopes that I will be able to release on iOS and Android shortly after, though mobile apps may admittedly take longer to fully release.

The demo will release on this webpage: [https://paranormal-inactivity.com/](https://paranormal-inactivity.com/)

----

**How much will it cost?  Are there any microtransactions?**

The demo will be free and I would like it to be its own complete and rewarding section/loop of the game.  I want to say that it will cover around 10-20% of the main game, which, in my mind, will amount to several days or even weeks of dedicated gameplay.

The full game will most likely cost around $5 and contain the rest of the game along with more cosmetic features such as themes, artwork, written works, etc.

There will be **no microtransactions in the game**, but additional content may be available on Patreon in the form of Art Exclusives, Dev Blogs, and Written Works as this will be a lore/story-driven game.

----

**How can I support this project?**

Join this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalInactivity/), join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2CgnUDwyNQ), join the [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Damiascus?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink), [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/damiascus), or wishlist on Steam (when it's listed).

1kdb5hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1kdb5hi/top_strategies_for_increasing_your_retirement/,Top Strategies for Increasing Your Retirement Savings in Your 40s and 50s,"**Ever felt like you’re running in place with your retirement savings?** It’s a common feeling, especially in your 40s and 50s when it seems like time is slipping through your fingers. But fear not! There are ways to turbocharge those savings without turning your life upside down. Let’s chat about some of the **top strategies** to fatten that nest egg. 

**1. Boost Your Contributions – You Got This!**  
You know those “set it and forget it” contributions? Time to give them a little love! If your employer offers a 401(k), sweeten the deal by upping your contribution. Even a 1% bump can make a big difference over time. Think of it like giving your retirement account a little protein shake!

**2. Side Hustlin’? Channel That Cash!**  
Got a talent for crafting, dog walking, or maybe you're a savvy online reseller? Use that side hustle income to pump more into your retirement savings. It’s like finding hidden money in your couch cushions but way more responsible. 

**3. Budgeting: The Not-So-Scary Beast**  
Budgeting might feel like a dirty word, but it’s actually your best friend. Take a close look at your monthly spending. Are you Netflix binging too often or hitting up those overpriced coffee shops? Ditch a few extras and funnel that savings straight into your retirement fund. Your future self will send you a thank-you note!

**4. Catch-Up Contributions – Yes, Please!**  
Did you know you can make “catch-up” contributions if you’re over 50? If you’re eligible, this means you can save an extra $7,500 in your 401(k) for 2023! That’s a solid boost when you need it most. It’s like getting an extra cookie while on a diet—totally justifiable!

**5. Invest in Yourself**  
We often forget that investing isn’t just about stocks and bonds. Consider taking a class or certification that could lead to a higher-paying job. Knowledge is power, and the right skill could unlock a whole new level of earning potential. Plus, who doesn’t love learning something new?

**6. Debt? Let’s Tackle It!**  
If you're juggling debt, it’s time to put on your superhero cape. Focus on tackling high-interest debt first (looking at you, credit cards!). Less debt means more room in your budget to save for retirement. You’ll feel lighter, both financially and mentally!

**7. Max Out Your Accounts**  
If you’re able, aim to max out your retirement accounts. You might gasp at the number, but think of it this way: every dollar you put in is a dollar that compounds and grows. It’s like planting a tree; with a little care, it’ll bear fruit in the future.

**8. Think Diversification**  
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket (or in this case, one retirement plan). Explore different types of accounts—Roth IRAs, traditional IRAs, and 401(k)s. Mix it up and let that money work for you in different ways. After all, variety is the spice of life!

Okay, so I’m feeling pumped! Retirement does not have to be a stressful topic. These strategies might feel small, but they can pack a mighty punch if done consistently. Whether you're further along in your savings journey or just starting to think about it in your 40s or 50s, remember: every step counts!

I love this community and just figured I can share.

I've been married to my husband for 9 years. I moved to his city after the wedding. And even though I have friends, they all live a bit far from me, ao we can't just go for coffe or a movie whenever we want. 

His best friend was his best man at our wedding. Maybe half an year after the wedding he met a girl and we would go on double dates with them. 

She was nice, had her life figured out. And I really wanted to have a friend closer to home. We started going out to the movies to watch romantic comedies, since the men don't watch movies like that and she had no one to go to them with. We would have lots of fun every time we would go. After a movie we would sit somewhere drink coffee or whatever and just chat. And even though we wouldn't go out all the time I thought I had made a friend.

They were together for 5 years, he proposed, she said yes, and then things went down the drain. They broke up. My husband was talking to his best friend making sure he was doing ok. And since I thought I had made a friend I checked on her. We decided to go out for a movie. After the movie she vented to me about her side of the story and I listened. After that day she started dodging me in messages and the ghosted me.

Some days after the break up my husband's best friend stopped talking to us. He didn't talk to us for 2 years. Tonight we finally got together with him and reconciled. After some alcohol was consumed he wanted to tell us why he stopped talking to us. We had always assumed he was mad at my husband for his opinions around the break up. (My husband has strong opinions, he is often unapologetic, and always says the things he thinks. He lacks tact.) It turns out, he was mad at me. Because this girl, that I thought was my friend went to pick up her things and told him that ""This so called friend of yours, took me out to the movies and then listed to what I had to say, just so she can gossip with her husband"".
So not only did I not make a friend, but she used my naivete to hurt him.

I think I might have a depression.

There is this person. We've known each other for 4 years. I never liked him before. But he started to make sexual comments about me, to me. And I kinda leaned into it.
He is much older than me.


I wait and wait until he calls me. And when he does, I analyze the conversation afterwards and focus what I said right or wrong. I always think I fuck up.

I do my best to look good. Customize myself all the time so I can hide how dark my mind is. Lip filler, fake tan, hair dye, hair rollers, fake nails, make up. I need to be desired by him, right.

Just for those few minutes when I feel admired. And we have sex. And he looks at me and I feel important. Then we shake hands cause he has to go.

 But he never hugs me. I don't remember  him hugging me. I told him few months ago that I catched feelings and he stopped holding my hand and hugging me as he doesnt want me romantically. I really crave his hug. 

I can't have it.

I pretend I'm not having emotions involved. And he is cold as ice. 

I feel empty inside. I don't have a sense of myself. I had codependency issues in the past and now its back again. 

If he called me now, and wanted to drive somewhere, I jump into my car just to be with him for a while. He never does. I want him to need me.

I am slowly going insane and as I write this I start crying. How pathetic I am. How I never learn, only repeat the same patterns. Sex with him makes me feel seen. Like I just went from bottom to the top of his list. But I know I didn't. And he jokes that my future husband will be happy with me. It's funny for him.

And I fantasize about my own death. But I don't really wanna die, you know? I just imagine his face drop. I imagine him sitting and rethinking everything. I imagine him crying and missing me. I shouldnt be saying this but I imagine myself lying dead and people finding me. But I don't wanna do it, you know? I have a dog that I love the most and my family. I kinda think about it but I know life is beautiful and I don't want it.

Everywhere I go, I feel like a carry a huge sense of sadness. Like this energy is felt by people. Like they can see through. Like its a big, black cloud above me. I feel bad for not enjoying the moment with my family. I think about him all the time. 
Then I drive home and cry my eyes out. Lately, I often do. 

I can't say it to him because he'll break everything as he doesnt want emotions involved. 


He was supposed to call me second time but he didn't. Its 10 pm. I wish I could do something but I don't even watch anything on my tv. 

I will see him im few days and we will have sex but we never go for lunch or coffee or we never drive around and we do nothing together.  

I wait for something that will never happen and it scares me. I am tired. I am sad and empty. And he wouldn't even care if I had a partner. Because it's only fwb as he said.

But friends care for each other. I don't even want him to love me. But to hug me sometimes. To treat me like a human...

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

About 1.5 years ago I met two girls with autism and was chatting with them about their experience of autism as a female and after these discussions it kind of flagged it to me that I hadn't really considered how different this can appear in females. I went down a totally obsessive rabbit hole (still going) and I feel quite convinced that this is me, although it always felt like it still wasn't the full picture. About half a year ago I went for 3 weeks holiday with a long time friend who I hadn't spent time with in that way before (more like chats over coffees and hobbies etc.), it turns out he had recently found out he has adhd and after 3 weeks of being together 100% of the time he was like I think you absolutely have adhd as well. I got home and added this to my rabbit hole, now realising again that the female presentation can be wildly different to the stereotypical one. Then I came across the concept of audhd shortly after and I have never felt like I identify with something so much. I have generally always been described by people that know me very well (including by myself) as a walking contradiction. For more context, I study physics and I have generally always been very high achieving and successful in an academic sense which was easy for undergrad which is very modular so I was very organised and was the top in my year all the time, but doing a phd I have been all over the place because it is unstructured and i get very understimulated and bored with it and then get told off for making careless mistakes all the time because I just can't pay attention to it if I don't find it interesting, plus I did almost all the work in the final few months working from waking to sleep and put everything else in my life to the side until it was done, also having like 10000 tabs open and flipping between writing random sections of random chapters because I get bored doing it chronologically, I am very sociable but in a very specific way in that I do have lots of friends but I have to have deep connections with them and generally do better/prefer 1 on 1 situations, and I will be happy and engaged then suddenly a switch flips and my face goes flat and I immediately need to leave because I'm done, I also don't do small talk and I generally exclusively bond with people over passion relating to shared interests, bringing me to another point, in the past year it has come to light that majority of my friends are also neurodivergent and almost all my female friends have adhd (I find that I get on well with friends that have autisautism but I always feel... fast? and this energy is matched with my friends who have adhd but I burn out faster than the latter), and i tend to bond really deeply and get very hyper when people do the same with me, otherwise I can be very reserved because I feel like I don't know what to say / have anything to say if im not interested in it or I know I can be a bit overwhelming or 'weird' with my passion about things. I do also have some very deep long term interests, but I also have shorter term more fleeting deep interests, both of which tend to be socially perceived as 'cool' such as DJing, techno, coffee, climbing, psychology, life drawing, travelling... Most of all, I have extreme sensory sensitivities so eg. I only work at home because I need the right temperature and access to unlimited teas and can move around/go for walks, and I need music to do literally anything like I listen to techno most of the time otherwise I just don't do things, plus I get distracted by noises easily. I burn out when surrounded by people I'm not comfortable with (most people). I struggle with what I realised was executive dysfunction, I only recently discovered that was not a universal trait. And also I have such extreme emotions about literally everything, I have always been described by everyone as extremely sensitive more than anyone anyone has ever met... 

The list goes on and there is lots of more nuanced stuff too. 

I guess my question is that only people really really close to me ever notice any of these things, most peoples impression of me is wildly different to the me that people really close to me get. So I don't know if I'm barking up the wrong tree or I mask very well or I have audhd and the two mask each other... and a diagnosis feels rather pointless since there is severely lacking understanding of audhd in females plus UK so would take years. I feel like treating myself as having audhd has actually helped too, like since implementing some thought processes relating to audhd, my generalised levels of anxiety have strongly dissipated. 

Any input / advice / validation (or not) is welcome.

I was one of them.","I won't go into detail why I was thrown out of my house at sixteen. Financial problems/I came from a poor family. 

Mom and Dad wanted me to get a job, and I wanted to stay in school, so that caused arguments. 

I also made the mistake of revealing to them an intimate part of myself I should've kept fucking hidden. 

Look, I won't say being on the street was “better”. 

But being away from that toxic environment was like a breath of fresh air. 

I lived in a pretty big town, and there were a lot of kids living on the streets. 

I did try and find somewhere at first. 

I stayed in hotels with my last remaining cash, but then I found myself with the option of eating or starving. I was VERY stubborn at sixteen. I hated asking for handouts, and just the idea of asking my school for help was like “losing”. 

I didn't want my friends and teachers to know about my situation, so I dropped school. Again, I was a stupid stubborn kid. 

I obviously should have asked for help, but back then, teachers didn't care. 

Kids in my school were severely bullied, and nothing ever changed. 

They were there to teach, and that was it. 

So, the thought of telling them I was fucking homeless just wasn't happening. 

I didn't want their pity. 

I didn't want their attempt to try empathize with me when in reality, they did not give a fuck. 

So, yes, I ended up on the streets. 

But there was a community of us. 

We were all in the same situation. Thrown out for the same reasons. 

Toxic and abusive parents, or significant others. 

So, all we had were each other. 

I've seen homeless kids depicted on TV/movies as scrappy pickpockets. 

That's a lie. The kids who I hung with weren't brave enough to pick-pocket. 

If they saw cash/food/anything they wanted hanging around unclaimed, they would snatch it up. 

The pickpocket thing is just the media glamorizing the idea of being a street kid, turning them into a “fun, quirky group of teenage criminals trying to survive.”

The reality is a lot more depressing. 

I ended up in a group of kids on the south side of our town. 

Ben, the leader of our gang, was the latest to disappear. 

Look, I didn't believe in the “child catcher” rumors. 

I thought they were just stories—but it became evident someone was actually kidnapping street kids. 

I may have come from a toxic house, but I was sheltered. 

I didn't think things like that existed. 

I had never been in the type of situation when they COULD exist. 

Kidnapping was like a foreign concept to me. 

It only happened in movies and cartoons. 

But then familiar faces I knew started to disappear– Carly, a street performer who was trying to earn enough money to leave town. Jason, the weird kid with the eyepatch who tried to steal my phone. 

These kids weren't friends, but they felt comfortable. 

They felt like a community, even when I wasn't personally close with them. 

Carly always smiled at me, offering me fresh donuts some old man handed her in the morning. 

Jason was always skulking around the music stores, asking for change. 

Every time I saw him, we talked about things that didn't even matter. 

But talking to him made me feel less alone. When Jason disappeared, that normalcy I’d gotten used to started to fade. I looked for him, but his familiar purple woolen hat had vanished. 

Carly was always singing under the bridge every afternoon. 

I could hear her voice while snoozing in the park entrance. She sounded like an angel. 

With her gone, I felt colder than usual. 

I couldn't get warm no matter how many times I rubbed my hands together and stuck my them under my coat. I had holes in my socks and shoes, and the freezing chill was creeping into my bones. 

Carly’s disappearance really shook me. 

Especially when, several days later, a guy took her spot with his guitar, screaming out painfully bad reimaginings of pop songs. 

When Ben vanished, I started taking word-of-mouth more seriously. 

*""He's been taken by the white van,""*  was the rumor floating around. 

Apparently, some kid saw Ben getting dragged into a white van. 

This kid was also known to say BS to get attention, but his claim was actually believable. 

Ben, Carly, Jason, and the other missing kids were last seen at the homeless shelter. 

So, the place where kids were vanishing—wasn't exactly ideal.

But it *did* have hot soup and coffee, as well as a place to charge my phone, so I risked it.

The homeless shelter was where most kids hung out every day. 

I used the mostly broken facilities to shower, use the bathroom, and try to make connections with kids who were well known. It was pretty much a survival instinct at this point. 

If I was going to survive on the streets, I needed people I could count on. 

I had this constant need to get my name out there. Just in case I was one of the missing. 

But it turns out, not all homeless kids play nice. 

I won't go into detail, but there were a lot of names I thought I could trust, and quickly learned that I couldn't fucking trust anyone. 

I got my (first) phone stolen, and then my shoes were snatched while I was sleeping. 

I was definitely hardened after a while on the streets. 

So, when Charlie came along, I basically told him to go fuck himself. 

All of the ‘connections’ I made just lost me cash, food, and my shit. The worst thing you can be as a street kid is nice. 

If you want to be left alone, you have to make it very fucking clear.

Without Ben’s leadership, things went off the handle. 

I was quickly labeled as a naive bastard who f/w anyone. 

Most of my spots were compromised, so I had no choice but to once again risk the homeless shelter. 

My initial plan was to grab food and coffee, and make a run for it. 

I had the town library as a safe spot until 4pm, and after 10, the guy who owned the Chinese takeout begrudgingly let me sleep in his doorway. 

I think he felt sorry for me. But at this point I was too fucking cold to care about pride. 

The volunteers in the soup kitchen were my age. I didn't know them (thankfully), but I was eager to get out of there. 

The food was a choice of cold curry or soup. I chose soup, and a chunk of stale bread. 

The coffee was always lukewarm, but it was coffee. I wasn't going to complain. 

I was trying to eat it as fast as I could without burning my mouth, when a kid I can only describe as the human embodiment of a golden retriever slid next to me, grasping his own bowl of soup.  

With dark brown hair under his hood and freckled cheeks— not to mention his expensive jacket and shoes—I knew the streets would eat him alive.

This kid looked like he'd stepped right out of a perfect suburban home. 

He had a Mommy and Daddy, and a perfect fucking life. Lucky him. 

I was having  a hard time taking in his expensive clothes. 

Yes, his hair was greasy and his clothes were slightly discolored (holes in his gloves, dirt smearing his face) so he was clearly sleeping rough. 

But this guy was ASKING to get his branded coat stolen. 

""Take *that* off,"" I said through a mouthful of stale bread.

That was all I could say. I didn't want to say “hi”, because *hi” was an invitation to join me. I was on my third phone, and I wasn't taking any chances with this kid. 

Two years of fucking with the wrong people, I was done. 

I nodded at his jacket, and he looked confused. 

“Huh?”

""Put it in your backpack, idiot.” I was just warning him of my past mistakes. 

I DID have my dad's expensive watch, and some shoes I bought with money from a summer job before I left home. 

I lost both of them because I failed to hide them. 

Elizabeth and Mari, two older girls I thought I could trust, were now proud owners of my shit. 

The guy had this docile look on his face, eyes wide like a fucking deer. 

I had no idea how he had survived this long. If he was sleeping in the shelter, yes it was “safer”, and warmer, but it also made him a target for kidnapping. 

“Unless you *want* to lose it.” I added, finishing my soup. 

The guy continued eating, completely unbothered. 

“Your jacket.” I said, directly. 

I didn't lose my patience much, but this guy was testing me. 

“Take it *off*, or you will lose it.”

After being fucked around with by Ben’s asshole friends, it felt strangely good to be an asshole back to a total stranger. 

The kid hesitated, before pulling off his jacket and backpack, awkwardly yanking off the jacket, and stuffing it inside his bag.

Then he sat there shivering like an idiot, and I gave up and offered him one of my spare sweaters. 

Street kids usually wanted something in return, and I was waiting for his proposition.

Instead, he said, “Thanks!” and pulled it on.

“I'm Charlie.” he introduced himself, when I stood to leave, grabbing my own pack. 

I told him I didn't ask, and that it was nice meeting him. 

When he followed me, I thought we were just going the same direction. 

But then I took a turn down an alleyway, and his footsteps hesitated, before coming after me.

I was all ready to tell him to beat it, but Charlie looked lost. 

He had this look on his face, like he was trying and failing to look intimidating. 

This kid didn't look like he was going to steal my shit while I was sleeping. 

I didn't officially ask him to join me, it just sort of happened? 

When I got back to my spot, he dropped his pack and started unrolling his sleeping bag next to mine.

I took advantage of his kindness, that innocence that was yet to be drained from him by every stone-cold night that never seemed to end. 

Midnight and dawn felt like centuries apart, and I was never warm enough. 

My toes were always numb, my fingers losing all feeling. 

The worst part was when I didn't have enough to eat, so I started fantasizing. 

But Charlie never lost that stupid fucking smile. Even when he was freezing to death. 

I told him to grab us food for the night– and he came back with two pizza rolls, and a can of soda to share. 

I asked him *how* he'd gotten them, and he shrugged with a grin. 

This kid expected me to play along with his cryptic games every time he did something vaguely helpful. 

I didn't care how he'd gotten them. 

I was just thankful. 

I started to see Charlie as less of a nuisance, and more of a friend. 

Charlie was loud and obnoxious, and drove me insane with his ‘dreams’ of getting out of town and his situation. 

But he  made me smile—even in freezing temperatures. 

He never told me about *why* he was on the streets. 

Instead, he always changed the subject back to me. 

I didn't realize how self centered I was until I spilled my entire life story to him, and when he opened up about himself, I started talking about *myself* once again. 

In a way, I think I saw it like a competition. “Oh, your life is bad? Well, *this* happened to me.”

I waited for him to get frustrated or angry, but he just listened. 

He always listened. 

It was snowing when the two of us sat shivering on a wall, our legs dangling. 

I don't remember who's genius idea it was to sit in sub zero temperatures, but I remember enjoying the icy breeze on my face. Everything was covered in white. 

I don't think I should have enjoyed snow. 

It was extremely fucking easy to freeze to death in these conditions. 

But it was also *snow*. 

And I was still a stupid kid. I still liked snow. 

Charlie was, as usual, being his chipper self. 

He scored us a pack of chips to share, so we were passing it back and forth. 

My hands were so numb I couldn't even feel the chips. I just stuffed them in my mouth. ""Do you believe in angels, Finn?"" 

That question caught me off guard. Charlie’s gaze was glued to a little girl perfecting a snow angel in front of us. 

The answer was no.

I didn't believe in God. Any God's. Any religion. 

If God existed, or the “angels”, my parents wouldn't have kicked me out for liking guys. 

In the earlier days, I prayed for help.

I had the stupid idea that my mom would actually hunt me down and take me back home. 

But God didn't exist, at least not to me—and I was tired of pretending. 

I didn't respond to Charlie, and his head dropped onto my shoulder. 

I jerked back, swallowing a hiss. I shoved him away, and for the first time since I'd met him, his smile started to fade. 

""Sorry,"" he muttered, rubbing his hands together. Charlie seemed to notice our proximity, shuffling away from me. 

He said I was warm, and I hated myself for shouting at him. 

Because he was fucking warm too. 

I liked the feeling of his head on my shoulder. 

He felt safe and warm, and the closest thing I had to a home. 

I jumped off the wall, making an excuse to distance myself. 

I think I told him I was going to the shelter to try to find warm clothes from the lost and found. 

Charlie didn't reply, only jerking his head in a nod. 

He told me he’d be right there when I got back, and his words settled my twisting gut, the growing lump in my throat. 

I used my time away from him to come to terms with my feelings, and instead of pushing them away, like I had done for so long, suppressing and fucking swallowing them down, I realized I wanted Charlie to stay with me. 

Charlie was Home. 

I had barely known this kid for a few months, and yet with him, I didn't feel cold anymore. 

I went back to the wall, ready to apologize to Charlie, but to my surprise, he was gone. I figured he'd gone searching for food since it was almost around dinner time, so I waited. 

I waited until the sky was dark, and I was so fucking cold, my bones ached. 

I noticed an old man who was playing chess with pigeons earlier. 

Charlie had pointed him out, laughing at one particular pigeon, who seemed too self aware. 

I hurried over to him. 

“Did you see me earlier?” I twisted around, pointing at the wall the two of us sat on. 

The man nodded. “Oh, you're looking for your friend?” He slid another chess piece across the board. “I believe he walked away with a man a few hours ago now.”

“What man?” I felt like I was going to puke. 

I asked him to describe the guy, but the old man shrugged. 

“I have bad eyes, kid. It was just a man. Late forties, I think.” 

His expression softened when my stomach crawled into my throat. 

“Are you all right?” he reached into his pocket and pulled out a sour candy, dropping it into my hand. 

“You should go home now, kid. I'm sure your parents are worried about you.”

Again, I asked him to describe this man, this time through my teeth. 

But the old guy just turned back to his one-man chess game. 

I think part of me was in denial. 

I went back to our sleeping spot, expecting Charlie to be there, already comfortable in his sleeping bag, talking about optimistic BS. 

But he wasn't. 

I ran back to the shelter with his name choked in my mouth. 

I was living my own personal nightmare. Being snatched into the night, and nobody even knowing my name. 

I just got weird looks, kids looking progressively more freaked out. 

I wouldn't accept it at first. 

Charlie could have been anywhere. But the longer I waited for him in all of our spots, It became clear that Charlie was just another missing street kid who was there one minute, and gone the next. 

He was another Ben. 

Another Carly. 

But this time, I made the mistake of getting to know him.

He was more than a name. 

Charlie was my friend. 

I asked strangers if they'd seen him. 

Passers by looked me up and down like I was dirt on their shoe.

These people had places to be. 

They didn't care about some faceless kid disappearing from the street. 

I already knew what they were thinking when they offered pitiful smiles, and said things like: *“Sorry, I don't know.”*

*""I can't help you, kid. I'm... sure he's out there somewhere.""*

They were wondering *why* Charlie was sleeping rough in the first place. 

Why he didn't just ‘get help’. 

I'm going to tell you the hardest thing I've come to realize. 

It's easy to be numb on the streets. 

Easy to shut down. Easy to forget to mourn, because it was too fucking cold. 

I didn't forget about Charlie, but I did bury him, so I wouldn't forget how to survive. 

So, a month later, I thought I was fucking hallucinating when I saw that all too familiar jacket; the one I told him MULTIPLE TIMES to keep out of sight. 

It was snowing again, and it was thick and wet, clinging to my jeans. 

I was trying to find a patch of concrete free of snow to dump my sleeping bag. 

I scored hand warmers from one kid who was nice enough to offer them for a DS I'd found. 

There he was. Somehow. 

Charlie was standing in the middle of an empty road, in dead of night. 

I didn't question why or *how*. I just hugged him, mentally promising myself I would never let him go again. 

Charlie was so warm.

His coat was thicker, and his backpack was nowhere to be seen. 

""Where did you go?!"" I demanded, shoving him back. 

Charlie just smiled, and I noticed his pocket, an iphone sticking out. 

I think I was about to laugh, wondering just how he’d managed to get an iPhone, when a clammy hand suddenly clamped over my mouth. 

Warm arms wrapped around my torso and yanked me back. 

I screamed, but my cries were muffled—the hand clamping tighter until I couldn’t fucking breathe.

I remember being violently dragged back, my feet stumbling, my body struggling to stay upright.

I was dragged halfway down the street, hoisted onto a stranger’s shoulders, and dumped into the back of an awaiting van.

It didn't feel like it was happening to me. 

All those nights I had nightmares about being the next kid snatched away. 

I never thought it would be *me*. 

I couldn't even cry out, my body felt paralyzed. 

I was dragged backwards through snow, and then I was on my knees on the ice-cold flooring of a van jerking left to right, staring at shutters being pulled down like I was an animal. 

I dived forward, but I was trapped.

""I'm sorry, Finn,"" Charlie’s voice pricked the silence. The back of the van was so cold, and the smell was already there—potent, a thick, rotting decay.

“But you're the perfect body and shape for my father,” he said, his voice deadpan and wrong. 

“I hope this doesn't change things between us,” he whispered.

His voice was different—taunting and cold—sending shivers down my spine.

“We’re still friends, right?”

I fucking screamed at him.

That bastard.

He played the role so well, I should have fucking applauded him.

I slammed my fists into the shutters, but the ignition came to life, and the van jerked forward, sending me stumbling back.

I dropped to my knees, choking on the stink of decay. I didn't want to look.

The light was too bright, too invasive, scorching the chill from my skin.

I stayed on my knees until the smell got so bad, I had to fucking look.

In front of me were bodies. Most of them were faceless, with no features, skin already crumbling from bones jutting out.

One of them caught my eye, lying at the bottom of the pile.

Ben. His skin was gray, dried blood staining his face, painting his clothes. 

I was already trying to roll him onto his front, so I didn't have to look at him. His eyes were open, like he was still alive.

I shoved him onto his stomach, and something sour crawled up my throat, my stomach revolting.

I thought I was seeing things. But no.

When I reached forward, my fingers touched them—the twisted, feathery appendages protruding from twin slits cruelly sliced into a jutting spine.

I shuffled back, a cry clawing from my throat.

Wings.

They were rotten, decaying—the wings of a bird, or something else—spliced with his flesh. I could see where his back had been cut open, all the way down his spine. Ben was dead.

His wings were dying, festering inside a body that was ice-cold and alone, where he would never be found. That thought was quick to hit me. *Just like me*.

Carly’s short brown curls were buried under another corpse, a much younger kid.

I could still see the pale blue of her coat, her yellow hat still frozen to her head.

Carly had one singular wing sticking from her back, while the rest of her rotted away.

I tripped over something—Carly’s backpack.

I could glimpse Jason's kicks sticking out from the pile.

I couldn't look.

They had names. They were real kids. Carly. Ben. Jason.

They existed. Even if this world was so obsessed with fucking erasing them.

""Finn?"" Charlie's whisper slipped through the shutters.

I held onto his voice, willing it to be him.

Charlie.

""Do you believe in angels?” he asked me once again.

He still had that voice—that innocent, chipper tone I fell for.

But there was an unmistakable twisting madness clinging to every word.

I didn't respond. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

After a while, his voice stopped trying to get my attention.

I just sat, freezing cold, my arms around my knees.

I was going to fucking die.

I kept looking at the kids who vanished, their bodies twisted and contorted into a cruel fantasy. The van stopped when I was falling asleep, jerking me awake.

I heard footsteps outside. The shutters slid open, and in front of me, to my surprise, was a middle-aged woman.

Her smile was kind, despite the gleam in her eye.

She held out her arms, gesturing for me to come toward her.

“It's okay, honey,” she told me. “You're okay now.”

Charlie was standing next to her, his arms folded.

“Careful,” he muttered, nudging her. I saw his lip curl in disgust. 

Illuminated in the van’s headlights, I saw who really was; a spoiled, psychotic kid playing with his toys. 

Charlie mockingly stepped back. 

“He might attack you.”

Behind him stood a towering man, holding a gun pointing it between my eyes.

I had no choice, letting them pull me from the van.

The man was quick to slip a shot into the back of my neck, which turned my body to lead.

I was lifted into someone's arms. I remember they were warm.

The last thing I remember is a bright light getting closer.

I don't know how long I was out for. Long enough to get an actual, proper sleep.

When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the sun peeking through gaps in a wooden door, my head turned at an awkward angle. 

It looked like I was in some kind of farmhouse. I could see piles of hay and horse shit in the corner. I was lying on my stomach, my wrists pinned down. 

The pain crept in slowly—at first a dull thud, before slamming into me, agonizing lightning bolts striking down my spine.

So fucking painful, my vision blurred and feathered, losing focus.

I've had sensory issues since I was a kid, and I could feel the entirety of my upper back had been split open.

I could feel my own blood dripping down my skin, and something cruel and sharp forcing flaps of flesh apart. 

The thought of being cut open was enough to send me into fucking hysteria. I remember screaming until my throat was raw, until I passed out again. 

This time, it was a mercy. 

The pain wouldn't leave, pulling me into agony, and then letting me go.

When I came around for the second time, I felt the ice-cold scalpel slicing into my back.

But I didn't feel like I was cut open anymore. I felt a painful tugging when I tried to move. Stitches holding me together.

“That's all finished,” the man’s voice sounded. “The body is almost ready.”

“But when?”

That voice sent shivers creeping down my spine.

Charlie.

“You said that last time, and the last three angels *died*, Dad.” 

I could sense his rolled eyes. 

“Admit that you're just killing them, and you have no idea what you're doing.”

“I said he's ready,” the man grumbled.

“So, let him fly!” Charlie groaned. “Come on, Dad, I want to see the angel fly!”

I was aware I was gasping into the cold surface of the surgical table.

“His stitches are still fresh,” the man said. “When he's ready, you can play with him.”

I was left alone after that.

Hours.

Then, a full day.

But I wasn't hungry anymore. I wasn't thirsty. I didn't sleep.

I was trying to find the best position to lie on (on my side) when footsteps startled me.

“Hey, Finn.”

Charlie's voice was an excited whisper. I felt his warm fingers tiptoe down my back before reaching for my restraints.

He pulled them apart, helping me up, and I immediately dragged my hand down my back, where I was sure I’d touch my ugly, protruding spine. But instead, I felt smooth skin.

Slowly, I lowered myself off the table. Charlie was holding my backpack.

“Here!” he said excitedly, shoving it into my chest.

“Dad says I'm not allowed to let you go yet, but I'm too impatient.” 

His eyes never left my back.

Without responding, I took my backpack, shoved past him, and broke into a sprint.

I pushed through the doors of the farmhouse and kept running.

I expected to be grabbed and pulled back. But I wasn't. 

Charlie just stood there watching me, grinning, an inhuman grin stretched across his face. 

I didn't stop until I couldn't breathe, until I was on my knees, on some unfamiliar road in the middle of nowhere. 

I was picked up by a woman who offered to take me to the sheriff's station. She gave me hot tea and food, but I declined both. 

I wasn't hungry, and my body didn't feel like my own. 

When we got into town, and I was sure I knew where I was, I dived out of her car. 

I went to the restroom, pulled off my shirt, and ran my fingers down my back. 

I could *feel* them. 

Something was moving under my skin, twitching, like they were alive. 

When I gingerly touched my skin, I could feel tiny stitches all the way down my spine. 

Part of me wondered what would happen if I ripped them open. 

After a single restless night on the street, I realized I couldn't fucking do it anymore. 

I ended up asking for help when the pain in my back kept me up at night.

I could feel them physically trying to push through my skin, straining against my spine. I couldn't sleep on my back, or my side. The best sleeping position was lying on my stomach. 

Winter moved into spring, and I felt like I was dying. I couldn't eat, and I was weak. 

I think it was luck. Maybe a miracle. 

I walked into one of my old teachers. Mrs W. She didn't ask about my situation, but she did offer a place to stay. 

That was the best thing about Mrs W. 

No matter how much I knew she wanted to ask, she never invaded my privacy. She saw the scars on my back, saw me puke up everything I ate. 

But she didn't speak.

Mrs W asked me if I wanted to share anything with her, and I said, “No.”

If anyone knew what was inside my back, I’d be sliced open again. 

I was nineteen at this point– and I was tired and in too much pain to care about accepting handouts. 

Mrs W let me sleep in her spare room. She offered me food, but I could never eat it. 

I could only drink water, and even that was hard to stomach. 

She took me to the emergency room to get my back checked out, but after I suffered a panic attack at the thought of opening up to a doctor, she promised *no hospitals*. 

The pain got worse. It fucking laughed at medication. 

It got so bad, one night, I stood on the roof of Mrs W’s house, and let the pain take over, ripping through me, until something was splitting my spine, sending me to my knees.

I could feel them coming through, breaking through my skin.

They felt wrong and awkward, like additional limbs. I panicked, and with shaking hands, forced the twitching *things* back into twin slits. 

That did relieve the pain.

I still couldn't eat or drink, but I started to feel human again. 

Mrs W offered to send me back to school, and I did. I went back to finish high school. 

The eating/drinking thing got easier. 

I think my body just got used to it. 

After school, I got into community college, and Mrs W helped me buy my first place. 

I grew up, with the gnawing feeling that something wasn't *right* with me.

The pain was still agonizing, and at times, I would have to rip open the stitches, and let them free. I've never once tried to figure them out, because I'm fucking terrified of them. 

I'm 29 now. 

I live far away from my hometown. I have a boyfriend, and an apartment, and I finally feel human again. 

Last night, I was waiting for a train home. It was freezing, and already, I could feel my back twitching, pain starting to gnaw at me. 

It's worse these days. Not just the pain. I'm sleepwalking. 

I'll find myself blocks away from my house, with no recollection of how I got there. 

I don't know why I'm no different from my teenage self. 

I still don't want to ask help, because whatever is inside me isn't fucking human. 

So, I kept my mouth shut. 

There was a homeless girl slumped in the corner of the platform. 

I've made it my goal. 

Whenever I see a homeless kid, I point them to the nearest shelter– and when they roll their eyes at me, I offer to take them there myself. 

I don't leave them until I know these kids are safe. Yes, they can be difficult.

They're a lot more vocal these days. Kids hate authority figures. 

Especially authority figures that failed them. 

But I want to make it clear to them that they CAN ask for them. And there IS help. 

I was already halfway across the platform when I glimpsed familiar brown curls nestled under a green beanie. 

I knew it was him. He was wearing that exact same jacket, clinging to a wider frame. He was taller, his face more matured, with a five o’clock shadow, talking loudly on an expensive phone.

I took my eyes off of the girl for one second. 

One second. 

I turned back to her, and she was gone. Just like that. 

When I searched the crowd, I caught her blonde ponytail behind her. 

A man pulling her through strangers. 

I started forwards, when someone pulled me back. 

“No, Finn.” Charlie's voice was in my ear, suddenly. 

“She has the perfect shape and body for my father,” he murmured. 

His voice kept me paralyzed, while the girl was getting further and further away, before becoming a speck, and then bleeding into nothing. 

“I want to see you fly, Finn,” Charlie whispered. 

I twisted around, and he was gone. 

When I left the train station, sitting on a bench was his old threaded backpack. 

Nothing inside, but I know why he left it. 

He's telling me he's watching me. 

Charlie is bragging that he's taking more kids right in front of me. 

I've looked everywhere for the girl, and I can't find her. 

When I asked a group of street kids, they were defensive, clearly not trusting me, before I warned them someone was kidnapping them. 

They told me three guys, and a girl (the blonde) have all vanished. 

I asked *when*, and that's when they started getting suspicious. 

They left without telling me, and I've spent the last week looking for these kids. 

The only way I'm going to find these kids is to find the sick bastard who took me. 

Before he does to them, what he did to Ben, Carly and Jason.

1kdas99,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1kdas99/montessori_or_playbased_3k/,Montessori or play-based 3K?,"Hey parents! Looking for input on my son’s foray into preschool. I’ll try to keep this to the relevant details!

We have three options: stay in his current in-home daycare, attend the YMCA-run Montessori preschool, or attend the YMCA-play-based preschool. He’ll be in before and after school care at any of these options because we’re both FT working parents. 

The Montessori preschool has full use of an old church school, and has two small 3-5-year-old classes, a low-ish ratio (maybe like 8 kids?), and has a small outdoor play area. Lunches are not included, and it’s $963/month for nine months – no summer care. It’s 20 minutes away.

The play-based preschool is at an elementary school (but kept separated), and has a 3-4-year-old class; ratios are 6:1. It has access to a huge green space with a playground. Lunches are not included, and it’s $1,280/month for nine months – no summer care. It’s also 20 minutes away.

Our current daycare is a licensed in-home option at about 8 kids with two FT people, the owner and her assistant. She has a large backyard but has the TV on often. Lunch and snacks are included but we’re unsure of what she serves because she’s stopped providing menus. It’s $1,200/month and is ~15 minutes away. 

My kid has always been independent. Since he could sit up, I could enjoy a coffee and he’d happily play for 20 minutes. Now he can do two hours of independent play and is both methodical and increasingly imaginative/creative. He still wants us to play with him, of course, but he’s capable of that length of focus. He’s always been ahead vocab-wise; he’s insanely articulate. He’s also “blossoming” into a defiant, rambunctious preschooler. He’s getting loud, has lots of energy, and ascribes to the church of “NO!”

I’m leaning toward one of the preschools vs. his daycare. I’ve toured both and the vibes were similar, which makes the choice harder. We could consider play-based this year and Montessori next (or vice versa), but unfortunately, neither are in our school district so he’d only go through 4K regardless. (Is that an issue?!)

I could see his independence serving him well in a Montessori setting, but I don’t want to stifle his newfound creativity. I’m also worried about defiance being an issue. I think a play-based school would be great for socialization and getting his energy out, but I’d wonder if he was missing out on the “learning” at the Montessori.

Any thoughts or advice is so appreciated because I could see him doing well at either option!",0,1746217227.0,toddlers,0,0.33,False

1kdaqyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kdaqyr/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_brother_knowing/,AITA for calling the cops on my brother knowing my parents never wanted anyone to?,"My brother (17) has been angry and violent since we were really young. It's always freaky to see him lose his shit like he does. He has all these diagnosed issues and he's been to hospitals and treatment places 5+ times. I (15) try to avoid him but he seeks me out sometimes to yell into my face or to try and beat me up. He was always aggressive with me like that. He wouldn't always hit me. Sometimes he'd grab me and shake me. One time he was in a rage and I locked myself in my room but he broke my door and my dad had to pull him off me and lock him and my brother into the bathroom.

My parents always begged people not to call the cops. They said they didn't want him going to jail because it won't help him and the hospitals he goes to are what he really needs. Some of our family have stopped talking to us because of that decision. But my parents stand by it. They're so afraid of him ending up in jail.

Last weekend he came home after being in one of those treatment places again for almost 2.5 months. He was really fucking angry and the night he came home he punched a hole in my bedroom wall and he broke the coffee table. The day after he came home he was more aggressive with us and yelled at all three of us and pushed me. By 3pm he was was telling me how much he wanted to kick my ass and snap my neck and bury me in the yard. He tried to elbow me in the stomach but I dodged it. But then he did kick me in the shins and he pinned me against the couch. Dad had to pull him off me again. When I got free and went to my room I did call the cops. I didn't want to live like that anymore and none of my family wanted to take me in so I called.

The cops came and my brother was in the middle of a meltdown when they came so they arrested him. My parents thought our neighbor had called at first because she had made some comments before. But by the following morning they figured out it was me and they were angry. They told me I had defied their wishes and that was wrong.

So now even though my brother isn't here my parents are super pissed and all their focus is on getting my brother out.

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I’m all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I’m also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I’m looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn’t mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you’re someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

Also, there's a photo on my profile, would be great to see yours too",1,1746217125.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Tyler: Seems to me that you’re still obsessing on the little things instead of enjoying the small details that bring joy to you.

Kirby: I just said “I made it!”

Tyler: This is all part of the creative process. This is the part where you’re starting to learn what possesses you to obsess.

Kirby: I’m learning what causes me distress, yes.
That doesn’t mean it’s helping me go back to being serene.
It’s just confirming that I don’t feel comfortable being seen.

Tyler: If that’s all you intend to glean from this idiotic recounting of what you see as mounting pressure while you’re just trying to get coffee—then that’s all on you, boo.

1kdaqfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1kdaqfc/montessori_or_playbased_3k/,Montessori or play-based 3K?,"Hey parents! Looking for input on my son’s foray into preschool. I’ll try to keep this to the relevant details!

We have three options: stay in his current in-home daycare, attend the YMCA-run Montessori preschool, or attend the YMCA-play-based preschool. He’ll be in before and after school care at any of these options because we’re both FT working parents. 

The Montessori preschool has full use of an old church school, and has two small 3-5-year-old classes, a low-ish ratio (maybe like 8 kids?), and has a small outdoor play area. Lunches are not included, and it’s $963/month for nine months – no summer care. It’s 20 minutes away.

The play-based preschool is at an elementary school (but kept separated), and has a 3-4-year-old class; ratios are 6:1. It has access to a huge green space with a playground. They also collab with the special ed preschool class to offer a more diverse/inclusive environment for all kids. Lunches are not included, and it’s $1,280/month for nine months – no summer care. It’s also 20 minutes away.

Our current daycare is a licensed in-home option at about 8 kids with two FT people, the owner and her assistant. She has a large backyard but has the TV on often. Lunch and snacks are included but we’re unsure of what she serves because she’s stopped providing menus. It’s $1,200/month and is ~15 minutes away. 

My kid has always been independent. Since he could sit up, I could enjoy a coffee and he’d happily play for 20 minutes. Now he can do two hours of independent play and is both methodical and increasingly imaginative/creative. He still wants us to play with him, of course, but he’s capable of that length of focus. He’s always been ahead vocab-wise; he’s insanely articulate. He’s also “blossoming” into a defiant, rambunctious preschooler. He’s getting loud, has lots of energy, and ascribes to the church of “NO!”

I’m leaning toward one of the preschools vs. his daycare. I’ve toured both and the vibes were similar, which makes the choice harder. We could consider play-based this year and Montessori next (or vice versa), but unfortunately, neither are in our school district so he’d only go through 4K regardless. (Is that an issue?!)

I could see his independence serving him well in a Montessori setting, but I don’t want to stifle his newfound creativity. I’m also worried about defiance being an issue. I think a play-based school would be great for socialization and getting his energy out, but I’d wonder if he was missing out on “learning” at the Montessori.

Any thoughts or advice is so appreciated because I could see him doing well at either option!",1,1746217097.0,Parenting,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/bIhpl9X)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

1kdamwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsCalls/comments/1kdamwh/mcdonalds_mcd_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_from/,"McDonalds (MCD): The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly from MCD's Earnings Call","\- May 01, 2025

## The Good 🍔✨

- **Resilience in Challenging Times:** Despite macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical uncertainty, management emphasized McDonald’s ability to weather tough conditions and outperform competitors, thanks to brand strength and global scale.
- **Strong Value Initiatives:** The introduction and expansion of value platforms (McValue in the U.S., EDAP menus internationally) are resonating, especially the $5 Meal Deal, which is driving incremental visits.
- **Positive Guest Count Gap:** McDonald’s outperformed most near-end competitors in guest count, indicating market share gains even as overall traffic fell.
- **Record Customer Satisfaction:** Customer satisfaction scores hit all-time highs in the U.S. and nearly all major international markets.
- **Menu Innovation:** Successful launches like the Minecraft Movie Meal and upcoming McCrispy Chicken Strips and Snack Wraps aim to drive both traffic and check growth.
- **Operational Execution:** Focus on operational excellence and improved execution, with realignment of roles and creation of the Restaurant Experience Team for faster innovation.
- **Margin Strength:** Adjusted operating margin remains robust at about 45.5%, demonstrating business model durability.
- **International Highlights:** Canada saw both positive comp sales and guest count, and France delivered its first market share gains in nearly three years.
- **Reaffirmed Guidance:** Full-year 2025 financial targets were reaffirmed, and foreign currency translation shifted from expected headwind to a tailwind.
- **Long-Term Focus:** Continued investment in digital, technology, and efficiency transformation for sustainable growth.

---

## The Bad 🍟😕

- **Comp Sales Decline:** Global comparable sales declined 1% (flat when adjusting for Leap Day), with U.S. comps down 3.6%—both worse than anticipated.
- **Traffic Pressure Broadening:** Not just low-income consumers, but now middle-income consumers are reducing QSR visits—industry traffic fell more than expected in key markets.
- **Inflation Still a Drag:** Commodity inflation, especially in Europe (notably beef), continues to pressure margins and requires careful pricing decisions.
- **Mixed International Results:** International Operated Markets segment saw a 1% comp sales decline, with negative comps in the UK and contraction in Germany and Australia.
- **UK Underperformance:** McDonald’s is not gaining share in the UK and admits it’s losing share to competitors it should be beating, mainly due to execution issues.
- **Modest Margin Growth Outlook:** Margins are only expected to be “slightly up” for the year in the U.S., and top-line growth is necessary to drive meaningful improvement.

---

## The Ugly 🍔☁️

- **Significant U.S. Traffic Erosion:** QSR industry traffic from low-income consumers in the U.S. was down nearly double digits, with middle-income traffic also sharply lower—a sign of broad-based economic strain.
- **Persistent Consumer Uncertainty:** Management remains “cautious about the overall health of the consumer” and sees ongoing macro headwinds.
- **Negative Mix Shift Risk:** Increased focus on value may lead to negative mix shift (lower average check), particularly until more full-margin innovation and premium menu news come through in later quarters.
- **Boycott/Brand Risk:** While management reports no direct impact on McDonald’s from rising anti-American sentiment in some international markets, they acknowledge an 8–10 point uptick in such sentiment, especially in Northern Europe and Canada.
- **Execution Dependency:** The outlook for improvement is heavily dependent on flawless execution of value, marketing, and menu innovation—any slip could prolong the downturn.
- **Competitive Pressure from Specialists:** Increasing competition from category specialists (in chicken, beverages, etc.) is forcing McDonald’s to reorganize and sharpen focus, which carries execution risk during transition.
