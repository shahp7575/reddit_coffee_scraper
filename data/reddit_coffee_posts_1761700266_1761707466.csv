( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I will always be an addict, but there's been many ways I was able to work around my addiction we're over the past 12 years, there has been 13 times where I stopped for 14 days or longer and all the qualities were quite exceptional. However none of them would last upon a relapse.

I haven't smoked any weed in almost 2 weeks now and the first few days we're pretty rough but now it's starting to get a lot better and when I get paid on Halloween, it'll be very tempting to get THC candy. 

I usually smoke flower, but now I've been considering government edibles here which are limited to 10 mg per pack so that may be something I might benefit from. 

At many times weed has absolutely impacted my life very negatively but other times I was recovering from my addiction fairly well. 

I can't be doing this forever especially since I'm unemployed I'd really like to get back to the lifestyle I wanted and actually be able to save up money for things they want to do and travel around Canada. 

It's going to take a lot of work and commitment though to be able to stay off it for a long time again because I really miss my vivid and lucid dreaming. 

My dreams got absolutely crazy during my two biggest cannabis free breaks, both just short of 60 days but well over 50. My third biggest cannabis break was also over 50 but that was back in 2014, when I lost my license at 19. ",1,1761706581.0,rant,1,0.99,False

I got defensive and started listing everything I did that day: 3 meetings, shipped a feature, reviewed code, etc. Then I realized: from his perspective, I did nothing.

He didn't see me:

* Commute for 90 minutes
* Sit in an office where a manager can see me working
* Attend a physical meeting where I'm clearly present
* Stay late to show commitment

All the performative BS that makes office work look like work.

What he did see:

* Me making coffee at 9:47am
* Me on my couch with my laptop 
* Me laughing during a Zoom call 
* Me finishing at 5:00pm sharp

The entire older generation was conditioned to equate ""looking busy"" with ""being productive."" And WFH removes all those visual cues.

I'm not saying they're right, I'm way more productive at home. But I do get why they can't wrap their heads around it. They literally cannot see the work happening.

I am a sales person for some medical AI products. Most days begin with coffee and mess. I start my laptop and deal with emails and missed calls. My AI set up is quiet but does its work. asksurf is on — I just type “give me news on acme and funding “ and when I am done looking at slack, it has given me a short note with links. No silliness, no going through 10 pages. I sound much more ready in client calls now.When the meetings start, proactor.ai moves in. It listens, writes notes, and reads things I miss — for instance when someone says “let’s look at pricing again,” proactor makes it a follow-up. After the call, I no longer need to see the recordings, I just read the summary and hit send on the follow-up email that is auto-made.By the close of day walnut.ai reminds me about a client I had not spoken to in a while. It is like my second brain on my shoulder saying, “hey, you talked to sam last week — look at his new product launch.” It even writes what I want to say, so I just change a few words and use it. Two days later, sam responds and we have one more meeting. That is one more lead can be alive still, no mental work.When I need to prepare a proposal or learn something about my clients’ work I open OpenAI atlas. It is nice that it knows what I looked at. So if I look at logistics startups this week and fintech next, it does not merge the two. It is like an AI intern that works for me.Sometimes I finish my day using makeform to make a small “post-demo feedback form”. or if I recording the text for product demos, vozo translates it into spanish or chinese for clients on the move. It is like my tiny team just got global. I will not lie, not every AI works, but this feels like the first time ever this type of AI made my work as a sale so much easier.Less busy work, less follow up, more real time with people where I need to be. I no longer feel like I am drowning in admin work — only talking and making deals that matter.Does anyone else here use AI that way?

For the longest time, I told myself it’s fine. Everyone has close friends. But over time, little things started stacking up.

Like, she’d text him every morning. She knows his coffee order. She sends him memes about “our chaotic energy.” He calls her when he’s stressed before he calls me.

I brushed it off until last week. We were watching TV, and he got a text from her saying, “You left your charger again 😒 guess I’ll keep it hostage.”

I asked, “Why were you at her place?” He said, “She needed help hanging shelves.”

That was at 11 p.m.

When I told him that crossed a line, he said I was being controlling and that “she’s basically my sister.” But here’s the kicker, she has a boyfriend, too. I found his Instagram and she hasn’t posted him once in a year.

So I messaged her boyfriend (I know, probably not my best move). He replied: “Yeah, I’ve been wondering the same thing about them.”

Upskill NOW for the AI Workforce Revolution 🤖 (Limited Seats!),"Okay, so, am I the only one feeling like they’re living in some kind of sci-fi movie all of a sudden? Seriously, AI is *everywhere* now.

It’s kinda exciting, but also… terrifying, right? Like, are our jobs even going to *exist* in a few years? I saw this headline the other day about AI writing entire novels and I almost choked on my coffee!

Honestly, it got me thinking. I’m no tech genius, but I’m also not about to get left in the dust. So, I’ve been doing some digging, trying to figure out how to actually *use* this stuff to my advantage.

It’s not just about *knowing* AI exists. It’s about understanding how it can boost your current skills. Think of it like adding superpowers to what you already do.

*   **Automation is key.** Finding those tasks that AI can take off your plate? Game changer.
*   **Learn prompt engineering!** Seriously. It's the secret sauce to getting AI to do what you want.
*   **Focus on uniquely human skills.** Creativity, critical thinking, empathy... AI can't replicate that (yet!).

But where do you even start, right? It all feels so overwhelming. That's how I felt at least.

Then, I stumbled across this program—Automate It Pro—(yeah, it has an affiliate link here: [https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals](https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals)), and honestly, it's been a lifesaver. It’s about learning to *use* AI, not just being scared of it. It's about automating tasks and making life easier, so you can free up some space for the important stuff in life.

It got me thinking... are we focusing too much on the robots *taking* jobs, and not enough on the *new* jobs they're creating? Jobs that require a *different* skillset, sure, but still… jobs.

Maybe the real revolution isn't robots replacing us, but robots *augmenting* us. Making us better, faster, stronger (okay, maybe not stronger... *yet*).

I feel normal for the first time in at least 15 years.  I had always, what I believe, self medicated with coffee.  I never enjoyed it, I only felt like I needed it because I was soooo exhausted all the time and my energy and concentration were non existent.

The first week I was still drinking coffee but felt I didn't even need it anymore.  I just did it out of habit and the fear of letting go of that comfort.  Well it's been 10 days now and I haven't had any and the Vyvanse feels smoother.  I also feel calmer and less on edge then the first week or before starting Vyvanse.

Just wondering how many of you decided to stop completely instead of just reducing since Vyvanse seems to work much better for energy, concentration and appetite suppression (something I really needed) than caffeine does.

That's a fair question. We have a body that's been ID'd, we have suspects, we have charges, and we have convictions. Lacey Fletcher's death lead to a guilty plea of manslaughter by her parents. What's the mystery here?

Well, according to Cambridge Dictionary, a mystery is:

>**something** [strange](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/strange) **or not** [known](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/known) **that has not** [yet](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/yet) **been** [explained](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/explain) **or** [understood](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/understood)

And I believe the circumstances around this case fits quite well within this definition. So, without further ado, let's examine the circumstances of this case.

On January 3rd, 2022, at around 2am Lacey's mother Sheila Fletcher called 911 to report her daughter, Lacey wasn't breathing. The circumstances surrounding the 911 call aren't clear, but I've seen it reported the call was prompted by a neighbor noticing Lacey's condition and basically telling the Fletchers if they wouldn't call 911, he would. Dispatch sent a sheriff's deputy to the Fletcher home. Upon arriving, the deputy found 36 year old Lacey Fletcher dead on the family's couch. The circumstances surrounding this finding was shocking.

I can't find much direct testimony from the sheriff who first responded, however what he found caused him to immediately call the county coroner, Dr Ewell Bickham. According to Dr. Bickham, upon approaching the home he ""Opened the door, walked into the house, there was a stench, an odor, feces, fecal material, urine, you couldn’t hold your breath.""

Lacey Fletcher's body was sunken into what can only be described as an erosion in the couch cushions, her face was covered with feces and red splotches, and her body was surrounded by urine and feces, which pooled into the divot in the couch cushions where her body was found. Additionally, feces was found smeared on her torso and hair. In addition to feces, her hair was knotted and crawling with maggots. Her body also had severe ulcers which were deep enough to expose her bone. Her stomach contents contained feces and foam from the couch cushions where her body was found. Near her body, on a coffee table by the couch, wipes, lotion, and a box containing DVDs of children's movies was recovered. The coroner, Dr. Bickham, determined Lacey had been dead 24-48 hours when the 911 call was made.

These circumstances are obviously horrific, but they also beg the question: How the hell does something like this happen?

Lacey, by all accounts I can find, lived a normal childhood into her teen years. Some of her teachers reporting her falling behind academically and socially in her final year of school, and her parents pulled her out of school in 2002 at the age of 17, and homeschool her for the remainder of her education.

Lacey's parents claim she was diagnosed with social anxiety and autism. Some reports have claimed she had ""locked-in"" syndrome, however I'm not able to verify any of these diagnoses. She was last seen in 2010, exercising outside of the house by a neighbor. Given her death in 2022, it is believed she was confined mostly to the couch where her body was found for 12 years.

Lacey's parents were originally charged with 2nd degree homicide; however they eventually plead guilty to manslaughter in 2024. They are currently serving 20 year sentences

That's more or less where Lacey Fletcher's story ends. Apologies if this ending isn't satisfying, few mysteries are. I do think the following questions need to be asked though:

\-Lacey seemed to have a relatively normal life prior to being pulled out of school in 2002 at the age of 17. What the heck happened?

\-Did Lacey actually suffer from the diagnoses her parents and media claims? I haven't found any reliable testimony from medical professionals that treated her.

\-The 2am 911 call makes no sense. You're telling me Lacey was living on the couch for 12 years, and then her mother just happened to notice she was dead at 2 in the morning, 24-48 hours after she had died? I just don't buy it. Why would the mother be checking on her daughter at such an odd hour of the night? If Lacey had been dead for so long before the 911 call, why wouldn't they have called earlier? Did they not know their daughter was dead during the daylight hours, yet realized it at 2am when she should have been asleep?

\-What was going on with Lacey mentally? Like I said earlier, none of her reported mental health diagnoses have been verified by a medical professional, but obviously mentally healthy people generally aren't found dead on a couch covered in their own feces. What was going on with her mentally?

There's a lot to consider with this case. I wish this write up could include a theory that I could confidently stand behind, but to tell you the truth the more I learn the more baffled I become. I'd love to get some of the community's thoughts.

There are plenty of things we can see: trees, stars, mountains, oceans, people, penguins, our best friend's smile, elephants, skyscrapers, coffee beans, sunsets, and tulips—to name a few.

God created all those things. He made the natural world, as well as the laws that govern it. 

But there are also things we cannot see: behind the breath of the wind, beyond the depths of the universe, beneath the foundations of love. Through Christ, all things were created—in heaven and on earth, both visible and invisible (Colossians 1:16).

And while our mortal eyes might not be able to see the wind or infrared light or the Spirit of God, we still experience their effects. Because there’s more than what meets the eye. There’s more beyond this life. 

There's more.

Paul’s friends, the Corinthians, were experiencing great hardship. They were being hunted and persecuted because of what they believed about Jesus—that He was the long-awaited Messiah. Some were even facing death. But Paul encouraged them to endure such fleeting trials with a hope that’s beyond this world. He wrote:

“So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.”
‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭4‬:‭18‬ ‭NIV‬‬‬‬‬‬‬

Human eyes can only see so much. Human minds can only grasp so much. But we can trust God with all that we cannot see or comprehend.

God is real. We might not be able to see Him today, with our physical eyes, but we can experience the effects of His life. Jesus sacrificed Himself so that you might live, and an abundant life awaits you—both on earth and in heaven. There is more beyond the here and now. 

So, will you fix your eyes on what’s seen or unseen? Will you trust your five senses, or have the sense to trust in Him?",2,1761705325.0,god,0,1.0,False

For me, the real frugality is about spending smart and bringing the most value in the long run, whether that means saving time, energy, or future expenses. Not sure if anyone else feels this way, but this year I’ve been trying to move from ‘buying what’s cheap’ to ‘buying what’s right’.

I live in a small apartment. This year, I bought a large monitor. Studying feels way more efficient, I can look up info and write reports at the same time without switching windows, which keeps me focused. I also got a simple capsule coffee machine. As a coffee lover, it’s probably the quickest investment to pay off. I usually have breakfast at home, and I’m not too picky about coffee, so it saves money and fills the place with that nice morning coffee smell. Lastly, I bought a mini robot vacuum from ecovacs. It’s small but does everything I need, reaches dusty corners, and even helps with my allergies, counts as a little health investment too.  

Since buying these things this year, I haven’t had any big splurges, and I hope to keep it that way. The idea behind them is the same, make some upfront investments to save more in the long run, anyone follow the same way?

1oistzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1oistzn/i_realised_that_everyone_in_our_hometown_thinks/,"I realised that everyone in our hometown thinks my boyfriend is ""weird"" and now i cant stop judging everything he does","I 22F have been with my bf 22F (let's call him R) for 3 years since we went to college. For context: we became super close during covid and spent the next and final year of highschool practically inseparable. We both went to college in different countries and begun dating after a month or two. We had a rough phase the first two years because he would flat out ignore me for 12 hours straight (we had a 8 hours time diference), give me a vague excuse like ""i was sick"" or ""i was doing an assignment"" and I would argue with him to get a proper answer, after which he would apologise sweetly and be give me attention for a couple days till it wore off, but the cycle kept on repeating. I stayed with him (unhappily) because i used to feel like he would change after i told him how his actions made me feel, and also i couldnt handle breaking up just because he used to forget i existed lmao. After i had enough, I had to tell him in bold letters (coz he didn't get it any of the previous times) that this was the final straw and I guess it worked because he changed and became exactly the version of the guy I fell for and he continues to be so since over a year and we are very happy. 

He even told his parents about me and made efforts to do things for me that i couldn't even think he would do. FYI, my parents are strict and dont approve of me dating this ""young"" so the fact that he told his parents about me meant a great deal to me.

This summer we both were in our hometown and I caught up with some old friends from school that I hadn't spoken to for years. When my friend asked me if I had a boyfriend, I said ""oh yeah do you remember R from school?"" and she turned to look at me with a HORRIFIED look on her face and said ""oh my god. What!"". I was so confused and asked her why she reacted that way, she said she just didnt expect me to date him (if it gives context, i was a popular-ish nerd who never dated anyone in school). Then her girl besties came over to meet me and the topic of boyfriends came up and when I said im dating R, one of the girls said, with a disgusted look on her face ""omg ew I hope you aren't talking about R from our grade"" and I literally felt my heart sink. I started questioning why they felt that way because he genuinely is nice to me, and they started citing incidents that made he realise he was, i guess you could say, the ""weird"" guy of our grade.

What they said made me realise that before we even started talking to each other, he had a reputation of doing rather  eccentric things. Like he would say very out of pocket things or make extremely bad cringey jokes hoping that someone would laugh, talking to people in a creepy voice to get a reaction, and fucking up simple tasks on purpose for the onlookers to laugh (eg. dropping a book he was reading out loud for the professor or misspelling easy words on the chalkboard). But these actions didnt get him a nice reputation, it was kind of the opposite. He was part of the cool people group back in school but I remember hearing on multiple occasions, directly and indirectly too, that they justtt tolerate him and i even remember hearing one of them say how they hated sitting next to him in school because he wouldn't shower before school and would stink of sweat. He also had gotten into a few fights with people because he used to spread things that people told him in confidence.

But the thing is, he is completely chill with me, there is no hint of any of the things he would do in the past with me. In fact I had completely forgotten that he used to be like that until my schoolmates reminded me this summer. Later, I spoke to him about it, and his feelings were hurt by how my friends reacted to the news of us dating (very valid reaction) and when I asked him about the way he used to act in the past, he said he ""used to put on a mask"" and dodged my questions and wouldnt give me a direct answer. It made me wonder whether the older verion was the real him or is his current version the real him, given our history of how he used to behave in the start of our relationship vs how instantaneously he switched up to be nice with me now since I threatened to breakup and block him.

A week after that, one of my friends from the ""cool people"" group was in town and im on good terms with her so I went to get coffee with her. She mentioned that I should call R over to meet, and when he showed up, she said on 4 different occasions that its not because she personally wanted to meet him (in the past, she had made it very clear that she doesnt like him) but because her other friends in cool group ""can't imagine"" how R interacts with me because we are a couple, and she later said that they had even asked her to click photos of the three of us together so they could see what we look like as a couple. R and I were weirded out and it was very clear that she just wanted gossip on how we behave as a couple to tell her friends about. 

I do love him very much and I want to spend the rest of my life together but I really can't shake everyone's reaction toward us. Its getting in my head and now im starting to judge things he does and the way he handles things. For better context, he is an only child and his mom is beyond obsessed with him, so I notice a lot of his habits and behaviour that nobody bothered to teach or correct while he was growing up. 

For example: he goes to class without brushing (idk why, he just says its not something that was forced on him to do as a kid) and he desperately needs braces (as said by multiple dentists) but never gets them as theyre ""expensive"" and his mom says his teeth are fine the way they are. He never styles his hair because he wasnt taught that he needs to groom himself unless its a very special occasion and has a ton of dandruff but doesnt listen to any of my remedies because his mom told him to use this shampoo (that didnt work on him). He doesnt take medicines even unless he is extremely sick because his mom isnt on board with using ""heavy drugs"" frequently and thats also why he even doesnt know which meds to take for a fever. He doesnt interact with his classmates or roommates and doesnt have any friends in his city, he just plays video games with his squad (or team whatever, idk the gaming lingo lmao) and talks to me and his parents. 

I get that im judging him in a harsh way, but honestly I cannot say whether im realising the truth or whether its just the people's reactions that have gotten into my head. Im scared I will continue to think of him this way and I dont want to create a permanently negative image of him in my head that I cannot be happy with. If the way I am thinking about him doesnt change soon, I can already tell that the relationship will end and I dont want it to because he understands me and is nice to me, but on the other hand I dont want people from our hometown, to think ""omg she married HIM?!"" and get judged for loving him. In a selfish way, i dont want to feel embarrassed for choosing him. I also understand that even if that was the way he really was before he met me, or if it was an act (i cannot say coz he refused to give me a direct answer), irregardless of how nice he is to me, other people will only think of the old version of him from school. I know I should care less of what people think and all, but the fact that basically everyone from our school thinks that is bugging me out.

I really dont know what to do, id appreciate any suggestions.

TlDR: have been long distance with my bf since we started college, met school friends and they said things that made me realise/remember that he was ""weird"" during school, but he isn't like that with me anymore and since then i am negatively judging the things he does and idk what to do.

1oisniz,https://i.redd.it/do49qf4emyxf1.jpeg,The Million-Dollar Divorce,"Chapter 1
I'd been working myself to the bone at work for a whole month, so my boss finally gave me a special seven-day break.
When I got home, I told my husband to pack quickly so our whole family could go on a trip.
But he didn't even look up.
""A trip? Seriously?""
""Our son's tuition and tutoring fees for next semester are over twenty thousand, and we still don't have enough.""
The smile on my face froze instantly, and I quickly asked,
""Didn't you tell me last month that we had 1.3 million saved in our bank account?""
""How can we not have money for tuition?""
Only then did Ethan Miller slowly raise his head, his tone flat.
""Oh, Olivia Clark is getting married during the holiday. That money was our wedding gift money for her.""
I stood there, unable to process what he'd said for a long time.
Olivia was Ethan's childhood sweetheart.
Even if they grew up together, but who gives that much as a wedding gift?
Seeing I was silent, Ethan got up from the sofa, sounding impatient.
""Sophia Willions, what are you standing there for?""
""There are leftovers from yesterday in the kitchen. Eat up, and then get back to delivering food. Our son said he wants a strawberry cake tomorrow, you can't just let him watch other kids eat it, can you?""
As soon as he finished speaking, our son Leo Miller ran out of his room, tugging on my sleeve and mimicking his dad's tone.
""Sophia, go make money!""
""I want the biggest strawberry cake!""
That ""Sophia"" made my heart tremble.
He used to always cling to me and call me ""Mommy."" When did he start ordering me around like Ethan does?
I tried hard to suppress the rage boiling inside me.
""Honey, tell me you're joking. Did you really take all our savings and lend it to your childhood sweetheart?""
Even then, I was still holding onto a sliver of hope.
Ethan hadn't discussed it with me beforehand, so he couldn't have just given such a huge sum of money to the lazy Olivia for her wedding.
But Ethan acted like he'd heard a joke, picked up a glass of water from the coffee table, took a sip, and then said slowly,
""What do you mean, lend?""
""Sophia, are you deaf today?""
""I told you, that 1.3 million was wedding gift money for Olivia. I never planned on asking for it back. We're all good friends, and come on, with your salary of over forty thousand a month, you can't be unwilling to part with this little bit of money, can you?""
If Ethan had discussed it with me beforehand, giving twenty or thirty thousand wouldn't have been out of the question.
But how could he just give away 1.3 million so casually without saying a word?
I shot up, my knee hitting the coffee table, and I sucked in a sharp breath from the pain.
""This little bit of money?""
""Ethan, that's 1.3 million!""
""That's five years of my blood and sweat, from working overtime until 3 a.m. every day, from drinking with clients until my stomach bled!""
""Olivia is an outsider. Do you think it's appropriate for her to take so much money from you for her wedding?""
Ethan snorted.
""What's not appropriate about it?""
""I've always seen her as my own sister. Of course I have to help her when she's in trouble.""
""Besides, it wasn't Olivia's idea. If the groom's family hadn't demanded a fully paid-for house, why would she even look at a house worth over a million?""
I almost laughed out of anger.
His own sister?
More like his lover!
Ethan and I both came from a poor rural area.
When we first got married, my parents gave me their life savings, and it was only enough for the down payment on an 80-square-meter apartment.
Not long after we got married, Ethan got sick, quit his job, and became a stay-at-home husband.
The entire burden of our life fell on my shoulders alone.
I had to work at the design institute during the day and then work part-time as a food delivery driver at night.
After five years, we finally paid off most of the mortgage.
I had thought that in a few more years we could get a bigger house, so we'd all have more space.
But now, he took it all and gave it to his childhood sweetheart, Olivia.
Olivia graduated from community college three years ago and just plays video games at home all day, with Ethan secretly covering all her rent and utility bills.
I knew about it, but I didn't confront him for our child's sake.
I never thought he could say something so shameless.
I was so angry my voice started to tremble:
""If they don't have money, then don't get married!
Don't take our whole family's savings to fill Olivia's bottomless pit!""
Hearing that, Ethan shouted:
""Sophia!
You're heartless! I'm only like this because of you!""
The moment Ethan said that, my chest felt like it had been struck by a heavy hammer, making it painful to even breathe.
In a daze, I was transported back to that rainy morning six years ago.
Chapter 2
When the nurse handed me the organ donation consent form to sign, I clung to a last shred of hope and asked:
""Is he really the only one who can donate?""
At that time, Olivia had a sudden illness and urgently needed a kidney transplant.
When Ethan found out, he immediately grabbed me and we rushed to the hospital in a taxi.
But on the way, there was a car accident. He was pierced by a piece of metal while protecting me.
Before he lost consciousness, he held my hand:
""Olivia is still young. You have to donate my kidney to her.""
I saw the stubbornness in his eyes, my heart ached so much I couldn't speak, and I could only sign the consent form with red eyes.
When the operating room light went out, the doctor wheeled him out, his face pale.
My heart ached and I couldn't stop crying. I took care of him in the hospital for a full three months until he recovered.
Later, a friend at the hospital secretly told me that there were two other volunteers who were also a match at the time.
It was Ethan's mom who tearfully persuaded Ethan:
""Back then, Olivia's parents died saving your father. You have two kidneys, it's fine to give one to her. Just think of it as repaying her father's kindness.""
When I found out, Ethan was still at home recovering.
Looking at his pale face back then, I couldn't bring myself to say anything accusatory.
I just felt that in that family, he had it harder than anyone.
So later, when he developed complications from the kidney donation and couldn't keep working and wanted to quit, I agreed without a second thought.
Every month when I got paid, I gave every single cent to him.
I thought about how much he had suffered before, and that now, even if I had to work a little harder, I had to make our family's life more comfortable.
I stared at him, my throat tight, and it took me a long time to force out a sentence:
""I never blamed you for donating your kidney to Olivia back then, because I knew how difficult your situation was at home. But now, how can you blame me for it?""
Ethan's eyes turned red too:
""If I hadn't protected you during the car crash, how would I have ended up with all these health problems after donating a kidney?""
Now I can't even work and can only stay home to recover. Who else is there to blame but you?
!
""Today I just asked you to go work as a food delivery driver after eating, and you throw such a huge tantrum. Olivia was right, you've looked down on me from the very beginning!""
I don't know how Ethan connected these two things.
I had no choice but to explain patiently:
""I'm not angry that you want me to go out and earn money. I'm angry that you took all our savings and gave them to Olivia without my permission. The 8,000 mortgage payment is due soon, and Leo needs 20,000 for tuition. Where do you expect me to get that much money all of a sudden?""
Hearing my words, Ethan's voice suddenly rose:
""So you're still blaming me for not working, for not being able to provide for this family like a man?""
""Sophia, the people who gave me love letters back then could have lined a whole street. If I had known you were like this, I never should have proposed to you!""
Seeing his dad cry, Leo charged at me, waving his little fists, and even reached out to scratch my face.
""Bad woman!
You're bullying Daddy, I'll kill you!""
Even though kids say things without meaning them, my son's words still stung me.
I reached out, pulled him in front of me, and said in a serious tone:
""Leo, Mommy isn't bullying Daddy. Who taught you to talk to Mommy like that?""
But he ducked his head and bit down hard on my wrist, his teeth sinking painfully into my flesh.
I endured the pain and didn't let go, but he stiffened his neck and shouted:
""Olivia said it! She said a useless woman like you doesn't deserve a husband and kids. I'm going to get Olivia to come kill you!""
To hear such words from the son I had doted on his entire life, my heart felt like it was being stabbed.
I don't know when he had become so defiant and bossy.
I choked back a sob and pulled him toward his room:
""Come back to the room with Mommy, and we can talk this out...""
Bang!
A sharp pain exploded at the back of my head, and I felt a warm liquid run down behind my ear.
I turned around and saw Ethan still clutching the broken half of a teacup.
Porcelain shards were scattered on the floor, and a large stain of tea and blood was spreading across the back of my shirt.
His eyes were bloodshot as he roared:
""Sophia, Leo is your own son!
Are you really going to hit him just because he said a few nice things about Olivia?!
Chapter 3
I clutched the back of my head, the pain making my vision go black.
Looking at the frantic man in front of me, and my son hiding behind him, his eyes filled with fear and disgust.
Suddenly, I felt tired.
Ethan didn't even glance at me, pulling Leo in front of him:
“Leo, tell your mom that you were okay with Aunt Olivia taking that money.”
My son stared at my bleeding head and suddenly giggled:
“Aunt Olivia said that when she has a baby brother, she'll take me to the amusement park and buy me the biggest Transformer. I'm willing to give her all our family's money!”
In that moment, I felt nothing but bitterness.
I used to think Ethan was only protecting Olivia because his mom guilt-tripped him about some debt of gratitude.
But now, I realized this was entirely his own willing choice.
I was so busy earning money to pay off debts that I neglected my son's upbringing, and now he's turned into a second Ethan.
I casually grabbed a few tissues and pressed them to the wound, crouching down to look into Leo's eyes, my voice holding a final shred of hope:
“Leo, Mommy really did neglect you before, but when you do something wrong, you have to apologize. What should you say to Mommy now?”
I waited for a “Mommy, I'm sorry,” but what I got was a cold snort from him:
“Serves you right!
Who told you to try and hit me!”
Those words were like a bucket of ice water poured over me, leaving me cold to the bone.
I stood up, my gaze sweeping coldly over Ethan:
“Ethan, I'm giving you two choices.”
My voice was devoid of any warmth.
“Either you go get back every single cent of that one million three hundred thousand right now,
or I go to court tomorrow and file for divorce,
and you'll still have to pay that money back then.”
Ethan's face instantly turned pale.
A flash of panic crossed his eyes, but he quickly replaced it with a 'what-can-you-do-about-it' look:
“Sophia, how could you be like this?
I'm the man of the house. How can I ask for a gift back once it's been given?”
“Let me tell you, you owe me for life. Don't you dare threaten me with divorce!”
I didn't waste any more words on him and stormed out, slamming the door.
The moment the door shut, it blocked out Ethan's angry curses and Leo's racket from behind me.
I just felt a wave of exhaustion.
These five years of marriage have drained all my energy.
After getting my wound treated at the hospital, I drove back to my neighborhood, only to have my way blocked by a group of people.
Olivia was there with a few young thugs with brightly colored hair, blocking my car,
She was holding a megaphone, banging hard on my car window while shouting to the surrounding neighbors:
“Everyone, come and see! This is a female love rat!”
“My friend protected her in a car accident, and now he's too weak to even work. And what does she do? She forced my friend to have a child with her, and now that my nephew is in kindergarten, she wants to kick my friend to the curb! This is the only child my friend will ever have!”
“Not only does she want a divorce, she's forcing my friend to pay her 1.3 million!
You tell me, is there any justice in this world?
Who bullies people like this?”
Ethan was also standing nearby, crying his eyes out:
“Honey, I'm begging you, don't divorce me. Don't take my son away.”
""You're asking a house husband like me to pay 1.3 million? You might as well kill me!
As long as you don't divorce me, I'll be your slave, I'll do anything...""
Their blatant lies instantly enraged the onlookers.
Someone pointed at my car and started cursing, another spat on it, and a flood of ugly words washed over me:
""This woman is just awful, isn't she?
She used her husband to have kids, and now she's trying to extort money from him. She has no shame!""
""Yeah, let's get a good look at her face. If she ever tries to date again, we can't make another poor guy fall into her trap!""
""Right, take her picture and post it online. Let her colleagues and friends see what she's like. Scum like her should be fired!""
...
Olivia stood in the middle of the crowd, looking at me smugly.
What she didn't know was that I had already taken a long leave of absence from work back at the hospital.
But just wanting a divorce wasn't going to be that easy. I needed to add more fuel to the fire.
I pushed the car door open, got out, and smiled at her.
""Olivia, you're about to get married. Why would I cause trouble for you at a time like this?""
The chatter from the crowd died down a bit. Olivia was stunned for a moment, clearly not expecting this reaction from me.
I took out the bank statements.
""As for the 1.3 million in compensation, why don't we take a look together and see where that money actually went?""

My partner and I just wrapped up our weekend of wedding events in California, and I wanted to share our learnings from 14 months of planning and what turned out to be an absolutely bangin' weekend of events. In this post are ""About Us"", ""Getting Started"", an overview of the weekend in ""What We Did & How It Went"", and finally two sections of ""Takeaways."" Ask us anything!

# About Us

We are a man and woman (but on the queer side and do not consider ourselves a heterosexual couple) who like to tell our own story and love a good party. We have some differences in opinion about what makes a good party, but we've both always wanted to throw something that looked something like a wedding. We have good relationships with our families (who offered significant help) but didn't want to get overrun by traditions or directions for this event that didn't feel like ""us."" Oh, and we're obsessed with each other!!

# Getting Started

A couple who had just gotten married gave us a book, a [Practical Wedding](https://apracticalwedding.com/), and we started by going through the first few chapters of that. We then went to a coffee shop together and did a 6-ish-part exercise (modified from a Practical Wedding). This was like 14 months ago so I don't quite remember, but I think took about 90 minutes total.

1. \[Alone\] Write about big crazy dreams for this event, un-gated by cost or logistics (5 min)
2. \[Alone\] Write how we want to feel during the event (5 min)
3. Share the above, and write out some themes. (5 min)
4. Create a mission statement (10 min)
5. Write a giant list of all things that need to be done for a wedding (or get one off of the internet). Circle ones that you personally care about. Cross off any you actively want not to be done. Identify the rest and plan to delegate them. (10 min)
6. Write a list of non-negotiables. (10 min)

Our mission statement ended up ""Go big or go home."" We wanted something that people would talk about in any breath about standout weddings they'd been to for the next 20 years. We also wanted a full-convention-weekend feel where people would make new friends and community. Having this vision and mission statement at the beginning was massively helpful for the rest of the planning, and always helped us make decisions that we got paralyzed on (eg. how many of my parents friends to invite).

# What We Did & How It Went

**Wednesday**: 

   * **What (8ppl)**: 
      * Lunch at my mom's
      * Bachelor party in our home with hand-made pasta. My partner and I decided that Batchelor/Bachelorette parties are normally ""stuff I won't be able to do anymore now that I'm married,"" but we decided that instead it should be ""things we're committing to continue doing even though our partner doesn't really enjoy it."" 
   * **How did it go:** 
      * **Lunch @ Mom's: B.** Hosting is how my mom shows affection and respect, and how she shows off so it was important to do something at her house. I picked my partner's family up at the airport and went straight to my mom's house for lunch. My mom may have been anxious, and so the lunch she put on ended up feeling extremely formal with like...the china from her and my dad's wedding, and 6 pieces of silverware each and a bowl of ice with tongs in it. There was a whole conversation about where people were going to sit and I at some point said, ""heh we're not formal, just neurotic!"" The food was great and it was good to get the families together early.
      * **Batchelor Party: B**. The point of this event was that the other partner doesn't like fussy food and dinner parties so this was intended to be a beautiful commitment to continuing to have fussy food. This was too fussy. The person being honored really didn't want to ask guests to shell out $150 for a dinner out, but in retrospect would probably do something that prioritized quality time with out of town guests over hard-to-delegate food prep. This sounds weird, but a nice thing that happened was we ended up promoting a friend who came to the this party to the wedding party in the middle and that felt very good to everyone involved. (We didn't have special outfits for wedding party so it was fine). 

**Thursday**: 

* **What:** Rehearsal & rehearsal dinner. 
* **How did it go:** 
   * **Rehearsal (10ppl): B+.** Rehearsal was successful, but attendance was weird due to it being in the middle of a weekday (due to the venue's constraints). We thought we had done this, but we should have communicated a little clearly which people we were asking to take time off and get yes/no from them earlier to plan around it. The venue also had more stuff they wanted to go through than I thought, so our agenda was a little longer than fit comfortably in our allotted time there.
   * **Rehearsal Dinner (19ppl): B.** The dinner was fine? Like kind of awkward? We had a welcome from my partner's mom and about 4 toasts, which were extremely nice and the food was great. We're still trying to figure out how to have fixed the awkwardness. We picked a restaurant that's actually famous for its cocktails, but we as a couple only go there for the food (and go there a lot) so we weren't really thinking about the cocktails when we booked it. People all ended up ordering fancy-ass beautiful cocktails and that was a focal point, which was stressful because a few of our party are carefully avoiding alcohol. The room we were in also happened to have a karaoke setup, which we love, but weren't intending to do the karaoke. A friend assumed we had picked the room for karaoke (since we are known in our friend group for karaoke) and started karaoke, but it was a weird group and weird size of group for karaoke. My partners' parents also were paying for it, but had (very thoughtfully) recused themselves from the planning to avoid imposing their vision -- they and we ended up feeling indecisive about who should welcome people etc? Not contentious, but a little awkward? Very pleasant evening but a little stressful.

**Friday**:

* **What**: 
   * Out of towners hike
   * A casual out-of-towners-focused-but-everyone-invited mini golf & food trucks! 
* **How did it go?** 
   * **Hike (8-12ppl)**: **A+**. This was great. See my takeaways section below, but we carefully got our to-do list done before this week and had a free day to hang out with people we hadn't seen in 15 years. My partner had created a scavenger hunt and some folks were going nuts with it! We posted on our event Slack about this hike, and people self selected down to an urban wander and lunch with 8-10 cool people. 
   * **Food Trucks & Mini golf (80ppl)**: **A+**. We were hemming and hawing about letting people pay for their own dinners, but a flock of family members and godparents came out of the woodwork to fund this event, which was extremely touching. We created some icebreakers for people to talk about and made sure everyone knew that our guests  meeting new people was important to us. There was a photo booth and people had some fun with it! Nobody was manning the photo booth-- might have been more popular if we'd assigned manning the photo booth to a cousin or something.

**Saturday**:

* **What**: Getting ready, pictures, main event, and afterparty.
* **How did it go?**
   * **Getting Ready (5-25 ppl buzzing around):** **A-**. Getting ready was a lovely experience. A friend brought a bunch of middle eastern food for everybody helping and buzzing around. It was great. We hired one person for hair and makeup but had offered hair and makeup to other people and 4 people ended up getting hair and makeup done -- in retrospect, it would have been good to have had a second hair/makeup artist to parallelize hair and makeup. As it was, my friend ended up needing to be around at 10:30am to start makeup early, which was fine since hotel and venue were all within 50 feet of each other, but there may have been a better, more compact schedule. It was *extremely* nice for my party to be around while I was getting ready. I felt very loved, and they helped me make some decisions that my decision-fatigued brain was failing to do. And the bonus was that then everyone was on time to photos!
   * **Photos (\~15 party)**: **B-**. This was fine? Everyone was there on time because we told them what time about a thousand times and we'd asked the wedding party to be around for getting ready (for vibes and snacks/lunch). I was the latest since getting dressed ran a tiny bit long. We sort of did a bad job of sourcing and communicating where we wanted to do the staged photos (partly due to weather and partly due to the venue's indecision/complexity?), and selecting which staged photos to do with which groupings. We had originally tried to source a photographer that specifically knew that area really well, and doing that may have solved this problem, but we didn't, oh well. The partner in the 4"" heels wished that they had a different method of transport (eg some crocs or something) for parts of the photo wandering. But people at outdoor restaurants stood up and clapped for us which was pretty rad. Haven't seen the photos yet so can update if that changes my grade for this :-).
   * **Main Event (120 ppl): A++**. Guys, it went great. We laughed, we sobbed. Everyone sobbed. Everyone laughed. We went big. We looked amazing. Instead of a ceremony, we self-officiated with some comedy and music, and explained our vows and commitment our way. My partner and I spent 20 minutes backstage after the ceremony picking at our food and reading each other poems and looking at each other and sobbing with joy. The food was a million tiny bites on stations and people loved it. We had a dance party to a playlist that I had created (and ""tested"" in advance extensively alone in my room) and the dance floor was packed all night. *Way* more people knew the electric slide than I thought. My partner danced more than my partner thought they were going to. My grandma was there and we danced to her favorite song (and so did everyone else). My dad and my partner's mom collaborated to create a museum of us with our dating profiles and baby photos and stuff, which people enjoyed. Neither my partner nor I drank all night. We had 125 RSVPs by 1 month out. Shrank a little, added a few last-minute coworkers, then had 2 actual no-shows for a total of 120ish?
      * Did things go wrong? Yes. The venue did not put out as many food stations as we asked them to so there was a long, consolidated line for food (which we had explained 1000 times that we wanted multiple stations to avoid). Friends who were avoiding alcohol walked up to two different bars and couldn't a bar with soda, despite our telling the venue that that was crucial. We selected a giant donut instead of a cake because ""something always goes wrong with the cake"" (and also $13 instead of like $1000), and somehow they *still lost the donut* for about a half hour. The photographer delayed starting the toasts (and therefore dancing) for 20 minutes because he was eating (even though we had given him a different dinner break time). The caterers said 1000 times they would pack up the food for us but we ended up needing to pack up the food at the end of the party. BUT we had asked my friend to step into the role of the day-of coordinator, and she fucking slayed it -- besides being dead-competent and running things down all weekend, one of the most important jobs she performed was that she was annoyed about things going sideways so that we didn't have to be. I do not know how we will thank/repay her. We both had prepared for some intermittent disappointment or stress, but we both only felt excellent all day.
   * **Afterparty: A+.** It was nearby, it was cheap, it was fun. We did karaoke in a big room. People were great. We got booted when our time was up at 1:30am and sang the whole way home.

**Sunday:** 

* **What (80ppl):** Brunch and & out-of-towners way-station at our house
* **How Did It Go:**
   * **Brunch: A+.** I thought was going to sleep till 11am to get up in time for the noon brunch in our house, but woke up at 6:30am still bopping to Last Dance and feeling super high. Was able to take back all of the errands we'd delegated to friends and let them get ready a little slower. We spent a total of $105 on food and $175 on coffee, but we had a ton of leftover food from the main event and a friend brought a giant pot of fruit. People ate, people talked. My partner and I wore pajama suits. We sang happy birthday to some relatives. We periodically made airport-run announcements. We revealed the solution to a mystery puzzle icebreaker we'd run on Friday night and reminded people to post their photos in the place we asked them to post photos. It was *extremely nice.*
   * **Out of Towners Waystation: A+.** Our guests all mostly departed around 4pm, some leaving together to give rides to the airport or to do tourism with new friends (eg my aunts and my partner's aunts who had never met before). People deposited their luggage in our house and then were in and out all day, allowing us to have some nice, focused conversations with people from out of town as they were taking downtime in our living room. We were tired, but it was super nice. 

**Now**:

* Photos from guests are rolling in, and we're glad we requested them to be put somewhere central and private so that our guests can see! (Slack).
* We are overwhelmed with gratitude for the people who helped along the way and people who gave us generous gifts (despite our efforts to communicate that all we really wanted was to spend time with people, people were gut-punchingly generous). We are enthusiastically planning our next weekend around sourcing and writing thank-you notes.
* We have a meeting with the venue tomorrow which I am not looking forward to. I've been not focusing on it too much in this post but the venue ripped us off, eg billing us for things that we didn't ask for (or specifically asked them not to do). Doing my best not to spend time thinking about it.
* Eating leftover food, which I, as predicted, absolutely did not get a chance to eat during the party. It's pretty delish.

# Planning Takeaways:

1. **Gendered socialization had a high impact on this event, even though we tried to avoid it.** Even though we both defy many gender norms, weddings are a context where gender has a high impact. The AFAB person in this couple had done more thinking in advance about what she would like this party to be like vs the AMAB person because of expectations of them during upbringing. The AFAB person felt strongly that the house needed to be professionally (and expensively) cleaned before having people in the house on Sunday, whereas the AMAB person did not. Most importantly: we were doing a pretty nontraditional event, one part of which was obfuscating the legal commitment and not really calling it a ""wedding."" The AFAB person was asked/judged about this a fair bit by family (""if he's not willing to commit to you, should you be doing this?"", ""If it's not really a wedding, should we really come?""), and the AMAB person wasn't. The important takeaway was to acknowledge it and have conversations about how it was impacting each of us.
2. **Traditions can be used to access emotions that may be hard to access otherwise**. We are conditioned by media and society to have sentimental reactions to traditions. Example from a different event: I am a pacifist and initially disliked that the army and navy were present at my grandfather's funeral, but I ugly-cried so hard during the trumpet/salute/flag-passing in a way that I may not have been able to access otherwise, and was able to assign my own meaning to it. For this wedding event, we initially dismissed all tradition and wanted to re-invent everything, but our event became more powerful when we started figuring out how to tap into some traditions our way as shortcut for accessing emotion. There were also some traditions that snuck up on me. For example, I had thought that the first dance wasn't important to me, and it took me months to figure out that I was disappointed that my partner didn't want to do it. I ended up telling my partner that it was important to me and we found a version of it that worked for both of us.
3. **Venues want to do as little work as possible, so do any customization not through the venue.** Venues want to pump out events efficiently and do not specialize in customization. For every single little thing we wanted customization on, the venue acted as an expensive, inconvenient, and resentful middle man. They had initially billed themselves as ""a replacement for a wedding planner! We will do all this coordination for you if you book through us and it'll be cheaper since we know all the vendors!"" but I had to tell them everything about 8 times and they got more wrong/had to do more work than if I had just had relationships directly with the vendors. They up-charged everything for ""coordination"" (even though they only seemed to be making things worse). It can be hard to know what ""customization"" means until it's too late, but basically I'm talking about anything that isn't already in the venue's basic offerings, or anything you have to explain to them.
4. **It is much easier to have a productive discussion about what you do want than it is to have a conversation about what you don't want.** Both are important, but having a vision is crucial. This was an especially tricky dynamic when one of us had a ""do want"" and the other had a ""don't want"" but brought nothing to replace the idea or collaborate. This came up most often when one person had more experience with an element (eg. food) or had spent more time researching something than the other (eg. day-of schedules), or when one of us had a big unprocessed fear (eg. feeling left out of dancing). Spending the time to go back to basics, redo a brainstorm, hear each other's fears, and share experiences helped us with this. 
5. **Good weddings borrow; great weddings steal.** We had a ton of original elements in our event, but there were some really awesome things that we encountered at various friends' weddings in the last 2 years that we totally ripped off. It saved time, and the friends were flattered.
6. **Judge other people's weddings.** Okay sort of kidding, but planning a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing to do, and most people just don't have the experience to do it really well. Things go wrong at every wedding. Failure and contrast is how we learn, so we took notes and had discussions after each wedding we attended for the last two years (sometimes even with the couple if they were willing to share) to learn about both things that went wrong, and also things that other couples had done intentionally that we just didn't want for ours. The most helpful experience I got was riding shotgun as a groomsperson in my best friend's wedding 2 months before mine. His wedding was both super romantic and also rad, but living through the...uh...complexity that happened backstage was *extremely* helpful for my own event. Some key takeaways from various weddings were:
   1. Give people something to talk about so that they meet new people, otherwise they will stick with their cliques. Especially out of towners will probably want to make new friends (but will also benefit from tips and rides from locals)!
   2. Make sure everyone involved in the week-of operations has an easy way to contact each other, even if they haven't met before. Unexpected people emerge as helpful, so you will probably not know the full list of who will help in advance. 
   3. Venues (and dance floors) that are too big for your group will make your wedding feel unnecessarily small and potentially sad. Crowded = good for party vibes
   4. If your wedding ends by 10pm, consider having an after party and make sure people know about it. They will self-select. Ending everything at 10 can feel like ending when the party is just getting going and potentially a bummer, depending on you and your friends.
   5. Do everything you possibly can before the week of the events (to avoid, for example, dinner being late by 90 minutes while your whole wedding party and family sets up un-alphabetized place cards based on a tiny seating chart on exactly one person's phone)
   6. And on that note, have a central repository for all critical information! Do not end up with one potentially MIA person as the only person with the seating chart on their phone.
   7. The people closest to you will probably offer lots of help, but lots of types of help will send your favorite people away from you at key moments. Consider relying on the partners of your best friends for send-away errands so that your best friends (and dad or whatever) can be around you.
   8. If you want to wear your outfit again, make sure nobody gets cake on it.
   9. For us: absolutely no Ed Sheeran
7. **Wedding planners and day-of coordinators are worth it, even with a ""full-service"" venue.** We did not hire a wedding planner because I and my mom are both professional managers/project managers, and we knew my friend was going to be an amazingly competent day-of coordinator (and that she would enjoy doing it). I do not regret this, partly because I *love planning things.* We used Jira and had a GANT chart and weekly standups and that was part of the fun of the event for me and was a nice way to connect with my mom. BUT a wedding planner might have run interference on some of the most irritating/stressful/even hurtful venue interactions. A planner may have also potentially provided a framework to avoid my partner feeling managed by me (which was something that came to a head about 1 month before the event). Getting assigned things by your professional planner is less fraught than by your emergent planner-partner (even with every effort for it to have been collaborative). We worked through this and my partner and I value opportunities to work through complexity and conflict, but another couple might prefer the buffer of a planner with each other or their parents.
8. **Take time to make sure both people feel ownership, and if that's hard, divide responsibilities, conquer, and show gratitude.** As alluded to above, there were moments (or months) during the planning when the sense of ownership over the party felt uneven. Not really from a labor standpoint, but more of a... ""if you're moving so fast, how do I catch up enough to have a relevant opinion"" standpoint. We ended up carving off chunks that felt good to own. For example, my partner started to feel antsy about starting to plan a honeymoon and I kept saying ""I can't think about that while we're planning this party."" We realized that my partner could own the honeymoon (with me as more consulted) and leave me to run with most parts of the party (with my partner consulted). Things felt much better after we figured that out.

# Week & Day Of Takeaways

1. **Don't get sick. Chug zinc and vitamin C. Wear a mask to work. Wear a mask in the shower. IDK, just don't get sick.** I thought we were being somewhat careful and then my partner told me on Monday they were having mild symptoms. With *so much regret* (and a tiny bit of anger), I read every reddit post about being sick at your wedding (all of which just unhelpfully say ""just don't get sick!"") and catastrophized about my partner killing my grandma with a cold or my grandma needing to not come or having to tell everyone that we were sick or not being able to do the musical part of our event or or or. Anyway my partner was not sick and I was not sick. But don't fucking get sick. We chugged zinc and vitamin C every day and slept as much as possible and did yoga to manage stress and dove out of meetings with sick coworkers and it was fine and nobody was sick.
2. **You will learn things about the people in your lives, and some of them may disappoint you. Try to let them impress you instead.** By 30 or whatever, many of us have a wheelhouse. You will probably ask somebody to show up in a way that they just can't or don't know how to, and they may disappoint you. Try to let people show you love in a way that is in their wheelhouse. My partner asked a friend to give a toast, and 2 days before the event the friend backed out. Meanwhile, I specifically did *not* ask my brother to give a toast (and was honoring him in a different way) because I didn't trust him not to disappoint me (based on something that happened during our engagement party). 2 days before the event my brother was like ""when is my toast!"" I was deeply annoyed at his presumption and we theoretically already had way too many toasts (6!!), but gave him the slot that my partner's friend had left open, and then my brother gave a super amazing and thoughtful toast. Still vaguely annoyed that he wasn't tuned in enough to understand that springing a toast on us unasked was offsides, but more touched that he put effort in and gave an amazing toast. Similarly, I had asked for a favorite aunt to help me with wardrobe months ago and I was pretty disappointed when she bailed, but then she came through in a whole bunch of other really touching ways (such as entertaining my partner's stressed-out aunts all weekend and putting them at ease -- upon reading through this post, my partner let me know that my aunt is all their family is talking about). **TLDR**; look for how people are coming through and try to brush it off and make other plans when something is out of their wheelhouse.
3. **People do NOT understand what goes into planning a wedding until they have had one and may be confusingly unhelpful.** Several of our guests threw us strange/ complicated /tone deaf requests in days leading up to the event. A friend of mine asked to borrow my big air filter to help them not get covid and asked me to deliver it to the hotel at a certain time and kept asking for other options when I kept saying no. It felt bad to say no since this friend was flying across the country to see me, but it was very important to draw a boundary and not, like, leave my rehearsal dinner early to bring an air filter across town to the hotel for them. My brother asked if we could step away from the out of towners event for 30 minutes to redo part of the rehearsal because he chose not to take time off of work for the rehearsal. Also no. Be prepared for weird requests, but be equally prepared for people (many of whom have had weddings) to do alarmingly thoughtful things to help.
4. **Be completely done with your to-do list by the Sunday before the event(s).** Our main event was on the 25th of October and we had those lunches and dinners and things starting on Wednesday the 22nd. We finished our to-do list on Sunday the 19th and it was glorious. We then got a dozen curve balls from the venue and various guests all week, and the fact that we were done with everything else made the curve balls kind of goofy and entertaining instead of deeply stressful. We took Friday off and had all of Friday free to spend a wonderful day with our out of town guests! I may have answered a couple of texts and emails, but was free to enjoy myself! 
5. **Having a comfortable outfit is not necessarily a compromise.** One person in our relationship had a pair of 4 inch heels and also got a backup pair of sparkly loafers (both pairs retail for over $1000 new but we got them used from the RealReal for like $150 each!!) with extreme padding inserts in them and changed mid-event. When it came down to it, we actually thought the sparkly loafers looked better.
6. **Label everything as if your very sweet but least competent uncle will end up being the person to pick up that box and need to know what to do with it.** I knew this coming out of somebody else's wedding and *still* didn't quite nail it. We had some pins that we wanted to be passed out at a certain point, and the box (which was labeled with where it *goes* and what it *was* but not what to do with it and and when) made it to where it was supposed to go, but then nobody did the thing with it. Whoops.
7. **Plan to have disappointing moments, and be** ***way too busy*** **to not be overwhelmed with good moments.**

# Conclusion

We were so overjoyed by this event. Almost everything went like 25% better than we ambitious folks dared to hope it would go. We have both randomly cried with joy multiple times since then about how well it went. People told us it was the best wedding they'd ever been to. A gay couple told us it was the ""queer wedding of the decade"" (which is especially funny since *they threw themselves two weddings this decade*). Our relationships with each other, or friends, and our families are closer than ever. We kept joking ""good thing this is the last time we do this!"" since it was so much work and money and we expected to crash so hard, but dang if I wouldn't just do the whole thing again next weekend. Let's goooooooo.

Anyway, let us live through you! We are very happy to share other learnings. Go plan a sick wedding, and we're happy to answer any questions about ours.",1,1761703707.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

I’ve been married to Colonel Cole Harrison for a year.


We've only had sex twice.


The first time was our wedding night.


He complained I was too tight, I said he was too big.


We spent the entire night trying to shove him into me. Nobody came.


The second time came six months later, when Cole finally got a week of leave.


Maybe he'd been pent up too long. Or he'd gotten advice from his buddies. The man was an animal in bed.


After I blacked out for the fifth time, he woke me up again, thrusting into me.


""Please,"" I whimpered, my voice completely wrecked. ""I can't... I can't take anymore.""


His warm lips brushed against my ear, never stopping his rhythm. ""Call me hubby and I'll stop.""


Heat flooded my cheeks as I whispered breathlessly, ""Hubby...""


His eyes went feral as he lifted me on top of him.


A sexually starved military man is a terrifying thing.


For seven straight days, I couldn't get out of bed.


After he shipped back to base, I discovered I was pregnant.


That's when photos of him kissing his first love exploded across Tiktok.


So this bastard just went down on me and now he’s french-kissing some other girl???


I immediately sent divorce papers overnight to his unit.


Fuck off, asshole. Keep your lips for that bitch—I don't do leftovers.


.......


The day after I sent the divorce papers, Cole's mother showed up at my door.


The usually poised, elegant woman couldn't even meet my eyes, guilt written all over her face.


""Sage."" She took my hands, voice pleading. ""Cole really messed up. He wronged you.""


""But for the sake of our families' friendship, and the baby you're carrying... I'm begging you, sweetheart. Give him one last chance. Just seven days.""


""If that bastard still doesn't get his shit together, I'll sign off on the divorce myself.""


I touched my barely-there baby bump, my mind drifting back years ago.


I was with my parents on a peacekeeping mission when border conflicts erupted.


A group of militants, desperate for leverage, kidnapped several officers' children.


Cole and I were among them.


During those hellish days in captivity, Cole kept himself between me and danger, ""Don't be scared. I've got you.""


Even when the captors beat him bloody, he never let go of my hand.


After the rescue, lying weak on a stretcher, he still managed to hook his pinky with mine.


""We made a promise, remember? I'll always protect you.""


Maybe I was still clinging to that old promise. I agreed to give him seven days.


Shortly after Mrs. Harrison left, Cole came home.


He acted like his makeout session with his ex hadn't been trending on Tiktok for three straight days. No explanation, just casually chatting with me.


""Been slammed with tactical exercises. Haven't had time to check in.""


""You mentioned wanting to hit those hot springs, right? I booked us a place. Let's go tonight.""


I stayed quiet for a long moment before finally saying, ""Okay.""


Those three days were eerily peaceful.


Cole took me sightseeing, walked with me, even brought me milk and massaged my feet.


His attentiveness almost made me forget everything—like we were newlyweds again.


On the last evening, we soaked in the hot springs together.


I wore a red bathrobe. The moment I settled into the water, he pulled me into his lap.


I tensed immediately. ""Cole, I'm pregnant.""


His lips brushed my ear, voice low and heated. ""I asked the medic. After three months, it's actually good for you to... relax.""


I didn't resist. Let him hold me.


Water lapped against the stone edge as Cole moved me up and down in the pool.


Three hours later, he finally led me out, satisfied, our fingers intertwined.


We passed through the lobby, I was taking in the lively scene when Cole suddenly froze.


I followed his gaze.


Outside the entrance stood Olivia Cruz, his first love.


She was in a sharp blazer, clearly just back from an assignment.


Her eyes were rimmed red, brimming with tears—like a wounded kitten.


The next second, Cole's hand slipped from mine.


He reflexively took half a step toward her, then stopped himself.


His broad shoulders went rigid.


Finally, he grabbed my hand again and strode out of the lobby.


He had chosen me, yet the air in the room felt so heavy I could barely breathe.


Cole stood by the window, smoking in silence.


I got up and headed for the door. ""I need some air.""


He didn’t look back, pretending not to hear me.


I sat in the lounge for a while until Olivia appeared, sliding into the seat across from me with a coffee in hand.


I started to leave, but she spoke first.


""Feeling pretty smug right now, Sage?""


I turned back. Her eyes were red, voice bitter.


""Had I not gone to the war zone for my reporting and stepped aside, you’d never have gotten close to Cole.""


A sharp pang hit my chest, but I kept my voice steady.


""And your point is?""


Her knuckles went white around her cup.


""You know he'd divorce you in a heartbeat if I asked him to, right?""


I looked at the obsession burning in her eyes and almost laughed.


""So what you're saying is... you're done being a war correspondent? Ready to be a homewrecker full-time?""


Olivia's face went pale. She leaned in, voice dropping. ""Why don't you ask Cole who the REAL homewrecker is?""


""The law decides who the homewrecker is.""


I gave her one last withering look and walked away.


Chapter 2


When I got back to the room, it was empty.


I frowned and called Cole. His ringtone echoed from the stairwell at the end of the hall.


I followed the sound.


Under the dim emergency lighting, Cole had Olivia wrapped gently in his arms.


He glanced at his phone screen—*Wifey* flashing—and hit decline without hesitation.


The next second, Olivia rose on her tiptoes and kissed him softly on the lips.


It felt like a bullet ripping through my chest.


I turned and walked back to the room, shutting the door behind me. The air felt thin, like I couldn't breathe.


Cole didn't come back until after midnight.


When he saw me sitting by the window, he frowned.


""Why are you still up? You're pregnant—shouldn't stay up late.""


I took a deep breath. ""Cole, let's go home.""


His expression hardened. ""Because of Olivia?""


""Yes."" I met his eyes. ""Is that a problem?""


He looked away, his tone softening slightly. ""The mountain roads are iced over at night. It's not safe to drive. I'll have my aide pick us up first thing in the morning.""


""I want to leave NOW.""


I stood my ground, watching the last flicker of hope inside me die out.


That pissed him off. He shot to his feet. ""Fine! We'll leave right now!""


He packed in angry silence, not looking at me once.


When we reached the resort entrance, a swarm of reporters had cornered Olivia.


Camera flashes lit up her pale face.


""Ms. Cruz, why were you alone with Colonel Harrison late at night?""


""There are rumors you're trying to wreck his marriage. Are you comfortable being the other woman?""


""What does the Army think about this? Will this affect the Colonel's career?""


The questions were brutal.


Olivia's eyes welled up with tears. She looked fragile, vulnerable.


Then Cole suddenly dropped his suitcase and charged into the crowd.


He pulled Olivia behind him, facing the cameras head-on, his voice sharp and commanding.


""Ms. Cruz is a war correspondent. We were discussing border coverage. Anyone who continues this harassment will be hearing from JAG.""


Amid the chaos, he ushered Olivia into his military Jeep and sped off.


I stood alone in the bitter cold—twenty degrees below zero—watching his taillights disappear around the mountain curve.


After a long moment, I let out a hollow laugh and turned around, walking away from the place that shattered my heart.


Seven days are up, Cole Harrison. We're done.


Chapter 3


""Colonel Harrison Caught Kissing War Correspondent on Snowy Night—Military Marriage in Crisis!""


Mrs. Harrison read the trending headline aloud, word by word.


She slammed her phone on the table with a thunderous crack.


""Cole, do you have any idea what you've done?!""


Cole stood at attention in the center of the living room, uniform crisp.


""I've contacted the Public Affairs Office. All related posts will be scrubbed in twenty minutes.""


""You think that's what I'm worried about?!"" Mrs. Harrison jabbed a finger toward me.


""Sage is pregnant, and you left her to drive back alone from hours away? What if something had happened to her—""


Cole's gaze finally landed on me. His throat bobbed.


I didn't acknowledge him. Just kept scrolling through my phone, numb.


Every word on news felt like a blade, slicing me apart slowly.


Then the screen glitched for a second and refreshed to a new trending topic:


*#Cole Harrison And Olivia Cruz 10Years At The Border*


I clicked. The first photo was of them years ago at a border checkpoint.


Olivia wore a helmet, beaming as she leaned into his shoulder. Cole's hand rested protectively on her back.


The intimacy and tenderness in that photo—it was something I'd never experienced in this marriage.


I suddenly felt like an idiot. Marrying him on impulse, thinking my feelings mattered.


Ignoring the argument still raging between mother and son, I went straight to the bedroom.


Cole didn't come in until after I'd showered.


I ignored him, toweling off my hair and turning on the military news channel.


Olivia Cruz's bright voice filled the room.


""...our soldiers sacrifice their youth guarding our borders. Their relationships deserve to be treated with sincerity.""


Cole reached for the remote. I gently blocked him.


""Ms. Cruz's reporting is pretty insightful.""


""The posts have been taken down,"" he said stiffly.


""And what about the source?"" I looked up at him.


""What are you going to do about Ms. Cruz?""


He avoided my eyes. ""She's being reassigned tomorrow. Off the military beat.""


""Just reassigned?"" I let out a cold laugh.


""Guess it's true what they say—the unloved one is always the real mistress.""


Cole's face darkened. ""Sage, enough.""


Seeing the irritation in his eyes made my chest tighten.


After a long pause, I finally said, ""Fine. Got it.""


At dawn, I had his aide drive me back to my parents' house.


""Mom, I want a divorce.""


My mother didn't look surprised. She sighed softly.


""A year ago, you insisted on marrying him. I told you he wasn't the right man. But if you've thought it through... I support you.""


The tension I'd been holding onto finally released.


Around noon, Cole showed up.


""Mrs. Sullivan, I brought you and the Colonel some tea and supplements. Thought I'd pick up Sage for the Officers' Spouses luncheon.""


He was all charm and politeness—the same face he wore for the media.


It made me sick.


The seven days weren't up yet. I'd keep my promise to his mother.


Before my mom could respond, I walked over to Cole. ""Let's go.""


We got in the car. Cole glanced at my expression and said quietly,


""This is your first time at a military function, right? I'll introduce you to some of the other officers' wives.""


I stayed silent.


After all this time married, this was the first time Cole was bringing me to a public event.


Pathetic, really.

1oisf5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1oisf5x/title_and_link_plz/,Title and link plz,"Husband moved his friend's pregnant widow in. I called Dad to cut funds and divorce.

Less than a month after the funeral, my marriage quietly began to crumble.
“My best friend is gone, and his wife is pregnant. She has no one to rely on.”
Ethan Lawford stood at the door with Clara Lewis beside him, his voice calm—too calm.
“She’ll stay here for a while. I promised Lewis I’d take care of her.”
He carried her luggage in himself, the same hands that used to hold me when he came home late from the firm.
Now they carried another woman’s life into our home.
At first, she was quiet. Fragile.
Then she began to fill the house with her presence.
She brought him coffee at midnight, murmuring, “You’ve been working too long, Ethan. You need rest.”
She lingered at the office doorway when he drafted case briefs, her eyes soft, full of grief and gratitude.
And every time, Ethan looked at her with that same patient sympathy—
the kind that used to belong to me.
I wasn’t naive.
I used to be a lawyer too. I recognized every emotional manipulation she deployed.
The evidence was all there—motives, opportunity, execution.
But what hurt most wasn’t her tactics.
It was that Ethan never once objected.
He gave her the guest room first. Then he gave up our bedroom.
And me? I became the stranger walking past two people who shared whispered grief behind closed doors.
Three years ago, I’d quit my position at my father’s investment firm to support Ethan’s career.
I funded his dream of opening his own law office.
Now, standing in the same home built from my father’s money, I watched him give it all away—to her.
I dialed a number with shaking hands.
“Dad,” I said, voice low but steady. “I want a divorce.”
There was a long silence. Then Charles Jameson’s voice came through—measured, dangerous.
“What did he do?”
I told him everything. The midnight visits, the cups of coffee, the shirt she wore, the sympathy he offered.
When I finished, my father said simply:
“Good. Do it. You don’t need permission. Remember—the Lawford firm exists because of my funding. I can pull it overnight.”
When I hung up, I felt an eerie calm.
As if disappointment had already prepared me for this ending.
The woman staring back at me in the mirror wasn’t the gentle wife who ironed Ethan’s shirts.
She was colder now. Sharper.
That night, I slept in the study.
The next morning, I walked into the kitchen—and stopped.
Clara stood at the counter wearing one of Ethan’s shirts, humming softly as she poured coffee.
It was my shirt. The one I bought him the day he won his first major case.
She turned, smiling lightly. “Good morning, Sarah. Didn’t sleep well? I heard you stayed in the study.”
I stared at that shirt, every word she said scraping against my patience.
“Take it off,” I said flatly.
Her smile faltered. “What?”
“I said take. It. Off.”
My voice carried the precision of a verdict.

He moved his pregnant sister-in-law into their bedroom—
until the FBI jacket started the war.
…………..

 husband's brother was an FBI agent, just like him. Half a month ago, he died in the line of duty.
Then my husband showed up at our door with his pregnant sister-in-law.
""My brother was killed in action during a mission. My sister-in-law is pregnant and needs someone to take care of her. As an FBI
agent, I must ensure the safety of a fallen hero's widow and child.""
Martin Sam spoke with calm, unquestionable authority, like he was delivering orders at an operation briefing. As he spoke, he carried June's luggage into the house and led her straight toward our master bedroom.
I stood there, watching him open the door for her, arrange the bedding, his movements natural, as if all of this was perfectly reasonable.

And I-could only watch coldly from the sidelines.
The first week, she was relatively quiet. The second week, she began to infiltrate.
She would stand softly at the study door:
""Martin, are you writing reports? You need some warm milk to relax your nerves.""
At dinner, she would suddenly clutch her chest, looking panicked: ""I feel like someone's watching me. Martin, could you help me check the security around here?""
In the middle of the night, she would call him into her room in distress, crying that she'd dreamed of someone breaking in, begging him to stay by her side.
When going out for walks, she needed Martin to stay close to her, or she wouldn't dare leave the house.
I'm no amateur—I used to be a seasoned
journalist.
I knew all too well how this kind of ""crisis""
was manufactured step by step. She carefully orchestrated everything, crafting herself into a ""helpless, constantly threatened"" victim.
The evidence was right before my eyes—one contrived coincidence after another, one
deliberate cry for help after another.
But when I looked at Martin, there wasn't a trace of suspicion in his eyes, only patience and protectiveness.
""You need a stable environment. Don't
overthink things.""

When he said this, his hand gently rested on June's shoulder, with a comforting pressure.
""If you're still worried, hold me tight, feel my warmth, don't worry.""
My heart clenched painfully.
How I wanted to remind him-I'm your wife, not her.
But the words stuck in my throat, leaving only the sound of my heart pounding wildly in my chest.
Three years ago, I quit my job as a journalist at The Washington Post for our marriage.
That was my stage, my former sharpness and edge, now dulled by marriage and domesticity.
I thought that by giving up interviews and pursuing truth, I could win his heart.

But now I understand—in his eyes, a woman wearing the identity of a ""widow"" is more worthy of protection than I am.
I walked into the study, my fingers ice-cold, and dialed the phone.
""Dad."" My voice trembled, yet was more resolute than ever. ""I want a divorce.""
• ••
On the other end of the line, my father was silent for a moment. As the head of a media
conglomerate, his voice was low and stern:
""Karen, don't be afraid. Whatever decision you make, I'll support you. The James family's resources aren't meant to enable other people's ridiculous charades.""
After hanging up, my heart was surprisingly calm.

Perhaps because the disappointment of
recent weeks had already worn me down
completely.
I looked at the woman in the mirror—
haggard, colorless, nothing like the journalist who once dared to confront politicians and corruption with a recorder in hand.
But from now on, I would change.
That night, I slept in the study.
In the morning, I walked into the kitchen.
June was already there.
She was wearing Martin's FBI jacket, the oversized letters ""FBI"" printed on her back,
as if silently declaring identity and belonging.
I knew that jacket all too well-every time
Martin returned from a mission, I would wash it.

Now it hung loosely on June's shoulders. She was humming, making coffee.
When she saw me, she smiled slightly, as if nothing had happened.
""Good morning, Karen. I heard you slept alone in the study last night?""
I stared at that jacket, a dull pain in my chest.
My voice was cold, without inflection:
""Take it off.""
Her smile froze.
""What….. what?""
""I said-take off the jacket.""

My tone was like throwing the sharpest question at a press conference-calm, cutting, with no room for evasion.
2
Chapter 2
Her eyes flickered, feigning innocence: ""I just threw it on casually... I thought it would be okay.""
Just then, Martin walked in.
Seeing June frantically unbuttoning the jacket, his face immediately darkened.
""Karen! What are you doing? Can't you see she's pregnant? She's already under enough stress!""
I laughed coldly: ""Of course I can see that.

But I also see her wearing your most symbolic uniform jacket, putting on an act in my kitchen. She's not seeking comfort-she's declaring her position.""
""It's just a jacket!"" Martin stepped forward, gripping my arm, trying to calm my emotions.
""Can't you be rational? June is a hero's widow. She lost her husband. Can't you have
some compassion for her?""
""Rational?"" I jerked away from him. ""Martin, you're not her husband. You guard her room at night, comfort her 'nightmares,' help her check for supposed threats... and you call that rational?""
The air suddenly became stifling.

June's eyes reddened, and she gently placed her hand on Martin's arm, her voice trembling: ""I'm sorry, it's all my fault. I shouldn't have caused you to fight...""
She lowered her head, tears welling up, like an innocent victim.
Martin immediately protected her, glaring at me over her shoulder: ""Look what you've
done—you've driven her to this!""
""I'm only doing this for my brother. She's his wife. My brother died in service, and I need to protect his wife and child."" His voice was ice-cold, like making a vow.
Ever since June stepped into our home, he'd used ""brother"" as a shield countless times.
As if hanging the name of ""duty"" on everything could make me accept all the absurdity.
My heart was comnletelv torn

Martin stared at me like he'd heard a
ridiculous joke, actually laughing: ""Divorce?
Stop being silly. What do you want? I can give you anything.""
June sobbed softly, saying quietly: ""Stop fighting, it's all my fault. I'll just leave...""
She stepped back, tears streaming, like a wounded deer.
Martin immediately reached out to stop her, his eyes panicked: ""Don't talk nonsense!
You're not going anywhere.""
I spoke coldly: ""If she won't leave, I will. The divorce papers will be delivered to you by my lawyer.""
Martin's face changed dramatically, his voice low: ""Karen! Calm down. You're destroying everything we have.”

""Destroying everything we have?"" | laughed coldly, my voice sharp as a blade. ""Martin, you destroyed it with your own hands.""
I turned and left, picking up my phone to dial a number.
""Elaine, I need divorce papers. The reason is simple: irreconcilable differences.""
On the other end, my lawyer friend was silent for a moment, then replied coldly:
""Understood. Don't worry, I'll prepare
everything.""",2,1761703045.0,novelsfree,4,1.0,False

I (32M) run a small little pop-up coffee shop out of my home garage here in TX every week. For context, l started doing this about 5 years ago and now I have the privilege of serving a long line of neighbors in my neighborhood and people who come to me all over the area.

I am a one man show and make specialty coffees and have set up a nice area to create community and like minded people to come, grab a cup of coffee and just relax on a Saturday.

Just to help explain a bit, once customers grab a coffee, they go to my backyard where I have tables, shading and a pool they can lounge at, I like to call this the main hangout space.

I have never ran into any issues and the people I serve have always been kind…that is until this last weekend.

It was an early morning and I had a long line waiting for my doors to open. Somewhere in the middle was 2 middle aged men. Both of them seemed normal and to themselves for the most part, that is until I heard a weird silence in the yard…which was uncommon.

After a while, a young lady approached who is a regular of mine. She comes to me weekly and always reads her books in my space for hours at a time. This time, she approached me with tears and said “these two men keep creeping around me and one won’t stop sitting next to me trying to talk to me”.

I told her to go back and I put out an away sign for 5 min to go observe the situation. Much as she said, these men were in fact bothering her. It was minimal as in not affecting the other customers but it was REALLY bothering her.

I went over, pulled the guy sitting out of his chair and told them they weren’t welcome here anymore. They both got pissed at me and told me I’d regret it but I feel like I did the right thing.

Should I have let her handle it since none of my other customers were bothered by it or was me making a scene the right thing to do?

I am currently working in a pharmacovigilance/drug safety and is a licensed pharmacist with over 8 years of experience among different pharmacy fields. Right now, what I'm earning is just enough for me and sometimes nakakapagbigay pa naman to family. However, we recently experienced a family emergency which damaged our finances and now we're on the verge of losing some of our properties na and my mom and dad might go back to renting after years of saving up to buy a house.

Also made account in OLJ but no bites so far. Abroad is definitely out of question because even if it's high reward, it is also high risk. I also have niche hobbies (coffee, gaming) but I have no idea how to monetize them and plus I don't think they can get me the funds I actually need.

We were both baptized as Catholics when we were teenagers but my wife wanted to be protastant , after doing a ton of research I couldn't get down with following a man made church. I told her id either go back to being Catholic or id give this other religion id never heard of , Orthodoxy a try. Well she did not want to be catholic , she said it always felt culty to her and always feels like shes being judged , and me being raised in a strict catholic family kind of agreed with her points. So we visited an Orthodox church , they ended up not having a full time priest , but the my first impression was how nice and warm and welcoming they were of my family and I , they did readings for an hour and that was about it I didnt get to really experience anything. I found another church thats a half hour away , but had a full time priest. We've gone 2 weeks in a row and love it again everyone was so warm and welcoming and friendly to us , Im covered in tattoos and piercings, and so is my wife , and we didnt feel judged at all it felt so familiar but different at the same time , absolutely love the Liturgy and the traditional aspect of it. At first I questioned if I was making the right decision or even picking the ""right"" religion to follow, my family is acting somewhat weird about it, we've gotten ""well we are catholic why not just find a nice catholic church to go to"" or ""your not Greek or middle eastern why would you want to be orthodox for? "" even thought we are French and not roman or Latin lol. But each week of going I know I am making the step in the right direction my wife , who was super skeptical about going to an Orthodox church ( she thought it was gonna be like catholic mass ) is excited to go to church every sunday now and has even been talking about wanting to stay for coffee after Liturgy this sunday, and has been talking about things like getting our daughter baptized ( which tells me shes really set on this whole thing and she was very very apprehensive about all of this she was never raised in a religious household at all or knows anything about religion ) I dont really know why im making this post but I just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart how thankful I am at the hospitality of the people of the orthodox faith and am really looking forward to where this takes my family in life as we make a significant change and turn a new page in our ever growing life.

After years a set of rules were put in place to keep the peace. The first rule is that quirks and Pokemon are forbidden from being used in the other worlds territory. Rule 2 is that pro heroes can not interfere with the law of the Pokemon world. Rule 3 only the champions and Pokemon rangers can bring Pokemon to the world of heroes in case of Pokemon being smuggled into the world of heroes. The final rule is that anyone who violates these laws will be arrested with a life sentence.

After years of abuse and neglect he decided to run away to the Pokemon world to be free. He thankfully was able to get away without problem and was ready for his new life in Kalos. What he didn't expect was to bump into professor Sycamore and his new assistant Mabel.

""Welcome to Kalos"" Sycamore said as he grabbed Izuku's hand and shook it vigorously confusing the boy.

""Um thank you but who are you two?"" Izuku asked.

""Forgive my boss when he heard someone from your world was coming here and wanted to meet you Izuku Yagi"" the blue haired woman said.

""Sorry it's just so rare for anyone to travel between worlds I got excited. I am Professor Sycamore and this is my assistant Mabel. I actually would like to offer you a starter Pokemon and ask that you travel the region"" Sycamore said.

""Why me?"" Izuku asked.

""The professor is curious on how mega evolution is effected by someone from your world"" Mabel explained.

""I guess I can try, I don't have a quirk"" with that the three made their way to the lab where a girl around Izuku's age was waiting.

Izuku wasn't sure what confused him more, the girl wearing a chest plate or her sword staring at him. As soon as she saw the professor she ran up to him, and punched him in the gut. Without thinking Izuku rushed forward and twisted the girls arm behind her before pinning her to the ground. Before the floating sword could move the professor spoke up.

""No need to worry Izuku this is Jeane she is here for her starter Pokemon"" Sycamore said.

""So does she just assault people as a greeting?"" Izuku asked.

""She spent years helping the professor so they are close, don't question it"" Mabel said as Izuku let her up.

""You will pay for this injustice you-"" before Jeane could finish Mabel dragged them inside.

""Alright you two pick your starter Pokemon"" Sycamore said as he sent out a Froakie, a Fennikin and a Chespin.

""I will take Chespin, as much as I would like to stay I promised my uncle and his girlfriend that I would meet them"" with that Jeane ran out with Chespin.

""Looks like your rival is already trying to get a head start"" Sycamore laughed as Izuku looked at the remaining Pokemon. After a second he noticed something, the Fennikin was rather small and seemed timid. Izuku gently began to pet the fire type and told the professor he would take Fennikin. With his starter selected he decided to take on the gym challenge.

Unbeknownst to Izuku a group in grey suits were watching the lab. Once he was gone one of them made a call.

""It's like you heard boss someone from the hero world is here, what are your orders?"" the figure asked.

""Keep close and when he is alone one of you grab him, whatever his power is will help us"" a female voice said.

""Yes ma'am"" with that the figure hung up.

Mabel watched Izuku leave and once he was out of sight she looked at the professor.

""Are you sure those two can bring out the same potential out of their Pokemon as that fabled Greninja?"" Mabel asked.

Sunny Side Up

(A High Desert Reaper Story)

The desert is a huge place.

People think it is just sand and cactus, but the 760 has more cities than you would expect. Hesperia, Victorville, Apple Valley, Barstow, even little ghost towns that do not show up on maps anymore. Eddie Ramirez forgets this sometimes.

He stands on cracked asphalt outside the old George Air Force Base, where the heat bends the horizon into a shimmer. The air smells like burnt oil and creosote, with a sour edge of sunbaked metal. Wind pushes fine sand against his shoes, whispering across the lot like a tired breath. Somewhere far off, a semi groans down the freeway, its sound swallowed by the distance.

Eddie wipes his neck with the back of his hand. His skin feels tacky, his shirt glued to his back. He has been on Indeed applying to every job he can find, and the phone has been silent for weeks.

His last warehouse gig went under in a mass layoff. Not the first time. One company folds, another picks up, same forklifts, different logos. Ten years of that and he is used to starting over.

So when Sunny Side Up Job Agency called, he did not think twice. The voicemail said they needed someone for field inventory. That sounded about right. He had done inventory before.

He should have been confused standing out here in the old George Air Force Base in Adelanto. The hangars in the distance looked like broken teeth, rusted and half eaten by wind. Faded warning signs rattled in the dry air. But instead of being alarmed, Eddie just grinned.

“Figures,” he said with a laugh. “All the good agencies tend to be in weird ass places like this.”

The wind dies all at once. The silence is so sudden it feels heavy. Then the ground hums, not shaking, just vibrating in a low, electric way that prickles through the soles of his boots. The air smells sharper, metallic, like rain that will never come.

Right where the cracked pavement meets the sand, an elevator door slides open. No building. No structure. Just an elevator sunk into the ground, its chrome doors reflecting the desert sky in warped shapes.

A voice crackles from a speaker above it, brittle and flat.

“Eddie Ramirez? Transition Services, field inventory?”

He blinks. “Uh, yeah. That’s me.”

“Step inside, please. Orientation’s waiting.”

Eddie shrugs.

“About time someone took HR seriously,” he mutters, and steps in.

The doors shut, sealing out the desert light.

The elevator drops fast, faster than it should. The air presses against his chest, and his stomach lifts like he is falling through water. The hum deepens into a mechanical growl. Buttons glow faintly on the panel: Lost Souls, Desert Division, and one flickering at the bottom: Sunny Side Up. The lights dim, and the metallic tang of ozone fills his nose.

When the doors open, Eddie smells dust, paper, and something faintly sweet, like burnt sage or old incense. The hallway ahead glows under buzzing fluorescent lights that flicker in slow, dying breaths. The tile floor is cracked and uneven. The air is cold but dry, like an air conditioned tomb.

At the end of the corridor sits a man in a black suit that does not quite fit right. He is thin, pale, eyes like wet ink, and his shadow stretches a little too far across the floor. He has a clipboard and a chipped mug that reads World’s Okayest Reaper.

“Mr. Ramirez,” the man says without looking up. His voice is calm, low, and tired in a way that feels ancient. “Welcome to Sunny Side Up. I am Death. Please, do not touch anything.”

Eddie freezes. “Death like the band? Or like, you know?”

Death sighs, finally meeting his eyes. “The position.”

Eddie nods slowly. “Cool. So this is field inventory then?”

Death smiles faintly, like a teacher grading the world’s dumbest test.

“In a manner of speaking,” he says. “We catalog souls. You will be covering the High Desert region. Hesperia, Victorville, Apple Valley. A hot zone of lost causes and creative deaths.”

He slides the clipboard across the table.

Eddie glances at it. It looks like an employment form, kind of, except under “Position” it reads: Assistant to the Regional Reaper.

Eddie grins.

“Great,” he says, excited. “I hope it’s a temp to hire gig.”

Death does not laugh. He opens a thick folder labeled Orientation. The paper inside smells faintly of smoke.

“Let us begin,” Death says. “Your role, Mr. Ramirez, is simple. You are not here to intervene, interfere, or whatever it is humans think they are doing when they meddle. You will simply observe, record, and file.”

Eddie nods like he is following along.

“You will focus on the unusual deaths that have been occurring in your territory. Anything that does not fit the standard categories. Car accidents, overdoses, stray bullets. We are talking the odd ones. The ones the paperwork cannot explain.”

Eddie scribbles something on the back of a takeout receipt. His handwriting is barely legible. “Got it. Weird deaths. Inventory. Cool.”

Death gives him a long look. “You are not to save anyone,” he continues. “You can die, and you will, frequently. Try to keep it under three times a day. It slows down the paperwork.”

Eddie stops writing. “Wait. Die?”

“Correct. You will respawn, as the mortals say. Usually back at the Circle K near Main Street. Try not to make a habit of it. The clerk is starting to notice.”

Eddie just nods again, pretending to take it in stride. “Circle K. Copy that.”

Death clasps his bony fingers on the table. The air around his hands seems to buzz faintly, as if light itself is uncomfortable near him. “Above all else, no playing detective. You are not to investigate the causes, connect the dots, or question why these deaths are happening. The High Desert is unstable right now. Things slip through the cracks. You are here to count, not to cure.”

Eddie smiles, nodding so hard his chair squeaks. “Absolutely. No problem. Total team player.”

Death studies him for a long, uncomfortable moment. The overhead lights flicker between white and sickly yellow. Something skitters across the ceiling, unseen.

Finally, Death sighs. “You have no idea what you have agreed to, do you?”

Eddie gives a thumbs up. “Sure don’t. But I learn fast.”

Death closes the folder with a sharp snap. The sound echoes like a gunshot. “God help us all,” he mutters. “Or at least the part of Him that still returns calls.”

The elevator behind Eddie chimes softly. A metal tag floats above it, glowing faintly with the numbers 760.

“Your jurisdiction awaits,” Death says. “Welcome to Sunny Side Up.”

Eddie turns back toward the elevator, his heart thudding a little too fast. The metal doors slide open with a hiss of cool air that smells faintly of gasoline and sand. He takes a breath, straightens his shirt, and steps inside.

The doors close.

The elevator hums, dropping deeper than Eddie expects. The floor numbers tick down in strange symbols that look like someone tried to write in cursive after three shots of espresso. The hum shifts pitch, and the buttons flicker again. This time “Sunny Side Up” goes dark. The one above it, labeled simply B 13, lights up instead.

“Guess we are taking the scenic route,” Eddie mutters.

When the doors open, it is not the same hallway. The air smells wrong. Wet concrete and ozone. The lights here are red, pulsing slow like a heartbeat. The walls look newer, smoother, and hum faintly with electricity. He steps out, squinting.

Something huge moves behind frosted glass down the corridor. Its shadow slides across the wall, too many legs, too much height. Eddie freezes, then laughs nervously.

“Wow. You guys really commit to the bit down here.”

He tries the elevator button, but it does not respond. Figures. He starts walking.

The corridor widens into what looks like a lobby from a government building that forgot to stop expanding. Filing cabinets, security monitors, and half a vending machine that reads SOUL REFRESHMENTS. The other half has teeth marks.

He is halfway to a stairwell when a voice behind him says, “You are not supposed to be here.”

Eddie nearly jumps out of his skin. Death is standing there, exactly the same as before, clipboard in hand, coffee mug steaming faintly.

Eddie blinks. “Wait, did not we just, how did you get here?”

Death looks mildly offended. “I walked.”

“From the office?”

“Yes.”

“But we were like,” Eddie points upward, “at least twelve floors ago.”

Death adjusts his tie, ignoring him. “You pressed the wrong button.”

“Yeah, that tracks. What is this floor, the HR basement?”

“Close,” Death says, his tone bone dry. “You have stumbled into the containment levels. Sunny Side Up serves more than just paperwork. It is also where we keep the spillover.”

“Spillover?”

“Things the desert spits out,” Death says. “Evil spirits, creatures, old stories that refuse to die. They used to be worshiped, feared, whispered about around campfires. Now they end up here. We call it myth retention.”

Eddie stares past Death’s shoulder at one of the reinforced doors. The small viewing slit glows faintly red. A voice whispers his name from the other side, soft and wet.

He steps back fast. “Okay. So. Containment. Love that for us. What happens if something gets out?”

Death sighs. “Then we observe. Record. File a report.”

“Wait, you do not stop it?”

“Of course not,” Death says, sounding almost insulted. “We are auditors, not janitors. Intervention would imply agency. Agency would imply fault. We provide data, Mr. Ramirez. Pure, objective, bureaucratic truth.”

Eddie’s face twists. “So when something creepy crawls out of its box and starts haunting Hesperia, you just take notes?”

“Precisely.”

Eddie scratches the back of his neck. “Right. Observation. Got it. Sounds super safe.”

There is a low groan from somewhere behind the walls, metal bending, something testing its restraints. The lights dim for a moment, and Eddie could swear he hears sand trickling, like the desert itself breathing through the cracks.

Death glances at his watch. “It appears one of our guests is restless. You should return upstairs. You are not cleared for this floor.”

“Yeah, no argument here,” Eddie says, already backing toward the elevator.

Death steps closer, eyes gleaming like ink under glass. “Eddie, remember, what escapes will always try to look familiar. It wears faces you trust. Voices you miss. That is how the desert hides its rot.”

Eddie swallows hard. “Thanks for the pep talk, boss.”

The elevator doors slide open again. The air inside smells faintly of asphalt and cheap coffee.

Death’s voice follows him in. “Welcome to the High Desert Division, Mr. Ramirez. Keep your receipts. It is going to be a long audit.”

The doors shut, and the hum returns, lower this time, more like a growl.

As the car rises, Eddie looks at the flickering button labels. “Sunny Side Up” flickers weakly back to life, but above it, a new one glows faintly through the metal. He cannot read it, but it feels like it is watching him.

And somewhere far above, the desert waits.

No matter where Eddie worked, he always got the swing of things pretty fast.

Once he worked at a warehouse owned by a crooked Chinese company. They bought cheap workout equipment, unpacked it, replaced the logo with their own, and sold it as their own brand.

Eddie spent two years there, cleaning mold off benches, shredding paperwork, and keeping OSHA distracted during inspections.

Doing whatever it took to keep his job was what caught Death’s attention.

The high desert had gotten too weird lately. Odd suicides, doomsday cults, people screaming at mangoes in parking lots.

Death could handle weird, but this was starting to bleed into his own affairs. Which meant more paperwork.

He had transferred to the desert division to get away from paperwork. Los Angeles had been getting too crowded, too noisy, too full of car crashes and broken dreams. He had saved enough vacation hours in the 1990s for a full transfer, and by the turn of the century, Death had founded Sunny Side Up: Desert Division.

The desert was full of myths, lost souls, spirits, and tumbleweeds. They needed to be contained of course.

For now though, Death needed to make sure Eddie at least got the tax forms filled out and his photo taken for the badge.

Death handed Eddie a clipboard stacked with forms and motioned for him to stand against a blank wall.

“Smile,” Death said.

A flash went off before Eddie even had time to blink. His new badge printed itself from a slot in the wall, still warm. The photo came out fine, if a little washed out. He looked half-awake, half-terrified, which felt about right.

“Alright,” Death said, checking the image. “You look alive enough.”

The way he said it made Eddie wonder if that was an actual requirement.

Death handed back the clipboard, and Eddie noticed his fingers weren’t consistent. One second they were bony, the next they were perfectly normal. The lighting never changed, but Death seemed to shift under it anyway, like a trick of the eye that refused to end.

Eddie tried to act casual. “So, uh, how’d you get here so fast? I didn’t see you take the elevator.”

Death looked at him, calm and unblinking. “Eddie, I am the building.”

Eddie laughed. Then stopped when he realized Death wasn’t joking. “Like… metaphorically?”

“No,” Death said. “Literally.”

The overhead lights dimmed for a moment, just enough to notice. Somewhere down the hall, a typewriter started clacking without fingers. A door opened on its own, releasing a draft that smelled faintly of rain and static. The floor vibrated under Eddie’s boots, like something massive had rolled over deep below the foundation.

Death adjusted his tie. “You will get used to it.”

Eddie nodded slowly. “Right. Makes sense.”

He pocketed his badge and looked around again. The hallways seemed longer now. The walls breathed faintly. He could swear he heard faint music behind the doors it was an elevator tune, warped and reversed.

The smell of coffee lingered in the air, but it was old coffee. Burnt. Eternal.

He passed a bulletin board on the wall. There were flyers pinned under yellowing paper: Lost Soul Recovery Training, Tuesdays at 6. Mandatory for Field Agents. Another read, Do not open the fridge after midnight. Seriously.

Down the hall, a vending machine flickered with static on its display. The options read things like Oblivion, Hope (Diet), and Salted Cashews.

Eddie had worked in a lot of strange places before, but this one was different. The air hummed with something alive.

Sunny Side Up wasn’t just an office. It was alive.

We've gone thru many rough spells, lots of emotional manipulation, deflection, rages and self pitying/victimisation from her. 

I am proud of myself for my patience and resilience but wish I could stand up for myself more when faced with this behaviour. I am certain she is vulnerable narc or BPD. 

During one flare about 4 months ago she was in a foul mood all morning. I was trying my best to help her, make her coffee/breakfast etc. She told me to leave as I had a haircut booked and other plans for the day. When I returned she said ""I wish you hadn't left today"" (confused cos she had told me to leave). The berating escalated, she said she felt shit about herself cos she could tell I was walking on eggshells around her (more confused cos she wanted me to stay/told me to leave/my nervous presence made her feel shit!). I raised my voice a little (which I very rarely do) and told her to stop talking to me like this. She escalated my, saying I was being horrible to her and that she was just being horrible back at me. I was then accused of being selfish and uncaring because ""I'd left her home alone all day while she was thinking of self harming"", that was the first I'd heard of it (obviously I was very concerned for her after she said that but I realise now it was textbook emotional abuse).

The next day I had the courage to tell her that when she speaks to me that way I feel despised, worthless and unsafe. I explained that she had spoken to me that way many times and that I couldn't tolerate it anymore.

To my surprise she was very apologetic, no excuses or deflection, just seemed very sorry she had made me feel that way and ashamed in herself. 

Since then there has been about 4 months of relative peace, we have been getting on well for the longest I can remember really.

Despite this improvement I still feel stressed, monitor my behaviour based on her mood and am constantly looking out for signs of her next tantrum. We are travelling next month which has previously been a big source of stress, so I'm not looking forward to it but will be paying close attention to how she speaks to me. I will try my best to hold her accountable if she explodes on me i.e. When I say I CAN'T tolerate it I mean I WON'T tolerate it. 

I don't know how to feel. On one hand I'm glad things are going better. On the other I'm worried she is just suppressing anger and resentment, not letting it out until it eventually overflows all over me! 

I do love her but I don't know if I can trust her anymore, my trust has been broken one too many times. 

Just looking for some thoughts, support, advice, validation from people who've been in similar situations. 

Thanks

1oirvg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/1oirvg9/food_donation_ideas/,Food Donation Ideas,"There are so many wonderful people in our community with big hearts who want to give and help families who are struggling. 

Food banks and charities are doing amazing work. Donating to them helps so many people, and also it's important to remember that not everyone has the ability to access these community resources. 

Folks who manage Little Free Libraries are making space to include food items. There are also already established ""Little Free Pantry"" locations that can use donations. These are great, and can use smaller donations more frequently. One near me can be full at 5pm and empty by 8pm. I try to bring things at different times a day, several days during the week. Some folks are donating directly to families via social media or neighborhood groups. 

I'd like to suggest some food items that are especially helpful for families and people in difficult/challenging situations, and some things to think about when deciding what to donate. 

When thinking about what to donate, consider what your kids like to eat for breakfast on weekends. 

What do they grab in the kitchen after school to fix for themselves? 

What do they eat when parents aren't home from work at dinnertime or when their single parent is sick and not up to fixing a meal?

When the power is out after a storm, what are you preparing to eat? 

What's for lunch/dinner in the days after surgery/chemo? 

If your kids have nut or dairy allergies, what are their comfort foods? 

And the promised specific food item suggestions: 

\* Shelf-stable milk, almond milk

\* Drinks (gatorade, water, Hugs barrels, capri-sun, etc)

\* Hot cocoa, tea, coffee (beans, ground, or k-cups - all are useful to someone!)

\* Boost, Ensure, Slim-Fast, etc

\* Mac & Cheese cups

\* Ramen, ramen cups

\* Easy open canned food: ravioli, spaghetti & meatballs, soup, etc

\* Fruit cups, applesauce

\* Veggie single serve cups

\* Hormel Compleat meals

\* Banquet Homestyle Bake boxes

\* single serve cereal cups/boxes, oatmeal cups/packets

\* condiments/spices - mayo, ketchup, relish, salt, pepper, etc",8,1761701790.0,olympia,3,0.83,False

i know that there are roasters like sey here in the u.s. that really focus on making sure these producers are paid appropriately, which is the case for many roasters that are popular in this sub. that being said, to your knowledge, who are some other utmost ethical roasters in the u.s.? i would say internationally as well, but i can’t afford trump’s dumbass tariffs right now. also, which renowned roasters aren’t as ethical as you would hope or expect? particularly those popular among pourover/drip coffee enthusiasts. i am still relatively new to coffee in a meaningful sense, but i know many of you have already had years of experience and research under your belts just as hobbyists who care about coffee and those who produce it. thank you for any insight! cheers!",1,1761701536.0,pourover,23,0.53,False

1oirlre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1oirlre/spiderman_prime_1/,Spider-Man Prime 1#,"In the night of New York City, a group of elite mercenaries breaks into a secure building, stealing a drive containing the information their boss needed. Their leader, Beetle, steps forward, saying the mission is complete.

That’s when a voice echoes from above.

Spider-Man (off-screen):
“You know, if you guys wanted a souvenir, the gift shop’s downstairs on the left. Although I don’t think they allow bad guy discounts.”

Spider-Man drops down, landing in front of them. In an instant, webs fly — their weapons are ripped away, and he takes them down one by one. He’s surprised to see Beetle after all this time, though not shocked — Beetle’s a hired gun, after all.

Beetle raises his arm and fires his blasters, but Spider-Man easily dodges. Beetle then activates his plasma blades, hoping to cut down the wall-crawler.

Spider-Man:
“Usually reunions start with hugs, handshakes… and hey, a gift wouldn’t kill. Or does trying to kill me mean you’re happy to see me?”

Beetle:
“You were very irritating the last time we saw each other.”

Spider-Man:
“Ah, so you do remember! Glad you really thought this through. But hey — I’m more charming now.”

Beetle lunges forward for a strike, but Spider-Man moves out of the way and counters with an uppercut, then kicks Beetle back into a wall. Beetle throws down an energy grenade to distract him, and the explosion nearly buries Spider-Man in rubble. He manages to break free just in time to see Beetle trying to escape.

Spider-Man:
“Leaving so soon? We were just having a good chat. How about we talk about that drive you stole — maybe get a coffee afterwards?”

Beetle:
“I think you should worry about my men you knocked down. You see, I placed bombs on their suits. All I have to do is activate them and… well, use your imagination. So, you can either save them… or stop me.”

Spider-Man:
“You’re bluffing.”

Beetle:
“Try me, hero.”

Spider-Man hesitates. He can’t stop Beetle without risking the lives of the mercenaries. Sure, they’re criminals, but he’s not a killer. Then Beetle activates the bombs — they’re on a timer.

Spider-Man rushes to deactivate them, moving as fast as he can while Beetle flies away. He works frantically, realizing he won’t be able to stop them all. With seconds left, he grabs the remaining suits and throws them as far as he can before the bombs explode. The blast knocks him back hard.

Spider-Man slowly gets up, dusting himself off.

Spider-Man (sighs):
“Definitely need a vacation. Hoping these guys try not to kill me for a while.”


CUT TO:
Beetle enters a warehouse, waiting for his client. A man steps out of the shadows — Richard Fisk, better known as The Rose.

Rose:
“I see you were able to get the drive. I’m impressed, Beetle. Your reputation was indeed true.”

Beetle:
“I’ll admit we had some issues. Spider-Man almost interfered with the heist.”

Rose:
“A minor problem. Soon, my plan will come to motion. The information from this drive will help us make this city suffer — along with Spider-Man.”

Beetle:
“Many have tried to put fear into this city, Mr. Fisk… including your father.”

Rose:
“My father was a fool. A man who thought his vision would come true — the ‘Kingpin of Crime,’ now sitting in a cell. Pathetic.”

Beetle:
“So what exactly are you planning, if I may ask?”

Rose:
“Let me ask you this. Why do criminals use fear to control others? Because they think fear gives them power. Tombstone, Silvermane, Kingpin — all used the illusion of fear. But Spider-Man proved that illusion can be broken. I’m going to unleash the true meaning of fear.”

Beetle:
“I’m listening.”

Rose just smiles beneath his mask.

The next day, Peter heads to work, still wondering why Beetle was after that drive. He hasn’t seen him in years, so whatever was on that drive must be important. Beetle’s obviously working for someone, and Peter’s determined to find out who.

He approaches the Oscorp building and walks inside.

Harry:
“Pete! Always on time. Guess the old Parker luck’s lost its touch.”

Peter:
“I’m just that good, Harry. This isn’t high school or college anymore. Oh, and nice mustache — trying to get the ladies’ attention?”

Harry (laughing):
“Very funny, smart guy. The ladies love it — don’t be jealous.”

Peter:
“Oh, I’m definitely jealous. I remember that one person you dated — what was his name again?”

Harry:
“Always with the comebacks, huh? Keep that up and I’ll have to fire you.”

Peter (laughing):
“Sure, get rid of your best scientist and best friend. See how well that goes.”

Harry:
“Fair point. Still, those results you gave me last week — amazing work.”

Peter:
“Wait, really? Already? I wasn’t sure the cells would hold after the first round of tests.”

Harry:
“They did. We might actually be able to cure certain diseases with this serum. We’ll be heroes.”

Peter:
“That’s incredible. I’ll go over the data again, just to be safe.”

Harry:
“Good idea. I’ve gotta head over to the main Oscorp facility to make sure things are running smoothly. Not easy being CEO, but ever since I lost Dad, I’ve felt like it’s what he would’ve wanted.”

Peter:
“Yeah, well… at least you’re doing your best.”

Harry:
“I’ll be back later. Don’t forget to lock up when you’re done — can’t have anyone stealing our ideas.”

Peter:
“I think we’ll be fine. See you later, Harry — have fun.”

Later that day, Peter goes over his work while still thinking about Beetle and that stolen drive. There’s only one way to find out what’s really going on.

That night, Spider-Man swings back to the building Beetle hit. He slips inside, avoiding the guards, and checks the offices. Inside, he finds files that track various villains and criminals — their backgrounds, status, and locations. Most of them are either retired or in prison.

So, the real question is: who is Beetle’s client looking for?

Meanwhile, in an asylum, Rose stands in front of a reinforced glass cell, speaking to someone inside.

Rose:
“What a lovely place you’ve got yourself into. Could be cleaner.”

Man’s Voice (chuckling):
“So what does Kingpin Junior want with me? As you can see, I’m enjoying myself here.”

Rose:
“I offer you not only freedom… but a chance for this city to truly understand what fear is. I believe you’re the one who can make that happen.”

The man laughs — cold and wild.

Man:
“Oh, trust me. I do more than just put fear into people. I live for it. Making others feel pain — that’s what brings me joy. Nobody knows that better than me.”

Rose:
“I have a plan — one that will benefit you the most, if you’re willing to take it. Many would kill for such an opportunity.”

Man:
“What about Spider-Man? Can’t have a party without that clown ruining everything.”

Rose:
“Spider-Man will fail. And when he does… this city will never forget it.”

The man smiles — Cletus Kasady.

He leans forward, eyes gleaming with madness.

Cletus:
“Well now… seems there’s gonna be plenty of carnage.”

1oirika,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oirika/ikea_with_leah/,IKEA with Leah.,"It started as one of those “we’ll just run in for one thing” kind of days, the sort of innocent plan that always ends in wandering through IKEA for three hours, questioning life choices, and pretending you know how to pronounce “Fjällbo.”

You’d decided that morning, while flipping through records stacked in semi-neat piles by the turntable, that it was time to get organized. The Kallax, the holy grail of record storage, had been on the “we should probably do this” list for months. Leah agreed immediately, though you could tell she was more excited about the meatballs than the shelving.

By late morning, coffee mugs empty, you were both in the car. Lucy watched you from the window as you pulled out of the driveway, ears perked in mild disapproval at not being invited. The day was gray but mild, the kind of Sunday that felt made for errands and low-stakes adventures.

“Okay,” Leah said as she buckled her seatbelt. “Rules of engagement. We get the Kallax, we get the baskets, and then we leave. No rugs, no glassware, no random lamps named ‘Örkendal.’”

“Understood,” you said solemnly. “We are warriors of focus.”

She looked at you over the top of her glasses. “You’re going to stop in the kitchen section, aren’t you?”

“…maybe.”

By the time you got to IKEA, it was already half full, parents wrangling kids, couples pretending not to fight about sectionals, the faint smell of cinnamon rolls wafting through the air. Leah grabbed a yellow bag and looked at you. “This is how they get us,” she whispered.

You started through the maze. Living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, all perfectly staged lives in tiny boxes. Leah ran her fingers along a sleek table and said, “I could live here. I’d just… need a door.”

“Two doors,” you said. “And an actual bed.”

She pointed at one of those minimalist show setups, a fake apartment no bigger than a parking space. “Don’t judge. That’s all I need. Coffee maker, bookshelf, you.”

That made you laugh. “In that order?”

She grinned. “Depends on the morning.”

Eventually, you found the Kallax. The real thing. Rows of perfect squares that seemed to glow under the fluorescent lights. “There she is,” Leah said reverently, crouching down to read the tag. “White or birch?”

“Birch,” you said. “Feels warmer.”

“Agreed.” She tapped the box with satisfaction. “We are officially adults. People with cube storage.”

You loaded it onto the cart and, true to your earlier prophecy, made a detour through kitchenware. Leah held up a garlic press you didn’t need, then put it back after a dramatic sigh. “Fine. Focus.”

At checkout, you shared a soft-serve cone, because that’s what you do after surviving IKEA. Leah had chocolate on her thumb and didn’t notice until you reached over and wiped it off. “You’re ridiculous,” she said, smiling anyway.

The drive home was quiet. The box filled the back seat, and Leah had one leg tucked under her, head leaned against the window, humming softly to whatever was playing on the stereo, probably Air or Zero 7, something smooth and half-dreaming.

Back at the house, Lucy greeted you like you’d been gone for weeks. You set up in the living room, tools scattered, record sleeves stacked high. Leah read the instructions, squinting. “These are hieroglyphics,” she said. “Is that a hammer or a sad Swedish man?”

You laughed. “Both.”

It took an hour, a brief argument about dowels, and a quiet truce over a beer, but eventually the Kallax stood proudly against the wall. Level, solid, and already half full of records. Leah sat cross-legged on the floor, sliding albums into place: Massive Attack, Zero 7, Bonobo, Air, Beth Orton. Each one she touched, she said softly, “Keeper.”

When the last record went in, she leaned back against your knees and looked up. “You realize we’ve officially entered middle age. We just spent our Sunday building furniture and alphabetizing vinyl.”

You smiled. “And it’s perfect.”

She reached up, pulled you down for a kiss, and whispered, “Clause 247: all IKEA adventures end with big smooches.”

The Kallax gleamed. The records were home. And somewhere between the scent of sawdust and the crackle of the first record spinning that night, you realized, yeah. It really was perfect.",0,1761700793.0,stories,0,0.33,False

The first thing anyone ever said about Vince Karr was that he was loud.
Not good — just *loud.*

He’d grown up in the back alleys of Asbury Park, tuning cheap guitars with cigarette burns on the necks and stickers that said things like *“Corporate Music Kills”* and *“DIY or Die.”*
He couldn’t actually build anything himself — unless you counted the mountain of empty Monster cans in his room — but the sticker gave him a moral high ground he enjoyed occupying.

His band, **The Safety Pins**, wasn’t half bad. Which was to say, they were three-quarters bad and one-quarter charming.
They played in garages, laundromats, one abandoned bowling alley, and once — memorably — in a vegan coffee shop where they were paid in exposure and leftover oat milk.
Vince was frontman, lead guitarist, lyricist, and the only one who thought he was destined for greatness.

Then came the day that ruined everything.

---

It started when he posted a sloppy acoustic cover of his song *“No Future in 4/4 Time”* online.
He didn’t expect anyone to care — he didn’t even finish tuning the last string before he hit record.
But a week later, his inbox had a message from someone named **Dr. Rosenthal**.
A faculty chair. At Juilliard.

At first, Vince thought it was spam.
The subject line read: *“Invitation to Apply for Scholarship – Composition Program.”*
He assumed “Composition” meant deodorant or something.

He showed it to his drummer, Snipe, who laughed so hard he spilled beer on the laptop.
“Bro,” Snipe said, “that’s like Hogwarts for nerds.”
Vince nodded sagely. “Exactly. Which means it’s time someone burned it down from the inside.”

---

The next month, he was on a train to New York City. His leather jacket smelled like smoke and defiance. His guitar case was plastered with stickers that screamed rebellion in Helvetica.
When he stepped onto campus, he immediately called it *“a crime scene of conformity.”*

He walked past a group of students sight-reading Bach and muttered, “Sellouts.”
One of them raised an eyebrow and said, “You’re holding your guitar upside down.”

---

Vince’s first class was *Music Theory I*.
He thought theory was a band name.

The professor, a wiry man with hair like static, asked everyone to play their instrument for thirty seconds.
When it was Vince’s turn, he played three chords and screamed, “I hate my dad!”

There was silence.
Then polite applause.

The professor said, “Interesting use of minimalism.”

---

By midterm, Vince had accidentally become the talk of the school.
Half the faculty thought he was a genius deconstructing Western tonality; the other half thought he was a janitor who got lost.

He started sneaking into practice rooms at night, curious about what made the others so obsessed with precision.
At first, he mocked them — “Oh, look, another C major scale, how punk rock.”
But then, one night, he sat down at a grand piano.

He pressed a single key.
It hummed like thunder underwater.

He stayed there for hours, just pressing notes, whispering, “Huh.”

---

There was a girl, of course.
Lena, a violinist who practiced until her fingers bled. She told him, “Metal is just classical music played drunk.”
He told her, “Classical is punk that sold out.”
They argued every night after curfew, until the arguments turned into duets.

Vince wrote his final composition for her.
He called it *“Concerto for Feedback and Bow.”*

When he performed it, half the audience left. The other half cried.

---

The dean offered him a place in the graduate program.
“Your work challenges convention,” the dean said.

Vince squinted. “I was mostly just mad.”

“Exactly,” said the dean. “That’s art.”

---

Vince turned it down.
He left Juilliard the next day, walking down Broadway with his guitar slung over his back and his diploma stuffed into a pizza box.

He wasn’t sure if he’d sold out or finally tuned in.
But he smiled, just once, at the thought of his mother back home, showing his acceptance letter to every customer at the diner.

She’d say, *“My boy’s a musician now.”*
And she’d be right — for the first time.

---

**EPILOGUE**

Years later, people would still talk about the “punk kid who crashed Juilliard.”
Some said he was a fraud. Others said he was a visionary.

Vince would just shrug, light a cigarette, and mumble:
“Never Juilliard.”

Then he’d play something beautiful, by accident.

1oire0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1oire0r/refused_service_at_shibuya_coffee_shop_for_using/,Refused service at Shibuya coffee shop for using bathroom,"My partner and I were in Tokyo a few days ago and visited a coffee shop in Shibuya - he really likes flat whites and likes to try various places whenever we travel. We went into a small coffee shop where the barista (and owner) was doing a slow pour-over for a customer, which they were both watching intently. We were in the queue behind, and I went to the bathroom while my partner waited in line (there was no one else behind us and only 3 people in the coffee shop).

When I came out my partner looked upset and said ""we've been asked to leave"". I thought maybe there wasn't enough space for us? I asked why and he said ""You didn't ask his permission to use the bathroom"". He had tried to apologise and tell him we meant no disrespect, however the barista (through translation app) said he was ""tired of people from overseas making assumptions"", told him we had to leave and then turned his back on him and refused to engage. My partner described him as extremely angry and was quite upset by the interaction.

We were pretty shocked to be refused service and asked to leave, in addition to me being highly embarrassed. We are both respectful, quiet, and just like good coffee. I'm not a world expert on bathroom etiquette but I've travelled a fair bit and been to Japan 3 times and never come across this expectation. It really put a dampener on our trip, we were quite sad for a few days, and we are now nervous about our interactions as we continue to travel. Is this something we should have known about?

1oirc3l,https://i.redd.it/3r68d08gbyxf1.png,Fanojo Concept #2,"Name: Kami Kikoemasu (聞こえます 神), meaning ""I hear you, God.""

Age: 17-year-old shrine maiden.

Personality: Kami is an individual that tends to overwork herself to the brink of exhaustion, which leads to her passing out randomly, causing bruises and marks all over her body, though she wakes up not knowing why or how she acquired them. She's a heavy workaholic and crowd pleaser, believing there's always more to be done around the shine to make others happy.

She has severe atelophobia (fear of imperfection), and finds herself anxiously pondering what others think about her, especially Rentarou and the other girlfriends. She's such a crowd pleaser that even the smallest mistake is considered a failure to her. Due to this, she's known, at times, to run away sobbing from the stress if it becomes too much, fleeing to a hidden area within the shrines' premises, so she can have peace and quiet.

Apart from being a crowd pleaser, Kami is a sociable, shy individual who normally stays calm and collected, even under immense pressure, excluding when said pressure pertains to her duties as a shrine maiden. Otherwise, she's quite loving and enjoys hanging around the others, no matter the crowd. She also always aims to please each of them, no matter who she's with.

Finally, she's quite naive and always aim to see the best in everyone, believing that all humans are redeemable, unlike Meru and Aisuru's contradictory views of the world. This kindness and naivety, in fact, can lead to her being taken advantage of and used for other people's gains.

How does she meet Rentarou?: While she's attending to the shrine, Rentarou happens to be passing by, as he's on his way to visit the Love God and pray for his girlfriends' eternal happiness. He notices the peaceful shrine as he's walking, and stops to take a look, having heard much about it. As he's looking around, he hears a soft voice call out to him. He sees the shrine maiden, who introduces herself as Kami Shinsha.

She's wearing a veil, though, so there's no instant zing, leaving him curious and confused about her. Wanting to learn more, he aims to strike up conversation, and she requests he walk with her, which he agrees to. As they're walking and conversing, Kami hears an odd sound.

She goes to investigate, only to accidentally slip as she's stepping down from the shrines' steps. Before she can fall, Rentarou manages to catch her, but her veil fell halfway down from the sudden jerky movement, revealing her eyes. Suddenly, their eyes meet and... *ZING!!!*

Origins: Kami is fully Japanese, with slightly German roots from far off ancestors, yet not enough to be prominent in her heritage.

Background: She is from a middle class family that worships numerous gods.

Believed to be a divine prophet chosen by the gods from a young age, Kami has always been quite spoiled. This is because, when she was younger, not only was she a miracle child (having her was difficult and nearly killed her mother), but she was born with distinguishable traits that made her unique in comparison to her other relatives.

It is because of this that she's always been noted as a special child; furthermore, upon reaching a certain age, she claimed to hear whispers of the gods' prophecies, and told disbelieving comrades about said prophecies. These prophecies, over 5 of them, were proven true, within the time limit stated by her.

Upon this revelation, the shrine attendants meet her, and request her parents that she may serve as the acting priestess of their shrine, to which they happily agreed. And since then, no matter the prophecy, she's never been wrong, leading to visitors praying to her as well as the acting gods of the shrine, begging for their wants to be fulfilled. They also request her to converse with the gods for them, and to bring good news to them upon their blessings and prayers being answered.

Quirk: She's said to have the ability to hear the whispers of the gods, and has always been referred to as a divine messenger by shrine attendants around her, who worship her as well for her ""services.""

She is a perfectionist shrine attendant who aims to make others happy, even if it costs her as well. Alongside this, Kami also has issues with insomnia, as she drinks over 3-6 cups of coffee within a day so she can complete all the tasks she needs with precision, stating that: ""Sleep is for the weak-minded, and I must not let my resolve falter.""

100Kanojo friends: Shizuka, Mei, Mimimi, Meme, Chiyo, Yamame, Uto, Himeka(???), Usami, Nemu, Hasuha, Eru, and Jiai.

Fun facts: 

- Her birthday is on October 31st, which is the end of the Kannazuki Festival, which celebrates the return of the Gods from their meeting with one another.

- She's cautious around Saiki, whose worshipping of her abnormality makes her uncomfortable and anxious.

- She enjoys Meme's company the most, as she finds hanging out with her is calming and relaxing, along with the fact she can relate to Meme's shyness.

- She pairs well with almost any girlfriend, because she can adapt to different personalities with ease.

- She's not in school, like Mai, because of the fact thay she's working as a full time shrine maiden, and was never offered to be enrolled in school by her parents.

- The bandages on her arms and hands are from injuries/scars gained due to passing out and falling hard on the ground.

- Her eyes are fully covered by a white veil, due to the shrines' beliefs about priestess' needing to wear veils at all times. Only Rentarou has seen her eyes.

- Like Meme, she has one of the most voluptuous figures, which is covered by her clothing choice. Even though this is the case, she's a likely contender for Hahari's spot as the most well-endowed girlfriend.

- And although she has such a figure, she's extremely innocent even when Hakari tells her about her (pervy) dreams and thoughts, which ends up leaving her more confused than traumatized.

- She's also met multiple gods, whereas Rentarou and Matsuri have only met one. (Albeit, Rentarou has met two if we count the Infinity God from that one festival chapter.)

Her name is derived from ""Kami Kikoemasu,"" which is a rough translation of ""I hear the gods.""

And, she's likely the closest thing we'd get to an otherworldly girlfriend. (Although, knowing Nozawa and Nakamura, nothing is impossible...)",5,1761700303.0,100Fanojo,1,1.0,False
