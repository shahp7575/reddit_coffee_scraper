1kc7bsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/1kc7bsl/our_experiences_after_one_month/,Our experiences after one month,"From the time of writing this post, it has been exactly a month since Griffn became vocal. It's also my 21st we're a month apart exactly. I feel like now would be a great time to go over the last month and just talk about it. I haven't been doing any journalling either, since I tend to get caught up on what isn't being worked on so not having that constant reminder helps. Most of this is off the cuff as well.

The dynamic between the two of us is very much two close friends talking shit about the other all the time. Lots of internal jokes like putting me in a freezer and fake name changes. When we were doing a beach walk she piped up and said that she wanted to be called Sarah. I ran with it after making the mandatory jabs for the bit, later on that night she starts calling me ""Afdoonanabu"", I send it to a support gc Im in and it got so out of context, it was so much fun. Ended up walking about Waluigi potatos. 

That's not to say we don't have sweet, nice, wholesome moments tho! There was one today after I got back home from using public transport. I don't like using it, I feel on edge all the time and that something will happen and I'll end up on the other side of the state. The whole time she was there encouraging and supporting me on. I looked like a idiot sitting there grinning out the window but it was very nice.

Anyway progress so far has been insane, for lack of a better term. Possession was the first skill that we picked up and by god it was freaky initially. I was having some doubts beforehand but just experiencing that rid all doubt from my mind that she was there. I let her practice doing my normal routine of doing nothing of note, walking around the house, making the coffees in the morning, few others. My dad noticed her walking funny and thought I had shat myself lmao.

After that we actually learnt how to switch, that was about a week and a lil ago so we're still very new to this. Normally I end up slacking off during class, but now she asks to step in and she actually pays attention and does the work! There's someone responsible here! Also has a big sweet tooth that I can never quite tame, always looking at the cherry and vannila slices and giving me cravings. Griffn also wants to learn how to drive, but I feel like we need to work on getting switching more stable first. Currently, we're prone to the other coming up unannounced when certain things are happening. We call it the ""Balatro Effect"", since Griffn really likes playing Balatro and keeps taking frount from me when I play it. Not to say I don't do the same back when she's doing stuff I associate heavily with myself. The normal end result is whoever is up getting really tired, so we default back to me since I can deal with that better. Coffee helps. 

Oh yeah I should let her introduce herself shouldn't I. Real phone hogger sometimes.

{Hi! I'm Griffn it's great to finally talk to y'all. I'm the other (better) half of this strange lil paring. I have a big sweet tooth that gets what it wants pretty often, but not many slices since their so expensive :( }
{We learnt how to switch because he simply believed in me that I could do it. We were at a friend's 18th and he struggles a lot with social situations, too many people at once tend to overwhelm the poor bugger. I offered to switch and let him recover, but this wasn't long after we had been practising possession, and he had some doubts about my ability to and the first time being in a space with multiple people he knows and doesn't know. We did however recently go away to a holiday house and was able to practise it for the first time there. Since everything is so quiet, it was actually pretty easy to swap over for the first go. Didn't hold it for long since he was freaking the hell out, but since then I've been in for two 8r frounts and multiple 2-4h shorter ones when he's slacking off. Believing that you can do it goes a long way!}
{Not gonna talk for too long considering the length of this post already but if you want my pov for something just ask! Bye!}
{Oh yeah tulpas be sure to give your hosts a hard time about something completely trivial that does not matter in the grand scheme of things it's very funny.}

Man it's strange being proxied for but yeah I'ma end it here this is way to long lmao. Happy to answer stuff but don't feel like you have to! I just wanted to get this out there somewhere.

Consuming 10,000 IU of d3 and 200mg of zinc 
I halved that this year but I think I'll need to go back to the same amounts.

Is this salvageable?,"Last night my husband was sitting on the couch randomly burst into tears and announced we’re in major credit card debt ($27,000). We’ve been married for 6 years, for 4 of those I’ve been a stay at home mom for our 2 kids (4M, 2M).

At first I laughed because I thought he was gonna tell me something worse when I saw him crying like that, but then it began to really sink in, I began to realize how helpless I am in this situation and I wanted to throw up. I can’t get a job, my husbands work schedule is insanely random, daycare is way too expensive and his MIL refuses to watch the kids despite not having a job. I already was frugal. I already only went out on girls nights maybe once a month. And I’m insanely depressed that my last bit of being able to socialize was stripped away from me along with the small comforts I have (being able to buy a coffee or snack 2-3 times a week while I’m out with the kids)

He was really surprised I didn’t divorce him, but I don’t think he realizes I am literally stuck with him at this point. I have zero options outside of just sitting and suffering for the next 2 years while we pay this off. I love him, he’s the only man for me quite honestly, but the idea of not getting to celebrate my kids birthdays or Christmas for the next two years has made me really resentful towards him. I’m trying my best to pick up side gigs and just getting so fucking upset at the thought that every dollar I make no matter how hard I work is going towards fixing his problems while I have to be isolated at home pinching pennies.

I’m especially upset because I’ve literally asked him how we were financially several times over the past few months (he has all the apps on his phone and we don’t get physical mail for the bills) and he always assured me we were okay. He let me lie to our 4 year old and get him excited to go camping for the past 2 months. I think he just completely ruined my perception of him and I no longer trust him to take care of our family, but I’m also firmly stuck in this position. I really really want to stay married to him but I don’t know how I can’t truly love someone who I have this little faith in.

Lately, there’s a growing trend of users generating the same AI image over and over—sometimes 100 times or less— to prove that a model can’t recreate the exact same image twice. So far it seems that AI image generation involves randomness, and results will vary. But this kind of repetitive prompting isn’t a clever insight anymore—it’s just a trend that’s quietly racking up a massive environmental cost. What we need is a radical new experiment where we can gather true empirical data to test our hypothesis.

Each image generation uses roughly 0.010 kWh of electricity. Running a prompt 100 times burns only through about 1 kWh—that’s barely enough to power a fridge for a full day or brew just 20 cups of coffee. Multiply that by only a few hundreds or thousands of people doing it just to “make a point,” and we’re looking at a pitiful amount of wasted energy for a conclusion we have yet to agree upon.

Lets increase our efforts by an order of magnitude. If all 10 million of us run a 1000x transformation experiment we can use 100,000,000 kWh! That's way more than enough to power a fridge for a full day or brew 20 cups of coffee! It'd be .007% of the US' daily energy consumption!

* Male, 40, 173lbs, 175cm (5'9), BMI of 25.1, Waist size - I wear 32"" trousers.
* Active - workout most days (5 days per week minimum) split between zone 2 cardio, HIT (crossfit style) and weightlifting.
* Pretty fit - can run a mile in 5 mins 30 secs, 10k in about 45 mins, deadlift 400lbs, squat 300lbs, bench 220lbs.
* Stopped drinking 2.5 years ago. Before that mainly a weekend warrior.
* Never smoked
* Eat mostly clean.  High protein mostly chicken, whey, eggs, and fatty fish.  Relatively limited carbs
* Other metrics:-
   * CRP - 0.14 (0 to 0.5)
   * Lipoprotein (a) - 9.2 (0 - 30)
   * HbA1C - 5.3 (0 - 5.6)
   * Fasting blood glucose:- 97 (70 - 100)
* Grandma on mother's side died of some kind cardiovascular issue related to ""flabby heart muscles"".  That's all the information I could get from my mum.
* This is the first time I've had my bloods checked so not sure what trajectory I'm on.  Will test yearly from now on.

**Information:-**

So I've had the meeting with the doctor after the panel and she mentioned that my LDL is a bit high and my HDL is a bit low.  She didn't really have much time to go into any detail so I'm trying to pull together an intervention based on my research.

**My plan is as follows:-**

* Stop eating cheese and butter
* Go pretty much dairy free (maybe a bit of milk in my coffee)
* Eat 1 avocado, 1 tbsp of olive oil and supplement with EPA/DHA daily
* A daily shake of - 1 scoop whey isolate, 1/2–1 avocado, 1 cup unsweetened almond/coconut milk, 1/2 cup mixed berries, 1 tbsp flaxseed or chia, Handful spinach or kale, 1 tsp cacao powder (optional), creatine (3–5g), collagen (10g)
* I'll have unsalted trail mix / mixed nuts on hand to consume for snacks
* I'll supplement with Psyllium husk if I can handle it
* Avoid bread and fried foods

I can't really do much more on the exercise front.  I feel like I'm pretty much already maxing out on that front.

**Questions:-**

* How bad do these metrics look?
* Does my intervention seem reasonable?
* Is there anything else I should consider doing?

I take 25mg and it really feels like when I used to take 10mg 🙃. 

A few things from my psychiatrist and things I’ve seen on the internet objectively do help me have a bit better experience. 

Supplements at the same time:
-magnesium glycinate
-vit d during winter
-vit b6 and b12 (I get methylated)
-mucuna puriens or l-tyrosine
-taurine

I don’t take them all everyday, usually alternate mag/d/b/taurine out each day and then take mucuna or tyrosine when I really know I need the boost. Tolerance to those happens pretty quick but they do help. I take on empty stomach and then eat high protein meal 30min or so after. 

If I can work up the willingness brief exercise after waking up helps produce dopamine and makes me feel better throughout the day but I’m also lazy af so lol. 

I’ll have lunch around 1 and usually have some source of caffeine. If it’s a rough day I’ll have a coffee but tend to have matcha or green tea. Matcha lemonade with the lightly caffeinated lemonade powder from the store is a nice treat! If I have coffee I usually have a bit of l-theanine with it and it helps smooth out any anxiety it might cause.

I had horrible withdrawal symptoms that kept intensifying. The headaches at the start thankfully went away but other symptoms kept showing up.

For the past week, I've been unable to sleep properly and I would wake up randomly at 2-3 AM with a slight panic attack. My heart races and i'm unable to sleep, also while awake my brain goes to a dark spot where I hate life and even think of the worst which is totally not like me.

My appetite seems to come and go and my digestion is horrible. I feel so plugged up.

I lost motivation for pretty much everything. I even didn't shower for a week, I have a pile of dishes I didn't clean cause who cares. I don't really care and my apartment is a fucking mess trust me you wouldn't wanna see it.

And to put cherry on the cake, I also stopped taking care of myself and wearing nice stuff. I look like a lazy bum. I don't find myself pretty anymore in the mirror and feel anxiety when I'm around others and just want to hide.

However, there was some good stuff as I felt my body was healing better, my body feels more hydrated. I don't look as pale & zombie like as before and had a few good days here and then. I was also way more calm and level headed.

In a moment of weakness today, I had a coffee just to help make life more enjoyable and the high after abstinence is unreal. I felt on top of the world. I showered, put makeup on, dressed sexy and everything It feels like I'm back to my old self but an even better enhanced version. People also look way more beautiful and I just wanna kiss & hug everyone. I felt like a hero in my own movie and life is worth living again.

It just makes me sad cause I know if I continue down the path of addiction I will be back to feeling the highs and lows again and my brain starts lying to me by saying have just a little and it won't hurt.

The bar has gotten to pretty much autonomous. I put in <10 hours a week there, mainly office work and general upkeep (both physical space and community relationships). Coffee shop I am still doing about 30-40 hours a week of active labor inside the space. 

I'm looking for another partially passive revenue stream and found a 2 acre empty lot for sale in my city for $60k. No structures currently on site, about ~.5 of an acre of the total is lightly wooded but it is all flat. The parcel is already fenced and gated with security cameras. Electric and plumbing hook ups at the property line. 

I'm debating the possibility of putting in storage units or maybe more niche ones (RVs, motorcycles, etc. ). I could put down 20k semi uncomfortably, $10k comfortably. 

Would love any advice, experiences, stories from anyone with experience in this area! Have a friend who would be interested in partnering, so I am also curious if this size lot would be profitable enough for a 50/50 split.

1kc73ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1kc73ps/the_rise_of_plantbased_restaurants_worldwide/,"""The Rise of Plant-Based Restaurants Worldwide""","It began, as most revolutions do, not with a bang, but with an aggressively cheerful kale salad and a server named Sage who wore linen pants and spoke in reverent whispers about jackfruit. I sat there, dazed, fork in hand, staring into a dish that looked like the compost bin. This wasn’t food. This was penance with a garnish.

Everywhere I turned, plant-based restaurants were sprouting like well-watered weeds, overtaking cities, towns, airports, and eventually, I assume, my nightmares. They weren’t just serving food, they were on a mission. You don’t “eat” at these places, you embark on a moral journey guided by someone named Willow who explains, in painful detail, why your burger was crafted from lentils and mushrooms. She smiles as if she’s saving your soul.

I wasn’t always this broken. I used to believe in the right to butter. I walked proudly into diners where grease was part of the décor. I licked the bones of my convictions clean and slept the peaceful sleep of the protein-sated. But then came the onslaught. The vegan onslaught. A wave of righteous greenery sweeping across the land with tofu swords raised high and almond milk dripping from their chinless mouths.

They say plant-based cuisine is the future, and by “they,” I mean the disciples of chickpea gospel who will stab you in the kneecap with a bamboo fork if you so much as glance at a veal chop. These people have power now. Real power. They’ve infiltrated menus, corrupted bar snacks, and turned whole food courts into sanctuaries of beet hummus and cashew-based cheese spreads. The steak has become an endangered species in these parts. Somewhere, a cow sheds a relieved tear. Meanwhile, I weep for flavor.

I found myself in a plant-based restaurant overseas. One of those smug global hubs where the table water has notes of cucumber and judgment. The menu was a fever dream of verbs and vegetables. “Massaged kale.” “Activated almonds.” “Deconstructed lentil loaf with an emotional reduction of regret.” I asked for bacon. The server didn’t laugh. She just blinked, as though I’d requested to club a seal tableside.

The food arrived on a slab of slate the size of a license plate. My entrée was a tower of things that used to be plants, now processed into shapes and colors found only in aggressive modern art. The sauce was “nutritional yeast foam,” which sounds like something that forms when your bathtub hasn’t been cleaned in three weeks. I poked it with my fork and it hissed.

I wanted to run, to dive headfirst into the arms of a cheeseburger and beg for forgiveness. But I was trapped. Surrounded by bamboo chairs, Edison bulbs, and the low murmur of diners nodding solemnly over their kale medallions. This was no longer just a meal, it was a cult, and I had been inducted by accident. I tried to protest. “Where’s the meat?” I asked. A man at the next table stared into my eyes and whispered, “The meat is a lie.”

They told me I’d feel better. Lighter. Cleansed. All I felt was a gnawing hunger that could only be sated by something that once mooed. I left that night, not walking, but drifting and carried away by the wafting aroma of seared portobello and smugness. My clothes smelled of turmeric. My soul itched.

The rise of these restaurants has been swift and merciless. One minute, tofu was a punchline. Now it’s the centerpiece of upscale bistros with names like “Thyme & Grace” or “Rooted.” You can’t even order a pizza anymore without someone asking if you want the crust made of cauliflower and your mozzarella replaced with a cashew paste that tastes like old lotion. This is culinary tyranny disguised as wellness.

And yet, it’s spreading. Across continents, into corners of the world that once prided themselves on their unapologetic embrace of flesh and fat. Now, they too fall in line. Even the street food vendors are getting nervous. A man in Southeast Asia once proudly handed me a skewer of mystery meat. Now, he whispers about tempeh and offers me a jackfruit taco wrapped in a banana leaf. I ate it. I’m not proud.

There’s no escaping it. You walk into an airport lounge and suddenly there’s “vegan pulled pork,” which is a contradiction so profound it should be illegal. You open a menu and get assaulted by terms like “plant-forward,” “earth-to-table,” and “holistic digestion.” You try to order a coffee and end up in a debate over oat versus hemp milk with a barista who wears sandals year-round and smells faintly of patchouli and trauma.

But here’s the thing. Some of it isn’t bad. Some of it is good. There, I said it. The tempeh was crispy. The vegan pho had depth. The beet tartare? Surprisingly sinister in its excellence. It haunts me. I may be broken now, a man who once mocked vegans with the righteous fury of a barbecue pitmaster and now finds himself googling “how to roast chickpeas for crunch.” I don’t know who I am anymore.

Maybe that’s the secret. The rise of plant-based restaurants isn’t just about health or the planet or ethics. It’s about transformation. Forced, slow, kale-fueled transformation. The food changes you. Not just physically, but on a cellular level. One day you’re scoffing at quinoa. The next, you’re arguing about seitan texture with a stranger in a farmer’s market while sipping beetroot kombucha and questioning your existence.

I am not proud of what I’ve become. But I’m here. Eating lentils. Whispering apologies to animals I never met. Filling my plate with root vegetables and shame. The war is over. The plants have won. And I’m standing in the ruins of my former self, holding a bamboo spork and wondering what the heck happened.

I'm using Beaumont beans at the moment but wondered what everyones recommends from a bean perspective & whether you find the recommended grind to be accurate or whether you lower/increase and ignore the recommendation, my machine recommends 12 for the grind on a double shot currently.

Again, we are completely new to this overall so any recommendations on anything relating to the machine & coffee in general would be welcome 😃

Hello! This time, we'll be announcing Wave 4 launch date and changes that will be happening after Wave 4 in regards to gaining Closed Beta access. Let's get started!

‍

# Wave 4 is starting on 15th of May 12:00 UTC+0

With the smart watch testing now underway, we found some critical issues & crashes, but for the most part it's been smoother than we expected. The only thing now remaining is fixing these issues, some polishing touches and fixing the inaccuracies in steps graphs.

We expect that we can have all of this done before 15th of May, so that's when we'll open the Wave 4 at 12:00 UTC+0.

**The wave will close on 8th of June at 23:59 UTC+0.**

‍

# Getting guaranteed access to Wave 4

If you want to gain guaranteed access to Wave 4 and start playing immediately when it has opened, you can [support us](https://walkscape.app/support) which gives you immediate access. Any new supporters during the Wave 4 will also gain access immediately. We will be accepting people who have applied to the Closed Beta from [WalkScape Portal](https://portal.walkscape.app) throughout the wave as well.

‍

# Changes for new supporters after Wave 4

​​

[Changes coming into effect after Wave 4](https://preview.redd.it/zoxmu1gcu5ye1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=7345271561ba8e5d4c9f0ae195e6d47fe753e9ac)

There will be changes to the benefits and pricing for supporting WalkScape that will come into effect for **new supporters** after Wave 4. Existing supporters will not be affected by any of these changes.

**Changes to new supporters after Wave 4**

* **All supporters, at any tier, will always be granted immediate access to the Closed Beta without needing to wait until we accept more players.**
* Walker price is increased from $3 a month to $4.50 a month.
* Serious Walker price is increased from $6 a month to $7.50 a month.
* One time purchase on Buy Me a Coffee will be increased from $3 to $4.50. One time Beer option will be removed.

‍

Pricing and benefits will stay the same for all current supporters and for any supporter who starts supporting before the end of Wave 4.

‍

# Why these changes?

Let's start off by saying that the prices for the Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee have stayed the same since I was still developing this game just on my own all the way from early 2023. At that time, I wasn't thinking that these prices would eventually be something we would run a business with and pay wages to multiple people.

These changes don't come lightly or out of greed, and I want to make it clear. I've tried to apply for government grants ([Business Finland](https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/for-finnish-customers/services/funding)) now for **four times**, because if we would've gotten a grant we wouldn't have needed to touch the pricing. Sadly, my applications for getting a grant for the company have been denied each time, main reason being that we don't have any investors backing the project. And we don't want investors, because that could risk the integrity of the game - investors could start seeking for quick returns, and pressure us to make changes that could ruin the game. We've been offered investments multiple times, but I've turned them down each time because I know that as long as I stay as the sole stakeholder, there will be no risk of [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification).

With the money that we currently get from Patreon & Buy Me a Coffee, we've been able to pay the wages and all of the other expenses, but we are breaking even. In addition between waves, there are often cancelled or charged back subscriptions, which means our income decreases. Due to this, I often have to cut my own compensation between the Waves.

This has been all good so far, but as everyone has probably noticed, things have gotten increasingly expensive in the last couple years. That hasn't just made it sometimes a struggle to have enough money in personal life to get by, but all of the bills our company pays have also increased.

‍

# Our goals with the changes

The goals we aim to achieve with these changes are:

* Gaining immediate access by supporting outside of a wave could stabilize our finances when there is no on-going wave.
* If we could turn a profit each month, we can start saving this money for Open Beta release. We expect that Open Beta launch will burn a lot of money (server scaling, transitioning from Patreon/BMAC to subscription model, marketing, etc.).
* If we could increase revenue significantly (from current $12k-ish per month to around $17k a month, after taxes, currency exchanges & platform fees) we could hire one more developer.

I want to stay fully transparent about anything related to these changes, and any future changes as well if there will be some. I will answer any comments, questions, suggestions or feedback you might have on this in the comments!

‍

# Until next time

That's all for today! I will answer any questions, feedback and suggestions in the comments and on our Discord server.

I want to also thank all of our current supporters, beta testers and members in the community for being patient with us. It's been a long road to Wave 4, and finally we're so close to it! I hope everyone new will enjoy the game.

Lately, there’s been a shocking, never-before-seen phenomenon sweeping the internet: people using ChatGPT… to ask questions. Wild, right? Sometimes even more than once a day! We’ve now reached the critical threshold where typing a single thought into a chatbot is considered a global crisis.

Yes, we get it: ChatGPT generates text based on patterns and probability. Wow! So insightful! But do we really need to keep testing it by asking “write a poem about my cat but make it Shakespearean” for the 14th time this hour? Groundbreaking stuff. You’ve changed the game. Society thanks you for your service.

But here's the thing: every prompt you send, no matter how totally unique your ""turn this breakup into a corporate resignation letter"" request is, burns energy. That adds up, y'know. Each reply is powered by servers that use electricity—real, tangible watts—enough to maybe brew a cup of coffee or toast a piece of bread. Now multiply that by the millions of times people ask it to “act like a tsundere anime girl” or “summarize Shrek like a legal brief.”

Suddenly, we’re staring down the barrel of a full-on existential power crisis… all because Chad needed ChatGPT to write him a quirky Tinder opener that still somehow bombed.

So here’s a super simple ask: maybe it’s time to let the ChatGPT trend go. Not forever. Just long enough for the planet to catch its breath… or until we invent solar-powered sarcasm.

1kc6wap,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1kc6wap/i_seem_to_have_a_problem_with_openness_that_is/,I seem to have a problem with openness that is linked to (perceived) loyalty.,"(F23) I'm in deep reflection mode today, and so I felt like posting here.

So as I'm reflecting on my behavioral patterns and attachment style over the years, I'm noticing that besides my chronic introversion, I've had a huge barrier with openness for some reason. And im not referring to enjoying being alone. If I'm placed in a group or want to socialise I can do that absolutely fine, but there's something in me that is never fully present and just tells me not to invest. Keep it small talk over the weather and unimportant chitchat and go home. For some reason -as nonsensical as it may sound- I find this being linked to my lingering sense of loyalty, ever since I was dating my childhood love in high school. Being an introvert I always found myself wanting my focus to be on one-on-one hangouts, be it with him or even with my friends. I prefered walks or coffee afternoons with x friend on x day. If we met all 5 together it would make me uneasy (despite all of us being friends and knowing each other our whole lives).

Later on, I got into a long-distance relationship with someone overseas, and I was truly invested in it. I didn't entertain another the whole time we had this going on and I would lower my gaze/ decline any opportunity that came my way. The thing is, this happened while I started university, and I missed out on valuable connections and networking big time due to being energetically closed off (even on a friendly level with colleagues, im not talking romantic). The person did not demand it from me, but I felt a sense of duty/loyalty and was fully absorbed in their orbit. It automatically made me uninterested and avoidant, bothered by social interactions and overly bubbly folks who were extroverted, happy-go-lucky and wanted to make new friends.

Seeing where I'm currently at in life, I feel I no longer have this blockage (at least not to the extent I used to). I want to meet and interact with people (in moderation though, not full day of oversocialising in large crowds), yet I kind of fear that I will become too immersed in them, as I tend to love people deeply and place  connections in very high regard. I guess this is another reason that has triggered my fearful avoidance. I feel unease with the idea of impermanence, that they are only going to be here for a certain season in my life and then we'll never speak again after graduating, or that we'll only date for as long as we live in the same city and then bye, go separate ways in life, never knew you never knew me ... This whole thing has made me not want to invest in things deeply anymore, keep it short, occupy myself with uni workload, hobbies, interactions being casual surface level and thus nobody gets hurt and we're perfectly fine. 

Am I overthinking this? Should I honour every connection regardless of the outcome or my fears? Should I let myself fall in love when there's so much uncertainty, impermanence, moving, travel involved and just live in the moment? Should I keep it typical with everyone and keep them at arm's length? Thoughts?",1,1746100617.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

each time he’s eaten since coming home he has almost immediately had diarrhea. it doesn’t seem to be as severe as before, he has no fever as far as i’ve checked, headache, i’m not sure if he still has hot flashes, but he’s just been sleeping. i have him on pedialyte, water, and taking pepto / imodium as needed.

Spoiler: *today wasn’t one of them.*

After months of scrolling through Twitter and Reddit, seeing people post “just made my first dollar online,” while I was still struggling to get over 100 active users on one of my “apps” (let’s be honest, more like prototypes on life support), something different happened this morning.

I woke up with the usual mindset: *I don’t expect shit from this digital life anymore, but I keep going, out of habit or maybe desperation.* I opened my laptop, logged into Stripe… and saw a payment. And yeah, my brain instantly short circuited.

“Is this a prank?”

“Is Stripe wishing me a late happy birthday?”

“Did ChatGPT start a pity fund for me?”

But nope. No joke, no glitch.

Because that Stripe notification felt like a pat on the back saying:

“Hey, maybe you’re not completely wasting your time. Maybe you’re actually building something that matters.”

And honestly? It fired me up more than anything has in months. It made me want to fix things, improve stuff, stop procrastinating. (Yes, I might actually become productive. Terrifying)

After months of scrolling through Twitter and Reddit, seeing people post “just made my first dollar online,” while I was still struggling to get over 100 active users on one of my “apps” (let’s be honest, more like prototypes on life support), something different happened this morning.

I woke up with the usual mindset: *I don’t expect shit from this digital life anymore, but I keep going, out of habit or maybe desperation.* I opened my laptop, logged into Stripe… and saw a payment. And yeah, my brain instantly short circuited.

“Is this a prank?”

“Is Stripe wishing me a late happy birthday?”

“Did ChatGPT start a pity fund for me?”

But nope. No joke, no glitch.

I never drink caffeine before pandemic time (32yo male). but since 2021 I drink coffee sometimes, not every day.

Since last autumn I opened for myself ""Yerba Mate, I drank it like 2 months every day, but got huge anxiety (I didn't know that dosage should be one portion per day) so I started to take Prozac and quit Yerba since November.

Since January I returned to this drink, and it was every day Yerba Mate fiesta (like 200mg+ caffeine) on 10am and Strong Puer tea on 3pm.

I quit Prozac in March but continued drank Yerba and strong tea to kick low motivation and withdrawal from Prozac (naive, I know). Next I'm so tired of this fake dopamine like ""pleasure from yerba cup"" and I quit any form of caffeine.

Now is cold turkey day 6 and my bowel act so crazy...gases, frequent bowel movements and etc...last time when I had symptoms like this was when I quit weed in 2023 or Escitalopram same year...and now it's really doesn't matter what I eat (I eat healthy food last years), symptoms only go away during sleep, get worse around lunchtime and continue until bedtime.

Mental symptoms like most of withdrawals: anxiety, tremor, panic attacks (only at night), depression, low motivation, low joy, brain fog, DP/DR.

Also I have pain in body and muscles, tinnitus.

I met neurologist and she said this is withdrawal syndrome from Prozac (I didn't tell she about caffeine), I got recipe for Atarax (Hydroxyzine) for month and one nice nootropic.

Any advice will be great from you guys!",2,1746099973.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I have a new La Spaziale mini Vivaldi II that started leaking around the portafilter after about 3 months of use.  I backflush regularly, run some water through the group after every shot, and clean the area frequently with the brush it came with.  I take apart the shower screen and wash it about once a week.
I bought new gaskets from the same place where I bought the machine, and installed one.  I’ve had the shower screen off a couple of times before and put it back with no problem.  Since I put the new gasket in, the PF will not go in with anything like a normal dose of grounds, but will go in when it’s empty.
I got it to go in with a smaller dose (about 2 grams less) but it leaked and squirted coffee everywhere.  Not little squirts, big ones, all over me and counter. I shut it off and am letting it cool down before I take it apart again, but wondering if there is a common mistake I may have made.
I had to drink a k-cup instead so this is an emergency. ",1,1746099949.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I saw this brand in a cafe recently. I got a nitro coldbrew because I don't have a lot of cafes with the on-tap equipment like that, so I don't know if Kuma is what I was served, but they seem interesting.

I can't find a single post on here about them so I figured I put some feelers out there. Weird to see a Seatle roaster with no commentary. Especially with the Japanese influence in the name, and that I live on the East Coast, so its not at all a local brand.

According to the ""[How to Become a Contract Liquor Agent](https://www.com.ohio.gov/documents/liqr_8041.pdf)"" document, ""The Agent must also complete price changes that occur at the first of the month...""

Counts for 5/1/25:

* Number of New Products: 10
* Number of Price Decreases: 255
* Number of Price Increases: 222
* Number of Status Changes: 2 (1 are to De-Listed)

For each category I've sorted by the amount of the price increase or decrease. New products are shown first, then price decreases are shown in decreasing order followed by price increases in increasing order. At the end are products with other changes unrelated to price. There were too many changes to fit in this post so I'll add a reply below with all of the Vodka changes so far.

I plan to use this post to capture other smaller changes that happen during the rest of the month before the big change next month.

Here is the link to what changed last month in [April, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1jpb23i/new_and_changed_products_april_2025_mostly_new/). ~~Be sure to check [the sticky comment on last month's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor) to see what changed after the initial post.~~ I haven't had a chance to go back and capture the changes throughout last month yet.

Current product status is indicated on each line as follows. OHLQ hasn't publicly explained what these things mean but I've included my best guess below.

* A = Active
 * Regularly supplied and available for purchase
* D = De-Listed
 * No longer carried by OHLQ, may still be available in some stores or the warehouse. Sometimes considered a Last Call product
* I = Inactive
 * Discontinued by the supplier or otherwise unavailable to OHLQ
* S = Special Order
 * Regularly available but in limited supply. Not available in very many stores
* V = Value-Added-Pack
 * Bottle comes with some kind of extra gift like a glass/mug/etc

1kc6n2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lelit/comments/1kc6n2v/lelit_pl81t/,Lelit Pl81T,"Hi I just saw a Video about a Lelit PL81T from Golden Bean Coffee on youtube where he shows how to entwr the LCC Settings and change the preinfusion time: 
https://youtu.be/fKkdIMSEoH4?si=wJnJOhZ54Ga0oWtH

I have the same machine however when I enter the LCC menu, I have less Settings I can chage (including the preinfusion setting).

1kc6mtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/True_Love_Cape_Town/comments/1kc6mtt/stories_from_our_friends_the_weight_of_the/,"Stories from our friends > The Weight of the Mountain, The Pull of the Tide","Let the scent of salt and fynbos fill your sunlit mood. We're in Cape Town.

**The Weight of the Mountain, The Pull of the Tide**

Elias knew the moods of False Bay better than he knew his own heart. Each morning, before the tourists clogged Kalk Bay's main road, he was on his small fishing boat, the Sea Biscuit, chasing snoek or yellowtail. His hands, rough as barnacles, bore the map of his life: scars from hooks, calluses from ropes, the deep tan etched by decades under the African sun. He lived alone in a small, damp cottage clinging to the mountainside, the ghost of his wife, Maria, still lingering in the scent of dried herbs and the worn patch on the armchair. Grief had settled on him like the winter mist that sometimes swallowed Muizenberg peak – a quiet, constant presence.

He rarely looked up anymore, not really. The mountain, Table Mountain, majestic and sprawling, was just there, a backdrop to the rhythm of nets and tides. He’d stopped seeing its grandeur, much like he’d stopped seeing the potential for bright colour in his own monochrome existence.

Then came Amina.

She arrived not with the brash confidence of the summer swallows (tourists), but quietly, like the delicate sugarbirds that frequented the proteas. She rented the tiny studio apartment above the Olympia Café, its balcony overlooking the harbour where Elias moored his boat. She was an artist, though she hesitantly called herself a ""doodler."" Her currency was charcoal and watercolour, her obsession, the unique light of Cape Town – the fierce glare off the Atlantic, the soft blush on the mountain at dawn, the diamond-sharp clarity after the Southeaster wind had scoured the sky clean.

Amina carried her own quiet weight. An unspoken past clung to her – a failed exhibition in Johannesburg, a family that didn’t understand her Hokusai-inspired seascapes, a feeling of being adrift. Cape Town was meant to be a reset, a place to find her footing, her vision. She sketched constantly, her fingers often smudged grey, her gaze intense as she tried to capture the soul of the place.

Their first meeting was unremarkable. Elias, hauling a crate of glistening snoek onto the quay, nearly collided with Amina, lost in capturing the chaotic energy of the gulls fighting over fish guts. Her sketchbook tumbled open, scattering pages.

""Sorry,"" he mumbled, his voice gruff from disuse. He stooped, his weathered hands surprisingly gentle as he gathered the drawings. He paused at one – a quick, evocative charcoal sketch of his own boat, the Sea Biscuit, bobbing against the weathered stone wall. He saw it not just as wood and paint, but as something...alive. He saw the way she'd caught the weary resilience in its lines.

""It's... good,"" he said, the compliment feeling rusty on his tongue.

Amina flushed, retrieving her pages. ""Thank you. I'm sorry, I wasn't looking."" Her eyes, the colour of dark honey, met his. They held a flicker of something he recognised: a deep-seated vulnerability, a search for anchorage.

Their encounters became fragments of days. A nod as he went out, a wave as he returned. Sometimes, she’d buy fish directly from him, her questions shy but insightful – about the currents, the names of the seabirds, the stories behind the colourful boats. He found himself answering, sharing bits of his world he thought he’d locked away. He told her about the treacherous beauty of Cape Point, the legend of the Flying Dutchman, the subtle signs that predicted a storm.

She, in turn, showed him her sketches. Not just of the harbour, but of the Bo-Kaap's vibrant houses, the determined faces in the taxi ranks, the way the light fractured through the milkwood trees at Kirstenbosch. She saw things he’d stopped noticing – the resilience in a wind-battered flower, the hope in the eyes of a street vendor.

One blustery afternoon, the Southeaster howling, confining the Sea Biscuit to its mooring, Elias found Amina huddled on her balcony, wrapped in a blanket, sketching the turbulent grey sea. The wind whipped strands of dark hair across her face.

""Coffee?"" he offered gruffly, holding up a chipped mug.

She invited him in. Her studio was small, filled with the scent of turpentine and paper. Sketches were pinned everywhere, a testament to her quiet, fervent observation. They sat in comfortable silence for a while, watching the waves crash against the harbour wall.

""It's beautiful, isn't it?"" she murmured. ""Even when it's angry.""

He nodded. ""The sea gives, and it takes."" The words hung heavy in the air, carrying the unspoken weight of Maria, lost to illness, not the sea, but the loss felt just as tidal.

Amina didn’t pry. Instead, she pointed to a half-finished watercolour on her easel. It was Table Mountain, not as a postcard, but as a complex presence – its harsh rock face softened by cloud, its base bleeding into the sprawling city, hinting at both the beauty and the disparity.

""I'm trying to capture... its presence,"" she explained hesitantly. ""How it watches over everything. The good and the bad. How solid it feels, even when everything else feels like it's shifting.""

He looked at the painting, then out at the real mountain, partially obscured by rain squalls. For the first time in years, he saw it again. He saw the ancient patience, the enduring strength she was trying to convey. He saw how it mirrored the quiet strength he now saw in her.

Their connection deepened, slowly, organically, like fynbos taking root in thin soil. He’d leave a perfect pearly perlemoen shell on her doorstep. She’d leave him a small sketch – his hands mending a net, the specific way sunlight hit his cottage roof. They walked the Pipe Track above Camps Bay, the city glittering below. They shared cheap samoosas from a corner shop in Wynberg. He took her to Dias Beach, a wild, secluded cove accessible only by a steep path, a place he hadn't visited since Maria. Standing there, the Atlantic roaring, he didn't speak of his late wife, but Amina seemed to understand the sanctity of the moment, the space he’d allowed her into.

Empathy flowed between them not in grand declarations, but in quiet understanding. He saw the flicker of doubt in her eyes when she spoke of her art, the way she sometimes ate little, stretching her funds. He started leaving extra fish, claiming it was surplus he couldn't sell. She saw the profound sadness that sometimes settled behind his gaze, the way he’d trace the rim of his coffee mug as if searching for a lost memory. She didn't push him to talk; instead, she painted the Sea Biscuit battling through choppy waves, capturing not despair, but tenacity. A gift he hung in his kitchen, a splash of colour in his muted world.

One evening, watching the sunset paint the sky orange and lilac from Signal Hill, Amina confessed her fear. ""Sometimes I think I'll never be good enough, Elias. That I'm just... chasing shadows.""

He turned, his weathered face serious in the fading light. ""Your shadows have colour, Amina. They have light in them. You see things. Things that matter."" He reached out, his calloused thumb gently brushing a smudge of charcoal from her cheek. It was the first time he’d touched her intentionally. The contact was hesitant, electric.

In that touch, laden with years of unspoken grief and nascent hope, Amina felt seen. Truly seen. Not as a struggling artist, but as someone who perceived beauty in the world, even in its flaws.

And Elias, feeling the slight tremble of her skin beneath his thumb, felt a thawing around his heart, like the first winter rains washing the dust from the landscape. He wasn't replacing Maria, he knew that. He was simply making space, allowing the tide of life, with its potential for new currents, to pull him gently forward.

Their love story wasn't written in dramatic declarations under starry skies. It was etched in shared silence on windy shores, in the understanding glances across a harbour, in the mutual recognition of quiet burdens carried. It was a love built on empathy, as patient and enduring as the mountain that watched over them, acknowledging the weight of the past while tentatively, bravely, reaching for the light of a shared future in the beautiful, complex city they both called home. You felt for them, didn't you? For the fisherman learning to look up again, and the artist learning to trust the light she captured.",1,1746099725.0,True_Love_Cape_Town,0,1.0,False

It’s your **messaging**.

I know that might sting a little, especially after you spent hours (or weeks) crafting something you *know* can help people. But here’s the cold, hard truth:

>**People don’t buy what they don’t understand.**

If your content isn’t making your audience think,  
**“OMG, I NEED THIS,”**  
then chances are… they don’t *get* what you’re selling.

And when people are confused, they don’t click. They don’t buy. They scroll.

# So Why Isn’t Your Offer Converting?

Here’s what I see most often when creators and coaches come to me saying their digital product isn’t selling:

* They’re focusing too much on features, not on transformation.
* They’re listing benefits without using *relatable stories* or *clear outcomes*.
* Their captions sound like a sales pitch — not a conversation.
* They’re not educating their audience — they’re just *announcing* things.

Sound familiar?

The result?  
Confused audience. Dry content. Zero urgency. Low trust. No sales.

# Let’s Fix That: Here’s What to Do Instead

If you want your digital products to fly off the (virtual) shelves, your messaging needs to connect instantly. Here's how to make that happen:

# 1. Talk About the Transformation

Instead of saying “This is a 10-page eBook,” say,  
“This is the exact roadmap I used to land 3 clients in 7 days.”

**Sell the result. Sell the** ***why*****.**

# 2. Use Relatable Stories & Real-Life Examples

People buy from people. Period.  
Show them *why* your offer matters with mini case studies, testimonials, and content that makes them say,  
“Wow… this feels like it was made for me.”

# 3. Educate Before You Sell

Most creators jump straight to “buy now.”  
But people need to trust you first.  
Teach them something simple. Help them understand the *problem* before you pitch the *solution*.

When your audience feels seen and understood — they *convert*.

# The System That Took Me From $0 to $5K in 3 Weeks

I used to struggle with the same thing. Great products, no buyers.  
But when I shifted my messaging, everything changed.

That’s exactly what I teach inside **Low Ticket Millionaires** — my proven system for selling low-ticket digital products *with clarity and confidence.*

You’ll get access to:

* Plug-and-play **caption + hook templates**
* High-converting **ChatGPT prompts** for offers, sales pages, and more
* The **dry-to-irresistible messaging framework**
* Step-by-step strategies I used to scale my digital product biz fast

# Final Word

Your audience isn’t tired of buying.  
They’re tired of unclear offers, copy-paste content, and creators who don’t speak their language.

The moment your messaging clicks — so do the sales.

# Best 32 oz Plastic Cups of 2025: Shop Top Picks Now!

32 oz plastic cups are ubiquitous in modern life, serving as a practical and cost-effective solution for beverages on the go, at parties, and in various commercial settings. Their durability, disposability (or reusability, depending on the type), and versatility make them a staple in households, restaurants, and event venues alike. As we move further into 2025, the market continues to innovate with enhanced materials, eco-friendly options, and improved designs.

This article explores the best 32 oz plastic cups available in 2025, focusing on quality, durability, features, and overall value. We'll dive into the top contenders, offering detailed analyses to help you make an informed decision for your specific needs, whether you're stocking up for a large gathering, running a business, or simply looking for a reliable everyday drinking solution.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and utility of 32 oz plastic cups vary significantly across different brands and models. The best cups in 2025 offer a combination of durability, safety, and convenience.

**Material Composition:** 32 oz plastic cups are commonly made from polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PP cups are generally more flexible and heat-resistant, making them suitable for both hot and cold beverages. PET cups, on the other hand, are clearer and more rigid, offering better presentation for cold drinks but are not suitable for hot liquids. Some brands are now using recycled materials to reduce their environmental impact.

**Wall Thickness:** The thickness of the cup wall directly affects its durability and sturdiness. Thicker walls provide better insulation, prevent crushing, and reduce the likelihood of leaks. High-quality cups typically have a wall thickness of at least 0.5 mm, providing a comfortable grip and resistance to bending, even when filled with heavy liquids.

**Lid Compatibility:** Many 32 oz plastic cups are designed to be compatible with lids, making them ideal for takeout and events. The quality of the lid fit is crucial to prevent spills and maintain beverage temperature. Look for cups that offer a secure, snap-on lid with minimal gaps or looseness. Some lids also feature straw slots for added convenience.

**Clarity and Aesthetics:** For beverages like iced coffee, smoothies, and colorful cocktails, clarity is a key consideration. PET cups generally offer superior transparency, allowing the vibrant colors of the drink to be displayed. The overall design and aesthetics of the cup can also contribute to the drinking experience, especially in commercial settings where presentation matters.

**Stackability:** Efficient storage is essential for both home and business users. Well-designed 32 oz plastic cups should stack neatly without sticking together or toppling over. Features like tapered sides or ridges can improve stackability and reduce the amount of storage space required.

**BPA-Free Certification:** Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical that has been linked to potential health concerns. Ensure that the 32 oz plastic cups you choose are certified BPA-free, especially if they will be used for serving children or for storing beverages for extended periods. This certification provides assurance that the cups are safe for food and beverage contact.

Key features of the best 32 oz plastic cups include:

*   Durable construction
*   Secure lid compatibility
*   Excellent clarity
*   Efficient stackability
*   BPA-free materials

 ## Core Benefits

The advantages of using high-quality 32 oz plastic cups extend beyond simple convenience. They offer tangible benefits in terms of performance, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness.

**Enhanced Beverage Experience:** High-quality 32 oz plastic cups, especially those made from PET, enhance the overall beverage experience by providing excellent clarity and a comfortable grip. The clarity allows the visual appeal of the drink to shine, making it more enticing for consumers. A sturdy construction also prevents the cup from collapsing or bending, reducing the risk of spills and maintaining the integrity of the beverage.

**Improved Convenience and Portability:** The portability of 32 oz plastic cups makes them an ideal choice for on-the-go beverages. Whether it's a smoothie on the way to work, iced tea at a picnic, or water at the gym, these cups allow you to enjoy your favorite drinks wherever you are. Lid compatibility further enhances convenience by preventing spills and allowing for easy transportation in cars or bags.

**Cost-Effective Solution:** Compared to reusable alternatives like stainless steel tumblers, 32 oz plastic cups offer a more cost-effective solution, especially for large gatherings or commercial settings. While the initial investment may be lower for reusable options, the cost of washing, sanitizing, and replacing damaged items can quickly add up. Disposable plastic cups eliminate these costs and reduce the burden on staff in restaurants and event venues.

**Hygienic and Safe:** In environments where hygiene is a top priority, such as hospitals, schools, and food service establishments, disposable 32 oz plastic cups provide a safe and sanitary option. They eliminate the risk of cross-contamination associated with reusable cups that may not be properly cleaned or sanitized. Single-use cups ensure that each user has a fresh, clean drinking vessel, reducing the spread of germs and bacteria.

**Versatile Applications:** 32 oz plastic cups are incredibly versatile and can be used for a wide range of beverages, from water and soda to smoothies, iced coffee, and cocktails. They are also suitable for serving snacks like popcorn, fruit salads, and desserts. Their versatility makes them a valuable addition to any household, office, or event venue.

 ## FAQs Section

Common questions about 32 oz plastic cups often revolve around their safety, reusability, and environmental impact.

**Are 32 oz plastic cups recyclable?**
    Many 32 oz plastic cups, especially those made from PET or PP, are recyclable, but it depends on your local recycling program. Check with your local waste management provider to determine which types of plastic are accepted in your area. Rinse the cups thoroughly before placing them in the recycling bin to remove any residual liquids or food particles.

**Can 32 oz plastic cups be reused?**
    While some 32 oz plastic cups are designed for single-use, others can be reused multiple times if properly cleaned and cared for. Sturdier cups with thicker walls are more suitable for reuse. Wash them with warm, soapy water or place them in the top rack of your dishwasher. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that can scratch or damage the plastic.

**Are all 32 oz plastic cups BPA-free?**
    No, not all 32 oz plastic cups are BPA-free. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical that was commonly used in the production of plastics, but it has been linked to potential health concerns. To ensure your safety, always look for cups that are specifically labeled as BPA-free. Many reputable brands now use alternative materials that do not contain BPA.

**Can I use 32 oz plastic cups for hot beverages?**
    It depends on the type of plastic. Polypropylene (PP) cups are generally heat-resistant and can be used for hot beverages up to a certain temperature. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) cups, on the other hand, are not suitable for hot liquids as they can soften or melt. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to determine the maximum temperature rating of the cup before using it for hot beverages.

My eldest was pregnant with her 1st baby, and after an emergency Caesarian early March, baby had complications and only lived for 1 day. Finally got my head sorted from all of that, as best I guess you can. 

Today, just found out a friend, who was having a hard time after his wife left him 3+yrs ago, and took the kids 1000kms away (which he did approve thinking it was in their best interests to be closer to extended family, forfeiting his own needs), then denied him access to his own kids, has died. Likely self inflicted. He was majorly depressed. The last time I saw him was Sun 20th. We were meant to have lunch, but he was running late, so we had coffee at a cafe instead, then sat in the park to talk more, and finished up with dinner. We msged all last week, up until Thursday, including on that same day an email thanking me for my support for the last 2.5yrs. It wasn’t the first such email, so as much as it should have been obvious, it just raised an eyebrow from me. And we msged more after that, again, Thursday. A string of texts. He def sounded deflated. When I msged Tues 30/4 in the morning to ask about something we’d talked about on the previous Thursday, the msg went thru as “Sent as text msg”. Happened a few times over the yrs, so again, not too alarming. And he’s a workaholic, so occasionally could be too busy to reply. Or have his phone on focus, or off. Then this morning, after no response, I sent another text. Same, “Sent as text msg”. After getting to work and still not hearing anything, I sent an email. Nothing. Tried calling, but it immediately went to “unable to contact” .. not his usual voicemail. Tried again a bit later. Same. Then, not feeling great, I tried his work number. Where I was informed of “unfortunate news”. They couldn’t tell me much, but did say he passed away on Tues 29th. There will be no funeral - he showed me his will late last year and he didn’t want one. “Save the money for the kids”, etc. I don’t get to have a last goodbye. I can’t even find out facts about what actually happened. 

I’m upset because he finally went thru with it. If he did. Tho I can’t imagine anything else would have happened. I’m upset because the last time we spoke, I didn’t know it was the last time. The last coffee. The last dinner. The last chat in real life. The last text msg. The last email. The last time for everything. I’m upset because he knows what my year has been like, and he’s added more to it. I’m upset that he thought this was his only way out. I’m upset that he fought for 3yrs and still ended up in the same predicament. 

And it’s just gone May 1. 1/3 of the year has gone only. 2/3 still to go. ",1,1746099181.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

One reckless kiss to escape a dreadful blind date, and Sybil Garcia's life was turned upside down.

In a coffee shop, with a flick of her wrist and a daring peck, Sybil found herself entangled with the brooding, enigmatic Lowell Hendrix. It was supposed to be a harmless prank, but fate had other plans.

Lowell, the heir of the powerful Hendrix family, was under immense pressure to find a bride to appease his ailing grandfather. And just like that, Sybil was swept into a whirlwind of wealth, power, and deception. The Hendrix mansion gleamed like a beacon of opulence, but beneath its gilded surface lay a web of secrets and schemes. Every smile was a mask, every word a double-edged sword. Sybil's sharp tongue and unyielding spirit were her only weapons as she navigated this treacherous new world. Amidst the chaos, something unexpected happened—she and Lowell began to find solace in each other's company.

# Chapter 1 Her First Kiss

The café's quiet murmur of conversation was cut short by a man's voice, thick with self-importance. ""When we get married, you'll quit your job. Just focus on taking care of our family and me, and give me a healthy baby within the first year.""

Sybil Garcia took in her blind date—a middle-aged man with thinning hair and a belly stretching his cheap shirt.

He was exactly the kind of disastrous man her stepmother Lillian Garcia would set her up with. Each one was pushed as ""a perfect match"", just to make sure Sybil never got a shot at anyone better.

The man had wrinkled his nose at her goth makeup at first, but now his eyes lingered on her slender frame, lips twisting into a leer. ""So,"" he said, leaning in, ""how tall are you?""

Sybil stirred her coffee, her voice flat. ""Five-five.""

The man nodded, looking satisfied. ""Not bad. I'm almost six feet tall, and you're just the right height. You'll have to go up on your toes when we kiss, but I'll bend down to make it easier.""

Sybil had heard that line too many times. Any guy claiming to be ""almost six feet"" was usually stretching the truth by a couple of inches.

Sybil rolled her eyes, her goth makeup making them look extra sharp. ""Sir,"" she said sweetly, ""do you actually know how tall a man needs to be for a woman to go on tiptoe?""

The man frowned, clearly annoyed. ""What are you trying to say?""

Just then, Lowell Hendrix walked into the café, his tall, imposing frame drawing every eye in the room.

Sybil spotted him immediately. A mischievous glint lit her eyes as she strode over. ""Hey,"" she purred, fingers already reaching for his tie. ""Mind being my prop for a second? I need to show something about height requirements to that man.""

Lowell's face grew serious. Before he could react, she yanked him down and rose on her toes, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.

""See?"" Sybil smirked. ""You gotta be at least his height if you want a girl on her tiptoes.""

The man shot up from his seat, finger jabbing the air. ""You... Who just kisses strangers like that? I'll make sure every matchmaker in town hears about this. Good luck getting another date after word gets out.""

Sybil was gleeful. With this scandal, her stepmother would struggle to set her up with any more awful blind dates.

She waved off the sputtering man and flashed Lowell a smile. ""Thanks for being a good sport. Maybe I'll see you around."" Turning on her heel, she started toward the door.

A sudden grip froze her in place—Lowell's large hand clamped around her wrist like an ice shackle. ""You don't just kiss a man and walk away,"" he growled, his voice dangerously quiet.

The chill in his tone ran down her spine. When she turned, she found herself staring at what might be the most unfairly handsome face she'd ever seen—the kind that made people forget what they were saying mid-sentence.

His hair was slicked back perfectly, framing his sharp, model-like features. He carried himself with effortless authority, commanding attention without raising his voice.

Sybil's heart sank. In her haste to humiliate her blind date, she'd grabbed the nearest tall stranger without looking properly. Now, up close, she realized this wasn't just some random guy. There was an undeniable power radiating from him.

Sybil frowned. ""What exactly are you expecting here?""

Lowell's expression turned thunderous. Just as he drew breath to respond, his assistant—a sharp-dressed man named James Hall—appeared at his elbow, phone in hand.

""Mr. Hendrix,"" James said urgently, ""The bad weather forced Ms. Sofia Baker's flight back. She won't make it today. Your engagement party is in a few hours. What do we do now?""

Lowell's jaw clenched. This engagement party wasn't just for show—it was his grandfather Frank Garcia's last hope.

Frank had grown impatient, furious that Lowell was pushing thirty with no wife in sight. The stress had wrecked the old man's heart, and now he needed a transplant urgently.

But Frank was stubborn. He'd only agree to the surgery if Lowell got engaged today and married within three days.

Sofia was supposed to play the part, but she had to drop out at the last minute.

Sybil squirmed in Lowell's grip. ""Can we speed this up? I'd like to leave now.""

Lowell glanced at her, a calculating gleam in his eyes. He then offered a cold, thin smile. ""Since she decided to mess with me, she can take Sofia's place.""

James eyed Sybil and winced. With her smudged eyeliner, tangled hair, and ripped clothes, she looked like she'd just stumbled out of a punk concert. Not exactly the refined image they needed.

""Mr. Hendrix,"" James said, a bit hesitant, ""are you sure about this? She doesn't exactly seem—""

""Enough,"" Lowell cut in, his tone leaving no room for debate.

James swallowed his objections. ""Understood.""

Sybil caught the exchange, suspicion darkening her gaze. ""Take Sofia's place?"" she echoed. ""What exactly are you implying?""

Lowell held her stare, unblinking. ""You're going to fix this,"" he said coldly.

Sybil's eyes widened in disbelief. ""You're joking. Fix what? That was my first kiss. If anyone's talking about damages, it should be me.""

A flicker of interest crossed Lowell's face. ""First kiss?""

Sybil exhaled, a touch of sadness in her voice. ""Yeah. Twenty years of saving it, and I just wasted it on you.""

Lowell had to grudgingly admire her audacity. His expression hardened as he gave a curt nod to his team. ""Take her.""

In seconds, a few dark-suited men surrounded Sybil, steering her efficiently toward a sleek black car waiting outside. Before anyone could blink, she'd gone.

\*\*\*\*\*

Lunara Manor—Lingaston's crown jewel of luxury—was alive with the hum of Lowell's engagement celebration. The cream of society floated through the ballroom, champagne flutes in hand.

""Wonder who the lucky lady is,"" one guest murmured, glancing around.

""Must be some blue-blooded beauty,"" another added. ""Mr. Hendrix wouldn't settle for anything less.""

A sudden gasp cut through the chatter. ""He's here! Oh my, he's hot!""

""Wait, is she the fiancée?"" a guest snorted, eyeing Sybil. ""Looks like she crashed here straight from a mosh pit.""

Lowell led Sybil—who looked utterly out of place—to center stage, every head turning in disbelief. She was not the polished socialite they'd expected.

The host cleared his throat into the microphone. ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mr. Hendrix's engagement celebration.""

Sybil's nails dug into her palms. She knew she'd provoked the wrong guy, and she was ready for his retaliation—legal trouble, public humiliation, anything. But getting dragged into a fake engagement shocked even her.

# Chapter 2 Engagement Ceremony

The crowd buzzed with whispers.

""That can't really be his fiancée,"" a guest hissed, staring at Sybil. ""She looks like she should be headlining a punk show.""

""I always pictured Mr. Hendrix with some society princess,"" another murmured, ""not this... rebellious type.""

""Guess he's got some... interesting taste in women,"" someone else added.

Sybil had deliberately dressed to shock—her usual strategy for scaring off those terrible blind dates Lillian arranged for her.

Now the engagement scene buzzed with scandalized whispers, but Lowell seemed totally unfazed. He observed the scene with detached amusement, utterly unbothered by the judgmental stares.

With the cold press of steel between her shoulder blades, Sybil had no choice but to slide the ring onto Lowell's finger. They performed the engagement ritual under the curious gazes of the guests.

As the host concluded the ceremony, the guests clapped more out of respect for Lowell than understanding of his unconventional choice.

Sybil didn't wait for the final claps. She turned to leave, only to find three women blocking her exit. Their expensive dresses shimmered as they formed a perfect barrier.

""Who are you exactly?"" one of them demanded.

""Why are you dressed like that?"" another sneered.

""You actually think you belong with Mr. Hendrix?"" the third woman sneered, her voice thick with contempt.

Sybil attempted to slip past, but they moved as one unit, cutting off her escape.

Sybil was losing her patience. She glanced at their flashy outfits and quipped, ""Look who's desperately trying to look worthy of him. But does he even recognize you guys?""

One reckless kiss to escape a dreadful blind date, and Sybil Garcia's life was turned upside down.

In a coffee shop, with a flick of her wrist and a daring peck, Sybil found herself entangled with the brooding, enigmatic Lowell Hendrix. It was supposed to be a harmless prank, but fate had other plans.

Lowell, the heir of the powerful Hendrix family, was under immense pressure to find a bride to appease his ailing grandfather.

As a coffee lover who enjoys experimenting with different brews, the flexibility of this machine caught my attention immediately. It’s marketed as a two-in-one coffee maker, and it really lives up to that claim. You can brew your coffee using K-cup pods or your favorite ground coffee, thanks to its reusable filter. Being someone who switches between a quick pod coffee on rushed mornings and experimenting with beans on slower weekends, this feature feels like a little gift to my indecisive coffee habits.

**Practical Design Meets Compact Efficiency**  
The compact design is absolutely a lifesaver if, like me, you don’t have the luxury of sprawling kitchen counters. Its dimensions (11""D x 5.3""W x 11""H) are small enough to ensure I don’t have to play “rearrange the kitchen” every time I need counter space. Additionally, its travel mug compatibility is a win for my hurried mornings. It comfortably fits mugs up to 6.7 inches tall, which means I don’t have to awkwardly tilt my tumbler to catch a full brew.

[Looking for KIDISLE KC311 deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dk2xhsr4/)

**Customization and Speed: A Perfected Brew at the Push of a Button**  
What stands out most about the KC311 is its dual brewing options for hot and iced coffee. My teenage cousin often joins me for iced coffee sessions, and this feature ensures we don’t need expensive coffee shop runs for her vanilla iced latte addiction anymore. The “Bold” setting is a dream for anyone craving a stronger flavor, giving that rich punch to start your day. And yes, iced coffee actually comes out tasting refreshing, rather than watered down—a common gripe with some machines. 

The quick, one-touch brewing operates as advertised, spitting out a fresh cup in mere minutes. Whether my day requires a slow morning with French roast or a quick caffeine dose before errands, this coffee maker keeps up like a pro.

**Highlights**  
- Offers both K-cup pod and ground coffee brewing functions.  
- Features specific “Bold” and “Iced” coffee settings for tailored preferences.  
- Space-saving design fits even the smallest kitchens.  

**Self-Cleaning and Descaling? Yes, Please!**  
About a week in while using the KC311, I began fiddling with its self-cleaning function, and…it works. Unlike some “self-cleaning” features that feel purely decorative, this one could actually save your coffee’s taste after prolonged use. The descale reminder is also timely (triggered after 150 uses), sparing me from the guesswork involved in maintaining brewing efficiency. All you need to do is press and hold the “Iced Coffee” button for three seconds to start the cleaning process. This little bit of automation feels refreshingly modern without overcomplicating things.

**Areas of Concern**  
While the coffee maker has proven to be an asset to my daily brew routine, there are a few areas worth mentioning:  
- The water reservoir could’ve been slightly larger; it requires frequent refills for multiple rounds of coffee.  
- Lack of multiple color choices. The grey is sleek, but options for buyers into brighter shades wouldn’t hurt.  
- The single-serve nature means it’s not ideal for larger families or gatherings.  

**Competing Options in the Market**  
Comparing it to market peers like Keurig K-Classic and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the KC311 holds its ground well. Here’s what shines: the KC311’s self-cleaning mode and bold/iced coffee features feel more intuitive and functional than the alternatives. However, competitors like Keurig offer larger water reservoirs, which can simplify life when you’re in the mood for endless cups of coffee. But in terms of compactness and tidiness, the KC311 is a clear winner hands down. If countertop clutter gives you nightmares, this product might just be your hero.

**Smart Spending**  
When I look at price versus performance, the KC311 punches above its weight. You’re getting stellar flexibility, quick brewing, and a space-saving design for what feels like impressive value. It seamlessly fits into the lives of solo coffee drinkers or small households without breaking the bank. Sure, it trades off a little capacity for its compact size, but for anyone with a minimalist flair or a small kitchen like mine, the balance feels right.

1kc6ct4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1kc6ct4/not_for_profit_but_for_consumer_goods/,"Not for profit, but for consumer goods?","Hey all.

I'm working on a project that considers whether we can gently hack the current consumer model (call it capitalism if you like) so that when we buy stuff at the shops, the profit created is redirected to climate initiatives instead of making the execs and shareholders at Nestle or Unilver etc. a little rich than they were yesterday. 

We're talking rum, chocolate, coffee, tea - that kind of stuff - anything that's ultimately a commodity with a ton of marketing sprinkled on top. 

I'd love to know people's thoughts - it feels like such a no brainer to me - we need to buy this stuff anyway, if we can make products that taste great, look great and are the same price as the market leaders and make them available where you already shop then it's a win-win! Bake in some uniquely radical transparency (such as letting anyone log in to your online accounts so they can track every penny) and we could be on to creating a fairer, more balanced form of commerce?

We are already trading our goods and giving profit away, it's small amounts at the moment - but here's the theory:

**The Problem**

1) We all want to live on a planet where nature thrives and the climate is under control.

2) To get there, groups like the Wildlife Trusts, Rewilding UK and Client Earth need lots of cash to fix the big problems. *(Yes, it's a UK project but applicable worldwide).*

3) Governments and big corporations won’t release the funds so we need to grasp the initiative ourselves.

**The Opportunity**

1) The global trade in packaged consumer goods is worth $77tn per year

2) Companies like Diageo and Nestle create billions of profit ($4.4bn and $11bn net, respectively) by outsourcing production that's backed by multimillion-dollar marketing support.

3) Using our decades of industry knowledge, we can access the same manufacturing and supply chains to create market-leading products with minimal investment that appeal to a generation of ethical shoppers. 

4) By keeping overheads uniquely low and by adopting a radically transparent business model we can drive trust and create profit very quickly.

As an example of our impact, our £24 bottle of vodka has a blended net cash margin of £5.31- 100% of which we use to fund climate initiatives. If we sold as many bottles as Absolut vodka, we would create £790m of funding per year.

  
I've done a bunch of work around how we can fund this, how we ensure the products are ethically produced and are as sustainable as possible, how we can use social love to bypass the need for big $$$ marketing budgets, and how we can license the IP to other founders so they can launch products under the same banner in their own category and territory - I can share more if anyone's interested. 

What do you think - can we gently screw with capitalism while no one is watching? Can we create a system that fights for us instead of just sprinkling more petrol on the flames!

One tagline we're working on - **The money to fix the planet is out there, we just need to take it back!**

Cheers - @ Evrythng\_cc

1kc6aip,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogger/comments/1kc6aip/how_to_maintain_your_perfect_smile_after_cosmetic/,How to Maintain Your Perfect Smile After Cosmetic Dental Treatment,"# Dental treatment in Pune

Your perfect smile achieved through cosmetic dental treatment is an investment in your appearance and confidence. However, keeping those beautiful results requires continuous care and maintenance. Whether it be teeth whitening, veneers, dental implants, or orthodontics, dental hygiene and lifestyle habits are essential to keeping your smile bright and healthy for the rest of your life. In this blog, we will look at ways to keep your perfect smile shining after its cosmetic treatment.

# 1. Follow Proper Oral Hygiene Practices

Good oral health is the basis for a lasting beautiful smile. Here are a few critical habits to develop as part of your daily routine:

* **Brush Twice a Day:** Using a toothbrush with soft bristles and fluoride toothpaste, you should wipe gently over your teeth to avoid the deposition of plaque.
* **Floss Daily:** Flossing is a method of cleaning food debris and plaque in between two teeth, thereby protecting them against decay and disease.
* **Use an Antibacterial Mouthwash:** It also destroys bacteria, refreshes the breath and prevents infections.

# 2. Avoid Staining Foods and Beverages

Specific types of foods and drinks need to be avoided, especially after undergoing teeth whitening or having had porcelain veneers fitted. Some of these foods include:

* Coffee, tea, and red wine
* Dark-colored sodas and fruit juices
* Tomato-based sauces and curries
* Berries and soy sauce

If these types of foods do get consumed, rinse your mouth afterward with water or drink them with a straw to reduce the contact with your teeth.

# 3. Regular Dental Checkups and Cleanings

Checkups for cosmetic dental work must be done in routine dental visits as these are important for preserving its beauty. These checkups should be done every six months for various reasons:

* To detect any problems at an early stage.
* To have the teeth professionally cleaned to remove plaque and tartar.
* Make sure dental restorations such as veneers, crowns, or implants are kept in good shape.

# 4. Protect Your Teeth from Damage

To preserve your smile, take precautions to prevent unnecessary wear or damage:

* **Wear a Nightguard:** If you grind your teeth at night ([bruxism](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10955-teeth-grinding-bruxism)), a custom nightguard can prevent damage to veneers, crowns, and natural teeth.
* **Avoid Hard or Sticky Foods:** You may find that biting down on ice, chewing hard candies, or using your teeth to open packages will damage your restorations.
* **Use a Mouthguard for Sports:** If you’re involved in contact sports, a mouth guard may save your teeth from trauma.

# 5. Maintain a Healthy Diet

In your overall health, proper dieting tends to take care of more than your dental well-being. One should eat foods that are rich in:

* Calcium and Vitamin D (for a stronger teeth and bones),
* Fiber-filled fruit and vegetables (helps with the production of saliva and cleans the teeth)
* Lean protein and nuts (for gum health and tissue repair)

# 6. Stay Hydrated

Water is a natural remedy that can be very helpful in washing away food particles and bacteria thereby preventing decay and bad odor in the breath. Besides, a fully hydrated individual will be able to produce enough saliva, which is important in the maintenance of oral health.

# 7. Use the Right Dental Products

Consult your dental expert on the recommended not-to-have products as safe for your type of cosmetic dental treatment. Some examples of helpful need include:

* Non-abrasive toothpaste for veneers & implants and everything alcohol-free mouthwash to protect dental restorations.
* Soft or electric toothbrushes for the gentle but complete cleaning.

# 8. Address Any Issues Immediately

If you notice any discomfort, sensitivity, or damage to your dental work, don’t ignore it. Contact your dentist promptly to address the issue before it worsens.

# Conclusion

Your cosmetic dental treatment has given you a beautiful, confident smile—now it’s up to you to maintain it! By following proper oral hygiene practices, avoiding stain-causing foods, protecting your teeth from damage, and staying on top of dental visits, you can enjoy a healthy and radiant smile for years to come.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best 32 oz cups differentiate themselves through a combination of materials, construction, and design elements. Understanding these features is crucial for choosing a cup that meets your specific needs.

**Material and Insulation:** The quality of the material directly impacts durability, insulation, and taste.

Stainless steel cups, often double-walled and vacuum-insulated, excel at maintaining temperature for extended periods. They are durable, resistant to rust and corrosion, and generally don't impart flavors to beverages. Plastic cups, typically made from BPA-free materials, are lightweight and more affordable but offer less effective insulation and may degrade over time. Glass cups provide a pure taste experience but are more fragile.

**Lid Design and Leak-Proofing:** The lid is a critical component, influencing ease of use and preventing spills.

Look for lids with secure seals and reliable closures. Screw-on lids provide the most robust leak-proofing, while snap-on or slider lids offer convenience but may be more prone to leaks if not properly designed. Consider features like integrated straws, wide mouths for easy filling, and ventilation to prevent pressure build-up with hot beverages. The presence of a silicone gasket usually signifies better leak prevention.

**Durability and Construction:** The overall construction determines how well the cup withstands daily use and potential impacts.

Reinforced bottoms, sturdy handles (if applicable), and thick walls contribute to increased durability. Stainless steel cups typically offer the best resistance to dents and scratches, while plastic cups may be more susceptible to damage. Glass cups require careful handling due to their inherent fragility. Check customer reviews for insights into real-world durability.

**Ease of Cleaning:** A cup that is easy to clean promotes hygiene and convenience.

Wide-mouth openings facilitate thorough cleaning, allowing access to all interior surfaces. Dishwasher-safe components simplify the cleaning process, especially for busy users. Cups with minimal parts and smooth surfaces are generally easier to clean than those with intricate designs or numerous crevices. Some materials, like stainless steel, are also more resistant to staining and odor retention.

**Ergonomics and Grip:** A comfortable grip enhances the user experience, especially when carrying a full cup.

Contoured shapes, textured surfaces, and strategically placed grips improve ergonomics and prevent slippage. Some cups feature handles for added convenience, while others rely on the overall shape and material to provide a secure hold. Consider the weight and balance of the cup, especially when full, to ensure comfortable carrying.

 ## Core Benefits

Owning a high-quality 32 oz cup provides numerous benefits, impacting hydration habits, convenience, and overall well-being.

**Improved Hydration:** A 32 oz cup encourages increased water consumption throughout the day. Having a large, readily available source of water makes it easier to meet daily hydration goals, leading to improved energy levels, cognitive function, and overall health. The visual reminder of a full cup can also prompt more frequent drinking.

**Cost Savings and Environmental Friendliness:** Reusable cups reduce reliance on disposable plastic bottles and cups.

This translates to significant cost savings over time, as well as a reduced environmental impact. By choosing a reusable cup, you contribute to minimizing plastic waste and promoting sustainable practices. Many coffee shops also offer discounts for customers who bring their own cups.

**Temperature Retention for Beverages:** Insulated cups keep drinks hot or cold for extended periods.

This allows you to enjoy your favorite beverages at the desired temperature, whether it's a steaming cup of coffee in the morning or an ice-cold beverage on a hot day. This is particularly beneficial for commuters, travelers, and anyone who spends extended periods away from a refrigerator or microwave.

**Reduced Condensation and Spills:** Well-designed cups minimize condensation and prevent spills.

This protects surfaces from moisture damage and prevents messy accidents. Double-walled construction reduces condensation on the exterior of the cup, while leak-proof lids and secure closures prevent spills during transport. This makes the cup suitable for use in a variety of settings, including offices, cars, and gyms.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions ensures informed purchasing decisions.

**Are all 32 oz cups dishwasher safe?**

Not all 32 oz cups are dishwasher safe. Stainless steel cups are generally dishwasher safe, but it's always best to check the manufacturer's instructions. Some plastic cups may warp or degrade in the dishwasher, while glass cups may be susceptible to breakage. Lids often require hand-washing to prevent damage to gaskets and seals.

**How long do insulated cups typically keep drinks hot or cold?**

The duration of temperature retention varies depending on the quality of insulation. High-quality vacuum-insulated stainless steel cups can keep drinks hot for up to 12 hours and cold for up to 24 hours. Plastic cups offer less effective insulation, typically maintaining temperature for only a few hours. External factors, such as ambient temperature, also influence temperature retention.

**What is the best material for preventing odors and stains?**

Stainless steel is generally the best material for preventing odors and stains. It is non-porous and resistant to bacteria, making it less likely to absorb flavors and odors. Plastic cups can absorb odors and stains over time, especially if used for strongly flavored beverages like coffee or tea. Glass is also relatively resistant to odors and stains but is more prone to breakage.

 ## Ideal User Profile

Understanding who benefits most from a 32 oz cup helps guide purchasing decisions.

**Fitness Enthusiasts:** Individuals engaged in regular physical activity require adequate hydration. A 32 oz cup provides a convenient way to carry a large volume of water to the gym, track hydration levels, and replenish fluids during and after workouts. Features like leak-proof lids and durable construction are particularly important for this user group.

**Office Workers:** Staying hydrated throughout the workday is crucial for maintaining focus and productivity. A 32 oz cup allows office workers to keep water readily available at their desks, reducing the need for frequent trips to the water cooler. The large capacity minimizes refills, and insulated cups keep beverages at the desired temperature for extended periods.

**Students:** Students often spend long hours studying and attending classes. A 32 oz cup provides a convenient way to stay hydrated throughout the day, whether on campus, in the library, or at home. Durable construction and leak-proof lids are essential for withstanding the rigors of student life.

 ## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

Choosing the right 32 oz cup depends on individual needs and preferences.

When selecting a 32 oz cup, consider your primary use case, desired features, and budget. Stainless steel cups offer superior insulation and durability, while plastic cups are more affordable and lightweight. Prioritize leak-proof lids, ease of cleaning, and comfortable ergonomics.

Overall, the 32 oz cup is a versatile and practical accessory that promotes hydration, reduces waste, and enhances convenience. Whether you're a fitness enthusiast, office worker, or student, a high-quality 32 oz cup can significantly improve your daily life. While not a perfect solution for all scenarios, its benefits outweigh its limitations for most users seeking a reliable and convenient hydration solution.

I’m a confessed cold coffee enthusiast, and having this product in my kitchen has truly elevated my brewing experience. There’s just something satisfying about waking up to homemade, smooth cold brew coffee. My mornings feel complete with this coffee maker. Keep reading as I dive into its features, functions, and share the highs and a few minor lows of my experience.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that caught my eye about this product was its design. The durable glass carafe encased in BPA-free plastic caging looks modern and fits nicely in the refrigerator door. Even the color, a cool shade of blue, adds charm to my otherwise utilitarian kitchen. The Comfort Grip Handle is impressively ergonomic. Even when full, the carafe feels secure in my grasp, which is quite welcome for someone as clumsy as me! I’ve never had a spill, which makes me trust its sturdy construction that much more.

**Cold Brew Quality**  
The taste this cold brew maker achieves is, quite honestly, impeccable. Every brew has been smooth, rich, and as promised, 65% less acidic than hot brewed coffee. Since I prefer coffee that doesn’t fight back with acidity, this has been a treat. I've experimented with various beans and grind coarseness; the removable fine-mesh filter consistently prevents grounds from slipping into the brew, ensuring it’s grit-free.  

**Uncomplicated Brewing Process**  
Brewing with it is incredibly simple. All you need are coarse coffee grounds (or even coffee bags), water, and patience. Once you let it steep overnight or to your favorite strength, it’s ready to go. Unlike some coffee makers that require me to nervously fiddle with buttons or settings, this one makes enjoying a chilled brew as stress-free as possible. And hey, if you’re feeling experimental, it also handles tea rather well—I’ve brewed iced chai lattes to satisfy a craving.  

[Check Primula B086V1QXNM price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b086v1qxnm/)

**Advantages**  
Here’s what makes this cold brew coffee maker stand out:  
- Effortless brewing process with a manual operation mode.  
- Durable tempered glass that doesn’t feel fragile.  
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleanup straightforward.  
- Reusable fine-mesh filter reduces waste compared to disposable ones.  

**Drawbacks**  
Not everything is perfect, even for something this good:  
- The carafe does retain some coffee oils on the plastic parts, which can stain over time.  
- For first-time users, it doesn’t come with a coffee measurement guide, leaving me to initially play a guessing game with ratios.  
- Extracting all coffee from the grounds can be tricky; while it’s fine for most, I sometimes find leftover liquid in the filter.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this coffee maker to others like the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker or the OXO Brew, the Primula product holds its own quite well. While the Takeya offers a slightly tighter lid seal, the Primula excels with its ergonomic handle design and attractive look. Regarding durability, the OXO model has a bulkier build that doesn't fit as snugly in fridge doors, giving Primula an edge. Each one serves its purpose based on user preference, but the Primula wins me over with its value-for-size and sheer ease of use.

**Smart Spending**  
Would I recommend investing in this product based on its price? Absolutely! While I can’t quote exact figures (because coffee maker prices can sometimes play hide-and-seek with your wallet), it’s clear that the combination of usability, durability, and consistent brewing results makes it worth every penny. I haven’t felt the need to replace or upgrade it since purchase, which speaks volumes about its cost-efficiency. For anyone looking to brew café quality cold coffee without bleeding money on daily takeout, this is a smart purchase.

1kc67ty,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kc67ty,Your Completed Requests: Part 1,"Welcome!! Please make yourselves comfortable and I must thank everyone who made a request for me to write a fic for you!! It did take me a bit of time but we got there in the end!! ♪(๑ᴖ◡ᴖ๑)♪

Now, the requests are still open if you’d like me to write anything for you and please stay as long, or as short, as you’d like to!! The fics will be in the order of the screenshots provided and I hope that you enjoy this post of mine ^ ^ 

This fic was requested by u/sapphire-pyro and what might have happened if Lu Guang hadn’t stalled Vein and let him leave that fateful day. It’s fairly light-hearted and is about Lu Guang and Cheng Xiaoshi going out for a meal with Xia Fei and Vein

You can also find this fic on my AO3 but I hope that you enjoy reading it here!! (๑>◡<๑)

##The Red Lion

Lu Guang knew that as soon as he had entered the pub, he did not want to be there but he had made his decision and this was the result he had been ever so lovingly provided with.

Vein had suggested for them to have a hot pot but Cheng Xiaoshi, being in a whole new Country and only now having time to really enjoy it, wanted to go somewhere more authentic. More British.

With a laugh that boiled Lu Guang’s blood, Vein had no complaints on such a change of plan and phoned Xia Fei to join them on their little meal out with only one off-putting comment.

They had ended up in a dimly lit bar which had sticky floors and oak panelling almost everywhere in sight. The stench of beer lay thick in the air and there was a group of older gentleman enjoying a pint by a rather old looking bar.

They had found themselves at a booth and, much to Lu Guang’s relief, Cheng Xiaoshi had decided to sit next to him and he watched as his friend quickly grabbed at the menu

“Drinks?” Vein prompts with a shake of his coin purse, the money inside clattering together like an annoying bell.

“Beer?” Cheng Xiaoshi asks and, as if asking for the seal of approval, glances at Lu Guang.

“Beer.” Lu Guang echoes with a nod of his head; keeping the amount of time he had to speak to Vein at the bare minimum.

“Any beer in particular?”

“Surprise us!” Cheng Xiaoshi grins and he takes the opportunity to lean into Lu Guang; causing him to tense up and resist the urge to place a hand on the others shoulder. The idea of drinking some mysterious beer from someone he never wanted to see again was almost making his skin crawl with dread but, like a soothing balm, he almost felt comforted by the pressure against his arm.

As Vein left them to make his way over towards the bar, only one thought entered Lu Guang’s mind as Cheng Xiaoshi fiddled with the menu in his hands.

He was going to hate this.

***

Cheng Xiaoshi was enjoying every moment of this surprise meal out!

He would be lying if he wasn't actively pretending not to think about what had happened in the Clinic with Wang Qing and Vein but he didn't want to ruin this moment for his friends! After all, he was used to bottling up memories and throwing them into the vast ocean of his mind; letting them drift afar and out of sight. And the menu he had picked up was a prefect distraction as he had absolutely no idea what was written on it! If he wasn’t aware of the English language, he would have thought the menu was just a bunch of peculiar swiggles.

""Lu Guang."" He sang as he snuggled up against his friend and let out a playful laugh. ""I can't read this at all.""

""And you think I can? I can but what if I didn't?"" He heard the other remark before letting out a sigh and taking the menu from his hands.

""So? What does it say?"" Cheng Xiaoshi asks but, before Lu Guang could respond, he saw as Xia Fei entered the pub and cheerfully joined them at their booth.

""Sorry! Hope I didn't keep you waiting."" The model says with a bow of his head and lets out a sheepish chuckle. ""There was a newcomer so the photoshoot went on for longer than I thought it would. Where's Vein?""

""Getting us beers!"" Cheng Xiaoshi grins before taking the menu from Lu Guang and presenting it to Xia Fei. ""As someone with knowledge of the English language, what does any of this say?""

Xia Fei glances at Lu Guang and catches a hidden pout which made it clear that they had been sulking for some reason or the other. He takes a moment before letting out a hum in thought.

“I’ve only been here a few times so I can’t recommend you anything.” He admits cheerfully. “But, I do know that the classics section of the menu is worth trying!”

“The classics section?” Cheng Xiaoshi echoes with a tilt of his head to which Xia Fei nods his own.

“Yep! It’s got a bunch of different pies, fish and chips, but I wouldn’t go for that unless you’re staying near the sea cause then the fish doesn’t have to travel as far, cottage pie—“

“Cottage pie?” Cheng Xiaoshi blurts out, clearly caught by how the food item had been worded. “There’s no way that a cottage pie is just a bunch of stuff found in a cottage and then stuffed into a pie, right?”

Lu Guang can’t stop the laugh that escapes past his lisps when he hears Cheng Xiaoshi’s panicked words. It was almost ridiculous to believe but this was his roommate and he knew, more than anyone, what they were like.

“If they did that then they wouldn’t be able to sell it.” He manages to remark once he had finished chuckling. “It’s a dish consisting of mince beef, peas, carrots and onion with mashed potato on the top layer. I think the sauce is some kind of tomato puree.""

""Bingo!"" Xia Fei grins and, like he had just won a prize in a game show, gestures towards Lu Guang. ""Used to have it loads as a kid but it never tasted that nice so it's up to you if you want to try it or not.""

""Maybe not."" Cheng Xiaoshi states before the trio begin to discuss what they were thinking about eating and, after a few minutes, Vein re-joins them with one of the bar staff who was effortlessly holding four drinks; two in each hand.

""Hope I didn't miss too much while I was stuck at the bar."" Vein muses before taking a seat; watching as the waitress carefully placed each glass on the table before walking off.

He pushes the more fruity looking drink in front of Xia Fei and Cheng Xiaoshi's eyes almost seemed to light up with curiosity as he gazed at the unknown drink.

""It's a fruit cider."" Xia Fei explains before he could ask what the contents of the drink were. ""I texted boss before I got here to get me one since I haven't had one in a while! It's nice!""

""What flavour is it?""

""Well, it's called dark fruits. Think it’s made with blackcurrant and blackberries. Want to try some?""

""I shouldn't."" Cheng Xiaoshi replies but the look in his eyes tells another story. Normally he would just drink beer and call it there but now he had the chance to try something different and he really didn't want to let this opportunity pass him but-

""You sure?"" Xia Fei playfully muses before pushing the glass closer to him. ""I haven't drank any yet if that's what you're worried about.""

Cheng Xiaoshi rapidly shakes his head as he waves his hands. ""That's not it at all! I was just trying to decide on whether I should try some and not because I was worried about sharing a drink with a really awesome model or anything! Thought never even crossed my mind!""

He could feel his cheeks grow warm before the sound of laughter could be heard from the other. He gazes up to see Xia Fei smiling a him and, after taking a breath, takes a sip of the cider. It was bitter but had an interesting flavour to it... Not bad at all! Maybe he really should drink more cider instead of beer!

""Good choice!"" Cheng Xiaoshi beams before picking up the drink and moving it towards Lu Guang. ""Try some of this Lu Guang! It's way better than beer!""

Lu Guang had clearly not expected to be dragged into the conversation as he shuffles away from Cheng Xiaoshi and the beverage; moving towards the corner of the booth and with no way to escape. 

""I don't think Xia Fei would want us to drink all of his drink."" He attempts to explain, already knowing that he wasn't going to like the drink.

""It's fine! I can just get another one."" Xia Fei Muses, unaware of the distress he was causing Lu Guang.

Resisting the urge to laugh when Lu Guang flashes a glare in Xia Fei's direction, Cheng Xiaoshi leans closer with eyes practically shimmering with mischief.

""Coooome ooooon, Luuuu Guang. Just a little sip. For me."" He begs with a wide grin.

""I. Do. Not. Want. To. Drink. That."" Lu Guang replies, emphasising every single word as his back presses his back against the side of the bench; turning his head away as Cheng Xiaoshi holds the drink as close as possible.

""But it's good.""

""No means no, idiot!""

""We should decide on what to eat. After all, the sooner we decide, the sooner we can indulge in the meats this establishment has to offer."" Vein saves Lu Guang just before he is forced to take a sip of the Cider and it was almost amusing to see his expression shift between an array of emotions.

Returning to his spot, Cheng Xiaoshi takes another drink of Cider before finally returning it back to Xia Fei and sheepishly scratches the back of his head.

It doesn't take long before they order a wide range of items off the menu. From multiple different types of pies, an all day breakfast, chunky chips and a sirloin steak for Vein who had chosen to have it done blue; stating that it was the only way to truly enjoy the cut of the meat without it tasting overcooked.

While waiting for their food, the discussion returns back to cider and Cheng Xiaoshi finds himself listening to Xia Fei as he explains the different types you can get from the flavour to the branding.

""So, what would you recommend to us?"" Cheng Xiaoshi asks curiously, gesturing to both himself and Lu Guang.

""Well, I don't think Lu Guang likes cider so I wouldn't recommend him any unless it's served with lemonade. As for you, I'd pick either berries and cherries or blood orange cider.""

""Blood Orange?"" Cheng Xiaoshi echoes. ""Why's it called that?""

""No idea!"" The model admits with a chuckle. ""Sounds kinda ominous but it's actually pretty popular.""

""You sure know your drinks."" Vein chimes in with a playful smirk spread across his face. ""Is there something you haven't been telling me perhaps?""

""It's because of my previous job!"" Xia Fei states with a pout, his cheeks dusted with a shade of red which could have either been caused from the alcohol or was a reaction to Vein’s choice of words. “You’d know all too well if I was drinking too much.”

***

Just as the conversation comes to a lull, the many plates of food begin to arrive and, even though they had been warned that the plates were scolding hot, Cheng Xiaoshi almost immediately touches one of them and promptly suffers the consequences of his actions.

Alongside their order came a couple portions of gravy and a few side dishes filled with vegetables, roast potatoes and cauliflower cheese. 

Lu Guang got to work cutting each pie into four even slices and carefully attempted to plate everything so that the filling didn't immediately spill out of the casing although... That was easier said than done.

When he had managed to get the job done and portion everything out while leaving some for people to just help themselves with, this resulted in the rest of the party giving him a round of applause; much to Lu Guang's embarrassment.

""Now, while it's not as fresh as the duck we had earlier, this steak really is almost as tender as your flesh."" Vein comments as he slices into the steak he had ordered for himself. ""It just melts in my mouth.""

""Really?"" Xia Fei replies after letting out a nervous laugh. ""I thought it'd taste pretty tough since you got the sirloin cut.""

""You know me."" Vein smirks as he carefully cuts another section of steak. ""I know my meat all too well.""

With another reluctant chuckle, the model turns his attention onto Cheng Xiaoshi's plate which had food from every plate; Vein had even let him take a little bit of his steak.

“Have you had that before?” Xia Fei gestures at the section of baked beans on the side of Cheng Xiaoshi’s plate and is rewarded with a shake of the young man’s head.

“I heard that it’s a delicacy here so I can’t not eat it!” He muses before taking a large spoonful and shoving it into his mouth.

It quickly became clear that Cheng Xiaoshi regretted his decision and after forcing the baked beans down with a panicked drink from his beer, he silently scrapped the food onto Lu Guang’s plate; ignoring his roommate as they stared at him.

The silence only lasts for a few moments before Xia Fei bursts into a fit of laughter. 

“Just because something’s called a delicacy, doesn’t mean it’s going to taste nice!” Xia Fei manages to say through his giggles. “I for one can’t stand baked beans. It’s that sauce they’re with. It’s just so… yucky!”

Cheng Xiaoshi lets out an overdramatic gasp as he places a hand over his chest. “But you’re British??? It’s like not on the same level as…” he takes a few moments to think before finally thinking of something. “Not liking tea!!”

Finally managing to halt his laughs, Xia Fei wipes away any stray tears and takes a deep breath in an attempt to ease his excitement however, the alcohol already in his system was making it very difficult to do so. “Now I do need my tea. Especially when I need to stay awake for long period of time.” 

""Do you not drink coffee?""

Xia Fei shakes his head before gesturing to Vein who was more than happy to listen to the conversation at hand. ""Thanks to my boss here, I can't even have decaf.""

""That's because I know you'll put tons of sugar in it."" His boss chimes and before Xia Fei can make a retort, the music goes quiet followed by the sound of someone setting up a microphone in the corner of the pub. There was a slightly raised platform near one of the many booths which had a laptop perched on the edge of the table. It didn't take long before the person sorting out the equipment clears their throat and fully approaches the microphone.

""Welcome to this weeks karaoke night!"" The member of staff declares cheerfully before a set of drunk cheers can be heard in response. ""If you'd like to take part then please come over! Don't be shy! As long as we have the instrumental version of it on that crappy laptop over there then you can sing it!

As people started to get up and make their way over, Cheng Xiaoshi turns his head to Xia Fei with eyes practically shimmering with anticipation; no words had been exchanged but they both knew what the other was thinking. All it took was a nod of Xia Fei's head and the two quickly stumbled out of the booth and towards the member of staff to give them their song selection.

Lu Guang observes the duo and saw Xia Fei interpret what Cheng Xiaoshi was saying to the member of staff operating the laptop. It seemed to take a few attempts but eventually a song was decided upon and they have been added to the list. Happy with the results, they reunite with Vein and Lu Guang with bright smiles spread across their faces and cheeks stained a deep shade of red.

""So, what song did you pick?""

""Don't know!"" Cheng Xiaoshi admits cheerfully. ""But, whatever it is, I'm sure I'll beat everyone here and knock your socks off!""

By the time they had finished as much food as they could eat, they were called to the stage and it was clear that both Xia Fei and Cheng Xiaoshi were drunk.

""This ones for you!"" Cheng Xiaoshi declares to Lu Guang with a wide smile and he watches as they leave the booth, knowing that there was no way Cheng Xiaoshi was going to be able to sing along as well as he thought he could... especially while being under the influence of alcohol.

But, he could tolerate Cheng Xiaoshi's singing. After all, it wasn't the first or last time he would hear it and he had grown used to hearing his roommate sing in the shower... even if Lu Guang had been trying to take a nap at the time.

The only problem was that he was now stuck with Vein and that realisation cast away any sense of ease he had managed to build over their time at the pub.

Those two better not get distracted after their song was done.
 
***

Finding Lu Guang’s clear hatred towards him almost amusing, Vein couldn't help but feel like he was a mouse being observed under the eyes of a cautious cat. It was intriguing to say the least and, like when he had first met Xia Fei, felt different to what he was used to. But, instead of the unadulterated adoration Xia Fei showed while lecturing him about how he said things, Lu Guang's gaze was sharp and held the look of someone who was not afraid to test fate but was smart enough not to make any decisions without a plan.

“So, will you ever tell me what you were going to say earlier?” Vein muses, more than happy to participate in this game.

“Never.” Lu Guang replies, his answer leaving no room for bargaining.

“I think that’s the first time you’ve told the truth since we met.” He recalls, twirling an empty glass around in his hands as the sound of Xia Fei and Cheng Xiaoshi's drunk singing can be heard through the pub speakers.

""I hadn't noticed.""

""You really don't like me, do you?""

""No. I don't.""

The two sit in silence and Lu Guang can't help but feel grateful for Xia Fei as the drunk model drapes himself over Vein; completely distracting his boss from the once tense atmosphere. He turns his attention to Cheng Xiaoshi who stumbles into the table before eventually making it on the other side of the booth and drops his body onto Lu Guang.

""Did you enjoy our singing?"" His drunk friend asks and, after Lu Guang had nodded his head, smiles as if he had been told the best news in the world.

Seeing the pure joy on Cheng Xiaoshi's face caused all other emotions to be washed away by one thought.

Maybe this meal out wasn't so bad after all.

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.

So, I'm a fellow Zyox viewer (although I can't type anything in chat because i have problems verifying my email, TAs in the chat) and as you can tell, i mostly watch a lot of VODs (Archives the goat). 

Well, remember the motto ""you will learn from who you hang out with""? That's exactly what happened to me. Recently i got so brainrotted by the impact of Nick's streams, and so on, i started to say weird things just like him. On my shift i was telling sus jokes, being negatively cringe and one day i even yelled ""Oh my God"", just how our prophet Nicholas Zyonix the third taught us. 

And my coworkers, who are mostly women, seemed to be curious about that behaviour of mine. One day of the women  history month, they were drinking after their shift (even if it's not allowed) and they thought that I'm autistic. To make things even worse, they told our chief not only about my behaviour, but also they told that i am a weirdo and a bad person. And so i got fired, not only fired, but I can't even visit this place as a customer peeposadge

U may ask ""why did u even behave like that?"" Well i certainly can't answer that question bc I don't even know why. I don't blame Nick, he's a very good person with a luscious hair, appreciation for women, stunning vocals and amazing voice acting skills. Just to let you know, i think i should watch this guy a bit less and give some time to other streamers (Zajeff77, as an example)

1kc654o,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kc654o/investigate_how_the_aeitto_nugget_ice_maker/,Investigate how the Aeitto Nugget Ice Maker performs in this detailed review!,"Testing the Aeitto GRY6-CB24M Nugget Ice Maker has been an icy adventure, to say the least. As someone who enjoys chilled drinks like fancy cocktails or even just a crisp soda on a lazy afternoon, having a countertop ice maker seemed like the perfect addition to my kitchen arsenal. While I found the product mostly enjoyable, a few quirks did catch my attention during everyday use. Here's my honest take on this pebble ice machine after several weeks of putting it through its paces.

**Design and Space Efficiency**  
This ice maker is a compact little powerhouse. With dimensions of 12.99 x 7.28 x 12.79 inches, it didn’t take up nearly as much counter space as I expected, sliding snugly next to my coffee maker. The sleek grey design blends seamlessly into modern kitchens—or even office spaces, where I tested it during our weekly brainstorming sessions. Despite its smaller footprint, it can crank out up to 40 pounds of nugget ice in 24 hours, making it an ideal choice for hosters of parties or those with large families. However, it didn’t feel as lightweight as some portable options—almost 20 pounds means you’ll hesitate to move it often.

**Performance and Speed**  
Once I fired this bad boy up, the first batch of chewable ice arrived within five minutes, just as promised. That five-minute claim seemed too good to be true, but it genuinely works! The nugget ice it produces has a soft, chewable texture perfect for pairing with drinks like sodas, cocktails, or even smoothies. My kids absolutely loved chomping on the ice straight out of the basket, turning it into their new favorite snack (yes, they’re weird like that). Over the course of my testing, it kept up during family dinners and hosted gaming nights effortlessly.

[Check Aeitto GRY6-CB24M price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0ddq1cync/)

**User-Friendly Operation**  
I’m no stranger to fiddling with buttons and trying to decipher complicated manuals, but this ice maker’s one-click operation couldn’t have been easier. After filling up the 1-liter water tank, I pressed a single button, and voila—ice magic! The accessories included are thoughtful—a scoop, basket, and even a drip tray for accidental spills or condensation. Additionally, the drainage system worked efficiently, preventing water from pooling disastrously on my counter during testing. However, one small gripe here: the water tank needed refilling more often than I wished, given its compact size.

**Automatic Self-Cleaning Is a Gamechanger**  
Keeping appliances clean can be the bane of anyone’s existence, but Aeitto’s self-cleaning feature made life easier. At the press of a button, the machine gets its insides sparkling without needing much intervention. It ensured every batch of ice smelled and tasted fresh, with no funky aftertaste. Hygienic ice truly became hassle-free. That said, I noticed that occasional manual cleaning was still required to get rid of flecks around the corners of the machine, but that might just be my inner neat freak talking.

**Highlights**  
- Produces delicious, chewable nugget ice perfect for cocktails, sodas, and more.  
- Compact design fits small spaces, from kitchen counters to office breakrooms.  
- Easy-to-use one-touch operation makes ice creation effortless.  
- Self-cleaning function keeps hygiene in check, perfect for daily use.  

**Limitations**  
- The water tank capacity feels too small; frequent refilling could become a chore.  
- Heavier than expected, making it less portable compared to other countertop machines.  
- Didn’t interact as much with recyclable parts, and packaging could’ve been more eco-friendly.  

**Competing Products**  
There’s no shortage of nugget ice makers on the market. The GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker stands as a formidable competitor with its sleek touchscreen controls and Bluetooth connectivity. Its larger water reservoir allows for more ice production without interruptions, which is excellent, but it comes at a steeper price. On the flip side, if you’re on a tighter budget and don’t mind compromising on self-cleaning features, the Igloo Nugget Ice Maker offers solid performance at a lower cost, though its design isn’t quite as refined.

In comparing these, the Aeitto Nugget Ice Maker excels particularly well in its compact design and self-cleaning functionality but falls slightly short in terms of reservoir size and portability. It's the sweet spot for mid-range budgets, giving most of the perks found in higher-end models.

**True Value**  
This ice maker offers a decent trade-off between quality and affordability. You’ll find machines on the market that cost significantly more for the same soft, chewable ice nugget performance. While it demands slightly more monitoring of its water tank and cleaning details, the convenience of having fresh ice so quickly outweighs these small inconveniences. For anyone who prioritizes countertop design and user ease, it’s hard not to appreciate the value packed into this product.

It started as “jokes” but then turned nasty quickly. People were really uncomfortable and trying to change subject/asking her to give it a break. But she kept bitching at him, swearing and insulting him. 

I said I had enough and got up to leave. I picked up my empty paper coffee cup from the table to go and get a drink. I started to trip on the steps of a backpack on the ground by the table and flicked my cup in frustration as I left. The EMPTY cup apparently landed on my sister in law and a TINY DRIBBLE of cold coffee went on her skirt. 

There was no intent to throw it at her. There was nothing in it. At the time she said nothing about it and blotted the tiny dribble with a napkin. 

She has since made a police complaint, obviously after stewing on it. I’ve been charged with domestic violence assault. DV because she is related to me. She claims to have had half a cup of coffee thrown at her. I’ve been questioned by police and formally charged. I’ve faced court once and need to go back in a couple of months. It’s cost us 6k so far in lawyers. 

I absolutely understand the need to deal with domestic violence, but this issue is trivial and she is simply exploiting the situation to maximise pain for her brother and I. It mocks the very real incidents faced by sadly too many people and wastes the time of the police and court. 

I’ve taken advice from a lawyer who has plain and simply said I should plead guilty as the incident does constitute assault under the law. The lawyer gave examples of other events that constitute assault. If you drop your bag on the bus and it lands on a passengers foot - that’s assault. If someone throws popcorn in a movie and hits a person - that’s assault. If you throw a ball in a park and it hits someone - that’s assault. There doesn’t have to be any degree of intent. 

Has anyone ever faced a trivial charge like this?

1kc647g,https://www.reddit.com/r/glucoserevolutionbook/comments/1kc647g/glucose_goddess/,Glucose Goddess,"hey guys! i’m going to be documenting my attempt at implementing the tips to reduce blood sugar spikes from the ‘glucose revolution’ book. These will include the eating order (fibre/veggies, protein, fats, carbs), ACV before sweets, savoury breakfasts and exercise after meals. I’ll try it for 30 days, starting April 30. 

For context, around August-October of last yr, I attempted to cut out processed sugar. I felt like nothing was sweet enough and it was an issue!! I also started going to the gym. I felt great!! But developed a bit of a fear around sugar and started obsessing over it, eventually falling off. As a 20 yr old uni student, a lot of my social life involves food and sweet treats, and I felt that even just 1 night out ruined my gut microbiome or something. I hope this will promote balance, but I am starting to eat lots of sugar again, so I’ll try to cut it out but using the ACV method this time.

I’ll still be exercising (gym 4x/wk, walking 7k steps daily, run 2x/wk)

I’ll document my daily progress here.

Day 1: I was so uncomfortable with fullness and bloating today, im not sure what it was from. Was gonna skip breakfast but ended up getting peanut butter on sourdough as I had a big morning ahead, skipped the coffee (if milk may cause a spike, does anyone know this??) Tried eating fibre first for lunch and dinner. After dinner and before the gym I was rly craving peanut butter so I ate some (ok a lot) with white crackers (not the best), but I wasn’t craving anything after, like I usually am. No sugar.

Day 2: this is going to be harder than I thought. When im really hungry, it’s such an effort to just eat the veggies first, I’ve ended up just eating like 3 bites of veggies before going to the carbs. Still did tho for all meals and ate what I craved. No sugar. ",1,1746097929.0,glucoserevolutionbook,0,1.0,False

1kc61ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kc61ih/does_the_ktgee_t08_wireless_earbuds_deliver_the/,Does the KTGEE T08 wireless earbuds deliver the ultimate sound experience? Review here!,"The **KTGEE T08 Wireless Earbuds** caught my attention when searching for a pair of reliable, lightweight earbuds that wouldn’t make my wallet cry. They’re packed with features like Bluetooth 5.3, 40 hours of playback, an IPX7 waterproof rating, and a sleek charging case—all of which sound downright impressive on paper. After testing them for several weeks in a diverse range of situations—gym sessions, work video calls, Netflix marathons, and even while walking in light rain—I’ve got a pretty solid idea of where these earbuds excel and where they slightly miss the mark. Below, I'll share my experience with them based on daily use.

**Design and Comfort**  
The minimalist design of the T08 earbuds is a definite winner. They’re crafted to be ultra-light, weighing just 3.9 grams per earbud, which means you barely notice them once in your ears. I’ve worn them for hours without discomfort, thanks to the U-shaped arc design. This innovative structure offers a semi-in-ear fit that comfortably molds into your ears without causing that dreaded plugged-up sensation. TPU materials also help ventilate the fit, reducing any “clammy” feeling during extended use. Their look is pretty sleek, with white as the only color offered, making them versatile for any occasion. While some may pine for color options, these still have a modern and clean aesthetic that feels premium enough for the price.  

If you’re intrigued, **[Check KTGEE T08 Wireless Earbuds price on Amazon](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0d5hg7tc3/).**

**Sound Quality**  
Audio performance is where the T08 truly shines. The 13.2mm dynamic drivers deliver a rich and fulfilling sound experience. Whether you’re plugged into a podcast or vibing to your favorite tunes, the balance of bass, mids, and treble feels just right. Though not quite audiophile-level, the thumping bass and clear treble made pop and EDM tracks much more immersive. What really caught me by surprise was how detailed the acoustic tuning felt while streaming indie-folk—the vocals came through crisp and beautifully textured. However, there’s some room for nitpicking: the sound isolation could be slightly better. Sitting in a noisy coffee shop, I found that loud conversations occasionally trickled through.

**Pairing and Latency**  
Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, the T08 earbuds perform admirably in connectivity. Pairing was essentially foolproof, taking about two seconds to sync with my phone or laptop once I popped them out of their case. The inclusion of flash pairing technology helped, making them particularly appealing when switching between devices. Latency, especially during video playbacks, was nearly non-existent. Testing them with an intense gaming session, I noticed only a microscopic lag between in-game actions and audio effects—definitely good enough for casual players. However, competitive gamers aiming for ultra-low latency might want to look elsewhere.

**Battery Life**  
Battery life often makes or breaks a pair of wireless earbuds, and I admit I’m impressed here. Each earbud offers up to 8 hours on a single charge, which stretches to an enormous 40 hours with the LED display charging case. That means less time worrying about charging and more time enjoying uninterrupted jams. Even better, a quick 15-minute charge provides about 90 minutes of music, which saved me when I forgot to charge before leaving for a long train ride.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek, lightweight design ensures a relaxed wear.  
- Low latency and stable connectivity enhance performance.  
- Extended battery life reduces frequency of recharges.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Sound isolation could be improved for noisy settings.  
- Lack of additional color options might deter style-conscious buyers.  

**Other Options**  
While the T08 earbuds are great, the market has quite a few alternatives, making the comparison inevitable. For instance, Apple’s AirPods Pro tout active noise cancellation and even richer sound quality but come at more than twice the price. Similarly, the Anker Soundcore Liberty Neo offers solid performance with a tighter focus on bass, but you’ll miss out on features like LED battery indicators and the faster pairing speeds delivered by the T08. Frankly, the T08 sits in a sweet spot that balances cost with performance, making it a smart choice for budget-conscious users who still want premium-like features.

**Price Performance**  
Balancing affordability and functionality, these earbuds deserve a nod for their bang-for-buck value. They provide solid sound quality, a sturdy build, and reliable tech at a cost that feels justified. Some products in the same range get by with average reviews and compromised features, but the T08 feels well-rounded. Sure, they don’t punch above their weight class like premium wireless earbuds, yet their everyday reliability makes them stand out for the price.

On the August night in 1933 when General Gerardo
Machado, then president of Cuba, flew out of Havana
into exile, he took with him five revolvers, seven
bags of gold, and five friends, still in their pajamas.
Gerardo Machado is buried now in a marble crypt
at Woodlawn Park Cemetery in Miami, Section Fourteen,
the mausoleum. On the March night in 1952
when Carlos Prio Socarras, who had helped depose
Gerardo Machado in 1933 and had fifteen years later
become president himself, flew out of Havana into exile,
he took with him his foreign minister, his minister
of the interior, his wife and his two small daughters.
A photograph of the occasion shows Senora de Prio,
quite beautiful, boarding the plane in what appears to
be a raw silk suit, and a hat with black fishnet veiling.
She wears gloves, and earrings. Her makeup is fresh.
The husband and father, recently the president, wears
dark glasses, and carries the younger child, Maria
Elena, in his arms.

Carlos Prio is now buried himself at Woodlawn
Park Cemetery in Miami, Section Three, not far from
Gerardo Machado, in a grave marked by a six-foot
marble stone on which the flag of Cuba waves in red, white and blue ceramic tile, carlos prio socarras
1903-1977, the stone reads, and directly below that,
as if Carlos Prio Socarras's main hedge against oblivion
had been that period at the University of Havana
when he was running actions against Gerardo Machado:
miembro del directorio estudiantil universitario
1930. Only then does the legend presidente
de la republica de cuba 1948-1952 appear, an anticlimax.
Presidencies are short and the glamours of
action long, there among the fallen frangipani and
crepe myrtle blossoms at Woodlawn Park Cemetery
in Miami. ""They say that I was a terrible president of
Cuba,"" Carlos Prio once said to Arthur M. Schlesinger,
Jr., during a visit to the Kennedy White House some
ten years into the quarter-century Miami epilogue to
his four-year Havana presidency. ""That may be true.
But I was the best president Cuba ever had.""

Many Havana epilogues have been played in Florida,
and some prologues. Florida is that part of the
Cuban stage where declamatory exits are made, and
side deals. Florida is where the chorus waits to comment
on the action, and sometimes to join it. The exiled
Jose Marti raised money among the Cuban tobacco
workers in Key West and Tampa, and in 1 894
attempted to mount an invasionary expedition from
north of Jacksonville. The exiled Fidel Castro Ruz
came to Miami in 1955 for money to take the 26 Julio
into the Sierra Maestra, and got it, from Carlos Prio.
Fulgencio Batista had himself come back from Florida
to take Havana away from Carlos Prio in 1952, but by 1958 Fidel Castro, with Carlos Prio's money,
was taking it away from Fulgencio Batista, at which
turn Carlos Prio's former prime minister tried to
land a third force in Camaguey Province, the idea being
to seize the moment from Fidel Castro, a notably
failed undertaking encouraged by the Central Intelligence
Agency and financed by Carlos Prio, at home
in Miami Beach.

This is all instructive. In the continuing opera still
called, even by Cubans who have now lived the largest
part of their lives in this country, *el exilio*, the exile,
meetings at private houses in Miami Beach are seen to
have consequences. The actions of individuals are seen
to affect events directly. Revolutions and counterrevolutions
are framed in the private sector, and the
state security apparatus exists exclusively to be enlisted
by one or another private player. That this particular
political style, indigenous to the Caribbean and
to Central America, has now been naturalized in the
United States is one reason why, on the flat coastal
swamps of South Florida, where the palmettos once
blew over the detritus of a dozen failed booms and
the hotels were boarded up six months a year, there
has evolved since the early New Year's morning in
1959 when Fulgencio Batista flew for the last time out
of Havana (for this flight, to the Dominican Republic
on an Aerovias Q DC-4, the women still wore the
evening dresses in which they had gone to dinner) a
settlement of considerable interest, not exactly an
American city as American cities have until recently
been understood but a tropical capital: long on rumor, short on memory, overbuilt on the chimera of
runaway money and referring not to New York or
Boston or Los Angeles or Atlanta but to Caracas and
Mexico, to Havana and to Bogota and to Paris and
Madrid. Of American cities Miami has since 1959
connected only to Washington, which is the peculiarity
of both places, and increasingly the warp.

In the passion of *el exilio* there are certain stations
at which the converged, or colliding, fantasies of Miami
and Washington appear in fixed relief. Resentments
are recited, rosaries of broken promises. Occasions
of error are recounted, imperfect understandings, instances
in which the superimposition of Washington
abstractions on Miami possibilities may or may not
have been, in a word Washington came to prefer
during the 1980s, flawed. On April 17, 1985, the
twenty-fourth anniversary of the aborted invasion referred
to by most Americans and even some Cubans
as the Bay of Pigs, what seems in retrospect a particularly
poignant progression of events was held in Miami
to commemorate those losses suffered in 1961 at
Playa Giron, on the southern coast of Matanzas Province,
by the 2506 Brigade, the exile invasion force
trained and supported—up to a point, the famous
point, the midnight hour when John F. Kennedy sent
down the decision to preserve deniability by withholding
air cover—by the United States government.
The actual events of this 1985 anniversary were
ritual, and as such differed only marginally from those
of other years, say 1986, when Jeane Kirkpatrick would be present, to wave small souvenir flags, American
and Cuban, and to speak of ""how different the
world would have been"" had the brigade prevailed.
By one minute past midnight on the morning of the
1985 anniversary, as in years before and after, some
thirty members of the 2506, most of them men in their
forties and fifties wearing camouflage fatigues and
carrying AR-15 rifles, veterans of the invasion plus
a few later recruits, had assembled at the Martyrs of
Giron monument on Southwest Eighth Street in Miami
and posted a color guard, to stand watch through
the soft Florida night. A tape recording of ""The Star
Spangled Banner"" had been played, and one of ""La
Bayamesa,"" the Cuban national anthem. *No temáis
una muerte gloriosa*, the lyric of ""La Bayamesa"" runs,
striking the exact note of transcendent nationalism on
which the occasion turned. *Do not fear a glorious
death: To die for patria is to live.*

By late morning the police had cordoned off the
weathered bungalow on Southwest Ninth Street which
was meant to be the Casa, Museo y Biblioteca de la
Brigada 2506 del Exilio Cubano, the projected repository
for such splinters of the true cross as the 2506
flag presented to John F. Kennedy at the Orange
Bowl, twenty months after the Bay of Pigs, when he
promised to return the flag to the brigade ""in a free
Havana"" and took it back to Washington, later expanding
its symbolic content geometrically by consigning
it to storage in what explicators of this parable
usually refer to as a dusty basement. On the morning
of the anniversary ground was being broken for the renovation of the bungalow, an occasion for Claude
Pepper, fresh from the continuing debate in the House
of Representatives over aid to the Nicaraguan contras,
to characterize the landing at Giron as ""one of the
most heroic events in the history of the world"" and
for many of those present to voice what had become
by that spring the most urgent concern of the exile
community, the very concern which now lends the
occasion its retrospective charge, that ""the freedom
fighters of the eighties"" not be treated by the Reagan
administration as the men of the 2506 had been treated,
or believed that they had been treated, by the Kennedy
administration.

Sometimes the word used to describe that treatment
was ""abandonment,"" and sometimes the word
was ""betrayal,"" but the meaning was the same, and
the ardor behind the words cut across all class lines,
not only that morning at the bungalow but later at
the roll call at the monument and still later, at the
Mass said that evening for the 2506 at the chapel on
Biscayne Bay which is so situated as to face Cuba.
There were men that morning in combat fatigues, but
there were also men in navy-blue blazers, with the
bright patch of the 2506 pinned discreetly to the
pocket. There were National Rifle Association windbreakers
and there were T-shirts featuring the American
flag and the legend these colors don't run and
there were crucifixes on bare skin and there were
knife sheaths on belts slung so low that Jockey shorts
showed, but there were also Brooks Brothers shirts, and rep ties, and briefcases of supple leather. There
were men who would go later that day to offices in
the new glass towers along Brickell Avenue, offices
with Barcelona chairs and floor-to-ceiling views of
the bay and the harbor and Miami Beach and Key
Biscayne, and there were men whose only offices
were the gun stores and the shooting ranges and the
flying clubs out off Krome Avenue, where the West
Dade subdivisions give way to the Everglades and
only the sudden glitter of water reveals its encroaching
presence and drugs get dropped and bodies dumped.

They have been construed since as political flotsam,
these men of the 2506, uniformly hard cases, drifters
among the more doubtful venues serviced by Southern
Air Transport, but this is misleading. Some members
of the 2506 had lived in Miami since before Fidel Castro
entered Havana and some had arrived as recently
as 1980, the year of the Mariel exodus. Some were
American citizens and some never would be, but they
were all Cuban first, and they proceeded equally
from a kind of collective spell, an occult enchantment,
from that febrile complex of resentments and revenges
and idealizations and taboos which renders exile so
potent an organizing principle. They shared not just
Cuba as a birthplace but Cuba as a construct, the idea
of birthright lost. They shared a definition of patria
as indivisible from personal honor, and therefore of
personal honor as that which had been betrayed and
must be revenged. They shared, not only with one
another but with virtually every other Cuban in Miami. a political matrix in which the very shape of history,
its dialectic, its tendency, had traditionally presented
itself as *la lucha*, the struggle.

For most of them as children there had of course
been the formative story of *la lucha* against Spain, the
central scenario of nineteenth-century Cuba. For some
of their fathers there had been *la lucha* against Gerardo
Machado and for some of them there had been
*la lucha* against Fulgencio Batista and for all of them—
for those who had fought originallv with the 26 Julio
and for those who had fought against it, for *barbudos*
and *Batistianos* alike—there was now *la lucha* on the
grand canvas of a quarter century, *la lucha* purified,
*la lucha* in a preservative vacuum, *la lucha* not only
against Fidel Castro but against his allies, and his
agents, and all those who could conceivably be believed
to have aided or encouraged him.

What constituted such aid or encouragement remained
the great Jesuitical subject of *el exilio*, defined
and redefined, distilled finally to that point at which a
notably different angle obtained on certain events in
the recent American past. The 1972 burglary at the
Watergate headquarters of the Democratic National
Committee, say, appeared from this angle as a patriotic
mission, and the Cubans who were jailed for it
as *mártires de la lucha*. Mariel appeared as a betrayal
on the part of yet another administration, a deal with
Fidel Castro, a decision by the Carter people to preserve
the status quo in Cuba by siphoning off the momentum
of what could have been, in the dreamtime of
*el exilio*, where the betrayal which began with the Kennedy administration continued to the day at hand,
a popular uprising. Down with the kennedy-khrushchev
pact was the legend, in Spanish, on one of
the placards bobbing for attention in front of the
minicams that day. Enough treasons. On the back
of another placard there was lettered a chant: Con-
TADORA / TRAIDORA / VENDA / PATRIA. That traitor who
would back a political settlement in Central America,
in other words, sold out his country, and so his honor.

In many ways the Bay of Pigs continued to offer
Maimi an ideal narrative, one in which the men of
the 2506 were forever the valiant and betrayed and
the United States was forever the seducer and betrayer
and the blood of los mártires remained forever
fresh. When the names of the 114 brigade members
who died in Cuba were read off that day at the Playa
Giron monument, the survivors had called out the
responses in unison, the rhythm building, clenched
fists thrust toward the sky: *Presente*, 114 times. The
women, in silk dresses and high-heeled sandals, dabbed
at their eyes behind dark glasses. ""*Es triste*"" one
woman murmured, again and again, to no one in particular.

*La tristeza de Miami*. ""We must attempt to
strengthen the non-Batista democratic anti-Castro
forces in exile,"" a Kennedy campaign statement had
declared in 1960, and Miami had for a time believed
John F. Kennedy a communicant in its faith. ""We
cannot have the United States walk away from one of
the greatest moral challenges in postwar history,""
Ronald Reagan had declared two nights before this 1985 anniversary of the Bay of Pigs, at a Nicaraguan
Refugee Fund benefit dinner in Washington, and
Miami once again believed an American president a
communicant in its faith. Even the paper thimbles of
sweet Cuban coffee distributed after the 2506 Mass
that April evening in Miami, on the steps of the chapel
which faces Cuba and has over its altar a sequined
Virgin, a Virgin dressed for her *quince*, had the aspect
of a secular communion, the body and blood of *patria,
machismo, la lucha*, sentimental trinity. That *la lucha*
had become, during the years since the Bay of Pigs, a
matter of assassinations and bombings on the streets of
American cities, of plots and counterplots and covert
dealings involving American citizens and American
institutions, of attitudes and actions which had shadowed
the abrupt termination of two American presidencies
and would eventually shadow the immobilization
of a third, was a peculiarity left, that one evening,
officially unexplored.",1,1746097471.0,RSbookclub,0,1.0,False

It's not what I expected at all,"Golden Week was the best week for my work schedule to go this spring, otherwise I would have had to wait until the fall. Reading online about Golden Week, between Reddit and any other website, it is described as if the city is packed shoulder to shoulder like sardines, and one of the worst times to visit Japan. It's impossible to get dinner unless you queue for at least 45 minutes if you want to go anywhere decent. Reading on Reddit, it sounds like Kyoto is that crowded all the time.

Well, this was giving me so much anxiety leading up to our trip. I was experiencing so much stress before getting here (this is our second stop). You probably see where I'm getting with this. The way the city is described is so far from the truth, it's laughable. 

Yes, there are crowds in certain places. The main drag going from Yasaka Shrine to Kiyomizu is crowded, but so are so many other places I've been to that are crowded like Paris, Rome, even Vienna, which caught me by surprise. I will actually say Vienna is even is worse since there are 45 minute queues just to go to coffee houses. 
Kyoto is not special when it comes to crowds. It is actually incredibly uncrowded aside from the top tourist spots. 

Despite the crowd at Kiyomizu, we still got great pictures, and there was no queue at all getting into Kiyomizu at noon today with our tour guide, probably a peak travel time. There was plenty of room in the main hall. I did also go to Kiyomizu on my own at 6 am, and it is more peaceful without the crowds but no more beautiful. This is embarrassing, but I was stressed about my Kiyomizu tour being at noon from what I read online about the crowds, that I actually woke up at 3:30 am and couldn't fall back asleep, which is why I went at Kiyomizu when it opened, in case my noon tour was going to be a disaster (it was not). If you want to see crowds, go to the Vatican, even first thing in the morning. And you cannot get in right away, even the same day, because it is sold out. There is no queue option.

We went to Arashiyama Bamboo Grove again at a peak travel time, 2 pm. Crowded but not shoulder to shoulder or anything, plenty of room to walk, and again, actually better than a lot of other places I've been to. It is less crowded than Nice's old town, and even smaller towns in the French Riviera I visited when I went there, and you never read about crazy crowds in small French Riviera towns (at least I haven't). The bamboo grove walk actually is pretty sprawling, and isn't crowded after a couple minutes of first entering. We went to Ōkōchi Sansō - beautiful, not crowded at all and a top tourist stop in Arashiyama.  

On top of this, most places we have gone to in Kyoto are not crowded AT ALL. It's like visiting Paris (outside of Eiffel Tower, Champs Élysées) when I went in August when every Parisian is on vacation somewhere else and it is dead.  

The city is beautiful and walking these peaceful quiet streets has been so enjoyable. Don't believe everything you read on this sub. Maybe it's a good thing I came in with low expectations because I have just been blown away by this city. But being a naturally anxious person, I wish I didn't have to experience the stress that I did, so I hope this is helpful for others who can make it to Japan at no other time than Golden Week.",70,1746097092.0,JapanTravelTips,40,0.91,False

I kept putting ointment on it and then on a sunday i suddenly got red painfull spots that looked kinda like acne cysts. I could not even pee normally without pain 😨

I always did sex with condom, take good care my my private parta and overall hygiene and did regular stds testing. I always tested for the 5 main soa's hell did i know i should also test for herpes. They really should include herpes in those test!
I never get a cold sore and never got the herpes spots at my private parts.
 
I only had 3 relationships in my life and 1 fwb ( always used condoms) 

I went to the doctor and she took a swab and i was shocked by the result and i feel my life is over. Even the doctor did not thought it was herpes type 2.  I did alot of crying and feeling very depressed i am even considering trying anti depressants.  I am going to see a psycologist soon. I live i the NL and my doctor said only when i have more then 6 outbreaks a year she wants to give me the anti viral medicatiom for a longer time. ☹️ im like i want to prevent that from happening.  I have no idea when of from ho or how i got this. With sex and foreplay i am always mindfull and carefull.

It feels the universe is against me.
I also got a stomach surgeryin 2019 i lost about 53 kilo in a year. So having loose skin makes me ugly and insecure but i dont have money now for surgeries to get it removed.

I did alot of research and i am doing the following things:

1. I told my fwb about it because its the right thing to do even tho i started crying again because i now feel like a freak and who ever wants to date me again or get into a relationship.

( i also recently found out at the doctor i have other woman womb and cervix issues  (i got ectropion, hpv positive, and my vaginal cells are lighty abnormal 😥). I took me a while to mentally recover from that and now i got again something horrible.☹️

2. I am taking daily l-lysine 2400 mg per day.

3. I take 1.000 vit Cto hopefully help my imum system.

4. I have to take my daily multivitamin and 2x calcium because of my gastric bypass.

5. I dont smoke, rarely drink alcohol, dont do drugs since my whole life.

6. I try to eat more lysine rich foods and less argine.

7. I take 5.000 uid vit D with K2 every day.

8. I want to try meditation to reduce my stress because i dont handle stress good.

9. My sleep i have to work on.
My period i cannot control i do have a koperspiral because my body does not like hormones and the koperspiral was the only option becasuse normal birth control my body does not obsorb.

10. I am stopping drinking my daily espresso or strong coffee. I love strong coffee 😥 so i am switching to decaf and tea.

11. I finally after begging got the anti viral medicine called: Valaciclovir 500 mg for a daily maintance for max 6 months. Does anyone have side effects from it.? I got constant headaches.

12. I am back to eating meats. I am trying to eat healthy and low sugar. I am eating more like a medditarian diet. 

13. I used to get a brazilian wax done with sugar wax every 4 weeks.  I think i will still do that only get the hairs from my bikin line, bottom removed.  I heard waxing might trigger a outbreak. 
Does having pubic hairs but trimmed so its not too long hopefully help to make transmission rates smaller from woman to men?

14. What are the transmission rates now that i am on the medicine, and using condom and not having sex using while having shedding and outbreak from F to M?

15. How do i recognize shedding symtomps?  
Am i contagious for someone else during my shedding, outbreak and afterwards period?

If i touch my private part and acciddentally touch someone mouth does that person get then type 1 herpes?  Or if i accidently touch their private are do they get then also herpes type 2? Is the skin on skin contact contagious with the fluid inside the sores?  
Or also my muscus membrames liquids  from my private area if i for example get aroused?

And what are the transmission rate if i dont take the anti viral medicine but of course use condom and having sex while having no shedding and no outbreak? 

I read online some numbers but why is it higher from F to M then from M to F?

I Feel alone and dont know how to deal with this.

Yes, i understand  the living room is the family room, but my husband and i recently moved and decorated the living room with a lot of glass and expensive furniture + items. so i don’t allow my younger ones 3 & 5 in the living room. only my oldest (8) to watch TV. however i don’t allow feet on my coffee table and no food and drinks only water. is this too much? 

2. No food in bedrooms only at the table.

3. Change as soon as you get home 
Germs and bacteria get all over them after i come home from work and also when they come back from school and daycare. so i make everyone shower and wash up before going into their rooms or doing anything in the house. 

UPDATE ‼️ my kids rooms are fully equipped with toys eg: kitchen set, barbie dream house, dolls and busy books and a small tv mounted on the wall for their entertainment. after work i usually make dinner and as im waiting i go into their room and just hang out with my children. after we eat we do homework on the kitchen table and we go back into their room and play or head to the park. i dont stay in the living room as its for my aesthetic and what i want in a home ",0,1746096845.0,Parenting,45,0.29,False

It’s not a caffeine crash, and I wasn’t tired beforehand. It’s like I’m too sleepy to drive or think clearly, but at the same time too jittery to sit still. Even trying to nap in that state makes me feel more tired afterward. The only thing that really helps is playing video games: something that keeps my brain lightly engaged without being too intense.

For starters let me mention that I’ve not saved up enough for a grinder yet. I have my eyes on either the Varia grinder or a manual 1Zpresso J-Ultra. For now, I go to a local roaster and purchase a half pound of their house espresso roast and have them grind it for me there. I understand this is less than ideal, and with each passing day the coffee becomes more and more stale even in its sealed bag. I’ve noticed that my first shot always runs super fast. Like 45-50 grams of coffee out within 15 seconds. I’ve been putting it to the side to make an iced coffee drink as to not waste it, but honestly it’s not that great to drink and I might just start dumping it. What confuses me is that my process is the same both times.

>To brew 700ml of water, you can use a coffee-to-water ratio of 1 to 1, which is a common range for a balanced flavor. Using a 1 ratio, you would need approximately 44 grams of coffee grounds (since 700ml divided by 16 is about 43.75 grams). For a slightly stronger brew, you could use a 1 ratio, which would require about 47 grams of coffee grounds.

I don't understand where the dividing 700ml (of liquid) by 16 comes from.

If I use 44g of coffee ground, doesn't a 1-1 ratio imply I'll need also need the same amount by weight of liquid?  700ml of water definitely does not equal to 44grams.

I kept putting ointment on it and then on a sunday i suddenly got red painfull spots that looked kinda like acne cysts. I could not even pee normally without pain 😨

I always did sex with condom, take good care my my private parta and overall hygiene and did regular stds testing. I always tested for the 5 main soa's hell did i know i should also test for herpes. They really should include herpes in those test!
I never get a cold sore and never got the herpes spots at my private parts.
 
I only had 3 relationships in my life and 1 fwb ( always used condoms) 

I went to the doctor and she took a swab and i was shocked by the result and i feel my life is over. Even the doctor did not thought it was herpes type 2.  I did alot of crying and feeling very depressed i am even considering trying anti depressants.  I am going to see a psycologist soon. I live i the NL and my doctor said only when i have more then 6 outbreaks a year she wants to give me the anti viral medicatiom for a longer time. ☹️ im like i want to prevent that from happening.  I have no idea when of from ho or how i got this. With sex and foreplay i am always mindfull and carefull.

It feels the universe is against me.
I also got a stomach surgeryin 2019 i lost about 53 kilo in a year. So having loose skin makes me ugly and insecure but i dont have money now for surgeries to get it removed.

I did alot of research and i am doing the following things:

1. I told my fwb about it because its the right thing to do even tho i started crying again because i now feel like a freak and who ever wants to date me again or get into a relationship.

( i also recently found out at the doctor i have other woman womb and cervix issues  (i got ectropion, hpv positive, and my vaginal cells are lighty abnormal 😥). I took me a while to mentally recover from that and now i got again something horrible.☹️

2. I am taking daily l-lysine 2400 mg per day.

3. I take 1.000 vit Cto hopefully help my imum system.

4. I have to take my daily multivitamin and 2x calcium because of my gastric bypass.

5. I dont smoke, rarely drink alcohol, dont do drugs since my whole life.

6. I try to eat more lysine rich foods and less argine.

7. I take 5.000 uid vit D with K2 every day.

8. I want to try meditation to reduce my stress because i dont handle stress good.

9. My sleep i have to work on.
My period i cannot control i do have a koperspiral because my body does not like hormones and the koperspiral was the only option becasuse normal birth control my body does not obsorb.

10. I am stopping drinking my daily espresso or strong coffee. I love strong coffee 😥 so i am switching to decaf and tea.

11. I finally after begging got the anti viral medicine called: Valaciclovir 500 mg for a daily maintance for max 6 months. Does anyone have side effects from it.? I got constant headaches.

12. I am back to eating meats. I am trying to eat healthy and low sugar. I am eating more like a medditarian diet. 

13. I used to get a brazilian wax done with sugar wax every 4 weeks.  I think i will still do that only get the hairs from my bikin line, bottom removed.  I heard waxing might trigger a outbreak. 
Does having pubic hairs but trimmed so its not too long hopefully help to make transmission rates smaller from woman to men?

14. What are the transmission rates now that i am on the medicine, and using condom and not having sex using while having shedding and outbreak from F to M?

15. How do i recognize shedding symtomps?  
Am i contagious for someone else during my shedding, outbreak and afterwards period?

If i touch my private part and acciddentally touch someone mouth does that person get then type 1 herpes?  Or if i accidently touch their private are do they get then also herpes type 2? Is the skin on skin contact contagious with the fluid inside the sores?  
Or also my muscus membrames liquids  from my private area if i for example get aroused?

And what are the transmission rate if i dont take the anti viral medicine but of course use condom and having sex while having no shedding and no outbreak? 

I read online some numbers but why is it higher from F to M then from M to F?

I Feel alone and dont know how to deal with this.

## Key Features Analysis

The models analyzed offer diverse functionality and design catering to a breadth of customer needs.

**Height adjustability**

Height adjustability stands as a crucial factor in projector stand selection. Projector stands in this year's guide boast a wide range of height adjustments. Entry-level options offer a limited range, usually spanning from 20 to 40 inches, while higher-end models frequently enough provide a telescopic range from 30 to 60 inches or more. This extended adjustability allows for compatibility across diverse environments, from low coffee tables to high presentation stages. Precision height locking mechanisms are also worth investigating to ensure stability at the selected height.

**Tilt and Swivel Functionality**

beyond height, the ability to tilt and swivel the projector is critical for achieving perfect image alignment.Many of the featured stands incorporate a multi-axis adjustment system that allows for tilting forward and backward (typically +/- 15 degrees) and swiveling horizontally (often a full 360 degrees). This versatility ensures the projector can be precisely positioned to compensate for uneven surfaces or off-center projection requirements. Check for stands with smooth, dampened movements to avoid abrupt adjustments that could disrupt the image.

**Weight Capacity**

weight capacity cannot be overlooked. Projector stands must be robust enough to support the weight of the projector without wobbling or collapsing. Entry-level stands frequently enough are rated for weights around 10 to 15 pounds, while more rugged models can handle projectors weighing up to 25 or even 30 pounds. Always cross-reference the projector’s weight with the stand's specified capacity, and it's advisable to select a stand with a slightly higher capacity than needed for added safety and stability. Overloading a stand can lead to damaged equipment and a compromised viewing experience.**Material and Build Quality**

The materials used in a projector stand's construction directly impact its durability and stability.steel and aluminum are standard choices, with steel offering greater strength and aluminum providing a lighter weight. High-quality stands will feature powder-coated finishes to resist scratches and corrosion. Sturdy welds and robust locking mechanisms contribute to the stand’s overall stability.Consider stands with non-slip rubber feet to prevent movement on smooth floors.

**Portability and Storage**

For users who need to transport their projector stand frequently, portability and storage are essential features. Look for stands that can be easily folded or disassembled into a compact form. Lightweight materials are also an advantage for transport. Some stands come with carrying cases that simplify transport and protect the stand from damage during travel.Consider the weight and size of the folded stand when making a purchase decision if portability is a primary concern.

**Cable Management**

Effective cable management helps maintain a clean and organized setup. Integrated cable channels or clips are common features that allow users to neatly route power cables, HDMI cables, and othre cords, preventing them from becoming tangled or obstructing the viewing experience. Some premium stands offer hidden cable routing within the stand's structure,providing an even cleaner aesthetic. Poor cable management can not only be unsightly but also pose a safety hazard.

## FAQs Section

**Are these projector stands compatible with all projector brands?**

They typically feature a standard mounting platform with adjustable screws and attachments to accommodate various projector sizes and mounting configurations.Always double-check the stand's specifications to ensure the projector's mounting points align with it.

**How do I determine the right height for my projector stand?**
To determine the right height, consider the height of the screen or projection surface and the desired image placement. Ideally, the projector lens should be aligned with the center of the screen. Measure the distance from the floor to the center of the screen, and choose a stand that allows the projector to be positioned at that height. Adjustable stands offer flexibility to fine-tune the image alignment.

**What type of maintenance is required for these projector stands?**
Projector stands require minimal maintenance. Regularly wipe down the stand with a damp cloth to remove dust and dirt.Periodically check the screws and bolts to ensure they are tightened to prevent wobbling.

**Can I use these projector stands outdoors?**
Several of these projector stands are suitable for outdoor use, especially models constructed from corrosion-resistant materials like aluminum or stainless steel.Though, it is indeed essential to protect the projector and stand from rain and extreme weather conditions.

1kc5hlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1kc5hlp/going_to_management_about_a_coworker/,Going to management about a coworker,"I have a coworker who has made me really uncomfortable several times because she’s very hard to work with. I go by a different name than my legal one and for awhile she wouldn’t call me the name I introduce myself with, the name that is printed on my name tag. This coworker, I’m gonna call her A, she also supposedly made a manager cry and quit because she wasn’t listening to the instructions from the manager, who she according to what I heard continued to yell at her and insult her for 15+ minutes and other management didn’t try to stop her. I have noticed this with A and I know it has been a problem where she will walk away from her work station and do something else. Management seems to let her get away with whatever. She does whatever she wants. 

For context we work in a coffee shop. Yesterday a supervisor, let’s call her B, put me on hot/iced drinks and A on espresso. I’ve been struggling to understand the management style where I work. One of my other managers has been working up there during a rush and is asking me to train him. I couldn’t believe it, and that happened twice with two different higher ups. I am also used to management delegating tasks but B was trying to get me to do it for the second time. I was getting a bit fed up truthfully because I hate getting expected to do management stuff when that isn’t my job, and I’ve been setting boundaries with them because I refuse to do more work for the same pay. If they want me training and delegating tasks that’s a supervisor role and they need to pay me more. 

Anyway, I handled only the hot/iced drinks per B’s instruction and once I was done with those, I took the time to clean, restock, and organize. A wasn’t keeping her space clean at all. It was a mess. She left the ice scoop in the big thing of ice we have. One time I worked at another company and that happened. Maybe it was overkill but it was considered cross contamination so we had to toss the entire thing. I don’t see cleaning/servsafe policies getting used when they’re supposed to. Other baristas often don’t wear gloves. 

I did hear A talking to herself as she was making the drinks. I was focusing on restocking and didn’t hear the content of what she was saying. Then eventually A walked off to do whatever she wanted. After that, B told me A was complaining and annoyed that I wasn’t helping her. First of all I was helping her by organizing/restocking. But I suppose she wanted help on the espresso machine and she never mentioned it to me. I told B that we’re adults and if she needs help she needs to communicate that to me. I can’t help her if she never says a single thing to me. I’m getting frustrated because we are supposed to work as a team. Then B said that I shouldn’t help A regardless because A will get annoyed at that too. She kinda takes over the workspace and I don’t know if she expects everything to go her way or what. I don’t really understand how to interact with management at this job. That wasn’t constructive from B at all. If it isn’t constructive, why am I even being told any of this? 

I feel uncomfortable with A. I also am really struggling with understanding the management style but I don’t think I’m going to bring that up in the meeting. I don’t know if I should. I wanna go to my manager about A. How should I approach this with him? If there are managers who have insight on this I welcome all your thoughts.

The most recent things include: how I angle my pillow on my bed, my diet doesn't suit her own lifestyle (I don't eat with them and make my own food so she thinks I'm not eating healthy) so she got me a bunch of probiotics and yesterday, she freaked out over me getting drinking water over the bathroom sink instead of filtered/boiled water from the kitchen. I live in Canada and water is potable.

I lived alone for 10 years without her nagging and was low contact, and I was living the way I had completely fine! But now that I had to move back into her house, she thinks it's license for her to bestow her anxiety on me again.

The worst part is that I actually become extremely anxious over the shit afterwards too. I ended up buying a water filter even though I KNOW I DON'T NEED IT (I boil my own water or use my coffee machine with a filter). I hate how her anxiety is affecting me AGAIN and I can't do anything about it. ",1,1746095389.0,AsianParentStories,0,1.0,False

I used both their free plan and tried their Premium plan for a month. I tested it with content I wrote myself and stuff I asked ChatGPT to write. I got some weird results.

# Features I found useful:

\* Simple interface that shows you which parts of text might be AI-generated

\* Gives you a percentage score for how likely content is AI-written

\* Works with multiple languages

\* Offers a Chrome extension for quick checks

\* Has a free tier that lets you check up to 10,000 words per month

# The good parts:

\* Easy to use with a clean design

\* The free plan works well for basic checks

\* It can catch obvious ChatGPT text sometimes

\* Provides specific highlighting of suspicious sections

\* Fast processing speed

# The problems I faced:

\* False positives are a big issue - it flagged my completely handwritten essay at 51% AI

\* When I slightly changed one sentence, it suddenly marked my whole paragraph as AI

\* It missed some content I had ChatGPT write completely

\* Not consistent - sometimes the same text gets different scores

\* Premium plan ($12.99/month) didn't seem much better than the free version

# My experience:

I first tried GPTZero because my professor mentioned they use it to check student work. I wrote an essay for my history class and decided to check it before submitting. To my shock, it said my introduction paragraph was ""likely written by AI"" even though I wrote it myself late at night with a cup of coffee!

The weird part was when I tested actual ChatGPT content - some passed as ""human written"" while my own writing got flagged. I even tried pasting in old papers I wrote years ago (before ChatGPT existed), and some sections got flagged as AI.

I looked into competitors like ZeroGPT and Winston AI. They seem to have similar issues, though ZeroGPT felt a bit more accurate in my tests.

I think these tools are still too unreliable for schools to use them for grading. My professor almost gave me a zero on an assignment because of a false positive from GPTZero. We need to be careful about trusting these tools too much.

Auren POV

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Reed.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”",1,1746095314.0,WhereToreadStories,1,1.0,False

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”",1,1746095178.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Reed.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

Hi all, Welcome to my new book. Hope you enjoy it! 

Chapter 2
Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”

Chapter 3
Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.

“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”

“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”

“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.

Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.

Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul. There were tattoos of vines and thorns on his muscular arms. His presence was magnetic yet menacing, like that of a silent, dangerous predator cloaked in charm.
