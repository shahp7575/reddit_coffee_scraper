(M19-21)","Hello, as the title states, when ever I try to start a relationship, things go great for roughly two weeks until the other person just falls off. 

I dont really know if its a me thing or the other people thing, but its really starting to take a toll on me as I always feel like someone's third choice, and that Im often just being kept around as an option to settle for, rather than a direct choice. I've been in ""two"" relationships before, both were ended by me simply because I didnt feel like we were a good match (first one he lived abt an hour and a half away and was extremely generous with money and idk just rubbed me the wrong way, second one we both mutrally agreed to end things and just remain friends as a relationship prob wouldnt work out from us).

However, Ive been using the apps like Tinder/Hinge to meet people and like, while things begin great, we talk back and forth, quick replies & actual conversation, after about two weeks it eventually just kinda dies? I dont know if its something I do to cause this, or if i keep going after unavaliable people, but its starting to kinda hit me that I havent really ever been someone's first choice when it comes to dating. 

Example One: Joe and I met on Grindr, however we both agreed we were kindve looking for something more than just a one night thing. So we add each other on snap and honestly its going really well. We keep talking & eventually decide to grab coffee together. The coffee went shockingly well, and I asked him for his number as, for me social media is where I send people to be forgotten about, I dont really use it or like it as a way to talk to others. We keep talking for a few more days, and honestly things seemed fine, we were still getting to know each other, made loose plans to meet again sometime the randomly he just stopped replying to texts and completely ghosted me. I asked a mutral and she refused to comment on the situation and honestly it has just left me confused. I sent an apology text & a I wont contact him again text and it was left there. However I was never told if it was something on my end or his, however based on the mutral's response I guess it was something I did at some point.

Example Two: Brendan and I met on Hinge. We start talking and I quickly realize that he is putting in a lot more effort than the previous people I had spoken to off of Hinge. We talk on there for a few days and things go great, so we move over to Insta to just get off Hinge & so we can send each other pics & see each other's lives a bit better. Overall its going really well. I had tickets to a concert through my work that I had forgotten about, and remembered the day before, and offered him the tickets, we went and had a great time spending almost 6h together. I also did ask for his number before we parted ways because I was really feeling him. We continue chatting and plan to meet again in a few days, which we do. We walked the mall, grabbed some fast food & painted some ceramics in a local store. Honestly the entire thing went super well in my opinion, and I was excited for the third time we can both find time to meet up again, as I was quite into him. However directly after his response times fell off, conversation fell off, and he fell off (Again around the 2 week point.) and I am just thoroughly confused as to why this keeps happening.

Ive made it clear to the people Ive met off the apps that I dont want to rush things and that Im just going with the flow at the moment, and everyone Ive spoken to has agreed with me on that front. I havent gotten down on one knee and asked these people to marry me, or even call me their partner. The farthest Ive gone is with Brendan, I asked him if he was talking to anyone else (after about two weeks) just to see where/what he felt, and he said he was kindve talking to some other people. I phrased it as I was asking nothing more than the question, as I wanted to make sure we were on similar pages of kinda how we felt about each other however after that he fell off. 

I dont necessarily see an issue with a question like that however I feel like that is part of the issue as to why people quit responding to me over time. For me, I just ask as I dont really want to ""waste time"" with someone who isnt really interested in me. I know two weeks can be kinda fast to ask a question like that, however that was the only time ive asked someome that and that was because I was seriously feeling him.

Overall I dont know, it could be that Im chasing up the wrong trees and going after the wrong kind of people, or that I am seriously fucking shit up in some way and not realizing it. I have no clue if I explained everything right, if yalls have any questions please ask below and I will try to respond, Id just like some advice on how to quit fumbling the bag every chance Im given.",1,1728929473.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I'm not sure how many specialty coffee fans are on this sub but I'm curious to know who has bought the premium coffees from Father?

I'm talking about coffees like the Letty Bermudez geisha which sells for R1400 (it's actually sold out now), the zeo geisha or even some or even some of their 'regular' other special release coffees. 

I've bought some special release before, and they are great coffees, but I don't buy them often. 

FWIW, I really dig father and what they're doing. They are my favourite South African roaster.

Edit: For those not into specialty coffee, these prices are probably eye wateringly expensive. I agree, the special release range has a big premium slapped on and it is unattainable and not relatable to a lot of people. With that said, specialty coffee is a growing industry and the premium price often (not always) filters down the supply chain to the farmers who are growing higher quality and lower yield crops. As for father coffee, the coffees they offer are on par with some of the best roastaries in the world and it's cool to see them offered in SA. ",1,1728929289.0,southafrica,1,1.0,False

Did a good amount of reading on it before going thru with it and a lot of it was very positive and the only negative thing people said about it was mostly around the taste or consistency or stickiness. 

It arrived last friday and I thought I’d give it a go with a small bit when it came in to see how the taste was which I found to actually taste great to me 😅 it tastes like espresso, but really concentrated if that makes sense. Sort of like I’m chewing on a gummy coffee bean.

Very nauseous, but I had a rather empty stomach, so I was mostly dry heaving, but definitely coming out the other end. 

I called in from work because of this, and while the vomiting has subsided, my stomach is cramping at times and I can’t explain that I’m terribly hungry, but I just can’t bring myself to eat much. 

Did I likely overload my body with too much too quick? Or does this have some sort of detoxification process?

I had a girlfriend here and there but it was always a bad relationship where I wasnt treated with much respect, but I didnt have much for myself so I figured this is just what love is.

Then after 25 years old, I gained a little self respect, I started working out, dialling in every part of my life, all that nerdiness paid off because now I make great money, my job is cool, I own my own business in addition which also makes good money, I am in great shape (I am repeatedly told about how ""manly"" I look), I have accumulated great life experiences that always translate into great conversation, and I have refined my personality and game. I am all around ""that guy"" that everyone always wants to be. My life is amazing, literally firing on all cylinders.

Now at 30, this has translated into an amount of attention that me from ages 5-25 could never have imagined, and all it has done is given me a basic hatred towards women. Women will come and try to chat when they're with their husbands, literally the other day a pregnant woman came and sat and struck up a conversation with me at a coffee shop while her husband was in line and she made some remarks about how it was his job and we joked. And her husband sat down and I tried so hard to make him the star, but she kept goddamn eye \*\*\*\* me, like he wasnt even there. This happens practically every time I go out, women will be on a date and they just dont stop peeking over, at concerts girls will try to dance around me literally slowly hovering away from their current dates. I remember once at a grocery store, a woman beside me, and I decide to strike up a conversation, I ask her for her number, and she shows me her ring, but then like grabs my arm and is like I literally would love to, I love your approach, and like she lingers there her hand on my arm, and I can  tell shes squeezing to feel my arm to feel my triceps, she literally wants me to ask for her number again despite the ring - she literally is like if I wasnt married, and just lingered there - I left the grocery store livid, I imagined my non-existent future wife doing that and I wouldn't even know. I wish I could tell that womans husband what she did, how he was basically being fooled. Last night I went to a coffee shop to enjoy live music, work, and sip some decaf for a few hours, a couple was on a date to my 1 o clock guy facing away from me, girl facing towards me, and for the next 2 hours, every few seconds, her eyes dart over, every few minutes she stares a bit longer. I don't know if her guy didn't notice, or he didn't care, or what. Then he went to the bathroom, and we locked eyes and i smile being friendly, and she blushes and looks down. Can you imagine being on a date and you go for a coffee and this happens to you? Your girl smiles and blushes for another guy? What the heck.

I can tell it makes other guys dislike me too, they already aren't happy that their partners are talking to some random guy and then they always push the conversation to ""what do you do for work"" , I drop what I'm doing, they can literally google me, and I can see it, women immediately go ""wow youre so cool"", and guys will suddenly become a little quieter. I hate it, I was that guy, I can see myself in every guy that suddenly looks a little less happy.

I know this is just the facts of life, it happens to everyone, a guy sees a girl hotter than his girlfriend he'll do a little looking over. I get it, we're just animals looking for the next best  prospect, but, I have an anger from this that I just hold on a daily basis.

All I wanted as a child was some of this type of love and attention, now that I have it, I realize there's no such thing as the kind of love, we're all just solipsistic animals looking for the next best thing. I used to believe in the movie kind of love, now I believe in a utilitarian hierarchy of  attraction.

I may be doing great, but is the girl I'm with doing the same to any guy better looking or ""higher"" on the totem pole? If my girl gets pregnant will she flirt with some guy at a coffee shop while I'm right there - what is a man to do?",1,1728929071.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

Is it normal to move that fast? Or was it the coffee date? haha! Should I have asked her out to dinner?!

- How long do you message/chat with someone before meeting up?

I need at least a week of regular communication to get a feel for someone, maybe longer. Am I an outlier? Do most people want to meet immediately?

Smoothies are thick, creamy beverages usually blended from puréed fruits, vegetables, juices, yogurt, nuts, seeds, and/or dairy or nondairy milk.

# [Click to Get The 21 Day Smoothie Diet Plan With a 10% Discount OFF](https://shorturl.at/fVqH4)

Many smoothies include frozen produce or ice cubes to give the final product the cool, icy consistency of a milkshake. However, their flavor profiles vary tremendously depending on the ingredients. Why is the Smoothie Diet so effective?

The most basic smoothie starts with two essential ingredients — a base and a liquid. From there, you can combine ingredients to your liking.

Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. This Smoothie Diet cuts out all the awful foods that are making you gain weight while boosting your metabolism, cutting your cravings, and reducing your caloric intake (without ever leaving you hungry). Plus, the Smoothie Diet is insanely convenient. Convenience is the single biggest factor that leads to diet success or failure. If something is hard, you’re unlikely to stick with it. If it’s a breeze, then why wouldn’t you follow through?

The best thing about the ***Smoothie Diet*** is that it helps you KEEP LOSING WEIGHT even after the 21 days are over. Many of Drew’s clients choose to swap out one meal per day with a smoothie for a few more weeks or months. And since it’s already a habit and you already love the smoothies, it’s easy to keep going until you hit your goal weight.

Many smoothies include frozen produce or ice cubes to give the final product the cool, icy consistency of a milkshake. However, their flavor profiles vary tremendously depending on the ingredients. Why is the Smoothie Diet so effective?

The most basic smoothie starts with two essential ingredients — a base and a liquid. From there, you can combine ingredients to your liking.

Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. This Smoothie Diet cuts out all the awful foods that are making you gain weight while boosting your metabolism, cutting your cravings, and reducing your caloric intake (without ever leaving you hungry). Plus, the Smoothie Diet is insanely convenient. Convenience is the single biggest factor that leads to diet success or failure. If something is hard, you’re unlikely to stick with it.

Another client, Dawn, lost 14 lbs in 21 days. So, while there is no specific number, you can be sure you’ll lose weight and love the process.

","# What are smoothies?

Smoothies are thick, creamy beverages usually blended from puréed fruits, vegetables, juices, yogurt, nuts, seeds, and/or dairy or nondairy milk.

# [Click to Get The 21 Day Smoothie Diet Plan With a 10% Discount OFF](https://shorturl.at/fVqH4)

Many smoothies include frozen produce or ice cubes to give the final product the cool, icy consistency of a milkshake. However, their flavor profiles vary tremendously depending on the ingredients. Why is the Smoothie Diet so effective?

The most basic smoothie starts with two essential ingredients — a base and a liquid. From there, you can combine ingredients to your liking.

Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. This Smoothie Diet cuts out all the awful foods that are making you gain weight while boosting your metabolism, cutting your cravings, and reducing your caloric intake (without ever leaving you hungry). Plus, the Smoothie Diet is insanely convenient. Convenience is the single biggest factor that leads to diet success or failure. If something is hard, you’re unlikely to stick with it. If it’s a breeze, then why wouldn’t you follow through?

The best thing about the ***Smoothie Diet*** is that it helps you KEEP LOSING WEIGHT even after the 21 days are over. Many of Drew’s clients choose to swap out one meal per day with a smoothie for a few more weeks or months. And since it’s already a habit and you already love the smoothies, it’s easy to keep going until you hit your goal weight.

# Can we Lose Weight with Smoothies Diet plans?

Smoothies are an increasingly popular wellness trend and are frequently marketed as a health food.

These versatile beverages are portable, family-friendly, and modifiable for any taste or dietary preference. ***Smoothies*** are easy to prepare yourself, but you can also purchase fresh or bottled ones from specialty cafés and most major grocery stores.

# [Click to Get The 21 Day Smoothie Diet Plan With a 10% Discount OFF](https://shorturl.at/fVqH4)

While some types are loaded with veggies and fruit, others pack sugar or other unhealthy ingredients. As such, you may wonder whether they’re a healthy choice. This article explains everything you need to know about smoothies, including their potential health benefits and downsides, whether they aid weight loss and tips for making nutritionally balanced versions at home.

# Do smoothies aid weight loss?

Smoothies are frequently marketed as a weight loss tool. Research suggests they may be effective for this purpose as long as they’re not causing you to exceed your daily calorie needs. While some people find smoothies an easy way to monitor food portions and stay on top of their  
weight loss goals, others may not feel as full when they drink their calories rather than eating them.

It was MADE for busy people.

If you’re busy, then you’re about to fall in love with a diet (yes, you read that correctly). As long as you can set aside about ***20 minutes to make the smoothies*** in the morning, you’ll have all the time you need to make this diet work for you.

# You don’t have to give up food.

This isn’t JUST a smoothie diet. You drink 2 smoothies every day, but you still eat a whole healthy meal and snacks every day (samples are provided in the Smoothie Diet guide). If you need or want a break, you can add in a flex day every week and just eat regular foods (following the included Smoothie Diet guide). This flexibility makes it easy to manage, even if your schedule is unpredictable.

# It’s easier than pie (and also kind of tastes like pie?)

All the recipes are super easy to follow and made with ingredients you can find in any grocery store. (And yes, they’re decadent and delicious!)

# And most importantly, you can lose as much weight

# as you want!

1g3m0nz,https://i.redd.it/pj2k5j2cfrud1.jpeg,I was fired today ,"I got fired

Ok so I worked a job at popular drive thru coffee shop originated in Oregon, if you know you know. I got fired today for being late yesterday morning for being an hour late to work. I know it was dumb but listen please. I am service connected and diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression along with insomnia etc. last week Monday I was in a terrible car accident and my car was totaled. I almost left the chat lol (for all the older ppl, I almost died) I was very transparent with management the whole way through. They also are aware of my disabilities (literally got in trouble prior for parking in the handicap spot when I have a handicap tag) My anxiety has been through the roof and I’ve been taking my prescribed medication as per usual. If anyone has taken cymbalta, trazadone, or hydroyxzine, you know how these meds work. Well I overslept and woke up out of my sleep panicking because I realized I was sleeping a little too good I guess. It takes me about 40 mins to get to work and I made it of course an hour late. I notified management about my tardiness right away and they’ve been made aware of how stressed and anxious I’ve been all week due to my accident. Well I got fired for being late after I worked my entire shift. Mind you they know I’m a disabled vet and everything else. I was wondering if this would be considered a ADA violation? Because I thought they can’t terminate me due to performance issues (being late) caused by my disability… or am I incorrect? Please help me. Also don’t be a a$$hat. I generally want to know if I should do something about it or just let it go.

The weird woozy, faint feeling: It happens frequently but I'll give a brief background of what it was today.. Woke up, had coffee, ate, definitely have a head cold but overall I was okay. 2 hour car ride to a Ren faire. Pretty much fine, walked a little sat down for a show, and like ten minutes in I got super woozy, how but felt like my skin was cold, thought I might pass out. Saw stars a little bit. I felt like I probably looked pale. I had a little vitamin water and just waited it out because I didn't want to cause a scene. It lasted a couple minutes. I felt off all day after that but it didn't happen that severely again. 

I'm just curious why this might happen like this. It's more often when I'm sitting than when I'm up and about which seems backwards to me but idk anything. If I missed any important details just ask and I'll answer!  TIA ",2,1728928032.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I realize it might sound trivial at first, but everyday things like coffee touch on some pretty fundamental questions. In a capitalist system, it’s straightforward—private businesses compete to provide products, and I exchange money for a cappuccino. But I’m curious how this process would work under other political systems, especially socialist or alternative models. 

Who grows the beans? Who runs the coffee shop? Would there be competition, or would things like coffee shops be collectively managed? How is the price decided, or is it provided free? And, most importantly, what would the experience feel like—would it be different from how we get coffee today?

Ive been playing like crazy the past 4 months. Yesterday morning i was playing with my morning coffee and i thought ""What did people do when they were bored *before* the current state of the internet?""

By current state, i mean before 2000ish. The ""tube"" sites didn't appear until around 2005, and smart phone that were capable of being pocket computers didn't really come until 2007.

Nowadays we have fully functional computers gorilla glued to our hips.

A common reason why a lot of guys watch it is because they are ""bored"".

Well before things are the way the way they are now people did things that were at least enjoyable *and* productive for the most...you might read, tend to your garden, listen to the radio, watch a movie, go talk to the locals and regulars at the bar/coffee shop, do puzzles, play a video game, play an instrument etc.

The worst i can think of that isn't a drug would be watching brain rot TV (Jerry Springer), Trash Radio (Howard Stern), or playing mindlessly violent video games (Debatable depending on your views on gaming).

Out of boredom some people might get into drugs, alcohol, gangbanging, etc. obviously those are bad and don't really do much for yourself or city, Any drug, or otherwise dangerous/addictive activity or substance, taken to excess, will tear apart yourself and family, some quicker than others. 

Its one thing to get a few drinks at happy hour with the guys, its another to get *wrecked* daily, resulting you to be mean to your partner, show up late for work, neglect yourself and household, etc.

People will argue that there is a safe ammount of ""x"" substance or activity, but really what ends up happening is they are a functional addict until the wheels, inevitably, fall off. For porn, this means joining the mf goon gang and just accepting it.

Currently, we use the Nespresso Vertuo as well as a Nespresso Pixie to get ""shots"" to use for milk based drinks, such as Iced Caramel Macchiato's, Brown Sugar Shaken Espresso's, and etc. We mainly use the shots we pull for **iced drinks**, and yes, we do use a hyper chiller to not water down our coffee. 

Occasionally, I do drink plain espresso shot's, as well as some of my family members, however a large portion of our espresso consumption (\~80%) goes to making iced drinks. 

Some of our favorite Nespresso pod's include: 

* [Nespresso Double Espresso Scuro](https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/order/capsules/vertuo/double-espresso-scuro-vertuo-coffee-pods)
* [Nespresso Diavolitto](https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/order/capsules/vertuo/diavolitto-vertuo-espresso-pods)
* [Nespresso Il Caffè](https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/order/capsules/vertuo/il-caffe-coffee-pods)
* [Nespresso OL Scuro](https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/order/capsules/original/nespresso-barista-creations-scuro-coffee-capsules)

I am concerned about switching to a manual espresso machine because so far, most of the shots that we have tried from espresso machine's, whether it be at a relatives house or a restaurant, or the fully automatic espresso machine we were gifted for our house warming party, taste so watered-down compared to the Nespresso shot's and the Nespresso shot's have a more artificial coffee flavoring(?) to them? I'm not sure if I captured that taste correctly lol. 

**My #1 question is, is it possible to pull a better tasting espresso shot with a manual machine, than with a Nespresso machine, especially if the coffee will be used in milk based, iced drinks?** We tried so many different beans, from local roasters, to George Howell, to supermarket beans, nothing we tried had a **strong coffee** taste like Nespresso.

If so, I have a fully automatic espresso machine (sku 0132215281) but the grinder is broken. I can choose to replace it myself (for about $120) or, it was my birthday recently and I got a $200 Macy’s gift card. I'm thinking of purchasing the Breville Bambino, just because everyone says it’s a super good entry level espresso machine, and it's not fully automatic.

So assuming my numbers in the Watts/Amps table are correct what are the recommendations for the controllers (I'm looking for WLED with Sound Reactive) and power supplies that aren't going to be super costly as I'll need 5 controllers and at least 5 power supplies assuming I can power each section independently. For the buffet and coffee table I can mount stuff under but trying to keep it as small as possible due to them having to be mounted on the underneath side.

Also what gauge wire should I be using between the runs to connect the strips?

While the key to success lies in consistency and patience, there are some strategies you can implement to accelerate your weight loss naturally:

# 1. Eat Whole, Unprocessed Foods

https://preview.redd.it/jg4daqym3rud1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=999ce7189f28c2bbf4d80bef09a826045df23e7a

Focus on consuming nutrient-dense, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins (chicken, fish, eggs), and whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, oats). These foods are naturally lower in calories and packed with nutrients that support overall health and weight loss. Avoid processed foods and sugary snacks, which are high in empty calories.

# 2. Increase Protein Intake

https://preview.redd.it/5lh9fqqzbrud1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af2b3908233366dc91bff83f00fa374338ee99b4

Protein is known to boost metabolism, reduce appetite, and help preserve muscle mass during weight loss. Include lean meats, eggs, legumes, and nuts in your meals. A higher protein intake can make you feel fuller longer, reducing the temptation to snack on unhealthy foods.

# 3. Cut Back on Refined Carbs and Sugars

https://preview.redd.it/hv5xebb9crud1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daf6d16b92c0d12113c91109b95c72eb0f911662

Refined carbs, such as white bread, pasta, and sugary treats, can cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, leading to cravings and overeating. Replace these with complex carbs like whole grains, sweet potatoes, and vegetables, which provide sustained energy and keep you feeling full.

# 4. Practice Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting (IF) involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. Popular methods include the 16:8 method (16 hours of fasting and an 8-hour eating window) or the 5:2 method (eating normally for five days and consuming minimal calories for two days). IF can help reduce calorie intake, improve metabolism, and promote fat burning.

# 5. Stay Hydrated

Drinking water can help boost your metabolism, reduce hunger, and aid in digestion. Aim for at least 8 cups of water a day, and consider drinking a glass before meals to help with portion control. Replace sugary beverages with water, herbal teas, or infused water for a low-calorie alternative.

# 6. Increase Physical Activity

Incorporate regular exercise into your routine to burn calories and boost your metabolism. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate to intense exercise daily. This can include walking, running, cycling, swimming, or strength training. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is especially effective for quick fat burning, as it alternates between bursts of intense activity and brief rest periods.

# 7. Prioritize Sleep

Sleep plays a crucial role in weight management. Lack of sleep can disrupt the hormones that regulate hunger and appetite, making you more likely to overeat. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to support your body’s recovery and balance hunger hormones like leptin and ghrelin.

# 8. Reduce Stress

High stress levels trigger the release of cortisol, a hormone that can increase appetite and promote fat storage, especially around the belly area. Practice stress-relief techniques like meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or spending time in nature to keep cortisol levels in check.

# 9. Control Portions and Practice Mindful Eating

Eat slowly and pay attention to your body’s hunger and fullness cues. Avoid eating out of boredom or stress and focus on the food you’re consuming. Mindful eating can help prevent overeating and make you more aware of how much you’re eating.

# 10. Eliminate Sugary Beverages

Sugary drinks, including soda, energy drinks, and fruit juices, can add a significant amount of calories to your diet without making you feel full. Replace these with water, unsweetened tea, or black coffee to reduce calorie intake.

# 11. Try a Caloric Deficit

For fast weight loss, maintain a caloric deficit — meaning you consume fewer calories than your body needs to maintain its current weight. While a 500-calorie deficit per day is a safe way to lose about 1 pound per week, be careful not to lower your intake too drastically, as this can lead to muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies, and slowed metabolism.

# Conclusion

Losing weight naturally and quickly requires a holistic approach that includes eating nutrient-rich foods, staying active, managing stress, and getting enough sleep. By making these healthy lifestyle changes, you’ll not only shed pounds but also support your long-term well-being.

She just moved in with the girls a few weeks ago as they are all starting new jobs. They all met on Facebook too. 

I'd like to think that we, as a couple, are pretty chill about most things and I have made sure to not stay at her flat often (only like 1/2 nights every other week max) so that she could get to know her new flatmates better and get settled in. 

Now, the flatmates are both single and decided to have a party at the flat whilst we were both at my parents house - where I am currently living. That's all good and we're happy for them to party, whatever. But the flatmates decided to use my girlfriend's coffee machine and drinks (didn't tell her - she had to find out herself), as well as have coke in the shared area (my gf says she's not bothered about this but we both don't do drugs). 

Whilst all of this is happening, the flatmates change their Hinge prompt to ""come to our flat party"" and invite random guys to come into the flat - who bring more friends with them both boys and girls. We both didn't enjoy that there were strangers who could've easily stolen valuable items from my gfs room whilst she wasn't there and this made us very uncomfortable. 

Are we overreacting? Or is this a perfectly reasonable complaint? and how do you set the boundaries without causing a divide between the flatmates so early on?

Yet only moved around 40 or so minutes away from it. Into an equally nosey/small town. Now as a teenager this made sense as her options were limited and she was able to work and live close to Rory. 

But I think at some point she could've considered moving someone more urban. Like nyc, that has good coffee/pizza to name a few. And much more independence/anonymity. Rory definitely would've thrived in the city. On public transport and so many places in walking distance. - Similar to Stars Hollow. But still very different. She also would've had more opportunities there. Maybe not compared to Chilton but definitely to Stars Hallow High which is where she would've been assumed to attend most of her life. 

Moving to NY may not have been realistic/easy after living and working at the inn for the first 3+ years of Rorys life. But it would've bene interesting to see.

I've been using this for a little over a year now. The 9bar was my first foray into making espresso at home, and there are a lot of things I really like about it. The simplicity, design, and easily user serviceable nature are what drew me to it in the first place and definitely what I love about it. I am able to reliably get good (imo) shots out of it repeatedly with only a few little tweaks to the grinder when I change beans. The Lido is built for life and the adjustability and consistency is excellent (not that I have a lot to compare it to though, but it's leagues ahead of the 1zpresso grinder I use for aeropress).

  
Things I'm looking to improve:

* Shot time/ease: the 9bar is great and simple for making a shot, but is about 8-10min between when I put the boiler on and pouring the coffee into a cup. Right now I don't find myself making coffee at home on work days since I'm out the door super early in the AM and I just don't want to spend the time that early. Having something that can turn on early with a timer plug and be ready to go so I can bang out a quick coffee at 4AM while I make a second for the roaddd would be the dream.
* Flexibility: The 9bar is awesome at doing what it does and is extremely repeatable, but it is limited in most ways. Some small amount of flexibility on the brewing process would be nice just to try out some different things.

Things I'd like to keep:

* Ease - I'm not interested in coffee as a science or changing every little variable. I want some flexibility (as mentioned above) but also ease and consistency. I don't know if those two things are opposing forces, but maybe this sort of thing exists??
* Maintenance and User serviceability - the thing that attracted me to the 9bar initially was the simplicity of the user serviceable parts, and the low number of wear items in the design. I'm a mechanical guy and am weary of all these fancy computer controlled valved machines that when they break will require a huge/expensive effort to fix either in parts or specialized labor hours due to the complexity. I'm pretty handy and have no problem getting elbow deep in repairs when things go wrong, but lots of electronic and complex parts start to ramp up the difficulty on what you can do at home in my experience. Maybe this is just my ignorance in this area and it really isn't that bad? Happy to hear some thoughts
* Consistency - the 9bar is super consistent, allowing me to dial some other variables in to get a good shot quick quickly, and I really appreciate this.
* Quality - I'm a buy for life-er. I'd like this machine/grinder to last for a long time with some basic maintenance from me. I know it probably gets said a lot around here but I'd like this to be likely the last machine I'll have to buy for a very long time, if not ever.

  
I mostly drink my espresso straight, 1-2 shots a day. My partner has a 1 shot americano daily and the occasional cappuccino on a gloomy weekend; so steam would be a nice tertiary thing, but definitely isn't a requirement since it would be maybe a once in a month thing. Mostly prefer medium-ish roasts with the occasional dark or light to switch it up.

Counter space isn't a huge issue. I don't want an absolute unit of a machine, but I have no vertical space requirements.

I'm more inclined to mechanical machines due to some of the points I make below (maintenance, serviceability) but I'm open to either.

Budget: let's say under 5k

Am I chasing something crazy? Do I just keep what I have? I plan on keeping my current set-up for sure, likely to go on car camping adventures for some nice morning espresso in the woods that takes up almost no space in the kitchen box.

What advice do you WISH you had received before dropping paychecks into the hobby?

  
**The origin story (we all have one):**

I started off a very long time ago when I was looking for organic perfume after deciding that's what I need - organic perfume - because I can't wear toxic department store perfume. This led me to Solstice Scents Lavender raspberry truffle. Listed as natural - so I thought 'why not!' and found that I really did enjoy it but something was slightly off about it. Then I went on an organic perfume Etsy journey, but started to realize my perfumes just were not lasting very long.

I then went outside the organic realm but stayed within the small, indie zone. I learned that I could still wear these perfumes.

I tried Alkemia, discovered some scents that I thought were really cool (honored ghosts, smoke and mirrors), but then what really sent me into the rabbit hole was Arcana's two finger ballet. 

I was like ""holy s\*\*\* - this is insane"". I never thought perfume could smell LIKE THAT - and that's when I can for sure say I became addicted. I think constantly seeking out that same reaction. It was intense dopamine. That's why this hobby is so much like gambling. I won that day. I could have stopped there and just bought TFB forevermore but nope!

Fast forward to endless sampling buying. Or blind-buy fullsizes, because I trusted a house based on one good perfume but then the others ended up disappointing me. A house can have one amazing gourmand and the rest are just blah.

There are notes which I very clearly have to avoid. I cannot handle labdanum, patchouli or vetiver. 

There are perfumes from Alkemia that give me mental images of a great-grandmother who is very obviously a witch and hexes people and has an herb cupboard hiding away these tiny 5ml bottles of perfume that just complete her entire character. Like why wouldn't she be wearing Evil Temptress?

Those do not work for me. You know what ended up working for me from Alkemia? Her masculine scents, because they smell amazing on my boyfriend. I love them on him - not on me. So that brings in the whole chemistry aspect that you will often times see us talking about. Those notes that I hate actually smell pretty good on him! In small amounts.



**My advice:**

**DO NOT DO THIS! Do not blind buy a fullsize.** I absolutely LOVE NAVA, Astrid and Arcana but just because one perfume worked for me, does not mean the rest will.

  
The ONLY time you can blind buy a fullsize is if you know for sure there is a market for that perfume and you will be able to easily destash it. Sorce's match made in heaven is probably the best example. If you list that fullsize, someone is going to grab it up. The samples, too.

The perfumes that I like are popular on this sub. It is easy to destash them. If you have unique tastes and enjoy unisex or masculine-leaning scents, it is going to be more difficult. 

  
**DO NOT FALL FOR FOMO!**

I fall for it all the time! NAVA feels predatory just for how many times I have been bamboozled by their new releases.

Sample them. They also come back the next year. Many of those scents are recycled and used in new scents. They definitely upcycle unused stock. You will be able to get it again!

My favorite from NAVA was strawberry cheescake - but strawberry crystalline smells nearly the same.

Where can you get samples? Ajevie, Crypta Obscura and Arae! There are definitely others out there for different houses that carry samples - decanting is a business, and we need to support these businesses because they are offering a service that will help us tremendously to cut down on the spending.

Check the destashes - when we order from decanters, we will add the samples to our destash. The NAVA seasonals are around long enough that you will have time to wait for a destash sample to appear. Though I do recommending buying directly from a decanter in the event that no one wants to give up their treasures.

  
**BUY THE POPULAR/RECOMMMENDED SCENT SAMPLES FIRST!!!!!**

I cannot stress this more. This Reddit is a resource. I will type a perfume house or scent into the search to try and get a good idea of which perfumes to try first. That's how I knew to try honored ghosts from Alkemia.

Even if you do not like the scent, you will learn which notes to avoid.

I learned that even though Silken Tent and Salome have rave reviews - they do not work for me. At all.

If you are thinking about trying a perfume, type the name into the search bar and see if anyone has reviewed it. Sort the comments by newest usually - it depends if you're looking for reviews or destash mentions.

  
**Keep an Excel file of the perfumes you have tried and put each different note into a column.**

1 for yes, 0 for no. Or you could even go by strength.

That way you can filter by notes and figure out which ones you really do not like!

  
**BEFORE YOU FULLSIZE, ASK YOURSELF:**

If you could only have one perfume for the rest of your life, which perfume would it be?

Mine might be Poesie's lavender condensed milk rice pudding.. or Solstice Scents Chiffon.

  
So do you REALLY need to fullsize this - how often will it be used compared to your main perfume?

  
Of course, some of us collect perfume bottles as if they are Pokemon, so that question might not apply.

  
**Do not feel bad after being disappointed..**

Destash it!

Or give it away - someone might not be able to afford indie perfumes but wants to try them.

Do you have lots of friends? Ask them if they want to try. Book club? Tell them you have lots of super cool perfume samples and see if they want to try them.

Casually bring up perfume when you're out having coffee with a friend. They might say they'd love to try indie perfumes, and that is when you drop your bag of sample vials onto the table like a treasure goblin and ask which ones they want to try first.



**Other things to know:**

If you have not found your ""main"", then keep sampling, but do not sample blindly. This is a research project. Do not buy samples just because - you should have an idea of what you generally like or dislike after a few sample bundle purchases.

Let the samples rest a few weeks if needed. Some houses definitely need a resting period.

I have had some perfumes become less attractive after a year. It just happens. They evolve over time, you might not like them anymore and you will wish you had sampled and revisited the sample to find out that it just doesn't smell as good anymore!

EDP has better shelf life. So if you do want to purchase a fullsize oil, you need to be able to use it up!

Every house is different. You might hate lavender from one house but enjoy it from another.

Some houses are trying to achieve ""classic"" or ""vintage"" style (Alkemia) while others are trying to achieve realism. So when one house uses ""cake"" as a note, it might smell nothing like real cake, but another house uses the same words and their cake note smells like CAKE.

You will become better at detecting synthetic smells over time and may or may not like those. Something might remind you of a candle, which is when we begin throwing around ""fragrance oil"" in our reviews, or plastick-y, or synthetic. That's what we are referring to. Some are ok with that, some are not. I personally get nausea from plastick-y scents, so I stick to a few houses that have not given me a reaction yet.

Some notes might just make you sick no matter what! Cherry blossom from all houses is just nausea-inducing for me.

1g3l6kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intentionalcommunity/comments/1g3l6kj/an_invitation_to_cocreate/,An Invitation to Co-Create,"My name is Lorena, born and raised in Tapachula, Chiapas México.

For the past four years, I’ve had the privilege of nurturing Alma Mactzil, a community and retreat center whose essence is captured in its name, born out of the words *Alma* (meaning “soul” in Spanish) and *Mactzil* (meaning “miracle” in Mayan), offering an opportunity to *self-explore, transform, and grow* through solitary retreats and community living, opening the doors of our home to those seeking a sanctuary of peace, healing and security.

Surrounded by Waterfalls and the Tacaná Volcano in the state of Chiapas in Southern México, we are only a short distance (10 km) from Tapachula, a friendly city bustling with markets and natural beauty around from Mayan pyramids, la ruta del café, waterfalls, hotsprings, mangroves, Tacana Volcano, rivers and beaches.

This property has been in my family for over a century, once serving as my grandparents' coffee farm. For the past few years, I have called this place home, creating a space for transformational retreats and sharing the wisdom of my ancestors and this land with those who seek healing, peace, and community. Now, however, my life is calling me in new directions. I’m working in the city and diving deep into a master’s degree in psycho-oncology—a passion that fuels me but also requires more of my time and focus. 

Though I live only 20 minutes away, balancing the demands of logistics, community members and a volunteer program along with my work and studies has become too much for me to sustain on my own.This is where you come in. 

Alma Mactzil is ready for someone (or a few someones!) who feel called to continue this journey. I would love to connect with people who feel a genuine desire to create community and hold space for those seeking healing and connection. 

Whether you’re interested in renting, partnering, or finding a creative way to collaborate, my heart is open to new possibilities. I’ll always be nearby, happy to support and co-create in ways that feel right for us both.If you feel drawn to the spirit of this place and sense a pull to help shape its future, I’d be honored to share more. Let’s talk, dream, and imagine together what the next chapter of Alma Mactzil might look like.  With love and excitement,  
Lorena

We have another family room that has a tv, so we don't plan on putting one in this room. The piano has to stay in this room, but the couch and everything else does not, but we would like to keep the couch here if we can make it fit nicely. That random cabinet is not staying here. We know we need more furniture, I'm open to buying whatever is needed, more chairs, bookshelves, coffee table, etc. Was also thinking about possibly hanging 2 or 3 guitars on the walls if it works somewhere? 



How would you style this room? It feels like everything we try just looks weird. Thanks!

1g3l68s,https://www.reddit.com/r/bunheadsnark/comments/1g3l68s/ballet_with_isabellas_interview_with_chloe/,Ballet with Isabella's interview with Chloe Misseldine ,"Buckle in, this is a one hour interview. Since I've recapped a few of her interviews recently I'm going to focus on writing things that we haven't heard before. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bunheadsnark/comments/1fkag1v/chloe_misseldines_new_podcast_episode_recap/) is a post I made for another interview with some overlap in conversation to this one. I didn't feel like writing it twice haha. 

* She feels she's a stage dancer not a studio dancer. She gets better and grows on stage. 
* Her 2017 YAGP silver medal was her first competition outside of Florida. 
* Yan works on fundamental basics on how to dance and move not just technique. Musicality and Coordination is what she taught her from a young age. 
* Her mom put her in piano and that was super important for musicality and being one with the music (OMG as someone with a degree in piano, I can absolutely see that in her dancing! She dances exactly how I would play the music). 
* Fundamental basics is the most important thing. She still struggles with it even today. It's important to work with the young dancer individually and patience is the most important thing since corrections might not happen immediately. Note: What are fundamental basics of ballet in comparison to technique? 
* There was a large apartment donated to ABT studio company. There usually is 8-10 dancers both male and female who live together. 
* In studio company, she danced Giselle, Don Q, Tarantella, an excerpt from Pas de action from La Bayadere (Gamzatti role). She feels her largest growth was during the studio company, it was her first time doing PDD with Codas etc. 
* When she entered the main company it's different from stuco as it is a lot of standing around and learning as opposed to dancing. When she first arrived, Ratmansky was choreographing a new ballet (Of Love and Rage) and she just remembers standing there for 7 hours watching but not actually being in the studio dancing. It was difficult but a learning experience but stuco prepared us for that new reality. 
* For Bernstein in a Bubble there was only going to be one cast for the fall season but Cat Hurlin got injured so she stepped in about 2 weeks before. 
* She felt a lot of pressure taking on leading roles and even smaller roles like Bernstein because she was 3 weeks into being a corp de ballet member and had never danced with most of these principal dancers. She was intimidated by the situation and being in the room with Ratmansky. She loved working with him. She turns pressure into excitement for new opportunities. When it comes to performance or full run throughs in the studio, she does get nervous but more excited. She tends to feel more nervous or stressed if she's underprepared. 
* Her mom always reassures her about performances but it does come down to herself. She trusts herself and stays calm. Performing a lot and getting comfortable on the stage is so important. Isabelle says she has talked to many principal dancers now and the common thread is they all trust themselves and feel excitement even through pressure. 
* She likes artsy things, like painting pottery, sketching, photography, knitting etc. She lives next to central park so she likes to stroll over there quite a bit. She does like to try new restaurants by herself. 

**Swan Lake Debut**

* She found out in August of 2023 that she was debuting O/O in Feb 2024 at the Kennedy Center. 
* She felt so much excitement of getting the opportunity but she also felt the trust that Susan Jaffe had in her, that she was ready to dance O/O. She had never danced anything like this while at ABT. She was nervous but felt reassured that Jaffe thought she was ready to tackle this. 
* She had a month to a month and a half to mentally prepare before we started rehearsing and learning. 
* She started rehearsing in the fall of 2023, September- December to get a feel for the character. She had a few rehearsals with Jaffe at the time but she was also preparing for her other fall roles and nutcracker. 
* In January 2024, she dove head on into rehearsals. Every hour she was thinking about the ballet. She made it her whole personality for herself during rehearsals. She involved her world around it, she put all of her focus into it. 
* She worked with Susan every day of every week one on one in January/February. Susan spoon fed her the ballet. They worked every day on what works for her, how she should approach a step, where ot put her hand, how do I look into my partners eye. Jaffe is big on connection and chemistry between the two characters because its a love story. Not only is the technique important but the connection between the two is equally as important. She really felt what Jaffe wanted to bring out of her and Aran. In the beginning it took time to get comfortable but once you feel it, feel the connection, it was so eye opening and exciting. The process was so enjoyable because of that. Every day, so many hours, Aran was so gracious and patient with her. They would take white swan PDD apart, break it down into sections and dissect it. She is so grateful to him, she felt confident that Aran had her even if she was off of her leg. 
* Susan was very keen on having Odette being this very nice, innocent, naive sad swan and Odile to be this seductive siren. She wanted both characters t obe different. Odette came easier to Chloe, but Odile took more time to find the character and the difference between the two. 
* For February, Odile was not as strong as she would like it. For the MET Odile was much better. For February she focused more on Odette but between Feb-July she worked more on Odile. 
* The tough part for her was managing Act II and Act III on the same day. Pointe shoes, two or one? Stamina? etc. It wasn't as bad as she thought it would be performing. 
* ABT's Act III is basically all on the left leg so it is a lot. 
* Before her debut, an order of her pointe shoes didn't arrive. Three weeks before her debut she had no pointe shoes. She was stressing and crying in the dressing room at ABT like ""What do I do?"" She had one pair of shoes she saved for the show. She didn't even know if they were going to be good but trusted that they would hold her over. Two weeks before the show she had three pairs of half dead to dead shoes and wearing them over and over again. 
* For Act II tech and Act III run through she was wearing extremely soft shoes but she got through it. This is unheard of, but it is what it is haha. The core strength to hold herself up was crazy though haha. 
* She wore the same pair of shoes the whole show because she had none. She kept the shoes obviously because it is sentimental. 
* Everything worked out obviously, she was so excited and everyone pumped her up and rooted for her.  
* For performances like this, she wakes up early to give herself as much time as possible to prepare. For her NY debut she was so happy with the performance. There were so many things that were better compared to her debut. 

**Promotion** 

* She had her whole family in the audience, she's bowing on stage and she sees Susan Jaffe in the wings with a mic. It was insane to be promoted on stage, it was the last thing she expected. The audience is all standing and clapping and she feels like its a dream. She felt a flood of emotions, she took all the bows and the curtain closes. Then the corps de ballet ran to her and hugged her. Emma Zordan took a lot of photos of that moment. Kevin Mckenzie was there also and came backstage to hug her. Her family came backstage to hug her. Sascha and Stella were there along with her donors and her best friends etc. backstage. 
* Her goal was to become principal dancer one day, but it's not the end. She's so young so there's so much to work on technically, artistically and as a person. There is is so much to achieve afterwards and she wants to live up to the title of principal. 
* Truly, she only ever felt support. ABT is very special, she's heard stories from past generations of ABT dancers with jealousy and young dancers being promoted fast. At ABT, she's always felt supported and everyone is kind. They truly are family. She wants to stay at ABT because of the dancing and the community. She says ABT is always a good time, and they have a lot of fun together. 
* Two weeks later they had in studio promotions which was a special moment for the dancers. They truly deserved it, they did their time and work. One of the dancers came up and said you should have been announced. She told them like she got her moment at her performance. 
* She feels different being a principal but not in a bad way. She approaches roles differently, she tries to be more mature in a way. She tries to channel her youthful energy in a grounded way. She tries to approach her work in a mature way. 
* For night performances she always does a ballet class in the morning, a short rehearsal to move the muscles, take a nap and then go to the stage and do hair/makeup. She does love to have a coffee before her performances. 
* Isabelle said that Chloe has a soft quality to her, a real elegance that is quite rare. But she also has so much energy, passion and drama and she really goes for things. She says Chloe's arms are very beautifully soft. 
* Chloe says when people are watching her it makes her dance her best. She likes that vulnerability on stage. 
* She feels that her second london show wasn't quite as good as the first one. She says it was her first time dancing two full lengths back to back. She felt her first one was stronger.

DISCLAIMER UPDATE: *I'm not recommending taking collagen peptides (although I do), but it's been discussed often here. It's been noted by commenters that lipedema can be, or is, an overproduction of collagen. Medical doctors don't seem to have a consensus about whether patients should take them.*   
  
I have been taking collagen peptides (in coffee and in bone broth) for over a year. Does it help?

1. I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome so I feel it keeps me from having aches and pains which I've had since a teenager. So yes, it helps EDS by reducing inflammation IMHO.
2. Lipedema - well, my legs are getting less lumpy but that is probably due to a combination of things. Collagen peptides heal leaky gut, which ultimately heals the rest of the body because you digest and absorb more nutrients.

Collagen peptides help create connective tissue, which I believe in lipedema is weak. So would taking any amount be beneficial unless contraindicated by MCAS (thank you, Redditor)...?

I have a naturopathic doctor who doesn't feel one way or another about collagen powders - if it were up to him, people would drink bone broth only and not buy powders, but I like powders to mix in coffee and smoothies. That said, he would suggest we buy organic, grass-fed and grass-finished products, but buy what you like.

I buy [Horbäach ""Multi Collagen Protein"" powder](https://www.amazon.com/Collagen-Peptides-Flavorless-Friendly-Horbaach/dp/B087775RX7/ref=sr_1_1_pp?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kGuTpcVeq8XY_OSpMrrkgIsG-Vfr5bHDveGpjKV-Cot460HSLkN1SQ66P9ycR6X1oU391KaeVipdKCqaR8bnAumfNEIkiRaxnxloxhuMRiFor6fBKRM3Yc4MDGHKh-2ayIctdlOt1zGTvvOmvk615QKIQlrt4wbIYWTmA5TREMMZ4rb1k_cUpe_YKWIO_zhrYaKRxFhxUcixKmduIxOAIjLskcBwboVfYnjux97yfIk07Iu4HU8FnZLRlsOJriUIKOInwDZiEC8COlOUPhYbtFGlrrI3o2QURGZDIauy9xA.QGBiPHP7Fl9badYMo6lpTTBEn9Q-c5tHSDITcGnuo3M&dib_tag=se&hvadid=707412108920&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9010167&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=4309221905048647163&hvtargid=kwd-2330478044054&hydadcr=21909_13323174&keywords=horb%C3%A4ach+multi+collagen+protein&qid=1728923710&sr=8-1) that includes Types I, II, III, V and X (sources: bovine, chicken, fish and eggshell).

I take a scoop of EACH every day....some vanilla in coffee, some unflavored in warm liquids/broth. I feel like I need a double 'dose' daily because of EDS and it isn't making lipedema worse! I'm still in the process of slimming down, and weight loss in general should be supported by some kind of collagen booster at my age (post-menopausal) since we tend to have saggy chicken skin LOL!

If you ask a medical doctor what types of collagen you need (I, II, V??) they won't know....which is why I got a naturopath that does know!

Okay so, I can say I'm pretty diffixult person when it comes ti terms of feelings. It's hard for me to catch them and even when I do it's never too deep. But the biggest problem is the fact that I never admit them to myself and that's what makes my life confusing.

My family never really ""banned"" me from anything except that I have a curfew (whixh is 10 pm and isn't too bad tbh and I get it) but lately they've all been acting like I'm some kind of liar and that I have secret meetings with my ""boyfriend"" (which I've never had) whenever I go out with friends ( I literarly have 2-3 friends lol)

And my sister lately came up with the theory that I'm in a secret relationship with this random guy from my class, let's call him M, which I never shown any interest in and the other way around, and haven't even spoke to him more than once I guess? And I couldn't care less about him and she keeps talking about our relationship to our parents, who subcounciously started believing her.

Ok, and I was like why everybody thinks that I have better love life than I do?😅 

I was really in love only as a child, later ot were just flings and I could never bring ymself to tell my friend about them (because mostly they were flings, she's not too trustworthy and she's basically in love with everything male walking around, and I don't want to break girls code but like... can I have anyone in this damn universe? And i don't admit such things to myself mostly) Lol, but it's fine since I never cared enough much, and neither did she about em, but still..

🤠A few days ago, she came up to me and said that she has important news that have something to do only with me, that it's serious, tooo shoxking, and actually great but she doesn't know how wpuld I react?
And I immediately  figured out it's probbably something about my love life, maybe somebody admiting their fewlings for me through a friend (what otger logic explanation?)

And I was right, we couldn't meet that day and I was overthinking all the time in anticipation. And somehow I realised I was subcounciously hoping it was this one guy (let's call him M2-same name as one before lol) we usually talk to during our lunch breaks, for whom I ha e mixed. Feelings about I can't figure out. Am I into him? Wouldn't really say so, but I feel some kind of connection exists maybe, our energies are on the same level somehow, we have so much in common and basically he's not too perfect but he meets my standards (smart, funny, art soul). I realised we're good for each other, but when we're together I don't have any ""feeling"" you lnow. Maybe he's just a close friend. I never usually see him otherwise when it's not lunch, for about 5 mins every day, once I gathered courage when I saw him and one other friend of mine  ending school at the same time (rarely happens since we go to doffferent high schools) and got an idea for me and best friend to ask them if the ywpuld join us for a coffee (we headed ro cafe anyways)
And they politely refused, more precisely M2's friend, they said they were exhausted and I believe so, since one of them just had PE and it was moring school so everybody's tired. And I lost all my hope and felt kind of awkward after that, it's not important but I rarely give people amy chances and he lost that one if he really felt something, so taht's it.

I realised that that day I kind of wished he was the one talking to my bestie, since noone else seemed logic. And Then I was schocked when I found out the real answer the other day!

No it was not M2, It was a guy L from my class who is a friend of M (if you understand anything here, sorry😅) Anyways I couldn't believe it since That guy barely ever spoke to me, md the other way around (and no I'm not some popular girl people are affraid to talk to lol) we just never even had a proper conversation after a year of going to class together.  Like how did you even start liking me? I mean I'm not too much diffferent in school.and house but still, how did you get to know me? Or did you just figure out I was ""good match"" and decided it could work out.


Anyways I was kind of schocked in a bad way, since I always thought of him as weird and confused (trust me I'm both but not on that level), but he's not a bad person, I guess, physically he's strong and big and. Taht's good but somehow I just ugh, he's not my type of person from what I've known about him. But still, I don't really know him well and it would be very unfair from.me to dump him and don't even give him a chance to talk to me or get to know me (and then decidewhat to do). HE told my friend that he likes me and that she shouldn't tell me (maybe she really shouldn't have) and that he wants her to be his wiimngwoman or something and wants her to find out about what I think of him/feel idk. And I told her tk write that we didn't know each other and that I didn't talk about him much when she mentioned him since me and L aren't really close (which really is true)
But I really appreciate that he confessed his feelings and decided that he's the one who should take a first step and all that (which is standard but many men aren't ready to do that these days) and he said something like ""I choose her the most"" and ""I want to win her over"", she tolf himt o take it slow and he said something like ""10 km/h"". That's kin dof cute somehow I guess.

And I've spent whole last day thinking about it, and today when I showd up at schoool he didn't even dare to talk to me (again) and I didn't make effort either, It's not me who have such feelings. I just comtinued to live life as before. We did some ""project"" (I can't say together because he just stood there and tried to help a bit, and art is my area so), but at school I just realised, ugh damn, I don't know what kind of getting to know each other would make me fall for him. He's not a bad guy, I just don't think he's the right for me, and taht he's actually able to win the prize he wants (he's always like that, even woth studying, says he's read, that he knows everything, and then takes a test and get pretty bad grades)

Given to the fact that I'm somehow emotionally weird and hardly fall in love, have straight eyes, my standards, but social anxiety and don't know too many people from opposite sex (as close friends) and what the worst thing is we go to the same class- us being together is humiliating enough, imagine our break-up. And tbh it's not about what other people will say/think, but about the fact that if I think that t such relationship of mine would be cringe, if so do I really need it?

I'm sorry. For boghering everyone amd making you read my whole life haha, but I just had to collect my thoughts, and even ask for some advice since even my friend (who is his new ally) is on his side only because of that.. and since there is noone I can confide in.. 
If you have some advice or view on the situation, I'd appreciate it even though it's all my decision after all.
I think I'm not gonna do anything, if the God's will reall is for me and L to be together, then I'll probbably develop feelings in the future or smth,...
But. The fact that I know about it just makes things weird, even though I do not really notice him in class, I still can't help but think about it all when I see him. I don't wanna hurt him, but I doubt his feelings are strong enough, letting him develop them and then leaving him may hurt even more, but being unfair and not giving him a chance?

And what about me? Lowering my standards? Letting myself be something to win? Hell no, or am I looking at the situation weirdly?",1,1728925246.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I know they're hanging out, or 2.) I know they are ""exes"".","Hey all! Here today asking for advice on how I should handle a situation between me(F20) and my girlfriend(F20). Apologies in advance for the big ass walls of text, it's a lot of context.

We've been dating for over a year now. Before her I had never dated or even been with anyone sexually, she's my first everything. She on the other hand has been with her fair share of people, I don't have a number I just know it's high. She's *always* told me there were never serious, just hookups, fwb's, and a couple situationships.

For context: She lets me borrow her iPad often, which I did a lot over the summer since she didn't need it for school work. We've always been super relaxed about messages. She's taken my phone and scrolled through convos in front of me before, and I've done the same. We're comfortable we wont find anything, so it's honestly just joking banter. Her coworkers have even asked her if she's okay with me using her iPad since I can access her messages, and she's always said ""Yeah ofc, she wont find anything so why would I be concerned?""

Well, over the summer I got curious and was bored at work. I searched up the keyword of my name and then searched up ""girlfriend"" just to see what she was saying about me to other people. I really didn't think I would find *anything*. I stumbled across a couple girls who were clearly hookups or fwbs, but that doesn't bother me cause it's in the past/she doesn't talk to them anymore/it was never serious. Lo and behold I eventually saw what looked like an intense breakup exchange.  
Turns out she had a previous relationship (and I mean, official GFs) *right before* we became official. As in, the same day I asked her out and told her to drop her roster, she ended it. I'll call the girl Z.  
From what I can tell, they were in a friend group together and later started fucking around. It started as fwb but Z caught hard feelings, and confessed to my gf on some trip they group took. Eventually my gf said she liked her too, and they tried dating. They clearly weren't into each other the same level. I saw in other texts (between my gf and other people) that they would fight a lot, and my gf didn't even seem to enjoy hanging out with Z half the time (things like her saying she was bored, or wanted to leave Z's place). After they broke up, they would still text each other randomly. Majority of it was my gf initiating small talk.  
Around the time she started posting me more, Z reached out and said it hurt her a lot, so she wanted to be no contact for a while.

Well. 3 months later my gf texts her asking about Kratom, and if Z still had some, could she borrow a little for period cramps. The night Z came by to drop it off, me and my gf were at her apartment making dinner. I didn't have pants on so when Z got there, my gf went outside to take it. They talked for at least 45 minutes-1hr. All I knew was that this was a friend she hadn't seen in a while, so they ended up taking a minute to catch up outside. (Honestly, I was a little upset that I didn't even get a text saying it would take more than 10 minutes since our dinner was getting cold..)

Some more context lol: There have been two instances where I was *explicitly* made aware about her existence: When Z sent the text about going no contact my gf had told me about it, saying smth like ""Omg I got this long text from a girl I used to fuck around with"". I asked to see it, she seemed uncomfortable, so I stopped pressing. She didn't tell me her name or anything.  
Second time was when Z cut her hair short, my gf showed me her Instagram and was jokingly like ""Look at this girl I used to fuck around with, after I broke things off she took it pretty hard and now she's going masc"".

Back to current day. I went to put her iPad to charge while she's at work, and her messages were open. I did a little scroll and see Z's name. My gf had texted her about the hurricane in Florida, saying she hopes Z's relatives who live there are safe. They talk a little, Z says they should catch up soon, and they make plans for this Wednesday to grab a coffee. The time my gf picked is the exact time I go into work that day.  
Before that they had been texting a little, most of it started by Z recommending a show or talking about random shit.

My dilemma: My gf doesn't know I know about Z, their past relationship, and their plans. She usually tells me that she's going to be hanging out with a friend, but I haven't heard a peep. Honestly, I wouldn't care much that they're linking up *IF* I had been told about their history. The fact that she's constantly *insistent* she's never had a GF before but clearly has irks me. Even if it was extremely casual in her eyes, I'd still want to know.  
She's told me before one of her greatest fears was that she'd never find someone she really wanted to be with, and instead have to settle for something one-sided (which is obviously about Z). She's had ample opportunities to say something, especially the time Z came by with the Kratom.  
It just seems like something she's trying to hide cause she knows I won't like it.

So I’m from a 22M the US studying abroad and there’s a girl in my psychology classes that happens to be from the exact part of the US I’m from (she’s a full time resident in this country). So obviously after the first day of icebreaker stuff we immediately start talking about our shared common background and really hit it off. She’s genuinely one of the most charming girls I’ve ever met.

So week 1 was cool and by the end of week 2 (only meet once a week but they’re 4 hr classes) I had developed a bit of a crush on her  and just really wanted to ask her out and keep getting to know her. I didn’t really get a chance to bring it up week 2 so I figured hey why force it? It’s going well and week 3 felt pretty appropriate to ask a girl out in your class to me anyways. So asking her to coffee and getting her number was the goal for week 3, and honestly I was really excited and not nervous at all. We have great rapport, I think there’s mutual interest here, and I just had a really good feeling about it.

Well week 3 finally rolls around, and my excitement turns to disappointment as I realize she’s not going to be here today. Now honestly that’s no biggie, it kills the momentum a bit but hey I’ll just try next week instead. Well today was week 4’s class and there I was this morning lookin sharp ready to bring my A game, before realizing once again that she’s not showing up this week either as class starts

Now there’s like a million possibilities on why she’s not in class so I don’t think speculating would do me any good. She’s her own person with her own life and certainty doesn’t owe me her attention,but I won’t lie to you I’m really bummed. I guess I’ve got particular tastes with who I start crushing on because it doesn’t happen often, I don’t fool with dating apps and like many others my age generally don’t put myself out there enough so when I meet a cute intelligent British-American girl from the same state as me who’s exactly my type I got excited man. And today it feels like I’ve been cosmically cock blocked from a golden opportunity here.

I guess it’s technically still possible but I’m starting to get the sneaking suspicion all of this is a pipe dream and I was a fool to think it wasn’t too good to be true. I’m also really starting to regret not asking her out week 2. ",2,1728925082.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False
1g3koz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1g3koz6/the_real_trap_of_revealing_clothes_why_semen/,The Real Trap of Revealing Clothes: Why Semen Retention is Our Only Real Power,"
Brothers, let’s get real here. The game we’re living in is rigged, and you know it. The world is stacked against us, and one of the biggest traps out there is right in front of our eyes—women’s revealing clothes. I’m talking about tight dresses, low-cut tops, skirts that barely cover anything—it's everywhere, and it’s messing with our heads. The way society is set up, our biology is being exploited daily, and it’s time we called it out for what it is.

While we’re out here fighting to stay focused on our SR streak, these women are walking around in revealing clothes with full confidence, completely untouched by the visual triggers that tear men down. They aren’t dealing with the same battle. Women can wear these clothes without losing an ounce of energy, while men are left struggling to control their urges. And for us, every slip—every time we give in to the urge to release—it drains us, weakens us, and strips away our confidence. They live on easy mode, and we’re constantly battling the system just to keep our heads above water.

Look around. You’ve seen it everywhere :

* **At the gym:** You’re there to work out, stay focused, and make gains, but then a woman walks in wearing tight leggings or a revealing sports bra, showing off every curve. She’s just doing her workout, thinking about her day or maybe a Netflix show, completely unaware that there are guys like us fighting to keep their eyes off her. She’s not losing anything—no energy, no confidence—while you’re trying to block out the urges and stay on track. The system is rigged.
* **On social media:** She posts a picture wearing barely anything, and men flood the comments, simping and giving her all the validation in the world. But for her? It’s just another post. She’s not losing anything. Meanwhile, guys are stuck scrolling, getting triggered, maybe even releasing, and after that quick release, they’re left feeling drained and guilty. She gets her confidence boost; men lose their edge.
* **In public:** Women can walk around in revealing clothes and still be completely disconnected from the sexual energy they’re projecting. They could be chatting about coffee or some random, innocent topic, while men are battling the visual triggers. She’s not probably not even thinking about sex (surely not to the same degree as men); she’s living her life. But for guys, it’s a different story—those visuals are constantly hitting, making it harder to stay disciplined. She’s confident and carefree, and we’re fighting just to keep it together.

And here’s the messed-up part: women aren’t losing anything from this. They’re not drained by their biology like men are. They can walk around showing off their bodies, and it doesn’t affect their energy or confidence one bit. But men? Every time we release, we’re losing that energy. Our confidence takes a hit. It’s like a biological trap designed to keep men weak, chasing, and distracted.

They can have sex, and still walk away with their glow and confidence fully intact. But for us, every time we have sex and ejaculate, we’re losing a piece of our power. It’s the biggest trap out there, and society never talks about it. This game is rigged, and our biology is being used against us. Yeah sure some of you might say , you could just have sex without ejaculating , but that alone is extremely hard to achieve and requires a lot of control and discipline while for women its just effortless to walk away after sex without being drained.

So, what’s the solution? **Semen retention is our only real power.**

When you hold onto your energy, you’re taking back control from this rigged system. Every time you resist the urge, every time you choose not to give in to the visuals around you, you’re keeping what’s yours. You’re building real discipline, real focus, and unshakable confidence—the kind that doesn’t come from simping or chasing validation. You’re refusing to play by the rules set to weaken you.

Women might have the advantage of not being affected by the same triggers, but we’ve got the power of awareness. We see through the illusion. We know that semen retention is how we rise above the traps that are laid out for us. It’s how we stay strong in a world designed to make men weak.

Stay strong, brothers. The game is rigged, but we’re not playing by their rules anymore. **Semen retention is the way we reclaim our power as men.** 

**TL;DR:** Women’s revealing clothes are a trap, designed to exploit men’s visual nature.

1g3kost,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTransGirls/comments/1g3kost/early_menopause_or_hysterectomy/,Early Menopause or Hysterectomy,"I have terrible dysphoria, especially when I’m not in makeup, and especially since my area has stopped supplying hormones specifically to trans women. That’s the preface. I spent time with my best friend, she had to work, so we went to her place of business for a few hours. That’s the setup. I drink entirely too much coffee. That’s the anecdote.

I was freezing, but my outfit was adorable, so I wasn’t going to mess it up with a jacket. I wasn’t wearing makeup because I didn’t expect us to be going out. So I went to the coffee shop in my friend’s place of business. I jokingly asked the barista to just shoot me with some steam to warm up. We both chuckled, then I ordered my usual hot coffee beverage, then made the comment that I’ll just be using the cup to stay warm until my next hot flash.

The most affirming statement then came from this person who I genuinely would have expected (based solely on the business and the area we’re in) to be problematic.

“Did they induce early menopause, or did you have a hysterectomy,” she asked with a smile. I didn’t give a direct answer. I just responded with, “My surgery this year. I’m just getting over it, but the hot flashes are terrible.” I didn’t specifically say what surgery, but I let her take the implication wherever she was comfortable sitting with it.

She let me know she had a hysterectomy at 27. Two other women in queue joined the conversation with their experiences, and we were all having a decent time over coffee talk. I felt so amazing being able to go through this entire conversation with no one mentioning anything other than what we were discussing; nothing about gender, nothing about politics or religion, nothing about transness or “woke culture” or whatever. Just casual conversation with total strangers in a very conservative business in an extremely conservative area without experiencing hate while wearing no makeup and having not been on hormones for over two months.

I found a place to discreetly post medications to my home, and have restarted my much needed hormones. I’m down to about 2 or 3 hot flashes a day in only one week, and my depression is getting better. The darker side of post-op, I suppose, is how dependent we are on our medications. I don’t have a lot of happy moments in my life. I thought it would be nice to share this small happy moment.",10,1728925054.0,StraightTransGirls,3,0.86,False

Okay so, I can say I'm pretty diffixult person when it comes ti terms of feelings. It's hard for me to catch them and even when I do it's never too deep. But the biggest problem is the fact that I never admit them to myself and that's what makes my life confusing.

My family never really ""banned"" me from anything except that I have a curfew (whixh is 10 pm and isn't too bad tbh and I get it) but lately they've all been acting like I'm some kind of liar and that I have secret meetings with my ""boyfriend"" (which I've never had) whenever I go out with friends ( I literarly have 2-3 friends lol)

And my sister lately came up with the theory that I'm in a secret relationship with this random guy from my class, let's call him M, which I never shown any interest in and the other way around, and haven't even spoke to him more than once I guess? And I couldn't care less about him and she keeps talking about our relationship to our parents, who subcounciously started believing her.

Ok, and I was like why everybody thinks that I have better love life than I do?😅 

I was really in love only as a child, later ot were just flings and I could never bring ymself to tell my friend about them (because mostly they were flings, she's not too trustworthy and she's basically in love with everything male walking around, and I don't want to break girls code but like... can I have anyone in this damn universe? And i don't admit such things to myself mostly) Lol, but it's fine since I never cared enough much, and neither did she about em, but still..

🤠A few days ago, she came up to me and said that she has important news that have something to do only with me, that it's serious, tooo shoxking, and actually great but she doesn't know how wpuld I react?
And I immediately  figured out it's probbably something about my love life, maybe somebody admiting their fewlings for me through a friend (what otger logic explanation?)

And I was right, we couldn't meet that day and I was overthinking all the time in anticipation. And somehow I realised I was subcounciously hoping it was this one guy (let's call him M2-same name as one before lol) we usually talk to during our lunch breaks, for whom I ha e mixed. Feelings about I can't figure out. Am I into him? Wouldn't really say so, but I feel some kind of connection exists maybe, our energies are on the same level somehow, we have so much in common and basically he's not too perfect but he meets my standards (smart, funny, art soul). I realised we're good for each other, but when we're together I don't have any ""feeling"" you lnow. Maybe he's just a close friend. I never usually see him otherwise when it's not lunch, for about 5 mins every day, once I gathered courage when I saw him and one other friend of mine  ending school at the same time (rarely happens since we go to doffferent high schools) and got an idea for me and best friend to ask them if the ywpuld join us for a coffee (we headed ro cafe anyways)
And they politely refused, more precisely M2's friend, they said they were exhausted and I believe so, since one of them just had PE and it was moring school so everybody's tired. And I lost all my hope and felt kind of awkward after that, it's not important but I rarely give people amy chances and he lost that one if he really felt something, so taht's it.

I realised that that day I kind of wished he was the one talking to my bestie, since noone else seemed logic. And Then I was schocked when I found out the real answer the other day!

No it was not M2, It was a guy L from my class who is a friend of M (if you understand anything here, sorry😅) Anyways I couldn't believe it since That guy barely ever spoke to me, md the other way around (and no I'm not some popular girl people are affraid to talk to lol) we just never even had a proper conversation after a year of going to class together.  Like how did you even start liking me? I mean I'm not too much diffferent in school.and house but still, how did you get to know me? Or did you just figure out I was ""good match"" and decided it could work out.


Anyways I was kind of schocked in a bad way, since I always thought of him as weird and confused (trust me I'm both but not on that level), but he's not a bad person, I guess, physically he's strong and big and. Taht's good but somehow I just ugh, he's not my type of person from what I've known about him. But still, I don't really know him well and it would be very unfair from.me to dump him and don't even give him a chance to talk to me or get to know me (and then decidewhat to do). HE told my friend that he likes me and that she shouldn't tell me (maybe she really shouldn't have) and that he wants her to be his wiimngwoman or something and wants her to find out about what I think of him/feel idk. And I told her tk write that we didn't know each other and that I didn't talk about him much when she mentioned him since me and L aren't really close (which really is true)
But I really appreciate that he confessed his feelings and decided that he's the one who should take a first step and all that (which is standard but many men aren't ready to do that these days) and he said something like ""I choose her the most"" and ""I want to win her over"", she tolf himt o take it slow and he said something like ""10 km/h"". That's kin dof cute somehow I guess.

And I've spent whole last day thinking about it, and today when I showd up at schoool he didn't even dare to talk to me (again) and I didn't make effort either, It's not me who have such feelings. I just comtinued to live life as before. We did some ""project"" (I can't say together because he just stood there and tried to help a bit, and art is my area so), but at school I just realised, ugh damn, I don't know what kind of getting to know each other would make me fall for him. He's not a bad guy, I just don't think he's the right for me, and taht he's actually able to win the prize he wants (he's always like that, even woth studying, says he's read, that he knows everything, and then takes a test and get pretty bad grades)

Given to the fact that I'm somehow emotionally weird and hardly fall in love, have straight eyes, my standards, but social anxiety and don't know too many people from opposite sex (as close friends) and what the worst thing is we go to the same class- us being together is humiliating enough, imagine our break-up. And tbh it's not about what other people will say/think, but about the fact that if I think that t such relationship of mine would be cringe, if so do I really need it?

I'm sorry. For boghering everyone amd making you read my whole life haha, but I just had to collect my thoughts, and even ask for some advice since even my friend (who is his new ally) is on his side only because of that.. and since there is noone I can confide in.. 
If you have some advice or view on the situation, I'd appreciate it even though it's all my decision after all.
I think I'm not gonna do anything, if the God's will reall is for me and L to be together, then I'll probbably develop feelings in the future or smth,...
But. The fact that I know about it just makes things weird, even though I do not really notice him in class, I still can't help but think about it all when I see him. I don't wanna hurt him, but I doubt his feelings are strong enough, letting him develop them and then leaving him may hurt even more, but being unfair and not giving him a chance?

And what about me? Lowering my standards? Letting myself be something to win? Hell no, or am I looking at the situation weirdly?",1,1728925008.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False

Looks a good starting point, what do you reckon?

Brewing Ethiopian anaerobic light roast coffee with a Hario V60 requires precision to bring out its fruity, floral, and wine-like flavours. Here's your step-by-step guide, including the Fellow Ode 2 grinder setting:

Equipment Needed:

Hario V60 dripper and paper filter

Freshly roasted Ethiopian anaerobic light roast coffee beans

Fellow Ode 2 grinder (set to grind size 4-5 for V60)

Gooseneck kettle

Scales

Timer

Cup or server


Step-by-Step Brewing Guide:

1. Boil the Water

Water temperature: Aim for 92–94°C (just off the boil, or wait 1-2 minutes after boiling).

Amount of water: Use 300ml of filtered water for a 1:16 coffee-to-water ratio (for 18g of coffee).


2. Weigh and Grind the Coffee

Coffee dose: Measure out 18g of coffee beans.

Grind setting on Fellow Ode 2: Set to 4–5. This gives you a medium-fine grind, perfect for light roasts in a V60. It will allow good extraction of the delicate flavours in the Ethiopian anaerobic coffee.


3. Prepare the V60

Place the V60 dripper on top of your cup or server and insert a paper filter.

Rinse the filter with hot water to remove the paper taste and preheat the V60 and the server/cup. Discard the rinse water.


4. Add the Ground Coffee

Place the freshly ground coffee in the centre of the V60 and lightly shake to level the bed.


5. Start the Brewing Process

Bloom: Pour 40g of water (twice the coffee weight) to saturate the grounds. Use a slow, circular motion starting from the centre and moving outward.

Bloom time: Let it bloom for 30–45 seconds to release trapped gases and improve flavour extraction.


6. Main Pour

After the bloom, pour water in 3 stages, aiming for 300ml total. Pour in a slow, circular motion:

Pour 1: Add water until the total reaches 150ml (about 110g more than the bloom). Pour slowly over 30 seconds.

Pour 2: Continue pouring until the total reaches 220ml (another 70g), over the next 20–30 seconds.

Pour 3: Finally, pour until you reach the final 300ml (another 80g) in the next 20–30 seconds.



7. Allow to Drain

Let the water fully drain through the coffee bed. The total brew time should be around 3-3.5 minutes. If it’s slower or faster, adjust the grind size on the Fellow Ode 2 accordingly.


8. Serve and Enjoy

Swirl the coffee in your server or cup to mix the different layers of extraction.

Taste and appreciate the coffee’s vibrant acidity, fruity complexity, and clean finish typical of an Ethiopian anaerobic light roast.


Additional Tips:

Adjusting for taste: If the coffee tastes too sour or weak, try a finer grind or slightly hotter water. If it's too bitter or over-extracted, use a coarser grind or slightly lower the water temperature.

Water quality: Use filtered water to avoid any off-flavours from tap water.


With this guide, you'll be able to extract the bright, complex flavours from your Ethiopian anaerobic coffee, bringing out its best characteristics.

Since we live somewhere isolated I'm always the one driving us everywhere.  
And today I was just so exhausted, I can't stand anymore these type of ""days together"". I already told her a couple of times that I can't stand her drinking, that I get super anxious and that we could maybe spend other time together and she can drink when I'm not home if she really needs it. Her response: ""I'll no longer be able to drink a beer on a terrace outside.."" and all victimhood and how I was calling her alcoholic etc... She does have a dependence of alcohol, since she needs once a week to be all day drinking and can't stop. Even if it's just one day, that doesn't mean you haven't got a problem with it...

I'd love to go somewhere with her without having to worry if she will drink, how the day is gonna end, how is she gonna wake up the day after... I'm just so tired...  
I've recently started setting boundaries, and it's really hard to stick to them. I don't know how to handle this, should I just stop going out with her if I know that she will be drinking? Should I suggest making other plans and if she starts drinking stop the plan? How is she going to react? Will I be able to endure it?",1,1728924877.0,raisedbyborderlines,0,1.0,False

We hugged goodbye, and he said we should do it again. We texted during the week, and he seemed sweet.

On Date 2, he came to my city. He was the one initiating most of the physical contact—holding my hand, putting his arm around my waist, and later kissing me. I liked it but was shy and didn’t show it as much. He was really complimentary, smelling me and saying how good I smelled, playing with my hair, and saying I looked great in red. He suggested going to a nightclub, but I hesitated since I’d never been to one. Every time he kissed me, he tried using his tongue, but I was too nervous to let it happen. The date ended with him kissing me again, and he texted to make sure I got home safely and said he had a really nice time.

Then, his texts started slowing down. When I asked if he was okay, he said he wasn’t feeling well but still wanted to meet.

He was the one who suggested taking photobooth pictures together and said, “It’s about time for a picture.” In the booth, he tried to French kiss me again, but I was still too nervous. Afterward, he kissed me goodbye and suggested we try a restaurant next time.

He said “ I had a good time - I wish you the best also” I deleted his contact and unmatched him on Bumble.

Now, I’m confused—what went wrong? He seemed into me, but then pulled away. I really liked him and wish I’d been more open during our dates.

Our current lease ends September 30th, 2025, but we may extend it if necessary.

We are also requiring a $675 security deposit to be paid upon move-in along with first month’s rent.

Monthly Expenses:
Rent Portion: $675/month
Internet Portion: $18.75/month
Electric Bill Portion: usually around $20-$50/month, depends on usage.
Gas Bill Portion: usually around $5-$10/month, depends on usage.

Apartment Features:
- 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom.
- Bathroom has adequate plumbing and a nicely-sized bathtub & shower.
- Living room is a decently-sized space with a couch, coffee table, bean bag chair, TV, & a bookshelf.
- Kitchen is also decently-sized and includes a fridge, stove, toaster oven, microwave, sink, and bar table with bar chairs. 
    - One caveat: We do not have any kind of vent above the stove, which we have constantly complained to our super about to no avail. As a result, we have had to cook with the smoke detector off to prevent it from being set off by whatever we are cooking. This has not really been a problem for us at all, but we want to be transparent here.

Sublet Room Features:
12’ by 7’ (84 sq. ft.)
1 Window facing the street.
Closet space
For an additional $100, we’ll throw in a desk.

Who we’re looking for:
Ultimately, we want someone who is Clean, Considerate, and Chill (3 C’s).
- Clean meaning someone who helps us maintain a clean apartment by cleaning the kitchen and dishes after using them, keeping the living room and bathroom clean, and is a relatively clean person themselves so we can avoid pests entirely in the apartment.
- Considerate meaning someone who understands that they live with 3 other people whom all share the space. Someone with empathy.
- Chill meaning someone who is friendly and someone that we don’t need to feel awkward around. Mainly, we would like our prospective roommate to be someone we can vibe with and someone who isn’t judgmental. Someone who is ultimately a good fit for us and that we are a good fit for as well.

Who we are:
We are three queer individuals in their early-to-mid 20’s. We are politically left-leaning and are pro-Palestine. Two of us are male and in a relationship. One of us is non-binary and neurodivergent. Two of us are Latin American (Mexican & Mexican/Colombian) and one of us is Italian. If any of these attributes are dealbreakers for you, please do not apply to be our sublet. We would strongly prefer our sublet to be queer or at least queer-friendly/an ally, left-leaning, pro-Palestine, pro-Trans, and understanding/accepting of neurodivergence.

What we need from you:
- We want to know what you do for work. We don’t need any proof of income (we’re not landlords lol) and we have no judgment no matter what line of work you are in, but we would like to ensure that we are subleasing with someone who has a steady source of income and can make rent payments on time.
- We want to know a little about yourself. Whatever you feel comfortable telling us and whatever you feel we should know before considering you as a roommate. We really value transparency. We would at the very least like you to tell us your name, age, and gender identity/pronouns in your message.
- We would like to set up a date to get to know you better through a very casual interview. As much as we’d be interviewing you, you’d be interviewing us because, at the end of day, we are all determining whether or not we are a good fit for each other. We would also like to show you the apartment and your potential room so you can make sure it’s right for you.

The game we’re living in is rigged, and you know it. The world is stacked against us, and one of the biggest traps out there is right in front of our eyes—women’s revealing clothes. I’m talking about tight dresses, low-cut tops, skirts that barely cover anything—it's everywhere, and it’s messing with our heads. The way society is set up, our biology is being exploited daily, and it’s time we called it out for what it is.

While we’re out here fighting to stay focused on our SR streak, these women are walking around in revealing clothes with full confidence, completely untouched by the visual triggers that tear men down. They aren’t dealing with the same battle. Women can wear these clothes without losing an ounce of energy, while men are left struggling to control their urges. And for us, every slip—every time we give in to the urge to release—it drains us, weakens us, and strips away our confidence. They live on easy mode, and we’re constantly battling the system just to keep our heads above water.

Look around. You’ve seen it everywhere :

* **At the gym:** You’re there to work out, stay focused, and make gains, but then a woman walks in wearing tight leggings or a revealing sports bra, showing off every curve. She’s just doing her workout, thinking about her day or maybe a Netflix show, completely unaware that there are guys like us fighting to keep their eyes off her. She’s not losing anything—no energy, no confidence—while you’re trying to block out the urges and stay on track. The system is rigged.
* **On social media:** She posts a picture wearing barely anything, and men flood the comments, simping and giving her all the validation in the world. But for her? It’s just another post. She’s not losing anything. Meanwhile, guys are stuck scrolling, getting triggered, maybe even releasing, and after that quick release, they’re left feeling drained and guilty. She gets her confidence boost; men lose their edge.
* **In public:** Women can walk around in revealing clothes and still be completely disconnected from the sexual energy they’re projecting. They could be chatting about coffee or some random, innocent topic, while men are battling the visual triggers. She’s not probably not even thinking about sex (surely not to the same degree as men); she’s living her life. But for guys, it’s a different story—those visuals are constantly hitting, making it harder to stay disciplined. She’s confident and carefree, and we’re fighting just to keep it together.

And here’s the messed-up part: women aren’t losing anything from this. They’re not drained by their biology like men are. They can walk around showing off their bodies, and it doesn’t affect their energy or confidence one bit. But men? Every time we release, we’re losing that energy. Our confidence takes a hit. It’s like a biological trap designed to keep men weak, chasing, and distracted.

They can have sex, and still walk away with their glow and confidence fully intact. But for us, every time we have sex and ejaculate, we’re losing a piece of our power. It’s the biggest trap out there, and society never talks about it. This game is rigged, and our biology is being used against us. Yeah sure some of you might say , you could just have sex without ejaculating , but that alone is extremely hard to achieve and requires a lot of control and discipline while for women its just effortless to walk away after sex without being drained.

So, what’s the solution? **Semen retention is our only real power.**

When you hold onto your energy, you’re taking back control from this rigged system. Every time you resist the urge, every time you choose not to give in to the visuals around you, you’re keeping what’s yours. You’re building real discipline, real focus, and unshakable confidence—the kind that doesn’t come from simping or chasing validation. You’re refusing to play by the rules set to weaken you.

Women might have the advantage of not being affected by the same triggers, but we’ve got the power of awareness. We see through the illusion. We know that semen retention is how we rise above the traps that are laid out for us. It’s how we stay strong in a world designed to make men weak.

Stay strong, brothers. The game is rigged, but we’re not playing by their rules anymore. **Semen retention is the way we reclaim our power as men.** 

**TL;DR:** Women’s revealing clothes are a trap, designed to exploit men’s visual nature. While women aren’t losing anything, men are drained every time they release, losing energy, confidence, and focus. Semen retention is the only way to break free from this rigged system and build real power and discipline.",16,1728924665.0,Semenretention,14,0.9,False

Wife wants sex no more than twice per year, could do without just fine. I'm 49, zero self-esteem, realizing nobody young and hot will ever want to fuck me ever again. Best I can do is cheat one day with someone equally desperate. But I'm not looking to cheat. I'm starting to accept my position and live out the remainder of my days masturbating. 

Low and behold a co-worker in another store within my company hit it off during a meeting. I mean like an effortless, supernatural weird connection. We both felt it. A few weeks later she texts me for work advice, and we slowly start talking. I never even thought I would feel that kind of connection just talking. 

  
We went out for coffee once. Another long story short, I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth about me, even though I just don't have the strength to do this...sneak around, lie to her. Not speaking to my wife is the easy part, but the rest? I told her everything about me except that. I just don't have the energy. I'm worn down. This woman is 33, VERY attractive, strong, did I mention out of my league? She's everything I could have asked for back in the day, back before I made the biggest mistake of my life. I know this is probably my last chance to experience a young, vibrant, sexual relationship. 

  
And here I am, ignoring her requests for another date, delaying it, even as she tries to playfully tempt me with sexy texts. What am I doing? I really am finished. I really am. And this woman would not be interested if she knew I was married. But I wanted the attention so badly. And I really, really do like her, just being near her. I don't want to hurt anyone and destroy what little I have left that has been built. Financially, the stability I have would be gone in an instant if I left. I can't risk it, and within 5 years or so, realistically, this 33-year-old beauty would probably tire of me, anyway, realizing our age gap really does bother her. I'm just tired. I can't even cheat right. ",5,1728924621.0,deadbedroom,4,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

This was originally a Fukuro I got here on the market, it has no external flaws to be found. Hoping to pass this along to another Hooman as I am starting to clean up my collection.

I mill-maxed the PCB but left the spacebar switch soldered due to how the Fukuro plate works. (It doesn't hold the switch in the plate directly), I also have another solder pcb which has damaged pads on the tab, caps lock, and left shift, which will probably need to get repaired somewhere.

Here is what is included:

* A mill-maxed PCB, and one damaged soldered PCB, currently built with BSUN Ragdolls & Cherry Clip-ins.
* 4 plates, standard Alu and PC, and custom cut PP and POM.
* Original Carrying Case.
* Keycaps not included, but PM me if interested.

We matched on Hinge early September and have hung out consistently at least once a week since then. Turns out his roommate and my roommate are actually good friends and that our friend groups are fairly intertwined (hilarious, because I never knew him before we matched) so we've also just run into each other a few times.

But there hasn't been really any physical contact except for when I saw him at a party and he asked for a hug. This was just over a week ago, and we have hung out twice since then, both times til late in the night. No handholding, no hugging, and definitely not any kissing.

Disclaimer: I am very shy when it comes to intimacy, both because of my own lack of experience (I have dated other people before and been in a relationship, though) and also because I have a slight fear of intimacy due to bad experiences in the past. That doesn't mean I don't like/want intimacy though. I just prefer to take things slower than most. So honestly until now, it hasn't been a big deal to me because I liked that I could hang out with him and not feel any pressure.

But I've really started to like him at this point, and I do want to do those things. Even if it's just something like holding hands. I've talked with my friends, who know him, and they all agree he likes me, but that he is just nervous and awkward as a person. Honestly, him and I seem to be pretty similar in our ""courting"" approach (lol), which for me has always been more through acts of service, making plans consistently, etc (for example, i bought him his coffee on a few dates, he's also brought candy i like or snacks on others, he's read a book that I told him I really love, and I watched one of his favorite movies). So the fact that we are so similar is feeling like a blessing and a curse.

I am not one to focus a lot on gender roles but I know it's a big factor here. I have always been really shy and I've never made the first move during early dating stages. Most of the people I have dated are men who usually do it for me. I really want to try and initiate something but I have no idea how to and the thought of it makes me so nervous that I think I end up pulling away. I really dont want this to fizzle out and cement us into only being friends. It's starting to make me wonder if he does just see me as a friend which makes me even more nervous to do something. I keep telling myself that I'll try to go in for a hug or something but I always chicken out. I literally feel like I am in middle school again lol.

I know this is long -- but does anyone have any advice on how to approach this? What's a good way of making a move on someone, if I even should?

All of my friends and family members said I was unhappy in the relationship fwiw. Finally, my mother is a narcissist so I feel like this may be just perpetuating a cycle.

Some relationship background (sorry this is a lot): 

* Felt like I was walking on eggshells and was always scared to upset her by saying or doing the wrong thing (she said she felt like she was walking on eggshells around me too). Felt myself changing my behaviors in order to please her. 
* Had unending long relationship talks that would go in circles and were emotionally/mentally taxing for me. But they ended with ""feeling closer"" according to her, which made it extremely confusing. 
* She had trouble regulating her emotions and would cry almost every time we had a conversation that was deeper than surface level or involved conflict. 
* We had passionate fights/makeup sessions where she would tell me she never felt closer to me after resolving conflict. 
* Criticized my spending time with my two sisters (who are two of my best friends) and said when we were hanging out with one of them, she felt like ""my secondary partner"" and that my sister was ""my primary partner."" Once accused me of lying to meet up with my sister for coffee. 
* I signed up for an acting class where a comedy scene called for my ""kissing"" my scene partner, which turned into a massive fight where she said ""now she had to be worried about her bf making out with people."" When I acted the scene out in class, of course we didn't actually kiss. 
* Partner reacted extremely negatively to any change of plans. Was once 45 min late picking her up to go to a jazz show without texting bc I lost track of time and she completely blew up. ""Feeling like my partner is unreliable is unacceptable."" Once ate dinner with a friend who had just arrived from Brazil and was hungry without telling her and when she arrived, I asked her to order something and that we would def stay, etc. She refused, then blew up at me later in the night bc I ate earlier than her and forgot to tell her.
* I said there was a possibility I may go to a strip club during a bachelor party, which resulted in multiple blowups/fights, and she equated it to cheating. 
* Said she had previous trauma from a relationship about an ex withholding information from her so it was a huge issue if any information came out that I previously didn't tell her during similar conversations. 
* I shared my location with her indefinitely early on in the relationship because I said ""I had nothing to hide"" and she never shared hers back. When I realized this was odd later on, I stopped sharing mine. She confronted me and I explained that the inequity was the issue for me, that if she shared hers then I would continue sharing mine. She accused me of ""hiding things,"" but then never shared her location. 
* Had difficulty accepting/processing any women I had either dated or hooked up with. I went to a baseball game with my friend of 20+ years (we have hooked up maybe 3-5x total but haven't in 10 years and I consider her a completely platonic friend) and had to drive to my gf's house afterward to calm her down because she was so upset. 
* Accused me of ""hiding her"" from my ex very early on in the relationship when I said I would be uncomfortable going out with her a block from my old apt because I hadn't told my ex yet and didn't want to run into her before telling her about us. Later on, we were out one night, she found out her ex was at a bar we were about to go into and she made us leave. Same behavior she criticized me for. 
* Questioned my taste in friends because she disapproved sometimes of things they said. 

It's pretty clear my therapist thinks she either has BPD or BPD traits, did not think we had a healthy dynamic and said I morphed into a caretaker/people pleaser role at the expense of my own needs. Lot of talk about codependency, enmeshment, etc. Didn't tell me to separate from her but had me read a book called ""Stop Caretaking the Borderline or Narcissist: How to End the Drama and Get On with Life,"" which actually resonated. I took the quiz at the end of the book and it said I was in a relationship with someone with BPD. 

There's more but that's all I can think of right now. Am I crazy or was she exhibiting BPD behavior? Why do I feel the urge to go back if it was so bad? What if my therapist is wrong about her?

So to preface I have been single for 10 years and never had much desire to get back into dating or meeting people after my last relationship turned into a nightmare. Now where this all begins, I was 26 and had just started a new job and I met her one day as I was taking a break. Nothing much interesting happened there aside from casual chat, now rinse and repeat that a few times. We traded numbers and started forming a friendship, give or take a couple more weeks we eventually got coffee and started feeling a connection. Fast forward about 2 and a half years we had come to a point where feelings were very much involved and mutual. We had many conversations over the years and we both aligned on a large majority of things baring a few differences in hobbies and spiritual views, we were comfortable and open with each other (or so I thought). In that period I learned she had never been in a relationship or had a date before. (I was the first guy to ever get coffee with her) At this point it was clear I was her first dip in the pool of dating. I had expressed interest in having something with her. I had explained my past to her and she seemed to understand that I wanted to slow roll into a relationship and see how things went before I pulled the trigger on commitment. Now this is the place where things get confusing and dicey or just plain whacked out. We are catching up to the current events at this point that led to me posting this. She left for a new job and after a few months of working there she picked up a guys number. She communicated that to me and I was alright with it and we maintained a close friendship. I also started talking with someone new a few months later but that thing fizzled out and never went anywhere. Around this time she comes back to working at the same company as me, and things had burned out with the guy she met. So we started to get back into it with each other and it started to pick up some pace since we were seeing each other more often and didn't have to dance around completely different schedules. Now we are up to around the last 11 months. When she returned one of the new guys at work gave her his number, which cool I'm not going to tell someone who they can or cant be friends with. So here is where everything starts unraveling, It is holiday season of 2023 and anyone whose worked a retail job knows how stressful the holidays are. We started to get intimate with each other though we never slept together. I in that moment felt very comfortable and was ready make it official with her. I was waiting until her roommate went out of town to lock things down with her since I had wanted to basically take over her kitchen and cook dinner and have a bottle of wine with her and make it a fancy surprise. Then she decided to kick me out of her life for 2 months before that happened.  Stating she was stressed and overwhelmed with everything but never specified what ""everything"" was. That hurt me quite a bit and really put me off emotionally. I should've left it there but part of me figured ok she's new to this stage in life or maybe the holidays are really getting to her so I didn't press. She eventually comes back around to me and things slowly spiral then go abso-fucking-lutely off the rails. I still cared very much about her but she started flip flopping on me one moment something is ok the next moment its not. She at one point out of the blue went on about how great and important I was and how much she loved me. Which was entirely unexpected and was quite confusing to hear at that point in time. Our whole dynamic had shifted I kept trying to get a day figured out where we could see each other and sit down and talk, but she put zero effort into it I would tell her my days off and then she would never follow through. Yet then she would go on about missing me? So now we get to the last few weeks of this and I am honestly hurt and depressed I don't understand at all what even happened here or even the how or why of it all. In these last few weeks her presence in my life never changed we were civil no arguments no anything. Well remember the guy who gave her his number when she came back to work? I found out she went on ""one"" date with him and she decided to drop me like trash. All those years and time invested in each other all the kind words and small moments. Just out of no where up in smoke. Left with parting words of ""I'm with him now, have a good life""",1,1728923723.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

By increasing your Google reviews rating and ranking you are going to flooded with new customers daily, but here is a catch.



Customers naturally don't want to review the places and you can't force them to make reviews.



And if you buy fake reviews to boost your Google ranking, google will review it and blacklists your coffee shop from Google.



So, What can you do to increase your Google ranking naturally with your real customers that drink coffee at your coffee shop.



Here's come the solution ""People will tend to do things, when you offer some freebies or discount them but giving them discount will become unethical to them and also effect your profitability, so what is the ethical and easy way to naturally boost your Google ranking and Increase your Sales""

Stimulant laxatives do work very well, but are very... messy... Last time I used one, I hadn't pooped in 8 days so my mom went to the pharmacy and picked up those tiny orange pills. I took one and waited for the magic to happen. It began with HORRIBLE stomach cramps like some of the worst I'd ever had. (probably because my bowels were being stimulated to move and stuff.) Then, I felt a need to fart. It didn't feet like a big one it just felt like a silent passing of gas. I let it rip and yeah as you can expect I sharted. I then spent two hours running back and forth from the toilet, to my bedroom, and back to the toilet, with liquid diarrhea. 

Yes, Ik laxatives are meant to give you diarrhea, but that one was to much for me. After that I tried Miralax, not enough, I tried coffee, worked fine, but then I found the miracle cure.

We recently moved to a new area, and now I no longer have the option to just pop into the office to get out of the house.

My wife works part-time and not from home. I work full-time, often needing to take spontaneous calls and attend meetings as I'm a team lead. My setup at home is great, multiple monitors, an adjustable desk, and everything I need to be productive. But my wife has been asking me to leave the house at least once a week for the entire day to give her the space she needs. 

I found a nearby coworking space that isn't too expensive, and I suggested that I could work from there every other week, and maybe from a coffee shop on alternate weeks. It's not ideal for me, though, I’m worried about staying productive while moving around and the challenges of keeping my work secure in public spaces.

I want to support her need for alone time, but I’m really struggling with the idea of having to leave my home office, especially when I need to be available to my team. It’s also a bit hurtful that when I express my concerns, she seems defensive and not very supportive of my situation.

Things seemed to be good until a few months ago, when she started to be very critical and picking up on my (admittedly many) faults.

About 2 months ago she ended the relationship, which took me by surprise. It was further complicated by us being tied into a long tenancy that is very difficult to get out of, so we are stuck living together.

I’ve found it pretty difficult so far. She has also continued to be very affectionate and we have slept together a few times since we broke up, which has been nice but I have struggled with, if that makes sense.

The other weekend was particularly difficult as she was away with her friends on holiday and I was feeling especially lonely and it really hit home that the relationship ended. When she returned I couldn’t stop crying when I saw her, which was quite embarrassing, but it is what it is.

She was supportive, and we had a chat. But she also mentioned that she hadn’t moved on from me and we should have another talk in the next few days.

The next talk was quite hard. She filled me in on a few additional details. Prior to the break up, she had begin talking to her ex, and they had been for coffee once or twice. I knew about this, and whilst it didn’t feel great, she said it was just catching up with an old friend and I trusted her as I believed she loved me.

Turns out she then slept with the ex soon after she broke up with me, as well as continuing to occasionally sleep with me. She also admitted to complaining about me to him whilst we were still together, which is a small point but hurt nonetheless.

She says the thing with her ex is now over, and was based on a complicated history surrounding her diagnosis with bi-polar.

She also says that she hasn’t moved on from me, but still isn’t sure that she wants to restart the relationship. She said part of the problem is that I didn’t put enough effort in to trying to change her mind when she broke up with me. She also mentioned there is someone else she is potentially interested in.

In summary, my head feels like it’s about to explode. I think we have potentially agreed to the tenancy ending on the 9^(th) December, dependent on a few factors, so its at least another couple of months till we can actually get some space from each other.

My head says that I should be walking away from this situation, but my heart wants to win her back, and also perhaps I’m not being understanding enough given her bi polar condition. 

Apologies for the length of the above, I think it was more of a cathartic exercise to try and get the words out rather than anything else. But anyone who managed to stay awake and read the above who has some sage advice they could offer, it would be much appreciated.

Thank you

1g3ju5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipesy/comments/1g3ju5r/does_chai_tea_have_caffeine_heres_what_you_need/,Does Chai Tea Have Caffeine? Here's What You Need to Know 🍵☕️ #easyrecipesy,"https://preview.redd.it/og6jr2lmzqud1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1c5d063a5858072a6aaeb8547d387de5976cd09

Hey tea enthusiasts!

I've been getting a lot of questions about whether **chai tea contains caffeine**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

# What is Chai Tea?

Chai, or masala chai, is a spiced tea beverage originating from India, typically made with black tea and a blend of spices like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black peppercorns.

# Caffeine Content in Chai Tea

Since traditional chai is based on **black tea**, it naturally contains caffeine. Here's how the caffeine content typically breaks down:

* **Black Tea Base:** A standard 8-ounce (240 ml) serving of black tea contains approximately **40-70 mg of caffeine**.
* **Masala Chai:** When spices and milk are added to black tea to make masala chai, the caffeine content remains similar to that of plain black tea, roughly **40-70 mg per 8 ounces**.

# Factors Affecting Caffeine Levels

Several factors can influence the caffeine content in your chai tea:

1. **Tea Leaves Used:**
   * **Type of Black Tea:** Different black tea varieties have varying caffeine levels. For example, Assam and Darjeeling teas generally have higher caffeine content compared to others like Earl Grey.
   * **Loose Leaf vs. Tea Bags:** Loose leaf teas often provide a more robust flavor and may contain slightly more caffeine than their tea bag counterparts due to less compacting of the leaves.
2. **Brewing Time and Temperature:**
   * **Longer Steeping:** Steeping the tea leaves for a longer duration or using hotter water can extract more caffeine.
   * **Shorter Steeping:** Reducing steeping time or using cooler water will result in a milder, less caffeinated brew.
3. **Serving Size:**
   * **Larger Cups:** Serving chai in larger volumes will naturally increase the total caffeine intake.

# Decaffeinated Chai Options

If you're looking to enjoy chai without the caffeine, there are **decaffeinated chai teas** available. These options are made by using decaffeinated black tea or herbal tea bases that naturally contain little to no caffeine. Additionally, you can create your own caffeine-free chai by using herbal teas like rooibos or chamomile as a base and adding the traditional chai spices.

# Comparing Caffeine in Chai to Other Beverages

To give you a better perspective, here's how chai tea stacks up against other common caffeinated beverages:

* **Espresso (1 shot, \~1 ounce):** **63 mg of caffeine**
* **Black Coffee (8 ounces):** **95 mg of caffeine**
* **Green Tea (8 ounces):** **20-45 mg of caffeine**
* **Matcha (1 serving, \~1 teaspoon):** **35 mg of caffeine**
* **Chai Tea (8 ounces):** **40-70 mg of caffeine**

# Health Benefits of Caffeine in Chai

Moderate caffeine intake can offer several health benefits, including:

* **Increased Alertness:** Helps improve focus and concentration.
* **Enhanced Physical Performance:** Can boost energy levels and endurance.
* **Antioxidant Properties:** Black tea is rich in antioxidants, which help fight free radicals in the body.

# Potential Downsides of Caffeine

While caffeine has its benefits, excessive consumption can lead to:

* **Insomnia or Disrupted Sleep Patterns**
* **Increased Heart Rate and Blood Pressure**
* **Anxiety or Nervousness**
* **Digestive Issues**

# Conclusion

**Chai tea does contain caffeine**, primarily due to its black tea base. However, the caffeine content is generally moderate and can be adjusted based on brewing methods and serving sizes. If you're sensitive to caffeine or prefer to avoid it, opting for decaffeinated chai varieties or herbal bases can provide a satisfying alternative without the stimulating effects of caffeine.

# Quick Tips for Managing Caffeine Intake in Chai

* **Adjust Steeping Time:** Brew your chai for a shorter period to reduce caffeine extraction.
* **Choose Decaf Blends:** Look for decaffeinated masala chai options available in stores or online.
* **Opt for Herbal Bases:** Use rooibos or other herbal teas combined with traditional chai spices for a caffeine-free version.

What comes to mind other than beans and water is how often we pour.

Bloom and then Pour twice is the standard I guess…Some pour in 50ml steps

Since more water makes more weight and with that more flow it should be making a difference.

So with that in mind there are two extremes.
Bloom and Pour once.
Bloom and then fill up so that all coffee is submerged then continuously pour so the water level won’t change until done.

For those of you who are unfamiliar, 2k is a basketball game and they just added this new thing where you can change the years. So my husband was having a blast playing with the lakers with Kobe bryant and lamar odom (who I honestly only know from the Kardashians)

Our son was playing with the bulls with Rose (forget the guys first name but he just retired) and it was a close game. So I brought my husband a cup of coffee, like I always do, and I guess he started winning and my son said that isn't fair because the coffee gave him energy and made his reflexes better

My husband said mommy can make him hot cocoa but he said its not the same because of the caffeine, and argued hes too young for coffee so it gave dad an unfair advantage.

I dont know much about sports, but I do know Korvor was on that team (I remember reading about how they traded him for a printer) and he was a good 3 point shooter, and all our son was doing was dunking with rose and getting blocked, so I whispered ""the guy you have in the back isn't doing anything, so switch him out for korver, so when you try to dunk with rose you can pass out to him for a 3 point""

And he did and caught up, and my husband said thats not fair because he plays the game all the time oppose to husbands once a week, so of course hes going to be naturally better at the game, so dads only chance of victory is outsmarting him, so now he has an unfair advantage.

Is it fair? Husband got coffee for his weakness, son got mommy advice for his weakness.

I have four 30oz Stanley's (I actively use all of them), but the 40oz Elphaba was the first and only limited release I have cared anything about getting. My daughter does competitive cheer, and the gym's colors are emerald green, black, and gold, so this was an absolute must-have for cheer competitions! 🥹 I HAD TO HAVE IT. 

I had everything set up beforehand. Updated phone, strong internet signal, web browser open (instead of the app), billing and shipping info in my account, ect. I woke up at 2:30, refreshing the page occasionally, then started refreshing constantly at 2:55. The second the add to cart button lit up, I got the 40oz in my cart for local pickup, and tried to checkout instantly. Because I was fully prepared, it took less than 5 seconds from release to checkout. Someone still beat me to it, so I had to switch to shipping (which I was seriously trying to avoid), and ended up with the last one in stock online. Then, I quickly went back and snagged the last 20oz for local pickup to use for coffee. The transaction went through, and it said they would notify me when my order was ready for pickup. The entire process of completing both of these separate transactions only took 10-15 seconds, at most. I fell back asleep expecting to wake up, and go get my 20oz as soon as the store opened.

Unfortunately, I woke up to an email saying my local pickup item was out of stock, and I needed to either cancel my order, or choose to accept the replacement THEY chose for me, which was the 30oz Mist that we already have sitting in our cabinet. Of course I cancelled.

After the Love Shack Fancy fiasco with so many people receiving the wrong cups, and all the people receiving Target cups severely damaged during shipment, I just don't have high hopes for my 40oz. Five hours after ordering, I received an email saying my order was ready for shipment, and it had a UPS tracking number. However, UPS still says they don't have possession of the package. I guess once UPS has the package, I'll only have to worry if it's ACTUALLY the 40oz Elphaba in the box, or some other random Stanley, and if it comes damaged or not. 😭 

I guess the good thing is that it can be returned locally if it is damaged, but having to return it would mean I wouldn't have my perfect cheer mom cup for these competitions where I have to spend 10+ hours straight at a convention center full of screaming kids and overpriced food.

Hey fellow coffee enthusiasts!

I’ve been trying out different coffee brands using a pour over V60, but I don’t have a grinder, so I’ve been sticking to pre-ground coffee made for filter brewing. The problem is, my coffee is all over the place – sometimes it’s way too bitter, other times it’s super acidic, and occasionally it’s both!

I love coffee, but I’m getting kind of exhausted from brewing it because it never seems to turn out right anymore.

How do you brew your coffee? Any recommendations for good coffee brands?
