Hi, would love some ideas on how to improve the layout of this room in our NYC apartment.  We used a designer and we are so unhappy with how it turned out.  
The only thing that we are committed to keeping is the Restoration Hardware printmaker credenza (labeled here as sideboard) which was my first grown-up furniture purchase and I'm determined to find a place for it in our forever home, so we will hang on to it for the time being.   
  
Door in upper left side of the image leads to the kitchen and the doors in the bottom right lead to our office and bedroom, so we would likely ditch the two coffee tables in the middle because that's prime foot traffic.  
  
Wall colors are currently ""Warm Beige"" Arts and Crafts Collection from Sherwin Williams and I would like to leave that as is for now.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

I’m about 1 month post break up (our 3rd break up in 18months) and it has been really really bad for me like pit in stomach, constant anxiety etc…

But about a week ago I finally calmed down and was able to regulate myself. I was still blocked on everything so I decided to show up to a coffee shop that there was a good probably she would be at… guess what, she was there. 

We spoke outside and we both said we were sorry (it got kinda ugly on both sides, saying hurtful stuff we didn’t actually mean). We got on good terms, said sorry,  and said things that needed to be said but we’re not gonna get back together. I asked her if we could unblock and just coexist like normal human beings. She said “why… it’s not like we’re gonna follow eachother. We can’t do that” and then followed up with “I just need some time”. I thought okay well that’s better than nothing and we hugged and went separate ways. 

Fast forward 3 days later… I see that I’m unblocked on Instagram. I checked a couple hours after noticing and saw she changed her pfp to a picture of her that I always told her that I loved. Let that sit for a while then the next day DMd her “thinkin about you, hope you are okay”. She opened the DM and didn’t respond but kept me unblocked for the rest of the day (of course I was checking). When I checked again this morning, I had been blocked again. She must’ve done it early morning before 7am

What I’m wondering is… what is this block > unblock > change pfp to a me-coded picture > re-block

Is this a bread crumb? Was she doing it to get my validation and once she got it, reblocked me? 

I’ve been through multiple break up with this girl and this action is a new one I haven’t experienced…. Anyone got any insight?? ",1,1762207619.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

I am frustrated by what I precieve to be laziness on his part. I am bf and so I tend to our daughter primarily. However, in my head, if I am handling the child rearing, my husband should be stepping up to help with chores around the house. He works from home and I am still on maternity leave but I go back to work full time in the next week or so. I do not mind doing most of the child rearing and house work assuming that when he is not working he is helping take care of our daughter. However all he wants to do is half ass the chores I do ask him to do and ignore all the rest. He wants to go play golf and play video games which I was very clear was not going to happen as often when the baby was born. He does the bare minimum of what I tell him to and I have to tell him to do every little thing or he yells at me for not being specific enough. He then wonders why I get so pissy all the time. I genuinely dont know if he is fucking with me and he knows what he is doing or not. I have tried to talk to him about how alone this all makes me feel and how I try to put so much effort into our daily lives to make things easier for our family and to make things special for our daughter. He says he understands and apologizes but I havent seen a change. For example: 

I gave him a small list of things to do while I was out of the house running errands with the baby.I made it clear that when I came home I wanted to workout for an hour so he would need to watch the baby. One of the things pn his list was actually for him to sleep so we could have energy for the evening as babygirl has not been settling well the past couple of nights and I have to be up for work the next morning at 5am and could not be up all night fussing with the baby. Amping other things such as hang some pictures in her nursery and change rhe bedsheets. (Hubby, is on parental leave for another 4 weeks). I come home hours later to nothing on the list being done and him saying he has ""the whole day to do it"" (it was 4 at this point). He then wondered why I was so frustrated with him. Additonally, as I was getting ready to workout, he just puts the baby in a bouncer and proceeds to ignore her. I ask if he can do aome tummy time with her and interact with her and he looks at me like I took a shit in his coffee. 

I ask why he didnt at least sleep while I was gone since he says he is so tired all of the time and he says ""how do you expect me to sleep when I had coffee this morning"" I made him the coffee. He asked for it.

(Voice included),"Hi, I’m 6’0"", a person of color, rocking the certified dad bod (no kids, just snacks), and still someone who believes in the beauty of true connection. I think love lives in the little things: laughing until it hurts, holding hands on late-night walks, or splitting dessert while pretending we’re “too full.”



About me:



Food is my love language. Cooking, trying new spots, or just indulging in comfort food all make me happy.



I’m a lover of stories: books, anime, games, and travel. Basically anything that lets me escape into a new world.



I collect physical media because Wi-Fi can fail but my Blu-rays won’t.



I’m laid-back, affectionate, a little goofy, and believe love should be both playful and meaningful.



What I’m hoping for:

Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something lasting. I imagine stargazing together, rainy afternoons curled up under a blanket, and mornings that start with coffee but somehow turn into adventures. Bonus points if you don’t mind my bad puns or will hype me up while I try to bake cookies that may or may not come out edible.



If this made you smile, tell me your favorite comfort food or share the last silly thing that made you laugh way too hard. Who knows, maybe it’s the first page of our story.

He works very hard for me and our unborn baby (im due in about 2 weeks) im extremely grateful and try to express it as much as possible, but i feel i get no emotional support/reciprocation from him and its just gotten worse sense i got pregnant. I feel like im the last person to get his individual attention and i never hold it for long. He likes to stay busy which is okay but that never really seems to involve me anymore, granted I cant do a lot of the harder things that he does in my condition. But I clean the house, make sure he always has clean clothes and towels, I make him every meal, give him massages as he works hard labor, take care of all the animals, handle any and all billing or paperwork things and just do everything i can to make his day easier because he works so hard. He's always thankful, he brings me free plants from the stores before they throw them out which i love, does the dishes occasionally, and he does the heavy work outside turning what was a plot of dirt into a beautiful yard for our daughter which he loves doing too but, its like inside our relationship emotionally the same effort isnt there. He doesnt do sweet things just to do them anymore, doesnt touch me and love on me just because, he doesnt often tell me im pretty without prompting, I almost always initiate any sort of physical affection outside of the ocasional spicey time which has slowed sense i got pregnant, he doesnt try to or ask how he can help on days when i feel awful being almost 9 months pregnant with pots, rib slipping syndrome thanks to our wonderful daughter and occasional migraines which is new in this pregnancy, he never steps in to take some things off my plate on those bad days. Im kind of just on my own all the time, I organize the baby things, and plan everything out, I rub my own feet, legs and hands when they're so swollen they hurt, he tells me to take it easy and relax but doesnt do anything to allow me to do so because if i dont do it it just wont get done. I manage to brush/wash my own hair albeit with difficulty when our daughters dislocated one of my ribs, i can and have asked for help but he just forgets and I feel like a nag and a bother reminding him over such things. Even when we shower together also always at my request he just washes up and gets out while i stand there often left to finish up in cold water (i recently stopped making the effort to be romantic washing his body and scrubbing his scalp like i used too because he doesnt reciprocate it anymore) I make dinner every night whether i feel well or not which i usually enjoy as he loves my cooking but sometimes id like to be taken care of too, I dont always feel like making a meal but if i dont we wont eat. I have to ask for any pampering or spoiling and he just hardly tries and doesnt seem interested like hes ready to get it over with, its not the same having to ask for it anyway. He always remembers to grab himself some beer or nicotine on the way home but never thinks to grab me something i may want like a snack, I'll ask for the occasional iced coffee. I try not to ask for much and certainly not often as I stopped working during my first trimester (i was extremely sick, but after talking about it he loved the idea of me staying at home with our animals and our daughter and wanted to make that happen and in order to do that we moved 3,000 miles across the country away from my family and everything ive known when I was 7 months pregnant and were still leveling out financially after the move) even when i ask him to he often forgets and i wont bring it up because i dont want him to feel bad for forgetting but its just that, I feel forgotten. I think hes run me a bath without me asking him once, years ago. I feel like theres no romantic effort anymore, he doesnt cuddle up to me and love on me. He doesnt feel my belly without prompting, I can count how many dates weve been on on one hand. I dont think hes ever really gone out of his way to plan somthing for me or do something for me just to make me feel good without prompting. Granted hes planning on building us a house on this property one day, but that somehow doesnt make me feel better. He doesnt flirt with me anymore, even when Im flirty with him he just repeats what i say back to me and goes about his business. I love him so much, and hes a wonderful man that does so much for me and our little family but i feel like a ghost. I have to ask for love and attention, and i do but im hardly induldged maybe for a moment and it still just doesnt feel as genuine or like theres any real care or thought of me when I have to ask him to love me. I dont want him to feel bad, or like im attacking him its not like he mistreats me i just feel such a sadness and hole in my heart like hes grown bored of me. Like hes so concered with everything and anything else i just become an afterthought. I try to look nice for him, do my hair and makeup before he gets home but it doesnt make any difference after our first greeting when he gets home if he notices. Im not sure what to do really, because hes very good to me and always has been its like he just doesnt think about these kinds of things or my feelings at all really. He's honestly very absent minded at times and I dont think his behavior is malicious or intentional and im not angry but I dont feel seen and loved either.",1,1762206879.0,Husband,0,1.0,False

Looking for some advice. I (early 30s, M) go to my local gym pretty regularly, and a few weeks ago I had a short conversation with a girl in the sauna. She’s early 20s, seemed friendly, and we chatted a bit. Nothing crazy.

Fast forward to today — we ended up in the sauna at the same time again and ended up talking for about twenty minutes. It wasn’t forced at all, we had a lot in common, and the vibe was just really chill and comfortable.

I didn’t ask for her number or anything — partly because I didn’t want to be “that guy” who makes someone uncomfortable at the gym. But now I’m wondering if I should ask her out (or at least ask if she’d want to grab a coffee) the next time I see her. 

Is it weird to ask someone out in a gym/sauna setting? Should I keep it casual, keep talking, and see if the chance comes up again? Or am I just overthinking this?

I've been really struggling since July, and doing worse since mid-September. I had to take care of some extremely triggering tasks on Saturday, so on Sunday, I decided to treat myself to breakfast out, a nice walk exploring a pretty neighborhood, and hitting up some vintage thrift shops.

I felt so miserable, but I was trying so hard to be grateful, observant, and positive. It felt like so many people were kind that day - like a woman let me cross the street and just smiled so broadly and warmly when I waved a thanks at her. I tried to notice everything good. I was in a safe neighborhood. It was early afternoon. I didn't even have headphones on. I looked alert and present. Elderly people were walking around, people with babies in strollers. Things seemed fine, but I was still alert, of course; I had a switchblade and alarm on me, like I always do.

Some guy started following me in his car, catcalling me, and pulling over on the wrong side of the road (to be closer to where I was walking), where there were no open shops, to wait for me to walk past him. I had to backtrack and hide from him in a coffee shop (the owner and barista were amazing men who took me seriously, gave me free coffee, and were ready to kill this guy) for like an hour as he kept circling the block waiting for me to come back. I felt so sick and shaky at first, as soon as I realized these guys were helping me, but I tried to focus on their kindness.

When he finally really left, I went to my shop and forced myself to notice all the kind people and try to have fun. Then, on the way home, a *different* guy slowed down and catcalled, and then got mad and started yelling as he drove away when I ignored him. An older guy slowed down his car to ask if I was okay after - I answered that I was, because I assumed he had heard the other guy and was worried. But no, he hadn't heard or didn't care, just said I looked too tired to walk so he pulled over (he couldn't see my face while driving, and I was walking normally) and tried to get me to agree to get in his car with him, and got angry when I kept saying no and walking.

I'm so sick of it. I wake up every morning lately sweaty from all the flashbacks and panic attacks while I slept. I feel so terrified of any man who is sexually interested in me, because so many have assaulted or abused me. Since I was fucking 8. I'm fucking 41 now. I'm tired. I'm so tired.

I've basically lost hope that I'll ever, ever sleep with a man who actually loves me and wants me in a safe, honest, real, mutual way. I've never had that. I don't think I will. It kills me. But whatever.

But can't I at least fucking go for a walk on a Sunday afternoon without being terrified? Without having to hide? Without every fear that my CPTSD makes me feel being proven right? I don't want to be so scared. I want to think about the guys in the coffee shop. But I get worried they'd hurt me the same way if they had the chance - if they were alone or bored or I annoyed them until they realized they feel fine hurting me.

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+

First a bit about me and my preferences. My names Nicole I’m 19 years old and I’m Canadian on EST. I would like for this roleplay to be in first person and as for length and detail some scenes call for something long with incredible amounts of detail to get it just right where as other can be a bit shorter. I’m not overly picky just don’t send me a one liner and we will do just fine.

Now for the roleplay itself the title is kinda a dead giveaway but I’ve been super into bigger age gaps recently and would like to roleplay with something of the sorts.

Now if it were to start from them meeting and getting into a relationship I work in the trades and I think it would be cool if maybe I was a new hire and the owner of the company saw me on a job site thinking maybe I’m health and safety or someone’s sister. He comes up and asks me on a date. Now him being the big burly sexy man of my dreams I of course say yes plus the fact I’m also unaware he’s my boss! And later on down the line we find that out and it’s a fun slightly forbidden romance. (That would of course end in marriage)

Or we can start where they’re already married and this can go many many different ways. From them having maybe had a one nightstand then ran into eachother at a coffee shop a little while later and decided to go in a real date never looking back from there or we can follow the same plot of her being his employer just much later on down the line.

I’m open to discussion with both versions and we can discuss whether they have kids or pets and where they live! I’m super excited for the world building portion of this plot and look forward to meeting anyone that would like to play these roles with me😘",0,1762206522.0,roleplaying,0,0.5,False

1onp5s8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1onp5s8,Feedback on buildingsteps to make this penbox?,"I’m looking for some advice on how to approach this project. My aim is to make a little penbox – bit of a motivational encouragement for le girlfriend who’s considering of doing an extra school. I’m quite new to woodworking, but I do know my way around tools. I once made a desk top and matching cabinet (very simple). I have access to most tools that I think I’ll need due to an open-workshop program not far from my place, I’m already enrolled for a mandatory machine safety workshop in about two weeks and then I can get this cranked out.

Some dimensions:

\-          wall thickness 5mm;

\-          Depth 56mm; Width 210mm; Height with lid: 40mm

\-          Radius on both ends of the shape: 25mm (semicircle)

I’d like to combine three woodtypes and have the endgrain facing upward. I’d really like to have the lid and box made from the same block so all grains follow the same pattern, though I’m not too sure how realistic this is with the hinge design I have in mind. That hinge would be a TIG-welding rod of 2mm going through a hole – ideally end to end but we see how we fare.  

My plan of attack for this:

1)      Look for machined slabs that have each their intended width (28, 7, 13, 8 mm) and glue clamp them together.

2)      After drying cut a cube with the right depth and width (210 \* 56 mm) and go a bit larger on the height

3)      Using a bandsaw cut to the hinge design coming from the front and both sides. Then using a dremel from the top to cut away the lid from the hinge. The bandsaw takes away some of the height, the lid cut off. Plane it so it becomes 5mm and plane the hinge of the box. This would basically guarantee the grain flows nicely from the box into the lid.

4)       With everything still square, clamp the lid back to the base (maybe with the smallest offset in between so it doesn’t fit too tight (a sheet or 5 of paper). And use a 2mm drillbit to drill a 2mm hole that goes through the lid’s side into the protrusion of the base block. To get from the side of the block to the face edge of the protrusion it is 66mm. I have found drillbits of 2\*200mm.

5)      Using a router drill at the center of each circle, use the guide that comes with it and make two semi circles (Outside first, then inside) of the actual penbox (lid stays square for now).

6)      Connect the semicircles using the router (inside only – outside is already cut to side). With a forster bit, hollow it out until about 25mm depth, the remaining 5mm should be done with the router to avoid pits etc…

7)      Put the lid on the box- use a wooden sate stick to connect them and take it to a belt-sander. Round of the lid so it matches the box

8)      With the palm router, give everything a chamfer and put the tig-rod it, round it off with a metal file and use epoxy glue on the outsides only. (Propbably will have to sand the rod a little to avoid stressing the material too much.

9)      Have a coffee.

How realistic is this plan? Any steps I’m doing in the wrong order/have forgotten? Perhaps a stupid question, but how do I calculate the chamfer needed to actually make the lid open – as it is designed now, this thing won’t open.

My main worry is step 3: how realistic is this kind of cut? ",2,1762206521.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,1,1.0,False

My last relationship/siruation I felt blind sided by her. We were spending loads of time together she was talking about future plans & asked me to meet her family then just got quiet one day & emotionally said shes so torn went away for a week (a really shit week for me) came back and decided we needed to break up without much explanation. 

The last major relationship I had she was extremely avoidant. As with most relationships the start was amazing we are all over each other but when things got serious she starts massively pulling away. Days to a week with no contact I tried to be understanding of her style & left her to it even though I was miserable tried talking to her about it.. absolutely no compromise.

My engagement that I broke off she demanded that I moved to another country so she could be near her family which I said yes but I'm not going to commit to forever. Nope not good enough so I ended it. 

Where am I now? Met someone IRL at the gym I have started coaching at. Talked a little bit we recently realised we live in the same block of flats (just moved) I have been meaning to ask her out but I was scrolling the apps & I come across her profile.. a low moment i couldnt resist asking if she wanted to get coffee on the app not sure if shes seen the message but no response yet. 

Not sure if I should mention it but freaking out a little about it now. I literally could go upstairs & ask her. Obviously I wont as I'm not crazy but god why is this so hard to find someone I am at my wits end I don't know if I should mention it to her when I next see her.

I fucked up a lot last year during my depression. I was a student, and I was drinking every night, alone, with my roommates in the next room.
I ended up in the hospital 3 times because I harmed myself. I remember telling the doctors that I was ""bored"".

I stopped drinking january first this year. Got out of depression. Got diagnosed with ADHD. Got better overall.

However it seems like I only seem to be able to jump from an addiction to another. I realised that I have been an addict my whole life. 
Video games, sugar, weed, alcohol, xanax, porn, coffee, food, even running.
Of course some are worse than others.

A few months ago the frustration towards alcohol was unbearable. All my friends were drinking at every event. I couldnt walk past a bar without wanting to buy a pint. I just thought that allowing myself a drink, with friends, once in a while would be okay. I want to say that it worked for a while but the truth is that if I wasn't living with my boyfriend I would be drinking as much as I used to.

I am tired, I just want peace. And a beer, and a cigarette, and a whole tablet of chocolate.

I'm scared I'll feel like this my whole life. And relapse hard everytime something remotely bad happens in my life.

Im 5'10 and I currently weigh around 264 with an a1c that is slightly elevated at 5.9. I have worked my ass off at the gym and I may lose a pound or two but I dont see any results. 

Since high school i have gained about 70 lbs and the reason for that is I love to eat and I love carbs. Under normal circumstances when it comes to food I have a cadence of eating 3 meals per day. During the week I eat 2 bagels and have 2 cups of coffee for breakfast. For lunch I will make a turkey sandwich with chips and coke zero and for dinner I eat salmon or chicken with boiled white rice and strawberries. During the weekend I pig out and eat out at chipolte or canes. Sometimes I will order a large cheese pizza and I have to stop myself from eating the entire thing. 

Now as far as I know, when I am on the meds I wont be able to do this or frankly want to do this. Usually when we eat, the body releases GLP 1 which tells the brain that we are full.

1onp00e,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleephackers/comments/1onp00e/tldr_built_a_bt_remote_to_autoskip_ads_in/,"TL;DR: Built a BT remote to auto-skip ads in YouTube/podcasts without touching your phone—eyes closed, no light/movement. Game-changer for sleep hygiene.","As a former insomniac who's finally got my sleep hygiene dialed in, I wanted to share something that's become an absolute game-changer for my routine. I built a product for myself, I scratched my own itch. Like many of you, I rely on YouTube videos or podcasts as background noise to wind down—it's like a modern lullaby that quiets my racing thoughts and eases me into sleep. I just love the recommendation engine, and there is always something there interesting enough but not too interesting to be stimulating. Since ad blocking has been blocked, ads popping up shatter that calm: I'd have to fumble for my phone in the dark, expose myself to bright screens, and physically move from my comfy position just to skip them. That unavoidable light and disruption during sleep onset latency? Total killer for ramping down to actual rest.

Enter SemiPremium, a little hardware device I built specifically to solve this. It's a Bluetooth remote that automates ad skipping (or time-skipping in podcasts) with the press of a button—literally. No apps, no subscriptions, just seamless HID simulation that keeps the flow going. For anyone practicing good sleep hygiene but still using audio/video to fall asleep, it's essential. It eliminates that forced physical movement and light exposure, letting you stay in bed, eyes closed, and drift off uninterrupted. Skip ads and fast forward over ad segments in both videos and podcasts, without moving and with closed eyes.

Due to my previous almost terminal sleep onset insomnia which was solved not by SemiPremium, but through a series of efforts which is mostly behavioral interventions and habit systems with CBT-I playing a huge part for a series of initial positive experiences, I am and have become hypersensitive to any form of external influence or unexpected sensory stimuli during sleep onset latency. I usually start the day by beginning to go to bed, 16 hours later in the day. It starts with a Sanolux lamp tilted in my face for 10-15 minutes while squinting and sometimes sneezing, to achor my circadian rhythm. That is the first thing I do when I wake up. When I have done everything right until bedtime, I clearly notice spikes, both increases in alertness and wakefulness and keep track of any disruptive elements for continuous mitigation or removal through behavioral interventions. Using the phone in bed is one of them, but at the same time - nothing is better than it. I don't like monotonous and the same, I crave variation and something interesting enough to hook my attention to and YouTube is perfect for that. But light exposure is a no-go, and this over the years has become a unavoidable guilty pleasure. Using the phone for background entertainment reduces my sleep onset latency, compared to quiet or a white noise machine. What happens when an ad starts is that my sympathetic nervous system is activated, and the longer the ad and the more annoying it is, the more frustrated I get, then the frustration turns to mild anger, with noises and changes in volume which is not the chosen stimuli, the chosen tonality or pitch or expected context, and the more wake and alert I become - especially when I get a 40 minute infomercial with guitar lessons as a part of my chosen video to doze off to, and HAD to move to press skip.

If this sounds familiar, check out the demo videos on my Tindie store. Just search for SemiPremium on Tindie or ""SemiPremium - iOS demo or SemiPremium - Android demo"" on YouTube. They've got real-world examples of how it works with YouTube and podcasts. Would love to hear if others here deal with the same ad-interruption frustration, and if the solution I've made for myself makes sense for others. I made it in a vacuum, and developed it without asking for any feedback on the idea, concepts, layout, design or functions underway. 

I'm curious to hear feedback and if the solution is a good fit for the problem. I am the founder and inventor, I did the product design, architected the system, designed the workflow and wrote the firmware, took me a few months, and now in the process of daily testing. I am also in the process of getting this product out there, and have kept it secret and stayed in stealth mode, and gradually realized that the problem being solved actually is a global health problem with hundreds of millions of daily active users indulging in the same habit, where 10 % has Premium. A lot of harm is caused by this habit, and I am building an alternative so there is an option other than subscribing to Premium, and also for those who pay for Premium and still have to suffer through the in-content ad-reads by the creators. During the daytime, I have no issues with it, but during the night, when ad frequency for skippable ads are ramped up to drive Premium-subscription conversion through disruption of people sleep and pure annoyance, I do have a big problem with that.

Sleep is fragile, and people don't get enough of it. Society is blind to the detrimental effects of technological disruption of the number one most important element of physical and mental health - sleep. Enough of it, and good quality. For those where it is extra fragile, an interruption while being close to sleep onset can result in no sleep the entire night, going to work the next day and paying the price of sleep deprivation for days.

The phone is used in bed by the majority of the population in the western hemisphere. Sleep experts and scientists say the phone should not be in the bedroom, but it is and will be for the foreseeable future. So what causes interactions with the device, and can those interactions be done with something else than a photon emitting primary navigation interface (touch-screen) through a thing with tactile buttons where you feel the button icon so no vision is required to operate it? It seems like it can, for controlling background entertainment such as YouTube or podcasts.

Social media is a different animal, and people who are using social media in bed, I think, has no right to complain about lack of sleep, bad sleep or taking too long to fall asleep. It is almost like having a cup of coffee before sleep and wondering why it doesn't happen. What I do get is why people do it, and that is absence of thinking while doing it. Being entertained, but in this setting the dosage is too high. There are better sorts of entertainment out there, and you don't want to interact with an algorithm communication with you through a handheld audiovisual rectangle with superpowers andone goal in mind... To ding-ding-ding in your dopaminergic system and fire up your reward circuitry to max, keep you engaged and increase the session time; before that person close their eyes and expect the adenosine to singlehandedly do the job for both the pineal gland and squirt out some melatonin while magically activating the parasympathetic nervous system in a few minutes. That requires darkness for a while before going to sleep, relaxation with reduced or absence of stimulating sensory input and exposure to lots of LUX as soon as possible after getting up the same day. Adenosine (increases with waking hours) + melatonin (increases in darkness) + parasympathetic nervous system activation (increases with relaxation and absence of both physical and digital stimulation). Those are the three most important factors in facilitating sleep onset transition.

For this reason, I chose not to include functions for scrolling up and down in social media, although it could potentially be lucrative. Then get a CheerTok. SemiPremium is a sleep onset facilitation device, or a sleep onset acceleration device in system speak. It eliminates movement and light, while preserving the possibility to use the phone as a modern lullaby.

I derive great pleasure from being able to solve this for other insomniacs and people suffering from sleep disorders or disturbances. Being forced and spoon fed ads in the sanctuary, the bed. After all the tasks for the day has been completed, no more things to do, no more effort required - no more movements. Just rest until it happens, and then the next thing is the next day. No demands, and whatever is on the to-do-list has to wait until the next day. But just get Premium has become an argument people actually use when describing this problem. I think more people would be Premium-subscribers it the conversion funnel wasn't driven be moments of pulling out hair and being annoyed at the exactly wrong time at night and having to get up on the elbow, get the eyes to adjust to the brightness which hasn't been turned down, then finding the little button and missing it while pointing and using a touch interface through the shoulder, elbow, wrist and finally finger, and accidentally opening the ad-page for the advertiser, having to relocate the finger to press the little x, then actually hitting the skip button, putting the phone back where it belongs and getting back to rest, head back on the pillow. But now wide awake, again. In the process there, somewhere, people grab their credit card and just fill it in. Finally some rest. And then, finally, problem solved..? Then the new favorite channel has a creator who embeds four 2 minute ad-read segments in the 45-minute videos. Then asking the question.... But I pay for Premium. Then thinking, Oh, so it was just that one type of ad, not the other?

Also got some staples - chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, steak and strawberries. I am so grateful I am able to do this now - I was so proud and felt so accomplished! Also excited to try my treats!

I am though VERY worried I am developing nearly like a binging issue. I don't really know because I haven't 'binged' before but, I just feel the amount I am now eating is quite a lot and it is a lot of sweet/sugary stuff.

Brynn Sinclair loves alpine skiing, hates mornings, and might have finally found the man of her dreams in Jake Evans. But between her own fears, digital misfortune, cold feet, and an ill-timed rockslide, their path to love isn't exactly smooth skiing. If Brynn can't navigate her way down this trail, she might lose her best shot yet at true love. It's only her happily ever after at stake, though, nothing to worry about… right?

---

## Chapter 1

Brynn hated mornings. The cold. The bright sunlight. Being forced from the comfort of her bed and the refuge of sleep. Her idea of the perfect morning was one slept entirely through; her idea of the perfect breakfast was an early lunch. But some things warranted morning, and this was one of them. There was still something special to her about the perfect morning, hatred and all. Something visceral about watching the sun brighten a dark sky, painting colors upon the undersides of clouds. Winter mornings, in particular, had a liminal quality. The chill. The frost. The snow. 

The sun was just beginning to paint the eastern sky when she pulled into the snowy lot. Stifling another yawn and taking a final sip from her thermos before opening the door, Brynn stepped into the cold morning air. Only two things in this world could consistently compel her to forgo her proclivity to sleep in, and this was her preferred of the two. By far.

She sat to exchange her shoes for boots before flipping open the latches atop her car to pull down a set of long, slender skis. With a few taps of a pole to dislodge the snow from each boot, she clicked their toes into her skis. Adjusting her headband and poles, she took a few gliding steps toward a pair of groomed tracks, letting her momentum carry her across the fresh snow until she could plant her poles and step into the grooves. And then, with one final adjustment, she set out.

It was a quiet morning, in that way that fresh snowfall makes the entire world, deadening all sound, muting even the normal *skish skish skish* of skis upon snow. She had opted against the music she normally wore in her ears, wanting instead to immerse herself in that quiet. Before long, it was disrupted, if it could be called a disruption, by her breathing. For the better part of an hour, she skied through a landscape made magical by the new snow until, at the top of a rise, she let her momentum slow to a halt and stood motionless in the quiet, steaming hot breath into the chill air as she took in the sight of the sunrise.

*Worth it, for this.*

She stayed a long moment in that stillness, and probably would have stayed even longer if it weren't for the beckoning call of the only other reason she tolerated being up early. Work. With a small sigh, she put her skis back to the tracks and resumed the gliding exertion.

By the time she finished the trail and reached her car, the sun had risen in full—though the broken clouds allowed only glimpses of it—and her thermos had cooled to the perfect temperature. Savoring a few warm sips of the coffee after cleaning and re-racking her skis, Brynn pulled out her phone to discover a message from Jake awaiting her.

Jake. The most promising prospect she'd found on the Pine app in months. That in itself wasn't saying much, poor as the fodder of dating apps tended to be, but in Jake's case, it should have. Or, maybe, it said something about how far above the rest he stood. It made her smile just to see the notification bearing his picture.

*Good morning! How was the skiing?*

*How'd you know I was skiing?*

*Oh, please, four inches of fresh snow* and *they groomed today? I'm surprised you didn't call out of work.*

*You know me too well, haha…*

*Well, you didn't exactly make it all that challenging for me, in this case :).*

*I might resent that remark if you weren't so right.*

*You could never resent me. You like me too much for that.*

*Never say never…*

*Never ever. Never ever ever. Ever.*

Brynn couldn't help letting out a chuckle as she climbed into her car, pulling the door closed behind her and peeling off the headband as she turned the key.

*If you weren't so cute, I might not let you get away with that. I have to go, work isn't going to do itself. Talk later?*

*Sounds good, have a good day!*

Driving home to shower before work under the early sun always felt a bit odd. Like getting picked up from school for a doctor's appointment. Swimming upstream. Playing hooky. The feeling dissipated at the door to her apartment, though, and as she closed it behind her to head for the bedroom, Brynn found her thoughts drifting again to Jake. The way they seemed to have developed a habit of doing. Particularly when she was getting ready to shower. Something about peeling her clothes off one by one.

She was interrupted by the ding of a notification. And it brought with it the same jolt of sickening dread that it had every other time for months. At least it was starting to diminish.

*Why do I even still have those notifications enabled?*

With a sigh, she picked it up, obeying something akin to compulsion. Some urge she was not yet in control of.

*Because you're not over him yet. Obviously.*

The last thing she needed was to be checking Aiden's social media posts. Which is why she was. She couldn't help it. Some part of her just needed to know. Even though she already knew what was coming. Knew who she would see. Mindy. His newest edition in a line of short-lived relationships. Admittedly, Mindy *had* lasted longer than any previous model. The fact that she was intimidatingly beautiful didn't help Brynn's jealousy. At all. Nor did the way she was practically hanging off of him.

*How the hell does Aiden Glass get a woman like that to spend more than five seconds with him? Better question: how did he ever get* me *to spend more than five seconds with him?*

Brynn knew firsthand, though, just how charming Aiden could be. Maybe not a good man. Not always the most moral or kind. But definitely charming, much as she didn't like to admit it. Maybe that was why it stung to see another gorgeous woman clutching his arm. Or maybe it was what seeing all these beautiful women with Aiden meant for Brynn. If he was the best they could do…

With a grunt of disdain issued from between gritted teeth and pursed lips, Brynn closed the app, setting her phone on the bathroom counter as steam started to rise. With the water up to temperature, Brynn stepped in. Morning showers were the worst. No time to enjoy them. No time to luxuriate under the warm water the way her muscles begged her to every single time. And the air always felt colder than it should have.

Frustratingly quick shower finished and hair dried, Brynn snatched her phone on her way to the closet. And her reaction to the notification that greeted her this time formed a strong contrast with her reaction to Aiden's.

*Hey, quick question, does now count as later?*

*I am certain, Jake, that you know it does not.*

*Hmm… seems to. I mean, it is later, and we are talking, so…*

*Your logic is unassailable. Clearly.*

*You can assail it all you want, as long as it means I get to keep talking to you.*

Assailing his logic was not the only thing Brynn was thinking of doing. But she didn't say as much.

*It will have to wait until tonight, I'm afraid.*

*Ah, more careful with your phrasing this time, I see. Very well, I look forward to having my logic assailed at length this evening. Have a good day at work, Brynn.*

*You too, Jake.*

With a smile, Brynn pocketed the phone. Talking about 'assailing' Jake's 'logic' while getting dressed was a recipe for a very specific brand of smile. And it was one that did not fade all through the car ride to work. Even walking up the stairs and into the lab didn't diminish it. Not even when Brynn deposited her laptop and connected it to the monitor, letting the machine wake as she went to the coffee maker, did it cease. She was still smiling that Jake smile when a familiar voice finally robbed her of it, making her fight the urge to flinch as she turned to face him. It was turning into a bit of a whipsaw morning.

""Hey!""

""Hey, Aiden.""

""How's it going?""

""Alright. You?""

""Great! Yeah, really great. Mindy and I just got back from Gold Fork. Spent the weekend.""

Gold Fork. The place Aiden had taken her for their first trip together. The place where they hadn't gotten dressed or left the hotel room for four days. The place that Brynn had not been back to since he left her. The place he had just gotten back from taking another woman.

*You remember it, don't you? Remember all the things you did with him? He just got back from doing that with another girl. How are you still upright?*

Maybe she had finally moved on enough. Maybe it was what she had sparked with Jake. It still stung, of course, but it didn't have that familiar bite to it. There was a time it would have laid her low for days. A week, even. Evidently, those days were past, and good riddance. It didn't stop the venom from dripping between clenched teeth and into her voice, though.

""Sounds amazing.""

""Yeah, it was. Really was. The rooms all have their own private pool fed by the hot spring, and the views are just—""

""I've been, Aiden. Several times.""

The look of confusion. The realization. It was theatrical. A play acted out for an audience of one. Trust Aiden to stoop to the level of pretending he didn't remember.

""Oh, right… Yeah, of course.""

She let the conversation lull into an uncomfortable silence. One which she hoped he felt. One which his shifting feet told her he felt.

*Good. Bastard deserves it. Pretending he doesn't remember.*

Brynn needed to get over him. Needed to stop being petty, but he was still matching her in that. Clearly. And Brynn didn't have it in her to be the better person, not yet anyway. Maybe someday. Soon, she hoped. Aiden cleared his throat as she stirred her coffee, drawing an expectant eyebrow from her.

""So, uh… how's work? You discover any new hoofers yet?""

*Hoofers. For fuck's sake, Aiden.*

""Not yet.""

As if that was what her research was even about. Ridiculous. But Aiden had never missed an opportunity to put her work down. How had she never noticed that when they were together? Had she really been so blinded by affection? Had she dismissed it as humor? Had it *been* humor, once?

""Ah, that's too bad. Always next year, though.""

""Year's not even over yet, dipshit…""

""Hmm? What was that?""

*Oh, nothing, just wondering what Mindy could possibly see in you. Wondering what I ever saw in you.*

""Nothing, just, uh… nothing.""

""Well… alright-y, then. Um, catch you later, I suppose?""

""I suppose.""

""Alright, then. Later, Brynn.""

""Bye, Aiden.""

The smile from talking to Jake thoroughly defeated by the brief exchange with Aiden, Brynn made her way back to her desk wearing a scowl. At least she had coffee. Slumping into her chair, she got to work. But she didn't get more than twenty minutes in before Morgan appeared, cheerily sliding into her own seat beside Brynn.

""Good morning!""

""I beg to differ.""

""I expect nothing less.""

""Mm-hmm.""

""That being said, I do usually get a 'morning' at least… do I detect a case of the—?""

""You do, indeed.""

""Oh?""

""Yep.""

""And…?""

Brynn typed silently for a moment, not turning to face her friend. Morgan would press it, she knew. And Brynn would tell her, she knew that too. Still, Brynn didn't speak, waiting instead for the inevitable follow-up. Eventually, Morgan issued it, just as expected.

""Ah, come on, Brynn, you know you can talk to me. And you know it helps.""

With a sigh, Brynn relented, also as expected, and finally turned to face her friend.

""He just got back from a trip. To Gold Fork. With his most recent exploit. And pretended he didn't even remember taking me.""

Morgan drew back with a wince and an exaggerated grimace.

""Oof, babe… How are you not a puddle on the floor yet?""

""He doesn't deserve that, for starters.""

""Never stopped you before.""

""Ain't that the truth?""

""Does this mean you're over him now?""

""Getting there.""

""Hell yeah, babe! Go you!""

""Thanks… anyways, how's the owl surv—""

""Ugh, worst subject change ever! You are going to make me retract my good morning.""

""That bad, huh?""

""Worse, even. I'm going to need at least another two nights of data. Three more cold ass days in the cold ass woods.""

""So… you say you're unhappy, when in reality you're…?""

""Borderline ecstatic? How could you tell?""

""Three days out of the lab at this time of year? I don't think there's anything you're not willing to do for that.""

""The list includes several felonies, if not more… So, you in?""

""What do you mean?""

""You know exactly what I mean. I'm sure you've got trail cams you could check.""

The singsong voice was not needed to convince Brynn. She definitely wanted to go—and knew it—but still she hesitated. It *would* be three cold ass days in the cold ass woods, after all. But that would beat the hell out of three days in proximity to Aiden. She eyed Morgan sidelong for a moment in consideration before relenting.

""I suppose you've had worse ideas.""

""I sure have. Remember David?""

""I will never forget David. Nor will I ever let you forget David.""

""I expect nothing less… So, what do you think? Next week? You, me, one last hurrah before proposal season?""

""Twist my arm.""

""Yes! Your car or mine?""

""Yours is tiny!""

""Yeah, so? Gets from A to B, doesn't it?""

""Sure, without two people's worth of skis and gear, it does.""

""Ugh, rude. But actually, though, yours would be much better. I just didn't want to volunteer it on your behalf.""

""That has *never* stopped you before, Morgs. Why start now?""

""Turning over a new leaf?""

""Believe it when I see it.""",1,1762206065.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

so, i've picked up (via a blind box) some mixed sand from geek gaming scenics that looks cracking in the packet/box, but clumps terribly when glued down (and even worse when sealed). i'm just using water-thinned pva, which works fine with my other basing materials of choice (miniature railroad ballast, cork ""boulders"", and dessicated coffee grounds), but i'm sure there's probably something about the fineness of the grain here that is making my choice of glue less suitable. would it be worth changing the dilution (more water? less?) or just switching to another product entirely? ggs apparently have their own brand of quick-setting basing glue, but if it's just pva/white glue with a different label on it, i'd rather try modifying my existing process before buying another product that might just throw up the exact same problem again.

The pattern was always the same: watch tutorial videos for hours, download/install resources, pause constantly to switch to my code editor, get stuck on something small, and go on an endless search to find the answer, then the app I was trying to build didn't render, lose momentum, and abandon learning.

With AI/no-code tools, it is possible to create entire apps, but there's no learning, and as a result, hard to debug. 

I'm now building an app that helps you learn coding with AI teachers. The app combines learning and coding on the same screen through interactive videos, so you're actively building while learning. You can choose from micro courses like 'build a todo list app' or 'build a website for a coffee shop', or 'build a memory game'.  

Why I think this might work better for ADHD brains:

* Constant hands-on engagement (not passive watching)
* No installing editors, plugins, or debugging setup issues
* Make code changes and see results instantly without leaving your screen
* 5-20 minute micro-courses broken into 1-3 minute lessons
* Building something tangible from minute 1

Some pretty significant neurological issues that lead to me no longer being able to exercise.  \~20 days of water fasting, and 5 days of green tea drinking.  I was planning on drinking coffee initially, but realized I just didn't care or need it right then.

  
My biggest lesson learned is:

I can live without food for a while, no 3 meals a day needed, none of this other garbage.  I can apply the same determination and willpower I use in my daily life to food, its no different.

  
Ill do a more detailed writeup at the end of the week.  

Down to the real talk, some of these may be due to my physical disability interactions:

  
I planned on going 45d or more since I'm pretty ok with the not eating thing, just miss food flavors.

I take all the previous medicine I was on, and some extra vitamins and TUDCA + Amino acids.

I haven't had any of the energy, mental clarity, or anything else people end up reporting.  Yes I get plenty of electrolytes/water (light wheat colored urine).  It has sapped my ability to things physically effectively, and I haven't been able to sleep / concentrate.  I kind of zone out most days.  I do perhaps feel a bit calmer at times, might be from the zoning out hah.

I am on blood pressure medicine (heart rate / bp function is affected by health issues).  I think part of the problem may be my blood pressure being pretty low for me 105/65 at times.

During the process I have had multiple blood draws, MRI with contrast, infusions, and other medical things done OK.

The reason I have decided to end at 30d is over the weekend I ended up legit feinting, never done it before in my life, little crazy.  Was bending over and standing up quite a bit then walking. 

Starting to have mild kidney pain too.  

Anyway not all sunshine and roses.  I have my standard medical blood draw coming up this week along with infusions.  I will share the results of the blood draw and the full writeup at the end of the week.

I also realize fasting with medical conditions can be dangerous, and wouldn't recommend anyone else doing it without Dr advice. Mine suggested various diets of elimination / etc to try to help the symptoms.  It wasn't why I started this journey, but it also showed it didn't really make any difference.",19,1762205456.0,fasting,3,1.0,False

1onomt3,https://i.redd.it/blmharu614zf1.jpeg,Help w/ decorating my first apartment!,"Hey everyone!

My wife and I are moving into a new apartment soon, and I want to surprise her by decorating it before she moves in. She loves earth tones and neutral, moody colors. Something like a gray or beige couch, a brown coffee table, and a beige rug.

I was thinking about getting an L-shaped, four-piece sectional for the living room, but I’m worried it might make the space feel smaller. The couch is supposed to go to the left side of the living room and the right is for the TV. The room measures about 14’10” x 11’3”, and there’s a bit of an awkward slant in that left area that I’m not sure how to work around.

Any ideas or suggestions for decor, color combinations, or how to make that slanted area feel more natural would be super appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

A metropolitan area of almost million where there seems to be almost no public transit, and every single person has a car. And every one of those cars is on the road at all times. You might think your car is in the garage right now, but it's actually out driving. It's the only explanation for how packed these giant roads are.


Every place I went to, I would have to weigh it my head, questioning whether I really wanted to drive that 1 mile to get coffee knowing that it will be a drive that takes ten minutes, and that it will be a miserable, hectic, stressful ten minutes. After a few days I was literally cutting out places I wanted to visit just because I didn't want to drive there. You've got 5 lane stroads going through residential areas, everywhere. I doubt there's a place in this city you can go where you can't hear the river of steel. Do you guys know it's not like this everywhere? The Chicago metropolitan area has about ten times the population of the Boise metropolitan area. Do you feel like you have one tenth of the services? I don't.



And I've got some more complaining to do. What state capital museum charges admission? Only the trashy ones! and why are there no major parks with big tail systems within the city? That's normal for a metropolitan area, but missing here. Maybe you can go to eagle island if you like driving 30 minutes in hell, but it's just as quick to drive outside town. It's a bizarre feeling to be in a western state known for it's natural beauty, but having it be too far a drive to get to. 

In conclusion, I'm gonna come back to Boise in 50 years, and you guys better have your act together.",0,1762205179.0,Boise,44,0.38,False
1onojtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/guineapigs/comments/1onojtd/making_pigs_less_reactive_to_foodbag_sounds/,Making pigs less reactive to food/bag sounds? (Misophonia - their sounds are now painful),"This is a SERIOUS REQUEST FOR HELP. Please be respectful. I love my pigs, and I didn't ask for this to happen and it is horrible.

TLDR QUESTION: Has anyone managed to get them to stop yelling in response to a bag or vegetable chopping sounds? I can usually handle incidental wheeking, but my brain short circuits every time I have to chop a vegetable for dinner and they won't stop yelling (actually only 2 of the 4 are really noise-reactive, but sometimes they convince the others to join in). Being unable to escape from the sound is part of the problem.

DETAILS:

I am neurodivergnt and have misophonia (fight or flight response to certain sounds) that has excluded my various pigs for 35 years, until now. For some reason now their little yells have been triggering me for months, and badly.

*I know you find their sounds cute.* I did too, wholeheartedly. I am now suffering. This is not an exaggeration. Imagine waking up and the thing you love now makes your nervous system explode. I've had my current  girls for years, I have had pigs my whole life, and I know how their little brains activate at the slightest hint of food, which is (was) a charm point.

* I've been giving them their veg on a delay (ie, chop veg, feed pigs 15 mins later) to reduce the association.
* I have a word I say when I give them veg to hype them up for it when I can be prepared for the sound. The two reactive ones recognize it and will yell when they hear it. Idk. I thought the enrichment or alternative target noise might help, but maybe it's prolonging my problem.
* I've tried giving them a stern little ""no"" out loud, and then not giving them something when/where they expect it. Believe it or not this actually works, but only until I start chopping again.
* I can't move the cage further from the kitchen.
* I've tried white noise or turning on the coffee grinder (their veg detection is too powerful, and I can still hear them).

*I am not looking for advice on reducing my own reactivity unless you also have an auditory processing disorder* (for example please don't suggest headphones/earplugs unless you have a brand recommendation from personal experience). I'm still looking at people reactivity elsewhere, but I came to r/guineapig for pig help.

I am doing what I can with this (non plastic produce bags, above methods, about to start prepping food in my bedroom) but it's starting to be a serious problem. I just wound up in tears hiding in the bathroom after chopping half a cabbage.

If anyone has recommendations on how to make them react less to food sounds, please share.

Evening Snack - Cheese & Biscuits (5 crackers)

This was a ""dirty"" fast. I had 2-3 cups of coffee a day, mostly with a bit of milk. Two times, I had coffees with cream. I had electrolytes in my water, and one bottle of 100% coconut water. I was active throughout--working full days, walking my dog, traveling, and even moved flat (up and down 5 floors, no lift!)

Im 37F, 5'8 86kg. Ive been fasting for years. For the past years, im 90% OMAD, but also I've done a 14day fast, several 5/7/9 day fasts, months straight of adf, rolling 72s, etc. I seem to only lose weight if I go extreme-- i.e. rolling, multi-day dry fasts, but this feels stressful on my body and mind.

Ive taken breaks to give my body a rest, but want to live a fasting centered lifestyle, because I believe in the health benefits. It would just be nice if I also experienced weight loss.

So I have a rather unusual sleeping pattern which means I'm generally awake at ungodly hours of night. The typical 4am gym session has been replaced with 2am sessions and a quick nap before work. Figured I'd give this a shot and see how it goes. A bit about me:

* I work mostly remote as an engineer so I'm pretty much always available to talk!
* I'm fluent in Japanese and currently studying 2 other languages
* I did a PhD for a bit of banter
* I enjoy a good coffee, nice food and can cook a variety of cuisines

I can be a little dense sometimes so I prefer a more direct method of communication. I'm a very mellow character and have been told my presence can feel relaxing.

As for what I'm looking for. Around my age (26-32), consistent communication and hopefully you have a few hobbies of your own.

But I just don’t get it. 

I start to overthink all of it and it affects my self esteem quite a bit. Did I say something wrong? Am I not physically attractive enough, will I ever find a gf?

Most people, I think, genuinely overlook the importance of their appliances, especially refrigerators. In my home, my refrigerator isn’t just an appliance - it’s a moving picture of daily life and a symbol of comfort. The most defining characteristics of my fridge include its silver, metallic outside, the plastic shelves, and the ever-changing contents.

The silver metallic exterior lines the outside of my fridge, giving the fridge a shiny, glowy appearance. The metallic exterior is lined with family photos, important papers like bills and my siblings' report cards, some art projects from years of VBS my sister and I created, and several magnets from trips my family took.

Every shelf of my fridge has big, clear glass panels with white plastic edges that are stained from the years of spills. Perched on the top shelf is a jumble of condiments, half-empty leftovers, and forgotten expired foods. Some of the containers are so old that their labels have faded and/or curled at the edges due to the consequences of time. The air around them carries a sour, musty scent. A red box of puff pastry, a white tub of thick, stinky yogurt, a dish of fire-roasted tomatoes, and a small container of tan evaporated milk sit like relics of abandoned ingredients. Nestled beside them is a large container of juicy, meaty pot roast that has a garlicky,warm, meaty smell - a flavorful dinner paradise - and a medium-sized container of moist, crumbly cornbread that smells slightly sweet and doughy, leftovers, two of my family’s favorite meals.

Beneath it, the middle level mirrors the top but includes a pull-out drawer for cheese and deli meats on the left side. On that shelf sits a tall, clear container of cooked, sliced, soft orange carrots seasoned with butter and seasonings, a Cool Whip tub filled with creamy, bright orange mac 'n' cheese - my dad’s personal favorite side that is always stored in a reused container, and a clear container of peppery white mashed potatoes - another favorite of my father’s. On the right-hand side, a red-lidded container of thick, tasty garlic hummus and a green-lidded container of sour, crumbly feta cheese add a Mediterranean flair to my fridge, which is my personal favorite cuisine. Inside the meat and deli drawer are several slices of tangy, orange sharp cheddar cheese, white creamy spicy slices of pepperjack cheese, a package of smoky, bold kielbasa sausage, and a bag of homemade salty baked chicken wings.

The bottom shelf has two clear pull-out drawers for fruit and vegetables. On this shelf, there are three teal styrofoam cartons, each cradling a dozen and a half white eggs each which we always keep stocked because my family loves eggs. A tall green container of sour, curdled buttermilk sits beside a pitcher of strong, dark coffee that my mother requires and uses daily, and a bottle of thick sticky pancake syrup. A few large half-gallon glass containers of canned tomatoes, canned by my grandmother, line the back of the fridge. In the vegetable drawer, fresh, crunchy orange carrots and green, plain celery await their turn to be used in a soup for the fall season. In the fruit drawer, a large container of artificially colored, creamy potato salad gives off a faint chemical smell and taste, and a smaller container of cold, mayonnaise-heavy macaroni salad lurks at the bottom - my dad’s the only one who eats it.

​

The fridge door is lined with four clear rectangular bins, a longer bottom shelf, and a butter drawer with a clear plastic shield. On the bottom shelf, there are some jars of runny, vinegary deli mustard, thick dark green pickles, cans of my dad's Coca-Cola and Sprite sodas, alongside cans of my mom’s Bubbly refreshing sparkling water. The bins contain a small, clear glass jar of bitter green capers, spicy red thick chipotles in adobo, and vinegary pickled red onion. Other condiments include thick white avocado mayo, sour, thick red ketchup, vinegary mustard, dark, salty soy sauce, and sweet chocolate syrup. In the butter drawer, creamy, salty butter, thick margarine, a block of rich cream cheese, and a small jar of yeast sit ready for my baking business.

In many ways, my refrigerator is more than just a household appliance—it is a reflection of my family’s habits, memories, and unique tastes. Each shelf and bin tells a story, from favorite meals to family traditions and everyday routines. Looking at its contents, I am reminded that the fridge is not just about what we eat, but about the comfort, connection, and history I share with my family. It truly is the heart of my home.

I run a Shopify store and got frustrated with content creation. Generic AI tools don't know my products, and writing product-integrated blog posts manually takes hours.

**What I'm building:**

An AI tool that connects to your Shopify store and generates blog posts that actually feature your products.

**How it works:**

1. OAuth connection to your Shopify store (secure, read-only)
2. AI analyzes your product catalog
3. You pick a topic (or AI suggests based on your products)
4. Get a complete, SEO-optimized blog post with your products naturally integrated

**Example:**

* You sell coffee makers
* Topic: ""How to Make the Perfect Morning Coffee""
* Result: A blog post that naturally mentions your French press, espresso machine, and coffee beans throughout

**Why I think this is different:**

* Most AI tools are generic (don't know what you sell)
* Most product descriptions are boring (not SEO content)
* This bridges the gap: SEO content + product integration

**What I need from you:**

* Is this actually useful or am I solving a non-problem?
* What would make you actually use this vs ChatGPT + manual editing?
* Any features you'd need for this to be worth it?

Be honest. I'd rather hear ""this is stupid"" now than waste months building something nobody wants.

1ono8wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ono8wp/i_was_basically_fired_for_being_disabled_and_not/,I was basically fired for being disabled and not working fast enough. Im only 18. What do I do?,"This was my first every job and I was really excited to work at a new coffee shop that just opened in my small town. Before I was hired I clearly stated I had health issues, I was disabled, had a major back surgery and *needed* accommodations. My boss promised she would do this for me. Well... I just started about 2 weeks ago and it's been a train wreck. Despite being in pain, I do my job to the best of my ability and I only sit down for 1-2 minutes when I need to. I was mostly on food prep so cooking food and doing other stuff like cleaning and restocking. I had a shift on Sunday (yesterday) where she suddenly pulled me outside and said ""You seem to be having a hard time today"" I replied ""my pain is pretty bad"" and she simply said ""im sending you home for today because you cant keep up with the other girls (my coworkers) so youre essentially stealing tips from them and it isnt fair. We will have a talk and reevaluate if this job is for you"" and I clocked out and went home. We'll I woke up Monday morning (today) to see that she had removed me from all our work group chats, my work scheduling app, everything. She never texted, called, emailed or *ANYTHING* to confirm I was fired. Then today she posted that she was looking for new employees who can work faster and more efficiently. She has said really hurtful and insensitive things about my disability before so I sort of felt like this was coming. She treats me differently than the other employees. I am really upset as this was my first job and I was SO excited to work as a barista and baker. I loved working there (except I obviously disliked my boss) and I loved my coworkers. Is there any way I can file for wrongful termination or anything similar since she never confirmed my unemployment and I'm disabled?? She also said she would take our tips and give them all to the other employees for that day if we were late to work.. isn't that illegal?? Is there *anything* I can do to get some sort of compensation? I live in a really small town with almost no jobs that can actually accommodate me which is why I applied there in the first place... she promised me accommodations and equal opportunity and then fired me in less than 2 weeks!!!

I'm an indie dev who got tired of my own crappy sleep habits, so I made Sleep Forest. It's basically a sleep app that turns getting better rest into something fun by letting you grow a virtual forest. Hit your sleep goals each week, plant trees, unlock cool species, that kinda thing. No boring graphs, just watching your progress sprout up.

It helps with stuff like:

1. Knowing what to do for better sleep but sucking at sticking to it. The forest growth gives you that nudge to keep going without feeling like a chore.
2. Feeling like certain things mess with your sleep (late coffee? stress?) but not really nailing down why. It digs into your data to quantify what's actually throwing you off.
3. Building a routine that adapts over time. It looks at your past sleeps and tweaks suggestions, like shifting your wind-down or adding quick breathing stuff that worked before.

Takes about 1-2 weeks to get calibrated to you, then it starts giving real insights and maybe some changes if needed.Oh, and it's all phone-based right now, so great if you don't have an Apple Watch or anything. If folks end up liking it a ton, I'll look into adding HealthKit/Watch support down the line.

Normally premium's $9.99/month or $69.99/year (with a quick 3-day trial), but I'm unlocking lifetime access for free for the first 5000 people. No tricks, just download and sign up.

# The AI Agency Automation Chaos Phase

Before AI agency automation, I ran my SEO agency manually.

Everything myself.

Posting on Twitter manually.

Creating videos manually.

Managing team manually.

Managing sales manually.

It was painful.

Constant interruptions.

Chaotic workflows.

Drained energy and productivity.

I had a friend running an agency.

Friday night, we all went out.

Eight of us.

He had to go back and record five videos until early morning.

He was exhausted.

Burned out.

Couldn't do them earlier because no energy or time.

Why? Manual processes and chaos.

AI agency automation fixes this.

# AI Agency Automation Journey

Two and a half years ago, nobody knew me.

Pre-ChatGPT.

Nobody knew I sold SEO.

SEOs would come up and forget my name.

No status in the industry.

Today I'm one of the biggest names in SEO.

The difference? AI agency automation.

First AI agency automation I built was a game changer.

Transformed business overnight.

# The 3 Phases of AI Agency Automation

Works weekends.

Works all day and night.

No sleep.

No coffee.

No complaints.

No pay rises.

Creates better videos than me.

Better content quality.

Better editing.

Better B-roll.

Better filming.

Better scripting.

My AI agency automation generates 100-300 new leads per day.

I read somewhere "" if you miss me, tell me, don't invade my dreams""

I have been invaded. 

Dreams that I shouldn't have. 
About someone I shouldn't dream of while sleeping next to the one I should dream of...the one the government has given permission to invade my dreams. 

But no. As luck would have it, my dreams are of he who should not be named. Our Lord Voldemort as he shall be known forthwith seeing that I can neither say his name nor mention my thoughts on him. 

And I wish I could tell him so,
Tell him that when I am away from his space for a day or two, he should just call. 

Or write an email.

Ping me on Teams; 
Give a random update or ask, on anything..like should we add more cups to the afternoon coffee tray

..or maybe even write and delete on WhatsApp, send a meme..heck..go to Instagram or something..anything...

Just stop infiltrating my dreams.
 
Stealing the staring role. 

Auditioning for an Oscar with stellar moves...Aii. It seems intentional. 

For there, he looks at me the way he cannot in  the presence of others. 

He whispers in my ear...that low low husky voice.
He nibbles and licks, telling me all those little thoughts he has when I'm doing a presentation, how he likes how I lick my lips when I'm nervous. How he knows I'm about to spill some bullshit when I touch the nape of my neck.

In these dreams, he gets to look deeply into my eyes like he never can and tells me how lovely brown they are, in them he reads everything I can't say and yet still asks me what I do want.

In our dream  he thinks I'm funny, falling over at my jokes and adores my quirky self.

 In here he doesn't have to perform for anyone else but me. His mask is off and I can see him...

He lets his metaphoric hair down and stays loose, his shirt unbuttoned, his swimmer chest a  feast for my eyes and he doesn't mind.

Here we take our time...we talk softly about how much he moves me when he strides around every few minutes...compare our ADHD notes wonder at each other's weirdities.

I just started about 2 weeks ago and it's been a train wreck. Despite being in pain, I do my job to the best of my ability and I only sit down for 1-2 minutes when I need to. I was mostly on food prep so cooking food and doing other stuff like cleaning and restocking. I had a shift on Sunday (yesterday) where she suddenly pulled me outside and said ""You seem to be having a hard time today"" I replied ""my pain is pretty bad"" and she simply said ""im sending you home for today because you cant keep up with the other girls (my coworkers) so youre essentially stealing tips from them and it isnt fair. We will have a talk and reevaluate if this job is for you"" and I clocked out and went home. We'll I woke up Monday morning (today) to see that she had removed me from all our work group chats, my work scheduling app, everything. She never texted, called, emailed or *ANYTHING* to confirm I was fired. Then today she posted that she was looking for new employees who can work faster and more efficiently. She has said really hurtful and insensitive things about my disability before so I sort of felt like this was coming. She treats me differently than the other employees. I am really upset as this was my first job and I was SO excited to work as a barista and baker. I loved working there (except I obviously disliked my boss) and I loved my coworkers. Is there any way I can file for wrongful termination or anything similar since she never confirmed my unemployment and I'm disabled??

My RLS is much worse on days I work out and I am wondering why. If it is the caffine, the workout or being tired.

Got to a 5.15am cross fit class. 

Go to bed around 9.30pm. I have bad restless legs around bed time and also 2am if I don’t take my medicine.

What I missed was my ""AM Accerlerator Shake"", made famous by Dr DH Kiefer's ""Carb Backloading"" diet. It's essentially a spin on Bulletproof Coffee, where I mix 150ml of organic almond milk with half a scoop of whey protein, a tablespoon of MCT oil, coffee and hot water.

I absolutely love this shake, and while I appreciate it's not carnivore friendly, it's keto friendly as it maintains and contributes to ketosis. Yes I'm aware some of the ingredients may cause unnoticeable or mild inflammation but it's a tradeoff I'm willing to take given how much I love starting my mornings with it.

Additionally, I'll allow myself a carb meal once every 1-2 weeks in order to stay metabolically flexible. Again, in a perfect world this wouldn't need to be done, but being realistic, there will be a time in the future where carbs are ingested (holidays, birthdays or family events – food is massive in my culture). And I found that by being so strict for a long time, I suffered the consequences majorly when breaking carnivore. So a weekly/bi-weekly carb meal allows me to stay metabolically flexible with a varied gut microbiome and attend planned socials, all while staying in ketosis most of the time and benefitting from carnivore at least 70-80% of the time.

That all said, I'd love to know if anyone here also has their ""allowances"" while maintaining a predominantly carnivorous diet. Please share!",3,1762203291.0,carnivorediet,11,0.71,False

I got a tasting set that had six flavors, and rhey were all wrapped in these really small chocolate bars that were about three and a half inches long by one and a half inches wide. they also had a slab of chocolate the size of a cutting board, but it had cuts in it like a normal chocolate bar. Someone told me the slab was 3D printed chocolate...

""Egyptian Chocolate"": the chocolate was an orange-brown color, and tasted more like butter than anything else. It had thin a coating like toffee with a hint of citrus, and had a nice crunch. I woke up salivating after eating this one.

""Uncle Joe"": This one looked like a piece of milk chocolate but it had undertones of coffee and root beer. I remember one of the employees saying that they made it specially for me, but they named it after my uncle for some reason.

""English White"" It was white chocolate, but it looked like one of those cold-pressed soap bars and was quite soft and a little chewy. Tasted mainly like vanilla bean and a little buttery.

""Red Chocolate"" This one tasted like normal dark chocolate, but kinda spicy. It was a dark red in color.

""Blue Pearl"" This one was a dark blue with gold flecks, and had a flavor of tea mixed with dark chocolate. It was also quite soft but less chewy than the white chocolate one. I think my brain automatically thought of a flavor of macarons from a certain bakery I like to go to called Bottega Louie.

There was also this green one called ""Springy"". I never tasted it, but it looked like inside-out Dubai chocolate in that it was a primarily green piece of chocolate.

He never directly said he likes me, but his behavior felt like interest. Recently he started talking about marriage, told me he got engaged before briefly, and then said he’s “seeing someone right now” and will tell me more when we meet for coffee face-to-face. I thought he was hinting at me.

Then this weekend he went to a youth conference where one of my friends saw him. She told me he was constantly sitting with a girl he just met there, and the two of them even went to talk to a priest together after the conference, like they were exploring something serious.

Since he came back, he stopped liking my stories and hasn’t messaged me.

Now I feel confused.
Was he just dating multiple girls at the same time?
Was I just one of his “options” while he was deciding?
Or maybe he never meant me at all when he said he’s seeing someone?

I wasn’t emotionally attached but I feel a bit disappointed. It feels like modern dating has turned into men auditioning women for their approval and I really hate that vibe.

I really enjoy following you and I never thought I would have an interesting story to share, but here I am. :)) 
Apologies in advance, this one’s a long one!

I want to start by saying that I saw her as a sister — I truly couldn’t imagine my life without her in it, or mine without being part of hers.
I believed we had one of the strongest bonds; we could understand each other just by a look, finish each other’s sentences, and often had the same reactions or answers to things.

I (28 f) just had my birthday this weekend and celebrated it in another country with my boyfriend (31 m), my ex-best friend of 21 years (28 f) and her husband (28 m). 
Initially, it was meant to be a trip for just the two of us, but to my surprise, they were waiting for us at the airport — and I was honestly thrilled (tes, my boyfriend knew about it).

The first day was absolutely wonderful.
We arrived in the capital, had brunch, strolled around the city, and at sunset my boyfriend had arranged a romantic dinner — where he proposed. 💍
Everything went perfectly.

The only thing that caught our attention was when my boyfriend (F) mentioned to my ex bf (I) one of the activities from the list he had prepared and sent her beforehand.
Her response was, “Who do you think even looked at what you sent me?”
We both chose to let it go and didn’t say anything, assuming that since they had already been there twice, they probably felt confident about knowing what to do.

That evening, we planned the next day’s schedule — where to go, what time to leave, everything (all of it decided by her - mostly).

The next morning, my boyfriend and I were ready at the time she had set, but she wasn’t. I was a bit annoyed but didn’t say anything, though it probably showed in my attitude. Later, after things settled, I told her that I was upset in the morning, and she admitted she expected that reaction since she was the one who set the time and then wasn’t ready herself.
Still following her plan, we arrived at the location for the activity she had chosen.
However, the original company she had in mind didn’t have any availability, so the lady there managed to arrange it for us through another company (a detail that turned out to be important later on, I promise)

The day ended well, and for the following day, we planned something more relaxed.

The next morning, we woke up later, went for coffee, relaxed a bit, and then headed to the harbor to rent a boat to go to an island. When we arrived, we realized the boats had already left.
Basically, it was already the second time she was super confident that we would do something, but she wasn't really prepared. 

To be honest, I hadn’t really wanted to go there anyway — I had mentioned that in the morning, though not firmly.

Eventually, we decided to buy tickets from a man at the harbor, who claimed he could get us there by boat. I wasn’t sure he was being honest and asked him several questions, but in the end, we decided to buy the tickets.
When it came to payment, my boyfriend tried first and made a mistake; then I tried and made the same one. He got a bit frustrated and reacted in a way I didn’t like — I told him so.

At that moment, my ex bf suddenly jumped into our conversation and snapped at me, saying I didn’t know how to enjoy anything and that she didn’t understand my attitude.
I told her she had no reason to interfere in my discussion with F and that she should mind her own business — because I wasn’t arguing with her in the first place.

She got angry and started walking ahead of us. When we all met up again, it turned out I had been right about the man selling the tickets — we weren’t taking a boat, but a bus to another location. Something we could have done ourselves and would have cost us less than half of what we paid.

At that point, I didn’t want to go anymore, since I didn’t think it was worth the money.
But in the end, I agreed to go because my boyfriend really wanted to. 

After we got on the bus, she kept criticizing me, saying that I should just go with the flow and appreciate the fact that she had planned and organized this vacation. 
Really?! The only thing that was actually well organized and went according to plan was the dinner arranged by F.

I kept insisting that I didn’t understand why we were even having this conversation, since the two comments exchanged between F and I had nothing to do with her — and I had never interfered in her conversations with her husband, M.

She kept telling me that I was ruining the trip and didn’t know how to enjoy life.
I told her she was actually the one ruining my vacation.

After that, I decided that for next summer’s trip (which we’d already planned together), I’d have to find separate accommodation because it was clear we couldn’t travel together again. I even started checking on Booking.

Then she told me I should find somewhere else to sleep that very night — which I found extremely inappropriate and out of line.
After things calmed down a bit, I told her that she should apologize, but she said she had nothing to apologize for.

When we got off the bus, we didn’t speak anymore. She bought us upgraded tickets for the ferry, and later we rented a small boat to explore the island — she came along too.
On the island, communication was minimal. My goal was to get back to the apartment so we could talk things through like adults.
If she didn’t see a problem with what she’d done, I was ready to pack and leave.
But if she apologized, I was willing to move on and keep our friendship.

Later that day, as we passed by the restaurant where we were supposed to have dinner, her husband asked if we wanted to move the reservation outdoors. I didn’t answer — I first wanted to talk things through. She noticed that I didn’t respond, walked past us again, and went ahead.

Not long after, her husband called to tell me that they had booked a different place to stay. I told him that they shouldn’t have been the ones to move out, because she was the one who had kicked us out.
Later she told me she only kicked me out because her husband saw me looking for another place on Booking and told her about it. 

When they came back to the apartment, she started yelling at me, bringing up things I had never heard before — accusations out of nowhere.
I asked if she really wasn’t going to apologize, and she said she had nothing to be sorry for and that our friendship was over, claiming she had “put up with me for too long"", ""you are ticking bomb"" etc. 
I was in complete shock, because she had never said anything like that before, and honestly, I’ve never had anything to reproach her for.

At one point, while I was in their room trying to talk, she suddenly tried to storm out — and instead of asking me politely to move, she shoved past me.
I told her that if she couldn’t behave respectfully, she could just leave faster.

After that, we all went our separate ways.
This happened yesterday, and this morning we flew back home.

Now I just feel really sad and unsure — wondering if I should have handled things differently or if I actually did the right thing.
I’m generally a firm person and I value respect deeply, but with her, I think I’ve always been the one to compromise and put her needs before mine.
And thinking about it now, I realize she would never have done something like this with any of her other friends.

I’ve been prescribed 30mg for my titration period, I was incredible nervous taking the medication today, more so with the AF and taking Elvanse. 

I have to say I have felt no different, I’ve had the headaches (although, I have given up coffee following orders) and a dry mouth but my brain has still felt chaotic and if anything I have been less focused at work. 

Appreciate this is only day one and the dose may change after a few weeks, I just wondered how other peoples first day went and will positive results show over time?  

Let’s hope so - I miss caffeine!! Your thoughts and experiences are must appreciated. ",1,1762202927.0,Elvanse,0,0.99,False

A realistic café where the coffee begins to serve itself. Cups slide smoothly across tables, milk pours mid-air in slow motion. The camera moves through the scene as everything happens with impossible precision — like the café itself has come to life.

a breathtaking, hyper-realistic underwater chase captured by a sleek autonomous submersible darting through the twilight depths of a bioluminescent ocean trench. the camera glides past cathedrals of coral and swirling constellations of glowing plankton, weaving between towering hydrothermal vents that billow shimmering sapphire and violet minerals. schools of translucent fish scatter in rippling waves as the submersible barrels forward, its lights cutting through the ink-black water. a colossal manta-like creature materializes from the abyss, its fins trailing nebulae of luminescent spores. the submersible spirals downward after it, sand and shell fragments whipping past as a thermal current pulls them into a canyon of jagged rock. electric eels arc streaks of light across the darkness, illuminating ancient carvings etched into the trench walls. for a moment, everything slows — the creature glides through a cathedral-like chamber, its bioluminescence mirrored in the sub’s curved lens — before it bursts upward, the camera following through a column of rising bubbles. they breach the surface beneath a star-streaked sky, the ocean glowing beneath like a galaxy unfolding in liquid form.

I’ve been trying some coffees from The Matter of Concrete and I’m a bit surprised by how they taste. Even after resting them for 3–4 weeks, I keep getting a really roasty, bitter, and harsh finish — almost like a solid medium roast. Very very roasty.  

I’ve been brewing according to their recipe guide, dialing in carefully, and still can’t seem to get that clean, juicy, “Nordic light roast” profile I was expecting.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with their coffees? Or is it just me (maybe my water, grind, or expectations)?

Thought I’d come back and post another fun custom story that I did recently.

If you too would like to commission a custom then go ahead and DM your request so we bring that fantasy of yours to life! 

It was another sunny, cloudless day in Houston, Texas as the weekend drew nearer. Friday had finally arrived, bringing along with it a heat advisory, warning citizens of the potential impact brought forth by the scorching weather. Though that didn’t seem to stop the daily busy compute from workers and travelers alike.

One of which being 23-year old Marcus Stanley, a recent graduate of Texas Tech and now an entry level marketing coordinator. It was a job Marcus took a great deal of enjoyment in working as today was a day like any other, which saw him walking out of the sprawling glass doors of the building with a smile on his face, thankful for the opportunity to continue doing what he loved. He whipped out his key from his right pocket and pressed the unlock button, triggering a loud blinging noise from his 2023 Nissan Altima. He then slid into his car, started his engine with a grunting roar, and was on his way to his long awaited lunch break. Marcus rode into the bright sun, joining the other several thousand Houston commuters who were also continuing their daily routines. 

Marcus’ drive to his favorite eating spot, Whataburger, was one that consisted of many starting and stopping lights, a ton of traffic, and perhaps maybe one or two expletives directed at a couple of rage inducing drivers. Thankfully, the speaker busting music blaring throughout his car made the ride just a little more tolerable until he finally pulled into the Whataburger parking lot. 

Marcus parked the Nissan under a shady tree and hopped out of the vehicle before making his way towards the restaurant building. He opened the door, stepped inside, and was immediately met by the breezy, cooling sensation known as Whataburger air conditioning. Marcus patted around the upper part of his dress shirt for perspiration stains as he proceeded to find his place in line. As he looked up in the direction of the menu, he saw something, or more like someone. Someone who, just by a gaze at their back view, looked very familiar. Standing just one person ahead of him, was the cinnamon brown hair in a puffy bun, the bronze tanned skin, not to mention the obvious navy blue police uniform. To Marcus, this looked eerily similar to a special young lady who had the pleasure of sharing a rather unforgettable experience with several months ago. Could it be? He just had to ask, it was eating him up inside. He carefully walked toward the woman, stepped beside her, and tapped her on the shoulder. As soon as she turned around, meeting her eyes at Marcus’, it became clear as day. It was in fact HER. Officer Annalise Martinez. Not long before Marcus graduated from college, he was privileged enough to receive his first fart session from the breathtaking policewoman. But did she keep Marcus saved in her memory file the same way he had with her? 

“Hey, you remember me?” Marcus uttered wearing a wide, friendly grin

Marcus seeing the teeth-baring smile begin to appear on Officer Martinez’s face was a good sign 

“Oh, hey! How are you?”
Upon hearing Officer Martinez’s greeting, Marcus began to think aloud to himself. 
“I mean, she looks happy to see me…but then again she’s probably just trying to be nice”.  

“I’m great, thank you, just here for the same reason everyone else is”, Marcus replied, quickly proceeding to turn on the charm while standing in the presence of his secret crush 

“Oh, to stay outta the heat?” Officer Martinez quipped back

“Well that too, that too”, replied Marcus as he and the officer shared a brief laugh 

“Well it’s nice to see you, I’m surprised you recognized me”, said Officer Martinez still flashing that toothy smile 

“I mean, how could I forget you…”, Marcus replied, purposely letting that one settle in the air without any follow up only to later regret saying it in the first place
“Damn, was that too much?” Marcus thought to himself 

Officer Martinez smiled and let out a quiet chuckle before facing forward 

Marcus still wondered if Officer Martinez even remembered who he was. He still looked the same, the mini fro, the glasses, the minimal facial hair, not much had changed. She hadn’t said his name but yet, he hadn’t said her’s either. He noticed that Officer Martinez was facing forward, looking towards the cashier’s counter. Perhaps he was just a random stranger to her after all. She remained silent after the “how could I forget you” comment, maybe she had no idea what that could’ve been in reference too. Now to Marcus, it was appearing as though he had been coming off as this weird guy who wouldn’t return to his spot in line. He decided that rather than awkwardly back away and forget about catching up with Officer Martinez, he’d make another go at it. 

“Y’know I’m surprised I don’t see you more often around these parts”, Marcus said as he whipped out his phone in an attempt to not appear as though this conversation was the only meaningful thing happening in his life 

Officer Martinez, swung her head back around, once again making eye contact with Marcus.
“Oh yeah actually, I had been transferred over to Beaumont PD just temporarily. They had an Officer shortage and I was just there to fill a position until they could hire more guys. So now I’m back with Houston PD and that’s been for the last…let’s see…three weeks? Yeah, I’ve been back for about two or three weeks. So much happens on the job you tend to forget what day it is”, Officer Martinez laughed following her explanation of her absence from the city. Marcus laughed along with her as he began to reply back 

“Well it’s great to have you back, your service means a whole lot to this city and if you don’t hear that from anyone else, at least you heard it from me.”

Officer Martinez responded to Marcus’ kind words with her signature smile
“That really means a lot, thank you”. 

Before Marcus could think of another line to say, his train of thought was interrupted by one of the workers behind the counter

“If we could please try and keep the line in a single file, everyone, that would be great. Just so that no one gets confused. Thank y’all so much”…

Marcus looked back to see the crowd of people gathering behind him. He then returned his attention to the worker behind the counter who noticed the confused expression on his face and nodded her head

“Um..I’m just here for a pickup, do I have to get in the same line as the people who are trying to order or? …” Marcus asked

“Oh, you’re here for a pickup, okay. What was your name?”

“Marcus”…

The worker wrote something down on a piece of paper before taking it to one of her co-workers. Moments later she returned to the counter. 

“Okay, we got you, your order should be ready soon…and is anyone else here for a pickup…ma’am?”, the worker directed her attention towards Officer Martinez 

“Yeah, same, pickup”, Officer Martinez responded 

Marcus remained standing beside Officer Martinez, hoping to continue their conversation 
“So what’s your order of choice here”, the young man asked to the officer 

“Oooh, so I love the Jalapeño and cheese Whataburger cause it lets me get an extra side of Jalapeño and an extra side of cheese. I get a separate order of fries and top it with the Jalapeño AND the cheese and if I’m not at work, I grab some Tapatio from out the fridge and just lather it on there, it’s SO yummy, oh my gosh.”

Marcus nodded his head with a smile, observing how this was the most enthusiastic Officer Martinez had been the entire time. 

“That sounds like a Diddy party in your mouth…that’s a wild combo, I can’t lie”, joked Marcus 

Officer Martinez belted out a big laugh before she went on to defend her choice in food toppings
“Hey, it’s better than you’d expect. Don’t knock it till you try it. I’ll take that over plain ol, salty, boring, butt ass naked French fries I’ll tell you that”.

“What!? Plain fries are where it’s at, now you just sound crazy”, Marcus playfully replied 

“Where is it at? Where? Tell me? For me it’s at the bottom of the garbage where they belong”, retorted Officer Martinez 

“Are you forreal?” Marcus scoffed 

“Yup, if it ain’t got no Jalapeño, no queso, no salsa, no guacamole, no Tapatio, no Chili con carne, I don’t want no parts of it. I’m good”, Officer Martinez confidently boasted 

Marcus got a little turned on by the way Officer Martinez rolled her “r’s” throughout that sentence, now with the Officer opening up more, he found his attraction for her increasing. And there wasn’t anything Marcus loved more than a woman who knew what she wanted in the food department and made no apologies for it. 

“You see, you got it all wrong, you got it all twisted”, Marcus began, “There’s nothing more delicious than getting to taste that freshly cooked, warm crispy potato with the dabs of salt and the glistening grease, you just get to savor that flavor…”

“What flavor?!” Officer Martinez interrupted, “What flavor?!”

“There’s plenty of flavor!” defended Marcus

“Where? Show me? Otherwise it’s just boring, butt ass naked fries. Ugh, just saying it, grossed me out”…

Before Marcus could come back with a retort, he heard the call of Officer Martinez’s name and watched her make her way up to the counter. Marcus looked on as the wondrous sight of Officer Martinez’s plump butt sitting tight and compact in her police uniform filled his eyes with a hint of lust. A few seconds later he was snapped out of his trance at the sound of his name being called as well. He stepped up to the front counter, meeting Officer Martinez who was still gathering her order

“Just making sure everything is there, don’t wanna have to come back here, chewing somebody’s ass out”, Officer Martinez muttered under her breath as she proceeded to peer into her two bags of food that sat atop the counter 

Marcus emitted a light chuckle as he picked up his bag and grabbed a handful of extra napkins
“Trust me, I’m sure they remembered your Jalapeños and your queso”, Marcus jested as he imitated Officer Martinez’s accented r-rolling. 

Officer Martinez laughed and playfully rolled her eyes
“Whatever, Marcus, you enjoy your boring, plain, butt ass naked fries…ugh, that’s so nasty”, Officer Martinez jokingly responded 

“She said my name”, was the first thought to pop into Marcus’ head followed by the prospect of him “shooting his shot” at the officer and potentially not going brick. It was a scenario that he hadn’t yet weighed the pro’s and con’s of, but for some reason felt it was at least worthy of taking a risk. Marcus walked alongside Officer Martinez as they headed for the door which he opened for her and proceeded to join the officer outside. The entire time he was blueprinting his strategy to win the beauty in uniform over. 

“Every time I step outside man I ain’t never ready for that heat”, said Marcus as walked beside Officer Martinez out onto the restaurant entrance

“Oh my gosh, are you kidding? It’s crazy. At least you don’t have to wear this hot freakin uniform all day, my ass hasn’t stopped sweating since 11:00 this morning.” Officer Martinez said as she tucked one of her bags under her armpit. 

Marcus briefly froze upon hearing that rather honest admission from the officer. He could already feel the front of his dress pants grow tighter as the vivid image of Officer Martinez’s sweaty, glistening bare ass spreading over a porcelain throne during a random bathroom break began to swarm his head. 

Marcus had a somewhat suggestive comment appear in his mind, though he hesitated on actually verbalizing it to Officer Martinez, before finally deciding to take the risk. 

“How many times you gotta say the word ass before you remember that not too long ago my face was like two inches away from it?” Marcus asked the officer in jest 

Officer Martinez began to crack a smile that grew wider and wider before she finally bursted out in laughter 
“Okay, okay”, Officer Martinez attempted to catch her breath and calm her laughter
“So I remember exactly what you’re talking about, but I just didn’t want to reference it so publicly…” Officer Martinez said, lowering her head and raising her brows as she stared at Marcus 

Marcus stood there in thought for a moment
“Ohhh..gotcha, gotcha, gotcha..yeah I didn’t even…yeah”, Marcus caught on to what Officer Martinez was subtlety implying as he nodded his head and smiled

“Yeah…”, replied the officer 

“That’s my fault, I didn’t even realize it, I was just trying to get you to remember me”, explained Marcus

“Oh I remember you but I was also like shut up, shut up, shut up”, Officer Martinez joked before laughing 

“Yeah, I almost said too much, huh”, replied Marcus

“Almost, I was waiting for you to actually be like, hey so remember when we were in your car and you started farting in my face?” Officer Martinez joked as she imitated Marcus’ deep tone of voice  

Marcus laughed as he stuffed his napkins into his bag
“I mean, that’s also the only experience of you I have to go off of, so”…

Marcus walked with Officer Martinez to her police cruiser. She stepped over to the driver’s side, placing her bags atop the hood before leaning over it with her arms folded. Marcus did the same while on the opposite of the cruiser. 

“Yeah, that’s true…”, Officer Martinez replied with somewhat of a pause 

“But, y’know, who’s to say we can’t have more experiences with each other”, Marcus started to take advantage of the sudden direction the conversation had taken, he was really going to do it, he was going see to it that he slam dunked this shot attempt

Officer Martinez smiled and emitted a silent chuckle 
“Did someone say that?…”

Marcus stood across from Officer Martinez, with her cruiser the only thing sitting in between them, knowing that he was gonna have to do a little prodding, a little pushing, to get this proverbial wagon over the hill. However he couldn’t help but be somewhat amused by the way Officer Martinez seemed to be playing this.

“No but…it hasn’t happened yet”, replied Marcus 

Officer Martinez stared at him, wearing a bit of a smirk. She simply opened her palms and shrugged her shoulders 
“You haven’t said anything…”

Marcus let out a breathy chuckle before briefly looking off to the side with a smile. He then locked eyes with Officer Martinez
“So may I say something?”

Officer Martinez once again flashed a subtle smirk as she pressed the tip of her tongue into the bottom of her mouth 
“Hopefully before we both catch on fire”, quipped the officer, referring to the stifling heat she and Marcus had been standing under

“Alright…would it be possible for us to perhaps spend a little time together, hang out, talk. Just a friendly little meet up”, Marcus made it a point to sound as genuine and sincere as he could while exuding an obvious amount of confidence, though he was shaking at the potential idea of his shot being forcibly swatted away into the stands. 

Officer Martinez kept her eyes focused on Marcus’, she smiled and bit her bottom lip before finally giving her anticipated answer
“You know…I think we could do that…sure”

On the outside Marcus was wearing a kind smile while assuming a casual sense of composure, but on the inside, he did a dance routine on top of the police cruiser as if he was cosplaying Usher. 

“Okay, sounds like a plan then”, Marcus casually replied 

“I mean…we haven’t exactly planned anything though”, replied Officer Martinez 

“What do you mean?” asked Marcus with a bit of confusion 

Officer Martinez rolled her eyes and exhaled through a smile
“Okay, look, it’s hot as balls out here alright and my lunch break is bout to be over in like 15 minutes. You gonna get in this car and figure out what I mean or you wanna find me at the police station tomorrow?”

Marcus quickly registered the straightforward disposition of Officer Martinez 
“How about I go ahead and get in the car”

Officer Martinez shook her head and smiled as she unlocked the cruiser with the press of a key. She and Marcus grabbed their bags from atop the car and proceeded to slide into the vehicle. Upon shutting their doors, they settled in and continued the conversion while organizing their respective meals. 

“Been awhile since I’ve been in this thing, still looks the same”, commented Marcus in reference to the interior of Officer Martinez’s cruiser

“Well actually this is a new car, I received it when I came back to Houston PD”, corrected Officer Martinez as she began peeling the paper off of her burger
“But…one thing that has remained the same, I be rippin so much ass up in here”

Marcus laughed as he bit into a French fry, though his pants definitely grew a little tighter upon hearing that casually said remark.

“Not gonna lie, I was kinda expecting to get a whiff of a lil sum sum as soon as I got in”, joked Marcus 

Officer Martinez laughed before biting into her burger
“That’s so funny…I actually did rip a fart before I pulled up, but it only smelled a little”, said Officer Martinez with a mouth full of meat

“How interesting”, replied Marcus as he took a bite out of his cheeseburger 

“So…”, Officer Martinez began as she choked down her food
“Is the only reason you wanna hang out is so we can…do THAT again?”

Marcus paused, understanding that his answer to this question should be kept under careful consideration
“Nah, to be totally honest, other than that…I just really dig your vibe. Like your personality, your whole aura, it’s really unique”, explained Marcus as he went to take another bite of his burger. It wasn’t his best, but it filled in the blank. 

Officer Martinez smiled before taking a sip of her bottled water. She attempted a reply but started blushing instead which resulted in her chuckling while still trying to keep her composure.

“I’m serious, that’s from the heart”, said Marcus

Officer Martinez exhaled as she grabbed her plate of fries and began decorating them with her sides of Jalapeños and cheese 
“Well thank you, that’s really sweet of you to say” the officer said as she dumped the cups of condiments onto her potatoes 

Marcus scrunched his face as he watched Officer Martinez who looked up at him and simply rolled her eyes
“Whatever, man, i don’t care what you say. This shit about to HIT!” 

“Yeah it’s about to hit like Tyson right in your stomach”, Marcus jokingly replied 

“Pshh, ion care…ima be sittin on that toilet, giddy than a muthafucka!” Officer Martinez laughed as she took a bite out of her newly dressed fries 

Marcus sat in silence. That was now third reference that Officer Martinez had made to her digestive habits. Either she really gave little to no attention to the idea of “TMI” or that moment they shared all those months ago had effectively broken a barrier that still had yet to be re-erected. 

“Respectfully Annalise…you’re a psychopath”, Marcus said in jest as he and the officer shared a laugh 

“No I’m just free and that feels good as fuck, you know”, said the officer as she tore into her messy fries 

“Free as in?” questioned Marcus

“Free as in, the dude that I was with for five whole months is no longer breathing down my back, judging me and acting like my freakin dad”, replied the officer with full mouth 

“Wow, then to that I say, good riddance”, replied Marcus, taking a sip of his beverage 

“Damn straight”, said Officer Martinez as she proceeded to tuck into her burger

There was an air of silence that, along with the chomping of food, sat within the space between the two acquaintances that lasted for only a moment. It was clear something had noticeably triggered Officer Martinez. Still she proceeded to carry on

“And just so you know”, restarted the officer, “He wasn’t nearly as fascinated by my farts as you are”.

“You don’t say?”, replied Marcus somewhat sarcastically. He still remembered how utterly atrocious Officer Martinez’s farts were. Those fetid odors would somehow find their way back to him in the most random of moments almost on a regular basis 

“Nope…I was like a literal balloon, just holding in all that excess air. I would just be patiently waiting for him to leave the room or go to work or take a shit. Just so I could release a massive fart”, explained Officer Martinez as she took another sip of water
“Ugh, that relationship was so trash”

There was a part of Marcus that was a little envious that there existed a gentleman who once had Officer Martinez all to himself. Though a dueling side of him took pleasure in knowing that this individual never got a chance to sniff one of Officer Martinez’s rank farts. Marcus was one of one in that regard. 

“Welp, you know what they say…one man’s trash…” Marcus turned his head toward Officer Martinez and smiled, letting her finish the rest of the phrase in her head. The officer laughed and shook her head before digging back into her fries. 

“So I take it you’re single now”, asked Marcus, shoving a French fry into his mouth

Officer Martinez nodded her head, “Mm-hm”

Marcus nodded and folded his mouth

“And what about you, you…seeing anyone or were you seeing anyone?” Officer Martinez asked, as casually as she could 

Marcus smiled. “Nah”, he replied, “Not then, not now”…

“Or in my case, not ever”, the officer said somberly 

“What makes you say that”, asked Marcus

Officer Martinez shook her head and let out a long breath 
“That’s just my insecurity talking”

“I mean, talk to me, why do you believe you’re never gonna find someone?” asked Marcus in a sincere tone 

“Well let’s see I’m 36, no kids, no husband, no prospects, no ring in sight, and this time next year when I’m 37 nothing will have changed”, Officer Martinez ripped a bite out of her burger and chewed with authority 

Marcus felt sorry for the officer as he watched her sit with water forming across her eyelids. 

“And you can’t forget about my Catholic Mexican mother, every chance she gets going, Mija, when you are going to settle down, when are you going to give up that job and be a mother, it’s getting late”, the officer scoffed and rolled her eyes 
“As if a man is gonna fall from the clouds and get down on one knee, like no..”

Marcus sat in silence, ensuring he gave the officer all the venting space she needed. 

“Sorry…I shouldn’t-I shouldn’t be dumping all this on you”…

“No, you’re getting it all out, that’s good. You just need someone to talk to”, assured Marcus

“Yeah like a therapist”, the officer let out a sarcastic laugh as she took a sip of water

Marcus shrugged. “I’ll be your therapist..”

Officer Martinez chuckled as if to say “you’re so cute”

“Nah forreal, I’ll be your therapist, your psychiatrist, your shrink, and you can just talk and I’ll listen. I’m a good listener, plus I’m free”

The officer laughed. “No hidden pre session fees?” the officer joked

“Nope none of that and guess what, you’re even free to fart whenever you please”, jested Marcus 

This got a rather boisterous laugh from the officer 

“Okay, you got me, you’re hired”, quipped Martinez

“Aight cool but I can’t start till tomorrow cause Amazon ain’t send me my certificate yet”, Marcus replied jokingly 

Another loud laugh emitted from Officer Martinez

“Thank you…” said the officer 

“For what?” replied Marcus 

“For making laugh, I really needed it…” said the officer 

Marcus smiled as did Officer Martinez, the two then proceeded to trade flirtatious looks back and forth while continuing their meal

“What?” asked Marcus in response to Officer Martinez staring at him

“I’m waiting for you to finally say what you were gonna ask me out there”, replied the officer 

Marcus remembered that he hadn’t officially made the basket. There was a pending foul that needed rectifying. 

“Ah, yes, about that”, Marcus said as he laughed
“So…Annalise. As I stated previously, you’re a really cool young woman with a super unique and dope vibe, like I said I love your aura, your personality, and to top it all off, you are unbelievably gorgeous. I’d like to see more of you and if you’d like to see more of me, I’d greatly appreciate that. Maybe we can meet up for lunch or dinner or even a cup of coffee. Would you…happen to be free tomorrow?”

Officer Martinez smiled while hiding her face behind her hand, her cheeks displaying a rosy red glow. 

“Quick question”, the officer replied 

“Shoot”, replied Marcus 

“How old are you?”

“I’m 23”

Officer Martinez nodded, “You asked me out like a 23 year old”

Marcus leaned back into his seat while gripping his chest
“We just throwin out insults now? After I professed my feelings to you in such a heartfelt manner”

Officer Martinez laughed before taking her plate of fries and holding it out towards Marcus
“Here, this is for you”

Marcus looked down at the plate, the fries were slimy and gooey sitting in a pool of melted cheese and soggy jalapeños. He scrunched his face and shook his head 
“No it ain’t”

“Just try it, it’s good”, assured the officer 

“Nah, we don’t believe you, you need more people”, joked Marcus

“Marcus eat it, eat it or I’m not going out with you”, Annalise playfully threatened 

Marcus jerked his head back
“Oh-kay, so now cause I won’t eat your jeepers creepers fries, you’ve resorted to blackmail?”

“You are so stupid! Just eat the damn fries or I’ll make you!” Officer Martinez exclaimed trying to both suppress her laughter and incite intimidation 

“Aight so make me”, replied Marcus

Officer Martinez swung her head back and slapped her thigh before smiling back at Marcus, taking a piece of the slimy fry and inching it towards the young man’s mouth. Marcus reluctantly opened his jaws and proceeded to take the bite that the officer fed to him.

“Okay, so, it’s good right?”

“It’s whateva”, replied Marcus 

Officer Martinez laughed with ah eye roll 
“Bet you can’t do better”, she teased 

“What like cook!?” Marcus exclaimed with lowered brows 

“Yeah, can you cook?” asked the officer

“Yeah I can cook”, replied Marcus as he proceeded to volley ego’s with the officer  

“And just what do you cook?”

“Any and everything”

“Is that right?”

“Correctomundo”

“That’s not how you say it but anyway, can you cook steak?”

“Absolutely”

“Rib-eye?”

“Damn straight”

“Tenderloin?”

“No doubt about it”

“Mm”, Officer Martinez smiled as she bit down on the rim of her water bottle 
“Okay, make me a tenderloin, medium rare, lots of juice, like super juicy, and uh..whatever kind of sides are in your repertoire and maybe…I’ll swing by tomorrow.

Marcus locked eyes with the officer, feeling the sudden sexual tension slowly start to the fill the air 
“Maybe huh?”

Officer Martinez grabbed the plate of fries and stuck it in Marcus’ face

“Ah hell nah”, Marcus uttered 

“Take another bite and I’ll turn my maybe into a yes”, Officer Martinez said while donning a devious smirk 

“You’re evil, aight, pure evil”, Marcus opened his mouth as the officer fed him another gooey fry

Marcus chewed and exhaled as pure revulsion took over his facial expression  

Officer Martinez laughed amusingly 
“Okay…I’ll come by tomorrow…and that food better be good”

Marcus nodded, “Best steak you ever had in your life”

“We’ll see about that”, replied Officer Martinez, “You can text me your address and everything when you can cause my lunch break is now officially over”

“Fasho”, Marcus replied as he took a sip of his drink, feeling extremely relieved seeing his shot go in right at the buzzer 

Officer Martinez proceeded to dump her scraps and trash into her bag. She then paused and began to curl up in her seat
“Oooh…I gotta fart…”

An orchestra began to play sounds of sweet harmonic music in Marcus’s head upon hearing the three most beautiful words he had ever heard

“Show time”, Marcus quipped as he sipped his drink

Officer Martinez let out a breathy laugh but tried not to shriek you hard, there was a brewing gas bubble fermenting in her stomach, just waiting to burst 

Marcus watched on in great anticipation, the day just kept getting better and better

Officer Martinez pressed her hand into the side of her seat and squeezed her thighs together while leaning to the side. One eye beaded while the other remained open as her mouth hung agape like she was in the middle of a strong orgasm
“Oooh…wait…here it comes. Uhh!”

*BRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMRRRRRRRRR*

Erupting from the bubbly ass of Officer Martinez was bombastic blast of a fart that sent waves rattling throughout the car. A mixture of bass and brap plunged deep into the officer’s seat creating a sound that could only be described as, poetry. 

Marcus sat in his seat, speechless, but awestruck. It was just like he had remembered 

“Oh my gosh…Ugh…UGH”, Officer Martinez jerked her neck as she began to gag at the putrid stench of her own fart. An odor so rancid, so rank, pierced through the atmosphere like a sharp dagger. Marcus observed the scene as the thick, heavy stink of the officer’s gas created a large cloud around him. His boner grew more apparent in his pants though the officer was too preoccupied by her stench to notice 

“Phew..PHEW…” Officer Martinez fanned her behind as she tried to keep the stench from entering her mouth. She turned to Marcus with the top of her mouth separated from the tip of her nose
“Hand me that, in the back, the spray”

Marcus turned towards the backseat and grabbed a can of Febreze, needless to say the can was almost empty. He handed the can to Officer Martinez who snatched it and immediately began to perfume the entire car, holding her finger down on the can’s handle until the vehicle contained a combined aroma of fresh poop and edible arrangements.

Officer Martinez threw the can in the backseat before leaning back and exhaling 
“Damn that shit stinks…WHEW”, she proceeded to fan her face as it sat promptly scrunched 

“Just as an aside”, Marcus began, “You could use a new can of febreze and a hard working toilet”, the young man quipped as he and the officer bursted into laughter

Marcus and Officer Martinez wrapped up their meal, gave one another a hug filled send off, and proceeded to go their separate ways 

Marcus left Whataburger with a newfound light beaming in his heart as it’s bright shining rays radiated throughout his face. He had never felt so invigorated, so enthused. He not only reconnected with the woman of his dreams but he was able to snag her for an exclusive one-on-one date. In the meantime he now was headed back to work, thought not much was getting done that day as the only thing that mattered on his agenda was getting Officer Annalise Martinez one step closer to accepting him as her only true love.

1onn230,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1onn230/got_a_nissen_fundoplication_surgery_in_january_10/,"Got a nissen fundoplication surgery in January... 10 months later I fucked up, got alcohol poisoning and vomited. I'm afraid I undid my surgery. Learn from my mistake please. GET ANTI-NAUSEA MEDICATION AFTER YOUR SURGERY AND DON'T DRINK.","Oh boy. So just to give some background: I'm a 33M and I had a long battle with depression and alcohol abuse between 2018 and 2023, where I went from drinking socially and gradually delved into drinking everyday for almost 2 years. Alcohol ruined my whole digestive system and I developed severe GERD, LPR, and IBD. 2023 is when the pain became intolerable and I stopped drinking, only socially drinking one or two drinks every 4 - 6 months. My IBD healed completely after a couple years of being virtually sober but my GERD and LPR never went away. My LPR got really REALLY bad. I couldn't swallow, I couldn't eat meals with my wife, I couldn't lay down flat next to my wife to sleep, I couldn't have coffee, I had bad breathe from reflux, going out was dreadful because I had to worry about what I was going to eat, I lost about 40% of my hearing on my left ear because reflux traveled to my inner ear, I always had ringing and pain in my left ear, I also lost a lot of weight because I wasn't eating because eating just resulted in pain. It was affecting my outings, my marriage, my happiness, and I was incredibly anxious and depressed. It was controlling my life and I had chronic pain that was insufferable. I seriously couldn't eat anything or else I'd get really bad reflux flare ups no matter what I ate.

Fast forward to January 2025, I finally got a doctor convinced that I needed to get a nissen fundoplication surgery to subdue my symptoms. The surgery was a same day discharge and the recovery was pretty rough. I was limited to liquid foods and had to transition to solid foods over the span of 6 months. But after the recovery period was over, I was happy. My quality of life was so much better. I could go out and eat. I could have coffee! My marriage felt like it was coming back together because I could bond with my wife over a meal again. I could lie down flat next to my wife! It seriously felt unreal...

Then, last week for a Halloween party, I was a huge idiot and relapsed into drinking again that night because I was having too much fun. Morning after I felt like shit and thought I was in trouble because I felt like I had to throw up but I knew I'm not supposed to because of the surgery I had 10 months prior. I WASN'T given any prescribed anti-nausea medication after my surgery for some reason, my surgeon just didn't give me any. I tried to resist the urge to throw up but my body involuntarily retched. When I threw up, I dry heaved about 3 times and finally vomited some water I had just drank and some bile. No solids came up. Immediately after the bile came out, I belched a huge burp and felt a chest discomfort. Afterwards my chest was sensitive to deep breaths and I felt a sort of sore muscle aching feeling in my chest. Gradually over a week since I vomited, the symptoms I had before the surgery have come back almost in full force at the peak before my surgery. What's funny is that a few symptoms feel a lot like what it was like post-surgery: I'm belching micro-burps constantly, I feel discomforting soreness in my chest, and I'm sensitive to deep breaths. After 1 week the post-surgery symptoms have mostly subsided. I'm really worried because a few months ago I got laid off and now I don't have any health insurance. I'm signing up for Medicaid but I'm afraid the surgeon that did my operation doesn't accept it. I asked ChatGPT for medical advice and it insists that I probably haven't ""undone"" my surgery because I feel more discomfort than pain in my chest and also because I didn't throw up any blood and that my chest pain never got severe. ChatGPT also recommended that I go back onto the post-surgery diet and let the wrap heal for 4 weeks because it insisted I probably just inflamed the wrap from vomiting and that it's likely I'll get back to post-surgery results after the inflammation goes down (which again could apparently take 4 weeks according to it). So far I've been respectful of those guidelines for 1 week but man the reflux symptoms are back in full swing and I feel so stupid.

Yes, I'm stupid and I learn from my mistakes. I was in good health and the surgery changed my life but just over one night's stupid decision I threw it out the window by accident and I'm back to square one. I'm hoping the wrap just needs to heal so I can feel like how it was post-surgery before I vomited. I had my drinking under control and only had a couple drinks a year socially, but one night overdoing it ruined my life again. This is what it took for me to vow to never drink again and it's such a huge punishment and scare that I really take no drinking seriously. Alcohol is what did this to my body in the first place and I'll never have a good relationship with it again, not even one sip. Fuck alcohol.

I mostly have my life under control, but just one night's slip-up and all my progress feels like it's gone. Learn from me and don't drink if you get the fundoplication surgery. IF YOU GET THE NISSEN FUNDOPLICATION SURGERY, ASK FOR ANTI-NAUSEA MEDICATION. MY SURGEON DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY FOR SOME REASON.


I'm seeing a doctor soon though. Hopefully if I need to get it repaired, that'll be it for the last time. I'm ready and motivated to get my life back together again. I'm never drinking again man.


I'll post another update in 4 weeks to see if my wrap just needs to heal so I can feel like how it was prior to the vomiting incident. I'm hoping ChatGPT is right. I really took my health fore granted but man these experiences really change you as a person to scare you straight. Lesson learned. Life goes on. And I'm trying to stay positive and push forward.



TL;DR:
33M battled depression and alcohol abuse from 2018–2023, which led to severe GERD, LPR, and IBD. After quitting drinking, most issues healed except my reflux, which became crippling. In early 2025, I got a nissen fundoplication surgery that finally restored my quality of life—I could eat, sleep, and enjoy life again.

Unfortunately, I relapsed at a Halloween party, drank too much, and vomited, which is dangerous post-surgery. Since then, my reflux symptoms have returned almost completely. I don’t have insurance right now but I'm applying for Medicaid. ChatGPT advised that I may have inflamed the surgical wrap rather than undone it, recommending a soft post-surgery diet and patience for up to four weeks to let it heal and get back to how it was before the vomiting incident.

I'm now determined to never drink again, deeply regretting the drink binging relapse, and I hope the wrap will heal without needing repair. I'm seeing a doctor soon and I plan on giving an update after four weeks. Don’t drink after fundoplication—and ask for anti-nausea medication if you got the surgery.",1,1762201825.0,GERD,5,0.67,False

We have pretty much puppy proofed our house with gates, closed trash cans etc - so she can't get to most items on a consistent basis - but we recently picked her up from a dog sitter who seemed exhausted from her putting everything in her mouth - so it reminded us that we really need to improve this so she can be okay in any environment.

**Some more info:** When we are on walks she is very good with ""drop it"" if she picks something up on the sidewalk but at home she is always stealing anything she can get (underwear, socks, shoes, coasters, t-shirts, towels, magnets off fridge - the list could go on forever, but these are some of her favorite :D) and then running from us when we come anywhere near her. We have a bench on one side of her kitchen table and under it is her common hiding spot where we can't reach her and she can run us in circles around the table until we eventually have to totally move the table to get to her lol. She gets hyperfocused on the thing she has and gets this look in her eye like ""come and get it b!tch."" When we finally can corner her, she will drop the item and get all sad looking like she knows she did something wrong. It's also worth noting, she is usually not a destroyer - she rarely totally rips up toys or the items she steals (although she will chew on some enough to ruin it and sometimes she will go ham on the underwear).

**Things we have tried:**

* **We have tried EVERY high value treat and can not get her to drop it no matter what.** She will stare at her favorite treat in the world on the ground a few feet away from her and still walk away from it if it means getting near us where we could take what she has.
* We also have tried not chasing her + ignoring her and sometimes that works, but we don't like to rely on this tactic because sometimes she gets a hold of something she could choke on and we don't want to leave her with it.
* Our trainer said we should try playing with her more because maybe she doesn't get enough mental stimulation, which is totally valid idea - but we have been trying that but it doesn't seem to really make her steal things less.

She gets plenty of exercise - she gets 2 walks a day (on her long lead so she can explore and play fetch) and \~5 playdates a week with another dog who matches her crazy energy + she has plenty of items to chew (bully stick, coffee wood stick, chew toys). She is also on consistent crate schedule so she can get good sleep to keep her from getting overtired because she definitely acts out more when she is.

1onn01d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1onn01d/grocery_savings_tip_for_all_my_fellow_lactosefree/,Grocery Savings Tip for all my fellow Lactose-Free Milk Buyers: Use Milk Drops Instead,"If you're one of the lucky folks that has to look for ""Lactose-Free"" on every dairy product you buy at the grocery store (like me!), you've undoubtedly noticed they have a significant markup in price over the regular versions. Today, I'd like to talk about a product that I had never heard of until this year that has shaved a good chunk off of my monthly grocery bill: Lactase Drops.

# What are Lactase Drops?

Lactase Drops are a consumer-available liquid form of the lactase enzyme that is added to milk and dairy products to reduce the lactose content in them before consumption. It breaks down the lactose in the milk into galactose and glucose (which is why lactose-free milk is so much sweeter than regular milk!)

What are the benefits of these drops? Well, instead of being fleeced at the grocery checkout for as much as 35% more than the cost of the regular product, you instead treat your milk at home yourself! All you do is add the drops to regular milk based on how many litres you’re treating, shake it up, and leave it overnight to work: the next day, you’re good to go.

Much of the math up ahead is going to assume you’re buying your milk bagged instead of by the carton, like a good Canadian. If you haven’t made that change yet, you have even more savings to unlock!

# Costs & Savings

Lacteeze Milk Drops, as an example, currently cost about $20 CAD per bottle and advertise that a single bottle can treat up to 70L of milk\*. Note the asterisk, because we will come back to that later.

**Let’s look at a few average prices in your typical Canadian grocery store:**

\- Beatrice 4L Bag of 2% Milk: $6.25

\- Lactantia 4L Bag of 2% Lactose-Free Milk: $10.99

Holy Zeus! That’s $4.74 more for the same amount of product!

**Now, let’s calculate the cost of treating the Beatrice milk at home with lactase drops:**

\- Cost of treating one litre of milk: $20 divided by 70 per litre uses = $0.29

\- Cost to treat the 4L Bag of Beatrice Milk: $0.29 x 4 = $1.16

So, going off of these numbers, buying a single 4L bag of lactose-free milk at the grocery store will cost you $3.58 more than buying the same size of regular milk and treating it at home with milk drops. Over the course of using one bottle of milk drops (up to 70L treatable\*), that’s expected savings of around $62.50.

Are these life-changing numbers? Well, it depends on how much milk you and your family drink! A large family using milk for cereal, coffee creamer, baking, and so on can crush a lot of milk quickly.

# Effectiveness

Now, the real question: do these milk drops actually work? Effective results are dependent on two things: how lactose intolerant *you* are and consequently how much of the enzyme you need to use per litre to treat the milk so that it works for you.

\*The asterisk is back! The “up to 70L” assumption is that you’re only using 4 drops per litre, the lowest amount needed per litre according to the manufacturer (Lacteeze, in this case). They recommend a range of 4 to 16 drops per litre, which can drastically change the numbers we used above. Personally, I’ve had no issue using 4 drops per litre, but someone with greater intolerance to lactose might need to use more. The cost benefit to using the drops breaks down once you’re using 12 drops per litre. This requires some trial-and-error to find your tolerance.

Someone will undoubtedly point out in the comments that you can buy lactose enzyme pills and use them during every meal for less than the cost of all of this. To that, I will say that in my personal experience lactose pills have worked great for products that use dairy (cheese, ice cream, etc.) but they haven’t been as effective for consuming the real thing directly. This is also just a great alternative if you hate chewing or swallowing several pills every time you want to have a bowl of cereal.

We both seemed mutually REALLY into each other. We had a few really nice dates, casual and quick because we both have busy schedules, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. The day after we had some coffee together before his shift, he let me know that he was getting really busy with school and work, which I was aware of (he was to tired to even put in his contacts the morning of our date the day before). Fair enough, I don't want him to string himself out for me. He said he didn't want to end things, but he can't really focus on dating. He also said he didn't want to make any hard and fast decisions on if we should just stop talking while he stabilizes his life.  
So now a month later, that means I'm living in this ambiguous grey zone, fighting for my life to get a response from him at all and I know I can only \*really\* know what he's told me, but I also think he's just not interested at this point and is  hoping time will kill this so he doesn't have to.

My question is, at least 95% of my relationships or romantic attempts (not including hookups) have ended in ghostings (not to mention at least one of those also came along with the other person actively cheating on me but that's besides the point). Since there's never really any closure, all I know is: I AM the common denominator; not that I'm trying to say ""I'm the problem,"" BUT there HAS to be something I can be doing differently, right?

A month later, he then wanted to move forward with a written warning but HR hasn’t given me a copy yet and not sure if they are approving the written warning to be issued.

Today, he came back and he was gone for 2 weeks due to PTO. We also had an organization change so now I report to him directly. Prior to him leaving on PTO, he said he didn’t observe any of the behaviors that he had documented in the 2 weeks prior to him taking time off, nor had he heard any complaints (I still do not know who is complaining), but I feel like I’ve been slipping up a bit and want to come clean during the next meeting before he may hear it from other people since I value honesty and I have autism (already disclosed) and it can be hard for some people with autism to lie.

These were some areas of his feedback where I feel like I slipped up and want to be honest with him about me failing to adhere when he was absent but also in case people are waiting for him to come back to complain and then he gets like 10 different people saying I’m doing these things again.

Do not leave office supplies or other loose items (except water bottle) on desk at anytime. Put them in your drawer immediately after you use them.
* I left my desk a few times leaving loose papers pens and stamps on my desk but put them away when I came back.

Do not stop people in passing for a conversation. Allow them to reach their destination without interruption.
* I slipped up and asked someone about a work related thing when seeing them in person.

When talking to someone about work related conversations, do not change to non-related work topics. If someone asks you about non-work related topics, hard stop after 2-3 minutes and return to work at your desk.
* We had a company potluck last week and I feel like I was being too disruptive.
* I also asked someone about something not work but hard stopped after a few minutes.

Do not follow up in person after sending an email or teams message. Allow time for the recipient to respond.
* I forgot and accidentally did this once.

Do not speak to people getting coffee behind your cubicle.
* Probably unintentionally did this once too (or speak to them when they were passing by my desk).

He also moved me next to his office. I can’t sit with my team. Once I moved, I learned that he also talks with other people, mostly managers in his office and also jokes around with them constantly. I sit next to them so I can hear everything if they leave the door open and I’m actively listening.

Honestly, I truly believe the only reason the two managers I report to are willing to give me feedback is because people say I have a good work ethic and am good at my job. Would it hurt me to fess up or should I keep my mouth shut and let him (possibly) find out?",1,1762201568.0,careerguidance,25,0.66,False

I used to think change needed a reason. A new job, a breakup, a crisis that pushes you out of the old skin. Then I came to Thailand and realized that sometimes you change because you can breathe differently.

Pattaya is not what people imagine. It is messy, kind, honest. Mornings start with mango and street coffee, evenings end with sea breeze and no hurry. Rent costs less than a week of groceries in London. The sun feels earned, not borrowed.

For a few years I lived here fully, without plans to go back. But London called again, like a polite ghost that smells of rain and responsibility. I returned, but I never stayed for the whole year. Each winter I come back to Thailand for a season that feels like a cure.

Here, medicine is precise and calm. A hospital visit feels more like a conversation than a transaction. Prices are fair, care is human, time moves slower. People smile not because they have to but because they do.

Now I live between two worlds. I build my business in England and grow another one in Thailand. I want to bring what is wise in one place to what is alive in the other. I am not chasing success anymore. I am collecting mornings that make sense.

Sometimes I think the West teaches us how to work, but the East quietly reminds us why we live.

And maybe that is what I am writing about here - the small details of building a life that fits better than it looks.  
If you are curious about this mix of rain and sunlight, follow along. I will keep sharing the quiet things that changed everything.

1onmvjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1onmvjh/dead_men_eat_the_trees/,Dead Men Eat the Trees,"Dead men eat the trees.

My parents told me that was just a metaphor— some old adage that townsfolk used to mean… anything, I think? I've heard Uncle Roger and his friends say “Let's eat the trees” when they planned to go on a hike. My mom and her friends mutter it like a curse when some gossip comes up about who’s with who. Children on the playground play a game similar to tag— only the losers “drop dead” and have to lick a tree.

It's a saying that everyone knows, but no one seems to understand. That's the funny thing about language though— it had to have come from somewhere. 

As far as I know, ”dead men eat the trees” is a phrase confined to the town of Denborough, Oregon. Why anyone still lives here is more of a mystery to me than the infamous saying is. Waterfalls and rivers that had once made the place beautiful have run completely dry. Forests that would be perfect for lumber have become infested with some kind of parasitic beetle, sorry ugly things that eat the wood from the inside out, leaving the trees hollow. Over half of the forest was dead by the time I was old enough to walk in them. The wind would search until it found every passageway into those empty shells. Its constant whistle signaled that this was no quiet wood; something was always singing.

“Are the parasites the dead men?” I asked Uncle Roger. Even at eleven, I figured there was some kind of connection. Uncle Roger took a long time to finish his sip of weakly-brewed black coffee. 

 “Parasites are parasites, and dead men are bodies.”

“So… it’s not a metaphor?”

“Beetles aren't the only thing that can eat trees,” he says, “look—” He takes out a piece of bark and plops it into his mouth.

I just stared at him. He kept chewing.

“Haha— Oi, Sammy—” he says with mouthfuls of wood chips, “guess’m a dead man now!”

I laughed with him. I laughed so hard I only barely caught what he said afterwards. 

“It’s how every man in this town ends up anyways,” he wheezes, “A corpse fulla’ bark.”

My laughing slowed. His did not. He laughed—guffawed— boisterously and boldly until his breathing strained. His face reddened to a violent shade as sweat permeated his forehead. 

My parents weren’t home and I was only eleven. At least, that’s my excuse for being useless.

His warm blue eyes darkened, pupils shrinking, then rolling back. His mouth, just full of bark and laughter a moment ago, was spewing out chips and a sickening gurgle— something that should’ve been a cough but didn’t have enough room to leave the lungs. Eventually, something did come out. It crawled forth, forcing its terrible body out of his pursed blue lips. Dark, hard-shelled obsidian wings buzzed to an awakening. 

Parasites don’t make eye contact is what I remembered thinking. That’s what they told me in science class. But something in that bug seemed to acknowledge me. 

A small piece of bloodied wood trickled from my uncle’s mouth. The black beetle chiseled away at the meal. 

Slowly, I found myself reaching for my shoe. The parasite was still on my uncle’s face. Was he really dead? I gripped the rubber of the converse. Whether or not he was, that demon spawn certainly will be.

Smack.

Blood and brown fluid smeared across the white of my good shoe and my uncle’s cold face. He flinched. The tension relaxed in my chest. Hope sparked. Good, I thought. You really had me worried there.

His eye twitched. Then his jaw. It seemed his tongue was pushing up against the side of his cheek. Then… another tongue? And another. His cheeks began to bloat, a cancerous mass pushing its way towards the mouth. Black, shiny wings protruded once more from my uncle’s blue lips. A swarm crawled out like a writhing muscle, a pulsing legion. 

I wanted to run, to scream, to swat them to hell and high water. Nails dug into my shoe. The muscles in my hand tensed. And tensed. Until… my grip loosened from the sneaker. The rubber landed with a thud. There was a force in the way they flew—the way they danced— around my Uncle’s cold temples. 

Something equally attracted me as it repulsed me.

One came to me. It chose me. It tickled as it landed. The beetle pulled its obsidian body up my arm. It couldn't have taken more than one or two good shakes to get it off, but I held myself as still as a photograph.

I let her crawl until she found her way to my nose. It stung as she went in. She burrowed herself into the cartilage. I felt a rubbery gnawing as blood trickled from the nostril. I still don't know where she stopped.

There wasn't a phone in the cabin. My parents wouldn't return until late tonight. It was just five hours of an eleven-year-old boy and a corpse. I should've been terrified. Yet during that time, there was a constant buzzing in my head. It was music.

When my parents came, they didn’t have to ask. No one in my town batted an eye at Uncle Roger’s sudden closed-casket funeral. I was never bothered by the funeral of any other man in this town either. For Denborough at least, I finally know where men go when they die.

The trees continue to sing. Not all of them are hollow, but now I know that it was never the hollow ones with voices. I’ll join my uncle soon, and my father, along with the rest of the men of this town. I’ll join the feast, the singing, the swarming joy of the masses, until this seed in my head finally breaks open my skull and all that was imperfect in me shall wither away and return to the earth. 

I now hold a small piece of bark in my hand.

Dead men eat the trees.

1onmvbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/fictionstories_/comments/1onmvbk/i_woke_up_to_find_a_note_from_myself_on_the/,I woke up to find a note from myself on the kitchen table. It changed everything.,"This morning, I found a note sitting next to my coffee mug, same handwriting as mine, same pen I always use. It said:

 “Don’t take the 8:15 bus.”

That’s it. No signature, no explanation.

At first, I laughed. Maybe I wrote it half-asleep. Maybe it was some kind of sleepwalking thing. Still, something about it didn’t sit right with me.

So I waited. Watched the clock tick past 8:15.

At 8:23, I heard sirens. Lots of them. Checked my phone. There’d been a crash, the 8:15 bus collided with a truck at the intersection near my work. No survivors reported yet.

Now I’m staring at the note again, and there’s something new written underneath the first line. Same pen.

 “You listened. Good. Now get ready tomorrow at 7:42.”
I didn’t sleep that night. I kept staring at the clock, watching it crawl toward 7:42.

What was supposed to happen then?
Why that time?

I set my phone to record video on the kitchen counter, just in case. I wanted proof, proof that something, or someone, was messing with me.

At 7:41, I felt the air change. The sound outside went quiet, like the whole world was holding its breath.

Then, right at 7:42, there was a knock on my door. Three slow knocks.
I froze.

When I finally opened it… there was no one there. Just another note taped to the door. Same handwriting.

“Don’t trust the reflection.”

I stepped back, my eyes drifting toward the hallway mirror. My reflection was there, but it wasn’t moving like me.

It smiled first.

I couldn’t move. My reflection just stood there, smiling, a perfect copy of me, except for the eyes. They were darker. Deeper.

Then it spoke. But its lips didn’t move. I heard the words inside my head:

“You did well. You survived the first two warnings.”

I stumbled backward, my heartbeat loud enough to drown everything else. “What are you?” I whispered.

The reflection tilted its head, mimicking the way I used to think, curious, almost gentle.

“I’m you. The version that didn’t listen. The one that died on the bus.”

My stomach dropped.

“Every time you avoid your death,” it continued, “I take your place. You get another day, I get another reflection.”

Then the mirror cracked from the center, a single, jagged line spreading like lightning. My reflection smiled wider.

“Tomorrow, 6:19.”

The lights flickered.

And for a moment, I swear, I saw my reflection step out of the mirror.

Edit: If anything happens tomorrow morning, I want this post to stay up. Maybe someone will understand what’s going on before I do.",1,1762201408.0,fictionstories_,1,1.0,False

I’ve tried frothers, cold-brew mixing, even collagen — still hit-or-miss.

1onmu8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1onmu8g/aita_for_texting_my_girlfriends_parents_after/,AITA for texting my girlfriend’s parents after they refused to meet me?,"
My girlfriend (21F) and I (20F) have been together for about two and a half years. She’s been living with me since her parents kicked her out. They’ve refused to meet me this whole time, even though I always thought we’d get along if they gave me a chance.

So, with her permission, I texted them from her phone to introduce myself and show them I wasn’t who the rumors said I was. A few days later, they sent back a ten-page essay (written by her grandpa) saying my message was “manipulative,” “disrespectful,” and “victimizing.” I honestly didn’t mean it that way at all, I just wanted them to know who I really am. Now I’m wondering if I overstepped.

TL;DR: My girlfriend’s parents refused to meet me, so I texted them to introduce myself. They replied with a ten-page essay calling me manipulative and disrespectful. AITA for trying to reach out?

My message: Dear [gfs parents names),
My name is [my name], although I’m sure you know that. I know you don’t like me, but I felt like I needed to say these things. I’m not writing this to try and change your views on my relationship with [gf] or try to change anything at all; I’m writing this for my own peace of mind. If you choose to never meet me, I want you to at least know who I really am. I know you have created your own version of me in your head based on rumors (which are most likely all made up and circulated from one lady, who liked me until she found out I was dating her daughter) and your own assumptions, and that’s what this is about. I want to tell you about the real me, not the fabricated one. I don’t know how much [gf] has told you about me or if you even listened when she did, but I’m not as bad as you think.

I was raised in a Christian household by my two wonderful parents. My mom is a SAHM, and my dad works at a hospital in [whereever he works] For most of my life, my dad was the pastor of my church. He still is, but our church has gotten smaller, so he now shares the position with a few other people. I am also a Christian, and I’ve always been very involved in church. I’ve grown up going to church every Sunday and Wednesday, going to VBS and church camps, and I help in our church services. I read the Bible every day, and have a habit of reading several devotionals a day as well, one which I have [gf] read with me.

My parents were always against gays growing up. They kept me away from anything involving them, and even with all their efforts to shield me from homosexuality, I realized that I liked girls at nine years old. It wasn’t because of the influence of anything or anyone, I simply was, and I knew. I didn’t really know what being gay was, I just knew I liked girls in the same way I liked boys. You can’t control who you have a crush on, ya know, so it just kinda…happened. I hid it, though, until I was twelve when someone decided to screenshot my texts and send them to people, who sent them to their parents, who sent them to mine. My mom was furious, and the next few years were rough. I was anxious and depressed. But when I was sixteen, my mom came around and decided she accepted me as I was because she would rather have a gay kid than a dead one. Now she’s my biggest supporter. She tells me and everyone she knows that since she started supporting me, she’s never seen me happier. She’s completely right.

I know you don’t believe that I could be a good person because of who I love, and that’s ok, but I am a good person. I am a Christian, and I love God. I pray for [gf] every night, and the two of you and your family, as well to make sure you all are safe and happy. I try my hardest every single day to be a good person. I try my hardest to be kind and helpful and if you ask anyone who truly knows me, they would tell you the same.

[gf] told me that [gfs dad] had told her before that she wished she’d get with someone who had dreams and aspirations and a job. He doesn’t know this, but I do. I’ve been homeschooled since kindergarten, and my mom started me a year early, so I’m ahead of most of my friends. I am a 4.0 GPA student from high school to now. I started dual enrollment when I was fifteen, meaning I walked into my first full year of college as a 32 credit hour sophomore. Now, I’m a nineteen year old junior in school to be an elementary education teacher. I know teachers don’t get that much money (even though they really should get so much more), but they’re the foundation of this world, and I want to be a part of that. I’m a preschool dance teacher, a student worker at [my colleges daycare], which is like a daycare, and a k-3 musical theater teacher at [a school]. Being with those kids and teaching them has only made me want to be a teacher even more.

If I was a guy, and you heard all of these things about me, you would be so excited for [gf] to date me, but since I’m a girl, you choose to judge. But if you think about it, I’m everything you could want for your daughter. I’m a Christian, I’m working, I’m actively going to school with all A’s, and I LOVE your daughter, more than anything ever. She is everything to me. I’m planning on marrying [gf] and giving her everything I possibly can to make her happy. I promise to be the best partner I can be, even if y’all don’t like our relationship. I promise to give her everything I have inside.

I want to thank you.

You did an incredible job raising [gf]. She is a wonderful human being, and I can’t say thank you enough for raising her to be the person I love with everything in me. I have never met someone who understands me like she does and makes me feel as loved as she does. She truly is amazing.

If either of you would ever want to, I’d love to get coffee or dinner or something, so we can properly meet and talk. I really want to get to know both of you.

I have a question, do we have any expected time or day as to when the power will be back to normal? Also, do you guys know any place where we can charge our laptops/devices while the power is out? I work at night so I need to find a place where I can charge my laptop and phones, either coffee shops or anywhere. Thanks! ",3,1762201200.0,SiargaoPH,0,1.0,False
1onmr8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1onmr8s/something_ive_noticed/,Something I've noticed,When I'm home and skip meals or fast I sometimes end up binging that evening. But if I'm out or busy I tend to not binge since I'm busy throughout the day so I can survive on coffee and  1 or 2 meals. And I definitely feel better about myself when I skip meals. I'm just mad at myself.  I made sm progress at the beginning of the year and then stopped. (wl wise).,1,1762201155.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False
