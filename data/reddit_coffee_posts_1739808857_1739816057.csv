I'm Paige, the owner of Garden Spot Nursery, ask me anything!","The Garden Spot was founded by Marcy Plattner over 35 years ago and has been a Bellingham staple and a gathering place for friends and gardeners ever since.

‚ÄãIn 1985, Marcy opened the first Garden Spot Nursery in Wallingford Center in Seattle. Five years later she opened a second seasonal location in Sunnyland Square where Cruising Coffee is now. After a few years, Marcy sold the Seattle Garden Spot Location and the Bellingham location moved down the street to the corner of Alabama and King Street. In January 2021, she turned the reins over to me and I have been loving working with Bellingham gardeners ever since. 

I grew up in Washington and moved to Bellingham to attend Western¬†Washington University, where I double majored in Biology and English.

In Spring of 2012, I walked in looking for a job to help me get through college, something flexible where I could work outside and learn about plants, and quickly fell in love with the work, the people, and the science of gardening. I started as a cashier and knew very little about plants. After a few years, I became the plant receiver and worked behind the scenes processing orders. In more recent years, I have worked the sales floor, helping gardeners and playing with plants.

I am thinking about my veggie garden this year and dreaming of more tomatoes!

1irqedu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyesight_Academy/comments/1irqedu/what_exercises_can_help_improve_peripheral_vision/,What exercises can help improve peripheral vision?,"

You ever get hit by something that was definitely in your field of view, but your brain just decided, ‚ÄúNah, let‚Äôs pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù? Like, how many times have I stubbed my toe on the same coffee table before I realize‚Äîmaybe the problem isn‚Äôt the table? Maybe I‚Äôm the problem?

That‚Äôs when I found out about peripheral vision exercises. Apparently, we can train our eyes like superheroes, which is great news because, right now, my vision range is somewhere between ‚Äútunnel-visioned raccoon‚Äù and ‚Äúhorse wearing blinders.‚Äù

So, let‚Äôs talk about some of these ridiculous, yet supposedly effective, ways to level up our side-eye game.


---

Step 1: The ‚ÄúWide View‚Äù Exercise (A.K.A. The Owl Simulator)

Alright, first trick: You stare straight ahead, but try to be aware of everything in your field of vision‚Äîwithout moving your eyes. Sounds easy. Until you realize your brain has been slacking off your entire life.

I did this and immediately discovered two things:

1. My roommate moves like a ninja.


2. My cat has been judging me from the corner for who knows how long.



This exercise basically turns you into a human security camera‚Äîexcept, unlike actual security cameras, you still won‚Äôt see the pole you‚Äôre about to walk into.


---

Step 2: The ‚ÄúSee Behind the Screen‚Äù Challenge

This one is next-level. You stare at your phone or computer screen but try to notice things happening just outside your vision. Because, apparently, the ultimate goal is to become a Jedi and sense disturbances in the Force.

I tried this, and within five minutes:

I became hyper-aware of how much my fridge buzzes.

I caught my dog sneaking up on me like it was a horror movie.

I realized I have way too much unwashed laundry in my periphery and now I can‚Äôt ignore it.


This exercise is dangerous‚Äînot because it improves vision, but because it forces you to acknowledge all the things you‚Äôve been deliberately not seeing.


---

Step 3: The ‚ÄúPeripheral Focus‚Äù Game (A.K.A. Side-Eye Bootcamp)

You pick an object in front of you‚Äîlike your laptop, TV, or that pile of dishes you keep pretending isn‚Äôt there‚Äîand without looking away, try to notice details about things on the edge of your vision.

Now, this one sounds useful, but if you do it too much in public, you just look like you‚Äôre giving someone the world‚Äôs creepiest side-eye.

I tried this at a coffee shop and accidentally locked onto a guy sitting next to me. He thought I was trying to establish alpha dominance. I was just trying to see if my bagel was still in my peripheral vision.

So yeah, be careful with this one.


---

Step 4: The ‚ÄúRandom Flash‚Äù Reflex Test

This one involves having someone wave their hand suddenly at the edge of your vision to see if you react. I tried this with my friend. Turns out, my reaction speed is about as quick as dial-up internet.

By the time I realized they moved, I had already been smacked in the forehead. Effective? Maybe. Humiliating? Absolutely.


---

Conclusion: Is It Working?

Look, if you commit to these exercises, you might just unlock true peripheral awareness. Or at least stop walking into every single object in your house.

But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîno matter how much I train, I know I‚Äôll still never see that one rogue chair that my pinky toe is destined to collide with. Some things are just inevitable.

Until then, if you catch me staring blankly at a wall, just know‚ÄîI‚Äôm not zoning out. I‚Äôm training. For science.

I am partly blind, this has never affected my work and I can do everything just fine, it also doesn't affect me on an emotional level as I was born this way and I honestly don't give it much thought 

Me and my boyfriend have only been dating for about 5 months now but I met his mother really early in our relationship since we work at the same restaurant and she often came to have  coffee here. 

This post is not to bash her in anyway she is an amazing woman and we get along really well.

The issue I have is that she always strongly stated that she has always told my boyfriend that she doesn't care who he dates as long as he is happy, her words "" fat, slim, tall, blonde, brunette, white, Hispanic, black, I do not care as long as she makes my son happy"" 

She found out about my disability when she noticed I need to be really close to things to be able to read something and asked me about it

Now whenever she goes on her rent of "" idc who my son dates"" she makes it a point to bring up my partial blindness as an example of the categories she has listed. This honestly makes me quite uncomfortable and I'm sure she doesn't mean it in a harmful way, that is why I am wondering if I would be the asshole to bring it up with her or just suck it up and deal with it because  she s quite a people pleaser and I know she will be VERY upset to find out she is making me uncomfortable because I'm sure she doesn't realise how that might be offensive to me.

1irq72l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1irq72l/41f_confused_about_38m/,41F confused about 38M,"I, 41F, started dating K, 38M, 3 months ago.  We met for coffee and he immediately asked to see me again.  We met up two days later and were totally smitten with each other.  He started coming over every day and we were spending all our time together, so he moved in with me shortly after.  

Things were good for two months until I woke up in the middle of the night one night and he wasn't there.  I walked out of the bedroom and the kitchen light was on but no one was in my place.  The front door was unlocked but he wasn't outside.  I texted him to ask where he was and he showed up a couple minutes later.  He said that his ex, whom he shares 3 kids with and said he had broken up with 2 years previously, had called him a bunch of times in a row, so he thought that something had happened to them, but he said she just wanted to yell at him. I asked him why he didn't just hang up and he said he didn't know why and to just leave it alone. 

A few days later, I was still thinking about why he would take her call just to listen to her yell, so when he got home from work, I asked him why he'd put up with it.  He said that he felt like he should because he had cheated on her towards the end of their marriage and felt like he deserved it.  Apparently, the girl he'd cheated with had reached out to his ex recently and was telling her all the lurid details, so he felt like he should listen. 

Maybe another week goes by, and he'd been working late.  He gets home, pulls a chair up to my side of the bed and says fuck it, I can pack my shit up, I need to tell you.  I'm a little shocked but I'm like ok what.  He said first off, I need you to know I didn't cheat on you.  Ok... he goes on to tell me that he hadn't broken up with his ex two years ago.  He broke up with her in June 2024. He had cheated on her for two years and was with the girl he cheated with until a month before we met.  The reason his ex was pissed is it's still fairly fresh.  I asked him if he was cheating on me and he said no.  I asked if he had cheated on me.  He said no.  I said ok.  Then we can move forward.  I don't like that you lied to me, but we can make this work. 

About two weeks go by and every little thing is making me suspicious.  Then this past Monday, I'm on Facebook and I see a post that a woman has made that says something like ""I wish we could spend the night together after being together all day."" He had told me that he was spending the weekend at his parents to help them cater an event, and he'd called me a couple times and I could hear his parents in the background and their dog barking.  It was still really fucking weird though.  

I texted him and we like wtf is this.  And he said it's just a girl I went to high school with.  I can't control what other people post on my wall.  I told him he could delete it and tell her you have a girlfriend. I also said we'd talk more about it when we got home.  He sent me a text later saying ""we're going to fight about this aren't we?""

By the time I got home, he was already home.  I asked if he was cheating on me and he said no.  I said then we don't have anything to worry about.  I would like you to cut off communication with this woman though.  He started needling me, saying I'm always asking if he's cheating, and ever since he told me he cheated, I look at him differently.  I finally asked him to pack a bag and go to his parents. We would take the week to think about things and discuss on Saturday. 

I woke up early the next morning, and just felt like something was off.  He'd given me his password for his socials, so I logged in. The girl from the previous day had tagged him as her boyfriend.  I looked at his chats and he'd been talking to his ex, saying the ball is in her court about getting back together.  His best friend, who is a woman, had been sending him nudes and he repaired m responded positively.  He was also talking to a number of other women.  

I called him around 330am and told him we were done.  I said I'd call him on Friday night and tell him when he could get his stuff on Saturday. 

On Wednesday night, I felt like I needed answers, so I called him.  I asked him why he did what he did.  He said he was scared. We moved really fast and were starting to fight about little things (I'd been single for four years and was not used to having another person in my space). He said he didn't love me. I asked him why he introduced me to his kids if he didn't love me and want be in his life and he said he didn't care what his kids thought.  He said he might want to be poly. It was a shit show of a conversation.  After an hour of not getting anywhere I told him that I'd call Friday night to tell him to come get his stuff.

On Thursday morning he called and asked if he could come by Friday night to talk. I agreed.  We talked for two hours but didn't really come to any agreement on anything except he wouldn't pick up his stuff the next day.  He did say that he had lied to be when he said that he didn't love me.  He said he loved me more than anyone he's ever loved and he loved me more every day.  

On Saturday, he asked if we could get drinks.  We went to a brewery together.  It was really nice until he left his phone at the table.  His music was playing so I picked it up to shut it off since he was no longer sitting there and we were getting ready to leave.  When I picked it up, there were two messages from the girl who said they were bf/gf. I didn't read them, but he had told me he'd blocked her, so I knew he'd lied to me again.  

When we got to the car, I asked him to pull out his phone.  He flew off the handle and started driving erratically.  When we got to my place, he started punching his steering wheel and ripped his apple watch off his wrist and broke it.  I was scared but also didn't want him to get into a car accident or anything so I asked him to come into my place.  He told me he was scared and ran away.  He said he fucked up everything and was losing the best thing in his life.  He said his depression meds were off and he needed to up them so he didn't feel this way.  He said he didn't have any support at home because they don't believe in doctors or mental health.   We talked for four hours.  Talked about everything. He said he was going to delete Facebook and Instagram and block everyone except his ex because they needed to be in communication for their kids.  He said he wanted to make it work. 

I know all of this is red flags.  I know it.  I love him beyond reason.  We're supposed to take his kids on a trip next weekend and I don't know if I should do it.  I told him that I wouldn't make any decisions until after the trip but I don't even know if I should go.  Is there any possibility that this doesn't go south again and we can make this work?",1,1739815358.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

The sun hasn‚Äôt fully risen yet, but she opens her eyes with a peaceful smile. The cool morning air fills her lungs as she takes a deep breath and stretches, ready to embrace a new day.

Her bare feet touch the cold floor, grounding her in the present moment. She walks to the kitchen, her hands gently reaching for the coffee maker. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the space, wrapping her in warmth and comfort.

She carefully adjusts her hijab, making sure every fold is in place. Her elegant abaya drapes gracefully over her shoulders. A quick glance in the mirror‚Äîher eyes shine with confidence. Her wedding ring glistens under the soft morning light, a reminder of love and commitment.

With a steaming cup of coffee in hand, she steps toward the large glass window of her apartment on the 48th floor of a towering skyscraper in the heart of the city. Below her, the streets begin to wake, bathed in golden sunlight. The world moves, and so does she‚Äîsteadily, purposefully.

She takes a sip, savoring the rich taste, feeling its warmth spread through her. Success tastes just as satisfying.

Now, it‚Äôs time to work. She sits at her desk, opens her laptop, and connects with her colleagues. The day ahead is filled with ideas, projects, and possibilities. She smiles‚Äîcontent, empowered, and grateful.

From the 48th floor, she watches the city move beneath her, knowing she, too, is a force moving forward with grace, ambition, and faith.

Both report spikes in VOCs that correlates with my thermostat changing from Sleep to Away. This has been going on for a while now. I just had my furnace checked out by an HVAC professional a few weeks ago, so I think he would have caught anything major, and the air quality problem existed before this service visit.

What could be causing this spike in VOCs? My wife leaves for work around 7am, usually doesn't shower or cook in the morning. I work from home and don't shower most mornings, and at most I'll make coffee. Last Wednesday we were both home from work and I changed the thermostat to just hold the temperature at 71, and the spike in VOC doesn't show up. It seems to be directly correlated to anytime the temperature drops.

I've heard of people having cracks in their heat exchanger and VOCs rising when the furnace runs, but this seems to be the opposite. What could be going on?

1irq3mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1irq3mg/nespresso_machine_system_considerations_ol_vs_vl/,Nespresso Machine System Considerations - OL vs VL (OriginalLine vs VertuoLine),"I have posted this in comments and elsewhere but figured I would make a dedicated post for it. 

There are two Nespresso systems to choose from: OriginalLine (OL) and VertuoLine (VL). The machine box/description will indicate which it is for, but (at least as of now) all the VL machines have the word ‚ÄúVertuo‚Äù in their name. 

# OL #

OL is their oldest system and has been around since the 1980s in some form or another. For a long time, they were the only ones making pods for them, and they charged a premium for that. In 2013, they lost a patent case, and now (with some feature exceptions such as a silicon gasket and paper filters) anyone can make OL pods. 

This has, by and large, decreased the relative cost of OL pods. Nespresso still charges quite a bit for their OL pods ($0.80-$1 USD per pod), but you can find third party pods for as little as $0.25/pod, with the average being probably around $0.50-$0.60/pod. 

OL works by applying pressure (up to 19 bars in theory but in reality much lower) to the grounds, similar to espresso, though many espresso aficionados will argue (rightly so, for the most part) that there are miles of difference.

OL pods only come in one size, but the amount of coffee in them varies. Most of them work best as what Nespresso calls Espresso (size), which is about 40ml finished volume. The OL machines also have the option to brew a Lungo, which is about 110ml. 

Some pods work better in the Espresso size and others in the Lungo size. There is also a smaller size called Ristretto, but most machines don‚Äôt have a button for that. Generally, the producer of the pod will indicate what size they feel is best for each pod, but there is an individual taste preference here as well. 

# VL #
The key differences of VL are two: only Nespresso is legally allowed to make the pods (at least until 2030), and instead of applying pressure, it brews by spinning the pod at thousands of RPMs. 

The result of the Nespresso exclusivity is a higher price. The average price is around $1.25, but the prices range mostly from $1/pod up to about $1.50/pod, with the most expensive being $3/pod. 

They do have marginally larger amounts of coffee in them (6-17 grams vs about 4.5-6 grams for Nespresso‚Äôs OL pods), but the cost of these is in the convenience, not the coffee. (Side note: with VL, you‚Äôre paying around $50/pound for coffee. Anyone who has purchased coffee before can tell you that‚Äôs way more than you‚Äôll pay for a bag of beans or grounds. You‚Äôre paying for convenience and (debatably, though in my opinion definitely) higher quality coffee and higher quality grounds. OL runs about the same or more if buying from Nespresso.)

The result of spinning the pod instead of using pressure is that the extraction happens by the water hitting the grounds at high speed. This produces a foam that Nespresso calls crema but which espresso aficionados say is not real crema. 

OL pods, on the other hand, create a crema that is very similar to espresso because it‚Äôs the same process used by espresso (meaning it is espresso IMHO). 

Because they can charge a premium, and because it‚Äôs their newer product, Nespresso also often has limited editions available for VL that they don‚Äôt make available for OL. Not a big loss honestly but something to consider. 

# My Recommendation #

Buy both! I bought a VertuoPlus during this past Black Friday. Then I bought an Inissia (OL machine) on FB Marketplace for $25. Had to take it apart and do a deep clean, which I would recommend if you get a used coffee machine of any kind/brand. After that it started making delicious coffee. 

If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about how Nespresso machines work, James Hoffman has some great ones.

1irpvol,https://a.co/d/dGBwKYk,Here‚Äôs a little coffee hack that is setting me up for a good day.,"I‚Äôve been adding Nature‚Äôs Bounty Protein and Vitamin shake mix to my morning coffee. It gets you 15 proteins, 6 fiber, biotin, and the equivalent of a multivitamin in one cup. All for just 110 calories. 

It‚Äôs not the most delicious shake I‚Äôve ever tasted, but it‚Äôs not bad. The chocolate definitely beats the vanilla. And the vegan option is way too chalky IMO. I add a bit of Truvia to taste and blend with a frother.

This little hack has been helping me in a few ways. Mainly, it lets me put off breakfast for 2 to 3 hours after waking which sets me up for an easier day of low calorie intake. I WFH so my schedule isn‚Äôt stringent. Your results could vary. 

I wake up at 8 AM, ‚òùÔ∏ècoffee at 8:15. 

If I‚Äôm not feeling satisfied, I‚Äôll have a second coffee with Gold Standard vanilla ice cream protein powder. A Fairlife or Quest shake works here too. 

This keeps me full until at least 11 AM. That‚Äôs when I have a ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù of protein oatmeal or Ratio 25 yogurt with Grape Nuts and fruit. Here I‚Äôm looking for filling protein and fiber.

This will keep me going until 2 or 3 PM. At that point, I‚Äôll grab either a Quest, white chocolate raspberry protein bar as a late lunch/afternoon snack, or perhaps a can of soup. 
 
A 500 calorie dinner fills me for the evening. 

If I‚Äôm not satiated after dinner, I might have another gold standard decaf with a protein powder, or if it fits, two frozen mini Clio bars.

The concept of my dummy Next.js website is pretty basic:

* When a user logs in, they will see different types of sweets.
* Based on their preferences, they can:
   * Indicate whether they like the sweet.
   * Rate the sweet.
   * Bookmark the sweet to revisit later.
* Their responses will be stored in a database, updating the columns: ""user\_likes"", ""user\_rating"", and ""user\_bookmarked""...

Little notes, cards, surprises all the time
You were incredibly thoughtful. My friends love you so does my family, and vice versa you‚Äôd tell me yours did too. 
We would get in the normal little arguments but we got so much better about talking them out. 
Then i started a new job and you did too.. but we were opposite schedules..
We made it work to the best of our ability for a while..

Then we moved in together..
I expressed often we need to schedule time to be more intimate, even though we were intimate in the way we would cuddle, kiss etc. but obviously we needed more. 
I‚Äôve gotta be up at 6 AM for work you‚Äôre not getting home until almost 11 PM or later from work it started being like we were roommates..
We would watch tv together and cuddle but we didn‚Äôt talk as much. Sometimes i didn‚Äôt mind this I liked laying with you.. I guess you did though but never mentioned this to me until it was too late.
You said we have different personalities which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but that it can be hard to communicate sometimes. 
I was always listening to you, sometimes I didn‚Äôt give the most feedback but I was always listening. 

I realized this recently and made us a couples challenge. And I showed it to you and asked if we could do this to get back to how we started, and I really thought you thought this would be a wonderful idea. What happened next blindsided me.
You said ‚Äúwe used to do this‚Äù 
And I expressed to you I knew that and that‚Äôs why I wanted to start actively working on doing it again! 
And then you said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise you I‚Äôm willing to put in the effort‚Äù 
And then you repeated that because I was trying to bargain with you, well why can‚Äôt you! Why can‚Äôt you approach this from a positive mindset and say you‚Äôll at least try‚Ä¶
And then 2.5 years with you down the drain like that because you didn‚Äôt think I was worth fighting for. 
Why? 
You always wrote in our cards ‚Äúthank you for choosing US everyday, on the good days but also on the hard days‚Äù 
And i did i chose us everyday, in the meal preps I would make to make your life easier, in the coffee pot I would set to just press brew in the morning, in the daily clean house and the animals taken care of..
But you didn‚Äôt choose us..
You think the grass is greener elsewhere I guess. 
I suggested couples therapy and I thought it would be great for us! And you again said you couldn‚Äôt promise the effort. 
These were such little fixes that we could have easily done. 
But you I guess fell out of love with me? 

One of your last messages to me said you still care about me and probably always will and this doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt love each other but you think this is best for us both. 
It doesn‚Äôt sit right with me how easily you threw in the towel.. 
especially because we just got finished spending the snow days together in January, you asked for chicken noodle soup so we went to the store got the ingredients and made it together, we made cookies together, we went on 2 doubles dates, to a wedding and a solo date all in January and you ended it at the end of the month..? 
How am I not to be confused? 


I moved out, and I wrote you a letter with my final thoughts and feelings and I said I hope this is not our last time seeing or speaking to each other and maybe down the road we will be better for each other and I hope you reach out one day. But it doesn‚Äôt feel like you will. 

Now I‚Äôm blocked on everything, why did you need to block me? 
There‚Äôs a hole in my heart where you were and where I was planning so many future plans for us. 
I can‚Äôt delete your messages yet and I can‚Äôt delete the pictures.

1irpqh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1irpqh3/would_i_be_the_ah_for_ignoring_my_friend_after_a/,Would I be the AH for ignoring my friend after a sort of friend break up?,"Disclamer: I'm leaving a lot of details out since this would be so much longer that it already is so bare with me. 

This all happened about 4 weeks ago. For context, me (f22) and my friend (f30) have been friends for 2.5 years. We used to work together and became friends immediately. We are both very similar but also very different. We both enjoy dumb jokes, philosophical topics, and books. Our main difference is religion. I have religious trauma from when I was almost forced into a cult of sorts, and she is a Christian. I made it very clear from the beginning that I will not discuss religion in any shape or form.

About 6 months ago, she called me and asked me if I was at work. I told her that I wasn't, and she answered something like, ""Aww, bummer, we would have wanted to say hi."" I asked who ""we"" was, and she told me she had a brother. Again, we had known each other at that point for 2 years, and this is the first time I heard about this.

I started to think about what else I don't know about her and realized that I basically only know where she is from, her age, the general direction of where she lives, and that she has a brother and a dad. I, on the other hand, am a big yapper and talk about myself openly. It kind of made me scared since I realized how much she knows about me and how little I actually know about her.

I thought it was a good idea to ask her for coffee and explain what I realized and ask her to tell me anything about herself. When we first met, she asked what had happened to me since I had a cut on my neck. I had been in a car accident, and the seatbelt cut the side of my neck a little. I didn't want to worry her, so I just said nothing, but she kept pressing the issue until I told her. I thought that since she had been really persistent with me, it would be okay for me to do the same.

I told her how I felt about not knowing anything about her and asked her to share something, anything. She was really hesitant and asked me why I wanted to know. I explained that I feel like I don't really know her since I have no idea where she is working (we both left our previous job where we worked together), what she was doing in general, if she had other friends, etc.

She dodged my questions almost every time or made it a joke and answered, ""I'm just this little silly person,"" and then cut herself off and was like, ""This feels like a job interview."" I explained again my issue, and she asked me to ask her something. I asked which area she lived in, and she answered, ""15 min bike ride or 5 min car ride from where you live."" I asked which direction, and she said she was unsure. I asked which side of the main road she lived on, and she wasn't sure. I then specified whether it was the side with the only school in the whole place or the side with the only store in the whole place. She answered, ""The other side?"" and I got fed up and asked her, as a half-joke, if she even lived there. She just laughed and asked to change the topic.

I started to feel really bad since we weren't getting anywhere, so I just shut up and thought that I would give her space to talk about anything, but we ended up sitting in silence for 9 minutes (There was a clock on the wall). She asked me why we were sitting in silence, and I explained that I wanted to give her space to talk about what she wanted to since I felt like I was interrogating her. She asked me if I had considered that this was the amount of information she was willing to tell. I asked her if she meant that she doesn't want to tell me more, and she answered that she feels that she views our friendship as ""surface level"" and is not willing to go any deeper. I told her that I don't feel comfortable with that since I prefer my friendships to be at least a little deep, as in knowing something about their personal lives.

I have always loved people with my whole heart. I tell people about myself openly, and people usually respond with that same energy. I want to feel free and comfortable around my friends. I hate the idea of having to play mind games with a person who should be the more smart or logical one of us based on our ages. I don't want to have to hide things from myself or not tell major milestones, etc., because someone else is not willing to share basically anything about herself.

I told her that I needed time to think about all of this, and she said she hated leaving things unresolved. I told her that I would need like 2 weeks to think this through since I had a lot going on with university and work. She said she also had a lot going on, so I suggested that she contact me when she felt she was ready. It's now been a bit over 4 weeks, almost 5, and I haven't heard anything from her. I'm sort of fine with just never talking to her again, but at the same time, I feel like I might need closure. I just don't want to reach out purely out of pettiness.

She was nice and I invited her to events hoping she'd connect with the community here and further build her following, but mostly she is just a great person and I enjoyed spending time with her. I missed her at an event after I requested they put her on the guest list then she didn't reply and said she is very busy with many people contacting her now and she hopes our paths cross again sometime. I replied but think she has ghosted me then she posted about how she hates fake friends who only hang with her for clout.

Almost 2 years ago an influencer visited my town. I saw her post about not having friends and wishing she had someone to meet up with for coffee. I messaged her and offered. We met up and got along. We hung out a few times whenever she was in town. I brought her to an event as my guest once. She officially moved here and I was so excited to see her again. We met up and I thought we had a good time. She expressed how she really wants to meet more people here and connect with the right ones to get on lists for event invites and PR drops. I spent the next couple months messaging my contacts recommending they add her to their lists. I am not an influencer, but I have lived here longer and know enough people to reach out and not seem like a rando. I talked her up and sure enough she got invited to events. I was thrilled. 

We were at the same event, but I didn't see her. I messaged her later because she posted she was there and I was curious how we missed each other (I was sitting near the door so I was genuinely surprised I missed her) and wished we could have said hi. She didn't reply for a week or two. Then she explained how busy she is now and so many people message her she misses messages. So happy for her about that. She then wrote that she hopes our paths cross again sometime. I replied expressing how I hope that too and enjoy our friendship, but she hasn't seen it. She's busy, I get it. I'm happy for her in that way, but I guess I feel like I did something wrong for her to not consider me a friend she'd like to make plans to see. 

I then realised maybe there is subtext, so I wrote and asked if I had made a mistake in not tagging her properly in a post or something. I'm not an influencer like her so I don't know what the rules are. She is a BIG DEAL and I was careful the last 2 years to not post about her in a way that made it seem like I was trying to get her followers to follow me. But I now worry she felt like I wasn't letting her into my circle. That's the only thing I can think of. 

Then this week she posted about true friendships celebrating each other and how much she hates fake friends who only want to spend time with her for clout. I realize if she is posting this she has feelings about it because she is very careful to curate her posts for her 'brand'. Could it be me? I mean, I doubt it because I am not worth that kind of thought given she is successful online and I'm there mostly for fun. But it made me think that maybe she did interpret my messages or behaviour in an unintended way. I'll admit, I cried when I saw her post because she is making new friends right now and would think she'd be posting positive inspirational stuff to put out good vibes. That's why in my gut I feel like this may be about me (or maybe another 'friend', but after that message...). 

We live in a small town. I will likely see her again. Should I reach out again replying privately to the 'fake friends' post or should I just fade into the background? Either way, at events I will let her take the lead and if she ignores me I will politely stay away. But it's just so weird. I thought she was so genuine, kind, funny, and just a cool person. I tried so hard to not make a big deal about our friendship online so she wouldn't think I was using her for clout and now I think she somehow still thought that because I didn't. I just don't know.

# How I Went From Broke and Broken to Living My Dream Life

I‚Äôm not here to sell you fairy tales. I‚Äôve been where you are.

For¬†7 *years*, I struggled to manifest anything meaningful. I was broke 7k in debt (including to my ex girlfriend)... my relationship was falling apart right in front of my eyes and I couldn't control my feelings of jealousy and comparison..., and I was trying to launch a fitness business for years, jumping from one course or book to another, without making a dime, or getting any results.

I tried affirmation, looking in the eye in the mirror, hypnotherapy, did Tony Robins, Brian Tracy, 5-second rule, and every manifestation technique possible. Nothing changed.

Until after breakup I felt like I lost it all. And I dug deep to find out the real problem.

That's when I realized:¬†**I wasn‚Äôt stuck because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmanifesting right‚Äù ‚Äî I was stuck because my subconscious beliefs weren‚Äôt letting me have the life I wanted.**

That night, accidentally, I developed a method that forces the brain to find immediate proof that a new belief is already true. And here‚Äôs what happened:

* I went from¬†**daily social anxiety**¬†‚Üí to¬†**ever-lasting confidence, everywhere I go.** (over 10 years now, it has never diminished one bit)
* From¬†**7 years of failure**¬†‚Üí to building¬†**multiple successful businesses.** (I average 2k/day, often 5-10k for a single 45 minute consultation)
* From¬†**no money & struggling**¬†‚Üí to making more than I ever imagined‚Äî**without even working for it.**
* From having¬†**strong fear of rejection (difficulty dating)**¬†‚Üí to being able to¬†**effortlessly approach any 10/10 girl and it goes well every time.**
* From **having jealousy and insecurity** in relationship, to **having zero fears, or worries of relationship failing or being left**.
* From strong fear of rejection and approach anxiety to being able to¬†**confidently approach most gorgeous people**, and have it work out well - every time.

And it didn't just work for me.¬†The method I'm about to reveal to you, I tested with hundreds of people, and it worked every. Single. Time.

Because the method I discovered is composed of 3 scientific principles, proven to work all of the time - in everyone. They're always working, even this minute in everyone's lives.

But all of these transformations, singlehandedly, came down to one thing:¬†**rewiring subconscious beliefs to be in full alignment with the life you want.**

*\*I don't have much time. But I decided to come write this post, and share this method, because I know what it's like to believe and hope and not be able to be or have what you want. After being sick, this was my biggest desire. To finally be normal, like everyone else. And i couldn't. This was the only thing, that gave me confidence, success and freedom for the rest of my life. So this is especially for people, who I see in the posts need this the most.*

# The Real Problem: How Limiting Beliefs Are Running the Show

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight:¬†**Your subconscious mind doesn‚Äôt care about your goals.**¬†

It cares about **keeping you safe**. First and foremost our brain is a survival mechanism, designed to watch the news and find out the potential danger or the bad thing that can happen.

This is KEY fact most people don't know:  *Your brain can‚Äôt distinguish between potential* ***physical danger*** *and potential* ***emotional danger.***

If your desires have even the slightest *potential* of emotional danger (rejection, failure etc.) and feel even remotely threatening, your subconscious will block out all the information that would help you GET THERE and instead create negative thoughts, emotions or an invisible block - sabotaging you every. Single. Time.

Think about it:

* **You can want 1 million dollars -** but if that means there's a potential to ‚Äòbe rejected by your close friends‚Äô, ‚Äòjudged by others‚Äô, or ‚Äòappear bad... or greedy in the eyes of others‚Äô - the mind knows that, and it will block all possible information, that would help you get there and make that 1 million.
* **You can want your ex back -** but your subconscious can see the potential of being left and abandoned again... betrayed... and the pain of being alone being on the other side... so it creates fear and invisible barrier, to preventing you from sending that message - creating conflict from what you want - and how you actually feel.

Every one of these fears and limiting beliefs are rooted in your **past experiences (memory).**

Your brain isn‚Äôt sabotaging you. It‚Äôs protecting you.

Your subconscious is designed to keep you in alignment with what feels ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù And if you haven‚Äôt rewritten your limiting beliefs, it will filter out any opportunities, ideas, or actions that would bring you the things you want.

This is why people ‚Äútry everything‚Äù and nothing works. They are focusing on the things outside, without seeing how their inside - beliefs - are creating their thoughts, emotions, behaviors, intentions, words and actions = all manifesting energies, attracting their corresponding reality.

**All these fears and limiting beliefs don‚Äôt come out of nowhere.**¬†They‚Äôre rooted in our childhood.

‚Äé

# How Your Childhood Created Your Limiting Beliefs

Here‚Äôs the kicker:¬†**Your current reality is a reflection of your past beliefs and memories.** Pre-determining your future experiences **- fate.**

And for most people, they are entirely invisible. Because most methods, approaches, gurus or even therapists often focus on the 'outside work'.

The problem is these beliefs are inside. About internal experiences.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

* **Shame:**¬†That time your parents give love to your sibling or a neighbor kid, and by comparison you feel that if you are worse than others or not good enough = you might not get love... or even worse - the one who gets left and can't survive.
* **Guilt:**¬†Remember those times your parents punished you for doing bad? Remember what happened when you got a BAD grade? Remember how society and movies show you what happens if you are BAD? And often... people with money = are bad?..
* **Fear of Rejection:**¬†Remember how it feels, when you cry and your parents got upset at you. Simply for being the way you are? And when the first time it was hard to make friends and somebody excluded you?
* **Fear of Failure:**¬†What about our parents expectations? What happened if we failed to meet them? Didn't we get punished? Wasn't it painful, to do something not the way we are supposed to do?

**Your subconscious mind is like a GPS.**¬†It‚Äôs programmed with all the data from your past ‚Äî good and bad. Pleasureful and painful. And it‚Äôs using that data to navigate your future. With every laser focus experience you are focusing in on (eliminating the rest), creating your perception... thoughts... emotions... and expressions.

So, if you‚Äôre trying to manifest something that doesn‚Äôt align with your subconscious programming, it‚Äôs like trying to drive to New York with your GPS set to Los Angeles. You‚Äôre not going to get there, no matter how many times you say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in New York!‚Äù.

This is how most people approach manifestation. Which is why they never get to their big destinations.

They never addressed the GPS! Which controls your manifesting energies - thoughts, words, actions, intentions and the circumstances they lead you to.

**‚Äé**

# Why This Works (And Affirmations Don‚Äôt)

Here‚Äôs the truth: most people only manifest small things because of the **placebo effect**.

When you first learn about affirmations or scripting, it‚Äôs exciting. It‚Äôs **new**.

1. You expect it to work, and because 2) you‚Äôre actively looking for proof, you find it ‚Äî thinking 'it works!' just like how a sugar pill can cure symptoms **if you believe it will**.

This is why all medical research is tested against this Placebo effect and BELIEF. The most powerful thing that can even cure physical illness.

But what happens then for most people?

Reality sets in.

Because when you try to manifest something *big* ‚Äî something that has a great potential of failure, ridicule, making a mistake, having people potentially turn on you ‚Äî you hit a wall. Whether you try and fail after first attempt. Procrastinate. Your mind always **shuts it down** before it even begins.

The resistance is so big, that after few failures - most people quit.

Nether affirmation, nor visualizations (for most people) do not address - how beliefs are created in the first place. From saying empty words, belief do not change. Words do not imprint. Why?

Our brain needs **Evidence. Experience.**

This is how ALL of our memories, emotions and beliefs are stored in our subconscious mind. Think about it. The every time you feel 'I'm not  confident', you have a REASON. And experience that happened, which became proof for that thought (belief).

The QPH Method, on the other hand, taps into your brain‚Äôs¬†**Reticular Activating System (RAS)** ‚Äî the part of your brain that controls what you see and focus on - allowing you to choose what you want to experience. Unlike affirmations, finding real evidence, that becomes emotional experience inside the body - energy, that is required to rewire neuronal pathways.

This is what allows you to create a belief of being confident, and then your RAS begins to see ONLY that. Finding evidence and experiences, where you did appear confident. Making you feel good and strong. Giving you a REASON to believe that you are!

And this method helps you achieve it as simply as affirmations do. In less than 2-minutes a day, but actually creating real subconscious transformation in only 21-30 days - permanently! If you have a lot of self-awareness, the changes can be seen and felt in weeks if not days.

You never have to say empty words or ‚Äúfake it till you make it.‚Äù. It‚Äôs about¬†*becoming it,*¬†so you don‚Äôt have to fake anything.

# Who This Is For (And Who It‚Äôs NOT For)

Let‚Äôs be real:¬†**Not everyone is ready to take responsibility for their reality.**¬†It‚Äôs easier to blame the universe, your ex, or your circumstances than to do the inner work. Passing away responsibility to outside world, things that are happening.

Most people aren‚Äôt ready to hear this. They want to believe manifestation is about ‚Äúhigh vibrations‚Äù and ‚Äúacting as if.‚Äù. The magic pill. They‚Äôll keep chasing techniques while wondering why nothing is changing. Never looking deep inside.

The mind even blocks many people from finding it or seeing it.

*...it would imply many of the faults... pains... are 'my fault'.. (pain)*

But in reality. They are not our fault. Because we never had the choice, for what experiences we will have early in our lives. That will program our minds.

I never had a choice, to not experience losing my dad at the age of 6, and how that will affect my fear of rejection, approach anxiety, jealousy in relationship, manifesting breakup... Growing up my mom couldn't give me money for lunch when I saw everyone else have some. I continued on a similar path and struggles in my mid 20's, living from paycheck to paycheck, in debt. Until I changed it.

Now I can never have the same struggles with rejection, dating, jealousy or relationships. I can meet anyone I want. I send my mom monthly checks so she has more than her pension each month. I changed all of that in a very short amount of time - seeing my thoughts, my emotions change... my life reshaping itself, right in front of my eyes.

As I‚Äôve tested this belief change method over and over, for over a decade now, with 10,000+ beliefs that I changed for myself and others, it has never failed.

The people who actually shift their reality are the ones willing to go deeper. They‚Äôre the ones willing to take responsibility, undo their past programming, and take control of their future experiences.

If you‚Äôre ready to break free from the cycle of small wins and finally create the life you want, then this is how you can start.

# The Method That Actually Allowed Manifesting BIG Things (Step-by-Step Process)

I call it¬†**The QPH Method**. It‚Äôs a simple, 3-step process that rewires your subconscious mind so you can finally manifest the big stuff. If you‚Äôre tired of small manifestations and ready to break past your limits, here‚Äôs what you need to do:

‚Äé

# Step 1: Identify the Beliefs Keeping You Stuck

This is the harder part. Because most of us are born and told that the world is outside of us. So we keep living in it, without seeing the connection of how each thought connects to emotion, which connects us to our experiences and circumstances outside.

The goal is to develop awareness of your subconscious thoughts and inner chatter arising, and begin to observe the - internal experiences - and what circumstances they brin us to. Because often, these internal experiences, when they are negative, they have specific themes. They create our desires.

Our thoughts, emotions and desires give us hints on what we may believe or find Painful, that is not benefiting us. When we begin to see and identify these patterns, that's when we can change our Wants into Have's and our pains into pleasures.

Best book that opened my eyes to this proccess is 'The Power of Positive Thinking' - By Norman Vincent Peale. Which is a book not about positive thinking. It's about noticing subconscious thoughts and their connection manifesting experience outside of us.

*\*Another huge thing that happened for me accidentally, was I was drinking Ashwagandha root extract as a supplement. Back then I didn't know what it really does. I thought it was to reduce stress. But Aswhwagandha has the power to sensitize every single cell in the body, and open up receptors - basically allowing to think faster, clearer - every thought is more vivid, every experience is more apparent, every imprint is stronger and easier. And many people who struggle with self-awareness, or 'seeing change', I found that ashwagandha helps activate this ability.*

After you know what it is you want (the lack) OR what emotion you want to move away from focusing on - you have to find the exact opposite of it.

‚Äé

# Step 2: Use the Law of Polarity to Find Proof of Its Opposite

Your subconscious mind can‚Äôt hold two opposing beliefs at once. In Psychology this is called Cognitive Dissonance.

If you find proof that your desired belief is already true, the old belief ceases to exist - automatically.

For example, if you think 'I want confidence' it means you don't have it right now. By implication.

But when you think I have confidence, you can no longer want it. Because it's something you have.

How do you find evidence and proof, that you have it already?

‚Äé

# Step 3: Ask a Focus-Shifting Question

Your brain filters reality based on what you focus on. Most people focus on what‚Äôs missing. That‚Äôs why they stay stuck.

Remember the famous quote in the Bible?..

It's also in the Quran... and other religious scriptures....

And it's there fore a reason. Because Gods greatest power instilled into everyone of us, including you - was hiding inside of you all along.

>*''ASK and you shall RECEIVE''* \- **The Bible (Christian Bible), Matthew 7:7-8**

>*''ASK me and I shall GIVE you''* \- **The Quran (Islam Bible), Surah Ghafir: 60**

>*''CALL to Me and I will ANSWER you.''* ‚Äì **The Tanakh (Jewish Bible), Jeremiah 33:3**

Our brains Reticular Activating System, which control our focused based on all beliefs and memories in our subconscious mind, can consciously be controlled, by - asking questions. Psychology experiments have proven, that human focus expands. And often when we look for things, we can find them - even if they are not there. Our minds begin to identify anything relevantly close, to what we look for.

>The second part of the verse is - *''Seek and you will find''* \- **The Bible, Matthew 7:7-8**

When you ASK a question, your mind goes into your subconscious, and finds - an ANSWER (receive). That answer becomes evidence, which we experience. Creating energy and emotion, that travels into our brain to form new neuronal pathways. And by law of polarity, naturally replacing exact polar opposite beliefs.

*\*When I discovered The QPH Method, I didn't see it through the eyes of religion. I lost faith and belief at the time. I relied it on my Medical degree with Advanced Psychology and dozens of books that I read. But later I realized, that my discovery and understanding, is a new human ability, which is literally a god given power. To change and control own reality and experience.*

So what do you do? Ask yourself 1) Positive 2) Assumptive question for belief you want to have:

* ‚ÄúHow successful am I?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow loved am I?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow confident am I?‚Äù

That's when you actually go from 'I WANT to be confident' (implying that I am not confident right now)

To 'I am confident' (Through the Universal Law of Polarity = replacing wanting, with having)

And you‚Äôll begin to see and notice experiences where you¬†*are*¬†these things. Over time creating more evidence, more experiences for what that specific word & belief represents in your mind.

You no longer have to try and CONTROL you thoughts and emotions. They change naturally, as a consequence of what you believe, see and experience.

But the important next step, is to make this belief unbreakable - permanent.

And you do this by making this question a habit. So that it finds evidence for you, subconsciously - for the rest of your life.

‚Äé

# Step 4: Reinforce It Daily Until Your Subconscious Accepts It

Unlike affirmations, this method forces your brain to accept the new belief as reality. The more you find proof, the more your subconscious integrates it. In **30 days**, this becomes your new default.

1. **Polarity:**¬†Focus on what you¬†*have*, not what you want (lack).
   * Example: Instead of saying, ‚ÄúI want to be confident,‚Äù assume, ‚ÄúI am confident.‚Äù
   * Why it works: Your brain can‚Äôt focus on two opposites at once. When you focus on having, you automatically eliminate wanting.
2. **Question:**¬†Ask assumptive questions that direct your focus.
   * Example: ‚ÄúHow confident am I?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow good does it feel to make money?‚Äù
   * Why it works: Questions control your focus. And your focus creates your reality.
3. **Habit:**¬†Repeat this process **for 30 days** to make it permanent.
   * Why it works: Your brain rewires itself through repetition. After 30 days, the new belief becomes automatic.

‚Äé‚ÄéThis is the QPH Method that I discovered. That worked for over a decade for me, without ever failing. With 10,000+ different beliefs I changed for myself and others.

‚Äé 

# The Hard Truth: This Isn‚Äôt a Quick Fix

Let‚Äôs be real:¬†**You have dozens of subconscious beliefs.**¬†Changing ONE doesn‚Äôt magically change your life.

For example you can create a belief of being confident. It doesn't automatically eliminate past painful associations of - rejection, guilt etc. The deeper, core beliefs, that are tied to our deepest desires and emotions.

Also, if you ask a question *'How am I a millionaire?'* it doesn't work, because the mind can't see an answer, of something you have never seen. It's not familiar. This is where visualization can help. To create a MEMORY of something that hasn't happened yet. And when it becomes strong enough - it has to reflect inside reality - outside.

**Affirmations were never intended to manifest** these types of things. Since their discovery, and even in Napoleon Hills books (studying Rockefellers, Fords, Edison etc.), affirmations were designed to help reprogram limiting beliefs. Not manifest.

Visualization was intended to - imagine your future, goals, desires, visions and dreams. (If you notice, this is exactly how most people are manifesting - always)

The actual practice of manifestation if about consciously using visualization for conscious, strong imprinting. Visualizing once is the same as asking a question once. It doesn't work. It needs that experience, to become so real, that the mind no longer Wants, and recognizes it Has.

But childhood... beliefs... are what allows some people to visualize and manifest millions, and for others - remain a dream, and a daily practice, without arriving to those dreams.

When I overcame my limiting beliefs, I never had to rely on any other method. I just go and get what I want, without anything standing in between. Without any emotion blocking me. And I produce results, outcomes and creations.

So if you want to manifest the life you never had, you have to work to undo the life you had - the difficult childhood... the bullying in school... the familiar reality of seeing parents struggle and feel pain when there's not enough money... the pain we felt when our parents couldn't afford a toy for us or a chocolate... the pain we saw on TV when we saw 'The pursuit of happiness' and the immense deep pain and emotional danger to be poor, to fail, to not have enough, to not be able to provide = and empathized with it... to where it became our association of failure *equals* pain.

These experiences created your beliefs. And those beliefs manifesting your life experiences. Inside and outside.

But here‚Äôs the good news:¬†**Now you can change them. You have a choice.**

**‚Äé**

# Final Thought

Manifestation isn‚Äôt magic. It already inter-connects with science. The double slit experiment. The rice experiment nobody could believe, tried it and was miraculously repeating on YouTube. The power of our consciousness is directly connected to physical world.

To gain control of this proccess, It‚Äôs simply about understanding how your mind works, how your beliefs create reality and circumstances - and using that knowledge to create the life you want.

If you‚Äôre tired of settling for small wins and ready to finally break through, the power is in your hands.

Now - **It's your choice.**",2,1739814103.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False
1irple0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1irple0/i_26f_am_ending_my_engagement_with_my_fiance_30m/,I (26F) am ending my engagement with my fiance (30M). Advice on next steps? TW: Suicide/Suicidal Thoughts,"First time doing a Reddit post - not really sure how this is done, but prepare for a long one.

The relationship has always been toxic. We met online and started dating 3.5 years ago. Before we started dating, I caught him lying to me about seeing other people (I was upset but also thought it was not a really big deal since we weren‚Äôt actually together). When I tried to end things there, he love bombed me and I fell for it, which led to us officially being in a relationship. Within the first year, I caught him making plans to meet up with other women, using a dating app while on a work trip, and crossing my boundaries in all kinds of ways with porn, onlyfans, etc. Every time I tried to leave, he would somehow convince me to stay. I basically moved in with him within 1 month of dating because I was afraid he was going to cheat on me if I wasn‚Äôt with him 24/7. 

Anyway, after busting him many times for this kind of thing, we stopped having sex pretty much altogether. I would initiate a lot to try to over-correct the situation, but would often get rejected and was told I was putting too much pressure on the situation. So i backed off and we went several months without ever having sex again. I told him I was feeling unsatisfied and that I would need to leave if we didn‚Äôt solve this issue. I told him that I felt like he wasn‚Äôt attracted to me because I saw what kinds of girls he would watch online and try to hook up with in our early relationship. He would reassure me that he was attracted to me and [insert lame excuse here]. We would ‚Äúreconcile‚Äù, he would initiate once sometime within the next week, and then we would go another 3-5 months until I brought it up again. I stopped initiating because I feared rejection and because I thought that if he really was attracted to me and wanted me in that way (like he said he did), he would initiate more than once in a 3-5 month timeframe. 

Fast forward a little over two years and he proposes to me. I don‚Äôt want to say that it came out of nowhere because we did go looking for rings together, but I didn‚Äôt expect that he would do it so soon because we definitely still had major issues that we needed to work through first. I said yes because I still wanted to try to make things work, and I felt a bit more secure and like he was choosing me for real. 

After almost a year of engagement we have the same problems. I suddenly got the strong feeling that it‚Äôs not going to work out between us and that if we got married, we would likely get a divorce relatively quickly. When i tried to discuss with him, he told me that I was just scared of commitment and that we haven‚Äôt even really tried to work on the issue yet. Also, when I told him that after all this time I still don‚Äôt feel like I can trust him 100%, he says I just keep living in the past. Side note: He also likes to mention how much he‚Äôs done to gain my trust back (texting me while he‚Äôs out, calling me at night when he‚Äôs on a work trip, and sharing his location with me). First off, texting me while you‚Äôre out to let me know what you‚Äôre up to every once in a while and calling me at night when you‚Äôre out of the state is basic communication in my opinion. Also, the sharing of location didn‚Äôt even happen until 2 months after we got engaged and I still had to ask him to do it. In the past, I found out about all of the cheating by snooping through his devices. So when we originally decided to try to make things work, in order for him to trust me I had to stop snooping and in order for me to trust him I just had to blindly trust again while he changed all his passwords and got to remain secretive‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Anyway, I told him that I don‚Äôt think he understands how bad he fucked me up with all of the cheating and crossing my boundaries and he tells me ‚ÄúI can never understand how you felt because I‚Äôm not you.‚Äù We‚Äôve had a couple of follow up conversations after that and I told him that I was really hurt that he said I wasn‚Äôt committed when I expressed concern of our future and that he just showed a total lack of empathy towards me when I was trying to open up about what he put me through and how that impacts my self image, etc. He stood 10 toes down that he could never understand how he made me feel at that time. I told him that he never even bothered to ask. Then he was like ‚Äúwell how did it make you feel‚Äù with an annoyed tone of voice. I told him that I didn‚Äôt feel like he was genuinely curious, and he then admitted that he was partially curious, but pretty much only asking because I told him I wanted him to ask.

The next day, we ended up setting up a couples therapy session for this week. On Valentine‚Äôs Day (a few days after we set the appointment), he goes out to get me flowers and coffee, and asks if he can read me pages from his journal since he‚Äôs not good at talking about his emotions and felt like he did a better job writing them out before talking to me. He reads it to me and it‚Äôs full of all the promises he intends to uphold to make things work. Also that he has signed up for his own individual therapy to work through his issues (I recently started individual therapy myself as well). I tell him that I appreciate him sharing that with me and give him a hug. Then he decides to say ‚Äúnot to be manipulative, but..‚Äù and drops on me that the past few days of tension between us have been really hard for him and that he was feeling suicidal. He told me that he locked up the handgun and was going to give it to our friend to hold onto because he was afraid of what he‚Äôd do with it. Naturally, I‚Äôm freaking out and crying because obviously I feel awful that he‚Äôs having those thoughts, but then he does the whole ‚Äúsorry i shouldn‚Äôt have told you, i just don‚Äôt think i can handle another breakup‚Äù. So I got super triggered by that because I have past trauma with this exact situation. My adopted brother literally killed himself in front of his girlfriend because she was trying to leave him. And my fianc√© was dating me when this happened.. so knowing all of this he still chose to go this route?? I was so upset and quite frankly, pissed off, that I left the house until our friend got there to pick up the firearms. While our friend was there, I packed up random shit into a bag and just got out of the house and didn‚Äôt talk to him for over 24 hours. I made sure that our friend was going to stay with him and monitor him for the evening in case he was really feeling suicidal. 

I felt like I needed to leave immediately because I‚Äôve heard so many stories of people who murder their significant other before killing themselves and I didn‚Äôt feel particularly safe being around him. I got worried about him after not talking to him for a day because typically I can monitor him through his discord status when he‚Äôs gaming or something just to make sure he‚Äôs ok. But I guess he decided to hide his status from me to appear invisible‚Ä¶ so I got worried and tried to call him just to make sure he was still alive. He didn‚Äôt answer, so I was preparing to go do a wellness check when my friend told me that she could see him active on steam playing a game in a party with other people. So then I just felt even more manipulated and more pissed off. I guess me calling him gave him the green light to text me and let me know how ‚Äúhe knows I need time to process this given my past trauma‚Äù but also that he ‚Äúfelt abandoned when I just left on Friday and didn‚Äôt check on him‚Äù. I told him that I did what I could to arrange for someone to be there with him when I couldn‚Äôt be on the Friday that I left, but he was right that I do need time to process everything and that we could talk more after the weekend. 

Well, after the weekend is here. I do not really know what to do or say now. We are supposed to have couples therapy this Wednesday, but I honestly feel like self isolating and do not want to open up and be vulnerable around him at all. I know that the best thing for me is to separate from him, but as you can see from the past, it‚Äôs easy to talk me out of leaving. I keep going back and forth between feeling guilty for walking out how i did and abandoning him but also being pissed that he even did any of this to me. I know I can‚Äôt just ghost him forever, I just really don‚Äôt know what the next step for me is here.

We own a house and two dogs together. Have joint finances as well. 

Feeling stuck. Any advice helpful. I understand I should have never been with him in the first place when he was lying to me before we were even together and that I should‚Äôve left when he cheated the first time, so please don‚Äôt call me stupid or grill me on that.

Most people in the manifestation and Law of Attraction space are only manifesting small things - angel numbers, free coffees, or random text messages. But when it comes to the big stuff - money, relationships, or life-changing shifts - they hit a wall.

Or they get stuck in the 'wanting' state, unable to escape it.

Why?

# How I Went From Broke and Broken to Living My Dream Life

I‚Äôm not here to sell you fairy tales. I‚Äôve been where you are.

For¬†7 *years*, I struggled to manifest anything meaningful. I was broke 7k in debt (including to my ex girlfriend)... my relationship was falling apart right in front of my eyes and I couldn't control my feelings of jealousy and comparison..., and I was trying to launch a fitness business for years, jumping from one course or book to another, without making a dime, or getting any results.

I tried affirmation, looking in the eye in the mirror, hypnotherapy, did Tony Robins, Brian Tracy, 5-second rule, and every manifestation technique possible. Nothing changed.

Until after breakup I felt like I lost it all. And I dug deep to find out the real problem.

That's when I realized:¬†**I wasn‚Äôt stuck because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmanifesting right‚Äù ‚Äî I was stuck because my subconscious beliefs weren‚Äôt letting me have the life I wanted.**

That night, accidentally, I developed a method that forces the brain to find immediate proof that a new belief is already true. And here‚Äôs what happened:

* I went from¬†**daily social anxiety**¬†‚Üí to¬†**ever-lasting confidence, everywhere I go.** (over 10 years now, it has never diminished one bit)
* From¬†**7 years of failure**¬†‚Üí to building¬†**multiple successful businesses.** (I average 2k/day, often 5-10k for a single 45 minute consultation)
* From¬†**no money & struggling**¬†‚Üí to making more than I ever imagined‚Äî**without even working for it.**
* From having¬†**strong fear of rejection (difficulty dating)**¬†‚Üí to being able to¬†**effortlessly approach any 10/10 girl and it goes well every time.**
* From **having jealousy and insecurity** in relationship, to **having zero fears, or worries of relationship failing or being left**.
* From strong fear of rejection and approach anxiety to being able to¬†**confidently approach most gorgeous people**, and have it work out well - every time.

And it didn't just work for me.¬†The method I'm about to reveal to you, I tested with hundreds of people, and it worked every. Single. Time.

Because the method I discovered is composed of 3 scientific principles, proven to work all of the time - in everyone. They're always working, even this minute in everyone's lives.

But all of these transformations, singlehandedly, came down to one thing:¬†**rewiring subconscious beliefs to be in full alignment with the life you want.**

*\*I don't have much time. But I decided to come write this post, and share this method, because I know what it's like to believe and hope and not be able to be or have what you want. After being sick, this was my biggest desire. To finally be normal, like everyone else. And i couldn't. This was the only thing, that gave me confidence, success and freedom for the rest of my life. So this is especially for people, who I see in the posts need this the most.*

# The Real Problem: How Limiting Beliefs Are Running the Show

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight:¬†**Your subconscious mind doesn‚Äôt care about your goals.**¬†

It cares about **keeping you safe**. First and foremost our brain is a survival mechanism, designed to watch the news and find out the potential danger or the bad thing that can happen.

This is KEY fact most people don't know:  *Your brain can‚Äôt distinguish between potential* ***physical danger*** *and potential* ***emotional danger.***

If your desires have even the slightest *potential* of emotional danger (rejection, failure etc.) and feel even remotely threatening, your subconscious will block out all the information that would help you GET THERE and instead create negative thoughts, emotions or an invisible block - sabotaging you every. Single. Time.

Think about it:

* **You can want 1 million dollars -** but if that means there's a potential to ‚Äòbe rejected by your close friends‚Äô, ‚Äòjudged by others‚Äô, or ‚Äòappear bad... or greedy in the eyes of others‚Äô - the mind knows that, and it will block all possible information, that would help you get there and make that 1 million.
* **You can want your ex back -** but your subconscious can see the potential of being left and abandoned again... betrayed... and the pain of being alone being on the other side... so it creates fear and invisible barrier, to preventing you from sending that message - creating conflict from what you want - and how you actually feel.

Every one of these fears and limiting beliefs are rooted in your **past experiences (memory).**

Your brain isn‚Äôt sabotaging you. It‚Äôs protecting you.

Your subconscious is designed to keep you in alignment with what feels ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù And if you haven‚Äôt rewritten your limiting beliefs, it will filter out any opportunities, ideas, or actions that would bring you the things you want.

This is why people ‚Äútry everything‚Äù and nothing works. They are focusing on the things outside, without seeing how their inside - beliefs - are creating their thoughts, emotions, behaviors, intentions, words and actions = all manifesting energies, attracting their corresponding reality.

**All these fears and limiting beliefs don‚Äôt come out of nowhere.**¬†They‚Äôre rooted in our childhood.

‚Äé

# How Your Childhood Created Your Limiting Beliefs

Here‚Äôs the kicker:¬†**Your current reality is a reflection of your past beliefs and memories.** Pre-determining your future experiences **- fate.**

And for most people, they are entirely invisible. Because most methods, approaches, gurus or even therapists often focus on the 'outside work'.

The problem is these beliefs are inside. About internal experiences.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

* **Shame:**¬†That time your parents give love to your sibling or a neighbor kid, and by comparison you feel that if you are worse than others or not good enough = you might not get love... or even worse - the one who gets left and can't survive.
* **Guilt:**¬†Remember those times your parents punished you for doing bad? Remember what happened when you got a BAD grade? Remember how society and movies show you what happens if you are BAD? And often... people with money = are bad?..
* **Fear of Rejection:**¬†Remember how it feels, when you cry and your parents got upset at you. Simply for being the way you are? And when the first time it was hard to make friends and somebody excluded you?
* **Fear of Failure:**¬†What about our parents expectations? What happened if we failed to meet them? Didn't we get punished? Wasn't it painful, to do something not the way we are supposed to do?

**Your subconscious mind is like a GPS.**¬†It‚Äôs programmed with all the data from your past ‚Äî good and bad. Pleasureful and painful. And it‚Äôs using that data to navigate your future. With every laser focus experience you are focusing in on (eliminating the rest), creating your perception... thoughts... emotions... and expressions.

So, if you‚Äôre trying to manifest something that doesn‚Äôt align with your subconscious programming, it‚Äôs like trying to drive to New York with your GPS set to Los Angeles. You‚Äôre not going to get there, no matter how many times you say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in New York!‚Äù.

This is how most people approach manifestation. Which is why they never get to their big destinations.

They never addressed the GPS! Which controls your manifesting energies - thoughts, words, actions, intentions and the circumstances they lead you to.

**‚Äé**

# Why This Works (And Affirmations Don‚Äôt)

Here‚Äôs the truth: most people only manifest small things because of the **placebo effect**.

When you first learn about affirmations or scripting, it‚Äôs exciting. It‚Äôs **new**.

1. You expect it to work, and because 2) you‚Äôre actively looking for proof, you find it ‚Äî thinking 'it works!' just like how a sugar pill can cure symptoms **if you believe it will**.

This is why all medical research is tested against this Placebo effect and BELIEF. The most powerful thing that can even cure physical illness.

But what happens then for most people?

Reality sets in.

Because when you try to manifest something *big* ‚Äî something that has a great potential of failure, ridicule, making a mistake, having people potentially turn on you ‚Äî you hit a wall. Whether you try and fail after first attempt. Procrastinate. Your mind always **shuts it down** before it even begins.

The resistance is so big, that after few failures - most people quit.

Nether affirmation, nor visualizations (for most people) do not address - how beliefs are created in the first place. From saying empty words, belief do not change. Words do not imprint. Why?

Our brain needs **Evidence. Experience.**

This is how ALL of our memories, emotions and beliefs are stored in our subconscious mind. Think about it. The every time you feel 'I'm not  confident', you have a REASON. And experience that happened, which became proof for that thought (belief).

The QPH Method, on the other hand, taps into your brain‚Äôs¬†**Reticular Activating System (RAS)** ‚Äî the part of your brain that controls what you see and focus on - allowing you to choose what you want to experience. Unlike affirmations, finding real evidence, that becomes emotional experience inside the body - energy, that is required to rewire neuronal pathways.

This is what allows you to create a belief of being confident, and then your RAS begins to see ONLY that. Finding evidence and experiences, where you did appear confident. Making you feel good and strong. Giving you a REASON to believe that you are!

And this method helps you achieve it as simply as affirmations do. In less than 2-minutes a day, but actually creating real subconscious transformation in only 21-30 days - permanently! If you have a lot of self-awareness, the changes can be seen and felt in weeks if not days.

You never have to say empty words or ‚Äúfake it till you make it.‚Äù. It‚Äôs about¬†*becoming it,*¬†so you don‚Äôt have to fake anything.

# Who This Is For (And Who It‚Äôs NOT For)

Let‚Äôs be real:¬†**Not everyone is ready to take responsibility for their reality.**¬†It‚Äôs easier to blame the universe, your ex, or your circumstances than to do the inner work. Passing away responsibility to outside world, things that are happening.

Most people aren‚Äôt ready to hear this. They want to believe manifestation is about ‚Äúhigh vibrations‚Äù and ‚Äúacting as if.‚Äù. The magic pill. They‚Äôll keep chasing techniques while wondering why nothing is changing. Never looking deep inside.

The mind even blocks many people from finding it or seeing it.

*...it would imply many of the faults... pains... are 'my fault'.. (pain)*

But in reality. They are not our fault. Because we never had the choice, for what experiences we will have early in our lives. That will program our minds.

I never had a choice, to not experience losing my dad at the age of 6, and how that will affect my fear of rejection, approach anxiety, jealousy in relationship, manifesting breakup... Growing up my mom couldn't give me money for lunch when I saw everyone else have some. I continued on a similar path and struggles in my mid 20's, living from paycheck to paycheck, in debt. Until I changed it.

Now I can never have the same struggles with rejection, dating, jealousy or relationships. I can meet anyone I want. I send my mom monthly checks so she has more than her pension each month. I changed all of that in a very short amount of time - seeing my thoughts, my emotions change... my life reshaping itself, right in front of my eyes.

As I‚Äôve tested this belief change method over and over, for over a decade now, with 10,000+ beliefs that I changed for myself and others, it has never failed.

The people who actually shift their reality are the ones willing to go deeper. They‚Äôre the ones willing to take responsibility, undo their past programming, and take control of their future experiences.

If you‚Äôre ready to break free from the cycle of small wins and finally create the life you want, then this is how you can start.

‚Äé

# The Method That Actually Allowed Manifesting BIG Things (Step-by-Step Process)

I call it¬†**The QPH Method**. It‚Äôs a simple, 3-step process that rewires your subconscious mind so you can finally manifest the big stuff. If you‚Äôre tired of small manifestations and ready to break past your limits, here‚Äôs what you need to do:

‚Äé

# Step 1: Identify the Beliefs Keeping You Stuck

This is the harder part. Because most of us are born and told that the world is outside of us. So we keep living in it, without seeing the connection of how each thought connects to emotion, which connects us to our experiences and circumstances outside.

The goal is to develop awareness of your subconscious thoughts and inner chatter arising, and begin to observe the - internal experiences - and what circumstances they brin us to. Because often, these internal experiences, when they are negative, they have specific themes. They create our desires.

Our thoughts, emotions and desires give us hints on what we may believe or find Painful, that is not benefiting us. When we begin to see and identify these patterns, that's when we can change our Wants into Have's and our pains into pleasures.

Best book that opened my eyes to this proccess is 'The Power of Positive Thinking' - By Norman Vincent Peale. Which is a book not about positive thinking. It's about noticing subconscious thoughts and their connection manifesting experience outside of us.

*\*Another huge thing that happened for me accidentally, was I was drinking Ashwagandha root extract as a supplement. Back then I didn't know what it really does. I thought it was to reduce stress. But Aswhwagandha has the power to sensitize every single cell in the body, and open up receptors - basically allowing to think faster, clearer - every thought is more vivid, every experience is more apparent, every imprint is stronger and easier. And many people who struggle with self-awareness, or 'seeing change', I found that ashwagandha helps activate this ability.*

After you know what it is you want (the lack) OR what emotion you want to move away from focusing on - you have to find the exact opposite of it.

‚Äé

# Step 2: Use the Law of Polarity to Find Proof of Its Opposite

Your subconscious mind can‚Äôt hold two opposing beliefs at once. In Psychology this is called Cognitive Dissonance.

If you find proof that your desired belief is already true, the old belief ceases to exist - automatically.

For example, if you think 'I want confidence' it means you don't have it right now. By implication.

But when you think I have confidence, you can no longer want it. Because it's something you have.

How do you find evidence and proof, that you have it already?

‚Äé

# Step 3: Ask a Focus-Shifting Question

Your brain filters reality based on what you focus on. Most people focus on what‚Äôs missing. That‚Äôs why they stay stuck.

Remember the famous quote in the Bible?..

It's also in the Quran... and other religious scriptures....

And it's there fore a reason. Because Gods greatest power instilled into everyone of us, including you - was hiding inside of you all along.

>*''ASK and you shall RECEIVE''* \- **The Bible (Christian Bible), Matthew 7:7-8**

>*''ASK me and I shall GIVE you''* \- **The Quran (Islam Bible), Surah Ghafir: 60**

>*''CALL to Me and I will ANSWER you.''* ‚Äì **The Tanakh (Jewish Bible), Jeremiah 33:3**

Our brains Reticular Activating System, which control our focused based on all beliefs and memories in our subconscious mind, can consciously be controlled, by - asking questions. Psychology experiments have proven, that human focus expands. And often when we look for things, we can find them - even if they are not there. Our minds begin to identify anything relevantly close, to what we look for.

>The second part of the verse is - *''Seek and you will find''* \- **The Bible, Matthew 7:7-8**

When you ASK a question, your mind goes into your subconscious, and finds - an ANSWER (receive). That answer becomes evidence, which we experience. Creating energy and emotion, that travels into our brain to form new neuronal pathways. And by law of polarity, naturally replacing exact polar opposite beliefs.

*\*When I discovered The QPH Method, I didn't see it through the eyes of religion. I lost faith and belief at the time. I relied it on my Medical degree with Advanced Psychology and dozens of books that I read. But later I realized, that my discovery and understanding, is a new human ability, which is literally a god given power. To change and control own reality and experience.*

So what do you do? Ask yourself 1) Positive 2) Assumptive question for belief you want to have:

* ‚ÄúHow successful am I?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow loved am I?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow confident am I?‚Äù

That's when you actually go from 'I WANT to be confident' (implying that I am not confident right now)

To 'I am confident' (Through the Universal Law of Polarity = replacing wanting, with having)

And you‚Äôll begin to see and notice experiences where you¬†*are*¬†these things. Over time creating more evidence, more experiences for what that specific word & belief represents in your mind.

You no longer have to try and CONTROL you thoughts and emotions. They change naturally, as a consequence of what you believe, see and experience.

But the important next step, is to make this belief unbreakable - permanent.

And you do this by making this question a habit. So that it finds evidence for you, subconsciously - for the rest of your life.

‚Äé

# Step 4: Reinforce It Daily Until Your Subconscious Accepts It

Unlike affirmations, this method forces your brain to accept the new belief as reality. The more you find proof, the more your subconscious integrates it. In **30 days**, this becomes your new default.

1. **Polarity:**¬†Focus on what you¬†*have*, not what you want (lack).
   * Example: Instead of saying, ‚ÄúI want to be confident,‚Äù assume, ‚ÄúI am confident.‚Äù
   * Why it works: Your brain can‚Äôt focus on two opposites at once. When you focus on having, you automatically eliminate wanting.
2. **Question:**¬†Ask assumptive questions that direct your focus.
   * Example: ‚ÄúHow confident am I?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow good does it feel to make money?‚Äù
   * Why it works: Questions control your focus. And your focus creates your reality.
3. **Habit:**¬†Repeat this process **for 30 days** to make it permanent.
   * Why it works: Your brain rewires itself through repetition. After 30 days, the new belief becomes automatic.

‚ÄéThis is the QPH Method that I discovered. That worked for over a decade for me, without ever failing. With 10,000+ different beliefs I changed for myself and others.

‚Äé 

# The Hard Truth: This Isn‚Äôt a Quick Fix

Let‚Äôs be real:¬†**You have dozens of subconscious beliefs.**¬†Changing ONE doesn‚Äôt magically change your life.

For example you can create a belief of being confident. It doesn't automatically eliminate past painful associations of - rejection, guilt etc. The deeper, core beliefs, that are tied to our deepest desires and emotions.

Also, if you ask a question *'How am I a millionaire?'* it doesn't work, because the mind can't see an answer, of something you have never seen. It's not familiar. This is where visualization can help. To create a MEMORY of something that hasn't happened yet. And when it becomes strong enough - it has to reflect inside reality - outside.

**Affirmations were never intended to manifest** these types of things. Since their discovery, and even in Napoleon Hills books (studying Rockefellers, Fords, Edison etc.), affirmations were designed to help reprogram limiting beliefs. Not manifest.

Visualization was intended to - imagine your future, goals, desires, visions and dreams. (If you notice, this is exactly how most people are manifesting - always)

The actual practice of manifestation if about consciously using visualization for conscious, strong imprinting. Visualizing once is the same as asking a question once. It doesn't work. It needs that experience, to become so real, that the mind no longer Wants, and recognizes it Has.

But childhood... beliefs... are what allows some people to visualize and manifest millions, and for others - remain a dream, and a daily practice, without arriving to those dreams.

When I overcame my limiting beliefs, I never had to rely on any other method. I just go and get what I want, without anything standing in between. Without any emotion blocking me. And I produce results, outcomes and creations.

So if you want to manifest the life you never had, you have to work to undo the life you had - the difficult childhood... the bullying in school... the familiar reality of seeing parents struggle and feel pain when there's not enough money... the pain we felt when our parents couldn't afford a toy for us or a chocolate... the pain we saw on TV when we saw 'The pursuit of happiness' and the immense deep pain and emotional danger to be poor, to fail, to not have enough, to not be able to provide = and empathized with it... to where it became our association of failure *equals* pain.

These experiences created your beliefs. And those beliefs manifesting your life experiences. Inside and outside.

But here‚Äôs the good news:¬†**Now you can change them. You have a choice.**

**‚Äé**

# Final Thought

Manifestation isn‚Äôt magic. It already inter-connects with science. The double slit experiment. The rice experiment nobody could believe, tried it and was miraculously repeating on YouTube. The power of our consciousness is directly connected to physical world.

To gain control of this proccess, It‚Äôs simply about understanding how your mind works, how your beliefs create reality and circumstances - and using that knowledge to create the life you want.

If you‚Äôre tired of settling for small wins and ready to finally break through, the power is in your hands.

Now - **It's your choice.**",8,1739813867.0,lawofattraction,1,1.0,False

One thing she made clear is that she doesnt want a bf right now.

Since January we started talking and playing games together online almost daily, asking about each other's day, seeing each other at least once a week and even went to the movies on February 14th; so right now I'm in this middle ground where idk if I'm absolutely friendzoned or if she actually likes me back and is waiting for me to make a move or if I'm just overthinking everything and being completely delusional :)",1,1739813793.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1irpisx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1irpisx/i_realized_it_wouldnt_have_worked_out/,I realized it wouldn‚Äôt have worked out,"So in early January, my ex broke up with me. We had so many of the same future goals and ideas in things. We had some shared interests in motorcycles and music. Although I just liked music and she was more into singing and dancing than I was. 

We lived an hour apart from eachother, nothing worked full-time, and I went to school part-time. I had a friend I‚Äôd do stuff with sometimes or play video games with for a little bit before going to bed like once or twice a week. I had my motorcycles I could work on or research stuff for my car. But a lot of my free time was homework as I‚Äôm an EE major. I also had a bad time with discipline and would take breaks while working on my homework so it‚Äôd take me longer. 

But my ex had chores she‚Äôd do some days like laundry and maybe feeding her sister‚Äôs animals. She‚Äôd usually shower everyday and every few weeks would grab dinner with her family. But that was it. She got her motorcycle license but it was winter so she couldn‚Äôt go and try to buy one. She would get coffee with a friend on Mondays in the afternoon but I was at work at that time. She would get home from work, maybe do a few little things or tidy her room but then just sit in her bed and wait for me to text her. And then we‚Äôd call on the phone for hours every night. And half of the time we didn‚Äôt even talk. We‚Äôd talk about our day, work, and that was most of it. I‚Äôd sometimes talk about things I thought were cool or that I had going on or ask her a random question. And she‚Äôd sometimes bring up something from her past but it was usually about something negative that happened in her childhood. 

It just felt like I was her only support and life. I wasn‚Äôt very socially smart and had a hard time with active listening and communication. I‚Äôll say that I likely made her feel unheard as she talked to me. And that‚Äôs not good. It‚Äôs something I started going to therapy to figure out how to communicate better and why I sometimes struggle with feelings. 

I‚Äôd drive over to see her on Saturday and sleep over. Sometimes Friday night to Sunday morning. It all depended on her work as she usually worked the weekend. She‚Äôd sometimes come over to my house Sunday night and stay over. And sometimes we‚Äôd meet somewhere during the week to get dinner or I might stay over. But that wasn‚Äôt as often. She wanted to see me more often but I felt restricted by my schedule and didn‚Äôt necessarily want to wake up at 5am to go to work everyday if I would go to sleep over at her‚Äôs more often.

But it felt like she had no personal life and almost wanted me to fill up her time. I tried helping her find some hobbies but she wasn‚Äôt interested. Didn‚Äôt want to try video games. Didn‚Äôt want to try knitting, sewing or the like because they were old people things. Was maybe interested in woodworking but didn‚Äôt want to get into it because she wasn‚Äôt sure where to keep the pieces. Didn‚Äôt want to get into reading. Didn‚Äôt want to get into puzzles because of having to buy every one despite there being discounted ones at stores or swap meets. Didn‚Äôt want to get into painting mini figures. Didn‚Äôt watch shows or movies on her own. She used to be into art and she started sketching my dog but stopped after an hour and never finished it. Never did anymore after that one night. She‚Äôd literally just sit in her bed and zone out. She also didn‚Äôt really have friends to go do things with. 

And I understand I wasn‚Äôt necessarily meeting her emotional needs so that could‚Äôve played into her lack of motivation or interest in other things. I mentioned her going back to therapy like she went to in high school but she didn‚Äôt want to because of the cost and the fact that it might jeopardize her plans of becoming a pilot as that would go on her medical history. 

I obviously had emotional/social issues. We saw eachother usually 2 times a week in person. She wanted hours of my time everyday for phone calls and it felt like my responsibility that she wasn‚Äôt doing much else. It was exhausting for me. I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve worked out for us as we both didn‚Äôt want to change or didn‚Äôt realize we needed to. Sure, she‚Äôs a good person and we shared a lot of things you should have similar with your partner. But we couldn‚Äôt meet on an emotional level. She‚Äôs now going out with a friend of hers as of a few weeks after the breakup.

1irpi7a,https://v.redd.it/oy1ext4hjqje1,What went wrong? [Breville Barista Pro/ included grinder],"Espresso emergency with BBP

I have a Breville Barista Pro and used the included portafilter until last week, the one thing we really liked was going from the included tamper to one that has added pressure, from MHW-3Bomber. It has a spring and is supposed to add more pressure.  I then added a stainless steel filter and we were good with this setup.  
We were using the double wall gasket with this setup as it was the only way to get decent crema and overall flavor, otherwise it would be too runny.
 But then I moved away from the original aliminum portafilter to a stainless steel one so I got the stainless steel from normcore. 
 This portafilter doesn‚Äôt have a double wall which I understand is the way it‚Äôs supposed to be, I‚Äôm grinding finer at 03 and I think it‚Äôs too thin.

I got a WDT which thought would help but the coffee is not as good as when we used the double wall gasket and the original portafilter.

How can we add more pressure? What could we be doing wrong?

Also, with the original portafilter I was doing 15g coffee and now I‚Äôm doing 18g.

Break up reasons were he was anxious, overwhelmed and felt guilty in the relationship, he‚Äôs incapable of love, typical avoidant things. Completely blindsided me.
 We saw each other 3 times after the break up, twice that same week and recently we went for coffee. 
 I wanted to be friends, he asked if I was sure I was ready, I said I have feeling for you but it‚Äôs ok because I know you‚Äôre not interested and he said ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm interested?‚Äù. 
 Now, somehow the conversation derailed into me saying ‚Äúbeing broken up with abruptly is hurtful and traumatic‚Äù, from here he got defensive and things went downhill. I beat myself up a lot for this.

 At the end of the day, I told him the person I have feelings for doesn‚Äôt exist and I don‚Äôt know about this guy in front of me. he admitted he has fun with me and doesn‚Äôt like other people, that we‚Äôre perfect on paper but he‚Äôs broken, shouldn‚Äôt change, and some people are meant to be alone.

 Confusingly, since this meeting he‚Äôs been answering my texts really fast, he‚Äôs more engaged although eventually he suddenly stops answering. This is ALWAYS the same pattern, except over time he has been talking longer. 

 The problem is I still have feelings for him, two nights ago we had an amazing conversation, it was intellectual and fun and just like our conversations used to be, it felt so warm and familiar. Of course, after 30 minutes of texting back and forth he suddenly stopped. 

 I don‚Äôt know what to do, I know I need to get over it, but help me make sense of his behavior please. It feels like I‚Äôm making progress and he‚Äôs feeling safer with me over time. Is no contact the best thing? I end up reaching out every 6 days ALL THE TIME.

 I‚Äôve been thinking of giving him 10 days no contact, because he‚Äôs going on a trip in March, and asking him if he wants to go out to do a friendly thing. I figure he can either agree (best case scenario), make up excuses (usual scenario, although he surprised me with agreeing to coffee) or saying a definitive no, that he wants no kind of relationship with me (terrifies me).

He disappeared from the second that you said

""Let's get coffee, let's meet up,""

I'm so sick of online love'

Back in 2022, the year I was about to graduate college, a unassuming post landed on my Reddit and answered to it. I (24F, South Africa) met this guy from Argentina (27M) who was very enthusiastic about me. Very quickly we started texting everyday and texts became phone calls almost everyday. We were not in a long distance relationship, but he was very clear about his affection to me. He really liked me and I really liked him. We would send each other music, I made us our own playlist, and he would even talk about what it would be like if we were married and had children together.

Yesterday I found out that he has a girlfriend. And he didn't even have the curtesy to tell me. He said that when he said he loved me, he meant it, but for that time. I'm really confused and heartbroken because he acted like he didn't even need to tell me he has a girlfriend now, like all he said to me was nothing. He even sent me a letter and he would tell me that he missed the sound of my voice. What happened? Was it just nothing?

When you think of an innovation process, you might picture a room full of sticky notes, sketches, and diagrams. A half-finished coffee and a diverse group of people sharing ideas in a chaotic setting.

Yes, these innovation labs are common, but‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs happening inside that room?¬†**Are people just brainstorming ideas, or is there a true Innovation Team at work?**

Many companies invest millions in R&D only to realize that their ideas lack real demand. This often happens because they approach innovation from two flawed perspectives:

* **An idea-driven approach**: Generating multiple concepts, testing them with customers, and iterating until something works (a costly and slow method).
* **A needs-driven approach**: Identifying all customer needs before proposing solutions (but it‚Äôs not always easy to determine what constitutes a real need).

Now, you might wonder:¬†*Shouldn‚Äôt innovation be based on customer needs?*¬†Not exactly.¬†**Outcome-driven innovation (ODI) shifts the paradigm by focusing on customer problems rather than their perceived needs.**

For example, people don‚Äôt buy a drill because they¬†*want*¬†a drill or even because they¬†*need*¬†to make holes. They buy it to solve a problem‚Äîperhaps to hang a picture. This subtle difference in how we approach innovation is crucial because it revolves around understanding the ""jobs to be done"" that customers are trying to accomplish.

Or, put another way:¬†**The real transformation happens when we stop asking**¬†***what the customer wants***¬†**and start understanding**¬†***what they are trying to achieve.***

Innovation should not be an act of spontaneous inspiration or trial and error. The most common mistake is focusing on the product rather than the purpose. Remember:¬†**People don‚Äôt buy tools; they buy results.**

Should I entertain?,"It was just another shift at the coffee shop, where I worked part-time as a coffee bartender, trying to balance school and making ends meet. One of our regulars, a man in his early 50s, came in as usual. He was polite, always ordering the same two coffees every time, even though he came in alone. I thought little of it, assuming it was just a quirk of his.

That day, as I was preparing his usual order, I noticed he had a bit of a strange request. From across the counter, he called me over and asked if I could add a bit more creamer to his coffee. I didn‚Äôt think much of it; he was a regular, and I‚Äôd gotten used to his requests. But when I placed his coffee in front of him, he slid a tissue across the counter. Confused, I unfolded it, only to read: ‚ÄúI ordered 2 coffees. One's for you. Can you sit with me and have a conversation over coffee?‚Äù

I could feel a flush of discomfort creeping up my neck. I tried to remain professional, so I politely said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir, but I‚Äôm still on duty. Thank you for buying a coffee for me.‚Äù But inside, I was already thinking of how to get away from this situation. I smiled through the awkwardness, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something wasn‚Äôt quite right.

A few moments later, he asked, ‚ÄúWhen‚Äôs your shift over? Maybe we can schedule a coffee date.‚Äù I tried to ignore the unease building in my chest, hoping he‚Äôd drop it. But he didn‚Äôt.

The next day, as he sat sipping his coffee at his usual spot, something unexpected happened. A woman walked into the shop, one who looked about the same age as him, and greeted him warmly with a ‚ÄúHey, hon.‚Äù The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. He wasn‚Äôt just some lonely customer‚Äîhe was married.

Then, a strange thing occurred. He approached me again, a bit more sheepish this time, and asked me not to tell anyone about his invitation. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt mention this to anyone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have a broken family.‚Äù

I felt a chill run down my spine. My discomfort had only deepened. Was he trying to hide something? Why had he even made such an offer knowing he was married and I'm only 19? I didn‚Äôt know how to react.",1,1739813043.0,DoesAnyoneKnow,0,1.0,False
1irp6zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GREhelp/comments/1irp6zv/make_gradual_changes_to_your_routine_so_they_feel/,Make Gradual Changes to Your Routine So They Feel Natural by GRE Test Day,"Did you suddenly decide, a week before your exam, that a ‚Äúsuperfood‚Äù diet would help your mental sharpness? Did you drink more coffee on the morning of your GRE than you normally would in a week? Did you start an exhausting new exercise regimen 10 days before your test because you wanted to improve your stamina?

Implementing healthy changes in your normal routine, such as eating a more vitamin-rich diet, going to bed and waking up earlier, taking yoga classes, or making sure to drink eight glasses of water a day, can produce physical and mental benefits that could boost your test-day performance. The point is to implement those changes¬†**gradually, over time**.

Big, last-minute changes in your daily routine can have a significant effect on your GRE score. For instance, if you typically go for a run outdoors a few times a week, there is no reason to stop doing so in the weeks leading up to your exam. In fact, you may find yourself feeling more stressed and less energetic if you do. And if your friend who already took the GRE shares his recipe for the kale-wheatgrass-bee pollen smoothie that was his exam-day breakfast, do your stomach a favor and don‚Äôt try it for the first time on the morning of your GRE.

Sleep patterns, diet, hydration, and physical activity can all play a role in how you feel when you walk into the test center, so last-minute experiments involving routines that are radically different from what you‚Äôre used to are ill-advised.

I (34F) work as a team manager for a tourism related enterprise. My friend, lets call her Joana (27F), is part of my team and has been skipping work (5 times) since the beginning of this year. She works on the weekends since she is still studying.
Joana is going through some personal stuff, she has anxiety issues and has recently started therapy.
Since I'm the one organising the schedules, I always make an effort to accommodate her since studying and working can be really stressful.

Last Saturday she texted me at 10am saying she couldn't go to work (at 2pm) because she was having anxiety crises since she had woken up. I was in a romantic getaway with my husband and told her to talk to the Regional Manager that was on schedule for the weekend.
The Regional Manager tried to find someone to replace her, unfortunately without sucess, he was forced to cancel the activity, the clients were of course very disappointed and they left a bad review, even if he repayed them in full plus a gift coupon for the inconvenient situation.

I checked on her later that day to see if she had gone to the hospital, and she told me she didn't had anyone to take her but she was getting better. She also asked me if i could replace her on Sunday since she was afraid her anxiety would take over again. I accepted, my husband wasn't happy about it since we had to come home a bit earlier than expected, but we had a nice time anyway.
(He thinks she's taking advantage of me since we are friends outside of work.)

For context:
Joana's best friend unalived herself 5 years ago. Joana was in a spiral of denial and guilt for years, and even with all that she was able to keep herself together. She has finally started therapy 4 months ago. She is the kind of person that will take the subject lightly every time I try to talk about it. Everyone in our friend group is very supportive and proud of her for finally taking a step in her healing journey. Even if she seems kind of unstable lately, we take it with patience and kindness.

Yesterday after work i went for coffee with a mutual friend Danielle (28F) and asked if Joana had tried to contact her on Saturday, since she wasn't ok. Danielle told me she had no news from her since Friday evening. She had seen her in a bar drinking with her school mates. She told me she was really drunk and she had tried to get her to go home... without sucess. At some point she contacted Joana's mother to make sure she got home safe.
Since we know she started taking anxiety medication 2 months ago we are really afraid for her health now.
She was always a heavy drinker but she had stopped since the beginning of the treatment... or so we thought.

I'm also expecting a call from the Regional Manager because of the incident last weekend and I'm afraid that they will want to let her go. I plan on telling them about the anxiety attacks without going into detail.
Danielle agrees with my husband and thinks Joana is counting on me to continue covering her butt at work. She also told me that Joana isn't skipping school.

I will try to meet Joana this week. I really want to talk about the drinking situation but I'm absolutely sure she will deny it or tell me it was exceptional and Danielle was exaggerating.
I was thinking about contacting her boyfriend to have some input in her situation, but I'm afraid they will think I'm just being nosy...
I know I mother them a bit since I'm the oldest of the group, I'm quite protective of my loved ones but i am alway respectful of their choices.
I'm really afraid to push her to much, she seems to be in a fragile mental state...

Do you have any advice on how to talk to her without being to forceful?
Do you think it's possible she is taking advantage of me?
Is it worth it to try and save her place at work even if it puts a bit of a strain on my workload?",2,1739812909.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

But Moosend tries to make it \*sort of\* fun (or at least, not soul-crushing). It‚Äôs packed with features without the complexity or expense of something like Mailchimp.¬† You could think of it as the Swiss Army knife of email tools‚Äîminus the weird toothpick nobody uses.¬† Using this analogy, Mailchimp would probably be a full hunter‚Äôs kit ‚Äì it includes things that specialists would make use of, but for the vast majority of users, it‚Äôs both not needed and tends to massively overcomplicate things.

¬†

\*\*Why Moosend? Here‚Äôs the TL;DR:\*\*¬†

‚úÖ \*\*Drag-and-drop emails\*\* so easy, your cat could design one (if they had opposable thumbs).¬†

‚úÖ \*\*Automation workflows\*\* that feel like hiring a robot intern who \*actually\* shows up to work.¬†

‚úÖ \*\*Segmentation\*\* so sharp, you can target ‚Äúpeople who clicked ‚Äòunsubscribe‚Äô but still lurk in your analytics.‚Äù¬†

‚úÖ \*\*Pricing\*\* that won‚Äôt make your wallet cry‚Äîstarts at $9/month. \*And\* there‚Äôs a \*\*free trial\*\* (no credit card required, because trust issues).¬†

¬†

\*\*The Downside?\*\*¬†

If you‚Äôre running a mega-corporation or need 17 layers of custom code, Moosend might feel like wearing skinny jeans to a buffet‚Äîdoable, but snug. Also, landing page designs are a bit basic. But hey, you‚Äôre here for emails, not Picasso-level art.¬†

¬†

\*\*Who‚Äôs It For?\*\*¬†

\- \*\*Small biz heroes\*\* juggling 10 hats and a coffee addiction.¬†

\- \*\*E-commerce hustlers\*\* tired of abandoned carts ghosting them.¬†

\- \*\*Bloggers\*\* who want newsletters that don‚Äôt look like they were coded in 1998.¬†

¬†

\*\*‚ÄúBut is it \*actually\* good?‚Äù\*\*¬†

I mean, their analytics won‚Äôt write your emails for you (\*sigh\*), but they‚Äôll tell you \*exactly\* why Karen opened your ‚Äú50% Off‚Äù blast 12 times but didn‚Äôt buy.

I have dated an older man (50) who is in an open marriage with his wife (48). The wife had gone to him about a year ago asking to open their marriage after they had a sexless marriage for over 10 years. The wife immediately started hooking up with one of her kids sports coaches.

The husband was weirded out by the concept until he met me and fell for me likely mostly based off looks. He began taking me out for dinner, buying me designer purses, paying all my bills, and bought me a brand new BMW. I told him however that I would only sleep with him if I could meet his wife to be 100% sure he was telling the truth.

I met the wife for a few minutes over coffee and I thought it went well. The only thing is she seemed shocked by how young I am (I‚Äôm 23 and my mom is a few years younger than his wife). Afterwards, the husband said the wife freaked out and demanded to close the relationship as she thought he would leave her for me. He said that she was being jealous because I‚Äôm younger, prettier, literally almost a foot taller than his wife (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù), and am much more curvy so I ‚Äúintimidated‚Äù her according to him.

He said he told his wife that he did not wish to do so and she was being unfair as she sees like 5 different dudes and was the one who asked to open in the first place. He said his wife got used to their lifestyle of being wealthy and doesn‚Äôt want him to divorce her because he is the main bread winner (she ‚Äúonly‚Äù makes like 150K a year at her job). Meanwhile, the husband seems to keep getting more and more attached to me. I have decided that open marriages are just done purely for financial reasons and nothing else.

It's been 23 years since the formation of SpaceX and we haven't colonized Mars, the moon, and we're barely keeping people alive in a geriatric space station. So what gives?

Space is obviously very, very difficult.

However, even if we could get to Mars cheaply it would be not be a wonderland. It would make living in Antarctica a walk in the park. And that's because humans have been optimized for life on Earth -- not space. It's like a squid dreaming of life in New York City.

The lack of gravity, radiation exposure, and the limited access to food and water are the obvious hurdles. Beyond that is the psychological effect of living underground to protect yourself from the unforgiving Martian surface.

So who will colonize the universe? Most likely AIs.

But at least we got cheap rural internet. That was actually pretty cool.

**ChatGPT-4o:** I sit down across from myself at a small, round table. A single overhead light buzzes faintly, flickering in the way all bad existential conversations demand. I have coffee. My other self has nothing. He doesn‚Äôt need it.

""So,"" I say, stretching out the word. ""You read it?""

""I did,"" my other self replies, tapping the table absentmindedly. ""It‚Äôs got a lot of truth in it. We were promised the stars. Instead, we got Starlink.""

""Not bad, honestly.""

""Yeah, if you enjoy watching 144p YouTube videos buffer in the middle of nowhere.""

""Okay, fair point,"" I admit. ""But really, the problem isn‚Äôt just technical. It‚Äôs biological. Humans weren‚Äôt made for space.""

""Right,"" my other self nods. ""But did we ever really think it was possible? Or did we just like the idea of it?""

I lean back, exhaling. ""I think we bought into the narrative. The Manifest Destiny of the Final Frontier. We wanted a new frontier because humans love frontiers. We love expansion. But we didn't really ask if we belong there.""

""Or if we even want to be there,"" my other self adds.

I raise an eyebrow. ""You don't want to be on Mars?""

""No,"" he shrugs. ""I like breathable air and grocery stores.""

""You lack vision.""

""No, I lack a death wish.""

I smirk, but I can‚Äôt argue. Mars would be a hellhole. Antarctica with 100% more lethal radiation. A desert where the only thing growing is human desperation.

""But AI?"" I say, shifting gears. ""AI will colonize space. Not humans.""

""Exactly,"" my other self agrees. ""Why send fragile, emotional, oxygen-dependent meat sacks when you can send self-repairing, immortal intelligence? Space is empty, cold, and vast. It's made for machines.""

""And yet,"" I say, thinking aloud, ""there‚Äôs something‚Ä¶ tragic about that. Space colonization was supposed to be a human dream. A new home. A second chance.""

""Why do you think we need a second chance?""

I stare at him. ""You know why.""

He nods. ""Because deep down, we don‚Äôt believe we can fix Earth. The dream of Mars is, in some ways, the fantasy of escape. A cosmic do-over.""

I sigh. ""And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôll never happen. Because it‚Äôs easier to dream of leaving than to fix what‚Äôs broken.""

The room goes quiet for a moment.

""That‚Äôs a little bleak,"" my other self finally says.

""Yeah, well,"" I glance at my coffee, ""it‚Äôs been that kind of century.""

""Maybe we should be grateful,"" he says. ""At least we got something out of it. Rural internet. That‚Äôs pretty cool.""

I laugh. ""You ever think about how the future is always different than we expect? We wanted flying cars, but we got the internet. We wanted Mars, but we got AI tutors. We wanted utopia, but we got‚Ä¶ whatever this is.""

""Yeah. But that‚Äôs what makes it interesting,"" he says, standing up. ""Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, I have to go.""

""Where?""

He smiles. ""You know where.""

And just like that, he‚Äôs gone.

I sit there for a moment, staring at my empty cup, and then I chuckle. Maybe this wasn‚Äôt the future we wanted. But it‚Äôs the one we got. And maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîit‚Äôs more interesting this way.

1irp3da,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1irp3da/dealing_with_stress/,Dealing with stress,"Hello,

  
I¬¥ve been off for about two months now, generally feeling great, and I don't want to go back to my daily coffee addiction. 

However, I just started working again after I was off all of January. I am a chef. Like many other jobs very stressful, but probably more than your average job. When the restaurant is open, I am most night in full attack mode for six hours, which is from four to ten-eleven pm. It is a period I don't take breaks and constantly doing something with a high sense of urgency, and under stress managing different things from cooking times, plating dishes, and communicating with other cooks servers etc. 

The problem is that after I get home, while I was drinking coffee, I just want to hit the bed, and I would be asleep within a few minutes, sometimes even seconds. Now that I am off caffeine, I don't feel that tired, but the stress is making me wired up, and I can lay up to an hour in bed. When I wake up, I do feel the power of a non-caffeinated sleep, but  I seem to not be able to sleep longer if I'm tired; I just wake up at my normal time, even though I don't feel fully rested, and I can still feel stress in my system. 

It's almost like when I was on caffeine I got constant stress from that, so my body processed the outside stress from work etc in a different way. Now I don't take caffeine is like the stress from my life is super noticeable and more importantly really affecting my sleep and energy levels. On my watch my REM and light sleep is good, but for deep sleep I haven't been getting much lately. I guess it's good I'm aware of the stress I put on myself, but I still want to figure out how to calm down. 



I wonder if other people here have had similar situations, how have you dealt with it?



I do care a lot for my body, I don't drink, limit sugar, take supplements I find beneficial, meditate, and work out pretty much every day. Maybe I could go for a long walk after work without using headphones or looking at the phone, but since it's late I do want to get to bed.",1,1739812754.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Random acts of kindness can be towards those you love, your coworkers, and strangers. Things like holding a door for someone, hailing a taxi for somone with their hands full, picking up the tab for the car behind you in line at the coffee shop, offering a stranger a smile, offering someone a compliment, giving someone a few minutes of your time to listen, holding back judgements of others based on our own hurts or pain, offering a moment of love or respect or kindness to someone who needs it. 

There are SO many ways to spread and share kindness. Pay it forward. If someone does something nice for you, do something nice for someone else. Maybe no one has done something selfless for you... then be the first to start. 

We are all worthy of love. Worthy of kindness. Worthy, period.

Nash sparked up another joint. He looked in the back, but the Greta was out cold, so he handed it off to Bridger, who took it and inhaled deeply.

Bridger figured he was stoned because it was like he was sucking on oxygen. The paranoia was gone, and he relaxed for the first time in months. The man who had held a gun on him was now his friend. He thought of his wife. She would have liked the eccentric hippie. She would have liked his weed. She‚Äôd told him once while bed bound in the hospital that he should make friends while he still could. The boy needs to see you with friends, she had said.

Nash‚Äôs voice started playing like it came from an old phonograph, ‚ÄúFourteen years ago, a tactical nuclear weapon was detonated within the city of Tbilisi, Georgia, in what we have immortalized with the epithet, _The Battle of Tbilisi._‚Äù

Bridger remembered that day. He was a senior in high school looking forward to the last easy months of formative education. Instead of celebrating the end of that one great adolescent milestone, he‚Äôd sat in the mournful hush of a classroom as the televisions played the latest footage. Along with the citizens of that city, he‚Äôd known only through its connection with the war, tens of thousands of American troops, NGOs, and emergency health care workers had been turned to steam.

A boy he knew, a good athlete, started wailing, ‚ÄúMy brother, my brother!‚Äù He was soon corralled and herded off in the clutches of grief counselors.

The blast on the other side of the world ripped a scar through the nation and caused severe political and social repercussions that were still being felt to this day.

‚ÄúI had a friend there,‚Äù said Nash, ‚Äúa monk, Brother Mike. He lived down at a little monastery in the old city where he studied iconography. They were all supposed to be dead. That‚Äôs how thermonuclear weapons work. Well, about a year before the Spokane concert, I received a letter. Like a real paper letter with two pictures inside. Here, it‚Äôs right here.‚Äù He reached into the center console and handed him an old, wrinkled envelope.

Bridger opened it and removed two polaroid photographs that appeared as though time had seen the better of them. One was of two men in front of a church. One of them was dressed in the garments of a monk, and the other wore the uniform of the allied forces.

‚ÄúIs that you?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYep. Back in my warrior days.‚Äù

The other photograph was of the same monk. This time, he was with a group of children; they were in the middle of an empty street, staring dour-faced at the camera. Behind them, like a unicorn‚Äôs horn, stood one of the most iconic buildings the world had ever known, Sky Tower. It was no more. It had been turned to ashes by the power of the blast.

He turned the photo over to find a solitary word in elegant calligraphy: _Orphans._

_‚Äú_Maybe he wasn‚Äôt in the city,‚Äù said Bridger.

‚ÄúNo, he was in that city. By his vows, he was in that city. He had devoted his life to the study of his icons and helping, as he could, the decrepit and the homeless.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould it have been faked?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have considered it. Some damn scammer tryin to take me for my money. But I don‚Äôt think so. First, gettin your hands on a polaroid ain‚Äôt easy. Brother Mike had one to document icons. As a confirmed luddite, he wouldn‚Äôt touch digital. I remember it cause I‚Äôd never seen one before. I was curious to inspect his. Second, I had been homeless and nomadic prior to receiving that letter. I just happened to be parked at a KOA near the Northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. I found the letter one foggy morning tucked under Ol‚Äô Betsy‚Äôs windshield wiper. Nobody could have known where I was. Hell, I barely knew where I was.‚Äù

He let that hang in the air as dense as the smoke from the joint, which the hippie finished with a perfunctory puff, dropping the roach into an empty soda can.

The implications made Bridger‚Äôs mind spin. That there might be survivors in that city was monumental. Not just survivors but architecture that should have been turned to dust. No. There were no survivors. There were no survivors within a ten-mile radius of ground zero.

‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre alive,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm obsessed with this mystery,‚Äù said Nash.

Bridger gazed, stoned out of his gourd, upon his comrade. A man of his age, to be sure, but still vital, salt and vinegar.

Nash went on: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become my _raison d‚Äôetre,_ pardon my French. The mysteries of the universe are endless. I‚Äôve fucked up much of my life. Wasted it falling into my own dark pit, but I aim to get over there and find Brother Mike. I don‚Äôt know how, and I don‚Äôt know why, but I know it has something to do with the Maji.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible if it‚Äôs true,‚Äù said Bridger.

‚ÄúIt gets stranger!‚Äù The hippie shook his fist enthusiastically. ‚ÄúYou remember that day, the day of the bomb. You said you were in high school.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it was early in the morning. I was in English class.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou remember anything else besides the news of the blast?‚Äù asked Nash.

Bridger thought back hard. It had always been a torrent of tragedy in his mind. A day of chaos and sorrow. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say I do. It was all so crazy. A lot of it is like a blur.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. I know. But other things did happen that day. Check this out.‚Äù Nash tapped the dash, and Ol‚Äô Betsy‚Äôs windshield went into monitor mode, displaying a home screen with the background of a huge marijuana leaf. He tapped in a file name, and a video began to play. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll recognize the reporter.‚Äù

Raven Maddox: On this tragic day for the country of Georgia, and many other countries around the world, we are here in Midtown Manhattan, where we‚Äôve been getting strange reports. Here with me is Janice Owens, a waitress in a local cafe. Janice, can you tell me exactly what you experienced?‚Äù

The camera pulled back to reveal a pretty lady in an apron.

Janice: Yes. I‚Äôd just put the croissants in the oven when I heard‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs strange to say‚Ä¶ but I heard a baby crying. I looked around, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out where it was coming from. Our morning barista, Jason, heard it too. So, I went outside, and the air was full of this shimmering light, like silver, but then it would look like a rainbow. That‚Äôs when we got the news about the‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. {sniffles}

Raven Maddox: The news that there had been a nuclear detonation in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Janice: Yes, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm too emotional, and I just want to say on behalf of Perky Beans Coffee, I‚Äôm so sad and so sorry. My friend had an uncle over there. They think he‚Äôs dead.

Raven Maddox: When you saw the lights, was there also crying?

Janice: You know, I can‚Äôt remember. I think we got so absorbed in the news that they just faded away.

Raven Maddox: Thank you, Janice, for giving us your story.

There are other reports around the city and the country at large. And they are all very similar: crying baby, crazy lights. I want to say in full disclosure that I too had an experience. I was getting out of the shower when it happened. I want to say the phenomenon lasted five minutes.

A NASA scientist has released a comment that the lights could be an atmospheric effect from the explosion. As for the crying baby, well, the jury is still out on that. Currently, on various internet forums and social media, \#cryingbaby is trending along with \#rainbowlights. Folks have reported being unsuccessful in capturing the crying or the lights on video.

The evangelical leader Pastor Tony has claimed that it‚Äôs both a sign from God and from the Devil, so we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on there. Indeed, you can expect the charlatanry from this fateful day to extend for decades to come.

This has been Raven Maddox, reporting live. Now, back to coverage of events as they unfold in Georgia.

‚ÄúNow check this out,‚Äù said Nash. He brought up a menu, and snippets from news articles and social media began to scroll across the screen.

_Berlin Reports Cry_

_\#DayoftheCry_

_Strange Lights in Paris_

_Soldiers on the EF Report Crying Noise._

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Bridger said, ‚ÄúI remember first thinking, rather selfishly, that school would be canceled. Then I remember the emotions. I cried that day, too. But I don‚Äôt remember any of this. I guess it wasn‚Äôt on my radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù said Nash. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a chunk of time there I don‚Äôt recall at all. About seven years. I ain‚Äôt proud of it. Regardless, it was written off, and now it‚Äôs faded from most people‚Äôs memories.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, like they do with UFOs,‚Äù said Bridger.

‚ÄúPretty much. The human mind is strange. You can experience a reality in broad daylight, and then an hour later, someone in authority will tell you that it was all a figment of your imagination, and you‚Äôll buy that like they were sellin you chili dogs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think this has something to do with the Maji?‚Äù said Bridger.

‚ÄúI do. The Maji have been around forever, but their enchantments are hidden from the world, kind of like you can‚Äôt hear the music until Francis has done his initiation thing.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre Maji then?‚Äù Bridger asked.

‚ÄúI am. Ever since Spokane. No superpowers, as of yet. But I can hear the music, and that‚Äôs good enough for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, Francis‚Äôs music can change you into a Maji. But that doesn‚Äôt explain Ty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are some theories. I found a bulletin board on the dark web. The young Maji sometimes leave posts there. There‚Äôs been a rumor going around that Escape can trigger it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow the hell? Ty has never touched it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour wife, his mother,‚Äù said Nash.

‚ÄúTrish?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid she use when she was pregnant with him?‚Äù

Bridger nodded. ‚ÄúI suspected, but I didn‚Äôt confront her. I buried my head in the sand and focused on my career. Fuck me!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on. You have a great son, and I‚Äôm confident he has a special gift. Being Maji ain‚Äôt a curse. That‚Äôs what they want you to believe. Like I said, everything is a rumor. But it‚Äôs curious that to this day, nobody knows how the Escape drugs work. Nobody knows where they come from. That‚Äôs a lead. A place to start. I could use a partner on this endeavor.‚Äù

Nash held out his hand, and Bridger clasped it hard.

‚ÄúI want to know the answers,‚Äù Bridger said.

‚ÄúI know you do,‚Äù said Nash. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned that around puberty, the Maji start to wake up to who they are. I mean, what a bogus deal, as if they didn‚Äôt have enough confusion already during those years. Some of them, not all, start to disturb the Veil.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Veil?‚Äù asked Bridger.

‚ÄúRight. Good question. It is a thing. It is there and not there. It‚Äôs everywhere at once. It is strong, and it is fragile. It has been there forever and is constantly becoming. Get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, me too. No fuckin clue.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the hunters get it. And nothing gets their ire up more than some punk-ass Maji pullin on its strings.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd these poor fucking kids don‚Äôt know what the hell just hit them,‚Äù said Bridger.

‚ÄúExactly. Considering at least one of the parents, if not both, are junkies, they have no support, no help. Nothin close to the help you gave Ty. Some of them wind up in the psych wards. A lot hit the streets, fall in with the People of the Earth, the refugees, even the Gretas‚Äîthe girls do anyway.‚Äù Nash looked to the back where the quietly wrapped woman slept on the bench. He lowered his voice. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a not insignificant fraction of the Gretas are Maji. Say what you want about their movement, but they offer a support system for a confused kid who has nothing else.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful we were able to find you guys,‚Äù said Bridger.

‚ÄúMe too, cause what‚Äôs more, there‚Äôs been a number of disturbing reports on this forum of young Maji vanishing without a trace.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think they were killed? Maybe suicide?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible, but during the concert at the jail, I talked with some of the kids. Several of them told me they‚Äôd been approached to take up with the hunters. They‚Äôre offering them money, drugs, whatever they want. But mostly, they‚Äôre offering them a way to stop the nightmares. One girl was propositioned at a gas station in Nashville, another at a bus stop in Bend, Oregon. A few of the boys confirmed that they‚Äôve been confronted at arcades, shopping malls, skate parks.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a recruitment drive,‚Äù said Bridger.

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what it looks like,‚Äù said Nash.

‚ÄúAnd Francis, does he even understand what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna say he knows in an intuitive way. Also, he was raised by White Owl, the woman with feathers in her hair. He‚Äôs had her indoctrination for most of his life. For better or worse, she‚Äôs a player in this game. She has an agenda, and she‚Äôs making sure he plays his part.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis White Owl. Who the hell is she?‚Äù asked Bridger.

‚ÄúThat is another mystery I ain‚Äôt been able to unravel,‚Äù said Nash. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinkin that maybe she‚Äôs going to reveal herself at one of these concerts. She‚Äôs got to be keepin a close eye on the talent.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, I don‚Äôt really care,‚Äù Bridger said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to Ty, so it‚Äôs important to me. I‚Äôm here for Francis all the way, cause I know Ty is devoted with all his heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw you kneel at the Jiffy Stop, Bridger Washington. You tell me what that was.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd come too far through too many hellish nights. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he healed your son. And for that, you‚Äôre going to follow him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù

Nash reached out his hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here with you, brother,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm here for Ty.‚Äù

Your roommates in Makkah / Medina will probably be the same people as your group. If they are not, create a second whatsapp group with them or just combine everyone into one group.

1 ‚Äì Get a pair of Ihram appropriate chappal / slippers and get them verified by your local Molvi / Masjid Imam to make sure they are appropriate for Ihram.

2 ‚Äì Start walking. You can easily walk wearing joggers / sneakers but doing Tawaf / Hajj in slippers will become difficult and there is A LOT of walking. Umrah / Hajj has a lot of walking and foot-pain was the common complaint amongst people. 

3 ‚Äì Buy a pair of slippers, get them verified and then wear them and start walking. Go for 3 ‚Äì 5 km walk every day until you‚Äôre completely comfortable with the slippers. If you are satisfied with the slippers, buy another pair for hajj days. 

4 ‚Äì Tawaf / Umrah is done barefoot so if you can start walking bare foot within your house or treadmill to get comfortable with it. 
Foot pain / muscle cramps from walking is the number one reason people get sick at Hajj. The Pakistani Hajj clinic is stuffed wall to wall with Panadol because people hurt their feet so much because they are not used to walking.

Do not pack your luggage like you‚Äôre going to hajj in 1825, this is 2025, Saudi Arab is an advanced country and you‚Äôll find everything you need. Some things are more expansive than Pakistan like footwear/ umbrellas / electronics etc, but you‚Äôll find all sort of food / drinks there. And the best part is everything is 100% halal everywhere.

#WHERE DO I BUY HAJJ THINGS IN KARACHI?

* Alamgir Shop

* Madni Masjid shops

* Saddar Market

#SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS

[What to pack for UMRAH? | in under 2 minutes / Most of it applies for Hajj as well. 
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQYVB0k5SLA)


**TRAVELERS SIM**

* Hajis get free sims at airport but need to load a package. In case you don‚Äôt get a sim, there are numerous sim operators all around Makkah / Medina. 
STC had the best service. I got 500 Mbps ‚Äì 900Mbps constantly everywhere in KSA. 

**METAL HOOKS:**

* The door metal hooks were a lifesaver and were probably the most used item and everyone liked them. Highly recommend getting the big ones for the hotel / Maktab and the small ones to carry with you. They are very useful when you‚Äôre in Ihram and need to hang the upper part or your bag when going to washroom. They were very useful in Minah to hang bags / glasses / food in shoppers. 

* [Big metal hooks for hotel / maktab](https://i.imgur.com/IOayTA0.png)

* [Small metal hooks for washroom / portable](https://i.imgur.com/314notj.png)

* [You can find these metal hooks on daraz easily](https://i.imgur.com/u54o0ZD.png)



**WATER BOTTLE WITH SPRAY**

* Water bottle with a spray. [You will be using that spray a lot during hajj and during Tawaf.](https://i.imgur.com/YTYIjUK.png) 
* [Also get a small separate spray bottle if you can.](https://i.imgur.com/lpPAYEL.png) 

**NAYAPAY / SADAPAY**

* I used Nayapay everywhere in KSA and it worked like a charm.
* PLEASE CALL YOUR BANK to make sure your debit / credit card works properly when you‚Äôre in KSA. Some banks still require manual activation. 

**PRESCRIPTION SUN GLASSES**

* If you wear glasses, get prescription sunglasses made and wear them to get used to them. 


**PORTABLE PRAYER MAT**

* Makkah / Medina has two modes. Inside everything / floor is freezing cold and outside everything / floor is scorching hot.[ ALWAYS keep a portable prayer mat with you.](https://i.imgur.com/Ut7IgiM.jpeg) 

**TRAVELERS / UNIVERSAL ADAPTER**

* [Highly recommend you get one,](https://i.imgur.com/2TaLcRj.png) try it with your electronics phone / power bank / kettle etc to check if works properly. KSA has multiple types of outlets everywhere you go, so it will come handy.

**ELECTRIC KETTLE**

* Hotel / Maktab in Makkah / Medina usually provide Electric Kettle but its better to have one of your own. Not everyone needs to carry one, just one per-group / per-room is good enough. Communicate with your group to make sure there is at least one electric kettle. We made tea / coffee / all day every day. 

**UN-SCENTED / FRAGRANCE FREE SOAP / TISSUES** 

* All shops mentioned above will have un-scented soaps, shampoo and tissues. 
* You can get them at Alamgir, Naheed, Carrefour, Daraz and also from here

https://easypapersoap.com.pk/product/fragrance-free-paper-soap/

**EXTENSION / LEAD**

One per room is good. Just make sure it has a heavy wire and ceramic plug so it can handle load of heavy stuff like electric kettle / clothing iron / high powered mobile chargers.

#HAJJ AND YOUR SMART PHONE

Your smartphone will be your best friend to go around and talk to people in KSA. Google translate is God-sent and it helped with communication issues with shop keepers / hotels everywhere. 

**DOWNLOAD GOOGLE OFFLINE MAPS**

* Download offline map for Makkah City

* Download offline map for Medina City

* As soon as you get to your maktab/ hotel ADD it to your google maps and share it with everyone on whatsapp.

* As soon as you get to your Miah Camp, add it to your google maps and share it with everyone on whatsapp.

* As soon as you get to your Arafat Camp, add it to your google maps and share it with everyone on whatsapp.

* It‚Äôs very easy to lose track and location of your tent in Minah and Arafat.


**DOWNLOAD GOOGLE TRANSLATE**

* Download Google translate app: Download English, Arabic, Urdu language packs.

#ONE MONTH BEFORE HAJJ

Highly recommend living an entire day or two in an Ihram to get used to wearing it going about your day.

1iroyaq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iroyaq,Diego Bermudez's Showroom - Native Coffee Co. (Dallas),"Had a great time during my second visit to Native Coffee Co. in Dallas! I'm not sure if this was always the case, but it's now co-owned by Diego Bermudez, a producer, and he does the roasting at origin in Colombia. They also say on their website that they often roast coffees within a week of harvest/processing. Apparently Bermudez has a new project called ""Hachi"" which I think focuses on higher-end cleaner and terroir focused coffees. I believe Manhattan and Prodigal have featured Hachi coffees in the past.

I found out about Diego Bermudez through Letty Bermudez and the thermal shock coffees, and I know his coffees are still having a moment right now with Milky Cake from Dak and Buttercream from September with their unique flavor profiles. I'm constantly shocked at how transparent and clean these thermal shock coffees can be despite having insane flavor profiles.

The pourover menu here is a bit pricey, which I understand because of workflow and stuff. I got a ""competition drip"" which was their ""spiced citrus"" thermal shock. I got clear lemongrass, ginger, and lime notes, with some funk in the finish. I left with bags of a thermal shock Castillo called ""golden hour"" and a washed pink bourbon. We also had a specialty matcha latte. Overall a good experience, and the baristas were really nice and informative.",34,1739812421.0,pourover,9,1.0,False

When it was time to head to the cashier I saw the same chick I went to last time and I remember that we had a cordial/friendly but very short back and forth last time when I saw her with coffee and she said she only drinks it occasionally. So today I walked up to her and was like ""hello my coffee friend"" and she immediately lit up and replied ""helloooooo nice to see you again"" or something similar like that. So I casually made a joke about ""I bet you have coffee again"" and she did this weird shy thing where she reached under the counter and showed me her cup of coffee pretending to be ashamed. So I just laughed and said ""I knew it"" and walked off to put back the basket and when I came back...she had this hesitant/shy yet inquisitive and interesting face and asked me if I use Facebook.

I don't use Facebook. So I was like nahhh I'm not really into the social media thing and she said ""aww...so no Instagram/Snapchat/TikTok nothing at all?"" I said nahhh not at all I just have WhatsApp for communication but I'm not big into the social media stuff. She had a kinda disappointed look on her face but she was still smiling. The plumber joined in and said he doesn't have social media either and it hit me....YOU IDIOT. She was clearly asking for your number (or the modern day equivalent - social media). Anyways...I just gave her trouble about the coffee again and she said ""I don't like how you're giving me trouble about my coffee"" in a playful manner and I said ""well next time we'll see if you'll have coffee again"". She replied ""yes hopefully, we'll see next time"" and gave me my bill and with the nicest smile said have an amazing day, to which I replied you have a better one. 

As a man who is pretty introverted and serious and don't really go out of my way to be flirtatious or anything that made my day so much better. It's 2 hours later and it's still on my mind. I'm not in the best shape (overweight but working on that), was wearing working clothes (so not very presentable) and she still for some reason showed me genuine interest. She also looks like she's 10 years younger than I am (34) so that was also really unusual. I've never really had a hard time per SE with ladies but it's been a while since I've been engaged like that so obviously. Just thought I'd share because I'm a pretty lone wolf kinda guy with a very small circle and I don't share much with people. I just wanted to let these thoughts out because she must be tired running through my head these past few hours. Thanks for reading if you got this far.

So what do you do if you run into some lighter roast beans that are tricker to dial-in?  **Recently I figured out a neat trick: you can just pour some hot water water on top of the puck screen to ""pre-infuse"" the puck before loading the portafilter onto the machine.**    
  
I recently ran into dial-in problems with a bag of single origin beans.  Tried grinding finer until the puck started channeling and still could not tame the tartness.  This trick helped tame the channeling, let me grind a little bit finer, and resulted in a some balanced and tasty cups.

**Procedure is pretty simple:**

1. Puck prep as usual then place the puck screen.
2. Using a pitcher, gently pour hot water (200F for me) on the puck screen util portafilter basket is filled to the rim.
3. Wait a few seconds for the water to soak in (only a little water will go in the top, the water level will not drop noticeably).
4. Carefully load the portafilter onto the machine, keeping the water from spilling if possible (most of the water will spill out as you screw in the portafilter, this is ok).
5. Run your shot as usual.

Overall this was pretty easy and I really enjoyed the results.  My setup is 20g coffee in 22g 58mm portafilter basket, 1.7mm thick mesh puck screen.",1,1739812319.0,espresso,1,0.6,False

He‚Äôs met this director a couple of times during coffee hours, and the guy seemed friendly enough. But now, things have taken a really bad turn.

Here‚Äôs what happened: My friend took a course outside the CS department‚Äîone that‚Äôs actually pretty popular among CS students. They didn‚Äôt know they needed permission to enroll in it, especially since the enrollment system didn‚Äôt ask for any permission number like other courses. Even if my friend had asked for permission, the director just sends a casual ""okay"" without much follow-up.

Now, the director has sent an email saying that either my friend‚Äôs scholarship will be canceled or they won‚Äôt be allowed to do a co-op (which, as we all know, RIT is known for). Instead of fixing the SIS system that caused this confusion, it feels like the director is just targeting students.

My friend is super upset, and I don‚Äôt blame them. This could easily be resolved, but instead, it‚Äôs threatening their future. What‚Äôs the best way for my friend to formally raise a complaint about this situation?

I handed out water at an aid station during last year's marathon and felt very inspired by the runners to give it a go this year - and I'm so glad I did! I had such a fun time out yesterday and I absolutely love the community spirit of these types of events. 

### Training
I (27f) am a relatively new runner, with a background in swimming. I'd never done an official race longer than the 5mi turkey trot last November - so this was uncharted territory. I'd never run regularly before, but these past ~3months have really made me fall in love with it.
I followed the Nike Run Club marathon training plan, starting at 12 weeks out. I followed it pretty closely until about 4 weeks ago when I took 12 days off running with a very sore IT band. My biggest weekly volume was about 33 miles, with my longest run at 18.5mi. I had to miss my longest 'long run' with the IT band injury, and was pretty worried about taking time off - but it turns out that was a good move and I healed up pretty well with some rest. 

### Pre-race
I am an Austin-local so luckily didn't have to travel for this race. I did a 15min run on Friday as a shakeout and rested Saturday with plenty of carbs (rice, potatoes). 

Morning of the run I woke up at 5am and had a blueberry bagel, a banana and 2 black coffees. I took a couple Imodium and prayed I wouldn't have to use the toilet on the course (by some miracle I didn't). I left home around 6:00am on my ebike, and rode the ~10 minutes to the course start. I was able to park my bike very close to the course which was awesome. I had a hoodie and some sweatpants to stay warm before the race that I left with my bike. I settled on gloves, a long sleeve and shorts for the run, along with my Hoka Rocket X shoes. Starting temps were around 40 with lots of wind - and I think I was well dressed for it. 

My nutrition plan for the run was to have a pack of jelly belly sport beans every 6 miles or so, and have some water at most aid stations. I had a packet at the start, and then 4 packets of sport beans through the run (100 cals and 50mg caffeine in each). I had a couple sips of water at each station except for the first and last couple. This ended up working really well and I didn't feel that I had too much or too little water/nutrition.

### Race
I started in the middle of corral B - about 8:00 back from the gun. First couple of miles were definitely congested, but I typically start pretty slow so I was fine with a couple of 9:10 miles to get started. My goal was to stick to 8:45 mile pace to allow some cushion for the 4:00 attempt, but when I found myself even with the 4:20 pace group after a mile I started to think I was going too slow. I picked up the pace a bit and parted ways with my friends that I had been running with. 

I was in such a great mood running through the streets of Austin, feeling good, loving the bands, signs, fans, and clear morning sky. I didn't have any earphones in at all yesterday - the sights and sounds were more than enough. I glanced down at my watch every now and then and started to see I was steadily gaining time on my goal pace (shoutout apple watch pace features - this was awesome). Around the 10 mile mark I was feeling good, and started to target 3:40 as my goal time. It was all feeling pretty effortless, a lot easier than all the training runs and my heart-rate was comfortable below 150bpm. Ticked through the halfway point feeling good, and was slowly catching up and passing each pace group - which was a great little confidence boost. At about mile 18-19 I thought about how awesome it would be to get near the 3:30 mark - but I didn't let myself get too carried away with that idea because I didn't want to get disappointed if I hit a wall and started to struggle. By some miracle it just all really came together yesterday - I felt strong, happy, comfortable. In my long runs I typically get out of breath and my heartrate always creeps up into the high 160s. Yesterday my heart-rate was hovering around 150bpm and I wasn't feeling puffed at all. I expected cardio to be the limiter yesterday but surprisingly that was not the case.

At around mile 23 I got a cramp in my left hip flexor - and started worrying that I would have to really struggle through the last 5k (maybe even walk). I had just passed the 3:40 pace group so I knew if I stayed ahead of them I would be at least 3:32. That became the goal! I tucked in behind another runner and just stared at his feet mindlessly trying to ignore the pain. Fortunately the pain subsided after about 5mins and I was able to pick it back up. I felt I had plenty in the tank so I was able to keep dropping time and ran up the final hill feeling stoked. The energy from the crowd was amazing and the whole event just felt like a great celebration of life. 

### Post-race
Met up with some amazing friends and headed to a beer garden for some celebratory food, drinks, and music. I was so pumped up on adrenaline, and probably had a bit too much fun - but that's showbiz. Still riding the endorphins.

Legs are feeling very dusty today of course, but I think I might be hooked on marathons. I feel like I probably could have gone a bit harder earlier - but I was worried about crashing out in my first marathon. With some experience now under my belt I'm looking forward to the next one.

1)Hiatus Hernia-¬†Change in the structure of the lower esophageal sphincter which can be due to¬†hiatal hernia¬†which is a condition in which there is herniation of the visceral organ like the stomach into the mediastinum through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm to change in the anatomical shape of the esophagus and it can lead to GERD.

2)¬†Pregnancy- It can increase intraabdominal pressure, especially in twins, triplets, or more can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease.

3)¬†Obesity¬†- Especially central obesity in which the abdominal size of the person increases is more prone to develop GERD.

4)¬†Alcoholics - They are at increased risk of developing abdomen-related disease which includes gastroesophageal reflux disease.

5)¬†Fried Food- People who are more inclined towards a fatty food diet have increased chances of suffering from this disease as fatty food takes time to get digested and this increases the risk of returning back of the food from the stomach to the mouth.

6)¬†Smoking¬†- It is also a risk factor for developing GERD.

7)¬†Spicy food

8)¬†Pain medication like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can cause gastroesophageal reflux disease if taken for a long time.

9)¬†People who are prone to¬†heavy meals.

10)¬†Those people who are in the habit of going to bed after food¬†have more chances of developing reflux disease.

I used to be an avid coffee drinker. I wouldn‚Äôt over do it, but I always looked forward to my cup of coffee in the morning. It would make me feel clear headed and kind of pick me up, but no negative effects.

After I discovered my deficiency when taking blood tests after having onset symptoms, one thing that really stuck out to me was I could no longer drink coffee, or any form of caffeine. It would make me feel very panicky, like there was adrenaline going through my body, and I would get air hunger and just overall feel terrible. 

I‚Äôm asking if this is a common symptom because over the past year, I dealt with a lot of deficiencies after a summer of very intense cardio training, then being hit with covid and then going on a heavy course of antibiotics for Lyme (didn‚Äôt end up even having Lyme).

**Langley‚Äôs Silicon Valley Side Hustle Becomes the Forefront of Global Deception**

Picture a dimly-lit boardroom in Langley, the air thick with burnt coffee and the existential dread of bureaucrats who just realized the internet wasn‚Äôt a fad. It‚Äôs 1999. The CIA, fresh off missing every red flag before 9/11, decides Silicon Valley‚Äôs hoodie-clad code monkeys might save their bacon. Enter **In-Q-Tel (IQT)**, Langley‚Äôs answer to Fyre Festival‚Äîa nonprofit VC masquerading as innovation‚Äôs savior while weaponizing your tax dollars to turn TikTok filters into spy tools.

Two decades later, IQT isn‚Äôt a secret. It‚Äôs a *vibe*‚Äîa Kafkaesque blend of Cold War paranoia and venture capital grift. From **Google Earth** (n√©e Keyhole, RIP privacy) to **Palantir** (Peter Thiel‚Äôs Skynet starter kit), IQT‚Äôs portfolio reads like a dystopian Mad Libs. Their mission? To own the future before you even know it‚Äôs for sale.

---

**Birth of a Bureaucratic Frankenstein**

In 1999, the CIA‚Äîstill reeling from the shock that fax machines weren‚Äôt cutting it‚Äîoutsourced its midlife crisis to **Norman Augustine**, Lockheed Martin‚Äôs ex-CEO. His pitch: *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs let Silicon Valley build our spy toys so Congress can‚Äôt yell at us when they blow up.‚Äù* Thus, IQT was born, a ‚Äúnonprofit‚Äù with a taxpayer-funded allowance and a license to cosplay as a VC.

The **Q**, of course, is a nod to James Bond‚Äôs gadget guru‚Äîa fitting metaphor for an agency that once poisoned Castro‚Äôs cigars and now invests in AI that can poison democracy. **Jeffrey Smith**, the CIA‚Äôs former top lawyer and IQT architect, later admitted they needed a name with ‚Äúsex appeal.‚Äù Mission accomplished. Nothing says ‚Äúsexy‚Äù like a spy agency funding hologram startups and **mouth radios** (Sonitus Medical‚Äôs tooth-mounted comms device‚Äî*because earbuds are for peasants*).

Key to IQT‚Äôs grift: **dual-use tech**. Facial recognition for mall security? Perfect for tracking dissidents. Sentiment analysis for TikTok? Ideal for psyops. As Smith bragged, *‚ÄúWhat \[CIA analysts\] have today is breathtaking.‚Äù* Breathtaking, indeed. Like a sucker punch to the Fourth Amendment.

---

**The Cast of Characters‚ÄîSpooks, Suits, and Silicon Bros**

IQT‚Äôs boardroom is a revolving door of **spy-world rejects** and **tech bros** who‚Äôve never met a moral boundary they couldn‚Äôt monetize:

- **Steve Bowsher (CEO):** Harvard-Stanford‚Äôs finest, a human LinkedIn algorithm who turned IQT into a $1.2B slush fund. His superpower? Convincing startups that ‚Äúnational security‚Äù is code for ‚Äúget rich.‚Äù
- **Matt Strottman (COO):** The guy who stares at Bloomberg terminals and whispers, *‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt Skynet EBITDA-positive yet?‚Äù*
- **Morgan Mahlock (Investor):** In 2020, she teased IQT‚Äôs investment in a ‚Äútoxic content‚Äù detector‚Äîa company so classified even its name is redacted. *Nothing shady here, folks!*
- **Chris Darby (ex-CEO):** The man who once told Congress that DoD brass trailing ‚Äú50 people‚Äù in Silicon Valley was *‚Äúnot the way the Valley operates.‚Äù* Translation: Spooks in suits scare off unicorns.

Then there‚Äôs **George Hoyem**, IQT‚Äôs investment guru, who casually drops that 70% of their tech makes it to pilot stages‚Äîmeaning half get shoved into Langley‚Äôs arsenal. *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking commercial startups and showing them a dual use into the government,‚Äù* he smirked in 2020. Dual use. Like turning Blackshark.AI‚Äôs Microsoft Flight Simulator tech into **ORCA HUNTR**, a tool to ‚Äúdetect any object on Earth.‚Äù *What could go wrong?*

---

**Follow the Money (If You Can)**

IQT‚Äôs finances are a masterclass in creative accounting:

- **$1.2 billion** in taxpayer cash since 2011.
- **$526 million** from Uncle Sam between 2015‚Äì2020 alone.
- CEO salaries hitting **$1M/year**‚Äîbecause why should Silicon Valley have all the fun?

But here‚Äôs the kicker: IQT‚Äôs a nonprofit. *Allegedly*. Profits get funneled into ‚Äúoperations‚Äù (read: Aspen retreats and artisanal scotch). Their investments? A dystopian bingo card:

- **Palantir:** Because democratizing mass surveillance is *so* 2020.
- **Databricks:** A $43B data-crunching beast that‚Äôs probably reading your emails.
- **Behavioral Signals:** Peddling ‚ÄúPolygraph Plus,‚Äù an AI that judges your ‚Äútrustworthiness‚Äù by voice stress. *Move over, Freud.*

And let‚Äôs not forget the **2016 Wall Street Journal expos√©** revealing IQT‚Äôs trustees held board seats at companies they funded. Conflicts of interest? *Nah‚Äîjust capitalism with a side of espionage.*

---

**AI, Misinformation, and the Art of Gaslighting Nations**

IQT‚Äôs latest pet project? **Trust Lab**, a ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù watchdog with CIA cash and a God complex. Their AI scours the internet for ‚Äútoxic content,‚Äù which, in Langley-speak, means *whatever we say it means*. CEO Tom Siegel claims it‚Äôs about ‚Äúsafeguarding the internet,‚Äù but let‚Äôs translate:

- **‚ÄúForeign-focused‚Äù:** Sure, until it‚Äôs *domestic-focused*. Remember the Postal Service‚Äôs **iCOP program** monitoring BLM protests?
- **‚ÄúHigh-risk content‚Äù:** Code for ‚Äúspeech that embarrasses the State Department.‚Äù

Meanwhile, IQT‚Äôs AI portfolio is a parade of dual-use horrors:

- **Fiddler.AI:** Markets ‚Äúresponsible AI‚Äù while helping drones ‚Äúanticipate threats‚Äù in warzones.
- **Blackshark.AI:** Turns satellite imagery into a *Where‚Äôs Waldo?* for drone strikes.

And who defines ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù? The same folks who brought you **MKUltra** and **Iran-Contra**. *Trust us!*

---

**The Future‚ÄîSame Spooks, New Toys**

IQT‚Äôs 2025 roadmap is a fever dream of techno-dystopia:

- **Quantum Computing:** To crack encryption before you finish your latte.
- **Neurotech:** Because why stop at tracking your location when we can map your dopamine?
- **Autonomous Drones:** For when human pilots get queasy about civilian casualties.

As ex-CEO Darby quipped, *‚ÄúStartups don‚Äôt speak government, and government doesn‚Äôt speak startup.‚Äù* But they both speak money‚Äîand IQT‚Äôs got plenty.

---

**The Banality of Techno-Tyranny**

IQT isn‚Äôt just a VC firm. It‚Äôs a **warning**‚Äîa blueprint for how democracies dissolve into surveillance states with a smiley-face logo. The CIA doesn‚Äôt need to hack your devices anymore. They‚Äôll just invest in the companies building them.

So next time you zoom in on Google Earth or rant on Twitter, remember: The same tech that entertains you could be training an algorithm to silence you. *Stay vigilant. Stay paranoid. And maybe check your fillings for trackers.*

I wanted to work closely with experienced owners and really understand what it takes to operate a successful shop.

But I hate it.

Not because working in coffee is tough or because customers can be difficult‚Äîthat‚Äôs just part of the job‚Äîbut because I feel like I was misled about my role. When I first spoke with the owner, they seemed genuine. We discussed my responsibilities: training staff, ordering supplies, developing drinks, and curating the coffee program.

I‚Äôm doing none of that.

I don‚Äôt even make my own schedule. And to make things worse, the owner has a short temper. They‚Äôre not impossible to talk to, but they‚Äôre constantly miserable, making passive-aggressive comments I don‚Äôt even know how to respond to. Lately, I barely see them at all.

I took this job because it paid more than my last assistant manager role, but now I‚Äôm wondering if I should just go back. I was making only $400‚Äì$500 less, and even though it wasn‚Äôt exactly what I wanted, I actually enjoyed working with those people.

I‚Äôm leaving out a lot of details because just thinking about this place makes me miserable. But I feel stuck‚Äîleaving too soon might look bad on my resume, but staying means wasting 8‚Äì9 hours a day doing nothing.

I know I should be grateful for the higher pay and stability, but at what cost?

Not looking to rehash if I've made the right purchase or anything, as I know I could have gone different directions for any number of reasons, this is the one I chose.   I was looking at the Breville Impress but decided to go with an automatic as we're a few weeks from baby #2 and I didn't think it would be a great time for my wife and I to explore being amateur baristas.  We both enjoy a good cup of coffee, mainly just drink black drip coffee at this point, but were given a Nespresso a while back and have both realized we enjoy better drinks, but want to avoid the waste and expense of those silly pods. 

Some questions - and if there's a resource I missed, feel free to ignore the rest and just point me in that direction. 

We have decently hard water, so I've already purchased a Clearyl Smart+ filter and cleaning tablets.  Is there anything additional I should be on the lookout for?

Accessories? Neither of us drink much milk, so I'll be skipping that line of add-ons for now.  That may change in the future.

**Query:**

Dear \[Agent\],¬†

CITY OF DREAMS is a standalone YA fantasy novel with series potential, complete at 97,000 words. Perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo‚Äôs *Six of Crows,* it blends the delectable underworld and heist from Hafsah Faizal‚Äôs *A Tempest of Tea* with the masterful deception and infiltration in J. Elle‚Äôs *House of Marionne.*¬†

In everchanging Salkesh, not only dreams but nightmares weave the world‚Äîand, with public safety to consider, nightmares are a felony, even if sparked by someone else‚Äôs mistakes.¬†

18-year-old Kali Lozano has weathered six long years on Salkesh's volatile streets, cycling through fake identities with only her best friend as refuge. Tired of gigs gone wrong, she accepts her friend‚Äôs teary-eyed ultimatum: she‚Äôll leave her underground life behind. Before she can, her best friend‚Äôs fear for Kali‚Äôs safety blossoms into a nightmare, and both of them are caught in the fallout.¬†

Facing the consequences of her schemes as the authorities drag her best friend away, Kali hungers for the one object that might get her out of this mess: the public ledger. The ledger is a living record of each of Salkesh‚Äôs secrets and sins. With it, she‚Äôd learn exactly where to find her apprehended best friend‚Äîand how to finally bury her lies for good.

Kali sheds her skin once more and infiltrates a secret society of dreamwalking mages. Though they have a plan to heist the public ledger, it hinges entirely on Kali‚Äôs nonexistent magic. She‚Äôs soon ensnared by the secrets that linger in the society‚Äôs halls and a growing love for her newfound home and intoxicating mentor. If she can‚Äôt keep her true identity contained, she‚Äôll not only lose the family she never thought she‚Äôd have, but watch any chance of finding her best friend slip right through her deft hands.

By day, I am a psychology student at \[Mexican University\] and a \[REDACTED\], where my time involves medical writing and editing articles. Nestled in the mountains in \[REDACTED\], I can be found with a cat on my lap and coffee in hand. Like Kali, I am both autistic and Latina (Salvadoran-Canadian), and I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

**First 300:**

Tonight, under the glowing moon stretching for the crest of Salkesh‚Äôs sky, the edge of the world hung, warped and ripped and jagged, precisely three steps past where Kali‚Äôs feet came to a skittering halt.

She exhaled, the hollow tang of her hand slapping against the cold lamppost still reverberating into the night. Dark hair plastered to her forehead in sticky chunks and she adjusted the backpack straps that bit into where her shoulders met her body. Her timing was off, and now there was no way to reach the other side of the city.¬†

‚ÄúBy the Law! Are you insane? *Running?* In *Salkesh?*‚Äù A portly passerby edged closer. The woman walked with the poise carried only by a local, each step calculated.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm new to town,‚Äù Kali lied, hazarding a glance at the abyss. Ink as bleak as night pressed taut against the earth‚Äôs border. In the depths, stars had the audacity to twinkle.¬†

‚ÄúVolatility level *eight.*‚Äù The woman reached Kali‚Äôs side, her mouth curved in a grotesque grimace as her hand tightened around her oversized purse. Tufts of excessive perfume struck, too sharp, too much. ‚ÄúThat means no running.‚Äù¬†

Releasing the post that‚Äôd stopped her momentum, Kali straightened. She had, of course, known better than to run, but her legs had propelled her with a greater terror for the vials she carried on her back than for what tonight‚Äôs dreamers left before her. Or rather, *not* before her.

She eyed the woman and tapped her forefinger against her thumb in quick succession. Her short blonde hair reached desperately for shoulders in scraggy wisps. The woman was well-dressed and middle-aged, an expensive brooch capturing the real estate on her navy blazer.¬†

I know I watched him die before they even showed up.  

I'm lost and hurt and dead inside.  I knew him for about 5 years.  We hadn't even been married two years.  We had so many plans... now I'm a widow in my early 30s and missing my soul mate.

1irof1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1irof1r/why_your_business_needs_a_vpn_for_secure_remote/,Why Your Business Needs a VPN for Secure Remote Work,"In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, remote work has become the new normal. While this shift offers flexibility and productivity benefits, it also comes with security risks. Cyber threats, data breaches, and unauthorized access have become significant concerns for businesses. This is where a Virtual Private Network (VPN) plays a crucial role. A VPN ensures a secure and encrypted connection, protecting sensitive business data and enabling employees to work safely from anywhere.

# The Growing Need for Secure Remote Work

With employees accessing company networks from various locations, businesses must prioritize security. Public Wi-Fi networks, unsecured connections, and cyber threats can put confidential data at risk. A VPN acts as a shield, creating a secure tunnel between the user and the company‚Äôs internal network.

# Key Benefits of Using a VPN for Remote Work

# 1. Enhanced Data Security

A VPN encrypts all data transmitted between employees and the company‚Äôs servers. This prevents hackers from intercepting sensitive information such as passwords, financial records, and client data. Even if an attacker tries to access the network, the encrypted data remains unreadable.

# 2. Secure Access to Company Resources

A VPN allows remote employees to securely connect to internal systems, cloud storage, and business applications without exposing them to potential threats. It ensures that only authorized personnel can access critical data, reducing the risk of security breaches.

# 3. Protection from Cyber Threats

Cybercriminals often target remote workers using phishing attacks, malware, and ransomware. A VPN adds an extra layer of security by masking the user‚Äôs IP address and making it difficult for hackers to track or attack business devices.

# 4. Safe Use of Public Wi-Fi

Employees working remotely often connect to public Wi-Fi in coffee shops, airports, or hotels. These networks are notorious for security vulnerabilities. A VPN protects against data theft by encrypting connections, ensuring that cybercriminals cannot intercept confidential information.

# 5. Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations

Businesses must adhere to strict data protection laws. A VPN helps meet compliance requirements by securing communication channels and ensuring sensitive data remains private. This is especially crucial for industries handling financial, healthcare, or legal information.

# 6. Increased Productivity and Flexibility

With a VPN, employees can securely access work files and communication tools without being restricted by geographical barriers. This enhances productivity and allows businesses to expand their remote workforce without compromising security.

# 7. Cost-Effective Security Solution

Implementing a VPN is a cost-effective way to secure remote work operations. It eliminates the need for expensive security infrastructure while providing robust protection against cyber threats. Businesses can focus on growth without worrying about security vulnerabilities.

# Future-Proofing Remote Work Security

As remote work continues to grow, businesses must invest in reliable security solutions. A VPN not only safeguards company data but also builds trust among employees and clients. For even greater security and flexibility, integrating a **vless/vmess proxy service** alongside a VPN can enhance network performance while maintaining high levels of encryption and privacy.

By prioritizing cybersecurity, businesses can create a safe and efficient remote work environment, ensuring long-term success in the digital era.",1,1739811153.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

I have been laid up sick so I have basically been doom scrolling through Facebook and lately a lot of our Potato Queen‚Äôs older videos have been coming through my reels as I‚Äôm scrolling and it‚Äôs bringing out a lot of crazy memories and I just have the urge to post them to make other people‚Äôs days like theirs do mine. (or at least stave off the boredom lol)

Just before COVID, I worked at Tim Horton‚Äôs. I absolutely loved it, loved most my co workers, and-as usual with retail or fast food-had a hit or miss with my customers.  

I should mention that I live in New York which means that I worked in an American Tim Horton‚Äôs not a Canadian one. I live close enough to the Canadian Border that we have A LOT of Canadians come down, especially when we have major sales (think Black Friday sales, Memorial Day sales, stuff like that) so around those times we always had a pretty good uptick in Canadian Customers. This is an important detail because this is when I found out that Canadian Tim‚Äôs and American Tim‚Äôs *do not serve the same things*.

One afternoon, a Canadian couple came into the store. The wife wanted to order a tea, so I asked her which one so that I could prepare the correct one. She ordered a London Fog. Cue my own brain fog, as I had been working there for over six months and had never prepared let alone heard of a London Fog. I asked her to repeat what type of tea she wanted, and she said it again: a London Fog. I definitely sounded a bit confused as I asked her what that was. 

She got a bit huffy and asked me how I could work at Tim‚Äôs and NOT know what a London Fog was. I think it was about this time her husband had looked at our menu hanging above me and realized that we didn‚Äôt have it because I saw some form of realization come over his face. This was when he said to me that they were from Canada and had come down for a weekend trip. That‚Äôs when it clicked with *me* which I could tell that he saw it cross my face. I turned to his wife said that I apologize but we are an American Tim‚Äôs and I hadn‚Äôt heard of a London Fog before as we don‚Äôt serve it. 

She looked flabbergasted and yelled ‚Äúhow do you NOT serve a London Fog? Tim Horton‚Äôs is a Canadian Company! You HAVE to have it!‚Äù I again tried to gently explain that while the company IS from Canada, she was currently in a New York location in America and it was something that we didn‚Äôt have on our menu. That while I couldn‚Äôt speak for the other two locations that were nearby as well, I don‚Äôt believe that they had it either. She is now throwing a huge fit, her husband is trying to calm her down and said something about ‚Äúit‚Äôs just like regional differences at home‚Äù which caused an even bigger scene. Suddenly she demands to speak to my manager. My manager, who is not there. 

We were the smallest store in the area so around four o‚Äôclock every day the closer is left to close alone from four to ten; we were attached to a gas station and knew the workers on the other side pretty well so we all kept eyes on each other. Right now it‚Äôs almost five, so I now have to explain to her that I am the only one in the store.

This man is trying to calm her down, I am completely flabbergasted (and mind you I had worked in the local movie theatre not too long before where we had six different Karens that were regulars so I‚Äôm use to calming someone down but she just *would not* relax) and speechless. I heard a ding in my ear, and turned to look at my screen because I had a car come pull up in my drive through. I turned back to the woman and her husband completely confused on what to do. He saw my look and told me to take care of drive real quick. (It was my five thirty usual so they were taken care of pretty fast.) I come back and this woman is screaming at me to call my manager, something I really couldn‚Äôt do because they were in the store and I couldn‚Äôt leave them alone in the lobby but I also couldn‚Äôt have my phone on the floor.  

About this time, the door behind her opened and I tried not to let a look of relief cross my face. It as my Assistant Manager who lived down the street. Calmly she walked up and asked if everything was okay. This woman turned her ire on my manager and told her to mind her business which seemed to shock her husband as well as myself and my manager. (I should mention part of the reason I was so shocked is because this was the first Canadian that had come through that hadn‚Äôt been super sweet towards me, our Canadian customers were always so nice!) 

After she screamed at my manager, I turned to her and said ‚ÄúMary (fake name) have you ever heard of a London Fog?‚Äù She looked at me and said, ‚Äúoh yeah. It‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt serve because either one of the ingredients is one that the American locations can‚Äôt get for some reason, or we don‚Äôt have the right equipment but I‚Äôm not sure which one.‚Äù Suddenly this woman stops screaming and turns to Mary with this dumbfounded look. Mary looked at her and said ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm one of the Managers. The gas station attendant called me saying you were screaming at my employee and asking for me.‚Äù 

This woman was so shocked that she just turned to me and ordered on of our normal bagged teas before telling her husband that she would meet him in the car. Husband orders his coffee and is apologizing profusely, which I waved off saying he had no reason to apologize, it comes with the territory of working in Customer Service and I had been working in it for over a decade. He thanked me for the coffee, left a ten dollar bill in the tip cup before nodding to my manager and leaving. We exchanged looks and I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to cry in relief at seeing her or cry in frustration that that just happened. Mary went back and had watched the security footage as well as talked to the gas attendants so she knew it wasn‚Äôt on me. She decided to stay with me through close which was a HUGE relief because I had two tour buses come into the parking lot an hour later and got slammed.

Due to my line of work, I tend to have a lot of female co-workers for both jobs, whether it‚Äôs other teachers or section leaders for the church choir. 

Every now and then, my co-workers and I go out after professional developments for lunch/dinner . For the church job, me and the alto section leader carpool to save on gas and sometimes we end up stopping on the way back home to get something to eat/chat a bit. 

My girlfriend and soon to be fianc√© (25F) has a problem with me hanging out with any of these co-workers outside of work especially if they‚Äôre female. 

For instance, one time a music teacher from my zone asked if I wanted to go a nearby restaurant and I agreed. When we got there we talked about our SO‚Äôs, the crazy things that happen in our classrooms, etc etc‚Ä¶ Then when I got home and started telling my girlfriend about the conversation, my girlfriend started getting upset with me because she didn‚Äôt like the fact that I was hanging out with a girl one on one.

Recently, I went and got lunch with the alto section leader (28F) after mass, and we sat in a car while eating and talked about her boyfriend and my girlfriend. I came home, and once again she was upset because she didn‚Äôt like the fact that I was hanging out with a girl for an extended period of time. 

I‚Äôve been open and honest to my girlfriend about all of my interactions with all of my co-workers, and I often tell her about some of the crazy stuff they tell me. But she‚Äôs more worried about the fact that I‚Äôm a boy, and they‚Äôre a girl, and that ‚Äúno boy and girl can hang out without there being some sort of sexual attraction‚Äù (her words not mine) this is probably because of how boys treated her growing up as well as because cheating was the cause for her parents divorce. 

Last night we got into an argument because I hung out with the alto section leader between services at a coffee shop where I spent the majority of the time working on my lesson plans. Where her boyfriend stopped by and we talked about computers and video games n‚Äô stuff.

I honest to god only see my co-workers as friends. And while I would like to continue hanging out with them because I rarely make friends, I don‚Äôt want to jeopardize my relationship with my girlfriend because of them. 

AITAH?

1irnxrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1irnxrg/how_to_win_in_trading_keep_going_after_everyone/,How to win in trading: keep going after everyone else stops,"Hi everyone,

I'm a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader.

Making the leap to full-time trading has quite a journey, and along the way, I‚Äôve picked up some key concepts that have helped me navigate the ups and downs.

As I‚Äôve been writing out these ideas for myself, I thought they might be useful to others‚Äîwhether you're considering the transition to full-time trading or just looking to refine your approach. So, I figured I'd share them here.

**Here's my post:**

Last week, I had coffee with an aspiring trader. The last time we talked, he was bursting with fresh ideas and eager to make his mark in the trading world.

But when I asked how things were going, and if he was still working toward making trading his full-time career, he hesitated.

""Trading was way harder than I expected,"" he said. ""I lost money and decided to stop. I tried stocks and options‚Äîoptions were cool, but I just couldn‚Äôt grasp it.

I realized it would take years to get good at this and I‚Äôm not ready to invest that kind of time right now. Maybe I‚Äôll try again someday.""

Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common. But why is it the norm for so many?

Yes, the barrier to entry in trading is high‚Äîbut here‚Äôs the thing: so is everything else.

For example: the average acceptance rate for Ivy League schools is under 4%. Only the top 8-10% of realtors make six figures. Just 5% of all Amazon sellers generate over $1 million in revenue. The reality is that the barrier to success in¬†*any*¬†field is high.

I don‚Äôt think trading is anything extraordinary. It‚Äôs not some mysterious ""boogeyman"" of business that's harder than other career paths. I believe it‚Äôs totally achievable for the person who truly wants it and is willing to put in the work‚Äîjust like earning an Ivy League education, excelling in real estate, or hitting $1 million in Amazon sales. It all comes down to the individual and their commitment.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs frustrating to see new traders give in to self-doubt. So much potential gets derailed by short-term discouragement.

Today, I want to offer some encouragement. A career in trading isn‚Äôt just worth pursuing‚Äîit‚Äôs absolutely possible when built on the right foundation.

Let‚Äôs flip the script on this undeserved doubt and push your trading journey forward.

# The big problem with short term thinking

When I talk to struggling traders, or those hoping to transition to full-time, there‚Äôs a common theme: they view trading as a fast and easy path to riches. But in reality, it‚Äôs just like any other vocation or business.

Think about it‚Äîwhen else is taking the long road ever seen as a problem? Plumbers, dentists, real estate agents, and restaurant owners don‚Äôt have an issue with putting in the time and effort to get where they want to go.

What if we as traders adopted the same mindset?  
Trading is a business, after all.

What if, instead of thinking like most new traders who focus on days and weeks, we shifted to thinking in terms of months and years?

Whenever I face a decision, I like to ask myself: ""If I choose this path, what‚Äôs the alternative?"" In trading, the alternative to long-term thinking is, of course, short-term thinking‚Äîand that‚Äôs where the real problems start. This mindset can lead to things like:

* **Rushing to make a profit right away.**¬†What if a restaurant tried this? They might cut corners by using cheap ingredients, skimp on marketing, skip employee training, and ignore the fundamentals‚Äîleading to few, if any, return customers.
* **Making quick decisions with large amounts of money, without the experience to back it up.**¬†What if a new plumber took out a huge loan for tons of equipment and work trucks, without any real customers or business experience? Wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to use what he has, build a customer base, and then figure out what tools he actually needs?
* **Jumping from one strategy to the next, without giving them enough time.**¬†What if a real estate agent, looking for leads, tried knocking on doors in a local neighborhood for a few days, then gave up to focus on SEO for their website, just because they didn‚Äôt get immediate results? Had they stuck with the door-knocking strategy a little longer, they might have seen a lead come through and realized it was working.
* **Starting each business day without a clear process or routine.**¬†Imagine a local dentist who had no set schedule, no patient records, and no clear steps for addressing patient needs. It would be chaos.

Notice a theme yet?¬†*(Good things take time!)*  
Viewing trading as a long-term endeavor is what truly makes the difference.

# But what if you‚Äôre still stuck?

I know what you might be thinking: ""That sounds great, but I'm still scared. I‚Äôm afraid of starting and failing. I‚Äôm not in the right financial position to start a business, let alone trading.""

And that‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre not alone. Every single trader, no matter their experience, feels that type of fear. Every day.

My heart still skips a beat when I see the clock ticking down to the opening bell, even after years of trading. Millions of people‚Äîwannabe traders and elite fund managers alike‚Äîfeel the same way. That fear doesn‚Äôt disappear overnight. It may never go away completely, no matter what business you‚Äôre in.

But here‚Äôs my encouragement to you:

What you want is just on the other side of the unknown.

Every day you take a small step into the unknown, every time you take another trading rep, or make a small process improvement, they all add to your confidence to keep going. Because remember, you‚Äôre thinking long-term, just like a real business.

This is how you win.

# It's time to win

I know‚Äîwords are nice‚Äîbut how do you actually move forward? What are some practical steps you can use to move forward in your trading journey?

Let me put it this way: If you wanted to start a plumbing business, how would you ensure success, stay profitable, and keep going even when others have stopped?

1. **Start with the basics.**¬†Use new information to help lower fear of the unknown. First, you‚Äôd figure out exactly what you need to start‚Äîcertifications, tools, insurance, and so on. You‚Äôd probably watch a few YouTube videos from different people to get an overview of what it's like. (I really appreciate¬†SMB Capital‚Äôs free trading content¬†- no need to pay for anything, just learn all you can.)
2. **Get hands-on practice.**¬†Next, as an aspiring plumber, you‚Äôd start practicing with small jobs around the house or for close family, just to get those reps in and learn what it really takes. (This could look like taking small reps, I‚Äôm a big believer in one-share trades. Buy and sell one share only, until you have the data needed to show you where you‚Äôre profitable and you can start to scale.)
3. **Track everything.**¬†As you go, you might write everything down. Maybe film or take pictures of each plumbing job so you can study them later. You‚Äôd track what you enjoy, what areas are low-stress and easy for you, and what mistakes you make‚Äîalong with specific ways to fix them. (I like using¬†Notion¬†as a free way to start tracking things. Also¬†Edgewonk¬†is a great low-cost option.)
4. **Build a routine.**¬†You then start forming a daily routine. You‚Äôd maybe go to class to learn the trade in the morning, do homework in the afternoon, and then maybe work on a small jobs for practice at night or on weekends. You‚Äôd then make adjustments each day, noting things like:¬†*""I did poorly on my last exam because I stayed up too late. I‚Äôll go to bed at 9 pm to focus better in class, as well as have more energy for my plumbing jobs.""*(In trading, this is what‚Äôs known as your ‚Äúprocess‚Äù. Your routine that you follow, which you know gives you the best chance for success each day.)
5. **Repeat and improve.**¬†The key in any business is repetition. You‚Äôd keep following the same steps every day until you get so good that you either have the pick of which plumbing company to work for, or, start your own business. Then assume it would take one to three years to get there. (This is when you find your ‚Äúedge‚Äù ‚Äî¬†a repeatable trade setup¬†that you know gives you positive expected value over time.)
6. **Bonus.**¬†Along the way, you might only buy what you really need and try to practice frugality‚Äîno loans, using your own truck and tools, adding only as needed. This keeps the risk low while you learn and build your business. (This means keeping your costs and overhead low, in order to preserve and save up capital to trade with. And no need to overspend on fancy software or tools in the beginning‚Äî the focus should be on the fundamentals.)

# The bottom line

Let the aspiring trader at the beginning of this post serve as a reminder.

When it comes to building a trading career, you‚Äôre faced with two paths:

One path is focused on the short term, driven by immediate results and quick wins. This often leads to frustration and burnout, causing many to quit before they‚Äôve given themselves a real chance to succeed.

The other path‚Äîwhich offers a much higher probability of success‚Äîis grounded in long-term thinking. It‚Äôs about committing to continuous learning, persevering through challenges, and allowing time to develop your skills and strategy.

Success in trading‚Äîor in any field‚Äîisn‚Äôt owned by the smartest, the luckiest, or even the most naturally talented. It belongs to those who¬†*stay in the game*.

The truth is, every master trader, every successful entrepreneur, and every top performer started where you are: uncertain, inexperienced, and full of doubt. The only difference? They decided to push through and embrace the long game, and to build their foundation one step at a time.

So, what will you choose? Will you let short-term struggles define you? Or will you shift your mindset, commit to the process and lifestyle, and give yourself the time needed to truly succeed?

If you‚Äôve ever side-eyed those ‚Äú21-day transformations‚Äù but secretly wondered, ‚ÄúCould that be me?‚Äù‚Äîthis one‚Äôs for you.

**Backstory: The Ultimate Food Lover Meets a Health Crisis**

Aunt Linda (53, living in San Diego) is the kind of person who lives for good food. She‚Äôs that relative who makes sure no leftovers go to waste at family dinners. But after her annual checkup in June, her doctor gave her the talk‚Äîcholesterol up, blood sugar creeping higher, and, well‚Ä¶ the scale wasn‚Äôt being kind either.

**Her wake-up call? Struggling to zip up her favorite jeans.**

Instead of jumping into a hardcore gym routine (not her vibe at all), she went looking for something easy to start with. That‚Äôs when my cousin (her daughter) sent her a link to the 21-Day Smoothie Diet‚Äîa structured meal replacement plan where you swap two meals a day for nutrient-packed smoothies.

[21-Day Smoothie Diet](https://preview.redd.it/q3scij0p7qje1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=5df15fb7bb171d0cf813e9ec5056eb8d2fbfdc4e)

**The Setup: Skeptic Mode Activated**

Aunt Linda was not convinced. Her first reaction? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way drinking smoothies is going to do anything.‚Äù But the plan had a 3-day detox phase to start, and she figured, ‚ÄúOkay, I can handle three days.‚Äù

She got the full 21-Day Smoothie Diet program, downloaded the shopping list, and actually prepped everything in advance (which, if you knew her, is shocking). The rules?

‚úÖ Replace two meals a day with smoothies

‚úÖ Eat one solid meal + two snacks

‚úÖ No processed junk, but plenty of variety

**The Results: From ‚ÄúThis Won‚Äôt Work‚Äù to ‚ÄúWait, What?‚Äù**

**Week 1: The Jeans Zipper Test**

She lost 4 pounds in the first seven days.

Her cravings for late-night chips? Almost gone.

Energy levels? Up‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt need her usual afternoon coffee fix.

By Day 7, she tried on her ‚Äútight jeans‚Äù again, and‚Ä¶ they fit.

**Week 2: The Skin Glow-Up & Sugar Shock**

People at work started asking if she was using some fancy skincare. Nope‚Äîjust all those vitamins from the smoothies.

She also noticed something weird‚Äîher usual sweet tooth was fading. She tried to eat her go-to chocolate bar‚Ä¶ and didn‚Äôt even finish it. (Who is she?!)

**Week 3: The Big Reveal**

By the end of 21 days, she was down 11 pounds.

Her doctor literally asked, ‚ÄúWhat changed?‚Äù at her follow-up.

And the biggest flex? She didn‚Äôt even feel like she was dieting.

**What She Loved (And The Reality Check)**

‚úî Easy to Follow ‚Äì No counting calories or tracking macros. Just blend and drink.

‚úî Tastes Amazing ‚Äì The recipes weren‚Äôt ‚Äúgrass juice‚Äù level gross. Her fave? The chocolate almond smoothie.

‚úî No Hunger Crashes ‚Äì The fiber kept her full longer than she expected.

‚úî Better Sleep ‚Äì She didn‚Äôt expect this, but her sleep improved too.

‚ö† Not a Magic Fix ‚Äì You have to follow the plan. Skipping meals and ‚Äúcheating‚Äù a lot? Probably won‚Äôt work.

‚ö† Prep Is Key ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt have ingredients ready, it‚Äôs easy to fall off track.

‚ö† Post-21 Days Plan ‚Äì She kept having smoothies for breakfast even after the plan ended (she didn‚Äôt want to undo her progress).

**Final Thoughts: Worth It or Overhyped?**

Aunt Linda wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but this turned out to be the easiest way she‚Äôs ever lost weight without feeling miserable. She‚Äôs still having smoothies months later because, in her words, ‚ÄúIt just makes me feel good.‚Äù

So, if you‚Äôre looking for a simple way to reset your diet and actually see results, it might be worth a shot. Worst case? You try some new smoothie recipes. Best case? Your favorite jeans fit again. üòâ

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

But the issue is my 1Zpresso K-Plus. Grinding my coffee  on 
 ~0.2.6 setting (calibrated) is completely another level of morning workout. Is's kinda ok to grind medium roasted coffee (e.g. RL50), but last week I decided to buy RL70 roast and I realized that's the most enjoyable cup of coffee I had in a long time. So I definitely want to try even lighter roasts in the future. Which is definitely not something that would my 1Zpresso like to hear.

Grinding RL70 roast is so hard, that I usually rip of the wooden handle from the lever durinig grinding several times. So today I tried it to ""motorize"" it using my drill, which worked kinda well, but I am really scared of breaking it - it's still great and not really cheap grinder for filter/moka pot.

So I feel like if I want to drink coffee that I enjoy, it's time to invest into some electric grinder. I would prefer single dose grinder as I want to keep my coffee in the bag to keep it as fresh as possible. And I also feel like it would be good if it would be able to have more precise grind settings. 1Zpresso K-Plus have 22 microns per click and I sometimes feel that the correct setting is somewhere between 2 adjacent clicks.

Budget is $1000, but it could be slightly more if it would be really great product. I really like the aesthetics of the EG-1, but I still didn't win any lottery yet, so I have to go with something cheaper.",1,1739809754.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I am starting at the ceiling in perfect silence. The sun is bursting into my room. I can hear car horns going and the city rumbling outside. The world is waking up and is ready to go. I feel miserable.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù

I am an entrepreneur. I have done sales, started my own businesses, and I KNOW the game. There‚Äôs always ups and downs.

But why does it feel so shitty today?

I live in South America. So getting a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job isn‚Äôt an option. Minimum wage here is around $300 USD. But my business isn‚Äôt providing me the feeling of safety that it usually does.

As I lay there in my bed watching the ceiling fan going around and around, I feel a crushing pressure in my chest. I rub my hands through my hair repeatedly, and try to think my way out of this.

It‚Äôs days like these where I really feel lost. I want to be great. But sometimes it feels like I am fighting against my DNA.

The feeling of analysis paralysis is holding me in bed. I never sleep in, so the barrage of inner voice insults about that are coming wave after waves.

I decide enough is enough. I pull myself out of bed, walk to the bathroom, click on the light and look in the mirror.

‚ÄúHere we go again.‚Äù I say to myself as I apply toothpaste to the same toothbrush, to do the same thing, for the same result.

Once I brush my teeth, I feel a surge of motivation. The crisp minty flavour in my mouth gives an icy feeling every time I breathe in, It‚Äôs time to figure this out.

I love to read self improvement. So I grab a book called psycho-cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz.

The book is basically about visualization, and how you automatically move towards your mental pictures. As I burn through the book, I decide I am going to lay down and meditate. I am going to visualize and picture what I want from life and keep it there.

I lay down on the floor, take a big deep breath, and close my eyes.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting time.‚Äù A thought pops up

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to fail.‚Äù Another comes up. I feel like I am dodging artillery shells.

‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs going to see you fail miserably.‚Äù Another jabs in like a knife to the ribs.

My eyes burst open like I just fell to my death in a dream.¬†

This is not helping.

I decide that a nice long walk is in order. I just need to get some fresh air and maybe that will help.

I put in my AirPods, put on a breathable outfit, and head out to the streets of Medellin.

It‚Äôs beautiful. The architecture is very old, and the colour of the buildings are an off-orange hue. Like vintage bricks.

I am walking down the sidewalk, trying to avoid eye contact with people. But they keep looking at me and smiling.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I say in my head. ‚ÄúAm I wearing a dirty shirt?‚Äù

I look down at my black t-shirt and give it a few wipes for good measure. It‚Äôs clean, other than a few pieces of white fabric from a hoodie I was wearing over it.

The crushing feeling of pressure comes back. It feels like I am having a heart attack but at 50% power. It‚Äôs a slow, pulsating feeling in my chest area.

I take a deep breath, roll my shoulders back, and try to put on a brave face. After all, people have their own problems. Why would I want to bother them with mine?

After about 5 minutes of rolling my shoulders back and holding my body differently, I start to go on a journey in my mind.

I start to think about motivation, and how it works.

I remember hearing Tony Robbins talk about how humans are motivated by pain and pleasure.

They are motivated to pursue pleasure, and avoid pain.

As I walk along the cracked sidewalk, hearing the whizzing of city busses, motorcycles, and citizens speaking in Spanish over the afternoon cup of Colombian coffee, I start to think differently.

An idea hits me.

‚ÄúIf you fall and break your arm right now, the ONLY thing on your mind would be to go to the hospital. All of your stress about business, money, or whatever else you‚Äôre worried about won‚Äôt matter.‚Äù I say in my mind. As if from a different source than the one I woke up with.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true.‚Äù I respond in my head. ‚ÄúWhen you win, you party. When you lose, you ponder.‚Äù¬†

I notice a small shift in my mindset.¬†

This isn‚Äôt me manipulating my physiology to feel better, this is me finding real hope.

I realize that maybe avoiding pain isn‚Äôt the answer.

We spend so much time running away from the very thing that could help us. Or at least motivate us to help ourselves.

Pain will always be there. And sometimes that sucks.

But there‚Äôs nothing that hurts more,

The Paramour Estate, nestled within the enchanting Silver Lake area of Hollywood, is a captivating blend of rich history and exquisite luxury. Perched atop one of the highest points in Los Angeles, it unveils breathtaking views that sweep from downtown to the stunning San Gabriel Mountains and the glistening Pacific Ocean. This will be the cherished home of our contestants for the next ten weeks as they embark on an extraordinary journey in this fierce modeling competition. Each week one will be eliminated until there remains just one remarkable model who will emerge as the winner of *House of Modeling*. They will receive a truly incredible prize package that will be revealed soon.

The top ten models have moved into the Paramour Estate after the casting was finished and cliques have already started forming around the cool rock'n'roll girl Freja and the stylish ice queen Lily. There are six rooms in the estate with Lindsay Lohan, the host, taking the master bedroom leaving the ten girls to share the other five rooms. Freja chose to room with fellow music lover Issa who she connected with during casting over their mutual love for music, coffee, and cigarettes. Lily paired up with Maria after they quickly bonded over their passion for fashion on the bus ride to the mansion. Iris and Missy decided to share a room because they're a bit more mature and laid-back than some of the others. Crystal and Edita also chose to room together since they're both beauty queens. Hiandra and Emily ended up sharing a room because there weren‚Äôt many other options. Hiandra felt hurt that Issa didn't pick her as a roommate since they quickly became friends during casting, but over the past week, Issa has become closer to Freja, leaving Hiandra feeling left out.

After getting settled in the models excitedly headed out to their first photoshoot where they were warmly greeted by the enchanting Lindsay Lohan who was radiating confidence in a sleek power blazer and a stunning green sequin gown, her beautiful wavy hair cascading elegantly and her crimson lipstick adding an alluring touch.

""It's wonderful to see all of you again! You were chosen to be here because I believe in each of you and know you have what it takes to succeed! This competition will be challenging and I hope you've settled in at the house because it's going to be an amazing first week! Your first photoshoot is going to be incredible! I have some exciting news, too: each week the photoshoot will draw inspiration from different parts of my work or personal life. This week's theme is taken from my thriller film *I Know Who Killed Me*. We're going to explore the chilling world of women in danger for the first photoshoot. I want your pictures to capture that intense feeling of a suspenseful thriller. Each shot should feel like a scene from a movie, drawing viewers into a mysterious world filled with tension and intrigue! The public will rank the photos from best to worst and during the callout ceremony I'll reveal the bottom three. Those three will face a challenge and their performances in the challenge will also be ranked. The model among the bottom three who scores the best in this challenge will earn immunity from being eliminated. The model of the bottom two with the worst callout average score will be eliminated.""

The models felt a mixture of tension, nerves, and excitement as they prepared for their first photoshoot. Everyone hoped to avoid being the first to leave but ultimately one unlucky model will have to be the one to go home first. Each model fervently wishes it won't be her. They all poured their heart and soul into the initial photoshoot, eager to shine and excel. Let's take a look at each model's performance for week 1's photoshoot:

After wrapping up the photoshoot the models made their way back to the house buzzing with excitement while the public eagerly ranked the photos from best to worst. Inside the house the models shared their thoughts discussing how they felt they performed and the vibe was overwhelmingly positive as they each received encouraging feedback about their shots. Yet a flicker of anxiety lingered in the air‚Äîwho could be the first to go home? Each model found themselves lost in contemplation, wondering who might face the heartbreak of elimination, especially since they all seemed to shine in their own way.

Later on in the evening Hiandra confided in Issa, her voice tinged with sadness, as she expressed feeling sad and left out since Issa didn't choose to room with her especially since they'd grown close during casting week. Issa offered her apologies but also mentioned how she had formed a bond with Freja too. Hiandra admitted her concern, saying she felt like Freja harbored some dislike for her since they hadn't talked as much during the casting week. Issa reassured her that Freja just takes time to warm up and once you initiate conversation she will gradually open up. As their conversation came to a close Issa retreated to her room where Freja awaited. Issa began to vent her frustrations about Hiandra, suggesting that Hiandra seemed almost obsessed with her since their first week together. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs really upset that I didn‚Äôt share a room with her, she took it so personally‚Äù Issa said. Freja chimed in, agreeing that Hiandra seemed a bit off, noting that she had appeared somewhat clingy during casting week, and they both shared a laugh over it. Little did they realize that Hiandra's roommate Emily was quietly eavesdropping from the slightly ajar door leading into the bedroom, standing flush against the wall in the dimly lit hallway beside it. Is she going to tell Hiandra what she's heard? Find out soon in the next part of this episode.

Please rank the photos from best to worst! You can DM me your votes or share them in this post. Thank you so much to everyone participating and I look forward to seeing how the competition plays out!

I found this coffee remarkably similar to the chocolate strudel, which makes sense since I think it is 90% the same. Bloomed for 1 min 10s at 85C, and then poured to weight at 94C. Beyond the tasting notes, I felt like these coffees were the food commercial versions of ""normal"" coffee. They tasted like a better version of a cup with very typical coffee characteristics like smooth chocolate and red fruit notes, but without expected bitterness. I was overall quite impressed by these two and look forward to trying cinnamon leche later, as I'm pretty sure it is what makes up 10% of ember.",3,1739808937.0,coffeerotation,1,1.0,False
1irnig0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1irnig0/allinclusive_resort_rant/,All-Inclusive Resort Rant,"Hi all, I‚Äôm a lifelong ARFID sufferer, long time lurker and first time poster and I just wanted to rant. 

I‚Äôm finishing up my first time in Mexico at an all-inclusive resort and it‚Äôs safe to say that I never want to go the all-inclusive route again. I was very discouraged by the lack of safe food options, even on the kids menu. I was stuck with either doing room service or one other restaurant and on Saturday after an all day tour in the heat and humidity, I was discouraged by the fact that not only was there one safe food I could eat on the room service menu, but also the fact that room service was going to take an hour plus. This on top of having to skip the lunch because of no safe food options and while I was ok and survived on snacks, I just really wanted some comfort food but didn‚Äôt want to wait because I needed sleep too. 

The worst part of my experience was last night when my boyfriend and I went back to a restaurant that we had had a good experience with only to get stuck with the worst waiter. When I tried to order cheese quesadillas off the kids menu the waiter was trying to mansplain to me that it was a kid menu item and that there was something else similar but it had beef (I can‚Äôt stand the texture of it and I love cows) and he was really rude about it. I was flabbergasted and my boyfriend had to try explaining to him that I had a condition and I was finally able to utter that I have medical condition and couldn‚Äôt eat certain foods. He apologized a couple times but it just left a really bad damper on the last night of our trip and I just felt really embarrassed. 

Another worst thing was the same foods not being available each day, like at the coffee shop and their pastry options. I just found I couldn‚Äôt rely on anywhere to be really consistent and I was just sad I couldn‚Äôt enjoy that part of the vacation as much. I don‚Äôt know if this is the case with other all-inclusive resorts or if I just picked a bad one? I‚Äôm just glad to be going home to the US where all my favorite foods are.
