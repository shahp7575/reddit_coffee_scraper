In my case, I think he got distracted, went on an extended coffee break, and forgot to come back. So, here I am, taking matters into my own hands and giving this a shot on Reddit!

# 📌 The Basics

👨‍💼 **Who I Am:** A 29-year-old Chartered Accountant, currently based in Bangalore. Numbers, balance sheets, and Excel sheets are my daily companions, but I promise I have a personality beyond financial statements!

* **Initials:** K
* **Age:** 29
* **Height:** 5’10""
* **Religion:** Hindu
* **Caste:** Prefer to keep this private for now, but we can talk
* **Reservation:** General category
* **Living with Parents:** No
* **Language:** Telugu is my mother tongue, English comes naturally to me, and while my Hindi isn’t perfect.

🚬 **Lifestyle Choices:** Never smoked, never drank – not because of any extreme stance, just a personal choice.

💘 **Relationship Status:** Never been in a relationship – maybe Cupid had other priorities, or maybe I was too busy reconciling accounts. Either way, I’m ready to change that.

# 💼 Work Life

💰 **Income:** ₹18L p.a.  
📜 **Education:** Chartered Accountant (CA)  
**🗺️Location:** Bangalore

# 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 About My Family

I come from an upper middle-class family.

👨‍💼 **Dad:** Central Government Employee  
👩‍👧 **Mom:** Homemaker  
👦**Siblings:** 1 Younger Brother

# 🏡 Living Arrangements

We’d be living separately in the initial years, but I plan to stay with my parents later. Family is important to me, and I believe in being there for them while also building a strong partnership with my future spouse.

# 🛠️ Partnership & Responsibilities

I see relationships as a partnership where both people support each other. There’s no fixed formula for splitting responsibilities—some days, one of us might carry more weight, and other days, the roles will reverse. What matters is that we both contribute, whether by sharing chores or bringing in help when needed. A relationship should feel like teamwork, not a second job for just one person.

# 💰 Financial Compatibility Matters

I value financial stability and mindful spending, prioritizing savings over splurging on unnecessary luxuries. I believe in living comfortably but practically, making thoughtful financial decisions that secure our future rather than chasing fleeting extravagance. If you share a similar approach to money, we’ll be a great match.

# 🎭 Beyond the Numbers

While work keeps me busy, I have a life beyond Excel sheets. I appreciate deep conversations and binge-worthy movies and series.

# ❤️ What I’m Looking For

I’m **dating to marry**—not here for casual flings, half-hearted effort, or “let’s see where this goes.” If you’re emotionally available, intentional, and genuinely ready to build a future, keep reading!

* **Smoking & Drinking:** NOPE
* **Marriage Timeline:** Ideally in 2026, but no rush.
* **Location:** Bangalore, and I am also open for Hyderabad.
* **Matrimony Profiles**: Not created yet.

1k8u2l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1k8u2l8/sudden_migraine_escalation/,Sudden Migraine escalation,"I’m experiencing a rather dramatic departure from my usual migraine activity.

For reference, I (34M) have experienced migraines since I was 15. Depending on the year/month, I average one migraine lasting 8-12 hours every 2-3 months. Once when I was 16, I got two migraines on consecutive days. Throughout my mid-20s, there were entire years I didn’t get a migraine. In my more recent years, I’ve gone back to averaging one migraine again every 3 months or so.

Migraines were historically triggered by cheese and caffeine, however these haven’t been clear triggers for me since my early 20s. I’ve been able to consume a daily coffee without issues for half a decade now, whereas this previously wouldn’t be possible as a teenager. Migraines these days tend to be triggered by stressful periods and strong smells, but not with absolute certainty.

My symptoms are fairly classical: clear aura as a warning sign, developing into strong pounding pain across either one or both hemispheres; nausea and vomiting; intolerance of sound, light, and movement. They typically last 8-10 hours before subsiding into a mild movement-aggravated headache.

The departure that I’m experiencing is this: I’ve had five migraines in a week.

21st April - woke up, had a shower, immediately an aura began. I took my triptan medication and paracetamol, went back to bed, and was mostly fine 5 hours later. Pain was moderate. Nausea moderate.

24th April - migraine started around 1pm. Clear aura developed. Took Triptans and paracetamol. Pain behind the left and right eye socket was moderate. No nausea. Was fine 4 hours later

26th April - awoke with a pounding headache. No aura in vision initially. Pain clearly over the left eye socket this time. Almost resolved within three hours, however, then I started to get an aura to signal a second migraine was coming. The second migraine was whole left hemisphere, with severe pain. This one lasted 5 hours and included lots of vomiting.

27th April (this morning) - awoke to my morning alarm with a mild 1/10 headache. Initially checked my vision for any aura but there was nothing there. Got out of bed and turned on my light, and immediately an aura begins. Took my triptan medications again, and went back to bed. No pain this time. Awoke 3 hours later and am feeling fine again.

This recent history is a massive departure from my long-term history, and also from my usual signs and symptoms profile (no triggers present, different duration, different pain severity, different locations). The only clear similarity is the aura I experience beforehand. This feels like a mix of migraine activity and cluster headaches, but it doesn’t match perfectly with either diagnosis…?

Any ideas on how I can possibly manage this? I’m lost and nervous about what this means for me moving forward. I also don’t want to get myself in trouble with taking triptans too frequently.",1,1745722503.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

1k8tw92,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlogsAtTiffanys/comments/1k8tw92/aileen_wuornos/,Aileen Wuornos,"Preface: They labeled Aileen America’s first female serial killer though she was neither the first or the worst. Though she did have a “masculine” approach to homicide most would say. She is suspected of at least seven murders and sentenced to die in four out six of those cases that she confessed to police. She did insist that some, if not all were done in self defense, resisting violent assaults from men she solicited while working as a sex worker. Though, only one case was shown where her story may have been true.  

Aileen was born Aileen Carol Pittman in Rochester, Michigan on February 29, 1956. Her teenage parents separated months before she was born. Her father Leo Pittman moving on to serve time in Kansas and Michigan as a deranged child molester. He committed suicide by hanging himself in prison. Her mother Diane Pratt recalls Aileen and her brother as “crying, unhappy babies”, and that caused her to abandon them with her parents in 1960. On March 18, 1960 Aileen’s maternal grandparents Lauri and Britta Wuornos legally adopted the children. 

Aileen’s childhood showed little to no improvements there. By six she had suffered scarring burns to her face when she and her brother were setting fires with lighter fluid. Aileen later disclosed to police she slept with her brother at a young age but friends say otherwise and he is unable to speak for himself as he passed in 1976. Aileen however was having sex with someone since she became pregnant at 14. Although, by 11 she was prostituting herself out at school to students for drugs, cigarettes, and food. She had her son on March 23, 1971. She gave him away in a closed adoption. On July 7, 1971 her grandmother died, although it was suspected to be liver failure Diane believed it to be her father of murder. Diane claimed her father threatened to kill her and her kids if they weren’t removed from his home. 

Aileen and her brother at that point became wards of the court. Aileen dropped out of school to work the streets full time as a teenage sex worker drifting across country. In May 1974 Aileen was using the alias “Sandra Kretsch” she was jailed in Jefferson County, Colorado for disorderly conduct, drunk driving, and firing a .22 caliber pistol from a moving vehicle. Additional charges were added for failure to appear. Back in Michigan on July 13, 1976 Aileen was arrested in Antrim County for simple assault and disturbing the peace after throwing a cue ball at a bartenders head. She also had outstanding warrants in Troy, Michigan for driving without a license and consuming alcohol in a motor vehicle. On August 4, 1976 Aileen settled her debt of $105 to society. 

The money came indirectly from her brothers death on July 17, 1976  his death left her with a life insurance payment of $10,000. Of which Aileen wasted in two months on luxuries. One of which was a new car she wrecked pretty quickly. Finding herself broke again nearing late September she hitchhiked a ride to Florida. It may have been a change of scenery but she was still Aileen and the law was still the law. 

On May 20, 1981 Aileen was arrested in Edgewater, Florida for armed robbery of a convenience store. Aileen was sentenced to prison time for this on May 4, 1982, being released 13 months later on June 30, 1983. Her next arrest on May 1, 1984 was for trying to pass forged checks at a bank. On November 30, 1985 she was named as a suspect in the theft of a postal and ammunition in Pasco County. She used the alias “Lori Grody” from an aunt in Michigan. 11 days later Florida Highway Patrol cited Aileen (posing as Grody) for driving without a valid license. On January 4, 1986 Aileen was arrested in Miami as Aileen, for auto theft, resisting arrest, and obstruction with false information. The police found a .38 caliber revolver and a box of ammunition in the stolen car. On June 2, 1986 Volusia County detained Aileen posing as Grody for questioning after a male friend of hers accused her of pulling a gun on him and demanding $200. Despite her refusal of the situation Aileen was carrying spare ammunition and a .22 pistol was hidden under the seat she was in in the car. Aileen created a new alias “Susan Blahovec” she was ticketed for speeding in Jefferson County, Florida. Her citation included “Attitude poor. Thinks she’s above the law.”. 

This is when Tyria Moore met Aileen in a gay bar in Daytona. They quickly became lovers but the passion faded over a year, they remained friends and traveling companions. They became inseparable over the next four years. On July 4, 1987 police detained “Susan Blahovec” and “Tina Moore” for questioning on suspicion of hitting a man with a beer bottle. “Blahovec” (Aileen) was alone with a patrolman cited her for walking on the interstate and possessing a suspended license on December 18, 1987. Once again her citation read “attitude poor” and “Blahovec” proved it over two months with threatening letters letters mailed to the circuit clerk on January 11 and February 9, 1988. 

A month later Aileen had a new approach and alias. On March 12, 1988 “Cammie Marsh Greene” accused a Daytona bus driver of attacking her, claiming he pushed her off the bus following an argument. Tyria Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. On July 23, 1988 a Daytona landlord accused Moore and “Blahovec” of vandalizing their apartment, ripping out carpets, and painting the walls dark brown without approval. In November 1988 “Blahovec” made a six day attack of threatening calls against a Zephyrhills market, over an incident with lottery tickets. 

By 1989 Aileen was just belligerent and erratic. She never took an insult lightly, she would go out of her way to provoke arguments, and always had a loaded pistol in her purse. She would hang out at bars and truck stops, hitchhiking rides to snag a sex work deal when all else failed. So she used theft to supplement her sex work income. More and more with Tyria she talked about all the wrongs in her life and wanting revenge. 

Richard Malloy, victim one. A 51 year old electrician from Palm Harbor. He was last seen alive by coworkers on November 30, 1989. His car was found abandoned at Ormond Beach the next day, his wallet and papers nearby, several condoms, and a half bottle of vodka. On December 13, 1989 his fully dressed corpse was found in the woods north of Daytona shot three times with a .22 pistol. In searching for a motive police discovered he’d been divorced five times, and had the reputation of being paranoid, a heavy drinker, and very much into the porno/topless bar scene. He had no criminal record though despite being described as mental. 

The investigation stalled on June 1, 1990 when a nude victim was found, shot six times with a .22, and dumped in the woods 40 miles north of Tampa. By June 7, the corpse had been identified by dental records as 43 year old David Spears, last seen leaving his job in Sarasota on May 19. Spears planned on visiting his ex in Orlando that afternoon but he didn’t make up. His boss saw his missing pick up on May 25, but then the trail went cold. 

By the time Spears was identified the third victim had shown up. Charles Carskaddon, 40, was a part time rodeo worker from Booneville, Missouri, missing since May 31. He vanished along I-75 on his way to meet his fiancé in Tampa. His naked corpse found 30 miles south of the Spears murder site on June 6. He had been shot nine times with a .22 pistol. This suggested a pattern even to those who resisted the idea of a serial killer at large. On June 7 Charles car was found in Marion County, a .45 semiautomatic and personal items were stolen from the car. 

Peter Siems, 65, a merchant seaman turned missionary was seen last on June 7, 1990. He left his Jupiter, Florida home to see family in Arkansas. When he never arrived a missing person report was filed on June 22. No trace of him had been found by July 4 when his car was wrecked and abandoned in Orange Springs, Florida. Witnesses described the occupants of the car as two women one blond and one brunette. The blond was injured and bleeding and police were able to life a bloody palmprint from the vehicles trunk. 

Eugene Burress, 50, left the Ocala sausage factory where he worked to make his delivery rounds on July 30, 1990. A missing person report was filed when he hadn’t returned by 2am the next day and his delivery van was found two hours later. On august 4 his fully dressed body was found by a family picnicking in the Ocala National Forest. He had been shot twice by a .22 pistol in the back and chest. Nearby police found his credit cards, receipts, and an empty cash bag from a local bank. 

Dick Humphreys, 56, was a retired Alabama police chief who had been employed by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to investigate child abuse claims in Ocala. His wife filed a missing person report when he failed to return home from work on the night of September 11, 1990. He was found the next day in an undeveloped subdivision, shot seven times with a .22 pistol his pants pockets turned inside out. On September 19 his car was found abandoned and stripped of plates behind a service station in Live Oak. It was impounded on September 25 and not traced back to Humphreys until October 13, the same day his badge and other belongings were found in Lake County, 70 miles southeast of the murder. 

Walter Antonio, 60, a trucker from Merritt Island who doubled as police reserve for Brevard County. Found in the woods northwest of Cross City on November 19, 1990,  he had been shot three times in the back and once in the head. He was nude but for his socks, his clothes were later found in a remote area near Taylor County. His car was found in Brevard County on November 24. Police said that his killer had stolen a distinctive gold ring along with his badge, nightstick, handcuffs, and flashlight. 

On January 16, 1991 Aileen summoned detectives and confessed to the six killings, allegedly done in self defense. Within two weeks of her arrest her attorney had sold the rights to her story for a movie. A bizarre sideshow of media became about this case which is why I left some details out. Aileen was given the death sentence and maintained her innocence that it was all self defense till the end. After nine years on death row Aileen stopped all her appeals. In April 2001 she asked them expedite her process on death row. Even in one interview recanting her self defense approach to the case. The state Supreme Court approved her decision to fire her attorneys on April 1, 2002. She was executed by lethal injection six months later on October 9, 2002. She declined her last meal, only asking for a cup of coffee. Her last words were “Yes, I would just like to say I’m sailing with the rock, and ill be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus.”.

Despite her refusal of the situation Aileen was carrying spare ammunition and a .22 pistol was hidden under the seat she was in in the car. Aileen created a new alias “Susan Blahovec” she was ticketed for speeding in Jefferson County, Florida. Her citation included “Attitude poor. Thinks she’s above the law.”. 

This is when Tyria Moore met Aileen in a gay bar in Daytona. They quickly became lovers but the passion faded over a year, they remained friends and traveling companions. They became inseparable over the next four years. On July 4, 1987 police detained “Susan Blahovec” and “Tina Moore” for questioning on suspicion of hitting a man with a beer bottle. “Blahovec” (Aileen) was alone with a patrolman cited her for walking on the interstate and possessing a suspended license on December 18, 1987. Once again her citation read “attitude poor” and “Blahovec” proved it over two months with threatening letters letters mailed to the circuit clerk on January 11 and February 9, 1988. 

A month later Aileen had a new approach and alias. On March 12, 1988 “Cammie Marsh Greene” accused a Daytona bus driver of attacking her, claiming he pushed her off the bus following an argument. Tyria Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. On July 23, 1988 a Daytona landlord accused Moore and “Blahovec” of vandalizing their apartment, ripping out carpets, and painting the walls dark brown without approval. In November 1988 “Blahovec” made a six day attack of threatening calls against a Zephyrhills market, over an incident with lottery tickets. 

By 1989 Aileen was just belligerent and erratic. She never took an insult lightly, she would go out of her way to provoke arguments, and always had a loaded pistol in her purse. She would hang out at bars and truck stops, hitchhiking rides to snag a sex work deal when all else failed. So she used theft to supplement her sex work income. More and more with Tyria she talked about all the wrongs in her life and wanting revenge. 

Richard Malloy, victim one. A 51 year old electrician from Palm Harbor. He was last seen alive by coworkers on November 30, 1989. His car was found abandoned at Ormond Beach the next day, his wallet and papers nearby, several condoms, and a half bottle of vodka. On December 13, 1989 his fully dressed corpse was found in the woods north of Daytona shot three times with a .22 pistol. In searching for a motive police discovered he’d been divorced five times, and had the reputation of being paranoid, a heavy drinker, and very much into the porno/topless bar scene. He had no criminal record though despite being described as mental. 

The investigation stalled on June 1, 1990 when a nude victim was found, shot six times with a .22, and dumped in the woods 40 miles north of Tampa. By June 7, the corpse had been identified by dental records as 43 year old David Spears, last seen leaving his job in Sarasota on May 19. Spears planned on visiting his ex in Orlando that afternoon but he didn’t make up. His boss saw his missing pick up on May 25, but then the trail went cold. 

By the time Spears was identified the third victim had shown up. Charles Carskaddon, 40, was a part time rodeo worker from Booneville, Missouri, missing since May 31. He vanished along I-75 on his way to meet his fiancé in Tampa. His naked corpse found 30 miles south of the Spears murder site on June 6. He had been shot nine times with a .22 pistol. This suggested a pattern even to those who resisted the idea of a serial killer at large. On June 7 Charles car was found in Marion County, a .45 semiautomatic and personal items were stolen from the car. 

Peter Siems, 65, a merchant seaman turned missionary was seen last on June 7, 1990. He left his Jupiter, Florida home to see family in Arkansas. When he never arrived a missing person report was filed on June 22. No trace of him had been found by July 4 when his car was wrecked and abandoned in Orange Springs, Florida. Witnesses described the occupants of the car as two women one blond and one brunette. The blond was injured and bleeding and police were able to life a bloody palmprint from the vehicles trunk. 

Eugene Burress, 50, left the Ocala sausage factory where he worked to make his delivery rounds on July 30, 1990. A missing person report was filed when he hadn’t returned by 2am the next day and his delivery van was found two hours later. On august 4 his fully dressed body was found by a family picnicking in the Ocala National Forest. He had been shot twice by a .22 pistol in the back and chest. Nearby police found his credit cards, receipts, and an empty cash bag from a local bank. 

Dick Humphreys, 56, was a retired Alabama police chief who had been employed by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to investigate child abuse claims in Ocala. His wife filed a missing person report when he failed to return home from work on the night of September 11, 1990. He was found the next day in an undeveloped subdivision, shot seven times with a .22 pistol his pants pockets turned inside out. On September 19 his car was found abandoned and stripped of plates behind a service station in Live Oak. It was impounded on September 25 and not traced back to Humphreys until October 13, the same day his badge and other belongings were found in Lake County, 70 miles southeast of the murder. 

Walter Antonio, 60, a trucker from Merritt Island who doubled as police reserve for Brevard County. Found in the woods northwest of Cross City on November 19, 1990,  he had been shot three times in the back and once in the head. He was nude but for his socks, his clothes were later found in a remote area near Taylor County. His car was found in Brevard County on November 24. Police said that his killer had stolen a distinctive gold ring along with his badge, nightstick, handcuffs, and flashlight. 

On January 16, 1991 Aileen summoned detectives and confessed to the six killings, allegedly done in self defense. Within two weeks of her arrest her attorney had sold the rights to her story for a movie. A bizarre sideshow of media became about this case which is why I left some details out. Aileen was given the death sentence and maintained her innocence that it was all self defense till the end. After nine years on death row Aileen stopped all her appeals. In April 2001 she asked them expedite her process on death row. Even in one interview recanting her self defense approach to the case. The state Supreme Court approved her decision to fire her attorneys on April 1, 2002. She was executed by lethal injection six months later on October 9, 2002. She declined her last meal, only asking for a cup of coffee. Her last words were “Yes, I would just like to say I’m sailing with the rock, and ill be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus.”.

She's my go to person, she's like my human journal because I tell her everything and she does the same to me (I think?). 

We have our disagreements before but we always agree to disagree, we compromise. I knew her and she knew me. It's weird that we sometimes think of the same things and realize later that we're thinking the exact same thing, it's like we are the same person with different bodies. 

And then suddenly she just never replies to me, she never replies to the reel I sent her, she never commented on the things that I sent to group chats we were both in, she never reacts or commented or even views my stories in all social media platforms. 

I messaged her why she never response to me anymore, said my sorry but she just didn't reply. 

I know I'm not perfect as a friend but I never thought that she'll just leave without saying a word. I just wished that she would tell me what I did and I would totally understand if she cannot have me as a friend anymore, I just want closure.

it always tastes grainy with max bitterness. with some medium to strong grass notes.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/bIhpl9X)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

I read some posts with people trying to work out if it was worth it. I can say at least at this point it is definitely not. We have stayed club level at the Portofino and the Hard Rock Cafe. In both cases they were so much better. 

let me list the reasons why you should not stay club level: 

1) The club is on the freeway side not the parkside so no view. I find this very odd given where Disney concierge is placed in their deluxe hotels in a way which emphasizes the view.
2) The gentleman at the door just completely ignored me for 15 minutes as I was trying to get in. He was just playing at his computer. 
3) The coffee machine only seemed to dispense vanilla coffee. I asked one of the attendants whether or not it could be fixed and she said no  have no idea how to fix it.
4) She also emphasized that the coffee machine was only programmed to have coconut milk. 
5) The club level lounge visual appeal is of a very tragic break room as a paper company in Scranton PA. There were just some very uncomgotable chairs and no sense of luxury whatsoever. Overlooking the freeway with  employees you clearly did not want to be there. 


I think in the end the club level at universal is very very rarely worth it, but out the Helios it is so not worth it. I hope this helps someone else. I had been hoping that by booking club level it might be better than at the other hotels, but it was so much worse! Given the structural defects of the club and its position, I can't imagine much changing out of preview time though perhaps the staff training may improve.

Hello! Help a student out, huehue.

My groupmates and I are beginners. I think we are missing a step or doing something differently in making paper with corn husks, coconut husks, and banana fibers. Based on the comments in this sub, it seems we've been doing it differently. Can you guys help us figure out what the problems are in our process and why we can't produce good paper? Mostly, it looks like cardboard, or the paper breaks easily.

Here's our process:

1. We shred the fibers with a coffee bean grinder to cut them into small pieces or pulverize them.
2. We boil the fibers in a pot with a mixer. The only additive we use is baking soda (I guess we thought it could be an alternative to a blender?).
3. After some time, we transfer the boiled fibers into another basin with water and cornstarch combined. Sometimes, we just use water.
4. This is where it gets tricky: we put fabric inside the deckle and do the molding process.
5. We press the fibers with another fabric on top (like a sandwich), then put some flat, heavy materials to remove the excess water.
6. After that, we remove the top fabric and proceed to dry the paper directly under the sunlight.

After lurking in this sub, I found out that it should be soda ash. Also, do I need to soak the fibers overnight first? Help us, please! Any recommendations and tips are much appreciated.",1,1745720297.0,papermaking,1,1.0,False

1k8tcd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout_and_diet/comments/1k8tcd7/nutrition_gout/,"Nutrition, Gout,","This is one of several incoming posts and this one is mostly written from a dietary perspective. Other posts will be from inflammatory responses and cycles as I've researched them in regards to some of the terms below relating to inflammatory markers. It's hard to split these as they blend so much and so many potential factors bleed into one another and everyone has their own unique sequence of scenarios.  While I recommend attempting to stick to a whole food plant based diet - this is just a storyboard of information and potential scenarios with a bias towards gout, serum uric acid, etc. 

Below you will occasionally see ""search: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" which you can search to see the results I got as there is so much more info available. 

Gout is far more complex than someone saying to avoid seafood, alcohol, and beef as I'm sure you're well aware of. Unfortunately, you have to read labels, look for ingredients you can't pronounce, are highly refined, and redefine your pallet and intentionally eat healthier or deal with many hidden aspects of hyperuricemia or go the route of ULT meds. My hope is to help folks see the deep relationship between our food and our health. You'll also notice most studies will talk about the positive impact of some food/dietary means and how they hope to replicate it in medication.

Increase: Fruits, vegetables, whole foods; see guide above 

Decrease: enriched/fortified foods/flours, additives, added sugars, saturated fats, oils, lunch meat, coffee, tea (green, black, herbal, white, etc), caffeine, \*\*supplements; I personally avoid dairy but ymmv

\*\*Supplements may have their place but the idea is to source these things from whole foods.

**Conclusions and relevance:** Results of this study suggest that cereal fiber intake was associated with lower levels of various inflammatory markers and lower risk of CVD and that inflammation mediated approximately one-sixth of the association between cereal fiber intake and CVD.

6. Conclusions and perspectives: The results of epidemiological and experimental studies on high-fiber dietary intervention both indicated beneficial improvements of clinical and microbiome outcomes. Gut microbial ecology is largely regulated by the human diet, especially available component, and high fiber intake has been associated with elevated levels of Prevotella \[[132](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590097822000209#bib132)\].

This above (Prevotella and other bacteriums) is an insane rabbit hole and needs more research.

Searched ""What is cereal fiber""

Cereal fiber refers to the indigestible parts of cereal grains like wheat, oats, and rice, that are part of the outer layer of the grain called the bran. These fibers, including beta-glucan, arabinoxylan, and cellulose, are a type of dietary fiber that offers various health benefits, particularly for digestive health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. \[[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3708330/), [2](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-it-comes-to-fiber-cereal-fiber-may-be-your-best-choice-201102251535), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7599874/#:~:text=Whole%20grains%20of%20cereals%20and%20pseudo%2Dcereals%20are,e.g.%2C%20cellulose%2C%20arabinoxylan%2C%20%CE%B2%2Dglucan%2C%20xyloglucan%20and%20fructan.&text=Cereals%20are%20an%20important%20source%20of%20dietary,dietary%20fibre%20intake%20in%20Western%20countries%20[30].), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3145818/#:~:text=Cereal%20fibre%20and%20whole%2Dgrain%20intakes%20have%20been,including%20obesity%2C%20CVD%20and%20type%202%20diabetes.&text=Commonly%20used%20cereal%20grains%2C%20including%20wheat%2C%20maize,rice%2C%20are%20major%20sources%20of%20insoluble%20fibre.)\] 

I do old fashioned organic oats most mornings with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and occasionally strawberries - and add a few raisins and 1.5 tbsp chia seeds. 

Compare this to enriched flour which is found in many snacky foods that are shelf stable - many of these metabolize quickly and can be stored as fat because of the sugar spike and the way your liver can't handle all that sugar at once.

This title seems misleading as it states in the article: ""Consumption of whole grains was significantly and inversely associated with hs-CRP concentrations across the menstrual cycle in this cohort of young, healthy women. Furthermore, women who consumed ≥1 serving/d of whole grain had a significantly lower probability of having a moderate or elevated hs-CRP categorization (based on AHA criteria). The associations remained significant after adjustment for various other demographic characteristics, metabolic variables, and dietary factors. These results highlight the benefits of even moderate whole grain intake as part of a healthy diet. Furthermore, this association raises the possibility of using whole grains as a potential, effective intervention to protect against the adverse reproductive outcomes associated with elevated hs-CRP in reproductive-aged women.""

Search: liver excess sugar crp

AI Overview: Excessive sugar intake, particularly fructose, is linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and can increase C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a marker of inflammation. The liver processes fructose, and high fructose consumption can lead to fat accumulation, contributing to NAFLD. Elevated CRP, often associated with liver inflammation, can be a consequence of this fat buildup. 

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10629746/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10629746/)

""In conclusion, NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and is strongly associated with the metabolic conditions of insulin resistance, T2D, and obesity. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD is linked to the rise of sugar consumption; therefore, dietary strategies incorporating restriction may provide an effective disease prevention and treatment solution. While the role of dietary sugar in NAFLD pathogenesis is still being elucidated, current consumption levels surpass the World Health Organization's guideline of no more than 10% of total energy intake. Given the health and economic impact of NAFLD, it's crucial to reduce free sugar intake to alleviate the current burden and prevent future obesity-related comorbidities.""

I'm here in search for advice on how to navigate life with my Mother and Sister. We've never disagreed on anything and have similar political views - we were insanely close up until now and I'll try to sum up the situation as quickly as possible.  
  On my birthday in November of last year we got into a huge fight and since then, I'm on eggshells. They brought up Russia threatening nuclear war and I said ""Well, if it's between getting blown to bits or minding our business, I think we should mind our business"". My sister started screaming at me, saying I was heartless and that I should think of the children and innocent people dying. I told her that I'm not ignorant to the suffering of others but I have a one year old who's completely turned my world upside down and, yeah, I'd vouch to save him before anyone else. My sister continued to yell at me as I sat there bewildered at how things escalated and, eventually, I got upset enough that I said ""If you're so angry, then why aren't you overseas doing something about it?"". She then stormed out of my house and slammed the door. I KNOW this wasn't a nice thing to say and have since apologized for it. I was upset because she's 27 years old, has my mom pay all of her bills, her brand new car is in my mom's name that she almost let get repossessed, she spends 99% of her free time on tiktok and traveling around instead of helping my mom with bills or helping her clean or anything. She also attacks people online for their political views or what she \*assumes their political views are and I had enough. I never snap and I'm pretty much always neutral so I was even surprised that I said what I did. My Mom apologized for things getting out of hand and, while crying, I told her that I didn't mean to make her upset but that I also think that I should be able to say that I don't want a nuclear war without being screamed at. Even though my Mom seemed empathetic at the time, I received a text from her that night telling me, a 30 year old woman, to apologize because I was out of line. She then called me the next day, my own mother, and told me that she didn't even know who I was anymore - all because of this one incident. I sent them a message stating that I care for people, I don't want to see others suffering but, yes, if we have a choice, I stand by what I said. My sister ignored me for weeks, responded that I was ignorant and we'll never be close again. I said that maybe we should avoid politics but my sister said that was even worse because politics were important and we should all share our views. The two people I'm the closest to jumped to insane conclusions because of one comment so, no, I didn't want to talk about politics anymore. I was trying to me mindful, kind and understanding in my response - I asked her to tell me why I was ignorant, that I'm genuinely trying to understand and grow as a person every day but was left on read for another 3 weeks. Honestly, I haven't been able to sleep since. Their silence broke me down and I spent weeks an anxious wreck because I thought I lost my family over one thing I said that they disagreed with. I think it was the first time I really voiced my disagreement as well.  
Since then, things have cooled down but I vowed to not talk about politics with them since they literally almost kicked me out of the family. My mom and sister, however, can't get through one conversation without it being about about some doomsday political ideal - ""we're going to be enslaved, the country is run by n\*zis, RFK wants to kill all special needs people, people who voted blue are being taken to warehouses and killed"". I - yeah. Lately, it's been worse with my mom going through literally 45 different horrible things in an hour (I wish I was exaggerating) to the point where I'm so overloaded with information that I'm getting anxious and overwhelmed. And it's EVERY conversation - ""I want to start a coffee shop"" is met with ""Well you're a woman and Trump doesn't want women running their own business"". ""I had a dream about my son wearing this cute outfit"" is met with ""Oh well I'm stockpiling clothes and other items because the tariffs are so high we won't have clothes for him"".  
It's exhausting. I love them so much but the doom scrolling and over consumption of media is beyond toxic and unhealthy - my Mom can't sleep much less even have a conversation with me without dumping her anxiety about fascist n\*zi America. It's a lot, I don't agree with her and I feel like I can't say anything without risking our relationship.  
I'm trying to give her grace and understanding. I understand that with what she's consuming via social media, it's easy to be an anxious mess and those feelings are real. I just don't know how to move forward without risking losing her and my sister. I'm worried for them. I don't want to lose my relationship, I'm afraid if I say ""no politics please"" that they'll jump to conclusions about me being an evil person (I know that sounds insane but - ) and even though I sit and listen and just throw in a ""damn that's crazy"" it's getting to be too much.  
Are any of you going through the same thing? How do you navigate it? Also, I'm open to any and all responses as, like I've mentioned, I'm trying to grow and be better. Thank you in advance.",1,1745719777.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

**1. Superfans > Casual Listeners**  
One fan who buys your merch, tickets, or album is worth more than 10,000 random streams. Superfans sustain your career.

**2. Engagement Fuels Growth**  
It’s not just about plays. Comments, shares, and real interactions are what push your music to new audiences.

**3. Direct Support Pays More**  
Thousands of streams might barely pay for a coffee. One album sale or VIP ticket purchase brings real income.

**4. Own Your Audience**  
You don't own your streams — platforms do. But when you build email lists, Discord servers, or private communities, you own the connection.

**5. Long-Term Success Beats Viral Moments**  
Going viral is exciting, but fleeting. A loyal fanbase grows slowly — and sticks with you through every release.

Have you ever thought about how awesome life would be if you could just *automate* one thing? 🤖 I mean, think of it like programming little life-hacks that free up your time for the stuff that really matters—or maybe just binge-watching that new show guilt-free. 🙈

**Imagine this:**

You wake up in the morning, and **voilà**—your coffee is made, your to-do list is organized, and you even have that motivational playlist blasting in the background. Sounds dreamy, right? But let’s get real here—what’s the one thing you’d love to automate? Here are a few mind-blowing ideas I’ve been tossing around:

- **Daily tasks:** How amazing would it be if your chores could do themselves? Dishes, laundry, grocery shopping—all taken care of, leaving you with time for hobbies or, you know, just lounging on the couch guilt-free! 🛋️

- **Motivation reminders:** Imagine a personal cheerleader texting you every morning: “Get up! You got this! Time to conquer the day!” (Bonus points if they come with coffee!) ☕💪

- **Meal Prep:** If someone could automate the meal planning and prepping, we’d be set! No more last-minute takeout decisions. Just healthy meals ready to go. What’s not to love? 😋

- **Fitness tracking:** How about an app that not only counts your steps but actually drags you to the gym? *“Hey! Stop scrolling! Let’s do some squats!”* 🙃

- **Emotional well-being:** A personal AI that senses when you’re feeling down and cues up your favorite uplifting playlist or sends you motivational quotes to lift your spirits. Pretty cool, right? 🎶✨

Now, picture this: you’ve automated all the mundane stuff, and suddenly, you’ve got an extra *2 hours a day*. What would you do with that time? Would you finally pick up that hobby you’ve been putting off? Write a book? Or perhaps spend it with loved ones? ❤️

Let’s not kid ourselves: while automation sounds like a magical solution, it’s also a reminder that we have to strike a balance. Life is about the journey, right? The struggles, the learning, the victories—those are what make us grow.

So, if you could say goodbye to one part of life’s chaos, what would it be??? 

I’m all ears, friends! ✌️ Let’s share our automation dreams and maybe, just maybe, inspire each other to take that first step toward a little more time for what really matters!",1,1745719586.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1k8swq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1k8swq4/deadbeat_roommatefriend/,Deadbeat Roommate/Friend,"I (24M) wish i knew the “don’t live with your friends” before i let this pile of trash move in with me. Its a long one, so buckle up. 

So, April last year i let my friend from Uni, lets call him V, move in with me in my room. V is 26 M. I am international student and so is he. getting a decent place that has transit access and close to amenities, work and campus, at an affordable price is really difficult in the area that we live in. 


V used to live in the residence for the duration of his course, but moved out in April last year. 
I have had my own place ever since i moved here. I have always had a private room, and i like living space tidy and HABITABLE. i like it to be organised and can’t say extremely clean but still clean enough that i can eat my food while sitting on the floor. 


So when V and all of our other friends moved out of Uni Residence, i thought it’d be fun to have him live with me because i had grown pretty close to V and we were pretty great friends. Plus it would also help me bring down my rent and utilities. 
I wish i had known this sooner how much a literal trash eating raccoon this a-hole is. 


it started off small, with him leaving dirty dishes in the room, which i didn’t mind because im also a bit of slacker when it comes to doing dishes; but i always made sure that i take those dishes out and wash them, dry them and put them back by evening. Initially i was fine with it, but it started becoming more frequent and dirtier. He’d make coffee and leave the half drank cups lying around the room. Half eaten food in the dishes would just sit in the room for days. If he ate in the common area (the living room) he’d bring those dirty dishes inside the room and leave them there (probably because the other housemates wouldn’t appreciate his lazy ass leaving dirty f*king dishes in the common area) 


But i tolerated it, because he was a good friend. And he helped me out financially (by paying my share of the rent) when i was struggling badly to the point where i didn’t even know if i could be able to afford groceries. I felt like i owed him because he helped me out. 
he would use my kitchenware to cook (which i was fine with, as long as you clean it), and leave the food in there for days, which would start growing its own ecosystem in there. (im talking pressure cooker with “food” in it, left out for months straight) 
He would constantly leave pizza boxes, take out containers with half eaten food, take out bags, around the room. 


Now i thought he would at least clean it up soon but he never did. I would be the one constantly cleaning up the room and making it habitable, i would wash the dishes everyday just so i can eat food in something. 
Apart from that he had zero sense of personal hygiene as well. his dirty laundry would sit in a laundry basket for months. He wouldn’t shower for days, would never change the sheets or even his pillowcases. 


Shit hit the fan when i went to visit home for a month recently and when i came back, there was mould inside back wall of the closet. Now, i’ve lived in this place for over a year, and i have never heard of there being a mould problem at all. The landlord is really great and he takes the upkeep of the house really seriously, so it came as a surprise that there was mould in the room. when i inspected it, there was food items in a bag left inside the closet, which im assuming got in contact with moisture and led to the mould. I immediately moved my clothes away placed covering and protective padding to prevent it frok making OUR clothes infected. (his dumbass wasn’t even bothered by it; and continued to live with it, while i was away) 
But again i couldn’t confront him about anything, because i constantly felt like i can’t do it becauee i owe him. 


In the time that i have lived here my housemates have never had any issues with me, i mostly keep to myself, im on good terms with all of them. They’re all lovely people, they’re older and married and are really considerate. I clean the house, kitchen, bathroom, take out the trash whenever its my turn. i never let food rot in the fridge or the kitchen area, never left dirty cups and mugs and kitchenware around the room. But ever since he moved in, i and everyone in the house has been having those troubles.


Again, i don’t mind cleaning up at all (i know it sounds like im disrespecting myself) but i have two jobs, and one of them requires me to travel 5 hours total back and forth. I come home around midnight and i really just need a hygienic and clean place to come back to. Whereas, he doesn’t have a job, and asks his dad to help him financially. Don’t even get me started on his personal “life” if you can even call it that. 
I don’t want pile of dishes and dirty laundry and trash in the room when i come back after 11 hours of work and 5 hours of travel. I don’t want to go to the kitchen just to find that i have no spoons or forks or cups or plates, for me to eat my breakfast in. I don’t want to have dust and lint stuck to my carpeted floor of the room. 


I am utterly disgusted and seriously pissed off with him, its affecting my mental health severely and its making my daily life miserable. 
I dont know what to do. 


There’s so much more that’s making my life living with him intolerable and miserable but i don’t want this post to be any longer than it is.

Heading back in May, and will spend 7 - 8 days, likely around the Central, to Southern Jakarta area. Possibly Menteng.  

This time a friend of mine is flying in for a week as well, and I'm wanting to bring him around to some of my favorite places for food, though it appears some of them have closed since I last visited. 

Will bring him for some street food and traditional classics such as martabak and bajigur, and sekoteng to give him a taste of something different. Big fan of soto, the more coconutty the better, and ordering on Grab is hit or miss, so would love a reliable recommendation there as well. 

But also looking for recommendations on: 

\- Basque/San Sebastian cheesecake  

\- Any amazing bakeries? I used to love Joe & Dough, and Bakerman had some amazing yuzu flavors. Anything new that's a ""must try""? 

\- Authentic Japanese Udon  (Weird ask I know for Jakarta, but I've had several tell me there are some excellent Udon shops somewhere in Jakarta, but they couldn't tell me the name)

\- Coffee/Cafe - Any must visits? We usually go test out a few coffee shops plus seek out some good masala chai. 

\----- I just saw Gotham Treats is closing down! That was my go to for awesome Milk Tarts. Any other place similar to Gotham, or was it a one of a kind?

So pretty much open to any recommendations that'll show off the wide range of foods available. Will be pretty busy working most of the time, so we won't have much site seeing time, so might as well have some good food while we're at it.  Thanks in advance!

Hello, I will try my best to keep things concise but not overly specific/personal. So around 8 years ago my grandparents took my best friend in after his family fell apart and abandoned him. Up until last year this individual was very successful getting into a great school on a scholarship and being recognized as a real stand up person. You would have never known he had Aspergers. Then one day something snapped.

About 6 months ago my best friend started smoking weed pretty often (not his first time smoking but usually not to this extent). He suddenly started acting very erratic. He was known to be bipolar (not diagnosed that I know of but clear to anyone who knows what it looks like) but this behavior was remarkably different. Long story short he ended going missing for some time after being admitted into a psych ward. During this time he was out being very random buying tons of random items and buying people coffee. Once he made his way home he was mentally stable and back to normal. In the meantime he had dropped out of college and was trying to get his life back together.

Fast forward, he had started a new program at a local college. He was doing well until his birthday, where he went out drinking and smoking. The next morning he exploded on my grandmother, with aggressive language we have never seen. He was so threatening and behaviorally concerning that an emergency protection order was granted. He also just was put in jail for a short period after causing disruption at a local gym. The most concerning thing is his social media posts. He has posted very ominous and bizarre posts that elude to him getting some sort of revenge. One post repeating words such as “revenge” and “no mercy”

This all has been very distressing to my grandparents and I as we have no clue what he could do. His whereabouts are unknown. My grandma has lawyered up to ensure her protection order can be extended. I can’t help though to shake the anxiety though as this person is a stranger to me and I have no idea what he could thinking. He clearly has went into a mental state that I imagine has been influenced by his mental illness history and drug use.

The reason I’m here is because from what I gathered, he is having some manic episode or something along those lines. To give more details, he has fixated on random things such as bringing a stuffed Spider-Man everywhere he goes, putting stickers on his glasses, and carrying around a sonic suitcase everywhere. He buys things with credit cards and just never pays them. Currently has multiple protections orders put against him with a warrant out as well.  I understand it can be difficult to get people emergency help, but what resources are available? He never took any medication that I know of. Normally I’d never suspect he’d harm anyone, but his behavior is truly disturbing. I don’t know what’s happening or what to do for him",1,1745718563.0,family_of_bipolar,0,1.0,False

I want to share what has for me become a potent way to get myself ready for my morning meditation. I don't know if other have a similar approach, if so I'd love to hear about it.

I am a long time meditation practitioner (> 30 years).

It starts with the night before:

\- Sleep support (2 caps)  
\- Magnesium (micro-mag)

Then in the morning:

\- Berberine  
\- Resveratrol  
\- Andrographis  
\- Quercetin   
\- Shilajit

It's literally magic.   Super centering, since I've stumbled upon this combination, I've had the best at-home meditation/prayer practice of my life.  Of course the supplements don't do all of the work, but these seem to provide a very gentle opening to awareness of subtle energy flow.   

Thank you to Nootropics Depot for putting these all into the context where I could start to put this stack together.

He hasn’t taken me on any proper dates, which feels off.

I confronted him about it, and he said he doesn’t take women out on formal dates unless things are getting more serious, and that this is just how he operates in the early stages. He’s also on a strict meal plan for a diet, so he says that’s part of the reason we don’t go out for dinner or anything more “official.”

His texting pattern is also inconsistent. Sometimes he’s super present and messages me a lot throughout the day, and other times he’s clearly focused on his friends or busy and barely checks in. It leaves me feeling a bit uncertain. I’ve asked him directly if he’s seeing other people, and he told me he isn’t. He says he genuinely likes me and wants to see where this goes.

Some of my friends think he might not be over his ex or that he’s just not that into me and is stringing me along. But my gut tells me he’s not a bad guy—just a little emotionally unavailable or guarded. Still, I can’t help but feel like I’m accepting breadcrumbs and making excuses for the lack of effort.

So I guess I’m wondering:
Is this just how some guys approach dating seriously—slow and casual at first—or is this a red flag that he’s not emotionally available or not really invested?

Would love any insight from guys who’ve been in similar situations or know what this kind of behavior might actually mean.",2,1745717994.0,Advice,17,0.75,False

**Room Name/Type:** Vista Double Suite  
**Check-in Day:** Wednesday; staying three nights into Saturday (in mid April)  
**Check-in Time:** 5:00 pm

* We got an email a few days ahead of time asking for our arrival time.  Also stating check-in time was 3pm
* Our room was ready upon arrival, obviously we didn't get to take advantage of the early check-in
* Upon check-in we were asked if we needed the late check-out.  We did not (had a very early flight Saturday)

**Upgrade:** Was not upgraded, was told our room had a city view.

* If you look at the types of rooms, I think an upgrade from this level room is very unlikely.  Over-generalizing here, but there basically seems to be rooms like ours, and then ones that are 4x that price, so I was not expecting an upgrade to that.
* The rooms generally are very large though, I think the smallest rooms are like 700+ sq feet

**Late Checkout:** 4pm checkout offered without any question. We didn't need to take advantage.  
**Breakfast Credit:** This hotel offers complimentary breakfast buffet for all guests.  I'd characterize it as a notch above a continental breakfast buffet.  The FHR provides an additional $60 per day that can be used to order upgraded meals at breakfast (think like eggs benedict, avocado toast), or smoothies, juices, nicer coffees, etc.  The $60 credit can also be used for breakfast room service.

1k8skyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1k8skyk/honest_wonder_review_from_a_tired_parent_and/,Honest Wonder review from a tired parent and first-time DCL cruiser,"Came home yesterday from a 4-night cruise on the Wonder, from San Diego to Catalina, Ensenada, and back. Wanted to write down my very long-winded thoughts that nobody asked for in a place where it might be appreciated by one person! 

TLDR; 8/10 an overall fun experience with minor hiccups and lessons learned for the next one! Good balance of activities and relaxation, depending on what kind of vacation you want and the company you have with you. 

Context: 

Family of 3 - child is almost 5, and my husband and child had never cruised before and had no idea what to expect. I had been on one cruise about 10 years ago, a Princess cruise to Ensenada and back. We watched many YouTube videos about the Wonder, I lurked this subreddit for a couple of months, and felt like I had a good idea of how to navigate the app and maximize our time on board (within the constraints of having a 5-year old who loves routine, but also really loves all things Disney). We booked the cruise somewhat spontaneously - about 40 days out. 

Booking, PAT, and embarking on SD:

10/10

Fantastic and easy. PAT was 11:45, we arrived at about 11:30, moved through security and customs in literal minutes. We never got our luggage tags in the mail and it was no problem at all. Boarding group 9, and it moved very quickly. They have you take welcome photos and you’re on your way to boarding right after. Total time, maybe 45 minutes between being dropped off at port and stepping foot on the ship. We’re SD locals already so it was a breeze for us. 

First impressions and first hours onboard:

8/10

The ship is so charming and stunning! All the finishes are so nice. Really beautiful. Pluto greeted us from afar as they called our name in the main lobby. I connected to the ship’s WiFi and rushed to French Quarter lounge to request to change our dining time, even though we were already waitlisted. We had 2nd rotation and I knew we weren’t going to make it - just way too late for us as my kid is usually asleep by 8pm latest. We were put on another waitlist and kept our fingers crossed to be switched the earlier rotation, which never ended up happening. More on this later. After that, we made our way up to Cabanas for lunch and it was great! I’ve seen a lot of critique about the food, but we were honestly satisfied. We grabbed a table outside and enjoyed eating lunch while looking at the SD skyline. After that, son wanted to explore the kids pool area and slide and had a blast for about an hour before getting too cold. It was a little bit chaotic, though, as many people (like us) were noticeably getting their bearings and scrambling around. It’s a lot to take in all at once and was honestly borderline overstimulating the first and second day. 

Rotational dining:

3/10

We quickly realized we weren’t going to make it to our first restaurant, Tiana’s. It was just too late and we were already pretty tired from the chaos of the afternoon, getting settled in our room, getting our bearings and exploring the ship, etc. We ordered room service and told our Room Attendant that we weren’t going to make it to dinner and requested turn-down service a little early, which was no problem. We pushed through on the second and third nights for Triton’s/pirate night Triton’s, but to our ruin. We were physically WRECKED from such long days (and all 3 of us ended up sick by the last day). We usually eat dinner by 6 and just could not handle it. Even though second seating is 8:15, you aren’t starting to eat until close to 9, and out of there by 10-10:30. Who is eating dinner this late!?! Can’t relate. I felt so bad that my kid was going to bed over 3 hours past his normal bedtime and was completely loopy and overtired. I checked back in Guest Services the next day to see if there was anything I could do to get that 5:45 dining slot, but no luck. The food quality at Triton’s was fine. Nothing was bad, just wasn’t very good either. To us, it wasn’t worth suffering over. Back to quick service by the pool for dinner and it was honestly just fine with us. But I do think having that first seating would have greatly improved our experience. A big lesson learned - we booked this cruise a little over 30 days before sailing, and by that time all the first seatings were booked up. I also didn’t realize that another family would be at our table each night, but luckily, we ended up liking them and found it fun to run into them on other parts of the ship. I am disappointed we couldn’t experience Tiana’s or Animator’s Palate, and even if the restaurant food isn’t amazing, I think it would have been a game changer if we had dinner at our “normal” time and got to dine at all three of them.  

Stateroom:

7/10

We had a navigator’s veranda room on deck 6 (6138) and the view from the “hole” on the balcony FAR exceeded our expectations. It was huge! And had no obstructions. We were port side and got truly magnificent views of Catalina. Room was always perfectly clean, everything in working order, etc. Bed was comfortable and son was happy with his sofa bed. We were located very aft. Which was okay, as there was very little motion and therefore zero sea sickness for any of us. BUT. Holy crap it was CREAKY CREAKY CREAKY. Almost comically creaky and did disturb my sleep quite a bit. I don’t know if it was the ship itself being older, or the location of our room, or both. But wow, creak city. Would pick a different room next time solely because of the creaking. Otherwise, great room. 

Kids club, amenities, lounges, etc:

All excellent, 10/10, no notes. 

We didn’t come close to experiencing everything because of lack of parental bandwidth and son not being willing to do bingo or trivia, but he did very much enjoy the Oceaneer’s club/lab (more so when we joined him for open house hours). We also loved being able to watch movies in the theater during family movie time, which is when the lights remain on and it’s just way less pressure on the little ones. Pools are pretty small but it bothered nobody, and there were plenty of times when they weren’t fully occupied. During port days, they were almost empty, which was great. Cove cafe coffee place is great, Senses spa is great, gym is great…yeah. These cruises cost a fortune, but when you’re on the ship, you can see why. Theming is amazing everywhere. Finishes are beautiful. 

Scheduled activities, app, and WiFi:

6/10

My review will be skewed because we didn’t experience as much as we wanted. Was there a ton to do? Oh yes. Nobody could ever be bored on this ship, even though it’s the smallest of DCL. Bingo, trivia, crafts, dance parties, karaoke, games, lounges, etc. We wanted to do some character meet and greets, but the lines were always crazy long. Mickey’s sail away party was too chaotic and crowded by the time we got there, so we went outside to deck 4 and watched the ship sail away from the harbor quietly instead, which ended up being wonderful because you can walk around the entire ship. Pirate night theming was super fun and people were so into it and dressed up! But, the pirate party is at 10:15, which was too late for all of us to experience it (we are early to bed, early to rise folk). The app was helpful in sorting through what there is to do each day, as well as information about the ship and procedures. Glitchy at times. WiFi (free) was fine but could be better.

Shopping:

2/10

There’s two main shops, and they are so dang small. I would have loved to see a larger selection of clothes, snacks, toys, etc. For a family-oriented ship, I found the lack of toys in the shops to be odd, but maybe that’s just me. We are a Lego family and think selling Legos in the shops would be amazing for days at sea. But maybe that’s what all the dozens of daily activities are for. 

Buffet, quick service, room service, etc:

7/10

Not too bad! The best? No. Gourmet? Not at all. But satisfying and food for everyone to be happy. Tons of options at any time of day. And even if you can’t make it to 2nd seating dinner like us, you won’t go hungry. Tons of quick service food by the pools, and all pretty good. I’d say the worst food was room service - really limited and blah. Breakfast buffet was okay - churro waffles were a highlight. Lunch buffet was great every day and by far my favorite food experience on the ship. I realize this might be a hot take. Also, we all absolute LOVED getting fries and ice cream cones whenever we wanted and watching movies on the Funnel Vision. 

Port stuff:

8/10

We didn’t book any port adventures and wanted to play things by ear, depending on how we felt. Catalina was amazing. The experience of taking the ferry to the island was in itself a fun experience. We rented our own golf cart for an hour and drove around the entire island, which was the highlight of the entire cruise. The town is cute with lots of shops, restaurants, and things to do for all ages. We saw a ton of fish off the pier and even got to feed them with fish feed that someone gave us for free. Ensenada we couldn’t give a fair chance because we were so exhausted from the late dinners the two previous nights. It had taken a toll on our bodies and minds. Grumpy and tired. We got off the ship, ate churros and tacos (all of which were absolutely delicious), and got right back on the boat. The ease of getting off and back on the ship were extremely smooth and quick for both places. 

Service/hospitality/cleanliness:

10/10 wow. 

EVERYONE is so freaking nice and willing to help. You are greeted everywhere, staff go above and beyond to be polite and make things magical when they can. All of our assigned staff knew our names immediately and said hello to us by name any time we saw them. We had a basket of treats waiting for us in our room on the 2nd night, full of popcorn and 3 chocolate covered rice crispy treats with a sweet note, essentially saying sorry for not being able to accommodate the dining time. The ship is CLEAN. Any messes passengers make are quickly dealt with. Staff eyes are everywhere (in a good way). I loved that you have to wash your hands right outside of Cabanas before going in. Our room attendant went out of his way to mold to our wonky evening schedule for turn-down service (we ended up tipping him extra). 

Disembarking:

10/10

Easy peasy. We did express walk off as we only had one big suitcase and two backpacks. We got up, packed, ate breakfast at Cabanas, got back to the room to get our stuff, and left. Hardest part was waiting for an elevator, which wasn’t even that bad. Moving through customs was laughably easy. They only checked my husband’s passport and none of our baggage. 

After we got home, we crashed HARD. Our bodies gave up and we all have varying degrees of a cold/flu. We were as careful about washing hands and sanitizing as we could be, but realize it was inevitable. But was it magical? Yeah. Would we do it again? For sure.

### Unlocking the Power of Mushroom-Infused Drinks for Mental Clarity

Mushroom-infused drinks have become a wellness trend that many people turn to when seeking natural ways to boost focus and energy. These beverages blend the ancient wisdom of medicinal mushrooms with modern nutrition, providing you with an easy and enjoyable way to enhance your daily performance. Unlike traditional stimulants like coffee, mushroom-infused drinks offer a smoother energy lift without the dreaded crash, thanks to their natural compounds.

Different types of mushrooms bring unique benefits that promote brain health, mental clarity, and sustained energy. They often contain bioactive compounds such as beta-glucans, polysaccharides, and antioxidants, which not only support focus but also enhance your immune system. If you're looking for a natural way to stay sharp throughout the day, trying mushroom-infused drinks is a great start.

### Top 5 Options to Consider for Enhanced Focus and Energy

#### 1. Lion’s Mane Mushroom Latte

Lion’s Mane is famous for its cognitive-boosting properties. It stimulates nerve growth factor production, which can help improve memory and mental clarity. A Lion’s Mane mushroom latte combines the earthy flavor of this mushroom with creamy milk or plant-based alternatives, creating a comforting beverage that supports brain function. It’s a smart choice for those long workdays or creative sessions when you need to stay attentive.

#### 2. Cordyceps Energy Elixir

Cordyceps mushrooms are prized for their ability to increase stamina and reduce fatigue. They work by improving oxygen utilization and blood flow, providing a natural energy boost. Drinking a Cordyceps-infused elixir can help you power through your workouts or afternoon slumps without reaching for sugary energy drinks. Blended with herbs like ginseng and refreshing ingredients like lemon or ginger, this drink awakens your senses and sharpens focus.

#### 3. Reishi Mushroom Tea

Known as the “mushroom of immortality,” Reishi offers stress-relieving and immune-boosting effects that indirectly support mental performance. While Reishi is more calming than energizing, balancing stress can lead to improved concentration and steady energy. Brewing Reishi as a tea, possibly mixed with a touch of honey or cinnamon, provides a soothing experience that clears mental fog.

#### 4. Chaga Mushroom Smoothie

Chaga mushrooms grow on birch trees and contain potent antioxidants that fight oxidative stress. Drinking Chaga in a smoothie form allows you to combine nutrient-rich fruits and veggies with this powerful mushroom. This combination fuels your brain cells and keeps energy levels steady. The subtle earthy taste of Chaga blends well with ingredients like berries and spinach, making it a delicious and healthful pick-me-up.

#### 5. Mushroom Matcha Blend

Combining matcha green tea and medicinal mushrooms creates a potent drink for both alertness and cognitive support. Matcha provides caffeine for a gentle energy lift, while mushrooms such as Lion’s Mane or Cordyceps add long-lasting mental clarity. This fusion is ideal for anyone who enjoys tea but wants an extra edge in staying focused. It’s simple to prepare by mixing mushroom powder into your daily matcha ritual.

### Why Choose Mushroom-Infused Drinks Over Regular Stimulants?

If you often rely on coffee or energy drinks, switching to mushroom-infused options can bring multiple advantages. These drinks tend to reduce jitters and avoid the energy crash associated with caffeine overload. The natural compounds in mushrooms help regulate your nervous system and support sustained brain health over time.

​ -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ​  
  
Additionally, many mushroom-infused drinks contain adaptogens—substances that help your body handle stress more effectively. Managing stress is crucial because it affects your ability to concentrate and maintain energy throughout the day. This holistic approach makes mushroom drinks not just a quick fix but a part of a healthy routine for mental excellence.

### How to Incorporate These Drinks into Your Daily Life

Starting your day with a mushroom latte, or enjoying a Cordyceps elixir mid-morning, can replace less beneficial caffeine habits. Many people find that integrating these drinks gradually allows their body to adapt and benefit fully. You can purchase mushroom powders, extracts, or ready-made beverages online or in health stores.

Look for products that use high-quality, organic mushrooms and avoid unnecessary additives or fillers. When making your own drinks, remember to brew or blend the mushrooms properly since this helps unlock their active ingredients. Experimenting with flavors and combining mushrooms with ingredients you enjoy can turn this healthful practice into a delightful daily ritual.

### Final Thoughts on Elevating Your Focus Naturally

If you're searching for a natural way to boost your focus and energy levels, mushroom-infused drinks offer a unique solution grounded in traditional medicine and modern science. By exploring options like Lion’s Mane lattes or Cordyceps energy elixirs, you tap into a powerful source of mental clarity and sustained vitality.

Die ikonischen Ivatan-Steinhäuser stehen als dauerhafte Symbole der Widerstandsfähigkeit gegen die Elemente.

Batanes ist mehr als nur malerisch; es verkörpert Absicht. Es ist ein Ort, an dem weniger mehr ist, wo der Tourismus Respekt und die Bewahrung der Kultur über Massenandrang stellt. Die Natur wird hier nicht nur beobachtet; sie wird tief empfunden. Der Wind trägt Erzählungen, Stille birgt Bedeutung, und die Zeit scheint ihr unerbittliches Tempo zu verlangsamen. Dies ist nicht nur ein Besuch; es ist ein Eintauchen für dich, wenn du mit Sorgfalt kommst.

Stell dir die smaragdgrünen Wellen des Marlboro Country (Racuh a Payaman) vor, wo der Wind über sanfte Hügel tanzt, während Kühe friedlich grasen – eine Szene wie aus einem Traum. Steig zum Basco Lighthouse hinauf für atemberaubende 360-Grad-Ausblicke auf grüne Landschaften und den weiten Ozean, ein Ort für deine stille Besinnung.

Finde Ruhe am Chawa View Deck und blicke auf den endlosen Pazifik, während du spürst, wie der Wind alte Geschichten trägt.

Sei beeindruckt vom mystischen Berg Iraya, einem schlafenden Vulkan, der in Nebel gehüllt ist und dessen Pfade dir eine Verbindung zur Natur und deinem eigenen Inneren bieten.

So my boyfriend and best friend don't like each other and in my boyfriend's defense, she's A LOT to handle. She's moving out of state in a few months and my other friend just moved out of state too. In  the meantime, I've been on Bumble For Friends trying to make connections and build friendships so when my best friend of over 6 years moves, I have SOMEONE. 

My boyfriend seems to have an issue with me trying to make friends. Making comments like ""You're talking to strangers!"" even though I pointed out to him that literally every single person is a stranger until you talk and get to know them. 

He flip flops though. Sometimes he'll be okay with it and then 5 minutes later he'll start fighting with me about it. 

I'm on disability so I don't work and I only get to see my boyfriend on weekends so I don't understand what the problem is. It's not like me making new friends is taking time away from him. He's at work. 

The other night I got excited because I connected with someone on the app who lives in my town and we were talking about making plans to meet up on Thursday when I get paid and go grab a slice of pizza at the place across the street from my house. 

My boyfriend lost his mind because I said usually the first time I'll meet someone at Dunkin for coffee and talk to see if we click or some other public place. When I told him about the plans, he called me and immediately started going off on me about how I'm having dinner with her and that's a ""big escalation from just getting coffee.' 

I was like...um...no...I said coffee or another public place. And we're getting a slice of pizza. It's not like we're sitting down at a fancy restaurant. 

He's always complaining that I never share anything with him but this is exactly why I never want to talk to him about my day. Talking about grabbing pizza with this woman turned into a 7 hour argument. 

Am I wrong hers? Like, I understand he's concerned about me but I'm like a block away from my house and meeting her in a public place. I just don't understand why he doesn't want me to make friends.",1,1745717461.0,relationshipproblems,1,1.0,False

He told me from the start that he wants to take things slow and get to know me properly before committing. We haven’t had sex yet, it took him 3 weeks to kiss me, and he’s generally been respectful and kind. He sees me pretty regularly—almost every other day—but our time together is usually limited to casual hangouts like coffee dates or chilling at each other’s places. He hasn’t taken me on any proper dates, which feels off.

I confronted him about it, and he said he doesn’t really do formal dates and he’s more casual until things get a bit more serious, and that this is just how he operates in the early stages. He’s also on a strict meal plan for a diet, so he says that’s part of the reason we don’t go out for dinner or anything more “official.”

His texting pattern is also inconsistent. Sometimes he’s super present and messages me a lot throughout the day, and other times he’s clearly focused on his friends or busy and barely checks in. It leaves me feeling a bit uncertain. I’ve asked him directly if he’s seeing other people, and he told me he isn’t. He says he genuinely likes me and wants to see where this goes.

Some of my friends think he might not be over his ex or that he’s just not that into me and is stringing me along. But my gut tells me he’s not a bad guy—just a little emotionally unavailable or guarded. Still, I can’t help but feel like I’m accepting breadcrumbs and making excuses for the lack of effort.

So I guess I’m wondering:
Is this just how some guys approach dating seriously—slow and casual at first—or is this a red flag that he’s not emotionally available or not really invested?

Would love any insight from guys who’ve been in similar situations or know what this kind of behavior might actually mean.",1,1745717372.0,AskMenAdvice,24,0.57,False

It’s been six months since I had to leave my home due to black mold, and things have been a rollercoaster. I've been struggling with several health issues, and after a lot of trial and error (and two nose surgeries), I’ve learned that I’ve developed histamine intolerance. Whether this is genetic or triggered by mold exposure, I’m not entirely sure, but it’s been quite the journey. I wanted to update you all on what I’ve learned and how I’m adjusting.

# Histamine Intolerance & Symptoms

As I continue navigating this, I’ve realized my body really struggles with histamine. The symptoms — swollen turbinates in my nose, acid reflux, post-nasal drip, and anxiety — are all signs of histamine intolerance. I’m still figuring out how best to manage this, but I’ve made some changes that seem to be helping.

# Diet Adjustments & Managing Histamine

One of the biggest changes has been my diet. I’ve had to be very strict about what I’m eating. I started by focusing on meat from the butcher and eating avocado before meals to maintain B6 production. However, I cut out avocado recently after receiving advice from a few people in the histamine intolerance community. It seems to have helped.

Instead, I’m incorporating **red peppers** into my meals as a source of **vitamin C** and to support gut motility, which has been crucial for me. I also ordered some new supplements to help my body manage histamine better: a **DAO supplement** (to support histamine breakdown), **100% pure Glutamine** (for gut healing), and **100% Bio Bone Broth** (for collagen support). I’ve also committed to eating **only fresh meat**, as that seems to be the safest option right now.

# Managing Constipation

One of the biggest struggles I've had is with constipation. If I don’t manage it, it worsens my histamine intolerance symptoms — more nasal swelling and acid reflux. The good news is that I’ve found **coffee** helps with this. After a bowel movement, I notice that my nasal swelling decreases, so it seems a lot of my symptoms are tied to digestion.

To keep things moving, I’ve also started drinking **water with sparkling bubbles** to support my digestion, and I add **salt** to help maintain electrolytes, especially since I’m following a **low-carb** diet. So far, it seems to be working better than expected.

# Fasting & Future Plans

I’ve considered trying a water fast, but after careful thought, I decided against it for now. Given my digestive issues, I likely have some vitamin deficiencies, and fasting could worsen that. I’m sticking with my anti-histamine diet and seeing how my body responds before diving into other options like long-term fasting.

# Looking Ahead

I'm planning to continue with my current approach — focusing on fresh meat, bone broth, red peppers for vitamin C, and supporting my gut with the supplements I mentioned. It’s still a work in progress, but I’m feeling cautiously optimistic. If you’ve had experiences with histamine intolerance, black mold exposure, or long-term fasting with any of these issues, I’d love to hear your advice or stories.

Thanks for all your support, and I appreciate any insights you may have!

i took about a 2 month break and surprisingly got a job at an even better coffee shop. however, i only worked a 2 hour trial shift and i'm already dreading workign here. the first problem is that it's very far away. about a 30 minute drive, if not more during traffic. i thought it'd be okay because it's about 5-10 minutes from my college, but i didn't realize how far it can feel. 

however, this job pays minimum wage plus a good number of tips, totaling 24$ an hour which is very high in my area (california). i thought it's worth the drive but i'm honestly dreading it, even though i'm only doing 3 days a week. should i just push it out or is it understandable to quit? 

i also want to add that although the owners in my interview did not mention this, they are part of a very religious church that has had some instances of homophobia and money laundrying. there is no evidence they directly are homophobic or anything, but they do host church events at the cafe. 

however, if i quit i will have a hard time finding a job. ideally i'd want a job that's in my town and not 30 minutes away, even if it's close to my college (which the semester will be ending in like 1-2 months). i'm about to go off to a different college and want to keep working so that when i attend the college i do not have to worry about working during that first semester (heavy transition).

We went 3 hours early, thought we were going to miss our cruise. Virgin voyages gets a 10/10 from us.  We went super cheap with an inside cabin. Room was bigger than we thought. Shower amazing. Bed super comfortable. Air flow in cabin (the whole ship really) was awesome. No dead, stale air. We were in and out of the room 6 times a day, so much to do.  I used the tablet for fresh water and towels 4 times a day.  30 minutes later water and towels would be changed.  

Service from the crew was like Chick-fil-A from 1000 people. They had an army of people cleaning everything. They were never rude, or rolled their eyes. They looked for ways to do something for you. Restaurants serve the prettiest food ever. EVERY dish is picture perfect like a magazine cover.  Taste 90% was the best things we ever ate. Chicken enchiladas at pink Agave were little dry. Hamburgers and steaks did fit impress me, but we butcher our own cow every year so we’re spoiled with beef.  The sauces on the steaks made them amazing.  

Entertainment was small, intimate, sensual, not sexual. Top notch music and singing. They had a group “magnets” doing shows. Go watch them. Beyond talented, look them up and go see them live where ever you can. They are that good. 

Line dancing class was so fun. The instructor girl was very good at what she does. Latin dance class same way. The instructor guy was super nice. They had me and wife dancing for real, and we are not dance people. 

Complaints.  The 2 guys doing the kettle bell room and bungee class were rude. Only interested in private class stuff.  My wife is 105 pounds. In The bungee class she couldn’t get into the bungee without me stopping and getting her into it.  She could barely move the bungee at all. I had to reach over and push her a lot.  Sone other poor little lady on the other side just gave up and stood there. The guy running the class didn’t give a crap.  I went to the kettle bell room early most days. Those same two guys would get in my face saying they cleaned that room for a class so I need to leave. I ask when is the class? 30 minutes. I just looked at them and said “too bad” and kept working out. In what would does a trainer get gym priority more than 10 minutes before a class? They tried to get pissy with me. I could tell they were not regular Virgin Voyages . I went and got me a cup of coffee and walked back around the room to see their class. Nobody was there.

1k8selg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1k8selg/why_triumph_gold_tig_might_be_undervalued/,Why Triumph Gold ($TIG) Might Be Undervalued 💰,"**Triumph Gold** Corp. (**$TIG** | TSX-V: TIG | OTC: TIGCF) is a Canadian junior exploration company focused on its 100% owned Freegold Mountain Project in Yukon’s prolific Dawson Range copper-gold belt. Despite its promising assets and strategic positioning, $TIG may be undervalued for several reasons:

1. Market Overlooking Junior Explorers: Junior mining stocks like $TIG often fly under the radar of mainstream investors, especially in a market dominated by tech and crypto hype. This lack of attention can depress share prices relative to the company’s asset potential.
2. High-Quality Asset in a Tier-1 Jurisdiction: The Freegold Mountain Project spans a 34-kilometer mineralized trend with three significant deposits (Nucleus Au-Ag-Cu, Revenue Cu-Au-Mo-Ag-W, and Tinta Hill polymetallic vein) and multiple prospects. Located in Yukon, a mining-friendly region with established infrastructure, the project benefits from low geopolitical risk and road accessibility, yet its market valuation may not fully reflect this.
3. Recent Exploration Success: Triumph has reported compelling drill results, such as 46.28 meters of 0.54 g/t Au and 0.53 g/t Ag, including 4.50 meters of 2.00 g/t Au, and 106.50 meters of 0.76 g/t AuEq. These results suggest significant resource expansion potential, but the market may not have priced in these catalysts.
4. Commodity Supercycle Tailwinds: Gold, silver, copper, and molybdenum—$TIG’s target metals—are in high demand due to inflation hedging, green energy transitions, and industrial growth. Copper, in particular, is critical for renewables, and Yukon’s Dawson Range hosts world-class deposits like Casino and Coffee. $TIG’s exposure to these metals positions it for upside as commodity prices rise, yet its current market cap may not reflect this macro trend.
5. Experienced Leadership: With a management team boasting decades of exploration and capital markets experience (e.g., John Anderson, who raised $35M for $TIG, and Brian Bower, instrumental in developing major deposits), the company has the expertise to unlock value. The market may undervalue this proven track record.
6. Volatile Share Price: $TIG’s share price has been volatile, with a 17% weekly volatility rate, potentially scaring off risk-averse investors. However, this volatility can create buying opportunities for those who see the long-term potential in its assets and exploration results.
7. Underexplored Potential: The Tad Toro and Big Creek properties, part of $TIG’s portfolio, show underexplored gold-silver epithermal zones along the Big Creek Fault System. These early-stage assets could add significant value as exploration progresses, but they may not yet be factored into the stock’s valuation.

In summary, $TIG’s combination of a high-potential project, recent exploration success, strategic commodity exposure, and seasoned leadership suggests it may be undervalued relative to its peers and the broader commodity market outlook. For risk-tolerant investors, particularly millennials seeking exposure to the mining sector’s growth potential, $TIG presents a compelling opportunity.

My husband and I have been married since I was 18 I'm now 32, he's 35. We have 2 kids under 10. Neither of us are big on daycare and I wouldn't make enough for it to worth it..so I've been a stay at home mum for the last decade. My husband has made work connections and friends whilst I have zero. He'll stay late to drink and hang with the guys most nights (not for long 30 min to a  max 2-3 hrs). He works biweekly 4 hrs away. We've always had a fun loving, bff style marriage but there's always been a silver lining of negativity. He's a workaholic. Not just in his career, but when he's home, I wake up to an empty bed and he's gone running errands or finding things he ""needs"" to do. I wish he'd just breathe a bit and stop hunting for more things to fill up his time. As it is he and I spend barely any time together and of course our kids get the shit end of that stick too because dad is always busy. I don't deny he goes above and beyond for us but there's so much that he doesn't need to commit to that he chooses to, just to keep his schedule full. It's at a point where it feels he's doing this to avoid me , and our life. And maybe that's selfish of me to assume, idk. He has no mental issues, meanwhile I have bipolar and bad depression that bleeds into our life often enough. Problem is, I don't know if it's my mental health or just my lack of marital fulfillment that makes me feel so denied. He wants sex often enough, and does little things like making my coffee each day he's home, but it's gotten to feel routine and disgruntled, i still wake up alone. Like he does it because he always has so why stop now it'll just bring up questions. He just doesn't show me true passion anymore..am I being immature or am I lacking fulfillment in my marriage?

1k8sc2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1k8sc2v/what_languages_are_fairly_in_demand_but_are/,What languages are fairly in demand but are pretty neglected or difficult to find resources for?,"Hi all! 

So this is a request for opinions / help but also something I think could be an interesting topic of discussion. I hope you agree!

I enjoy both learning languages and creating websites as hobbies, so I've been putting together a free database of language learning resources, primarily for people who are learning independently. 

It's still in its infancy and not really ready yet, so I'm not here trying to promote it, but I do want to briefly explain what I'm doing so you know why I'm asking.

Basically, I'm cataloging apps, tutorials, books, video playlists, websites, classes, tools, and podcasts, etc., for different languages. Eventually I will add articles on different language acquisition theories, learning tips, comprehensive / comparative reviews, and free resources that I've personally created. 

But for now, I'm building up a database of sorts so people don't have to spend hours scouring online looking for stuff in their TL. It's a labor of love and a very slow process. Lol 

Anyways, I want to focus initially on creating guides for languages that would be the most useful / in need to find resources for. (I eventually plan to add a lot more, but I mean just to start.) 

Having done a couple now, I can tell you that the resource pages are very time consuming to actually research and build, so I want to prioritize them by usefulness, and then maybe expand.

Also, there are probably smaller teachers and creators I'll be able to locate and highlight for these languages, vs only featuring popular apps or websites for languages like Spanish or Japanese (which I'm also working on, but those guides are behemoths) that arguably have an oversaturation of resources now.

So I'm wondering about people's opinions on this. Whether you're learning it / them yourself or not, are there any languages you feel are being neglected by the language teaching world in general or just are hard to find resources for but really shouldn't be? 

For me, that language is Farsi (Persian), so I have that resource page started, as well as one for Toki Pona. But I know there are *so* many languages out there that also deserve better but might not be on my personal radar. 

E.g., I remember learners of Finnish actively campaigned to Duolingo for a solid couple of years before they finally added it. But now the course is kind of languishing, as I understand it. Is it still hard to find things for it?

Some languages are just severely neglected overall and unfortunately will likely continue to be (I think especially ones from Africa and southern Asia, as well as indigenous languages in general). I'm especially happy to feature those and any endangered languages, if people want them. 

I need probably 3 - 5 more languages to start with, so I'm hoping for some ideas.

I'm open to everything (including conlangs) but am focusing on learning from English for now due to my own personal limitations, unless I eventually get help with the site. Right now, it's just me.

If there are any languages that you personally can't find things for, feel free to ask! I might be able to help, at least for a few initial options, like apps.

Also, feel free to share resources you think would be useful for me to include or that you personally recommend, etc. These would be super valuable. (Tag me?) Suggestions, too!

FWIW, I intend to keep the database totally free and free of intrusive ads. But I'll have some affiliate links with a couple of relevant companies (e.g., Amazon for books) to hopefully help pay for hosting and coffee.",8,1745716759.0,languagelearning,9,1.0,False

i just have the instinct to think that he'd have a huge sweet tooth? maybe something naturally sweet, definitely warm, a bit floral and calming. it certainly wouldn't be a tea on the cheap side though LOL. something he would think is more *first-class* and refined, like an expensive imported tea...
