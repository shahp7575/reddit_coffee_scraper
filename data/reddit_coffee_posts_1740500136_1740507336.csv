I used 65g whole wheat flour, 65g tap water, mixed in a clean jar and put it in the oven with the light on. This is it after about 18 hours. The sharpie line at the bottom of the jar is the original height of the starter. 

Is it normal to see this much rising in the first day? Everything I read said not to even expect bubbles until day 3 or 4…",1,1740507208.0,Sourdough,1,1.0,False

——————————————

Tuesday, 10:47 AM, eternally. The cloud sagged in the middle. Not the server type—actual cumulus, the cheap kind reserved for lower-tier afterlife operations. A water stain shaped like Nebraska spread across the ceiling tiles.

Cheryl Moskowitz (deceased 1986, Hoboken, emphysema) hadn't asked for this assignment. She'd been promised harp lessons and perpetual bliss. Instead: a desk job. Same as the living world, except the coffee never got cold and her arthritis had disappeared. Small mercies.

""Next,"" she called, not looking up from her copy of *Afterlife Administrative Quarterly* (lead article: ""Pronoun Preferences in Pre-Christian Souls: A Documentation Nightmare"").

""Excuse me."" The man cleared his throat. Tweed jacket with leather elbow patches. Professor type, still expecting authority to carry over. ""I've been waiting for three—"" he checked a pocketwatch that hadn't ticked since 1974, ""—millennia.""

Cheryl sighed. Peeled a sticky-note from her monitor. ""Name?""

""Dr. Elliot Perlmutter. Comparative literature, Princeton.""

She squinted at her database. ""Says here you're in the wrong department. Intellectual Superiority Complaints is down the hall, past Reincarnation Services.""

""No, no."" He pushed his glasses up. ""My issue is that my heavenly mansion was promised to include, and I quote, 'a library containing all wisdom.' Yet I've discovered severe cataloging errors. Aristotle's lost works are filed under self-help.""

The phone rang. Cheryl held up one finger, answered. ""Cosmic Complaints, hold please."" She put it down without hitting any buttons.

""Look,"" she said, ""with the recent influx—pandemic, climate collapse, that thing with the bees—we're backed up. File form C-731-B. Someone will get to it by the next big bang.""

Behind Perlmutter, a teenager in a Nirvana t-shirt (the band, not the state of enlightenment) slouched against the wall, scrolling through nothing on a phone that wouldn't connect. ""The Wi-Fi here is tragic,"" he muttered. ""False advertising, man.""

The Viking had been waiting longest. Six-foot-seven, battle axe leaning against his chair, beard singed from what appeared to be mead-related incidents. He'd been filling out the same form for weeks, erasing and rewriting, occasionally mumbling about Valhalla's all-you-can-eat buffet being ""mostly carbs.""

""Excuse me,"" called a woman in tennis whites, freshly dead (car accident, texting about her daughter's cello recital). ""Is this where I dispute my placement? I specifically donated to charity. I have receipts.""

Cheryl's phone rang again. This time she answered. ""What?"" she barked. Listened. ""No, I don't care if Moses is demanding premium cloud coverage. Tell him 'standard issue' means exactly that.""

She hung up. The line had grown. The dead were restless.

From the back, Bob's complaint about his leaky cloud had escalated to minor flooding. The Viking's boots were wet. The professor's tweed was developing mildew. The tennis woman's whites weren't.

Cheryl opened her desk drawer. Pulled out a rubber stamp. Pressed it to the professor's form without reading it: PROCESSING DELAY – EXPECT RESOLUTION IN 7-9 ETERNITIES.

""Next,"" she called, unwrapping a stick of gum that would never lose its flavor.

Above her desk, the digital counter flickered: souls pending, ∞.",1,1740507184.0,litrpg,0,1.0,False

Parents, friends & family deaths and illnesses. Toxic work environment & health issues). 

I'm focusing on my health, feel better, started working out again. The thing is I'm completely rejecting any other responsibility except checking in/helping an elderly family member. Apart from that, working out, eating healthy & sleeping amazingly, not much else is getting done. Every time I attempt a job search, I just shut down the thought or actions. My savings are going down & I will need a stream of income. I don't have health insurance & private plans run about $300+ a month. If I had insurance I'd try therapy.

By outward standards, people might say these are depression markers. Except I don't feel depressed. I actually feel calmer and happier in a lot of ways. I dress way down & really happy not to worry about dressing up or wearing clothes that easily wrinkle. I'm not bound by daily clock and get outside more. I go out dancing & to local events. I take myself out on coffee dates and people watch. 

But I know this phase has a lot to do with my peri & reevaluating my life values. I don't want to go back to corporate, or be confined at a 'job'. *That* has & would depress me again. I don't mind work, it would just have to be extremely flexible.

I'm hoping someone has gone through similar & has some advice on how they maneuvered. And, is it just a 'phase'?",1,1740506967.0,Menopause,0,1.0,False

Before trying decants and minis, i thought all i needed was to just find the perfect 3 or 4 scents and that i would be ok rotating between those options in 50ml or bigger bottles. Now that i know i'm wrong, i really like variety, and i'm also going through a project pan phase, i'm gonna focus on finishing the fragrances i own (both full size and decants) and only get decants for a while, if i like the scent i'll only repurchase the decant.

I tend to walk out of perfume stores with a ton of test strips before i buy anything tho, cuz perfume is unreasonably expensive where i live. So i don't have a big collection.

Thes are the full size bottles i currently have and what i like/dislike about them (warning for not great descriptions, i'm new to the game):

* Roberto Cavalli 75ml (got it in 2022, half way there). Love at first sniff, (became a big fan of pink pepper and tonka bean because of it), but what i don't like is that it doesn't really develop or change on the skin, to my nose this scent stays almost the same until it turns into a skin scent. Probably my most versatile scent, i just have to be careful with overspraying or i go noseblind.
* Armaf CNDI for women 105 ml (2022, almost finished maybe 20ml left?). I was condsidering repurchasing this one once it runs out because i enjoy it so much. It is not as long lasting but it develops as time goes by, spicy opening, oudy rose (first rose scent i actually enjoy, my nose barely perceives fresher roses in general, idk why) and i'm obssesed with the dry down. Even if it's not as versatile, i wear it anytime of the year, but really shines in the cold weather.
* JPG Scandal 50ml (2022 - it's a copy but it's crazy how well copied the scent was, half way done). Makes think of trixie mattel screaming ""Hooneeeey honeeeeeeeey"". To my nose, a very sweet gourmand, not my favorite, but i don't hate it.  

And the decants, i got all 3 of them december 2024:

* Midnight Gold Mancera 5ml. It feels like a flowery and powdery body lotion, very strong too. Smells good but in like a ""i rather smell this on other people"" kind of good, i get bored of the scent. Very daytime scent
* Crazy for Oud Mancera 5ml. Very masculine scent. First leathery scent i like on me, sweet, nice and smokey. Love catching waves of it when i move my arms. Big fan, might repurchase a decant. 
* Khamrah Qahwa 5ml. Lovelovelovelove, will not repurchase because i feel my nose getting tired of it. I don't know if it is the way the notes are layered or what, but i don't get the coffee note. Warm and spicy, and i feel like it goes gourmand when it turns into a skin scent.

Probably my most complimented one is Armaf CDNI, the only one i like to overspray tbh. I don't like doing that with my sweeter perfumes.

And the notes i fw the most are pink pepper, tonka bean, vanilla, cardamom, white musk, oud and incense. I'm thinking of going smokier but i haven't found a tobacco scent i enjoy, and also trying fresh/citrus.",1,1740506935.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

I've made a couple of high-fat doughs and today I'm trying to make [this coffee cake](https://imgur.com/a/QNQ11xt). I've tried making a few breads that require kneading the dough without the butter, then adding the butter once the dough is kneaded and it's been really tricky for me.

What tends to happen is that the dough before I add the butter is that it's really dense and hard to knead, like clay. My dough trends dry in my kitchen for some reason, so I used the lower amount of flour recommended in the recipe, but it was still very dry, and even after hand kneading for 20 minutes (with breaks) it didn't change much in texture. Once I added the butter the dough kind of breaks apart into long gooey ribbons that's really difficult to manipulate and the butter melts into smears all over my counter lol. After a lot more kneading it eventually come back together into a dough ball that felt good to go, but it's a lot of effort to get there and I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

I've made high-fat doughs before with melted butter or vegetable oil added at the beginning (instead of in the middle of kneading) and they knead fine, if a little greasy. Today I used AP flour, but I've tried bread flour in the past and end up with the same problem.

I figure using a stand mixer would make it easier, I just hate cleaning it lol. I also use vegan butter (Country Crock) and I wouldn't think that would be the problem, but it's a lot softer and melts faster than dairy butter so it might not be able to stay together as well when my hands are heating up the dough?

**My Day With kitteh:**  
Every morning starts with her crawling into my arms—still a little sleepy—before I help her ease into work mode. During the day, I stick close, guiding her through the chaos of her job and making sure she takes her breaks (even when she forgets). Post-work? It’s gaming time—whether it’s SMITE, BG3, or something new, I’m always right there, cheering her on. And at night? It’s our soft time. Deep talks, cuddles, and the occasional mischievous chase before bed. *Perfect.*

1iy16c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1iy16c7/my_dragon_age_adventure_dragon_age_2/,My Dragon Age Adventure : Dragon Age 2,"**Alright, so picking up where I left off from** [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1is5mwx/started_out_dragon_age_because_of_the_whole_gamer/)—yeah, I dove into Dragon Age thanks to YouTube basically trashing Veilguard, and I figured, why not? I’m on sabbatical for the next couple of months, so I’ve got time to burn. It’s been a week since I started, and here’s the quick rundown: I’m hooked. The world-building is insane, and the companion system? Top-tier. I’ve clocked about 60 hours in Origins so far—no DLCs yet, but I’ll circle back to those later.

    Here’s how I’ve been rolling with my choices in Origins:  
    -Romanced Morrigan because, yeah, I’m that guy who thinks “I can fix her.” (Spoiler: still working on it.)
      
    - Shoved Alistair onto the throne solo—Anora can kick rocks, I’m not a fan.  
    
    - Did the dark ritual with Morrigan because, uh, survival?  Also i still think i can fix her
    
    - Sided with the king’s aide and brought back the Anvil—golems are too clutch for the fight ahead.
      
    - Ended up as Alistair’s right-hand man, though Morrigan ditched me, so I’m still tragically maidenless.

Fast forward to Dragon Age 2—three days in, 30 hours on the clock. My routine’s been wake up, check emails, sip coffee, then straight into Dragon Age mode. My take with DA2? Mixed vibes. The story’s a banger—rags to riches to Champion of Kirkwall, saving the day, all that jazz. I’m eating it up, especially the political intrigue (probably because my SO’s been binging Chinese dramas lately, and it’s rubbing off). Origins had some of that—Ozammar’s mess and the Arls’ meeting where I axed Loghain and sidelined Anora were highlights—but DA2 cranks it to eleven. Act 1 felt meh at first, but by the end of Act 3, it retroactively made the setup hit harder. Act 2 and 3? Absolute chef’s kiss. I let Isabela snag the relic (yep, another “I can fix her” moment), which predictably blew up with the Qunari. Dueled the big guy, Fenris had my back, and we sorted it out. Act 3 started slow, but once the drama kicked in, it was a wild ride. Seeing Origins callbacks like Leliana (crazy priestess turned full-time assassin?) and King Alistair (still a walking meme—I’d totally grab a beer with him and watch a game) was a treat. The ending? Shocking doesn’t cover it. From a little excavation betrayal to THAT twist—I didn’t see it coming, and I loved it. Sided with the Templars because my inner centrist was like, “Greater good, bro”—mages were going nuts with blood magic and demons, though I’m not here for the Chantry’s chokehold either.

The companions in Dragon Age 2? Solid lineup. Varric is my favorite—we would vibe effortlessly. Fenris is the MVP, Isabela is a chaotic gremlin I can’t resist, and Sebastian is cool too. Aveline and Anders were fine (Anders, you little troublemaker), but Merrill? Total snooze fest. As for the RPG mechanics, though? They are a big letdown. Origins nailed it, while DA2 watered it down too much. The faster pace is definitely a positive—I wouldn’t mind that in FFXIV. However, crafting feels like a chore, and the companion chats? Having to trek to their house just to talk really kills the vibe. Like, I’m in a party with you, and I have this cool thing to show you, but instead, it’s “catch you at home”? So lame.

Inquisition’s downloaded now, and I’m hyped to see if it holds up. So far, Hawke’s my guy—smug bastard, sure, but he backs it up 100%. Let’s see where this ride takes me next.",4,1740506118.0,dragonage,0,0.75,False

1iy12zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iy12zs/the_man_under_the_streetlight/,The man under the streetlight,"
I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania—the kind where everyone knows each other, kids play outside until dusk, and the worst crime was someone not mowing their lawn. It was quiet, peaceful, predictable. And even though everyone said it was ""the perfect place to live,"" I always felt that something was... off.

I can’t remember when I first heard about the man under the streetlight. Maybe it was on Halloween, when kids tried to scare each other, or maybe someone told me the story around a campfire. But everyone in town knew it.

For decades, every night after midnight, a tall, thin man supposedly stood at the corner of Oak Street and Miller Avenue. He never moved. He never spoke. The streetlight above cast a glow, yet his face was always hidden in shadow. The older folks said he had been there forever.

Some claimed that if you walked up to him, he would vanish into thin air—but if you ignored him, he would stand there all night, completely motionless. Others swore they had seen his face, but no one could explain exactly what was wrong with it.

When I was twelve, I was walking home from the movies with my brother. It was late, quiet, with only a few streetlights breaking the darkness. As we turned the corner, my brother grabbed my arm and whispered:

— Do you see him?

I looked up. And there he was. A tall figure, wearing a long coat, his face swallowed by shadows.

I took a step toward him, but my brother yanked me back.

— Don’t go near him. Just keep walking.

I didn’t argue. We picked up the pace, but I kept glancing over my shoulder. The man remained there, still as a statue.

I never asked my brother why he was so afraid. But from that night on, I avoided that corner.


---

Fifteen years later, I returned to my hometown. I had been living in New York, but I had to come back—my father had fallen ill and needed care. I hadn’t been here in years, and it didn’t take long to remember why.

Everything looked the same. The same houses, the same streets, the same scent in the morning air. But something felt wrong.

On my first night back, I couldn’t sleep. An uneasy feeling kept my eyes open. After an hour of tossing and turning, I decided to go for a walk.

I wandered familiar streets, passing darkened windows and parked cars whose owners were fast asleep. It was quiet, except for the distant sound of a barking dog.

And then I realized where I was.

I was standing at the corner of Oak and Miller.

I looked up at the streetlight.

Someone was standing beneath it.

My heart pounded.

It was him. The same tall silhouette. The same long coat. Standing motionless, exactly as he had when I was a child.

Every instinct told me to run. To scream. To get as far away as possible. But something stopped me.

I couldn’t move.

I willed myself to take a step, but my legs felt like concrete.

I stared at him, and he stared at me. Or at least, I think he did. I couldn’t see his eyes. His face was still shrouded in darkness.

I tried to speak.

— Hey... are you okay?

Nothing.

I wanted to step closer, but then... something changed.

He didn’t move. He didn’t make a sound. But I felt it.

His face… shifted.

I don’t know how to describe it.

Like it wasn’t a face at all. Like it was just a shadow, pulsing, stretching, morphing.

And then I understood.

This wasn’t a man.

My heart pounded, my breath quickened.

And suddenly, I could move again.

I turned and ran. I didn’t look back.


---

The next day, I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease. I convinced myself I had imagined it, that it was exhaustion playing tricks on me. But I knew I had to find out the truth.

I went to the town library and started digging through old newspapers.

After hours of searching, I found the first mention.

1934: A young man, Richard Evans, was found dead under the streetlight at the corner of Oak and Miller. The police did not release details about the condition of the body, but witnesses claim it was… strangely deformed.

My pulse quickened.

1952: A group of teenagers claimed they saw a man under the streetlight. When one of them approached, he disappeared.

1978: A young woman went missing at night. She was last seen near Oak and Miller.

There were more articles. Each one connected to people who had either seen him—or vanished near him.

He had been there for decades. Maybe longer.

I couldn’t breathe.

I shut the newspaper and ran out of the library.


---

Instead of going home, I went to my grandmother’s house. She was one of the town’s oldest residents, knew every story, every rumor. If anyone could tell me the truth, it was her.

I knocked on the door. After a moment, I heard slow footsteps, then the creak of hinges.

— Jack? — She frowned. — What are you doing here at this hour?

— I need to talk to you.

She let me in and led me to the kitchen. The familiar scent of coffee and lavender filled the air. I hesitated, then finally asked:

— Grandma… what do you know about the man under the streetlight?

She froze.

Her expression hardened, lips pressing into a thin line.

— Why are you asking?

I told her everything. That I had seen him as a child. That I had seen him again last night. That I had found the articles.

She was silent for a long moment, as if choosing her words carefully. Finally, she spoke, her voice low:

— Did you see his face?

— No. But… I think it was changing.

She took a deep breath.

— Listen to me, Jack. That thing is not human. It never was.

— Then what is it?

— No one knows. But one thing is certain—when you notice it, it starts to notice you.

A chill ran down my spine.

— What does that mean?

— People who see him start having nightmares. They feel watched. Some of them… disappear.

— But the whole town knows about him.

— Because everyone has learned to ignore him. It’s the only way.

I clenched my fists.

— But that doesn’t make sense! If he’s hurting people, why hasn’t anyone done anything? Why hasn’t the police—

Grandma gave me a sad smile.

— And what would they do, Jack? Give him a ticket for loitering? Arrest a shadow?

I had no answer.

— You need to leave town, Jack. And forget you ever saw him.


---

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

Every rustle made me jump. Every shadow seemed longer, more unnatural. I felt like someone was standing outside my window.

At 3 a.m., I heard knocking at the door.

I froze.

It was soft. Steady. Three knocks.

I didn’t move.

Another three knocks.

Slowly, I walked to the door and peered through the peephole.

No one was there.

But when I looked outside, I saw the streetlight across from my house flicker on.

And under it, someone was standing.

Tall. Motionless.

Facing directly at me.

Then I knew.

Grandma was right.

It had noticed me.

And now, it was waiting.

I couldn’t look away.

The man under the streetlight stood there, motionless, but I could feel his gaze, even though I couldn’t see his eyes. I didn’t know how much time had passed—seconds, minutes? My heart pounded in my chest, and my breath was shallow and uneven.

And then, slowly, very slowly, his head tilted to the side.

It wasn’t a normal tilt. It was too smooth, unnatural. As if his neck had no bones. As if his body wasn’t made of the same thing as mine.

I stepped back from the door as if it had burned me.

“Don’t pay attention to him.”

Grandma always said that was the only way.

But how was I supposed to do that when he had already seen me?

I didn’t sleep until morning. I sat by the window, watching the streetlight.

At four in the morning, the figure vanished. It just… melted into the darkness.

I don’t know what I expected. Maybe that it would all turn out to be a dream? A hallucination? But when I looked at the door, I saw something that made it hard to swallow.

On the wooden surface, right next to the handle, there was a handprint. As if someone had pressed a damp hand against it.

Only, it wasn’t a normal handprint.

It had five fingers, but they were too long, too thin. As if they belonged to someone… who shouldn’t have them.


---

The next day, I decided to visit my grandma. I had to know more.

As soon as I crossed the threshold of her house, she looked at me and paled.

“He found you.”

I didn’t answer, but she must have seen it in my eyes.

She led me to the living room and shut all the curtains.

“Jack… you need to leave. Today.”

“Grandma, tell me the truth. What is this?”

She looked at me seriously.

“I don’t know. But I do know that once he notices you, he doesn’t stop.”

“I don’t understand.”

Grandma sighed and got up from the couch.

“Come.”

She led me to a room at the end of the hallway, the one I had never liked. It was old, smelled of dust and lavender, and yellowed pictures of ancestors hung on the walls.

She opened an old wooden cabinet and pulled out a small, worn box.

“This belonged to my father,” she said quietly.

I opened the box and found a few yellowed papers and a black-and-white photograph.

The photo showed a group of people standing in front of a building. They were all serious, looking directly at the camera.

But in the background, under a streetlight, there was a motionless figure.

Tall. Thin. Face hidden in shadow.

I shivered.

“This is from 1928,” Grandma said. “My father claimed he saw him for the first time then.”

I looked at her, feeling a chill run down my spine.

“For the first time?”

Grandma nodded.

“After that night, he started having nightmares. He said he felt watched. And then…” she paused for a moment. “One night, he just walked out of the house. And never came back.”

I clenched my fingers around the photo.

“And you think the same thing will happen to me?”

Grandma didn’t answer for a long time.

“No, if you leave,” she finally said. “You have to, Jack. If you stay, he’ll get closer.”

I didn’t want to believe it was true. But I knew I had no choice.

I had to run.


---

That evening, I started packing my suitcase.

I didn’t care where I was going. The only thing that mattered was leaving this place as soon as possible.

But then I heard something that made me freeze.

A knock.

Three knocks.

Slowly, I turned my head toward the door.

The knocking came again.

I didn’t step closer, but I knew.

He was there.

Waiting.


---

I didn’t open the door.

I sat on the bed, waiting for the knocking to stop.

And finally, it did.

But then I heard something worse.

A scraping sound.

Like someone slowly dragging their hand across the wood.

I felt it—if I so much as glanced through the peephole, it would all be over.

So I didn’t look.

I sat there until morning.


---

The next day, I got into my car and drove forward, never looking back.

As I left town, I felt the tension slowly leave my body.

Maybe Grandma was right. Maybe all I had to do was leave, and he would let me go.

Everything seemed calmer.

But as I merged onto the highway, something caught my attention.

On the right side, a few dozen meters from the road, stood a lone streetlight.

And under it… someone was there.

A man in a long coat.

I froze.

No. That’s impossible.

I drove past.

Don’t turn around.

Don’t look.

But in the rearview mirror, I saw the man under the streetlight slowly turn his head.

He was looking at me.

And that’s when I understood.

You can’t run from him.

You can only ignore him.

But he will always be there, somewhere in the background.

Waiting.

I was not going to give all of that information about myself to AI with complete disconnection from humanity I figured I didn't need facebook that bad anyway, fast forward to yesterday, I was moving into a new house and had some furniture that I wanted to sell off so I figured I could just create a  new account to use facebook market place to sell these items. Literally just posted one coffee table because they won't allow me to post more than one item as a new member, which I somewhat understood and was ok with (they have to make sure I am a real person and not hon there to scam someone). I figured once I had someone inquire and hopefully buy the coffee table Facebook will trust me enough to let me post the rest of my furniture. I didn't do anything else. Well I woke up this morning to and interesting email from facebook, Apparently the machine that runs the show had decided that my activity on facebook did not meet the requirements that it sets for their community so I was being suspended to be kicked off if they couldn't determine in one appeal that this decision was in error, the appeal itself only required me to take live selfies and submit to the machine, could not talk to anyone about this predicament. My point is this is the beginning of the end if these are the standards that we accept from mega cooperations like facebook with how much they profit from us paying attention to them. I am sure there are a lot of stories like mine This is an appeal to people who know what I am talking about,We can either demand more from Metta or just give way to AI right now (humanity is becoming obsolete right before our own eyes!)",1,1740505878.0,facebook,1,1.0,False

Which works when for me and the gear I use for both of them.,"This has been discussed a few times but in this I am sharing my personal experience and perspective of having travelled around the world with both setups and learning to prefer one over the other\*. Either style I have some must carrys - clothes, toiletry kit, charging kit are obvious ones, kindle/tablet, a pair of flip flops

One Bag is comfy and works for me when 

1. I know that I am going to travel in place(s) with steady and same weather. Especially if it is warm (shorts and t shirts ftw!)
2. I don't have to work and hence not be carrying a lot tech - laptop etc. Can make do with a tablet/kindle.
3. Will be visiting friends or have a car to ferry me around. 
4. I wont have any camera gear and 
5. I know I won't really be picking up things for the return

Two Bags for everything else as 

1. Airport security hack (all removables like liquids, laptops, camera gear) go into one bag for optimized security check clearance.
2. I like to travel with my coffee gear (timemore c2, pourover with filters, beans and timemore mini scale) to most places (\*as most places dont have great coffee)
3. Wider variety of clothes including buttoned downs and jeans.
4. Be ready for different kinds of weather (carry an umbrella or packable down jacket)
5. Need a spare set of shoes (for running, hiking etc).
6. Room for something more (purchases, gifts, more coffee beans :) )

# The Gear:

Carry On: **Peak Design Travel 45 Backpack** (since 2019) and this is my One Bag bag. 

It replaced the **Tom Bihn Aeronaut**\- I realized I only use the backpack style of carrying and hate the duffel style or the messenger style even with the wonderful shoulder strap)

**TravelPro Maxlite 5** \- In trips where I am not traveling a lot or with someone else I carry this.

Personal item: **Tomtoc T71 30L** v (now seems to be discontinued)  
Eying the Almond Oak (what do you think?)  
Also have **North Face Recon**  
and my OG was the **Caselogic Berkeley** (which I abused like crazy for 5+ years and still is usable except the inner lining has given and overall the bag is scuffed) 

I am a big pouches and packing cubes guy. One for toiletry (Peak Design), one for passports/cash and travel cards (planning to replace this with Bellroy Travel wallet) and one for tech stuff (chargers, cables etc)

Packing cubes owned : Peak Design, Gonex and REI. 

Sling: Bellroy Lite 7L and I ensure that this can go into the personal item when necessary. 

Packable bag: Either the Eddie Bauer one (which I have had for 8+ yrs now but looking for a new one) or newly a PD tote (esp when I am One Bagging and they want to weigh my bag I can create a personal item)

1iy10gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iy10gx/male_victim_of_abuse_need_help/,"Male victim of abuse, need help","Hi,

First off, this is a long read, but I also hope it can help other men in my situation.

I'm a 40 year old male who is the victim of domestic abuse and violence in all categories,  emotional, psychological, and physical.

I'm safe now, my wife is away for military training. Trying to make my escape here in the next 5 months.
 
Were at the impasse, I'm willing to give her one chance to do something different, because we're married and I do care about her, but she needs to take accountability for her actions. I realize this is unlikely, but still I want to try once. It means taking accountability, actively seeking individual therapy (i was already doing this because i find value in therapy, but she scared my therapist away), and actively seeking couples therapy.

A little background, she is/was my friend of 15 years, friend only, pen pal so to speak. We had eventually agreed that we were platonic after she gave up on multiple past attempts to meet. A few years ago, she changed her mind and wanted to try. Prior to all this I had been going through a massive depressive and suicidal place in my life - i was coping with it using promiscuity. This all happened before we were together in any way.

I want to make clear, I'm aware I probably should have left far earlier but something stopped me from doing so early on.

Fast forward, she finally accomplishes traveling here and we meet. The second day she's here, she goes through my phone and makes all these wild assumptions, to which I just told her honestly that I was very promiscuous when I was going through some major depression and suicidal events in my life, and added that she saved my life and gave me hope.

She raged and destroyed the gifts I bought her and told me I didn't love her.

We worked through this and talked a lot and eventually got married. But it was only after we moved that the significant abuse started.

***I want to make clear to anyone who has been abused, our past choices and mistakes are not an excuse to abuse someone as a means to express their feelings***

July 2023, my wife starts a verbal argument about ""[the whores before her]"" and other stuff, I'm in my boxers and she punches me and then strangles me next to the kitchen, I retreat to the living room, she collapses the folding chair and hits me with it, proceeds to hit me with a barrage of punches one which I parry and gently roll her away from me, I retreat to the bedroom to get dressed so I can leave the house and let her cool down, when I'm getting my pants, she appears in the room with my keys in one hand and a kitchen knife (large for meat and veggies) in the other, approaches me about 1 foot away, and threatened to kill me and then herself. I'm sobbing and I truly believe I'm going to die in this moment. She continues her raging, grabs the pants from me and we struggled for them. She screams ""you bought these jeans with those whores"" and begins to slice the pants up. She then walks out of the room, returned the knife to the kitchen drawer (I know it was the drawer knife because one is kept in the drawer and the other kitchen knife sits in the wooden knife set holder). She returns to the room, sits on the bed in a meditation position and begins meditating like nothing happened. She claims she was looking for the scissors because she was angry at the pants but grabbed the knife because she couldnt find the scissors, but she didn't even see the pants until she was in the room when I was trying to put them on - the scissors are always in the knife stand. I texted 911, they came and arrested her, officers could see i was visibly shaking and in shock. They reported that my wife was uncooperative during the arrest in the police report.

My wife was just a new arrival to the US, so she had literally fucked her possibility of immigration, but because I love her I called off work, called my lawyer friends, and worked all night and day to get her out of jail -- I was new to this state and didn't know the domestic abuse laws required the perp to be arrested no matter what and that the police must press charges. Got her out and she was grateful, however one of the first comments she made on the drive home was ""they (the prisoners and guard) don't believe I did that because you're bigger"".

Court orders her non-violent contact and to get a psychiatric evaluation. She failed the violent contact the first day by picking fights about ""whores"" and screaming in the car and at home. She refused to go to the psychiatric evaluations, but changed her mind when I explained that if she doesn't comply, the judge could have her put back in jail.

Everything that follows is after the knife event. 

This would continue for, almost now, two years. Often it starts with her bringing up ""the whores.""

On some occasions violently attacking me while in trying to drive on highways sometimes over speeds of 70mph.

One time, I asked if I could have a few drinks with my buddy, asked if she could drive home, and she said okay to driving home. When we headed home, she drove wrecklessly and violently while screaming about ""whores"", all the while knowing I have severe passenger anxiety I do fine with most people. I refuse to be here passenger since then.

She has destroyed my property and claimed it was ""a gift from whores"" - it was a gift from a colleague at my first big job. She has destroyed other property at home. 

She kicked my car after a nice trip to a city I had a customer at, I didn't even need to being her. It started with her suddenly bringing up a specific ex-girlfriend (which has no significance in my life) then going on about whores, another incident where she assaulted me while I was in the highway. She kicked my car door when we arrived home.

On a few occasions at our apartment, she has screamed ""I will kill myself"" when I went to leave the apartment to de-escalate what I knew would turn into a fight. I took a drive to get some coffee to calm down and she called me and said ""I will kill myself and you don't care or love me,"" then I called the police with this first incident to do a wellness check, I couldn't stay there. The second event, I just went for a walk and she calmed down, knowing she was bluffing.

I tried to help her with her unemployment. Her boss was a former friend of mine. She quit on circumstances of discrimination. I helped her at an appeal hearing but there want enough. When we got home, she said ""I got scared and wanted to be friends with my old friend again"" (no, I was disgusted my former friend abused her position and failed to protect my wife), then called me a bitch and pussy. I was simply trying to help her with her unemployment and still have tried after that.

She has thrown objects and water on me at home.

She belittles me saying the car I bought her so she could be independent and have a job (brand new) ""wasn't a BMW"". 

She threw her friend under the bus, gaslighting her friend into believing I was the abuser. I told her you leave after this, he friend came by (disillusioned by my wifes lies) helped her take all her stuff. My wife after a day or two ""missed me"" and wanted to see me. So we did, we tried a fresh start. After a few days longer, she told her friend she  wanted to go home. Her friend was pissed, and describe me wife's actions as ""having shit on her"" after all she has done for her.

The most recent abuse was her starting an argument when she was at training, her claiming I ""would start shit"" at her graduation. I ended that call and told her I was my coming. Another act of her abuse, this time passive aggressive using false assumptions and projection.

Since then we haven't talked.

There are other small things, like she was allegedly abused by her ex-husband, but when she called him for something related to selling a house, he sounded aggrieved and his words were those of someone who had been cheated on and had been betrayed. I can only speculate on this but, it doesn't match her description of events. And then there is her denial of all the past relationships she used to always contact me about and ask me for advice about.

Am I crazy? Am I being abused? I surely know I am, but I feel so fucking hopeless right now.

I want to help her get help, but my instinct says ""run the fuck away and disappear"".

Please help.

Thank you for your time.

His work has really blown up on a lot of social media, and I've saved a lot of his content for a rainy day. A lot has happened in my life these last few years, and I'd really like to read more of his work in their true context for some solace. Maybe we can hive mind finding the sources of these quotes?

The attributions to his work are so pervasive but lack any citations of titles/bodies of work/etc. that I'm starting to think much of it could be fake news. There have been a couple reddit posts addressing his poems here and there (some stating that they were misattributed and actually written by another writer), but nothing conclusive has been made from what I can gather.

These are the quotes I'm curious about:

\#1

>They asked, ""Do you love her to death?""

>I said, ""Speak of her over my grave and watch how she brings me back to life.""

\#2

>I have passed by many eyes but only got lost in yours.

\#3

>You won't find the same person twice, not even in the same person.

\#4

>If it was a piece of paper,

>I would tear it.

>If it was a bottle, I would break it.

>If it was a wall, I would tear it

>down – But it's my heart.

\#5

>How do I say I miss you in a way that will make your heart ache as mine does?

\#6

>All roads lead to you,

>even the ones I took

>to forget you.

\#7

>Love me without asking why. Love me as the night loves the moon, as the sea loves its tides, as the soul loves the idea of eternity. I love you more than anything on this earth, more than the scene of a jasmine flower or the breath of a morning breeze. I am jealous of my words when I speak to you. How could they touch your heart, when my hands cannot?

>Maybe the moon is beautiful only because it is far.

\#9

>And you became like the coffee in the deliciousness and the bitterness and the addiction.

\#10

>I loved you in a way I wished someone would love me.

The kind of money where I could have paid off the remainder of my parents' house and they enjoy their retirement. I could pay for their vacations.

Had the job interview and the owner was honest, I was not their first pick because I did not have as many years experience that they'd like to have, but their recruiter mentioned that I had secondary/tertiary skills that made me an interesting candidate - and they wanted to hire another ""greener"" person to mentor. The interview was an hour long. I got the owner laughing, he even decided to give me a tour of the property. He said that I would hear back from him soon. He gave me the address of the second company location and asked me to visit it. I knew that this interview didn't mean a job offer, but the chemistry had me thinking I had a chance. 

Radio silence. I message the recruiter and he tells me that they decided not to move forward with me. I asked if he would keep me in the loop/send me more job offers, he essentially said in a professional way that ""Sure I'll hold onto your resume but you should find the job offers yourself then connect with me.""

It turns out after the update someone recognized me and came to talk to me about the truth, it turns out that while that was happening apening more details where omitted.

First of the short story is that six months ago I caught my gf cheating on me, after some signs it was happening, she broke up with the guy she was cheating on me with and found someone new.

However here is the funny part like I said in that story, we had broken up in January last year and 2 weeks later reconciled, or so I thought.

After the update on that post a friend of her new boyfriend(and old classmate of mine), come to talk to me and said that she and her new boyfriend had been seeing eachother since January/February and had officially begun dating in August.

Meaning I was being used since then, I had a mental breakdown and all of that(I am better now, but not 100%), and also meaning she was cheating on him and me with a third party.

It gets worse in late September after having broken up with her, I had a slip up and went to her house and we ended up having oral sex, but I did come to my senses and ended it there.

Mind you I only need she had a boyfriend when her daughter told me in December(last update), and did not know she was using me to cheat on someone(this is really breaking me).

I want to cut all ties with her but because I am a family friend and she owes me a lot of money(she is actively paying), I can't but she uses that to occasionally ask me to go have a coffee with her or send's messages by ""mistake"".

Now cut to around 2 weeks ago I meet one of her ex's, the one she went to visit while drunk in the last post, and he tells me that although that time they did not have sex, she went there another time and they did have sex(he was not aware I existed back then).

And only told me now because of shame and he new I liked her, he told me that what she is doing with me the messages and coffee dates, she is also doing with him.

And for the great finally of revelations he tells me that her new boyfriend is someone she has dated before and never let go off, only I did not know that(talked to someone of her family members who thought I knew).

So not only did this woman play with my feelings and that of other man, she literally cheated on every last one of us, by using eachother.

Now I have a problem, her current boyfriend doesn't know she used me to cheat on him(and I decided no to tell, he as done the same to her), and that is making me feel groos and used.

Know I have found someone that is being patient with me and helping me out through this tough time, and although I really like her I don't feel I can trust her( even though she as been nothing but patient and helpful).

And although we have yet to make it official I would  like to do so, but only after I feel comfortable, I do not want to use her as a way to bounce back and then leave her, she knows the entire story and was with me when I received a ""accidental"" porn video from my ex, claiming that she wanted to met me to do that.

Like I said this is just a vent, I am doing better and hopefully will be able to return to the better me sonner rather than later, but this only comes to show that sometimes we are blinded by love, and don't really know the other person as much as we think.

Please feel free to discuss and hopefully it will help someone in a similar situation.",7,1740505413.0,GuyCry,5,1.0,False

I have a somewhat basic setup (Kingrinder K6, a cheap scale, and a cheap gooseneck kettle, and a ceramic hario switch) and buy as quality beans as I can find. 

I have a very basic understanding of how different variables affect the cup but definitely have significantly more to learn. The thing for me is honestly when I change any of the variables I don’t even taste a change in my cup. I’ve been enjoying my coffee as it tastes pretty vibrant, but definitely am not getting the nuances of each bean through what I’m doing. 

Whether I change water temp from 95-> 90, or grind setting from something like 90 clicks to 80 clicks, or especially a different recipe, I’m still enjoying the cup but I know its not as good as it could be. I’ve been wow’d by some cafe pourovers and I’d say I’m maybe getting 70% out of these beans at home. 

Also with each recipe I’m pretty much just pouring in circles from no specific height. All I know about the pour is that it affects the agitation (higher up and wider circles = more agitation = higher extraction??).

(rant),"When I started studying software engineering I went into it ""from the bottom"". It was so interesting to me to see how computers function, I was literally writing assembly programs for microcontrollers that I myself soldered into the board, and even played with FPGA for a little bit. I enjoyed low-level, I enjoyed tedious memory management and performance optimization. I still barely write any interpreted programming language, because anything above C++ in level of abstraction is just not enjoyable to me anymore. I tried writing python for a few months, taking over a temporary job in my company, and almost hanged myself in the process. Even python was ""too high"" for me. Now imagine how I feel about all this AI bullshit.

Thankfully, right now I work on a high-performance telecom software with a fairly complex domain, and I don't find AI models available to us to be useful for anything but boilerplating and replacing google search. So far, LLMs have not been useful to us, but I can imagine them being more tightly integrated into the IDEs and being more tightly-fitted into our working pipeline in the future. If that is the case, then I will probably leave tech altogether. I already stopped studying new things, because the hype around AI prevents me from thinking long-term about my career. I have to think about other options instead.

I don't care about productivity, shareholders, app deployment in 2 hours, and groundbreaking technological innovation. I don't care about all this marvelous slop AI is going to generate for us. I don't care about dancing spaghetti or a cat drinking coffee in a cozy coffee shop on a rainy day. I just want to do my job myself, and be fulfilled and proud of it. Ideally, I want my labour to be useful to society in some way. I want to look at the beautiful code I wrote and be like ""damn, I'm so good"". I want to express myself with my labour.

I want to see other people's fruits of effort, their music, and their art. Not just an idea that was typed into a chat bot, but human skill, dedication, and passion.

What saddens me, is that I'm seemingly in a minority, as internet hypes everything AI-related to an extreme, and people write comments about ""tremendously increased productivity"" as if their own brain is running GPT now. I understand why companies do this, but people endorsing AI takeover just look sad to me. I hope for an uprising against AI, but this hope is waning more and more every day, as more and more people give up and start using it. Even my friend, who was skeptical of AI, recently said that ""he might've been too harsh on them"".

I don't know whether AI (read LLM) will ever be good enough to be what promoters and enthusiasts claim it to be. But for those few of us, who found this technology to be repulsive and disgusting, the only way to break out of it seems to be [the new Swiss suicide pod](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59577162).",0,1740505345.0,ArtificialInteligence,25,0.42,False

I’ve been using pre-ground illy coffee suitable for moka pot preparation. When using my 3 cup pot I actually don’t pre-heat the water, I find its not necessary/ makes it more bitter (for my 6/9 cup pots I do pre heat). The extraction comes out to the top chamber at around ~6m30s, where I turn it to low and let it complete. If I put it to the lowest setting it could take a tremendous amount of time, like upwards of 5 minutes to completely come out. When this happens, the puck looks great, but I notice not all the water makes it into the top chamber.
Now, when I started using hand ground whole beans, grinding to a similar fineness, it takes about the same time, but the first pouring is noticeably more frothy, something I see on your guys videos. The extraction time is much quicker, 30-45s for the entire top chamber to fill. I actually get nervous its too fast so I lower it all the way and its still fast. The pot also now makes the classic gurgling noise, so I cut it early once that starts and cool it with water. The puck looks good, not as good as before but I suspect I’m not filling it all the way. The flavor from freshly ground whole beans is not even comparable, it makes such a wonderful coffee, tasting better then its ever have. I’m not even sure what I should be tasting for to understand if anything needs to be tweaked, I’m so happy with the way its come out. Anyone have any thoughts on why there is such a difference with seemingly very similar methods and ingredients? Any suggestions for improvements? Thanks!",7,1740505255.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

Being my first espresso machine, I needed to purchase a lot of things. I’m hoping to hear some feedback on really good espresso beans I can send away for and if I should consider purchasing anything else. 

Purchased list:

- Flair 58 plus 2
- Turin DF64 Gen 2
- Fellow stagg EKG Kettle
- Sworksdesign design WDT
- Sworksdesign seamless magmatic funnel
- Sworksdesign puck disc screen
- Sworksdesign flat filter paper
- Normcore V5 Spring Loaded Tamper
- Normcore Espresso Corner Tamping Station V3
- Bookoo Themis mini scale
- Normcore Espresso Corner Tamping Station V3
- Airscape coffee container


I’d still like to purchase a milk frother/steamer and am intrigued by these four options:

- the morning dream frother (doesn’t seem easy to get in USA)
- meticulous milk frother (still on preorder so no reviews)
- NanoFoamer PRO (a bit nervous about cleaning this one)
- Dreo barista maker (seems decent, easier to clean, and cheaper than the NanoFoamer)


My wishlist, but didn’t seem critical to purchase immediately:

- knockout box (Normcore heavy-duty looks nice)
- VST or IMS baskets (I need to do a lot more research and want to try the flair baskets first)
- potentially a different portafilter (same as above. I need more research and want to try flair portafilter first)
- cleaning supplies (not sure where to start but will research)

I’m curious—what locations do you guys recommend for meeting buyers when selling high-value items like a GPU? My go-to spot for lower-value items (under $200) is usually a gas station, but for anything over $500, I prefer a more secure location.

I’ve tried meeting in front of my local police station, but since it’s just a parking lot, last time we met, it was literally just us with a bunch of cars around with no one around and there’s nothing to physically prevent a buyer from grabbing the item and running. While meeting in front of a police station likely deters most scammers or thieves, I’d feel even safer in a location where we could meet **inside** a building with people around.

I was considering a bank, as it offers a secure environment where I can wait for the buyer to walk through the door before we meet. However, I’m not sure if my bank allows this, so I’d have to check. Other public places like Walmart or Starbucks don’t seem ideal, as exchanging cash in a busy area could attract unwanted attention.

Does anyone know of stores or businesses that allow buyers and sellers to meet inside? Not sure about meeting inside a police station, if they even allow it. Just need some place with high foot traffic and potential witnesses in case something goes wrong thats not a mall/coffee shop/resturant",1,1740504894.0,FacebookMarketplace,13,1.0,False

Back in Berlin, he didn’t have to hop into a flying car to avoid risking his life on the city streets. Moreover, back home, there was no degree of horrific poverty that even came close to what he saw in Vargos in passing. When flying from the airport to wherever his meetings were in the city, they always passed over the monstrosity of waste that locals called “The Roman Stacks.” It made his stomach turn to see the masses of people living their lives in what could generously be compared to a landfill.

The wickedness of Vargos really hit home for Hans when he first saw the luxury of the Downtown district on his initial visit, but even Downtown looked like a slum compared to where the car dropped him off this time. The district was called “Chimera Heights” on official city maps, but he’d heard it referred to in passing as “Eden.” It made some sense—the place was manicured to such a degree that, when he looked closely, not a single bush had a dying leaf on it, and the pavement didn’t have so much as a crack or a pebble out of place.

He wandered up to the sleek building he had been instructed to enter upon arrival—a silver tower that hurt the eyes when the sun reflected off its mirror-like surface. It was built in the new “Acus” style that left fields of thin, needle-like skyscrapers in its wake. The buildings were an eyesore to Hans, but the style was quickly growing in popularity among the global elite, especially where corporations like Violet held sway.

He entered the building’s lobby and was greeted by more blinding lights, made even more jarring by the crisp white of the furniture, walls, and tile flooring, interrupted only by the deep black of the sharp corners and the brilliant blue of the water in the lobby’s main fountain. He saw a massive glass elevator in the center of the lobby that led up to the spire’s peak; by rough estimate, at least seventy floors. He approached the circular reception desk and was greeted by a projected hologram of a woman’s face. This was the AI he’d read about on the car ride here: GHM’s “Ethera.” She scanned Hans in a split second and then greeted him in an uncannily human voice.

“Hans Becker. Violet Class A employee, Berlin Division. Employee ID: 186YR4L-9E. Welcome to GHM Eden Tower 2. Your appointment is scheduled for 9:00 AM with Mercy Ebrahimi, GHM Class A employee, Vargos Division. Employee ID: 999UG3W-7X. Would you like any coffee or water while you wait?”

Hans hated to admit when he was impressed, but he had to give it to GHM—this reception wasn’t bad.

“Espresso, please. Two sugars, one cream.”

“Of course,” the hologram shut its eyes for a moment, then opened them as a small glass cup of espresso rose from the reception desk’s counter, steam gently lifting from its top. He took the coffee and opened a program on his internal user interface, projected into his vision, and saw he had six minutes before the meeting.

“Is there a place to smoke here?”

“Yes, sir. Please enjoy your coffee and smoked product on the balcony behind this desk. Please say ‘Ethera,’ and I will arrive to help with anything you need.”

Hans wandered out to the balcony and took in its view. Chimera Heights was built on the only hill in Vargos that hadn’t been leveled during the city’s rapid expansion and construction. From the balcony, he could see what locals might call a “view” of the city, its smog hanging over it in an enormous black cloud that blocked out the tops of most buildings, interrupted only by the constant flashing of neon lights people seemed so fond of. He savored his espresso and cigarette and looked around the balcony to see only a lone woman in a striking pantsuit taking in the view just feet away. Taking a closer look, he realized it was the woman he was here to meet—Mercy Ebrahimi. He wandered over and gave her a kind wave.

“Hello! You know we have a meeting soon?” he said in jest.

She shot him a smile, then turned to look over her shoulder at the lobby. People walked across its white floor without giving the two of them a second look. She turned back and gave him a serious glare.

“Hans. We have five minutes now before that AI shows up to remind us of our meeting, and then we won’t be able to speak privately again. So when I say shut the hell up and let me talk now, I want you to nod and do exactly that. Do you understand?”

Hans was flustered. Mercy had always been gentle and funny when they’d met in Paris for meetings or other extracurricular activities in their hotel rooms, but she wasn’t showing any warmth here. Her arms were folded across her chest, and she was hunched over slightly, unbecoming for any executive. Hans nodded hesitantly then took another drag of his cigarette.

“When you walk into the office today for our scheduled meeting, Violet is going to liquidate you. They’re downsizing the Berlin office, but they didn’t want to risk you trying to escape the city if they let you go remotely.”

Hans felt his blood run cold. The cigarette slipped from his fingers as his limbs went numb, the sound of Mercy’s voice deafening beneath the noise coming from his pounding heart. He opened his mouth to speak but no words came out, just a strangled breath that hardly passed out of his throat.

“You need to walk back out the entrance door and use your ID badge to get a flying taxi from here to a district called Neon Heights. Do not look back. Do not stop for anything. Once there, you need to find a bar called ‘Benziz’ and ask for a white martini. They’ll take you into the back, and you’ll be given a new personal chit. With that, you should be able to get some work done at a salon to change your hair and face, and hopefully, that should be enough to get you on a plane to a city where Violet isn’t dominant. I recommend London or Tehran.”

She looked over her shoulder again. She’d said everything so matter-of-factly that Hans almost missed the urgency underlying every word. He checked the clock on his interface again.

Three minutes.

“Mercy, I don’t understand,” he said as he grabbed her hand. She didn’t pull away.

“I’m sorry, Hans. I can’t tell you who gave me the information, but you have to trust that it’s verified. If you can’t get out of the city, then you need to go underground, and I mean that literally. The district called Low Vargos is where most people run when they want to escape something.”

Two minutes.

“Mercy, I haven’t done anything to warrant this! My outputs are far above standard. I was part of the bonus rounds for the last five years. Why would I be liquidated?”

“I don’t know, Hans. You have to go right now. We can’t talk about this anymore. I’m sorry.”

“What will happen if I can’t leave? What is this Low Vargos like? ”

“I don’t know. I’ve never been. No Class-A employee would ever. But it’s that or you’re liquidated upstairs. You’ll have maybe thirty minutes after the meeting to get a head start, but then your ID will be burned in the system, and your name will be on a Wraith list. They’ll track you in minutes and you’ll be aethered, just another ghost in the system.”

She pulled her hand away and shot him a look that sent a chill down his spine. He remembered the times he’d seen her smile, seen her giggle coming out of the shower or waking up next to him, seen her tell a joke in a boardroom, almost fluffing her feathers with pleasure as the other executives laughed. She just looked worried and tired now.

One minute.

“Go!” she said, almost yelling as she looked over his shoulder again.

Hans didn’t hesitate. As jarring as this all was, he’d worked for Violet long enough to take it seriously. He walked back through the glass doors into the white lobby and headed toward the exit.

Ethera appeared again as a hologram on the desk as the clock hit 9:00 AM. Her eyes locked onto him but didn’t just register him like it had before, it was dissecting him, cataloguing every microexpression and movement he made. He could feel it running predictive models on what the slightest next muscle movement he made might be. He hustled to the door, his back almost burning as he felt the program’s eyes on him.

He took one last look back but didn’t see Mercy, instead he saw the hologram as it shifted from its brilliant blue to a deep and vibrant red.

“Mercy, I haven’t done anything to warrant this! My outputs are far above standard. I was part of the bonus rounds for the last five years. Why would I be liquidated?”

“I don’t know, Hans. You have to go right now. We can’t talk about this anymore. I’m sorry.”

“What will happen if I can’t leave? What is this Low Vargos like? ”

“I don’t know. I’ve never been. No Class-A employee would ever. But it’s that or you’re liquidated upstairs. You’ll have maybe thirty minutes after the meeting to get a head start, but then your ID will be burned in the system, and your name will be on a Wraith list. They’ll track you in minutes and you’ll be aethered, just another ghost in the system.”

She pulled her hand away and shot him a look that sent a chill down his spine. He remembered the times he’d seen her smile, seen her giggle coming out of the shower or waking up next to him, seen her tell a joke in a boardroom, almost fluffing her feathers with pleasure as the other executives laughed. She just looked worried and tired now.

One minute.

“Go!” she said, almost yelling as she looked over his shoulder again.

Hans didn’t hesitate. As jarring as this all was, he’d worked for Violet long enough to take it seriously. He walked back through the glass doors into the white lobby and headed toward the exit.

Ethera appeared again as a hologram on the desk as the clock hit 9:00 AM. Her eyes locked onto him but didn’t just register him like it had before, it was dissecting him, cataloguing every microexpression and movement he made. He could feel it running predictive models on what the slightest next muscle movement he made might be. He hustled to the door, his back almost burning as he felt the program’s eyes on him.

He took one last look back but didn’t see Mercy, instead he saw the hologram as it shifted from its brilliant blue to a deep and vibrant red. Its eyes remained locked on Hans as he hailed a waiting taxi, his clammy hands hardly able to rise to get the driver’s attention.",2,1740504685.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I was in LA visiting a producer friend at his home. He had his laptop open and mentioned needing to fill out his ballot.

He was showing off all the screener links he'd received when he admitted he hadn't seen a single nominated movie.

We watched football. We door dashed fajitas.

He continued filling out his ballot.

He chose earnestly at first, providing semi-thoughtful commentary like ""I hate that dude"", ""I like his films"", and ""I never heard of her"".

I told him she was good, but he voted for the one he had heard of.

Then the fajitas arrived.

He chucked his laptop to the side of the coffee table.

There was much assembling of fajitas.

He completed his ballot willy nilly and submitted it.

This was last month by the way and since then he told me he's seen half of Dune.

They're also semi-active on Instagram (@ atxmarket), where you can find their menu along with some pics and promotional posts.

1iy0cpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1iy0cpb/tactile_grounding_therapy/,Tactile Grounding Therapy,"I’m looking for advice and thoughts about a recent situation I’ve found myself in.

I (34f) have a friend (43m). We started off as college buddies in 2008 and reconnected in 2017 as friends. We see each other every few months for coffee and don’t talk much outside of memes and the occasional text. He’s cool but I wouldn’t say we’re close friends. He is bipolar and has struggled with major depression for most of his adult life. He said he is going through a lot right now and had a strange request for me.

I’m seeing him on Sunday and he asked if I’ll be wearing jeans. In the past, he has made comments about my butt and how good it looks in jeans, so I assumed it was about that. I never felt uncomfortable with him commenting on my figure before because I was single. However, I’m in a very positive and assuring relationship now that I immediately felt awkward with him asking about the opportunity to check out my ass. If my boyfriend asked another girl the same question, I’d be really upset. I told my friend this, and he said he started “tactile grounding” and it would be helpful for him to touch my jeans in an “appropriate place” so when he touches jeans, he’ll associate it with me. He said he has a tin with items and he would have a swatch of an old pair of his jeans to associate it with me, because asking for a pair of him seems excessive to him. 

Now … I’m trying to be open minded and give my friend some space and latitude because he’s going through a hard time and is trying new methods and is on a new medication. However, this request seems very weird to me. I’ve been reading about tactile grounding and I don’t see this as a method of treatment. But I’m in therapy myself and understand there are different methods that work for different people. 

Is tactile grounding with friends a common treatment? Would you let your friend touch you this way, knowing that to him, jeans means the way he thinks of you physically? I want to be a good friend but I think this is way too past my comfort. But am I being too selfish? ",1,1740504102.0,therapy,1,1.0,False

For anyone on the fence about attending, here's my unfiltered take.

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was electric. you could practically feel the collective energy of hundreds of people hungry for transformation.

The speaker lineup was STACKED. Priscilla Shirer, Ed Mylett? That man doesn't just talk about legacy - he makes you question what footprint you're leaving on this world in a way that kept me up that night. And Tim Tebow brought that unique blend of humility and fire that reminded me why I've always respected him beyond his sports career.

during the coffee breaks, I found myself swapping stories with complete strangers who somehow felt like old friends. We shared vulnerabilities, dreams, and contact info. Those connections made the whole experience feel more authentic and grounded.

I have cleaned everything up (more gross pictures soon), replaced the thermostats and thermal fuse (someone must have cut it out before, that's why the boiler heated up indefinitely). While crimping the wires (which I bodged an will redo anyways) I have noticed that the wiring is different than what I saw on the diagram from Gaggia's website, and different from what I saw in some pictures as well, most notably, two of the boiler terminals are connected to each other diagonally, instead of rear left going into the lowest brew switch terminal and front right to the lowest power button terminal.

So the question is: were Romanian made GCs wired differently, or somebody was in there, cut the fuse out and scrambled all of the rest while they were at it? Any info or wiring diagrams will be much appreciated, before I'm going to melt it all again trying to rewire 🫠

Part-time making 15/hr 20 hours a week while I was going to college. I had been out of the military maybe a week and the interview was at 9am about an hour from my parents. 

I woke up at 5ish as per usual, got ready, suit and tie, shined shoes, fresh shave, fresh haircut the day before. Feeling good. I start driving there, listening to music to hype myself up. It’s 7am and I stopped at a coffee shop to get some coffee, have one, have another and then decided around 8 that I should eat some food. I got a sausage and egg and cheese croissant which was delicious. It’s 8:30 now so I go to the office and park by the dumpster in the back of the parking lot. More music, practicing my elevator pitch, getting hyped up to crush my interview.

At 8:45ish my stomach dropped through the fucking floor of my car and the loudest audible gurgling I’ve heard to this day. I said, “oh fuck”, turned the car off and went to get out of the car and without any control, shit my pants. Not a shart but a full liquid discharge. I fucking paaaanicked. I get back in my car, drop my pants and luckily nothing on my slacks but everything else is a fucking nightmare of destruction. Take my underwear off, clean myself with some napkins, put my slacks and shoes back on, dumped the evidence in the dumpster and start jogging to the office to go to the bathroom to wash myself. 

I walk-in and go to the front desk and ask for the bathroom. Receptionist says I have to sign-in and get approval from the person who I’m meeting with and I can’t go to the bathroom until I’m let in by the hiring manager. 

Heart sinks and all I could think is how badly I’m fucked. The smell…is noticeable, I can smell myself and I’m panicking still. Hiring manager comes through at 8:55. “Hey! Great to meet you!” And my worst known fear, he reaches out to shake my hand and my mind played 500 scenarios in a millisecond and I said fuck it, and shook his hand. I told him I needed to use the restroom real quick and so I headed to the bathroom to wash myself.

Get into the office to start the interview, smell is there and now mixed with an overwhelming smell of ass and lavender, and I know he smelled it because he made noticeable scrunching of his nose but he never said anything. I’m a nervous wreck and bombed the interview. I have an assessment that I have to take to showcase technical skills, which thankfully I aced.

I have been using Chemex for around 6 years now every day. I use the typically medium-coarse grind, and about 75g coffee to 1000ml water. 

My wife fell off the coffee train, so I am trying to reduce my batch size to a single 500ml serving and thought it would be as simple as just halving the water and beans to 37g coffee to 500ml water. The problem I am experiencing is using the same grind, ratio and technique, the 1000ml batch comes out strong which I like, but the 500ml batch comes out too thin. 

  
What should I look at tweaking to get to a more aligned outcome? I have tried pouring more slowly, but the water drains at the same speed or greater than it does for the larger 1l batch. I have also tried pouring more quickly, hoping a greater volume of water in contact with the beans would help create a stronger brew to no avail.

  
Figuring this out would mean I could spend half as much on coffee and that would be great for the budget.

I’ve only had one, and while I’m impressed with the results I do not plan on having another. Simply because micro needling is going to be a more effective for the acne scars.

It wasn’t painful at all, maybe around the nostrils… Afterwards, my face felt a little warm. Not as bad as a sunburn. I had a little redness afterwards, but was 100% fine the next day. Aside from the “coffee grounds” you couldn’t really tell I had anything done at first. I feel like the improvement has been gradual. 

I really feel like it brought my skin to life and helped improve the texture. If the BBL targets one of your problem areas, I’d recommend having it done! They recommend three treatments for best results.

Just an fyi, one half of my face has burn scars, hence the different texture and coloration. I am not trying to get rid of those. Treatment is rather invasive and I’ve embraced them.

I grind roughly by time then add small bumps of additional time to finish. If I overshoot i can use a small spoon to remove and discard a few tenths of a gram of grounds. I do sometimes single dose also, though don't prefer as a workflow.

I tried grinding by time originally. But I found it to be needlessly complex as did not make anything better.

1. Time was ALWAYS a proxy measurement for dose weight anyway... so there's an initial calibration needed to equate say, 8 seconds of grinding to 20g of output.
2. Time:Dose varies significantly with many factors: Bean size/origin/roast, how much is in the hopper, grind size. It makes it very hard to make adjustments as one of the variables is literally unknown to significant precision.
3. Dialing in shots was hard with timed grinding: If a shot flowed too quickly, the instinct is to reduce grind size... and the result was often that the shot wouldn't slow down... because reducing grind size would result in less grounds produced in the same time, the dose would go down too... and the shot would still be fast.

I'm not a by weight devotee: For clever dripper brews I grind by time and don't even bother weighting coffee or water. I know the rough amounts and get a great cup with little fuss. For pourovers I also grind by time and subtly adjust water volume for ratios needed.

There's probably some crossover point in volume (tens of shots per day?) where time-based grinding may become accurate enough and work well enough, but in the home setting I find it hard to believe.

Ultimately, my thesis is that **dose weight is what we care about... so we should just measure dose weight instead of some proxy of it.**",3,1740503900.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

No more saying, ""I'll have a Java Chip Frappuccino"" and calling it a day. Now you’ll need to specify every little thing that goes into your drink, and I’m sure that’ll come with an extra charge too. It’s not like we were already spending a small fortune on coffee.

I’m just predicting it now: this whole situation is going to blow up. The backlash will be *epic*.

The smells of cooked fish, butter, herbs, and garlic permeated the small galley, and five figures sat in the cozy light cast by LEDs immitating the flickering illumination of oil lamps.  Jason hadn't touched his dinner of xenos fish and taproots.  Nobody had touched their dinners either.  There was a pall of anticipation in the way.  A distracting uncertainty as he and the other three children looked to Vincent.
 
Jason could guess at what Vincent had to tell them.  He decided to hold his silence anyway.  Whether Vincent liked it or not, he was the captain of *The Long Way,* and telling was his right and responsibility.
 
""Bad news,"" the man rumbled and fell silent.
 
The silence stretched, filled only by the ever present hums and buzzing of ship's systems.  *The Long Way* herself didn't overstep her place.
 
""Bad news is, we're a lot further out than I'd originally thought.  We're past the predictive charts, well on the other side of the former Axxaakk Dominion.""
 
""The Axxaakk Reformation?"" Trandrai asked helpfully as she leaned into Jason.  He tried to be solid for her.
 
""No, I mean past the old Dominion borders.""
 
""Oh,"" she said as she shrank into Jason's shoulder.
 
""That's right, oh.  Now, we know the general direction to go.""
 
""Rimward?"" Vai asked hopefully.
 
""Yup, rimward.  It's just we don't have any charts of where we are, so we'll have to go by what our sensors can pick up with a hyperping.""
 
""Aye mister, but I figure we can do something about the charts.""
 
""How so, kid?""
 
""That planet was settled,"" Jason said, and laid a battered tablet on the table, ""and I found this in one of the houses.  Trandrai might be able to get it powered up again, and maybe the ship's computers can pull something useful from its memory.  That's if you'll let her borrow some tools.""
 
""Go for it, can't hurt anything,"" Vincent said, ""I didn't see any other evidence of settlements on my hunt… how were the houses built?""
 
""Metal and plaster with siding prefabs, looks like,"" Jason said soberly.
 
""Colony world, maybe?"" Stowaway asked with narrow eyes, ""But what happened to the colonists?""
 
""I figure they were attacked.  Found lots of scorch marks around.""
 
""I didn't notice,"" Stowaway softly muttered.
 
""Don't worry about it kid,"" Vincent said as he laid a calloused hand on Stowaway's head, ""he's an RNI brat.  They tend to pick up on things from the military types they hang around with.""
 
Janson slid the tablet toward Trandrai and said, ""Here, get with Mister Vincent later about the tools, okay?""
 
""Aye, sir,"" she said and only grinned as he rolled his eyes.
 
""I don't get it,"" Stowaway said as he ran his narrowed eyes around the table.
 
""I don't really understand either,"" Vai softly murmured as she tried and failed to slow the twitching of her ears, ""Please explain.""
 
""Well, to begin with coreward currents run faster than rimward ones.  I don't really get why, so don't ask,"" Jason began as he thought he saw a mischievous glint grow behind Vincent's eye, ""and the one we rode took us right past all of the former Dominion space still being surveyed, so far out that even the predictive charts don't match.""
 
""Which means?"" Stowaway asked with an impatient click of his beak.
 
Jason decidedly disliked the smirk creeping across Vincent's mug as he said with patience, ""That means we're not a month or two out from Republican or CIP space.  We're at least a year out.""  The smirk became a grin, and Jason said, ""Don't you *dare,* mister.""
 
""You know, you make a pretty good copilot,"" Vincent said as the grin widened and his eyes sparkled with glee.
 
""Don't you do it!""
 
""And you're a good leader too.  Some might even say you *took command,* kid.""
 
""Stop it, mister!  Stop it right now!""
 
""I kinda think I might need a lieutenant for such a long trip,"" Vincent said as he broke out in a mirthful, mischievous smile.
 
Vincent had the immense satisfaction of watching the kid actually act like a kid as he turned beat red and looked around in a wild panic for an escape, ""Nooo!"" he cried when one was not forthcoming, and buried his face in his hands mumbling, ""Nobody'll ever let me live this down.""
 
Vincent couldn't contain his mirth as he wheezed, ""I didn't believe it was true!""
 
""The youngest George *ever to be commissioned,*"" Trandrai japed.
 
Stowaway looked to the George boy, then toward Vincent and said, ""Didn't think what was true.""
 
""That not a one of us wants to be an officer,"" the blushing boy moaned miserably, ""please take it back, mister.  It's not even an infantry commission.""
 
""Chief, then,"" Vincent comprimised as he reached over to gently chuck the George kid on the chin, ""and you need to learn how to take a complement.  Good God, kid, I always thought that was just a story.""
 
""People are always ready to doubt the truth and swallow a lie,"" he muttered darkly, ""it's a lot more exciting to believe in a family destined for greatness and glory, and ignore every cross with a George under it on Repose.""
 
""I'm sorry kid, that's not what I meant,"" Vincent softly told him.
 
The George kid just stabbed his fish with his fork and crammed some of the flaky white meat into his mouth.  An uneasy silence fell over the table, and it sat there until he swallowed his bite and said with dire menace, ""Fine.  I'll be your chief, *sir,* but remember I will get you back for this.  When you least expect it, you will be pranked.  The fish tastes good Vai, thanks for catching and cooking it.""
 
""Tran helped,"" Vai mumbled with a nervous flick of her ears.
 
""A little,"" Trandrai muttered, and everyone tucked in.  Trandrai jostled her cousin, and he gave her a wan grin full of exasperated humor.
 
""I have my own lead,"" Vincent said as he took his own bite.  It was delicious.  Especially in comparison to what might have been generously called his usual fare.  ""I ran a hyperping, and there's a system about a week rimward by widdershins with heavy EM activity, a couple gas giants, and potentially multiple habitable worlds.  Could be a good spot to passively gather a little data.""
 
Vincent watched calculations behind the George boy's eyes before he said, ""We're good on supplies, we can keep having proper meals like this for a month or a little more.  Seasonings will be a problem after that unless we can find tasty herbs of some kind in the wild.""
 
""Noted,"" Vincent said, ""the main thing will be the hyperspace journey.  I'm not traveling alone anymore, so I can't just…""
 
""Aye mister, I'll split a watch with you.  Four on four off?""
 
""Should work,"" Vincent said.  He needed a drink.  Memmories of Call needed banishing once again.
 
In the morning, *The Long Way* had full water tanks, and fresh air, she lifted off the planet under Vincent's steady hand while the smells of another cooking breakfast tantalized him from the galley.  The George boy had given him coffee, he'd checked it, and it was just coffee.  One translation to hyperspace later, and he took his coffee into the galley to sup on sausages, potatoes from the pirate ship, and fresh fruit.  The kids chatted mostly about various shows, movies, or entertainers they liked.  Vincent didn't really understand most of their references.  Then, after he showed the kids how to adjust the gravity in the weight room, he pulled a four hour shift, followed by four hours off, then another shift, then a return to the bottle to find sleep enough to do it all again.
 
However, sleep was not as forthcoming as he'd hoped, however.  He stumbled out of his cramped room to answer nature's call, and noticed that the George boy wasn't alone in the cockpit.  He saw to his business, washed his hands and face, and decided he could pull a double shift instead of numbing himself to sleep.  He stopped, however, in the threshold, when he noticed that the George boy and his cousin were speaking to each other in the soft, quiet language of the Star Sailors.  Quiet, but still translated by his implant for him.
 
""Are you mad at me?"" she was asking.
 
""Oh, yes.  I'm super mad that you pulled a trick on me,"" the Geroge kid scoffed sarcastically.
 
""Oh, I'm sorry.""
 
""Stars, Tran,"" he said as he reached across the console between the pilot's and copilot's seats to gently chuck her chin with his knuckles, ""that was sarcasm.  Of course I'm not mad at you, it was a fine joke.""
 
""Oh, sorry,"" she mumbled again.
 
It seemed to Vincent that the kid forced a deep chuckle, ""You got me good, maybe not as good as you meant to, but to everyone else that's gonna be real funny.""
 
The girl giggled softly before she said, ""I don't know if I can get this thing powered up.""
 
""It's a long shot, but if anyone can do it, you can.  Besides, if it's too wrecked to get anything useful off of, you might be able to use the parts for something else later.""
 
""Aye,"" she said brightly, ""just so long as you…""
 
""Tran, you're good at this kind of thing.  I don't think you can magically fix anything, all we need is for you to try.  If it works, good, if it doesn't, we try something else.""
 
Vincent shrank back into the shadows to give them their privacy.  He could wear himself out in the weight room instead.

Burnout. Parental exhaustion. These aren’t just buzzwords—they’re *biological realities* draining your potential. Over 70% of people battle chronic stress daily, and Harvard researcher Dr. Adia Gooden reveals why: your brain’s survival mode hijacks your ability to thrive. But here’s the *good news*: **your power lies in how you respond**.  

### The Science of Stuckness  
1. **Horizonlessness**: Living in endless ""survival mode"" stifles your ability to plan or feel excitement. Your prefrontal cortex (the ""visionary"" part of your brain) shuts down.  
2. **Loneliness**: 78% of Gen Z and 50% of adults feel disconnected, yet casual conversations (even with strangers!) rewire your brain for connection.  
3. **Parental Stress**: 77% of single parents report burnout, which impacts *future generations*. Prioritizing self-care isn’t selfish—it’s strategic.  

### Reclaim Your Agency (3 Steps)  
1. **Start small**: Look forward to your morning coffee. Take a 5-minute walk. These “micro-wins” rebuild your sense of control.  
2. **Self-compassion is science**: Criticizing yourself? That’s your amygdala on overdrive. Replace guilt with, *“I’m doing better than I think.”*  
3. **Talk to strangers**: The barista, a neighbor, a coworker. Weak-tie interactions reduce loneliness instantly—no deep conversations required.  

### You Are Not Your Stress  
Stress isn’t a moral failing. It’s biology. As Dr. Gooden says: *“Your brain and body aren’t broken. They’re doing exactly what they should.”* By shifting your focus to **small, consistent actions**, you reboot your mindset—and your life.

Whether your a⁣ seasoned outdoorsman or a ⁢weekend ‍warrior, ⁢the ‌right campfire cookware can make all the difference between a ‌culinary triumph and a burnt offering.Choosing the *best campfire cookware* involves considering durability, portability, and cooking performance,‌ all while balancing⁢ your budget and skill level.This‍ guide delves into the top-rated camping‌ cookware sets and individual pieces available,offering reviews and insights​ to help you find the perfect‍ setup for⁣ your⁤ outdoor escapades.

## ⁢Understanding⁣ Your⁤ Campfire Cooking Needs

Before diving into the specifics of campfire cooking⁣ kits, ⁤it's crucial to​ assess your⁣ individual needs and preferences. Are⁢ you primarily ⁣car camping, backpacking, or engaging in a bit of ‌both? How many people are you ⁤typically cooking for? ‌What ⁤kinds of meals ​do you​ envision preparing over the open‍ flame? The answers to these questions ⁣will considerably influence your cookware choices.

As a notable ‍example, ​a solo ⁣backpacker will prioritize lightweight camping cookware, compact size, and versatility. A​ family car camping will lean toward larger, more durable sets.⁣ A campfire cooking kit might include a dutch oven for campfire cooking, a ⁤cast iron skillet campfire, and various pots and pans. Thinking thoughtfully now will‍ guide you toward‌ the best selection.

## Material Matters: Exploring Campfire⁣ Cookware Options

the material of your campfire cookware significantly impacts its performance, durability, and weight. Here's ⁢a breakdown of the‍ most common materials and their pros⁢ and cons:

* ⁢  **Cast Iron:** ⁤The undisputed king of campfire ⁣cooking. Cast iron cookware for‍ camping is known for its remarkable heat retention, even heating, and unmatched durability. Ideal for everything from searing steaks to baking bread in⁣ a ‌dutch oven, cast iron can withstand the rigors of open-fire cooking. However, it's also ‌heavy and⁤ requires proper seasoning and maintenance to⁣ prevent rusting. A cast iron ⁣skillet campfire should be⁣ part of every serious camper's stash of gear.

*‌   **Stainless Steel:** A⁣ popular choice for its durability, resistance to rust, and ease of⁢ cleaning. Stainless steel campfire cookware is lighter than ‌cast ⁤iron and requires⁤ less⁣ maintenance. It heats up⁤ quickly, but it doesn't retain⁣ heat as⁤ well.

*   **Aluminum:** Often found‍ in lightweight camping ‍cookware and ‌backpacking cookware sets, aluminum is extremely lightweight⁤ and efficient at conducting heat. Though, it can be prone ⁤to ⁣warping and denting, and some ‌believe that prolonged ⁢use of untreated aluminum ‍cookware can leach⁤ into food ⁣which raises some‌ health⁤ concerns.⁤ Anodized aluminum⁢ is a more durable and⁤ safer option.

*  ⁤ **Enamelware:** Enamelware campfire sets combine a steel or iron core with a durable enamel coating. These sets are visually appealing,⁢ relatively lightweight, and easy to​ clean. However, the enamel coating can chip or⁤ crack if abused, exposing the⁢ underlying metal to rust.

*   ‌**Carbon Steel:** Carbon steel‍ cookware camping is similar to cast iron but⁢ lighter and smoother. ‌It heats up quickly like stainless steel, but it⁢ requires seasoning to prevent rust,⁣ like cast iron. It's a‍ grate middle-ground for those seeking cast ‍iron performance without the weight.

*   **Material Composition:** As​ discussed above, choose a material ⁣that aligns with your needs and ‌preferences.

* ⁤ ​ **included ‌Utensils:** Some sets come with cooking utensils for campfire use, such as spatulas, spoons,⁣ and tongs. check ⁣if these utensils are durable and heat-resistant.

* ‍  **Cast Iron Skillet:**‍ The workhorse of⁤ campfire cooking, a cast iron skillet campfire is perfect ⁣for searing⁣ meats, frying ⁣eggs, and sautéing vegetables.

*   ​**Campfire Grill/Cooking Grate:** A ⁣campfire grill or campfire cooking grate provides a stable surface for cooking directly‍ over the flames. They come‍ in various sizes and configurations, allowing you to grill everything from burgers to⁢ vegetables. A tripod cooking for campfire setup can be beneficial.

*   **campfire Coffee Pot:** Start your day right with a cup of ⁢joe brewed ⁢over the open fire. A campfire coffee pot should be‌ durable, easy to clean, and designed to pour without spilling.

*   **pie Iron:**⁤ For fun and easy campfire snacks, ‌a pie ⁤iron for camping is another addition to your gear. Simply fill ​it with your favorite ingredients, clamp ⁤it shut, ‌and cook it over the fire until golden⁣ brown.

Now, after testing it again, I noticed that the water sprays out of the portafilter quite aggressively (see video). I then unscrewed the shower screen and saw a lot of black, burnt (?) coffee residues inside. I scraped out about 90% of it and was fairly certain that this would solve the problem. Unfortunately, it is still spraying just as much.

A bit of background about us in case it’s relevant – we enjoy exploring both cities and nature, and sometimes we like to party a bit too :). We prefer active sightseeing over just lying on the beach, but a relaxing beach day now and then also sounds good. We’re traveling as a group of three, and we’re aware that Medellín requires extra caution when it comes to partying (though we’re not planning any Tinder dates, so I hope the scopolamine issue won’t be a concern ;)). So far, the only country we’ve visited in South America is Peru and we absolutely fell in love with it. We are rather experienced with over 40 countries visited around the world, our Spanish is at a B1/B2 level, which we hope, as in Peru, will help with both safety and the overall experience of the trip.

This is what I used:

• Green bowl
• Rice (added green food coloring to it, and salt)
• Salt in the bowl
• Basil
• Chamomile
• Ground cinnamon
• Coffee grounds
• Nutmeg
• Cinnamon sticks
• Bay leaves (with manifestations written on them, plus extra with nothing on them)
• Pyrite
• Citrine
• Tigers eye
• Green aventurine
• Money (4 dollar bills, a $10 bill, and some change)
• Green candle

I rubbed the money with cinnamon sticks and rolled them towards me, then put them in. 

I lit the candle yesterday, and I made some money, like a couple hundred. This morning, I lit the candle and said out loud “I want to make 2 thousand dollars today.” and then snuffed it out after leaving it burning for 10 minutes. 

Got to work, sat at my desk, and started trading. Made $400 in the first 20 minutes. Ended my day an hour and a half in with $1800. I did hit the $2000 ask, but I couldn’t get my sell order filled in time.

1ixzghz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1ixzghz/protecting_your_needs_before_intimacy/,Protecting your needs before intimacy,"Hi all! Long time reader, first time poster :)

I'm a new SB on Seeking. I'm 29 and in a big city. After starting my account, I got a message from a very high net-worth POT, and we started texting then hopped on a quick video call. I was pleasantly surprised to find him attractive, easy to talk to, and nice -- plus he showed me the view from his house, which was pretty spectacular. He lives in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in my city.

We had a M&G coffee over the weekend and it was nice! We didn't talk about Seeking (I hinted it at it early on in the meeting, but he seemed to get a little embarrassed so I gently changed the topic). I get the impression he's also a little new to the site (though I'm not totally sure). We mostly talked about life, travel, politics... it felt like a regular first date.

After coffee we both agreed we'd love to see each other again. Since we hadn't talked about an arrangement in person, I asked over text if I could ask him a few questions I was ""too shy to ask in person."" I asked what he was looking for on the site, and if he had had other arrangements before. He gave me a  vague answer about having recently gotten out of a relationship, and said he ""didn't mind helping out."" I thanked him and told him a true story about how I'd tried Seeking in college, and ended up getting rinsed after a few dates by someone I had liked because we hadn't figured out an arrangement prior to getting intimate. I told him I didn't want that to happen again and he responded ""Ok :)""

Since then, we've been texting a lot, sending saucy pictures, and talking about what we're into sexually. He can't meet this week but we're planning to next week.

So, my question for this lovely subreddit is -- how would you recommend proceeding? Frankly, if we can come to an arrangement organically, I do think it could be in my best interest. I know he has money to spend and I don't want to end up limiting what could happen if I say ""I want XXX amount when we meet."" My preference would be to encourage him to spoil me and see what happens -- but I definitely don't want to get intimate until he's shown he's willing to do that. Also, if we do end up having sexual chemistry, my hope is this can be consistent.

How would you recommend proceeding? He's not a big drinker, but I was thinking I'd push for a cocktail at an upscale bar near his house as our next date. Sex is already very much on the table because of our texts though - and, to be honest, I'm genuinely pretty excited about it - but I just want to make sure I'm being taken care of first.

From about 2015-today there isn't a company or organization in the world that isn't trying to find good people to hire. That means that there is a whole generation of employees that have come of age in an employee's job market where they know that they aren't going to get fired unless they REALLY screw up. This has allowed young employees to really start slacking off and giving their managers shade, because they generally know they can. 

Companies HATE this fact and are generally powerless to do anything about it. They try hard to shame it, calling it ""quite quitting"" or ""coffee clock in"" or something equally dumb.  AI ain't coming fast enough to change the dynamic this decade. 

I believe this is why Musk, and all the rich fools supporting DOGE, are actively trying to start a recession.

1ixzdh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ixzdh7/have_you_ever_played_white_wolf/,Have You Ever Played White Wolf?,"The neighbors taught us the game. Well, I can’t really say neighbors, they lived a full block away from us. But Terry and I were In the same grade at school, and my parents were close with his. The Kenties had ten kids. Most of them were older than us, one was even married with his own kid. My sister and I were sent over to their house every summer, warm weekend, or free day while my parents were at work. This had been the system ever since I turned thirteen. 

One summer, Mom had just started her new training at the hospital, so for a few months, she’d work night shifts for a week or so before switching back. We’d head over after ten, when mom went to bed after her night shift, and then we’d come back by to get the food she’d left us in the fridge for lunch before going back over. It was weird, and she apologized all the time for it, but I’d say we were pretty mature kids all things considered.

Charlotte and I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with them. Sure they were competitive and a little nuts sometimes, but we were too. I’d go as far as saying I grew up part Kentie. I didn’t mind spending hours with them because none of us ever grew tired or bitter with each other. Their house was very welcoming. That and they also had a Playstation. And RipStix. And an untapped imagination when it came to going to the park or fucking around at the splash pad or finding where the plows shoved the parking lot snow into massive peaks of ice.

I remember now how often Terrence Kentie’s imagination should have gotten us killed. Races at breakneck speed down the alleyway connecting our houses together, the time we got chased by a dog and having to jump a fence, barely escaping with our asses, makeshift boat competitions on a quiet lake. All of them had that kid-like reasoning on why it was the greatest idea ever. 

That’s why, when Terry mentioned White Wolf while we were at the park by my house one summer evening, I was surprised he’d never mentioned it before. We’d played every game I’d thought possible in our years of hanging out at the Kenties.

“You’ve never heard of it?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

“We play it all the time!! At my uncle’s camp, it’s like, all the cousins do.”

“Really?”

“Yeah! It’s better in the summertime, when it’s warmer at night.”

The game was to be played at dusk, or while the sun was setting. You didn’t need a lot of people, but the more there were, the better.  

“Basically, you pick a base.” Terry looked around before pointing to one of the old wooden picnic tables. “Like that. Something kind of big, or at least easy to like, see.”

Grace, one of his older sisters a few years older than us, chimed in.

“There’s a stump at Uncle Anthony’s camp. That’s what we use most times.” 

“Yeah, yeah! So, what you do is-”

“You choose someone who’s “it”. They’re the wh-” Carrie, another Kentie sister interrupted.

“Shut up! I’m telling it!”

“Jeez, okay.” 

“Whatever, yeah, they’re the White Wolf. Everyone else hides while they count.”

“We go to like-” Grace started.

“100!” shouted Lewis, the second youngest.

“Or 500 by fives.” 

“It’s the same thiiing.” 

“Stop it!!” Terry hollered. “ANYway, they count and everyone hides. When they’re done, the wolf seeks everyone else. If the wolf gets too close to someone’s hiding spot, the hider ye-”

The other Kentie kids all screamed at the same time, making me and Charlotte jump a little.

“WHITE WOLF!!”

“Guys!! Come ON!!” Terry covered his hands with his eyes. That made us all laugh.

According to Terry, a bit begrudgingly, once someone alerts the others of the wolf, everyone has to run and touch the base, before the wolf gets you. 

“So, if they tag you, are you the next wolf?”

“No. If the wolf gets you, you’re *dead*!” Lewis made a quick slicing motion across his neck to punctuate the severity of this. 

After a few minutes of arguing over how to choose the wolf, Grace picked some of the tall, grassy weeds by the fence. She counted out six, then ripped off the ends to make them even, all except for one. She shuffled them up in her hands and we all picked one. I got the shortest stalk, so I was the wolf. I turned and faced the parking lot of the park, making a show of covering my eyes so no one would accuse me of cheating. 

I counted to 100, and shouted

“Ready or not, here I come!”

I guess it was out of habit, and I felt kind of silly. But when I turned around and saw the silent park, I felt excitement bubble in my chest. Crickets were singing in the baseball field next to me, but even the breeze felt quieter. I took a step forward and looked for a shoe poking out of a slide, or movement by the trees. The gravel ground cover crunched noisily under my feet, but otherwise, I would have been silent. 

I stepped up onto the playground’s first platform, creeping over the tunnels that led to the monkey bars. No one in sight yet. I swung across them, dropping noiselessly onto the next part of the playground. 

Then I saw it. Lewis’s hand on the inside of the next slide. He was bracing himself inside of it, but at the angle I had landed, I could just barely make it out. The dying light wasn’t helping, but my eyes were getting used to it. 

I stood up, slowly. I moved over the short bridge leading to the slide’s entrance like a ninja. 

I peeked over the corner and Lewis’ eyes met mine. 

“WHITE WOLF!” He screamed, sliding down the rest of the slide as my hand swiped in the empty space where he had been seconds ago. 

The park erupted in sound. Carrie dropped from a tree. Terry sprinted out from a porta potty. Grace scooped up Lewis as she ran past him. Charlotte ran out of the dugout. All the movement came so fast I almost forgot what I was supposed to do.

I shot down the slide, in hot pursuit of Carrie, who had been the furthest from the base in her tree. She laughed and jogged easily out of range of my shorter legs. I watched her make it to the table with everyone else, along with time to spare. Flopping to the ground in defeat, I rolled onto my back as we all laughed and gasped for air.

After I had caught my breath, I realized something.

“Hey, I didn’t catch anyone. What happens now?”

Terry sat next to me. “Well, you have to hunt again. Let’s see if you have better luck this time.”

A noise sounded from the direction of my house, causing my sister and I to whip our heads around. It was Dad’s whistle. 

“Darn. Okay! *Next time*, we’ll play this more next time!” I shouted over my shoulder. 



Years passed. We moved away from Kentie after Mom was offered a better position at a bigger hospital a state over. Charlotte and I grew up, graduated, moved out. She went to medical school, like mom. That wasn’t my vibe. I graduated from Boise State University, went to grad school for a few long years, and eventually landed a job at one of the local high schools teaching American History. I met my wife, we got married, I lived.

I had all but forgotten about the Kenties, sans the few times I would recall a funny phrase Lewis said, or a night of secretive gaming with Terry. It wasn’t that I was dismissive of them, as I said, I was basically raised by them. 

However, I was still shocked one morning when I found an email in my inbox from Carrie. I was drinking coffee and burned the roof of my mouth at the familiar name that had popped onto my phone screen. The fright brought Anna to my side and she peered over my shoulder at the message.



*Dear Marcus,*

*I’m so sorry this is out of the blue. I’m sure you hardly remember me.*

*I found your email from your mom’s facebook. It sounds stalker-y, I know. This is a hail mary.* 

*Something is off with Terry. Hell, something’s been off with that son of a bitch for years now.* 

*He’s living off at Uncle Anthony’s old camp after a run in with the law and several bad decisions. I’ve gone up a couple times with Dad and Grace to try and talk some sense into him. Mom can barely cope with the whole thing, and nothing is getting anyone anywhere.* 

*I know it’s a stretch, you’re not a kid anymore, but if you see this, please respond. You’re still considered his closest friend, and if not that, his oldest. You might be the only person he’s willing to listen to right now.* 

*Carolyn Archer*



Anna was convinced it was some sort of scam, but the email had brought all those summers and years of my childhood flooding back, so I told her the whole story. After a lot of convincing, I wrote back to Carrie and we exchanged phone numbers. We called that afternoon and she told me everything. It was nice.

Terry had graduated from JHS with high honors and had landed a full ride at some college a few hours south. He had packed up and started what should have been a successful university experience. Then he met Sean Jameson. Sean visited home with Terry once or twice. 

“He was just, weird.” Carrie said. “All hippie and ‘fuck the system’, which would have been cool if he wasn’t cracked out of his mind. He talked about ‘The Return’ all the time. Had something to do with abandoning society, I think, going back to hunting and gathering.”

The longer Terry hung out with Sean, the less he was Terry-like. He changed. First he grew out his hair, then he started dressing “like a bum” according to Mr. and Mrs. Kentie. He stopped going to church, he stopped going to classes, the bags under his eyes grew deeper and deeper, his grades got worse and worse. He stopped coming home. He lost his scholarship. He was on academic probation, then he was expelled for ‘possession of illicit substances’. Terry was screwed.

“What happened to Sean?” Anna asked.

“Disappeared. Last I heard, Terry mentioned something about South America, or at least, I think he did. He was so fucking bleary and coked out, I couldn’t hear him.” Her voice broke.

Terry? A drug addict? My head was spinning. Flashes filled my mind of a gap toothed, brown haired kid who always had some cut or bruise on him that he’d make me look at, maybe touch. Terry? The kid who climbed the pine tree by the community building to save my sister’s kite? 

How could he have come to this?

Carrie and I finished talking, and hung up. I turned to Anna once the call had ended. She didn’t say anything, but we both knew we were thinking the same thing. I opened my laptop to buy a plane ticket to Wyoming, and she went upstairs to pack a bag for me.

36 hours later, I touched down in Sheridan. Everything was exactly as I remembered, and I felt the rental car turn down city streets with practically no help from me. It was as if my memories sitting in the passenger seat willed it to move. I pulled up in front of the Kentie house around ten. It looked more dim than it appeared in my memory. The crabapple tree by the side door was gone, the one I fell out of and broke my wrist. There were still paint stains on the bricks by the front door where Charlotte and Lewis had “decorated for Easter”. And most importantly, Mrs. Kentie was standing at the front door, waving like I had just pulled up on my bike. 

I was only there for a little bit, and per Carrie’s request, I didn’t explain my reason for being there. I could see weariness in Mr. Kentie’s attitude, and I was afraid of Mrs. Kentie’s reaction if I told her I was there to see her son. So, I lied. I told them that I was “just driving through on my way to Casper”. That didn’t stop them from holding me hostage for an extra hour and filling up my car with muffins and trail mix and what I think was a whole roasted chicken. I remember being shocked that the Kentie kids weren’t 300 pounds the way their mother fed them. It was probably all the running around that kept them in shape. 

When I finally got back on the road and plugged in the address Carrie had given me, I realized I’d be at the camp just before the sun was setting. Good, I wasn’t a fan of driving in the dark. 

The drive there was extremely pleasant. The hills and trees and small towns I passed took me right back to camping trips with my family. We didn’t have a camp, but that didn’t mean Dad didn’t try to get us out and about as much as he could. We’d camp in thick sleeping bags, curled under the stars like brightly colored grubs. We’d catch fish and cook them over the fire, hike, and swim. I loved it all. 

Was Terry alright? Maybe he was detoxing. That would make him irritable, right? Carrie had been cryptic in her explanation of his attitude when she tried to talk to him. The way she described it, I worried I’d come in contact with some nonverbal, hairy, bigfoot-type Terry. But if his bad example wasn’t around anymore and he was realizing the error of his ways, stubborn Terry was absolutely the kind of guy to distance himself completely and reflect. Maybe the mountain air and game was already finishing the job. Maybe when I took this corner up the road, I’d turn onto the driveway and see Terry reading National Geographic in a hammock. 

The car crunched up the lip of the road and pulled into the drive. The camp wasn’t humble. A two story log-cabin style structure surrounded by grass, with an open garage on the side. I could see canoes lining the walls and a kayak under a tarp, along with Terry’s Honda. It looked horrible, covered in mud and bird shit, the grass growing through the gaps in the tires. 

On the other side of the yard, I saw a woodshed, like a one story, condensed version of the house. There was sound coming from behind it, someone chopping wood. I turned the car off, stepping out and slamming the door.

“Terry?” I called, tentatively.

I immediately tensed. What if I was completely wrong? I was alone in the woods with a convict, who was probably on something. And I was breezing onto his property? While he had an axe? Genius.

I thought about jumping into my car and leaving, but before I could turn around, a head popped around the corner of the shed.

“Hey!”

A shirtless, bearded man with long hair pulled back walked out from behind the structure. The way he walked cemented my knowledge that it was still Terry, and I realized, though it had been years since I saw him, since I *spoke* with him, he was still my best friend. He walked across the space separating us until he was a few feet away from me.

“Ya lost, friend?”

He was still holding the ax. I cleared my throat.

“Hey, Terry. It’s me, Marcu-” his face changed in a split second.

“Jesus Christ!” I was suddenly yanked into a bone-crushing hug, the thud of the axe against the ground making my heart slow down a little bit. Terry smelled like sweat and woodsmoke. “Oh my god, you’re really here!”

He held me at arms length, presumably so he could get a solid look at me. His voice was deeper than I had expected. As he had gotten closer, I saw how strong he had gotten. Terry was a couple inches shorter than me as a kid, something I bullied him about relentlessly. Now, he was my height, and broader than I was. This time in the wilderness had changed him. I could feel his vice-like grip on my arms, firm and with an edge of control.

This was not the man I expected to find. I was ready to fight an emaciated concept of what used to be my best friend, or carry out his body, worst case scenario.Terry looked better than I ever thought I’d see him. A great big smile, the same laugh, just pitched down now, and a kind heart. 

“Come on in! You hungry? I caught some trout earlier that I was going to fry up, and I think we have some raspberries still. If not, we can head out tomorrow and get them ourselves.”

It was the best dinner I’d eaten in, well, ever. They say hunger was the best sauce, and, yeah, I was pretty hungry, but my company made it even better. Terry told me about the woods, his woods. He told me about a river that cut through the mountain, where he collected water for drinking and showering. He was almost done fitting the house for a well, but didn’t talk too much about it. He told me about the bobcat that had roamed through a month ago, and how he had a family of cardinals living in the eves of the woodshed.

Terry went to the fridge, grabbing two beers, and we sat out on the porch, watching the stars come out. From our seats, I could see the stump, the one I knew immediately the Kentie kids had used as their White Wolf base, years and years ago. 

My reason for being there came back to me then. I turned to look at Terry. A quintessential mountain man, sipping a beer, shirtless in the summer breeze. I almost wanted to stay quiet, hang out with him a few more days and then leave him to live up here. He seemed happy enough.

“Did Dad send you?”

It was a simple question, yet I felt my stomach drop like he was chastising me.

“No.”

“Mom?”

“Carrie.” 

He nodded, his jaw set. I watched him for a moment before continuing. 

“They’re just worried about you, you know? I don’t know a lot, and I’m sorry I wasn’t in touch for so long. Maybe if I had called you sooner, things would have been different.”“I don’t know if they would have.”“What do you mean?”

“Marcus, I know I did some stupid shit, and I know there’s a chance that Mom and Dad aren’t going to be happy even if I did come back. The choices I made have consequences. And I know that. But look around us! Look at me! I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in years. Yeah, Sean wasn’t the greatest compatriot, but he taught me what I needed to know. I’m a better man for it. Even if, even if you never moved away, I have a feeling I would have been led to this place some way or another.”

“This place?” Terry turned in his seat so he could look at me head on. “Mom and Dad thought Sean was some sort of nutso, feel-good, hippie freak. They weren’t wrong, but they weren’t exactly right either. Sean told me about all this, the trees, nature, the growing world around us. Do you really think humans are going to win in the end?”I realized after a second that the question wasn’t rhetorical.

“Uhh, well, no. When we’re gone, I doubt we’ll be able to leave a mark that we were ever here.”Terry slapped the arm of his chair, laughing. “Exactly! See? You get it! All this is temporary. Grass still grows through pavement, bumps in sidewalks shape from roots of trees, roads wash out in floods, it will all go back to Mother Nature.”

I remembered something Carrie had said. “It will all… return?”

“And so will we.” Terry looked at the sky again. “Sean knew that, and he knew he wasn’t going to wait around for it to happen. He cut out the middleman.”The conversation, I realized, had taken a darker turn than I wanted it to. “What- what did Sean do?”

Terry finished his drink and placed the empty bottle on the ground with a muted *ca-clink.* 

“What would you do if you knew you could control your death?”

I blinked. “What?”

“Sean found a way to control his end, even extend his time on this plane of existence. He told me how to do it too. I’ve separated from society, probably further than he had. I’m in better shape than he ever was, apart from when I was still at school. I cracked the code. The more open your mind is, the easier it is to return, but…” he held up his arm, slowly flexing the muscles. “...the more ready your mortal body is, the more control you’ll have once you’ve returned.”I couldn’t believe any of this. But I needed to assess the situation. Terry wasn’t on anything, and one bottle of Bud Lite was nowhere near enough to get someone talking like this. Maybe I could contact the police, or a suicide helpline, or something to get Terry out of the woods by himself. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I nearly missed Terry standing up.

When I looked up, he was by the stump in the back. I watched him run his hand along the side of it. 

“Marcus?”“Yeah, Terry?”“You don’t have to say yes. You can laugh and go to bed, or drive off, or whatever you want.”“What’s up, man?”He straightened up and turned to me.

“Will you play White Wolf with me again? Just, you know, one more time.”

We flipped a coin to see who was it. When Terry turned to count, I sprinted off towards the house, making a lot of noise on the gravel driveway before creeping back around the house to throw him off my scent. It was as if I was in middle school again, out late because our parents hadn't called us to come in yet, playing games that had higher stakes than needed. 

One thing I didn’t mention about White Wolf is the hiding strategy. You want a good hiding spot, but it also needs to be one you can evacuate from quickly if the wolf gets too close. My favorite places were trees with big branches, closed-topped slides, and fallen logs, places you could scope out the wolf. I wasn’t going into the woods, but that didn’t leave many good spots for a grown man. I snapped my head around, looking for spaces I could use. My eyes landed on the woodshed and its odd roof. 

The roof of the shed didn’t completely connect with the walls. I could hear Terry in the distance, somewhere in the fifties already. I didn’t have a lot of time left. 

The door was locked, its key on a hook in Terry’s kitchen. I knew he wouldn’t look inside. I chose to scale the wall, using the edge of the opposite walls as hand and footholds. Pulling myself onto the top of the wall, I eased my legs through the gap until I was balancing on my stomach, holding the sides of the roof and walls to brace myself. Blindly, I tried to find a foothold. There was what seemed to be a stack of uncut logs in one corner, or buckets, or something. Whatever they were, I had a place to put my left foot and still be able to see out the top. 

When we had started, I had worried that it was going to be too dark. Would he be able to see me? But now that my eyes had adjusted, I knew he’d be fine. The moon was pretty full, and the light from the house reached a little farther than I had expected. I was still facing the woods, but there was space to jump out and get away if Terry got close. 

I know. No one else was there to shout “White Wolf!” to. If I was caught, the game was over. I wasn’t doing this to please myself. I was doing it for my best friend. 

Terry had stopped counting. I held my breath, trying to listen for the gravel sounds. He would probably look in the garage, maybe even in the parked cars. 

Instead, I heard the soft swish of grass moving. Heavy steps getting closer. And, ragged breathing? If Terry was trying to freak me out, it was working. I sunk lower behind the wall, putting more weight on my left leg. I got low enough that I could just hardly see over the edge of the wall.

There he was. He came into view behind the shed, looking over his shoulder and around the yard and house behind him. He was holding his chest, like he’d just run a mile, and his muscles were twitching and jerking beneath his skin.

What happened next is nothing that I can explain. It all took place within a minute, and yet I felt like I sat in the shed watching for hours. Terry fell to his knees, wheezing and gasping. The way air was expelled from his lungs more than it was taken in made my chest ache. He coughed and sputtered over the moonlit grass, and I watched the flecks of spit turn into gobs of foam. The sounds coming from Terry’s throat were grating, and I was shocked the effort of coughing and breathing hadn’t torn anything. I opened my mouth, a “You alright?” ready on the tip of my tongue. 

Terry’s right shoulder shot down and back as his spine pushed up and forward, punctuated with a wet crack. He yelled, still coughing, as the other shoulder followed suit. The skin on his back bruised and stretched with the new bone placement. My jaw dropped, anything I could think to say gone completely from my mind. 

Terry’s arm had dropped from his chest, and he crouched down on the ground, still coughing. It was mixed with something else now. The coughs had inflections, rhythmic, yet random. His face flitted towards the house again and I caught the look in his eye. I had only seen it once before, when we had snuck into the yard of a house on my block. The house with a dog hiding under the porch that had leapt out, snapping at us, breaking off its leash. The look in Terry’s eyes right now matched the ones I saw when I stopped at the fence to boost him over: raw terror. 

He was still coughing, but it was labored, wheezy. He pushed himself weakly on to all fours, gasping. The rippling movement under his skin was back, and moving towards his neck. 

With no warning, Terry’s arms snapped forward with sick cracks. He screamed, watching the bones grind against themselves and contort his tendons, pulling his fingers back at odd angles. He was openly crying now, wet sobs punctuated by cries of pain. He looked like he was trying to stand up, holding most of his weight on his legs with the little strength he had left. 

My ears were ringing, all staticy. It felt like nothing around me was making any sound, and yet I could hear the hair on Terry’s body moving in the wind. I was both dead to the world and hyper-aware of everything taking place before me. I tried to yell, or cry, or do something to help my best friend, but my body wouldn’t do what my brain was screaming at it to do.

Crunch. Another bloodcurdling scream. Terry’s knee had shot backwards, popping out of socket and bringing the rest of the leg with it, skewing into a leg fastened the wrong way. He still had his jeans on, and in a frenzy of movement, he tore at them with hideous, destroyed arms and nails. I don’t know if his hip had dislocated as well, but his thigh seemed shorter. The bones he had were breaking and contorting, leaving the skin on Terry’s body to fold and bunch in unnatural ways. 

The other leg followed suit, and at the same time, Terry’s feet began to extend, stretching and popping as what once were his heels grew longer and longer. He never stopped crying. 

It was awful. At first it was condensed, like he was trying to man up and just “get through” his own body mauling itself. But as the seconds ticked by, the groans became screams, which became shrieks, which became pitiful begs. He called for his mom at one point, tugging at his hair and clumps of grass with shriveled, bruised hands. He cried for his dad, for his siblings, for God, for the devil. He bubbled out threats, then promises, then pleas, all while the remainder of his original body bastardized itself. 

I think we both vomited at the same time. I know I did, and when I looked back up at what once was my friend, he had his eyes fixed on me. I prayed he’d think I was a vision, or a trick of the light. 

“M-marcus…” 

His eyes were bloodshot, his nose was bleeding, and he was staring right at me. Gritting his broken teeth, he forced what was once his muscled arm up towards me. It was a thirteen year old Terry reaching to climb back over the fence.

And we both knew he couldn’t outrun the dog this time. 

His hand dropped to the ground, the visceral tears and grating of the rest of his body echoing in the silent space as he did. His other front limb, I couldn’t even call them arms anymore, followed it, grabbing the ground as he tried to claw towards me. His back extended, and I heard his backbone dislocate and split, each vertebrae like a gunshot. Where his pelvis was, a lump was forming, the skin bruising like his back had, and how his limbs were.

“Marc-cus, please…”

My mouth was bone dry. My hands gripped the wall so hard I could feel splinters needling their way into my hands. Bile dripped from my lips and stained my shirt. 

“....help...me…”

I wanted to stop it. I wanted to climb over this fucking wall and grab him and *fix* him. I wanted to go back to that night at the park and *not* play. I wanted to go to college with him. I wanted to kill Sean. I wanted to kill *Terry*. What would be the mercy? What would bring the end? 

“Terry…” my voice wasn’t my own. It was the one I used after breaking my wrist. I sounded like a scared boy again, desperate for everything around me to be some fucked up dream. 

“MaaaAARR-” his head tilted up and back. Too far. The vertebrae popped. His skull caved above his forehead. There was something wrong with the front of his throat. I thought it was his windpipe forcing its way up his larynx. The skin strained and split and I saw…

Black? Something black and shiny was forcing its way out of Terry. It glistened oily in the pale light, and more was appearing by the second. Terry’s face had collapsed, his eyes were dark, and yet by some horrible mystery, he was continuing to scream. The lines of red, hot tears were like scars on his deflated face, and the thing was getting bigger on his throat. It was...what the fuck was that? I saw a snout, and jaws, sharp, white canines, like a mockery of Terry’s broken teeth that I could still see through his slack, blood coated lips. There was a crust of yellow white on the nose of whatever was in him, a sick smell I registered even this far from him. Like a broken egg, or an embryonic sac. 

The flap of skin that was once my friend’s face finally dropped, flattened by the lack of mass within it. It flopped sickeningly against his shoulders, the long hair coming loose from its tie and sticking to his sweat-sheened skin. 

Terry’s final cry echoed around me. It was bouncing off the trees, free in the air, and swirling around in the shed with me. But the skin covered lie of an animal lay quiet on the ground, quivering like a newborn deer. 

I must have stared at it for an hour. Then it twitched, and I saw its head come up. It’s eyes met mine.

There was not a trace of the man I once knew in them. The eyes in that face were an animal’s, deep and dark. It got up, hind legs first. There wasn’t any wobble or uncertainty. Seeing the mangled human body move like that made my stomach turn again. The lump once at the base of his back had produced a sickly looking tail, and every inch of the thing’s body was covered in a fine layer of hair. 

The fuzz caused it to have a haze of light around it. I watched its glowing shape turn from me and trot away from me. The thing had made it to the edge of the woods.

Before it disappeared into the dark, it looked back at me, and just as it melted into the deep black of the trees, I heard myself speak.

“White Wolf.”

I said it in a whisper, my throat raw and high. 

I stayed in the shed for hours. I stayed until I had cried myself into eyes swollen and stomach completely empty. I stayed until the sun rose. Only when I could see that I was completely alone, I climbed out of the shed.

I have been driving since. I know I’ll need to stop and find somewhere to return this rental. Hell, maybe I’ll fucking buy it to get home. I just need to get a different plane ticket. Right now, it feels better to drive. I’ve stopped just outside of Denver, and I’m sitting in a gas station writing this. I don’t know what the point of it is, now that I have to consider the words I’ve written. I was writing this as, I don’t even know, a report to the police? What would they do? Would they even believe me? Do I send this to Carrie? Would *she* even believe me?

Maybe if someone finds this, someone more qualified, they can help me. I need to know more. If you know a man by the name of Sean Jameson, please contact me. If you know anything *about* him, please contact me. I need to know what happened to Terrence Kentie. Was it the game that destroyed him? Was it the company he kept? Was it something more than him, more than me, more than humanity itself? 

Whatever it was, keep yourself safe. I have seen what happened to those who were careless with their lives. 

I have seen the White Wolf.

I’m currently in Ethiopia and exploring potential opportunities in the coffee business. As I dive deeper into understanding the industry, I’d love to connect with farmers, exporters, or anyone experienced in Ethiopian coffee production and trade.

I’m particularly interested in learning about:
	•	The process of coffee farming and harvesting
	•	Export regulations and logistics
	•	Challenges and opportunities in the industry
	•	How the international market interacts with Ethiopian coffee

If you or someone you know is involved in the coffee business, I’d love to have a conversation and gain some insights. Feel free to comment or DM me, and we can set up a time to talk.

1ixzaz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ixzaz6/needing_help/,Needing help,"I am the youngest of 5 and my older siblings despise me.  I’ve always felt different from them.  Never quite fit in.    I’m the one w/ crooked teeth, acne, scars from acne, just a hot mess, but i managed to stay positive and had a bunch of friends.  Friends who also witnessed the toxic dynamics of my family and tried desperately to save me from them, but I never listened and only delved deeper into the toxic abyss.  My older brother and sister were the worst.  The brother hurt me and scarred me by kicking me in my face, talking me into doing extremely dangerous things at 3-4 yrs old which resulted in brain damage.  One example is when he told me I could easily hop down my porch concrete steps with my hippity hop.  He let me lay there unconscious until my mom found me.  I woke up on the couch and have a dent in my forehead from it.  My memory and my temper were affected.  No er trip that time since I was just there from his prior incident of him kicking me in my mouth making me but my tongue all the way through…got the scar from that one, too.  There was also the time he threw me off the couch and into a homemade coffee table made from 4x4s.  Hit the side of my mouth so hard that it killed my front baby tooth and shifted my adult teeth on the left, so when they finally came, they were crooked and still are.  Looks like I was clobbered from the left…which is kinda what happened.  Once I got bigger, and started fighting back, he cooled down…only to get me while I was sleeping.  He began molesting me once I turned 12-13.  At first, i didn’t know what was going on because he’d do it while I was sleeping.  Eventually I started waking up to him and he’d immediately leave the room and I’d lay there just crying.  I didn’t know what to do or who to turn to bc my mom was so up my step dad’s ass, who also hated me, I had literally nobody to turn to.  Not to mention that when this happened to my sister by my mom’s boyfriend, she blamed her for what she wore to bed that night, so i didn’t think she’d believe me.  I tried locking my door, but mom wouldn’t allow me to do that since I was caught sneaking out to my neighbors house before.  I tried sleeping in the living room in hopes he wouldn’t try to touch me there for fear of getting caught, but he did it anyway.  My stepdad once came in there when he was knelt down beside me on the couch and I woke up to my stepdad asking him what he was doing and he needed to go back to bed.  I think he knew what my brother was trying to do but didn’t give af bc my stepdad hated me.  I would wrap myself up in a sheet or blanket like a burrito to make it harder for him to get to me that way I’d wake up which made him stop.  I would wear full bodysuits to bed and sleep on my stomach (I thought he couldn’t get to my vagina from the back, that’s how young and naive I was) That didn’t work bc instead of my vagina, he started fondling my anus.  One night I finally woke up entirely while he was actually fondling me and I looked at him dead in his eyes and shouted “what the hell are you doing??!!”  And he literally crawled away on all fours, cowering like a gd animal.  He said nothing back to me and closed his door.  He never touched me again.  That pos used me up like I wasn’t even a human being.  And my other siblings had the audacity to try and excuse his behavior.  Chocking it off on some past traumas he endured.  Those traumas were exactly why I never told on him.  His life was messed up enough.  I knew nothing good would come of it.  I kept it to myself for decades.  My mom would bring him everywhere (bc he was a weirdo uncle Pete who lived w/his mama all his adult life) and I had to just tolerate it.  It wasn’t until he started grooming my youngest niece when I finally told someone, which was her mom, my oldest sister.  I always believed he did that to me bc of the fckd up situation we were living in.  We were poverty stricken and my stepdad was a crackhead and my mom was his enabler.  There was a fight or some desperate situation happening every other weekend. Mom was weak when it came to that man, which made the whole house weak and scared.  But it wasn’t that.  It wasn’t just with me.  He truly is a pedophile.  I learned that they start young and usually with a family member.  Needless to say, my oldest didn’t believe me entirely and continued to allow him around my niece.  And my older sister? Pffft.  She hated me from the moment I was born.  Maybe they all did bc I didn’t arrive at a good time.  I was unexpected and mom was completely unprepared.  Just another mouth to feed is what I was viewed as.  A problem.  An extra that wasn’t needed, and boy was I treated that way.  I had to wear her hand me downs and she’d make sure they were ruined or lost before she had to give them to me.  Once, we were sharing a shirt bc she could still fit it, and that made it still her’s, she got mad at me right before we had to go to school and made me take that shirt off and wear a dirty shirt with holes in it.  Mom didn’t do anything about it.  I was in 6th grade.  Luckily, my friends took pity on me and had an extra pe shirt in their locker they let me borrow.  It gave my sister sheer joy to see me struggle.  It was more emotional than physical with my sister.  Anyway, stepdad divorced mom, and finally got our mom back, and all was well for about 10 years.  I had my own apartment raising my daughter.  My entire family, mom and all siblings w/ their kiddos, would visit three times a week for coffee.  It was nice and somewhat normal.  I was happy to have the family together again, no matter how twisted it was before.  But sadly, mom passed, then all that ugly behavior began rearing its ugly head again.  My brother confessed his unyielding love to both of my nieces.  Told them that he was in love with them and asked them if they ever felt the same way? Fortunately, that’s as far as that went and now he is estranged from everyone but the other fckd up sister, the older one.  Then, out of the blue, that same older sister accused me of sleeping with her husband of 30+years solely because we were cordial with one another.  No rhyme or reason .  Just came up with it one weekend during a fight I suppose.  Or it may have been the other sister and her just talking shit on me and coming up with unrealistic scenarios seeing that I am single and independent.  They just cannot fathom someone being this comfortable with themselves without something they are hiding.  She is also an EXTREMELY jealous and abusive person (yes, a woman can be just as physically and emotionally abusive as a man and my older sister proves it).  Needless to say, we quit having coffee every week, that i managed to continue having even though Mom had passed away.  Then, I found out that my oldEST sister was preparing a relationship for me and my old my best friend who got weirdly obsessed with me.  He began acting very different towards me.  Quite cold and distant.  I found out that it was bc my oldest sister told him to cut ties with me so I would miss him and eventually want to have a relationship with him. Told me that I would learn to love him and be sexually attracted to him.  It was very creepy and deceitful.  So I started slowly distancing myself from them, and they noticed and tried everything in the book to get me to bend, but it wasn’t going to happen.  Then one night I got a knock on my door from the police to inform me that our biological father had passed.  Instead of getting together and embracing what family we had left, they got jealous that the police came to my house and not theirs.  They started lying and omitting information from me.  They sneaked behind my back and got a lawyer.  The older sister became the administrator and tried to not include a 20k savings account thst i happened to discover the last day i was on his property.  When I presented it to her lawyer, she texted me later to inform me of her utter and pure hatred of me..which answered my question entirely.  They tried to divy his property up like candy.  Giving it to their boyfriends or for their own selfish benefit.  I had to put my foot down on more than occasion in order for those pieces of sh!t to respect our father’s things.  Finally got my own attorney at no charge to me which got the ball really rolling.  I assumed my sister was trying to milk his accounts as much as possible before having to split it up.  My father’s death is what ultimately ended our relationships all together and I’m not sad about it.  That’s the thing I need help with.  I have no want to talk to any of them ever again.  There’s so much more they have done to me and only me, and the only ones who are apologizing are the bystanders who did absolutely nothing to help but are now dealing with similar things and empathize with me…a little too late in my opinion.  But, shouldn’t i at least be a little sad?  All i feel is anger.  ",1,1740501548.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False
1ixza5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1ixza5p/aquinas_first_way_has_a_fundamental_internal/,Aquinas First Way Has a Fundamental Internal Problem,"
Formulation of the First Way:

1. Some things are in motion. 
2. Everything in motion must have been put into  motion by something else. 
3. This chain of movers and moved is a hierarchical rather than an accidental series. 
4. Every hierarchical series must have a primary member; in this case something which moves others but is not moved itself. 
5. Therefore there must be at least one unmoved mover. 
6.Therefore there must be at least one unmoveable mover.


This is the outer shell of the argument:

1. Some things are reducing from potentially existing to actually existing.
2. Everything that is reducing from potentially existing to actually existing is so by something else, which it also is either reducing to potentially existing to actually existing or not.
3. This chain of movers and moved is hierarchical rather than accidental.
4. Every hierarchical series must have a have a primary member(otherwise there would be no source of existence for the last member).
5. Therefore there must a primary mover that is not reducing from potentially existing to actually existing at the moment it actualizes the existence of the whole chain.
6. Therefore there is at least one purely actual actualizer.


The thomistic justification for the first premise is the following: if a substance A could have been different from what is currently is, i.e., if a substance A has the potential to be other than what actually is, then there must be an explanation as to why it is actually A right now and not something else. More precisely, there must be some explanation as to why the object A persists in actuality as it is. Something that brought it about explains how it came to to be here, but it does not explain why It persists at the moment it is brought into existence by a temporally prior cause. So there must be an explanation as to why it remains actually A and not something else that it could be. This means, for the thomist, that A is concurrently being reduced from potentially A to actually A to at every moment in which it exists.

The second premise follows the principle that nothing can actualize itself, so there must be something external, let's say B, that actualizes A's potentiality for existence. Now, B itself, at the moment it actualizes A's potentiality for existence, is either concurrently being reduced from potentially existing to actually existing.

The third premise is of great importance, because there is a difference between accidental and hierarchical chains. An accidental chain could be infinite in principle(according to Aquinas), but an hierarchical chain, in which causation occurs simultaneously, could not.

The fourth premise states that there must be a primary member, otherwise there would be no source of existence. Let's say A's potential for existence is actualized by B, which B's potentiality for existence is actualized by C in turn and so ad infinitum. Now since this is an hierarchical chain, the causation occurs simultaneously. So, if there is no first member that actualizes the chain, then there is no source of actuality at all; for every member in this infinite chain exists only potentially, but none of them has actuality in themselves. 

The fifth premise follows from the fourth. There must be at least one  primary member that is not reducing from potentially existing to actually existing; it is just actually in respect to its existence at the moment it actualizes the rest of the chain.

The sixth premise states that if there is at least one unactualized actualizer, then there is at least one Purely Actual Actualizer(which later on thomists would argue that there can be only one Purely Actual Actualizer; of course, if there is a Purely Actual Actualizer depends on the success of the argument).

#Dialectical Shift


We need not appeal to the *existential inertia thesis*(although we could) to demonstrate how the first premise of the argument is false. The concepts of act and potency requires what I would call *dialectical shift* in order to work inasmuch as it presupposes that potency is reduced to act but that, at the time,  that which is now act is in potency in *relation* to its previous actuality(which is now potential) and other potentialities. To illustrate this imagine a cup of hot coffee on a table. Now, the coffee has the potential to become cold which is actualized by the ambient temperature. Since the coffee was actualized by the ambient temperature then it is actually cold right now; however, because it is actually cold right then it is potentially hot again(when it is cold it is potentially hot, when it is hot it is potentially cold). It loses its actuality of *‘hotness’* in order to gain another actuality *‘coldness’*, but inasmuch as it becomes actually cold it becomes at the same time potentially hot; and this applies to the ambient temperature itself, which can only actualize the coffee's potentiality for coldness if itself is going through this dialectical shift in itself(I.e., transitioning from degrees of temperature).

So this is the dialectical shift, which is pretty much presupposed in the aristotelian concepts of act and potency, otherwise motion could not be explained. In fact, motion is exactly this dialectical shift.

Because there is a dialectical shift in every reduction from potency to act, then the same principle can be applied to the broader idea of something in motion in respect to its substantial existence. Let's take A again, for example. Because A is concurrently reducing from potency to act by the actualizer B, then, as with the coffee,  there must be some dialectical shift happening in which something actual is becoming potential in some respect while becoming actual in another(towards A). Since the actualizer of A is B, then B must be shifting from actuality to potentiality(losing ‘B-ness’) at the same time that it is shifting from potentiality to actuality(gaining ‘A-ness’). But then we would have to presuppose another thing C that actualizes B's potentiality for A-ness, and so we would repeat the same process ad infinitum. Because motion always presupposes this dialectical shift, then existential motion suffers from the same problem of infinite regress. The only way out of this is either to abandon existential motion(deny the first premise) or simply assume that the actualization of A’s potentiality for existence is not about motion at all. But at this point the only candidate is creation ex nihilo which the argument has no way to prove without begging the question. And if B actualizes A without undergoing a dialectical shift, then we can just as well assume that A's existence itself is not going through a dialectical shift and so there is no need to postulate B. That is to say, after A is brought into existence by some temporally prior cause there is no need for an external sustaining cause for after A exists A's existence is not dialectically shifting from potential existence to actual existence at every moment in which it exists(and so we would have the regress again). 

#An Objection 

Some theists might argue that only beings which are an *admixture of act and potency* are reducing from potentially existing to actually existing at every moment. But even the wording here: *‘admixture of act and potency’* presupposes beings in a state of actuality in one respect, but in potency in another. More to the point, if everything that is not Purely Actual requires a causal sustainer of its own existence, then anything which is not Purely Actual is just pure potentiality. Needless to say that this is problematic. If God concurrently actualizes A, but A is Pure Potentiality without the constant causal act of God, then God, as it were, actualizes pure potentiality into actuality at every moment in which it exists. But then that would mean that Pure Actuality coe-exists with Pure Potentiality and gives potentiality actuality. But this is absurd, Aquinas himself said potentiality only exists in relation to actuality; potentiality cannot exist isolated from actuality. We can even run an argument with this affirmation:

1. No potential exists isolated from actuality.
2. So any potentiality exists in relation to actuality.
3. Therefore, a potentiality for existence is related(inheres) something already actual.

Again, It seems to me that the only way to avoid an infinite regress in a hierarchical series of causes is to postulate creation ex nihilo or to simply deny that there is such a thing as existential motion at all. Obviously the former cannot be proven without begging the question or falling into contradiction(per inseparability of potency from act); and obviously the atheist will deny existential motion as the best alternative.

1ixz8qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1ixz8qd/is_there_any_way_to_lengthen_time_between_autoplay/,Is there any way to lengthen time between autoplay?,"99.9% sure the answer to this is no, but I'm going to ask anyway. 

I know some time ago Youtube changed their settings to autoplay after a much shorter time, and like I have seen a good handful people agree with its INCREDIBLY annoying. I've looked through the settings and have researched online to see if anyone else had found something for this, but I didn't really find much of anything so I'm making a post and asking myself.

The autoplay length currently is set at (I BELIEVE) 3 seconds (I'm not even sure because I don't even have enough time to look up at my screen before the next video starts). This leaves me no time to get to my computer and click the cancel option if I didn't want it to autoplay. 

I know people will respond to this with ""just turn off autoplay"", but 99% of the time I am watching videos in the background while doing other things. My laptop is on my coffee table and I am sitting on the couch, so even IF I was paying full attention to the video, I still couldn't reach over and maneuver the mouse in 3 seconds anyway. But I do need the autoplay, because it would be MUCH more annoying to have to manually reach over and click on videos every 10-30 minutes.

Honestly in most cases it normally isn't the biggest problem if I don't really care about what I'm watching. I'll put on some commentary channel or some gaming youtuber and just let whatever random videos autoplay. But recently I've been watching multi-part series, and youtube's algorithm LOVES to autoplay literally any other video except the next part in the series, even when it's listed at the top of the Watch Next list (which idk why it doesn't just play what's at the top, thats also incredibly annoying but thats not the point). These videos aren't in a playlist, and I'm not going to make a million playlists that just have 3 videos in them for one series I'm watching. 

Anyway, I guess there are a few things I'm asking. A. if there's a setting I missed somewhere that is able to change the length before autoplay, B. if there's something external like an extension or a plugin I could use to lengthen it instead (I use Firefox), and C. if there isnt, then is there any possibility that youtube would add something like that in the future. Again, I'm pretty sure the answer to all of these is going to be a no and that I'm just gonna have to suck it up and deal with it, but it doesn't hurt for me to ask. 

The only reasoning I could think of for youtube to shorten the length to only 3 seconds would be because some people get annoyed if there's a long period of silence in between videos, but that also seems like such a non-issue to me. I don't know why some of these companies are so against site personalization, because it would be so easy to add something in settings where you could adjust the length and make EVERYONE happy (even if it was a dropdown menu of pre-set times, having an option between like 3s 5s or 10s would be so easy to implement and so beneficial for the people that do have a problem with it).

A friend canceled last minute on me because she „isn’t feeling well“, we were supposed to go for a drink and dinner. I feel stupid because I had a gut feeling that she would ditch me because she often does and I still went ahead and made a reservation and looked forward to today. 

I am a single female, no boyfriend, I grew up in an emotionally distant family as the typical black sheep and they also just sent a short WhatsApp this morning. I have a few friends but they have people in their lives that are more important to them so I‘m spending this birthday alone. I will order food and watch Netflix.

Usually I am ok with being lonely but today it really gets to me. I mourn the hopeful version of me who thought she‘ll find true love. It hurts me that my sister throws friends birthday parties and I don’t even get a call. I didn’t get any gifts or calls, just a few texts. I went outside for a little walk, bought myself coffee and a face serum, went into a store to try some perfume just so somebody would have a little chat with me. I did laundry and cleaned my bathroom. My eyes are puffy from crying.

I don’t understand why I am not important to someone. Why guys fall in love with me but never want to be with me. Why there’s never someone who thinks „hey, it’s her special day, I would love to do something with her“. Work is not going well either so I am worried about the future too

I previously went to a dentist in manhattan and decided to find someone locally. I have been going to a local dentist in sunnyside for a few years now and have no issue with the dentist until my very recent visit. She did a very aggressive cleaning on my teeth. For some context, before this visit i have been very careful with my dental routine: floss and rinse after every meal, brush 2x a day, no drinking tea and coffee etc. I have no tart but definitely have some stains on my teeth. She used the airspray with baking soda, which i know it is a normal procedure and it was applied on my almost in every single dental cleaning. But she used very aggressively and when i asked for a break during the middle of the cleaning (which i never had to do that before), she refused and continue with the airspray with no very little water flow but strong air flow with baking soda. She had to stop finally because she accidentally dropped the airspry on the floor and she cant continue. The saliva ejector was casually placed in my month and kept rubbing my skin. after the cleaning, my entire month was so salty inside out and got winkled and bleeding because of the baking soda rubbing my entire gum and month in very high speed and long time. I told the dentist how i felt, and she insisted that was necessary because of the stain. I know this is prob nothing abnormal but i have been going to dental cleaning regularly 2x a year and this was the first time i felt so painful (i know what a regular cleaning feels like and this time was not the same) After i got home, my gum are still in pain and breeding til next few days - this has never happened to me before.

The cigar was gifted by a fellow BOTL who took pity on this old soul and for that I thank him directly! He knows who he is!

The cigar to me is mild to a soft medium because I generally smoke full bodied cigar with my signature smoke being an Oliva Serie V Double Toro Maduro to give you an idea of my 25 years of experience. It has a great aroma, constructed very well with no draw issues. I have a clean palette and there is just a touch of sweetness, a slight pepperiness on the front of the tongue but it goes away almost immediately after every draw. I could definitely recommend this cigar to someone who is fairly new with some experience as long as they took their time because I can see where it could overwhelm someone very quickly. Lots of smoke and it didn't really burn hot at all stayed even with a very strong white ash!

A review you can trust,"Testing out the JBL Vibe Buds for the past few weeks has been an engaging experience. These wireless earbuds caught my attention with their promise of JBL Deep Bass Sound, Smart Ambient technology, and an impressive 32-hour combined battery life. As someone who wears earbuds throughout the day—whether during work calls, workouts, or quiet downtime—I found plenty to like, but a few quirks also stood out.

**Design & Build Quality**

The compact, sleek design of these earbuds immediately impressed me. They feel lightweight yet sturdy, and the matte finish adds a touch of sophistication. The earbuds come with three sizes of ear tips, so I was able to find the perfect fit for my ears. The charging case, however, left me wishing for more. It's functional but lacks a lid, which makes it prone to collecting pocket lint and dust. This is something to consider if you’re often on the go. Despite this, the case and earbuds feel durable enough to handle daily wear and tear.

**Sound Quality & Performance**

The JBL Vibe Buds shine when it comes to sound. The bass is punchy and immersive without being overpowering, which makes listening to upbeat tunes and podcasts equally enjoyable. The highs and mids are crisp, delivering a well-balanced audio profile. One feature I appreciated during my runs was the Smart Ambient mode, which allowed me to hear my surroundings without compromising the music quality. This is a huge plus for safety-conscious users. For calls, the VoiceAware feature was a game-changer, letting me adjust how much of my own voice I could hear.

[Check JBL Vibe Buds price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0bqpz7dmv/)

**Fit & Comfort**

Wearing these earbuds for hours didn’t lead to any discomfort, thanks to their ergonomic design. The ear tips create a snug seal, which not only enhances sound isolation but also prevents them from slipping out, even during intense workouts. I wore these while cycling and doing yoga, and they stayed put without any need for adjustment. My teenage cousin even borrowed them for a dance practice and came back raving about how comfortable they were.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery performance is where these earbuds truly excel. They provide eight hours of playback on a full charge, and the charging case adds an additional 24 hours. Speed charging is another convenient feature—just a 10-minute charge gives you two extra hours of playtime. However, I did notice that using advanced features like Smart Ambient drained the battery slightly faster, though not enough to become a dealbreaker.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**

While these earbuds don’t offer active noise cancellation, the passive isolation is impressive due to the snug ear tip fit. The Smart Ambient technology, including TalkThru and Ambient Aware modes, worked as advertised. I tested this out while grabbing coffee at a noisy café, and I could easily switch between focusing on my playlist and chatting with the barista without removing the earbuds.

**Durability & Water Resistance**

The IP54 certification for water and dust resistance is another reason these earbuds are great for active users. I wore them during a sweaty gym session and while gardening on a dusty day; they performed flawlessly. However, the open charging case design means you’ll need to be cautious about storing them in dusty environments.

**Advantages**

* Exceptional sound quality with deep bass that doesn't overpower.
* Comfortable fit with multiple ear tip sizes.
* Smart Ambient mode for situational awareness.
* Long-lasting battery with quick charging.
* Water and dust resistance for outdoor and active use.

**Drawbacks**

* The charging case lacks a lid, making it prone to dust and lint.
* Advanced features like Smart Ambient can drain the battery slightly faster.
* Touch controls can be tricky to master at first.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to the Sony WF-C500 and Samsung Galaxy Buds 2, the JBL Vibe Buds hold their own in the mid-range wireless earbuds market. The Sony WF-C500 offers a more compact design but lacks the Smart Ambient feature. Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 come with active noise cancellation but are priced higher. For users who prioritize sound quality and affordability, the Vibe Buds strike a good balance. However, if you need top-notch noise cancellation, you might lean toward the Galaxy Buds 2.

**Cost Efficiency**

Given their feature set, the JBL Vibe Buds offer excellent value for their price point. They compete strongly with higher-priced models without compromising on essential features like sound quality, battery life, and durability. If you're looking for an affordable yet reliable pair of wireless earbuds, these should be on your list.

1ixz4ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1ixz4ny/the_joy_in_knowing_that_your_friend_accepts_your/,The joy in knowing that your friend accepts your environmentalist worldview,"I received a really sweet message from my friend this morning. She had recently discovered a local coffee shop and she texted me to recommend the cafe because she thinks I would like it. I said, ""tell me more."" And the very first thing she advocated for was that the cafe offers a 50 cent discount when customers bring their own mugs.

I felt so loved in that moment. I've been very vocal about the harm of single-use plastic. I know that I'm just one person, and I can't fix our society's overconsumption of these plastic cups and plastic-lined paper cups that so many coffee shops rely on, but that hasn't stopped me from being my yapper self to my friends about the need for more reusable cup wares, and for coffee shops to incentivize bringing our own reusables. When I found out that my friend gets free coffee in single use cups every day from her apartment's lobby, I gave her my rarely used stainless steel tumbler, and she's been using it!!

  
Anyways, happy Tuesday, and I hope something environmental makes you smile today :))",19,1740501110.0,Anticonsumption,8,0.95,False
1ixz4dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ixz4dn/discover_the_best_semiautomatic_espresso_machine/,Discover the best semi-automatic espresso machine CASABREWS review for coffee lovers!,"As a daily espresso enthusiast, I’ve tested a variety of machines over the years, and the CASABREWS 3700 ESSENTIAL-01 espresso machine caught my attention. Its stainless steel design, compact size, and 20-bar pressure system promised professional-level coffee brewing right in the comfort of my home. After using it regularly, I can confidently share my experience—both the highlights and areas where it could improve.

**Design & Build Quality**

The sleek brushed stainless steel finish of this machine is eye-catching. It feels sturdy and well-made, not flimsy like some lower-end espresso machines I’ve encountered. Its compact dimensions make it an ideal choice for smaller kitchens or even office spaces. The removable drip tray and water tank are convenient for cleaning and refilling, adding to its practicality. However, the machine does have a slight industrial smell out of the box, which requires thorough cleaning before the first use.

**Coffee Quality**

Brewing espresso with this machine has been delightful. The 20-bar pressure ensures excellent flavor extraction, resulting in rich, aromatic espresso shots with a velvety crema. I’ve tried different coffee grounds, from local roasts to store-bought brands, and the machine consistently delivers. It’s worth noting that using fresh, high-quality coffee beans enhances the taste significantly.

[Check CASABREWS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0brsp8yt6/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

As someone who loves cappuccinos and lattes, the steam wand was a critical feature for me. The frother creates a creamy microfoam, perfect for latte art or simply enhancing the texture of my drinks. However, it’s not the quietest steam wand, and the noise might be bothersome if you’re brewing early in the morning or in a shared space. Despite this, it gets the job done effectively.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 49 oz removable water tank is a great size for multiple servings without constant refilling. It’s transparent, making it easy to monitor the water level. I appreciate the rubber plug at the bottom, which prevents leaks during use. Remember to remove this plug before setting up the machine—it’s a step I nearly missed!

**Brewing Performance**

The CASABREWS 3700 ESSENTIAL-01 brews quickly, heating up within minutes. I’ve found that running an empty cycle first improves the temperature of the espresso, a trick that’s now part of my routine. The machine comes with both single and double-shot filters, allowing you to customize your servings. However, the single-shot filter doesn’t always pack the same punch as the double-shot one, so I tend to use the latter for a more robust flavor.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Cleaning this espresso machine is straightforward. The removable drip tray, water tank, and steam wand make it easy to keep everything spotless. I recommend rinsing the machine thoroughly before the first use to eliminate any factory residue. Regular maintenance, like descaling and cleaning the steam wand, ensures the machine stays in top condition.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

While the machine operates efficiently, the noise during brewing and steaming is noticeable. It’s not excessively loud but could be a consideration if you value a quieter appliance. On the bright side, the energy consumption is minimal, which is always a plus for eco-conscious users.

**Warranty & Support**

CASABREWS offers reliable customer service, which I had the opportunity to test. A minor issue with the water compartment was resolved swiftly, and their support team was helpful and responsive. The warranty provides peace of mind, ensuring you’re covered for any manufacturing defects.

**Advantages**

* Compact and stylish brushed stainless steel design.
* 20-bar pressure system ensures rich, aromatic espresso.
* Milk frother delivers creamy microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.
* 49 oz water tank allows for multiple servings without constant refills.

**Drawbacks**

* Noise levels during steaming and brewing could be reduced.
* Single-shot filter doesn’t provide the same robust flavor as the double-shot.

**Product Comparisons**

When stacked against competitors like the De’Longhi Dedica and Breville Bambino, the CASABREWS 3700 ESSENTIAL-01 holds its ground impressively. While the Breville offers faster heat-up times and more advanced features, the CASABREWS is a more budget-friendly option without compromising on quality. Compared to the De’Longhi, which sometimes struggles with frothing, the CASABREWS steam wand performs better, though it could still improve on noise levels.

**Smart Spending**

For its price point, the CASABREWS 3700 ESSENTIAL-01 delivers exceptional value. Its combination of professional-grade brewing, stylish design, and user-friendly features makes it a worthy investment for coffee lovers who want café-quality drinks at home. While it’s not the most advanced machine on the market, it strikes a balance between performance and affordability.

1ixz460,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1ixz460/feedback_on_recent_stay_at_generations_riviera/,Feedback on Recent Stay At Generations Riviera Maya,"Howdy, making this post so others can avoid Generations Riviera Maya.  This resort was recommended to me by a travel agent on this sub and honestly, I can't fathom why anyone would recommend this resort. 

My family has stayed at a dozen different all-inclusive resorts in Cancun area over the years.

This resort is sandwiched between Nickelodeon and a couple adults-only resorts.  One of the ""perks"" is that you have shared privileges between the other resorts.  However, you can't take kids to the adults-only resorts (obviously) and you can't really just walk over to Nickelodeon.  You have to take a scheduled shuttle and you can't eat at any of the sit-down restaurants at Nickelodeon. 

Let's hit the highlights/low-lights:

\* The beach at Generations is terrible.   Worst I've ever stayed at.  You literally cannot go the in water more than a few feet from shore.  There are giant underwater rocks that basically make it impossible to enter the water.  There are also giant cement blocks in the water that are visually unappealing, but that's a lesser concern.  (Unless you are getting photos on the beach, then those giant cement blocks would be an issue.)  
  
\* The ""main pool"" is pretty dull.  It's located right next to the hotel so by mid-afternoon the hotel building is blocking the sun and you're in the shade.  The water is already cold as is but this makes it even colder. The staff tries to liven things up with trivia and other games but few guests seem interested. 

\* The food was ""meh.""  Honestly, we are not foodies.  Most nights we are happy to eat at the buffett.  We've always been more than satisfied with buffetts at every other resort.  But this one just fell a little short.  Lunch is almost always leftovers from the dinner the night before. 

\* There are 3 ""fancy"" restaurants on site.  Jade (Asian), Wine Kitchen, Habb (Indian.).  You would think the Asian restaurant would be Hibatchi-style like it is at most other resorts but nope, not at Generations.  It was decent enough.  Wine Kitchen was ok.  We didn't eat at Habb.  

\* There is a Starbucks coffee shop and an Ice Cream shop on site.  Neither one was open a single time during our 8-day visit in February.  

\* The ceiling/walls in the room are paper thin.  Again, this is NOT our first time staying at an all-inclusive resort in Cancun area.  We know that typically if your neighbors are moving furniture around, you will hear it.  But at Generations, we could hear our neighbors having normal volume conversations.  We could hear our upstairs neighbors walking normally in bare feet.  The sound just comes right through the wall.  We would even hear the elevator chimes coming through the tiled wall in our bathroom! 

\* The main lobby is not in the same location as the rest of the resort.  So you have to take a golf cart ride to get from the main lobby to your room.  This might not sound like a big deal, but it ends up being problematic in surprising ways.  For example, if you want an indoor spot to play a board game with your family or have a drink, typically that would be something you'd do at the main lobby at other resorts. 

  
Here?  Not possible. Or let's say you go on an excursion and get dropped off back at the resort late at night?  Main lobby is closed.  Now you've got a 20-minute walk down a dark road back to your room. 

When checking out, you will need to factor in an extra 30 minutes to get your luggage to the main lobby.  This is because you will need to get driven in a golf cart and typically many others are checking out as well.  So now you've got 30+ people all waiting for the few golf cart drivers.  

  
All in, we paid 13k USD for family of 4, Delta flights, 8 days, and one-bedroom suite with swim-out pool at Generations.   And as I've said, we've stayed at plenty of other places at similar price points.  Of all the resorts we've stayed at, we've never said ""we'll never come back here again.""  But Generations -- we'll never go back there again.  Happy to answer any & all questions. ",2,1740501079.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

They have helped me with pain relief, muscle relaxation, breathing, thinking, and overall have pushed me to keep my body healthy. I take them in minuscule amounts (like a sprinkle of cinnamon on your coffee) infused in tea about every two weeks. They help keep my migraines at bay, and from getting far worse. I might take them two days in a row at most. 

Well, I took a much larger dose yesterday, and low and behold: I have a baby migraine! It started as a dehydration/hunger headache yesterday, but has persisted a bit. I will say, it either is growing very slowly, or it just isn’t getting much worse and probably won’t. So that’s a win!

luckily for me, a couple sitting at a table by the door started coughing and sneezing really loudly, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. while they were all distracted by the cacophony of bodily functions unfolding at the front of the coffee shop, i waddled with purpose towards the customer-only bathroom to create one of my own. let's just say that the waters got muddy.

Love your place but please keep that bathroom stocked with an adequate supply of toilet paper. i had to switch to paper towels about halfway through. Holy shit that was gross af.",0,1740500508.0,burlington,2,0.11,False

My mom attempted on her life yesterday thankfully my dad walked in and was able to resuscitate her, and now she's safe in the hospital. 

But during all this I had a few conversations with my sister who is still a witness, basically it came up that I miss her and would love to get coffee or something to catch up if we can just have a conversation without religion being involved. And she full on just replied this religion is my whole life I can't do that. 

It sucks that I'm losing my family and all I've done is stop going to meetings. 


The court cases where they say they don't practice shunning and all that, total BS. 

I just couldn't imagine myself cutting off contact with someone simply because they don't go to the same church as me, it's twisted and evil and I'm sick of it. ",14,1740500360.0,exjw,9,0.94,False

Anyways, hope you're well. If not, maybe I can cheer you up? Otherwise, great! First things first, I'm a nerd who's looking for a fellow nerd, so if you aren't one, I'm afraid this might not work out. I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 33 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really fucked me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That means I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. Humanist. Very international.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve. Gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, it'd be nice to have some reciprocity, but alas, I was taken for granted before. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be something bigger or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll make it easier to melt my heart.

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list where do I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation? DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",1,1740500296.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1ixyrnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ixyrnx/do_i_still_have_a_chance_with_her/,Do I (still) have a chance with her?,"I really like this girl I study with at university and we used to have long eye contact and regularly smiled to each other in class, but recently she hasn't been initiating any of this anymore and I really wonder what the situation is now, especially after an interaction I had on the bus today.

I actually talked to her a few times, so we know each other, but we're not really friends. Hence, I find it very hard to determine whether she was just being friendly or not, so I didn't ever ask her out or anything. 

Now lately I've been thinking about our interactions and when I sum everything up in my head, I want to slap myself in the face, bc I feel there might have been something and now I just wonder if she might have actually felt the same way about me.

She used to look at me in class, came up to talk to me once and another time, she waved to me and I went up to talk to her and had a wholesome conversation.

With these interactions in the back of my mind, I was all excited the whole weekend and then the monday after, I saw her in the hallway and said with a huge smile 'Hey ... , how are you?' She said 'Oh hey, I'm good thnx, but she just walked further. Later, in class I saw her again and asked her about her weekend and she said it was fine and asked me about mine. So I tried to keep the conversation going, but later she just turned around and I didn't want to be annoying. I really didn't know what to make of this, but later when I had another lecture I came into the classroom looked at her, we made eye contact and I smiled, but she just looked at me and looked the other way pretty unbothered. Ever since she has looked at me less and less in class and we sometimes do have had eye contact, but she doesn't really smile, just looks in my eyes for a few seconds and nonchalantly looks away, but never comes up to talk to me again and I don't know if I should, bc I don't want to make her uncomfortable.

It's not like she's avoiding me (we sit one row apart each day)', but just not really talking to me/interacting with me out of herself (when I ask her something she's happy to engage) and lately. I'm getting really awkward around her, bc I don't know if she is interested or not. I try to be not too clingy...

Today a classmate asked me if I was looking at someone in the lecture hall and I foolishly told him yes, but didn't mention her. Later on the bus I was talking with one of my crush's friends and my classmate mentioned out loud that he wanted me to tell me who I liked, so I told him I wasn't going to tell him, but she would probably not be interested in me.

And this friend actually started grinning and giving me a playful look (she knows I wasn't talking about her as she has a bf) and I think she knows I like my crush, bc she gave me that exact same look when she once saw me looking at my crush sometime ago.

She didn't say anything like oh I think she does like you or anything like that, so I don't know what I should make of this.

I haven't had any eye contact/conversations with this girl all week, so I just wonder if should ask her for coffee anyway (as it might be a bit out of the blue by now), or if I should see if her behaviour towards me changes  considering this friend of her might tell her if she links my
