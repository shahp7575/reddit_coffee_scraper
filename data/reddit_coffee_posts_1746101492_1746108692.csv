1kc9o7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syncope/comments/1kc9o7u/syncope_or_seizure/,Syncope or Seizure,"I experienced my first possible seizure or syncope this past weekend at a grocery store. I am a relatively healthy 38 year old male. I remember feeling very lightheaded and tunnel vision esque and was trying to make it to the cereal isle to grab a breakfast bar. I had felt that feeling before and knew I needed to eat something quickly. I have always been able to avoid either fainting or a seizure in the past by eating and sitting/resting. However, this time I did not eat anything in time and woke up in the back of an ambulance. The paramedic informed me I had a ""witnessed"" seizure in the store. Was taken to the hospital were they ran some blood work and I had 2 ct scans. Everything came back normal (a couple of my blood numbers were abnormal but not alarming to the ER doc). After roughly 6 hours I was released and have a follow up with a neurologist next week. I was also told not to drive for 6 months, which has become very difficult for my family. Worse part I just bought a new car last week.

However, I am not convinced I had a seizure and am hoping all I did was faint. That morning I had only had a very small bite to eat and drank coffee and no water. I believe I was dehydrated and hungry and experienced a syncope episode. However, I still do not feel normal 4 days later. I am still very fatigue and feel lightheaded/dizzy, not the same intensity before my episode at the store. I have also stopped drinking coffee, which may be the cause of my continued fatigue and lightheaded feeling. I am just looking for some clarity here.

1kc9m40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frauditors/comments/1kc9m40/new_tactics_in_auditing_indicate_a_major_paradigm/,New tactics in auditing indicate a major paradigm shift in the auditing,"So auditing really sprang out of cop-watching, and keeping government servants in check and so forth, or at least that was the ostensible or supposed purpose of it.

 Of course as many of the readers of this particular subreddit will agree, that's really just kind of a pretext to get views and so forth on social media which leads to money.  ...hopefully


But now we're really starting to see a shift in auditing tactics, moving away from cop-watching and cop blocking and watching and filming governments employees, and towards something different, a new way of auditing, and one that is focusing just on regular citizens..


 I think maybe the most prominent new practitioner of this new style of auditing is the YouTube channel called iimpct media.. But this guy focuses on filming from outside of certain businesses that have a large volume of traffic. The post office is one particular way to get his interactions, but he films from outside  busy post offices.. so there's not really any restriction on his filming from that location..

and he also seems to be focusing on high volume businesses like Starbucks where a lot of people go in in the morning get their coffee and it's just really packed. He films from outside of it so he doesn't have any real confrontations with the police.. because he's really on public easement..


 and so he's not looking to generate tension and drama via interactions with the police ..he's just getting all his drama from interactions with people who stop and ask and say what are you doing, why you  getting my license plates on video
.why you filming my car..

 and he gives all kind of smart alec answers and that makes the people madder of course.. 


now I would think that the readers of this particular subreddit would see this as a positive move because I suspect that many of the anti-auditor readers of this subreddit and online on YouTube and so forth are actually police or someone associated with the correctional industry or something like that.
.. of course they may just be people who see the police as something good and so forth ..a positive part of our community... and so they're defending the police.. 

so this is really a move away from attacking the police and focusing on the police such as many well-known auditors have done in the past... and now they're simply focusing on drama generated at high volume businesses standing outside and filming. 

This guy iimpct media gets tons of great interaction with people who are mostly older and want to know why they're being filmed ..and they stop and ask him questions and he sort of tweaks them and gets digs in at them and tries to aggravate them and there's really nothing he's doing that's illegal.. and the people don't even call the police usually .
..they just have a brief confrontation with him and that's it .. this guy puts out tons of short videos on YouTube weekly..

...and I don't see him putting in police encounters much on his videos.... 

And you can also see amagansett doing this sort of thing now 
...but he's focusing more on generating drama with business owners in tourist districts of cities.... 


But this guy iimpct media I think has the new paradigm that is going to be sweeping through the auditing movement",1,1746108443.0,Frauditors,0,1.0,False

I feel disgusted with myself.,"*Preamble: Yeah I never made this reddit account to be serious, but here I am.*

For background I'm a forty year old white guy working part time third shift at a chain gas station/convenience store so I can put something in my savings account. There's one coworker that covers one of my nights off and she's pretty useless. We'll call her M. I'm constantly catching up on cleaning and stocking left from the night before. I could do a whole rant about the coffee machines....

So last night I'm clocking in when M is supposed to be wrapping up second shift. Instead she's got nothing done and now we're gonna be stuck doing shift change for thirty minutes. M is the only coworker I have this issue with.

Finally we got the cash & coin counted, dropped, and documented. There's still some food to write off, but I tell her I'll get it later and she can leave. M picks out stuff from the shelves, checks out like normal  and then clocks out in the office.

I'm just starting a transaction with a customer when M passes behind me and stops. M runs her hand up and down my back four times, then says ""you smell nice tonight"", before she scratches my several times all while I'm transacting with a customer. 

Between scanning the items while she's scratching and taking payment I put my hands flat on the counter. That's when M leaves and I stayed that way until I heard the door chime.

I finished the transaction once I knew she was gone.

The customer left and I stood there.

Who the fuck is this chick? Why the fuck is she touching me?

Why the fuck does she care what I smell like? It's the same body spray I douse myself in every night to cover the weed smell.

Like what the fuck? We all watch the same damn videos at orientation and even before those I knew you don't touch coworkers without permission. I would go out of my way to avoid physical contact just so other people wouldn't be uncomfortable.

Who the fuck thinks this kind of shit is okay?

And keep in mind I'm a forty year old white guy. If I did this to one of my coworkers I'd be fired, possibly face legal charges, and one of their husbands or boyfriends would show up to kick my ass.

Meanwhile I go out of my way to be chill, polite, and helpful at work. I know the public we deal with is often shitty and try to be the opposite. Be the change you want to see, right? 

But somehow this chick thinks she can be so fucking bold?

Like I'm some fucking animal at a petting zoo.

The sheer fucking hubris of this chick solidified could hold the orbit of a moon with it's gravitational pull.

I'm so mad.

I wish I told M to fuck off when it was happening but I was too focused on the work.

I wish I slapped the teeth out of her mouth for touching me like that.

Instead I just kept working because it's all my brain knew how to do at the time.

1kc9ev8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kc9ev8/does_the_cafe_du_chateau_french_press_coffee/,Does the Cafe Du Chateau French Press Coffee Maker Live Up to Its Reviews?,"The moment I unboxed the Cafe Du Chateau Espresso Maker, model number Espresso Maker, I could tell this French press was something special. Designed with a mix of high-quality glass and stainless steel, it radiates sleekness and durability. It's far from just another coffee maker‚Äîit's an art piece on your kitchen counter. With its compact build and ergonomic handle, it doesn't just look good; it feels sturdy in hand, too. As a coffee addict, I couldn't wait to see if this brewer could live up to its luxurious design.

**Enhanced Flavor and Smooth Coffee Experience**  
What stands out is the 4-level filtration system, promising a cleaner, richer coffee taste. Most French presses I've tried either leave me chewing on coffee grounds or deliver something far too weak. Testing this one out with my favorite medium roast, I followed their simple four-step instructions. The result? Smooth, sediment-free coffee with flavor notes that truly pop. My morning cup turned into an aromatic indulgence, and as someone who takes their coffee seriously, I was impressed. It's also just as effective for making a pot of tea‚Äîloose leaf works especially well!

**Perks**  
- The 4-level filtration system minimizes sediment, giving a smooth cup of coffee.  
- Dual functionality‚Äîperfect for brewing tea as well as coffee.  
- Simple, hassle-free brewing process.  

**Health-Conscious Build**  
One thing you don‚Äôt want in your coffee maker is harmful chemicals sneaking into your drink. Crafted from BPA-free materials, this French press exceeds both US FDA and European safety standards. Knowing it‚Äôs designed with health in mind gave me peace of mind, especially since I often brew multiple cups a day. I‚Äôve even started recommending it to my eco-conscious friends because it checks all those boxes.  

[Check Cafe Du Chateau Espresso Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01j4o0t4e/)  

**Build and Style for a Modern Kitchen**  
Durability meets elegance with this coffee maker. Its borosilicate glass is heat-resistant, and the stainless steel components add a polished touch. The tough handle makes it easy to pour without worrying about accidentally spilling coffee all over the place. I found it modern yet understated, making it a great gift for anyone who enjoys coffee or needs an aesthetic update in their kitchen. While it‚Äôs super functional, it also wins style points‚Äîit‚Äôs the type of kitchen gear you‚Äôd show off to guests.

**Drawbacks**  
- The glass carafe is delicate and requires careful handling.  
- The lid doesn‚Äôt provide a snug fit when pouring larger quantities.  

**Lifetime Replacement Promise**  
Here's where things really get interesting. The company backs this product with a lifetime replacement policy. I‚Äôm clumsy, and knowing there's coverage for potential damages or defects makes it feel like a zero-risk buy. A coworker mentioned that he tested the policy after breaking the glass accidentally, and they promptly sent him a replacement. That‚Äôs a company standing by its promises, and I respect that.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to traditional French presses like Bodum Chambord, the Cafe Du Chateau takes the lead with its 4-level filtration. Coffee aficionados may argue that the Chambord is the gold standard, but having tried both, I found the flavor clarity in this product is noticeably better. On the downside, its glass construction isn‚Äôt as rugged as some all-metal options like the Espro P7. While the Espro packs durability, it doesn‚Äôt quite hit the same balance of style and practicality.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For something so stylish and functional, it feels like a product that‚Äôs priced fairly. While you might find cheaper French presses on the market, they don‚Äôt offer the same combination of superior filtration and premium build. I believe this is one of those buys offering true value; even after months of daily use, it‚Äôs still working great and hasn‚Äôt shown any wear or tear. It‚Äôs an investment that pays off in every delicious brew.

1kc9ein,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVReviewLounge/comments/1kc9ein/what_makes_the_texco_40s334_40inch_smart_android/,What makes the Texco 40S334 40-inch Smart Android TV a standout? Review here!,"The **Texco 40S334** TCL 40-inch Class 3-Series HD LED Smart Android TV has been my trusty companion for over a month now, and I‚Äôve dug into everything it has to offer. This TV lands in the sweet spot for individuals who crave nifty smart features but are also navigating modest budgets. Here's what stood out, both the wow and the hmm moments. 

**Visuals and Display Performance**

The Full HD 1080p resolution is an obvious standout here. Whether I'm binge-watching action-packed thrillers or enjoying nature documentaries, the detailing and color balance lift the viewing experience up a notch. I even tested gameplay and animated visuals to see how it fares with fast-moving sequences. The refresh rate caps out at 60Hz, so while it‚Äôs smooth for casual entertainment, pro-gamers might yearn for those silky 120Hz or higher rates. Given its 40-inch size and 16:9 aspect ratio, it fits snugly both as a bedroom TV or a smaller family room centerpiece.

**Smart Features Galore with Google Assistant**  

Google Assistant being built into the system is more useful than I initially expected. Picture this: I'm sprawled on the couch, not wanting to move a muscle, and this TV effortlessly controls my living room smart devices. Adjust the thermostat? Check. Dim the lights for movie night? Double-check. The assistant‚Äôs ability to pull up sports scores or reminders is a treat as well, especially during busy mornings when you‚Äôre multitasking TV and coffee brewing. 

**[Ready to buy Texco 40S334? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://raltv.com/p/b08p4xjklq/)**

**Built-In Chromecast‚ÄîAn Everyday Essential**

With Chromecast built in, sharing photos from my phone or streaming an app not natively available on the TV has been seamless. Family get-togethers include throwing nostalgic videos from my Android phone onto the screen without searching for an HDMI cable or fiddling with settings. That level of convenience feels like having a tech-savvy best friend constantly on call.

**All-In-One Streamer with Thousands of Apps**

Streaming options are where this device shines. Over 700,000 movies and TV shows? That‚Äôs not just a figure; it‚Äôs my new problem of ‚Äútoo many choices.‚Äù Platforms like YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix work like a charm out of the box. Even cord-cutting initiatives like YouTube TV and Sling integrate smoothly, making it hassle-free to mix live TV and binge-worthy series.

**Practical Connectivity Options**

With Wi-Fi connectivity handling the heavy lifting, I didn‚Äôt miss having countless cables. However, its two HDMI inputs might feel limiting if, like me, your setup involves a sound system plus a gaming console alongside the occasional Blu-ray player. For Bluetooth lovers, there's no lamenting since this model doesn‚Äôt mention explicit Bluetooth support, which slightly edged toward inconvenience as I tested external sound equipment.

**Boons**

- Crystal-clear visuals courtesy of the Full HD resolution.  
- Google Assistant enhances multitasking with voice commands.  
- Built-in Chromecast elevates smart connectivity for mobile users.  

**Shortcomings**

- A slightly underwhelming refresh rate for gaming enthusiasts.  
- Limited HDMI ports compared to higher-end models.  
- Lack of explicit Bluetooth support reduces audio connectivity options.  

**Rival Brands**

Comparing this TV with others like the Vizio D-Series and the Samsung AU8000 reveals some interesting gaps and merits. While the Vizio offers similar affordability paired with excellent picture quality, its operating system lags behind Android TV in app variety and navigation ease. Samsung, though offering better HDR quality, tends to cost more in this size and resolution bracket. For casual users seeking app variety and decent visuals, the Texco model carves an undeniable niche.

**Price Worthiness and Bang for the Buck**

Putting this smart TV side-by-side with its competitors, it‚Äôs crystal-clear it delivers value for most users on a standard budget. While it's not loaded with extra bells and whistles like OLED or QLED tech, that‚Äôs a fair trade-off for the value you get. Personally, I‚Äôd recommend it for people who want up-to-date streaming services and strong smart compatibility without breaking the bank.

1kc9e4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1kc9e4y/am_i_misreading_my_managers_body_language/,Am I misreading my manager's body language?,"

I (25F) had a crush on my manager (31M) for a while, but kept things professional. Now I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs showing interest back or if I‚Äôm reading too much into things. Wondering if folks here can help me decode the body language.

Here are a few things that happened:

He always lights up when he sees me ‚Äî like huge smile, especially when he realizes we‚Äôre assigned to the same job.

During a tough convo with another manager opposite, he stood nearby just staring silently for like 2 minutes while standing at his desk. I didnt say hi to him after finishing with the other manager. Later, he joked warmly about me not saying hi during that earlier awkward moment ‚Äî ‚Äúat least say hi to me""

I called him once about a work issue, and days later I realized he‚Äôd saved my number and viewed my WhatsApp status.

He offered me coffee he had just bought, even insisting when I said no at first.


When I did finally say hi, he was visibly nervous ‚Äî touching his head, shifting, smiling with sparkling eyes, stuttering a little. This guy is normally super confident.

In team meetings, he often uses my name as an example or calls on me when there are issues with teams or google meets to know if I can hear him. Always eager to hear my opinion.

Gave me  positive performance feedback despite me knowing I didn‚Äôt do great ‚Äî even teased me lightly and reassured me when I was anxious about promotions


I recently replied ‚Äúcongrats‚Äù to something on his status and he just said ‚Äúthanks.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm doubting myself. Could I be misreading all this? I have noted he doesnt have such a soft spot for anyone else in the office.

Note: Dating managers isn‚Äôt against the rules at my workplace.

1kc9cpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kc9cpv/can_the_keenstar_jhc5010e_espresso_machine_truly/,Can the KEENSTAR JH-C5010E Espresso Machine Truly Elevate Your Coffee Experience Review?,"Testing out the KEENSTAR JH-C5010E espresso machine over the past few weeks has been an engaging and insightful experience. As someone who depends on that first perfect brew to kick off the day, I was eager to see if this machine could live up to its promise of delivering barista-quality coffee at home. Let me say right off the bat‚Äîthere are some undeniable merits to this compact, modern espresso maker, though it's far from flawless. Overall, it has fit into my daily coffee routine seamlessly, making mornings less chaotic and more caffeinated.

**Modern Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek silver finish gives this espresso machine a polished, sophisticated look that blends nicely with other kitchen appliances. Its dimensions (11.8"" D x 5.5"" W x 12.6"" H) are compact enough to slide onto my limited counter space without feeling overly cramped. I also appreciated how lightweight the machine is, tipping the scales at just 10 pounds‚Äîmaking it easy to tuck it away when needed. While using the espresso machine daily, I found the detachable water tank to be a lifesaver. Its 37oz capacity meant I didn‚Äôt have to refill it constantly, even with my back-to-back cappuccino cravings.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek, compact design that doesn‚Äôt dominate counter space.  
- 37oz water reservoir capable of multiple brews without frequent refills.  
- Lightweight and portable, making it perfect for smaller kitchens.  

[Check KEENSTAR JH-C5010E price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d8kfvgm7/)

**User-Friendly Touch Screen Interface**  
One thing that immediately stood out was the touch screen interface. Brewing options like espresso, Americano, or even cold brew are available at a single touch‚Äîa feature that made the machine a hit even with my less coffee-savvy friends. While some coffee makers often require fumbling through multiple settings, this one streamlined the entire process. Brew time is astonishingly fast, clocking in at less than 30 seconds for hot coffee. However, the user experience isn‚Äôt all sunshine. The touchscreen, while intuitive, sometimes felt a bit too sensitive; it registered accidental grazes as intentional presses, which added a bit of minor frustration.

**Milk Frother Performance**  
This espresso machine boasts a built-in milk frother that can produce creamy, rich microfoam, ideal for anyone who loves cappuccinos or lattes. Naturally, I put it to the test with almond milk, oat milk, and regular dairy, and the frother impressed me for the most part. I even snuck in a few attempts at latte art‚Äîthough ""art"" might be a stretch for my wobbly foam hearts. Frothing temperature was consistent, ensuring that the milk didn‚Äôt scald (a common issue in less refined espresso machines). However, the steam wand's placement is less than stellar. It felt a bit cramped, especially when trying to fit larger frothing jugs under it.

**Coffee Quality and Brewing Flexibility**  
Here‚Äôs where the KEENSTAR espresso machine flexes its muscles. The 20-bar pressure system guarantees optimal extraction, allowing for complex, rich, and flavorful espresso shots. I tested the pre-infusion feature, which wets the grounds before brewing, enhancing the coffee's depth and aroma. A nice bonus is the cold brew option, which delivers a refreshingly smooth iced coffee in under 10 minutes. It‚Äôs a game changer for anyone impatiently waiting hours for a traditional cold brew steep.

That said, the machine doesn‚Äôt necessarily perform miracles. Achieving the perfect grind and tamp ratio still takes trial and error if you're someone aiming for that high-end barista effect. Finer, evenly ground coffee works best to prevent watery shots.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Touchscreen sensitivity is prone to accidental activation.  
- Steam wand placement feels restrictive for larger milk containers.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it to other machines in the $300‚Äì$500 range (like Breville Bambino Plus or Gaggia Classic Pro), there are some notable differences. The Breville‚Äôs automatic milk frothing and broader steam wand flexibility might appeal more to latte enthusiasts. On the other hand, the Gaggia Classic Pro‚Äôs robust build quality caters to espresso aficionados with tinkering tendencies. The KEENSTAR sets itself apart with its budget-friendly features, like cold brew functionality and a user-friendly touchscreen. However, the aforementioned brands tend to outshine it in consistency and durability of espresso pulls.

**Smart Spending**  
For its price point, the KEENSTAR espresso machine delivers an impressive mix of features that bring genuine value to your kitchen. Touch screen ease, rapid brewing, and the inclusion of a milk frother justify its cost, though there‚Äôs a bit of room for improvement in overall design and durability. Is it worth the investment? If you‚Äôre primarily about convenience, good aesthetics, and versatility with hot and cold brews, this one is a strong contender.

When I first heard about MITOLYN, I was skeptical ‚Äî like most people. A lot of supplements promise the world but deliver disappointment. But what happened after I actually tried MITOLYN? Let‚Äôs just say: my body, energy, and life haven't been the same since. In this honest 2025 review, I‚Äôm going to share my complete personal experience, what I liked, what could be better, and most importantly ‚Äî why I believe MITOLYN is worth every penny.

[**‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://www.well-herbs.com/buy-mitolyn)

**üö® Why I Started Using MITOLYN**

At 42, I felt older than I should.

I was tired all the time.

My focus was fading.

My joints ached.

I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.

And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.

Doctors told me it was just ‚Äúaging‚Äù or ‚Äústress.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.

That‚Äôs when I discovered MITOLYN ‚Äì a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

**‚ö° What is MITOLYN?**

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function ‚Äî which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.

**Key benefits they promise:**

Boost energy naturally

Improve focus and brain performance

Support healthy weight management

Reduce joint pain and inflammation

Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.

üî¨ What‚Äôs Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health ‚Äî not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

CoQ10 ‚Äì Supports cellular energy and heart health

PQQ ‚Äì Promotes the growth of new mitochondria

Acetyl-L-Carnitine ‚Äì Improves mental clarity and memory

Alpha Lipoic Acid ‚Äì Fights oxidative stress

Resveratrol ‚Äì Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties

Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 ‚Äì Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging ‚Äî mitochondrial decline.

**‚úÖ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?**

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed ‚Äî 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:

‚úÖ Week 1:

Slight increase in morning energy

Clearer mental focus during work

No crash in the afternoon like before

‚úÖ Week 2:

Woke up before my alarm ‚Äî feeling refreshed

Digestion felt smoother

Less brain fog

I started to feel ‚Äúlighter‚Äù

‚úÖ Week 3:

My energy levels felt stable and strong all day

I could focus better at work for longer periods

My workouts improved ‚Äî less joint pain

I noticed a mood boost too ‚Äî more optimistic

‚úÖ Week 4:

I felt like I got my younger self back

I stopped reaching for coffee

My weight dropped by 3 pounds

I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier

üí• Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here‚Äôs what changed drastically:

‚ö° Energy: I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.

üß† Focus: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.

üî• Metabolism: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.

üí™ Recovery: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.

ü¶¥ Joint Relief: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.

‚ú® Overall Mood: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

üò¨ MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides ‚Äî and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

Not Instant: You won‚Äôt feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a science-backed long-term upgrade.

Premium Price: It‚Äôs not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth the investment.

Limited Stock: This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2‚Äì3 bottles upfront.

üíØ Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, yes.

If you‚Äôre:

Feeling constantly tired

Struggling with brain fog or poor memory

Battling joint pain

Gaining unwanted weight

Or just feel like you're ‚Äúaging too fast‚Äù

Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.

Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what‚Äôs broken. That‚Äôs why the results are real and lasting.

üîê Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not a gimmick.

It‚Äôs a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I‚Äôve tried dozens of products over the years ‚Äî but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

If you‚Äôre serious about taking control of your health in 2025 ‚Äî MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.

üõí Where to Buy MITOLYN?

Don‚Äôt fall for third-party fakes or duplicates.

Your energy, focus, metabolism, and body are worth it. Don‚Äôt settle for less ‚Äî get the real fix.

Thanks for reading.

I (42M) dated my ex, Carl (40M) for 10 years. He is a lovely man but we no longer were great in a romantic way. Carl wanted to be poly, I am as monogamous as you can find them, so we decided to call it quits while remaining best friends.

Carl and I own two coffee bars together. We have employees, we work in those bars together, for financial and VISA reasons (I moved to Carl‚Äôs country), it is just more beneficial to stay legally married for the moment.

Nor me, Carl, or his partners made any problems of this. When I met my boyfriend Tom, about 2 years ago, I told him that I was married to my ex who is also my best friend for VISA reasons which is true. Tom seemed to understand this, he met Carl several times.

Lately Tom has been more and more upset by the fact that I can‚Äôt give him an ‚Äòend date‚Äô of my marriage, he asks me often if ‚Äòin 10 years‚Äô this will still be the case.

Personally, I don‚Äôt really want to think about it, Carl is better off than me, if anything would happen, I would be the person who inherits everything and we are ok with that. Carl is also bi, recently, one of his partners got pregnant by him, which upset my boyfriend way more than it upset me. According to my boyfriend this was important because if she kept the child and asked for a DNA test by Carl, this could impact my VISA status.

He also is sad cause sometimes some of my friends make jokes about Tom just being the affair partner (he clearly isn‚Äôt) and how acquaintances often ask where my husband is when Tom is with me. I understand his frustration but I can‚Äôt really help it.
 
He also asks me how I see the future: living together, my divorce etc, and asks how it will be in 5-10 years. I personally feel very put under pressure, I live life day by day and can‚Äôt tell how things will go.

1kc92p1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kc92p1,Dawn Effect on Steroidsüòê,"In October of last year, I was (horrifically) at an A1c of 10.7. By January, I'd come down to 6.9. I return for labs later this month and am hoping to see it in the low 6s (and eventually lower). 

I have been VERY controlled on my carb intake for about the last 8 weeks outside of some carb heavy festivities over Easter weekend. I am also doing some narrowed eating windows (a type of intermittent fasting) and often do not eat from 5 or 6pm until 11am or noon.

The screen shots here are 2am vs 8:30am. I do have some nights where I go into the 80s (I haven't done as much exercise this week and that's usually where I see those lower numbers overnight).  The dawn effect really bugs me. I've had zero to eat since 6pm last night. I have had black coffee and water only. I realize coffee can cause a spike for some people, but I am consistently 40-50 points higher every single morning around 8 or 9am (I'm usually up by 5 to 6am) - from my 2am number. That's a big ole rise! 

From what I've gathered, this is a combo of all the various hormones that kick in during this window, along with liver dumping out some glucose because I've not eaten, and good ole insulin resistance. 

I am partially just ranting that I'm working my tail off to get my health in better shape (I've lost 30lbs since November and had those great changes in A1c), but I just don't see a shift in the dawn effect. Even when my sugars were far higher, it did the same thing, so imagine eating on top of that - ü§Ø. Now with much better numbers (still much room to improve), I get super discouraged with these crazy morning spikes. 

Anyone else have this degree of a spike even if eating very low carb (to the point of keto at times), intermittent fasting, etc? My numbers do drop significantly by midday with lowest numbers happening early to mid afternoon. Anyone ever gotten this to calm down significantly?

About 3-4 months ago I started having lower back pain from lifting my son. Even now he isn‚Äôt even 20 lbs, so you can imagine he was much lighter then. I guess I wasn‚Äôt lifting him with good form, but I don‚Äôt really see how it‚Äôs possible to lift a baby out of a crib or bouncer without straining your lower back. I finally got into physical therapy a couple weeks ago and obviously it‚Äôs too early to have seen results from that yet, but I‚Äôm just so worried. It‚Äôs so constant. I can‚Äôt bend at the waist even a little bit without pain. I can‚Äôt pick things up off the coffee table without pain. I can‚Äôt shift myself in a chair without using my arms to support my weight or it hurts. I have a sinus infection right now and it even hurts when I sneeze. I feel so pathetic. So many people have babies heavier than mine and don‚Äôt have this issue. Hell, my physical therapist has a son 2 months older than mine, and obviously she‚Äôs fine. Why am I so broken?? I‚Äôm 30, so not exactly a spring chicken, but not THAT old either. But I feel like I‚Äôve aged 30 years in the past 3 months.

I‚Äôm just feeling so hopeless right now. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom and I don‚Äôt have any local family that can come help me out. My husband is great about taking over the lifting on evenings and weekends, but it‚Äôs not enough. I‚Äôm genuinely considering putting my son in daycare just so my back can get a break, even though it‚Äôs really not something I want to do. But how am I ever supposed to heal when I have to do the thing that injured me a million times a day? How am I going to sustain this as he grows?

A little more about the pain: it covers a large swath of my lower back on the right side. Obviously I‚Äôm not a medical professional, but this makes me think it‚Äôs not spinal and is just from a pulled muscle that won‚Äôt heal or something. The left side feels fine. Sitting and walking don‚Äôt aggravate it. It‚Äôs a sharp ache that, as I said, happens any time I bend even the slightest bit, and is worse if I‚Äôm holding anything, even a mug of coffee. It responds to heat. Tylenol and ibuprofen barely touch it. I had a pelvic floor evaluation and they said it‚Äôs not a pelvic floor problem. I‚Äôve been trying to use my core muscles more when I lift and avoid putting him in his bouncer as much as possible because that pisses it off the most. But the little guy is getting to an age where he‚Äôs more active, so I have to entertain him somehow. I tried a back brace from Amazon but it sat too high to help where I needed it. I still have my pregnancy belly support band and that does help a little bit, but it‚Äôs hard to get it to stay where I need it.",2,1746106985.0,backpain,3,1.0,False

The Gladly Family WAG-GRA-2-S Anthem2 2-Seat All-Terrain Wagon Stroller, Graphite Special Edition, has quickly become a key part of my routine as a parent of two energetic toddlers. From daycare drop-offs to weekend park adventures, this wagon stroller has navigated all terrains like a champ while keeping the kids entertained and, most importantly, secured. Upon unboxing, it was clear how intentionally designed this product is‚Äîsleek graphite color paired with mesh fabric feels premium and not at all gimmicky. The robust aluminum frame gives confidence that it can handle the wear and tear of daily use. Folding and unfolding the product has been refreshingly intuitive, and the once-dreaded task of stroller storage became surprisingly easy due to its compact fold-flat design. Honestly, the craftsmanship makes its purpose clear: to be dependable and practical for busy families.

**Ease of Maneuverability and Versatile Usage**

Navigating this stroller is as smooth as butter. Whether on gravel, bumpy sidewalks, or maneuvering through narrow grocery store aisles, I found the all-terrain rubber tires with suspension to perform outstandingly. I particularly appreciated the option to either push or pull, which came in handy on steeper inclines where pulling felt more natural. The ergonomic handle grips felt completely comfortable even during prolonged use, a fantastic feature for someone like me accustomed to handling a fussy toddler in one hand and the stroller in the other. It‚Äôs a lifesaver for urban and suburban parents who are always on the move.

**Comfortably Spacious for Kids**

When my two kids climbed into their cozy nook inside this wagon stroller, their enthusiastic giggles were enough to assure me they were comfortable. The seating is well-padded, and the included double snack tray with built-in cup holders won their hearts instantly (no small feat). What‚Äôs more, the generous interior mattress provided ample room for the kids to sit, wiggle, or even nap comfortably during longer outings. For younger babies, the car seat compatibility and three-point harness offer added safety without compromising on usability. As a bonus, the removable canopies provided shade on sunny days and shelter on unexpectedly drizzly ones.

**Key Benefits**

- Smooth maneuvering with robust, all-terrain wheels and suspension system.  
- Foldability creates ease for transportation and compact storage.  
- Generous storage space, including mesh pockets and a removable storage basket.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The stroller feels slightly heavy when folded, which could be a challenge for lifting into car trunks.  
- While the canopies are effective, zipping them together isn‚Äôt as seamless as it could be.  

**Convenient Storage and Accessories**

For someone like me who seems to carry half the house every time I leave, the storage capabilities of this wagon stroller made a huge difference. Between the stash-friendly mesh pockets and a removable storage basket, I felt like I had conquered my battle with carrying all the diaper bags, snacks, and spare clothes. The parent-friendly cup holder was an unexpected, yet much-appreciated, addition for those coffee-fueled mornings. I should note that the removable components are super easy to clean‚Äîa huge win for parents contending with messy snack sessions on-the-go.

**Competitive Options**

You can‚Äôt talk about wagon strollers without mentioning alternatives like the Veer Cruiser and the Evenflo Pivot Xplore. I tested both briefly to see how they compared. The Veer Cruiser boasts simplistic aesthetics and durability but doesn‚Äôt nail the comfortable seating experience the Gladly Family does. On the other hand, the Evenflo Pivot Xplore feels almost similar in features, but its fold-flat mechanism and storage weren‚Äôt as refined to me. What makes this product stand out would definitely be the detailed thought to parent-friendly and kid-centric accessories.

**Cost Efficiency**

While wagon strollers like these might seem like high-ticket purchases, I genuinely think the Gladly Family‚Äôs offering is justified considering how much versatility and longevity you get out of it. Replacement or add-on components are reasonably priced compared to market alternatives, and the sheer quality of this product ensures you won‚Äôt find yourself shopping for a replacement anytime soon.

As the title suggests, I'm trying to look for ways to make my coffee-making more efficient. For context, I'm a college student who drinks iced coffee on a daily basis. I want to save more of my baon this semester by just bringing homemade coffee to school.  While I could easily buy Kopiko Lucky Day, I find my homemade recipe just better (for lack of a more fitting word). 

My recipe: 2 spoons Nescafe Gold, 2 spoons Brown sugar, any available milk (oatside, cowhead, bearbrand), ice (these are pricey ingredients, but my parents shoulder them naman). I prepare my iced coffee by first pouring milk up to 1/8 of the glass, put ice, then pour in my coffee mix. 

Some attempts I've done to make this efficient is 1.) making my coffee the night before para mababaon ko to school kaso I forget to bring it sometimes T-T 2.) nung pandemic, I used to prepare the coffee mix in pitchers. While this method made coffee-making easier, it sort of diluted the caffeine content i think (probably bc the coffee to water ratio is disproportionate) so im not considering it na. 3.) im looking into making cold brew at home kaso it requires a coffee grinder and beans soo im kinda iffy on this since my parents are thrifty plus i have 0 coffee knowledge beyond Nescafe gold and my milk selection T--T

If you got any recommendations for fairly-priced grinders and/or good beans for beginners please share them (preferably with links). Also if you have any suggestions to make my coffee-making more efficient please let me know! Thanks in advance!",1,1746106937.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False

1kc8wtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1kc8wtu/let_this_be_a_reminder/,Let This Be a Reminder,"## Embrace Each Day as a New Opportunity

Every morning we wake up is a blank canvas, waiting to be filled with strokes of experiences, lessons, and transformations. ‚ÄúLet this be a reminder‚Äù underscores a vital truth ‚Äî every day is an opportunity to redefine our personal narrative. Today, I invite you to reflect on how you can make the most out of the fresh potential that each sunrise offers. 

### Change Your Habits 

Habit formation can be daunting, especially when entrenched behaviors feel like second nature. Yet, each day provides a moment to evaluate and alter your actions. The journey of self-improvement begins with the smallest changes. Perhaps it‚Äôs deciding to swap your morning coffee for a smoothie or taking a moment each evening to meditate instead of scrolling through your phone. These small pivots can lead to expansive changes in emotional and physical well-being. 

**Action Tip:** Identify one habit you‚Äôd like to change and start by making it a 1% improvement. Commit to that adjustment for a week, and assess how you feel. Small increments in habit change can accumulate into significant improvement.

### Try Something New

Life thrives when we step beyond our comfort zones. Whether it‚Äôs trying a new hobby, exploring unfamiliar cultures through cooking, or even learning a musical instrument, engaging in fresh experiences can rejuvenate our spirits and expand our horizons. It‚Äôs easy to claim you‚Äôre too busy, but in reality, engaging with new pursuits can provide a much-needed break from routine stressors.

**Action Tip:** Make a list of things you‚Äôve always wanted to try but haven‚Äôt. Select one to pursue in the coming week and immerse yourself fully. Not only does this open doors to new skills, but it can also introduce you to people who share similar passions.

### Prioritize Your Health and Yourself

Health is an ongoing journey, not a destination. Prioritizing your mental and physical well-being is one of the most crucial investments you can make. Each day provides the opportunity to nourish your body with the right foods, engage in physical activity, or take moments of stillness for mental recharge. You might not see immediate results, but consistency pays off in the long run.

**Action Tip:** Dedicate specific time within your daily schedule just for you. This might mean morning workouts, lunchtime walks, or evening relaxation techniques. The allocated time can serve as a reminder that you are worth the effort.

### Build a Life That Makes You Happy

Happiness isn‚Äôt a mere accident; it's often a choice. Every day presents the chance to assess what brings you joy and what doesn‚Äôt. Do you find fulfillment in your work? Is spending time with loved ones invigorating or exhausting? Reflect and curate your daily experiences to align more closely with the things that spark joy in your life. 

**Action Tip:** Each evening, jot down three things that made you happy that day. Doing this helps foster gratitude and pushes you to seek out joy actively.

### Let Go of What Holds You Back 

Clinging to negative thoughts, toxic relationships, or unfulfilling routines can stifle growth and potential. Embrace the power of letting go. This doesn‚Äôt mean abandoning responsibilities but reassessing what truly deserves your energy. Evaluate the relationships in your life ‚Äî are they uplifting or draining? Prioritize nurturing those that fill you with positivity.

**Action Tip:** Set aside time to reflect. Write a list of things in your life that feel burdensome, and contemplate actionable steps to mitigate them, even if that means saying ""no"" more often.

### Believe in Yourself

This is perhaps the most crucial aspect of transformation. Self-belief is the cornerstone of personal success and happiness. Many of us wrestle with insecurities and self-doubt, but each day is a new opportunity to foster self-love and confidence. Affirmations, positive self-talk, and surrounding yourself with supportive influences can go a long way.

**Action Tip:** Create a ‚ÄúBelieve in Yourself‚Äù mantra or affirmation that resonates with you. Repeat it daily, and gradually incorporate it into your mindset. 

### Conclusion

It‚Äôs never too late, and you‚Äôre never too old to start anew. The beauty of life lies in its unpredictable nature and our ability to influence our circumstances. Let today be a turning point for you ‚Äî a reminder that each day offers new opportunities to evolve, embrace change, and pursue happiness. Carpe Diem; seize every moment within your grasp. 

The decisions you make today are the building blocks for your tomorrow. So, go ahead! Let this be your reminder and act upon it.

The list of my don't likes far outceeds the likes. I don't like most floral, citrus, oods, or many gourmands. I detest even a slight powdery scent. The only citrus I like is orange, the only floral is a very natural rose. I have a wider preference for gourmands but not if they are too sweet: vanilla, Tonka bean, coffee, bitter almonds, and a slight touch of anise isn't bad. I think wood scents are often too loud but I like their blending properties, just not as a clear note.

The only 'perfume' I've rebought was Juliete has a gun. I liked that it smelled deep and simple but also exotic and warm. Haven't worn it in a while in search of other scents but I recently smelled a unwashed scarf from last fall when I wore that scent and immediately fel in love again.

I also like Unmute by Noyz, there's a hint of powder but it fades quickly. It's smells like an unwashed G string or a dirty new York summer night. Antique Ambergris by Mandy Aftel smells like a ocean brezze blown inland, baked in a desert, and then dropped on a forrest floor. She also makes the only sweet scent I like, Bohemian Confection. It smells like losing your virginity at the state fair, stopped at the top of the ferris wheel, the taste of cotton candy on both your lips. The vanilla musk they sell at Ulta in the little bottles with the gold top also smells heavenly. 
 
Forrest floor, aquatic pond, clean sweaty skin, skin that was moisturized with coco butter, oilly/dirty hair, musty attic, damp basement, sweaty horse are all notes I resonante with. I like when it smells like I am the one who is making the scent, the phrase ""it came from her pores,"" could apply but only when someone gets close enough to actually smell it. I do want it to smell feminine on me, more male scents fit my pallete but as a girl I do like to smell feminine.

I don't want to say price isn't a issue, but with my type of scent it should be a little goes a long way and I don't mind a yearly expensive luxury perchase. I have a preference for solid perfumes but by no means I wouldn't love and use to death a liquid perfume.

Im tired of clean and bright high notes, I want a dirty fragrance but I don't want it to shout its presence. I'm a fan of a selfish scents. I want a long and complex dry down. I love animal musks.

""Can I help youse?""

Martin Macbeth glared over the register towards the corner of the shop at the man reading today's print of *The Havre Times*, the local newspaper for Havre de Grace, Maryland. Macbeth was a short, plump British man whose drab grey sweater seemed to match his everlasting drab grey mood.

""Hello!?""

The man slowly tilted his head up until he made eye contact. He gave a courteous nod. Macbeth was not amused.

""What're you doing!?""

The man gestured towards his paper. His dark blue suit was strangely formal for this part of town.

The headline was an announcement of the death of Paul Stine, a cab driver shot and killed in San Francisco.

Oct. 12, 1969¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†                                                                                    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Written by Eric Gould

ZODIAC KILLER STRIKES AGAIN!

Last night in San Francisco, cab driver Paul Stine was murdered in cold blood in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. Authorities believe the shooting is connected to the recent string of killings attributed to the man known only as the ""Zodiac"". Police urge all citizens to remain vigilant. Witnesses describe the assailant as a stocky white male, approximately 5'8"", with short brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses.

""You can't just sit there if youse not gointa buy somethin‚Äô!""

""Leave the man alone, Mart,"" sighed George Finney as he walked out of the back room. ""He just wants to read his paper somewhere quiet, away from the busy street. He's not doing any harm.""

""But he's been there for half a bloody hour!"" Macbeth exclaimed.

""So? Who cares?"" replied Finney.

This seemed to have shut Macbeth up.

The man left just before the shop closed. Until then, the day's activities continued as normal; there were a few murmured complaints from Macbeth, but other than that, and the usual flow of customers in and out of the shop, nothing else happened that day.

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Monday, October 13, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

The man returned the next day just seven minutes after the shop had opened.

George Finney watched from behind the counter. ""Back so soon?""

The man offered forth naught but a reserved wave and a tap of his newspaper.

Macbeth had not come in yet.

Today's headline of *The Havre Times* told about the robbery of First National Bank.

Oct. 13, 1969¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†                                                                                   ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Written by Eric Gould

FIRST NATIONAL BANK ROBBED!

First National Bank was robbed at 9:20 p.m. last night. The suspect, Bogdan Ovyachenko, is still at large for the thievery of $54,700. Suspect is approx. 5'9"". White skin color. Skinny build with a scar on the right cheek. Suspect is believed to still be residing within Havre de Grace.

If you have any information about the whereabouts of Bogdan Ovyachenko, please notify Sheriff Frank Paylor or stop by his office at 102 N 5th St.

The article below was an advertisement for a local bakery, and below that was an update on Paul Stine's funeral date.

¬†

Macbeth arrived at the shop over three hours late at 11:43 am. He glowered at the man while he settled into his chair, thinking long and hard about what to say in order to create the greatest conflict.

He ultimately said nothing, deciding instead to expend his energy scolding the woman who had come in to try to sell an obviously fake designer watch for a significant markup.

This day went much like the previous. Murmured complaints from Macbeth, and the usual customer flow in and out of the shop. Nothing else happened that day.

¬†

The week went on in a similar fashion. The man would show up early, exchange passing glances and the occasional wave with Finney, and then he would sit in the corner until closing time. The days began to stack up. At home on Thursday evening, Finney figured that if the man is to become a regular occurrence in the shop, it may be beneficial to develop a friendship. So, that next day Finney took his lunch break early and sat next to the man. Unsure of how to start the conversation, Finney went with the most basic of questions.

""What are you reading?""

The man looked up, then gestured towards his paper.

Oct. 17, 1969¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†                                                                                   ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Written by Eric Gould

METS WIN WORLD SERIES!

The New York Mets went into the day's 5th game of the World Series on the threshold of their first world championship ‚Äì and nothing about the amazing Mets is more amazing than the way they finally got both feet on the doorstep to the throne room‚Ä¶

""You a baseball fan?"" asked Finney.

The man nodded.

""Damn, guess the Orioles lost, huh?""

The man nodded once more.

""Although I guess if not the Orioles, I would want the Mets to win, so it worked out. Jack DiLauro is a family friend of mine. By the way, I don't think I ever properly introduced myself. I'm George Finney, nice to meet you.""

Finney offered his hand, reluctantly shook by the man.

""What's your name?""

Now this was a question the man seemed to think too personal of a question to ask, so with this, he turned back to read his paper and thus the conversation ended.

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Saturday, October 18, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

The next day, Finney was alone in the shop early. Macbeth had called out, citing ""a bloody nose that wouldn't stop"" though George suspected he'd simply gotten drunk.

The man came in right on time.

""Mornin',"" Finney greeted, raising a hand and offering a smile.

The man gave the usual small wave.

Finney walked over to the man, seated in his usual spot, and read the headline over his shoulder.

LOCAL MAN MISSING

Sheriff Frank Paylor has reported that Robert ""Bobby"" Driscoll, aged 31, was last seen two nights ago leaving the Rusty Crab Tavern wearing a red sweater. Driscoll, described as 6'0"" and slender with brown hair, has not been heard from since.

Any sightings or information on his whereabouts should be reported immediately.

Finney rubbed his chin. ""That's a shame. Bobby was an old friend.""

The man said nothing.

Customers trickled in. A lady bought a set of used candlesticks. A kid came in to trade baseball cards. The hours passed slowly and Finney was up to his knees in work behind the counter.

Once, Finney thought he caught the man watching him, but his eyes quickly returned to his paper.

By 5 p.m., the man was still there, reading.

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Sunday, October 19, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

The next day, the corner store opened late at 1 p.m., as is usual for them on Sundays.

By the time Finney arrived around noon, the man was already sitting outside. He followed Finney into the store.

Macbeth staggered in as close to 1 p.m. as possible without technically being late. He was mumbling something about artificial sweeteners.

He looked across the store at the man. The man was staring back.

""Coulda used you yesterday, Mart,"" Finney said dryly.

""Yeah, well, I had that headache, mate, remember?"" Macbeth snapped back.

Finney couldn't help but smirk. ""Thought it was a nose bleed?""

Macbeth grunted.

""That too.""

The man was still staring. Macbeth made a face, and the man returned to his paper.

Finney sighed and made his way over to the chair in the corner.

""What's today's headline?"" asked Finney. But the man still had yesterday's issue.

LOCAL MAN MISSING

Sheriff Frank Paylor has reported that Robert ""Bobby"" Driscoll, aged 31, was last seen two nights ago leaving the Rusty Crab Tavern wearing a red sweater. Driscoll, described as 6'0"" and slender with brown hair, has not been heard from since.

Any sightings or information on his whereabouts should be reported immediately.

Finney rubbed the back of his neck.

""Paper not come today?"" he asked, leaning over slightly.

The man said nothing.

Finney gestured toward the door. ""Mailman usually drops off the new batch around the side. I can grab you one real quick if you‚Äì""

Before he could finish, the man reached out and grabbed his arm. His touch wasn't violent, but it was firm enough to make Finney pause.

The man shook his head once, slow but deliberate.  
Finney blinked, surprised.

""Alright then,"" he chuckled nervously, easing back. ""Yesterday's issue it is.""

¬†

The rest of the afternoon drifted by lazily. A few customers trickled in: an old woman hunting for a brass lamp, a teenager picking through used comic books, an old man who rang up a case of Coca-Cola and a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes.

At half past two, the baseball kid came back in, clutching something.

""Hey, Mr. Finney!"" he called.

Finney glanced up from sorting a box of records. ""Hey there, kid. Whatcha got?""

The boy grinned and held up a baseball card. Autographed.

""It's Jack DiLauro! Got it from a trade this morning!""

Finney smiled and motioned the kid over. He took the card carefully, admiring the glossy surface.

""Now that's a good pull,"" he said, handing it back. ""You know he's a family friend of mine? I just may even get you a chance to meet him some day. You hang onto that one.""

The kid's eyes were glowing.

The man in the corner watched, his paper drooping slightly as he peered over it. His expression, as always, was unreadable.

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Monday, October 20, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

The next morning, Monday, brought an angry kind of rain ‚Äì a slashing, sideways rain that rattled the windows and puddled the sidewalks before noon.

The shop still opened in the storm. Macbeth was, predictably, absent again.  
Finney shook his head as he hung up his jacket, water dripping onto the floor.

He was about to switch on the coffee pot when the bell above the door jingled.

The man.

Soaked from head to toe, his usual newspaper clutched beneath his coat.

""You're a brave soul,"" Finney said, flipping on the coffee machine. ""Come. Warm yourself up. Coffee's on the house today.""

Finney poured two mugs, sliding one across the counter toward the man.

The man stared at it for a long while, as if trying to figure out what it was. Finally, he lifted it carefully and took a tentative sip.

Finney smiled to himself.

Small victories.

¬†

As the man sat, Finney caught sight of the newspaper under his arm ‚Äì still the same issue from October 18th. But this time, something was different.

Finney blinked.

There, scrawled messily in wet, partially smeared red ink were two words circled in the news blurb: *red sweater*.

The man said nothing.

¬†

The day dragged on, rain hammering against the windows like the steady patter of a drum.

Around 4 p.m., the front door jingled again.

A man walked in. Tall, wiry, twitchy. He walked over to the register.

Finney barely had time to process it before the man pulled a pistol from his jacket and slammed it down on the counter, pointing it straight at Finney's chest.

""Empty the till,"" the man growled in a heavy accent. ""Now.""

Finney's hands shot up instinctively. His heart thundered in his ears.

He swallowed, glancing at the man's face. A scar carved down his right cheek like a fault line.

Bogdan Ovyachenko. The bank robber.

Behind him, the man in the blue suit folded his newspaper silently.

""Don't make me say it again!"" barked Ovyachenko, jabbing the gun forward into Finney's gut.

Finney fumbled with the register, sweat slicking his palms. His mind raced.

He had to get help. Somehow.

It was then he noticed the man in the blue suit out of the corner of his eye.

He was standing up, slowly, almost casually. His face blank. Calm.

¬†

In one fluid movement, the man picked up the scalding hot coffee pot from the warmer and, without hesitation, flung its contents across the room.

Ovyachenko screamed, staggering back as the steaming liquid hit him square in the face. A gunshot rang out, piercing the air with a deafening crack.

Finney ducked instinctively, hitting the floor behind the counter as shards of ceiling tile and dust rained down. For a moment, everything was chaos ‚Äì the metallic scent of blood and burnt coffee hanging thick in the air.

The man had already moved to disarm Ovyachenko, wrestling the weapon from the gunman's slippery, burned hands with surprising strength.

Finney didn't wait ‚Äì he bolted for the phone and jabbed at the rotary dial, calling the sheriff's office.

""Armed robbery! Ovyachenko's here! Corner store! Send someone quick!"" he shouted.

Within minutes, the bell above the door jingled again ‚Äì Sheriff Paylor stormed in, gun drawn.

""Drop it!"" he barked.

The man released Ovyachenko and stepped back, hands raised.

Ovyachenko dropped to the floor, howling, clutching his scorched face.

Paylor cuffed him without a second thought, muttering curses under his breath.

Meanwhile, the man calmly took a napkin ‚Äì a pre-folded wet wipe from his jacket pocket ‚Äì and wiped down his coffee cup with meticulous care, especially the handle.

Once finished, he used the wipe to place the cup upside down on the counter and, without a word, slipped out the door into the pouring rain.

Finney just stood there, breathless, hands still trembling, as Paylor took his witness statement.

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Tuesday, October 21, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

The next morning, Finney opened the shop alone.

The man did not come.

Macbeth did.

He swaggered in just before noon, shaking water from his umbrella and wearing a smug grin.

""Looks like your mate ain't here today,"" he said, voice thick with satisfaction.

Finney's jaw tightened.

""He saved my life yesterday, you know,"" he said sharply. ""While you were at home 'recovering' from whatever you drank yourself into.""

Macbeth scoffed.

""Saved your life, my ass. Probably just looking to make himself the hero. You're just a gullible sod.""

Finney slammed a ledger down on the counter, startling a middle-aged woman browsing the candy rack. The woman looked up briefly, then turned back to her shopping without so much as a glance at Macbeth.

""He's a better man than you,"" Finney snapped. ""At least he showed up! At least he gave a damn! Where the hell were you, huh?""

Macbeth's face turned purple.

""This is your own bloody fault for being soft,"" he spat, ""And befriending that bloody weirdo you dragged in off the street.""

""THE WEIRDO IS THE ONLY REASON I'M STILL STANDING HERE!"" Finney shot back, stepping out from behind the register.

His voice tangled into a harsh, ugly knot of shouting.

The customers, what few there were, scuttled out hurriedly, clutching their purchases.

Even the baseball kid backed toward the door, wide-eyed and confused.

Macbeth leaned towards Finney, grabbing his arm. ""You think he's better than me?"" he hissed. ""You think you're *safe* with him? Some mute freak who watched you all day like a bloody hawk with a secret affection?""

""You know what, Mart?"" Finney started, clearly annoyed, ""I don't want to hear it. The only reason anyone puts up with you is because they're too damn tired to argue. As am I. I'm not listening to your bullshit anymore today. Go home or I'll call Frank and have you escorted out.""

With a furious grunt, Macbeth shoved the stack of newspapers off the counter, sending them tumbling to the floor in a crumpled heap.

""To hell with this place. To hell with *you*,"" he spat, grabbing his coat from the rack.

As Macbeth stormed out the door, Finney caught a glimpse ‚Äì just for a moment ‚Äì of a figure standing across the street under a crooked streetlamp.

A dark blue suit.

The man.

But when Finney blinked, the corner was empty.

Gone like smoke.

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Wednesday, October 22, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

The next day felt different.

The rain had finally stopped, leaving the air thick and heavy.

Finney opened the shop alone, the ""Help Wanted"" sign still taped crookedly to the front window.

At 8:07 a.m., the bell over the door jingled.

Finney glanced up, expecting the usual nod, the usual silent shuffle toward the corner.

But instead, the man walked straight behind the counter and pulled out the stool usually reserved for employees.

Finney blinked. ""Uhm‚Ä¶ hello?""

The man said nothing.

Instead, he adjusted the cash register, wiped down the counter with a folded napkin from his pocket, and stood patiently behind the till.

Finney just stared.

The baseball kid wandered in then, a crumpled dollar in his hand and a shiny new pack of cards on his mind.

""Hey Mr. Finney! Got any Topps left? I'm chasing Mickey Mantle!""

The man silently rang him up ‚Äì quicker and neater than Finney ever did ‚Äì giving the kid his change with a small nod.

""Thank you, Mr. Finney!"" The kid grinned, completely unfazed, and skipped out the door.

Finney still half-expected to wake up.

""Guess you're hired,"" he mused.

¬†

The peace didn't last.

At exactly 11:39 a.m., Macbeth came stomping in, dragging a fresh foul mood and an equally foul aroma behind him.

He stopped dead at the sight of the man working at the front counter.

""What the bloody hell is *this?!*"" Macbeth shrieked, pointing an accusatory finger.

Finney sighed, setting down a crate of old magazines. ""He's helping out.""

""HELPING OUT?! ARE YOU BLOODY INSANE?! YOU CAN'T JUST‚Äì""

""Maybe he saw the type of worker you are,"" Finney cut him off sharply, ""The type of *person* you are ‚Äì and figured someone ought to do the job properly. Maybe he figured it out when I almost got *shot* while you were passed out drunk!""

Macbeth's face twisted into something dark and furious.

""You think you're some hero now, Finney? Think you're some martyr because you weren't shot by some Soviet bank robber?"" Macbeth jeered, red-faced and breathing hard.

Finney could smell alcohol in his breath. He felt something break inside him, like a tether snapping loose.

""No, Martin, I think I'm lucky,"" he said, his voice low and shaking, ""Lucky I had someone there who actually cared. One who doesn't hide behind excuses and leave his friends to fend for themselves while he drinks himself to death, alone in his apartment, on *a monday* of all days, just because he doesn't know how to handle a divorce like a normal fucking person.""

A deafening silence followed, broken only when Finney continued.

""I can see now, by the way. I can see why Carol left you. You're not smart. You're not tough. You're just pathetic. Always have been. And you're a very, very sorry excuse for a husband. You're lucky she left you the house, but I bet that, too, was out of pity.""

Macbeth's mouth worked open and closed like a dying fish.

Without another word, he turned and stormed out, rattling the glass in the frame as he slammed the door.

Second day in a row.

Second time he left the shop in ruins behind him.

¬†

The rest of the afternoon passed strangely quiet.

The man continued to work alongside Finney like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Checking customers out. Organizing the comic books. Straightening the rack of chewing gum.

Still silent.

Still watching.

By the time he flipped the ""Closed"" sign at 7 p.m., Finney almost felt like they had settled into a rhythm.

He was wiping down the counter when the man spoke his first full sentence.

""You were there Thursday night. At the Rusty Crab.""

The words were quiet.

Measured.

Final.

Finney froze, the rag slack in his hand.

""I‚Ä¶ no,"" he stammered. ""No, I wasn't. I was home. I was‚Äì""

But when he looked up, the man was already gone.

¬†

That night, Finney trudged home under the eerie orange glow of the streetlights.

The world felt‚Ä¶ off. Like the ground had tilted slightly, just enough to make walking strange.

When he reached his apartment door, he noticed it immediately.

A small box, sitting neatly at the foot of the doorframe.

Wrapped in torn, faded red paper.

No note. No name.

Finney crouched down slowly, heart hammering in his chest.

He peeled away the damp paper with trembling fingers.

Inside was a red sweater.

Simple. Itchy-looking.

Exactly like the one described in the missing person report.

Finney stared at it for a long, long time, the weight of it growing heavier in his hands by the second.

Across the street, under the halo of a streetlamp, he thought ‚Äì no, he *knew* ‚Äì he saw the faint outline of a man in a dark blue suit.

Watching.

Waiting.

¬†

Finney barely slept that night.

The red sweater sat balled up in the corner of his apartment, like a bloodstain he couldn't scrub out.

When he finally drifted into a light, uneasy sleep, he dreamed of water. A river. Pulling him along the shore. Pulling him out to sea, out to sea so far even the lighthouses wouldn't spot him. Pulling him away from Havre de Grace. Away from Maryland. Away from his corner store. Away from Macbeth. Away from the man in the blue suit. Away from that cursed red sweater that still sat crumpled, across from the windowsill, where the moonlight illuminated the bright red fabric‚Ä¶

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Thursday, October 23, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

Finney woke abruptly a few minutes before his alarm. He found himself staring at the ceiling until it went off. He continued staring, unsure what to do, as it wailed uselessly on the nightstand. Does he go back to work? Does he leave town? Does he go to the sheriff? No, he couldn't go to the sheriff. Or leave town. Not yet. He needed answers.

The corner store bell gave a weak jingle as Finney slipped inside, the morning sun hidden behind a suffocating wall of gray clouds.

The man, of course, was already there. Next to the register, he was wiping down the counter with his usual napkin.

A newspaper sat folded neatly on the part of the counter that had already been wiped.

Finney hesitated near the door. The man nodded politely. Finney said nothing.

Finally, Finney crossed the creaky wooden floor, pretending to busy himself with the battered crate of records stacked by the far wall. His fingers leafed through dusty sleeves ‚Äì Johnny Cash, The Supremes, Wanda Jackson ‚Äì but his mind was elsewhere.

On the box at his door.

On the sweater.

On the man.

The tension grew thicker than bisque.

¬†

Finally, he spoke, voice low. ""I saw you yesterday. After you left. Across the street from my house.""

The man gave no reaction.

Finney swallowed. The Jimi Hendrix record in his hands suddenly felt too fragile, too loud. He set it down carefully and turned.

""You left a box. A little *gift*. Right outside my door.""

The man still didn't look up.

Finney took a slow step forward.

""I think you know what was inside,"" he continued, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice. ""A red sweater.""

Still nothing.

Finney exhaled sharply through his nose as he walked right up to the counter. ""It was Bobby's, wasn't it?"" He curled his right hand into a fist, pounding it on the smooth Formica. ""Wasn't it?!""

Finally, the man shifted slightly, the barest flicker of movement.

A breath.

A blink.

Finney's eyes darted down ‚Äì and that's when he noticed it.

An edition of *The Havre Times*, two days old, lying on the table between them.

Oct. 22, 1969¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†                                                                                   ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Written by Eric Gould

DRISCOLL FOUND DEAD IN BAY

Authorities have confirmed that the body of Robert Driscoll, reported missing last Friday, has been recovered at the mouth of the Susquehanna River near the Chesapeake Bay. Driscoll, aged 31, was found by Sherrif Paylor following an anonymous tip. He was not wearing his red sweater. Havre de Grace Police Department has not released an official cause of death, but foul play is suspected. Locals are urged to remain vigilant.

¬†

Finney's stomach twisted.

There it was, in black and white.

*Missing his sweater.*

*Foul play.*

He looked back at the man, whose eyes were now steadily fixed on him.

""Did you‚Ä¶ kill him?"" Finney asked, voice cracking on the last word.

A customer jostled the door open, rattling the bell, cutting the tension like a blunt knife.

Finney jerked back instinctively, pasting on a shaky smile as a young woman wandered in, carrying a leather handbag and a handful of loose change.

The man slowly folded the newspaper shut, creasing it neatly, and tucked it under his arm.

Finney watched him for a long, taut second before forcing himself back behind the counter. He felt like he was walking across a tightrope suspended above the Grand Canyon.

The conversation was over.

For now.

The woman smiled politely as she set down a pack of sewing needles and a jar of Granny Hawkins' Old-Fashioned dill pickles.

Finney rang her up on autopilot.

¬†

The day carried on like a tired sigh.

Customers came and went ‚Äì some looking for canned soup, some poking through the comic bins, one elderly man who insisted the store used to carry lemon drops and demanded to speak to the ""soused Englishman"" who sold them to him years ago.

Finney tried to act normal. He even cracked a few jokes.

But his mind kept drifting back to the newspaper.

To Bobby.

To the man, whom he kept his distance from.

The minutes crawled by. The sky outside shifted from gray to dark gray to the charcoal-blue of dusk.

At 6:57 p.m., just before closing, the man stood and walked quietly to the door.

Finney moved to follow. ""Hey! I'm not-""

But the bell jingled, the door swung shot, and by the time Finney stepped outside, the man was gone.

Finney sighed and returned inside, ready to flip the sign to ""Closed"", when the door slammed open again.

""Wait! Wait!""

The baseball kid skidded across the tile, breathless, clutching a few coins and a bent dollar.

""You're still open, right?!""

Finney blinked, then smiled faintly. ""Geez, kid. Barely. Whatcha need? Still after Mickey Mantle?""

""Yes, sir!"" The kid raced to the counter, eyes wide with excitement. ""Topps pack, please! The red foil one!""

Finney rang him up, tossed in a Bazooka gum for free, and watched as the boy bolted out again into the night, ripping the foil open before he even reached the sidewalk.

Then the shop was quiet once more.

Finney locked the door.

And left.

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Friday, October 24, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

The next morning, the sun was unusually sharp for October.

Finney arrived early. The man was already there.

As usual.

They exchanged no words. Finney didn't try. Not today.

The hours passed without incident. The store had fallen into its familiar rhythm ‚Äì customers drifting through like ghosts, Finney restocking shelves, the man ringing up purchases.

At noon, the bell above the door jingled.

Macbeth.

He paused at the entrance, as if expecting to be yelled at.

Finney just looked up from the register and said flatly, ""What do you want?""

Macbeth gave a long sigh. ""Just grabbin' me things.""

He shuffled behind the counter and crouched to rummage through his desk drawer. For once, he wasn't yelling, muttering, or grumbling about government conspiracies. He didn't even seem intoxicated.

Just quiet.

Finney glanced over. ""You find what you need?""

Macbeth held up a crumpled photograph of a striking woman and an old tin of breath mints. ""Just the essentials.""

He straightened up. Hesitated.

¬†

""Y'know, George,"" Macbeth started, ""You've been a good mate for years, but you're a bloody hypocrite.""

Finney raised an eyebrow. ""Come again?""

""You blew up at me for leaving you to handle the shop alone."" Macbeth's voice wasn't angry. More tired than anything. ""But I've never pouted when you've gone off an' done the same thing to me. Last Christmas. Independence Day weekend. End of September. Bloody hell, you did it two weeks ago!""

Finney cocked his head, looking confused. ""I don't-""

""No."" Macbeth cut him off. ""Save it for someone who still cares.""

They stood there in silence for a minute. Finally, Macbeth huffed and shook his head.

""For the record, I still don't trust 'im."" He jerked his thumb toward the corner, where the man was stacking books. ""That weirdo you replaced me with. Saw him outside my house on Tuesday when we last spoke. He wasn't watching me, he was watching the road, but still. I don't like him. And I don't like *you* with him. Just‚Ä¶ be careful, mate, alright?""

Finney didn't answer.

Macbeth didn't wait for one.

He turned and left, the bell over the door jingling faintly behind him.

¬†

That night, Finney didn't eat dinner. He didn‚Äôt even turn on the lights. He just sat in his kitchen, watching the faint glow of the moon as it crawled across his floor.

Watching the new box he discovered on his porch, slightly smaller than the one that held the sweater from before but still wrapped in the same faded red paper.

He wanted nothing to do with this new box.

But he had to open it. Right?

Finally, he built up the courage to grab it. He set it down on his kitchen table before slowly peeling it open.

Inside was a baseball card.

The blue ink of the autograph glistened in the moonlight.

Jack DiLauro.

The same card he'd seen five days ago.

The same card the kid traded for.

There was a slip of folded paper taped to the back of the card.

Finney staggered back against the doorframe, heart hammering so loudly he could hear it echoing in his ears.

Written on the paper were four words, scrawled in tight, shaky handwriting.

""You were there too.""

¬†

**‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì Saturday, October 25, 1969 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì**

¬†

Saturday morning, Finney didn't go to the shop.

He couldn't.

He sat at his kitchen table for hours, staring blankly as Jack DiLauro's face smiled back at him.

The four words ‚Äì *You were there too* ‚Äì burned into his brain like a metal brand.

Finally, around noon, his nerves frayed to threads, he picked up the card and shoved it deep into the back of his junk drawer, under an old newspaper.

Out of sight, out of mind.

He told himself he'd call Macbeth. Tell him everything. Tell him he was right all along.

But when he dialed Macbeth's number, there was no answer.

He called again, only for the same result.

Nothing but the repetitive chime of a reorder tone indicating a disconnected line.

Finney slammed the phone down so hard it cracked the receiver.

¬†

He didn't sleep at all that night. He sat up in his bed, staring at the sweater balled up in the corner. As if it would move if he looked away. Eventually, he fixed his gaze onto his reflection in the mirror on the wall. His reflection that didn't care whether he was good or bad, happy or

depressed, scared or lonely. His reflection that was always the same stupid face staring back at him.

He began to move restlessly from room to room, glancing out the window in the kitchen at the crooked streetlamp across the road. It flickered now and then, buzzing faintly, casting long, strange shadows.

Once, just once, he thought he saw the man standing there again.

But when he blinked, it was only a twisted blue mailbox.

Eventually, he returned to his bed.

It was then that he finally got some rest, if only for a few hours.

¬†

¬†

Just as the first rays of sun began to crack through the blinds, Finney woke up, crawling out of bed and back into the kitchen. With shaky fingers, he dug into the junk drawer and pulled out the baseball card again, throwing the old newspaper that sat over it onto the kitchen table.

He stared at DiLauro's face for a long time before carefully slipping the card into his wallet and forcing himself to prepare breakfast.

Toast. Burnt. A hard-boiled egg. A glass of the milk he borrowed from his store.

Nothing tasted right.

He tried to focus on the food, but his eyes kept flicking to the old newspaper.

Finally, he read the headline.

LOCAL CLERK FOUND DEAD IN HOME

Martin Macbeth, a longtime clerk at Bay View Corner Store, was found deceased in his home yesterday afternoon. Neighbors contacted authorities after noticing a foul aroma and unusual silence. Upon entry, police discovered Macbeth unresponsive on the floor of his living room.

The medical examiner has confirmed the cause of death as acute alcohol poisoning. Bottles of whiskey, gin, and beer were found scattered throughout the residence. Police report no signs of foul play.

Macbeth was 42 years old. Known for his blunt demeanor and loyal tenure at Bay View, he is survived only by his ex-wife, Caroline Hartsoe, who now lives in Nashville and has declined to comment.

Finney dropped his fork.

Egg yolk spurt across the table.

He felt the blood drain from his face.

That couldn't be right. He had spoken to Macbeth yesterday. Hadn't he?

The shouting. The picture of the woman. The tin of mints.

The warning.

But the paper was dated months ago.

¬†

The rest of the day blurred. He didn't remember getting dressed, only that at some point he was back outside.

Back in front of the corner store.

The bell jingled ever-so faintly as he pushed open the door.

And there he was.

The man. Of course.

Wiping down the counter with that same folded napkin.

Finney stepped inside, the door swinging shut behind him with a creak.

The man nodded.

Finney began walking towards the man. ""Who are you?"" he demanded. ""What do you want from me?""

No answer.

""I don't know what the hell is going on, and I can't help you until I do."" Finney continued. ""What do you want?!""

At last, the man set down the napkin.

When he spoke, his voice was more confident than usual. Not hollow or timid. Just‚Ä¶ real.

""You keep asking the wrong questions.""

Finney stared. ""Then what are the right ones?""

The man tilted his head. ""What did you see? What do you remember?""

""I don't-""

""You were there.""

Finney's breath caught.

""You‚Ä¶ I didn't‚Ä¶""

""But you did.""

Finney was silent.

The man continued. ""The guiltiest man is he who feigns innocence.""

Finney stammered. ""I- I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you want from me. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME!""

He lunged forward, fury overtaking fear. He grabbed the man's lapel, tried to shove him back‚Äì

And stumbled through the air.

There was no one there.

Only the counter.

Only silence.

Finney stood alone.

As he had for some time.

The following morning, Sheriff Paylor stood in front of Bay View Corner Store. He sighed.

A young boy had vanished a few days ago.

Paylor thinks the boy ran away from home. His parents swore he'd just gone out late for baseball cards and was to return within the hour.

He checked the store Saturday, but it was closed. He went home and waited on a warrant.

Now, Monday morning, the front door was unlocked. Someone had been there. Warrant in hand, he stepped inside.

The bell jingled overhead.

The place was silent.

The register was untouched.

The comics still in neat stacks.

No sign of George Finney, the sole worker.

Paylor walked slowly toward the counter.

A newspaper sat unfolded beneath the till.

LOCAL BOY REPORTED MISSING

It was Saturday's issue announcing the boy's disappearance.

Wait ‚Äì That's odd.

The words ""baseball cards"" in the article's body were circled in red ink.

Next to the paper, Paylor found a one-way plane ticket, scheduled to depart from Baltimore that very morning.

Flight TWA 11 -- BAL to SFO

There was no sign it had ever been used.

*Christ, George*, thought Paylor, *San Francisco?*

There was just one more thing on the counter:

A Jack DiLauro baseball card.

I slept with someone else 3 months into the relationship and maintained contact with her throughout (but never met her), sending explicit photos and reminiscing on that night. I also messaged sex workers but never met them. I've struggled with mental health for a long time and my partner knows this, the messaging was a form of dopamine hit for me and 'lifted' me up, but also created a wall or divide that my partner sensed throughout our relationship, eventually leading her to looking through my phone last august and finding everything. I had a ‚Äòtumultuous‚Äô upbringing to say the least, suffered a lot of loss early on and was essentially chasing dopamine hits and dodging depth.

Since then, she's moved out and we've spent 8 months doing separate therapy, having long, deep, and emotional talks, something which I struggled with prior. I felt like we were making progress and had found some stability. She'd partly moved back in in February, we'd spent time with her family and went on a few trips together that went well. This week however, she's told me that her hearts not in it, that she doesn't feel 'all in', and that she feels like we've stagnated and that she's been subconsciously pulling away. She told me she still loves me and cares for me, but doesn't know if she want's to be with me and is in a constant, and growing state of uncertainty about what she wants, despite her telling me that I'm doing everything right. She also feels guilty that she can tell that I‚Äôm all in and 100% but she can‚Äôt reciprocate.

Now, she's asked for 2 months of space which I have respected and we've just started, she said there's no rules about reaching out, and that she's looking forward to having a coffee on the 1st of July, to which hopefully she'll have found some clarity.

I'm at a loss, and I don't know what to do. I want to save this relationship and have been working so hard to grow and show her that, I'm happy to carry the burden and do the work, she knows this, but I worry the internal flame, or spark she has for me has gone.

I plan to make the most of this time and do plenty of therapy, focus on me and forgive myself.

2. Coffee goes in the basket. I tried espresso grind but read that wasn‚Äôt great and this clip was using fine ground instead. I tapped the basket as I was adding the coffee and leveled it without pressing down when I had enough coffee. 
3. Put on the stove with the lid open. 
3.a. Medium high flame (had it on 5-6)- coffee exploded and never achieved a constant stream it would just pop and make a mess
3.b. Had the flame on a 2. Took 20 minutes the coffee was bitter and I got half an espresso cup worth of bad coffee
3.c and d. Flame between 3 and 4. And that‚Äôs the video above. Took about 10minytes to get to that point, made a mess and even worse coffee. It was the worst of both worlds.

I (21 F) and bf (22 M) at the time.,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death‚Äîbecause my boyfriend didn‚Äôt want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn‚Äôt seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point‚Äîbarely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I‚Äôve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was‚Äîlosing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he‚Äôd want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again‚Äî I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I‚Äôd been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, ‚ÄúBut I love him and can‚Äôt let him go,‚Äù because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy‚Äôs interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I‚Äôm not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don‚Äôt directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends‚Äîboth to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I‚Äôd be alone again. It wasn‚Äôt jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket‚Äîbut I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt no sadness about that‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt important to me emotionally. I didn‚Äôt care about who he was as a person; I just needed someone‚Äôs attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I‚Äôve been tormented by guilt. I‚Äôve wondered daily if what I did was cheating‚Äîeven though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn‚Äôt mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don‚Äôt know if it is that or if my fears are true.

The thing is, she told me she has a boyfriend.

Now I‚Äôm really confused because:

Her personality is amazing - she‚Äôs kind, funny, and very talkative, which I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not even sure if I like her. I find her both attractive and not at the same time. Does this make any sense?

What‚Äôs weird to me is that even though she mentioned having a boyfriend, she invites me to coffee every day. We go to the gym, then grab something after, and we end up spending several hours together daily.

The hardest part is that I don‚Äôt know what to do. I like her as a person, but I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend. I‚Äôm 25, and I‚Äôve been a loner most of my life. I have a few friends, but they don‚Äôt feel like real friends. I also think she might be lying about boyfriend because when she told me that I had no reaction. I was like, OK, and moved on to the next subject.

I really appreciate the company of another normal, kind human being, but I‚Äôm afraid that this is above my social skill level, I lack the social skills to figure out this situation.

The last 4 months, I tried my best to change the things that I delayed because I was too comfortable like how I did with my last relationship. I want to keep it comfortable for the both of us so I didn‚Äôt demand my needs, and because of that he took me for granted.

Beside our relationship I realize I had kept that pattern in my life also so I‚Äôm trying my best to face it head on

Finished a half marathon with stats I always try not to push hard

Left my company that I stayed for too long and got a new job.

Trying to resolve my self confidence with my work and in life in general

Trying new things alone, watching movie alone, concert along, coffee shops alone, which I never did since I always got my friends or partner to be with me.

And work on myself physically, dress up more, take care of myself more to feel good about myself.

I told myself, I am doing great moving forward but some days still feel empty. 

After all the adrenaline, you‚Äôd still end up questioning why.

I know this is just part of it and 4 months is too soon to get over a 4 year relationship.

But sometimes it feels like it‚Äôll be like this forever, just distracting yourself to do things then cry when you‚Äôre all alone.

I hope it does go away eventually like they say.
Quite hard not knowing when will you finally wake up and the day will go by that you don‚Äôt think about it.
Because I don‚Äôt wanna live like this.
As much as it gets bearable day by day, It feels like one foot was left behind and you are just dragging yourself to move forward.

It gets tiring sometimes and you just want to erase all your memories and start with a clean slate but it‚Äôs impossible.

I want my spark back. I want to be happy genuinely again.

And I‚Äôm scared, what if I don‚Äôt get it back fully again.

I don‚Äôt know. Everything is all a blur. All I can do move and try my best.

¬†¬†Think of grief as an ocean you‚Äôve been dropped into without warning. At first, every wave knocks you under, but one ordinary afternoon, you catch yourself laughing at a meme and feel a stab of guilt. That jolt, says [Dr. Mary‚ÄëFrances¬†O‚ÄôConnor](https://psychology.arizona.edu/people/mary-frances-oconnor), is proof your attachment system is ‚Äúrebooting,‚Äù not misfiring. A little later, you glance at the calendar and realize yesterday was the six-month mark since the funeral‚Äîyou forgot. Far from a betrayal, bereavement researcher [Dr. Simon¬†Rubin](https://en-eu.tau.ac.il/profile/simonr) has found that these ‚Äúcalendar blind spots‚Äù show your hippocampus is no longer treating every date as an emergency flare. Even music begins to change shape: the song that once gutted you now lands with a bittersweet ache because, as neuroscientist [Daniela¬†Schiller](https://schillerlab.neuroscience.mssm.edu/) reminds us, every act of remembering gives the brain a chance to re-edit the emotional soundtrack.

As days spool out, you catch yourself planning a road trip or a new houseplant. That flicker of future‚Äëthinking lights up the same neural real estate as hope, a pattern resilience expert [Dr. George¬†Bonanno](https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/george-bonanno) sees in people who eventually thrive after loss. Your internal monologue shifts, too. ‚ÄúWhy did this happen?‚Äù slowly becomes ‚ÄúHow can I honor them?‚Äù Clinical psychologist [Dr. Robert¬†Neimeyer](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/research/psychology-faculty/neimeyer.html) calls this pivot ‚Äúmeaning reconstruction,‚Äù the moment grief steps out of the realm of unsolvable riddles and into the craft of storytelling.

With a little more breathing room, you notice you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to energy-zapping invitations. That‚Äôs your nervous system reclaiming safe territory, explains polyvagal therapist [Deb¬†Dana](https://www.rhythmofregulation.com/). Soon after, an urge to plant tomatoes, paint old furniture, or strum a dusty guitar sneaks in. Creativity is grief‚Äôs alchemy, the very process [Drs. Tedeschi¬†&¬†Calhoun](https://posttraumaticgrowth.com/) describe as ‚Äúpost-traumatic growth.‚Äù You‚Äôre not distracting yourself; you‚Äôre metabolizing sorrow into something generative.

These seven signposts‚Äîguilt-tinged laughter, forgotten dates, gentler songs, future plans, meaning-making questions, firmer boundaries, and creative sparks‚Äîrarely appear in tidy order. They ebb and flow like tides. Some days, you‚Äôll tick five boxes; other days, you‚Äôll feel slammed back to shore. That‚Äôs why grief educator [Megan¬†Devine](https://refugeingrief.com/about/) loves to remind us, ‚ÄúProgress looks like finding new ways to carry what cannot be fixed.‚Äù

So when the next wave rises, remember: the very fact that you can name it, ride it, and still spot the horizon means healing is already underway. Keep noticing the subtle shifts; they‚Äôre the breadcrumbs leading you back to a life where love and loss can coexist, side by side, in the same wide heart.

**What should you believe?**

¬†

Myths about grief timelines‚Äîand why they persist  
‚Ä¢ Media shorthand. Headlines want clean narratives‚Äî‚ÄúShe bounced back in six months.‚Äù Real grief is messier, and mess doesn‚Äôt make for a neat copy.  
‚Ä¢ Corporate convenience. Limited bereavement leave props up the illusion that productivity should resume quickly. The mismatch leaves mourners feeling ‚Äúbehind.‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ Misreading the five stages. Even Elisabeth K√ºbler‚ÄëRoss clarified that her stages were never meant to be linear steps ([https://grief.com/the-five-stages-of-grief/](https://grief.com/the-five-stages-of-grief/)), yet the public still treats them like a checklist.

**What Can You Do?**

1. Think of your days as a tide that naturally rolls between ‚Äúloss‚Äù and ‚Äúlife.‚Äù To watch that rhythm instead of judging it, grab any notebook and draw a line down the middle: on the left, jot moments when sorrow takes center stage; on the right, note times you pay bills, laugh at a meme, or cook dinner. After a week or two, a pattern emerges‚Äîproof that your heart oscillates between grieving and living. Seeing this ebb and flow on paper offers gentle evidence that nothing is stuck; you‚Äôre simply riding the waves.
2. Next, identify your ‚Äúoxygen people‚Äù‚Äîthe three friends or relatives you can text ‚ÄúNeed air‚Äù without explaining the whole story. Write their names and numbers somewhere obvious (phone wallpaper, fridge, journal). These folks will send a heart emoji, a funny reel, or show up with coffee when words fail. Knowing you have a tiny rescue squad at the ready calms the nervous system because connection, not isolation, regulates the stress chemistry grief can kick up.
3. Rituals might sound formal, but they can be as simple as lighting a tea candle whenever you make their favorite playlist or stir their beloved soup. These micro‚Äëmemories create a small, predictable container for big feelings, telling your brain, ‚ÄúWe have a place for this.‚Äù Over time, the match strikes, and the song‚Äôs first note, or the scent of garlic, becomes a gentle door you choose to open rather than grief barging in unannounced.
4. While your heart does its heavy lifting, give your body a chance to exhale. Five slow stretches beside the bed, a ten-minute neighborhood walk, or a restorative yoga video can lower the cortisol that prolonged grief keeps elevated. There is no need for gym clothes or a perfect routine; the goal is simply to remind your muscles‚Äîand your mind‚Äîthat you‚Äôre still here, still breathing, capable of moving toward a softer moment.
5. Finally, consider adding a trained companion to your journey‚Äîa grief-informed therapist, counselor, or peer group. They won‚Äôt hand you a checklist; they‚Äôll sit with you in the mess and name it normal. As author¬†[Megan¬†Devine](https://refugeingrief.com/2017/04/11/its-ok-that-youre-not-okay/) wisely says, ‚ÄúSome things can‚Äôt be fixed; they can only be carried.‚Äù Sharing the load with someone who understands the landscape doesn‚Äôt erase your sorrow, but it can make the carrying feel far less lonely.

**A Brief History of Grief Timelines: Why We Get It Wrong**

**(1) Ancient Rituals & Communal Mourning**  
In ancient civilizations, grief was a public affair. The Egyptians observed 70 days of mourning for the dead, while Greek traditions included ceremonial hair-cutting and wearing black. These rituals provided structure and pressured individuals to ‚Äúperform‚Äù sorrow within rigid timelines.

**(2) Victorian-Era Mourning Etiquette**  
The Victorians took grief timelines to extremes. Widows wore black crepe for two years and muted colors for another six months. Failure to comply risked social ostracization. This era‚Äôs obsession with visible mourning created a legacy of shame for those who healed ‚Äútoo quickly.‚Äù

**(3) The 20th Century: Freud & the ‚ÄúGrief Work‚Äù Model**  
Sigmund Freud popularized the idea that grief required ‚Äúwork‚Äù to detach from the deceased. Psychologists like Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross later introduced the five stages of grief, which many misinterpreted as linear steps. These theories, though groundbreaking, inadvertently set unrealistic expectations for ‚Äúcompletion.‚Äù

**(4) Modern Times: The Digital Age & Disenfranchised Grief**  
Today, social media amplifies comparisons. A viral post about ‚Äúmoving on in 6 months‚Äù can leave others feeling broken. Meanwhile, ambiguous losses‚Äîlike estrangements or infertility‚Äîoften lack societal recognition, leaving grievers without a roadmap.

**7 Markers of Healthy Grief Healing (No Timelines Required)**

**1. Reconnecting with Small Joys**

You laugh at a memory instead of crying. You notice sunlight filtering through trees and feel a flicker of warmth. These moments don‚Äôt erase pain but signify your capacity to hold sorrow and joy.

*Why It Matters:* Neuroscience shows that positive emotions during grief rebuild neural pathways dampened by trauma. It‚Äôs not betrayal‚Äîit‚Äôs biology.

*What to Try:* Keep a ‚Äúmicro-joy‚Äù journal. Write down one tiny pleasure daily, like the smell of coffee or a child‚Äôs giggle.

**2. Physical Symptoms Ease**

Grief lives in the body: insomnia, fatigue, chest tightness. Healing might look like sleeping through the night or feeling hunger cues return.

*The Science:* Prolonged stress from grief elevates cortisol. As healing progresses, the body‚Äôs fight-or-flight response quiets.

*What to Try:* Gentle movements, like yoga or walking, can signal safety to your nervous system.

**3. Storytelling Without Shattering**

Sharing memories of your loved one no longer feels like reliving a nightmare. You speak their name with a sad smile, not a sob.

*Why It Matters:* Narrative therapy teaches that rewriting our stories empowers us. When pain softens, we reclaim agency.

*What to Try:* Create a memory box or digital album. Honor their legacy without drowning in grief.

**4. Seeking Support Without Shame**

Early grief often isolates; healing opens the door to connection. You join a support group or confide in a friend without self-judgment.

*The Science:* Social bonding releases oxytocin, counteracting grief‚Äôs loneliness.

*What to Try:* Explore communities like The Dinner Party or GriefShare.

**5. Curiosity About the Future**

You tentatively plan a trip, a class, a new project. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúreplacing‚Äù loss but expanding your identity beyond grief.

*Why It Matters:* Psychologist George Bonanno‚Äôs research on resilience highlights post-traumatic growth as a hallmark of healing.

*What to Try:* Set one small goal unrelated to your loss. Let it anchor you in possibility.

**6. Accepting Ambiguity**

You stop demanding, *‚ÄúWhen will I feel normal?‚Äù* and instead ask, *‚ÄúWhat can I learn from this?‚Äù* Uncertainty becomes a companion, not an enemy.

*The Science:* Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) shows that embracing discomfort reduces suffering.

*What to Try:* Practice mindfulness. Apps like Calm offer grief-specific meditations.

**7. Honoring Loss Without Clinging**

You light a candle on anniversaries but no longer punish yourself for ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù to grieve. Rituals become choices, not obligations.

*Why It Matters:* Rituals provide continuity, but flexibility prevents stagnation.

*What to Try:* Design a personal ritual, like planting flowers or writing annual letters to your loved one.

**Conclusion: Your Journey, Your Rules**

¬†If you‚Äôre wondering how to nurture these signposts once you spot them, begin with what grief counselor¬†[Dr. Alan¬†Wolfelt](https://www.centerforloss.com/about/dr-alan-wolfelt) calls ‚Äúcompanioning.‚Äù Choose one trusted person‚Äîfriend, therapist, or fellow griever‚Äîwho can sit beside you without fixing or judging. Schedule a standing coffee, walk, or video chat so the connection doesn‚Äôt depend on how strong you feel that day. Then, create a personal ‚Äúboth-and‚Äù ritual that lets sorrow and joy coexist. Light a candle beside a photo while streaming a feel-good playlist; plant a memorial garden where new shoots and old memories share the same soil. Such paired actions concretize the paradox called ‚Äúholding two truths‚Äù‚Äîthat your person is gone and your life is still unfolding.

Finally, give your healing a loose framework so you can track progress without turning grief into a project. Once a month, jot down answers to three questions in a journal or phone note: ‚ÄúWhat felt unbearable?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat helped, even a little?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat surprised me?‚Äù Over time, you‚Äôll see the unbearable shrink, the helpers multiply, and the surprises hint at new possibilities. When the answers stall or darken, treat that as a dashboard light, not a failure‚Äîtime to tap a support group, adjust medication, or revisit therapy. As grief educator¬†[David¬†Kessler](https://grief.com/about-david/) says, ‚ÄúWe heal in connection, not in isolation,‚Äù and neuroscientist¬†[Dr. Mary‚ÄëFrances¬†O‚ÄôConnor](https://psychology.arizona.edu/people/mary-frances-oconnor) adds that the brain rewires through repeated safe experiences. Keep offering yourself those experiences, and the gentle rewiring will follow.

¬†

**Call to Action:**  
*Where do you see yourself in these markers? Have you noticed small victories you‚Äôd overlooked? Share your story below‚Äîyour words might light the way for someone else.*

**Prayer for the Grieving Heart.**

Tender Source of all comfort,  
We gather the fragments of our aching hearts  
And place them gently in Your boundless care.  
Cradle every weary soul who now carries the weight of loss.  
Wrap them in a peace that surpasses understanding,  
A quiet shelter where raw sorrow can breathe without shame.

When memories flood like storms,  
steady their trembling spirits with the assurance  
That love is never erased‚Äîonly transformed.  
Let each tear become a sacred offering,  
Watering seeds of resilience are hidden beneath the pain.  
Guide them toward moments of rest,  
Soft mornings when laughter flickers back into life  
And guilt loosens its hold.

Grant courage for the next small step,  
wisdom to ask for help,  
And patience to honor grief‚Äôs own rhythm.  
May tenderness rise inside their grief-scarred chests  
until hope, like dawn, spills over the horizon‚Äî  
Gentle, certain, and new.  
Amen.

1kc8gce,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1kc8gce/i_f22_found_out_my_mom_told_my_therapist_f55_i/,I (F22) found out my mom told my therapist (F55) I had feelings for her,"I feel humiliated and hurt. I started therapy for the first time earlier this year, and I quickly realized I was attracted to my therapist. She's incredibly beautiful, and honestly, I hoped she'd be more cold and distant ‚Äî but she wasn‚Äôt. She was warm, welcoming, and kind.

In just our second session, I disclosed my experience with SA, and she shared her own story in response. It felt like a pivotal moment in building emotional trust and connection between us. During that same session, she told me that she doesn‚Äôt just forget about clients when the session ends ‚Äî that my story stuck with her.

She also told me I was beautiful, and once asked if I‚Äôd ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend. When I said no, she replied,¬†*‚ÄúWell, they must all be blind.‚Äù*¬†That moment intensified my emotions and attachment. She continued to compliment my appearance in later sessions and said I must get a lot of attention because I‚Äôm ‚Äúvery attractive.‚Äù At another point, when I told her I felt like a burden, she said,¬†*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my priority.‚Äù*

I eventually came out to her as a lesbian. She was the first person I ever told, and she said she was ""honoured"" and even admitted she sometimes questions her own sexuality from time to time.

She encouraged me to text her anytime if I felt low, and said we could even meet outside of sessions. Our hugs at the end of each session lasted 10‚Äì20 seconds ‚Äî always tight, always meaningful. One night, when things turned violent in my home, I texted her at 1AM in distress. I didn‚Äôt expect a reply, but she responded with:¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you not just as a therapist, but because I care x.‚Äù*¬†She even offered to send a taxi to bring me to her house to stay the night. I declined, but she then suggested we meet for coffee another time.

My feelings for her grew, and eventually I wrote her a letter and made her a CD with some of my favorite songs ‚Äî Jeff Buckley, Adrianne Lenker, and others. My mom found it before I had the chance to give it to her. She immediately messaged my therapist to tell her I was in love and demanded she cut off contact with me ‚Äî all before I got the chance to speak for myself.

I feel so embarrassed and exposed. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward from this. I feel violated, confused, and heartbroken. What do I do now? Has anyone else been through something similar? I'm struggling to make sense of what happened and what to do next. Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you :)",1,1746105326.0,therapy,1,1.0,False

**‚ÄúWhat are we doing with our lives?‚Äù**

From the outside, we had it all. A home we loved in Denver, thriving businesses we built from the ground up, and a comfortable life. But, inside, we felt stuck, like hamsters on a wheel. We felt successful, but . fulfilled? Not anymore, we were seeking a new chapter.

Then came the crazy idea. After reading about ‚Ç¨1 homes in Italy, we started dreaming out loud:

**What if we just sold everything, packed up our 4 cats, and moved to Europe?**  
It sounded like an impossible dream. How would we give up our businesses, our home, our stability?  
But something deeper than fear said *go*.

That ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù became something we kept coming back to.

Spain called to us, somewhere rural, more connected to nature, with a longer growing season (goodbye to shoveling snow in Denver!). We found Galicia by a happy accident, and when we discovered *La Casa Del Casta√±o*, we knew it would be the place.

A diamond in the rough.  
Three houses on the property, including a stone barn from the 1800s that we referred to as the ""ruin"".

We had no intentions to remodel in Spain, but this place  
it felt like it could be an incredible opportunity.  The land, the trees, the all the potential.

We went back to Denver, and after a year of preparation we were able to sell everything, and we dropped our fear, packed up our cats and took the huge leap.

Now, close to 3 years later, we‚Äôre deep in the journey of restoring this special place. We‚Äôre creating a botanical garden experience, renovating the old stone houses, helping rescue stray cats, and building a simple, intentional life we never knew could be possible.

We created this community to share with you our simple lifestyle and help you discover your own courage to follow that voice that says **‚ÄúBut what if it** ***can*** **happen?‚Äù**

Follow along for our stories of renovation, homesteading, gardening, slow living, discoveries in Galicia, and our cat rescue stories.  
We can‚Äôt wait to open up our villa to guests soon and share this tranquil space we now call home.

## ‚Å¢Key Features Analysis

The best iPhone 16 Pro‚Å§ Max privacy screen protectors boast a range of advanced features designed to ‚Å§provide‚Äç optimal protection and privacy.**Privacy Technology:** The core function of a privacy ‚Äçscreen protector is to limit‚Äç the viewing angle, typically to around 30 degrees on either side of the phone.This ensures that only the user directly‚Å¢ in front of‚Äå the screen can see the content clearly, while those‚Å£ beside you see a darkened or blurred display. Advanced models utilize micro-louver technology‚Äå to achieve this, creating a physical barrier to viewing‚Äå from side angles.

**Material and Hardness:**‚Äç Premium screen ‚Äçprotectors are constructed from tempered glass with a high hardness rating, usually 9H. This hardness level provides excellent resistance to scratches, scuffs, and minor impacts, protecting the iPhone 16 Pro MaxS screen from damage. The glass is often treated‚Å§ with an oleophobic coating to repel‚Å¢ fingerprints and smudges,‚Å§ maintaining a clean and clear display.

**Touch Sensitivity and‚Äç Clarity:** High-quality privacy screen protectors are ‚Äådesigned to maintain the original touch sensitivity‚Äå and display clarity of the iPhone‚Å¢ 16 Pro‚Å£ Max.They are ultra-thin, typically around 0.33mm,to ensure responsive touch input ‚Äåand minimal interference with the‚Äå phone's display. Some models also ‚Å§feature‚Äã an anti-glare coating to reduce reflections and improve ‚Äãvisibility in luminous environments.

**Installation and Fit:** A seamless and bubble-free installation is essential for a positive user experience. The best privacy screen protectors come with an installation kit that includes ‚Å§an alignment frame,cleaning wipes,and dust removal stickers. the‚Äå screen protector is precisely‚Å¢ cut to fit the iPhone 16 Pro max's screen perfectly, covering the entire display without interfering with the front-facing camera ‚Å£or sensors.**Durability and Longevity:** The‚Å¢ durability ‚Å£of a privacy screen protector is crucial for long-term protection. Premium models are built to withstand‚Å§ daily ‚Å£wear and tear,‚Å¢ maintaining their privacy and protective properties over time. ‚Å¢Some manufacturers offer extended warranties or guarantees to‚Å£ ensure customer satisfaction and product reliability.**Blue Light Filter:**‚Å£ many advanced privacy screen protectors incorporate a blue light filter. ‚Å§This‚Äå feature reduces the amount of blue light‚Å£ emitted from the screen, which can help alleviate eye strain and improve sleep quality, especially during prolonged use.

## core Benefits

Choosing the‚Å£ right privacy screen protector offers several significant benefits‚Å¢ that enhance your iPhone 16 Pro‚Äã Max experience and safeguard your personal information.

**Enhanced ‚Å¢Privacy:** The most ‚Äçapparent‚Äã benefit is the increased privacy it provides. Whether you‚Äôre checking ‚Å£sensitive emails on public transport or ‚Äãhandling‚Äå confidential data in a‚Å§ coffee shop,the privacy screen ‚Äçprevents prying eyes from viewing ‚Å¢your screen,giving increased peace of mind and security.

**Screen Protection:** Beyond privacy, the screen protector acts as a robust shield against scratches, scuffs, and minor impacts. This is especially significant for the ‚Äçhigh-value ‚Å¢iPhone 16 Pro Max, as‚Å§ screen ‚Äãrepairs can be‚Å¢ costly and inconvenient. ‚ÄåThe 9H hardness ‚Å§rating ensures‚Å§ formidable scratch resistance, prolonging the life of ‚Å£your device's display.

**Improved Eye comfort:** Some ‚Äçpremium screen protectors include a blue ‚Äçlight ‚Äãfilter ‚Äçto reduce eye strain, especially during long‚Å£ periods of‚Å§ usage. By blocking harmful blue light emitted from the screen,these screen protectors enhance eye comfort ‚Äåand may contribute to ‚Äãhealthier sleep patterns.

**Reduced Fingerprints and Smudges:** The‚Å¢ oleophobic coating on many privacy screen protectors helps to repel fingerprints and smudges, ‚Äãmaking the screen easier to clean‚Å§ and maintain. this not only keeps the display looking pristine but also ‚Äåimproves visibility, ‚Äåespecially in bright sunlight.

**Maintained Touch Sensitivity:** High-quality privacy screen protectors are‚Å£ designed to be ultra-thin ‚Å§and responsive, ensuring that the touch sensitivity of ‚Äåyour iPhone 16 Pro Max is ‚Äãnot compromised.

Spoiler: It's More Than Just a Small Budget,"**Welcome, traveler!** Today, you‚Äôve chosen the quest: *Deciphering what makes a game truly indie.* Prepare your imagination, a thermos of coffee, and +5 stamina boost.

# Level 1: What Even Is an Indie Game?

An indie game is a project crafted by a small but mighty team (or a lone, passionate developer) ‚Äî without a treasure chest of funds from major publishers.

‚ú® **Starter Pack for an Indie Dev:**

* **Independence:** You‚Äôre the captain of your ship, sometimes also the chef, navigator, and animator of the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button.
* **Limited Resources:** Development fueled by sheer belief in the project.
* **Unique Style:** Experimenting with gameplay, narrative, and graphics like no one‚Äôs watching (and at first, no one *is* watching).

# Level 2: Indie vs. AAA ‚Äî Who Wins?

|**Criteria**|**Indie Games**|**AAA Games**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Budget**|From ""a few coins"" to ""shock success""|Budgets that could buy San Andreas itself|
|**Team**|1‚Äì10 brave adventurers|100‚Äì1000 corporate warriors|
|**Development Time**|6 months ‚Äì 3 years of raw passion|3‚Äì7 years under KPI surveillance|
|**Risks**|**9000%**Danger level:  |Everything goes to plan, minimal risk|
|**Creativity**|Brilliant madness|Innovation by instruction|

# Level 3: Why Do Indie Games Capture Our Hearts?

‚úÖ **Unconventional Ideas:** When there‚Äôs no ‚Äúdo it like last time‚Äù rule, gems like *Undertale* and *Baba Is You* emerge.

‚úÖ **Emotional Stories:** Without a Hollywood-level cutscene budget, devs pour soul into narratives ‚Äî *To the Moon* and *Hellblade: Senua‚Äôs Sacrifice*.

‚úÖ **Cult Visual Style:** When ultra-realistic graphics aren‚Äôt an option, distinct aesthetics shine ‚Äî *Hollow Knight* and *Return of the Obra Dinn*.

# Level 4: Top 5 Indie Legends

üèÜ *Minecraft* ‚Äî The little cube empire that became a billion-dollar giant. üèÜ *Stardew Valley* ‚Äî A dream farm, crafted by one person. üèÜ *Among Us* ‚Äî ""I swear I‚Äôm not the impostor!"" 2020 won‚Äôt forget. üèÜ *Hades* ‚Äî Indie quality nearly at AAA level. üèÜ *Cuphead* ‚Äî Hand-drawn cartoon madness turned hardcore.

# Level 5: The Catch?

‚ö† **High risk:** Success odds are like landing a legendary sword on your first attempt. ‚ö† **Crunch time:** Sleepless nights leveling up endurance. ‚ö† **Marketing matters:** Even brilliance can fade if unnoticed.

# Level 6: What‚Äôs Next?

The future belongs to the dreamers! üöÄ Unity, Godot, AI tools ‚Äî these are your swords and magical artifacts.

# Trending:

üî• **Hybrid Genres:** *(Inscryption)* üî• **Dystopian Narratives:** *(Papers, Please)* üî• **Minimalism:** *(A Short Hike)*

1kc85p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1kc85p1/local_candlemaking_classes/,Local Candle-Making Classes,"So, here‚Äôs a fun little venture that could light up your life‚Äîliterally and figuratively: hosting in-person workshops on making custom candles. I mean, what‚Äôs more satisfying than watching a wick turn into a flickering glow of creative chaos right before your eyes? Picture this: a cozy room filled with the warm scent of melting wax and the chatter of eager candle-makers, some of whom may or may not have come for the snacks (you can include snacks, right?).

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the marketing side of things. Social media is like the mega-horn of our time, and using it effectively for your candle workshops could send your community into a fragrant frenzy. Instagram and Facebook are goldmines for showcasing your beautiful candle creations. Snap some vibrant photos of the colorful wax and the whimsical shapes you and your attendees can craft. Hashtags are your friends; #CandleCulture, #WickAndWax, #GlowUp, and any other clever puns you can think of will help you reach those candle-loving souls eager to ignite their creativity.

And then there are community boards. Never underestimate the power of a well-placed flyer. Think about it: ‚ÄúLearn to Make Candles‚ÄîBecause Your Home Deserves to Smell Like Something Other Than Your Last Attempt at Cooking.‚Äù Post those gems everywhere‚Äîcoffee shops, libraries, local shops. You want people to stumble across your workshop and think, ‚ÄúYes! My life is incomplete without a homemade candle!‚Äù 

As for the workshop itself, think about how to foster that community vibe. Create an environment where everyone can express their creativity and, more importantly, share a few laughs. Every failed pour or overly scented catastrophe can become a shared joke‚Äînothing bonds people like ridiculously scented candles that resemble something from a science experiment gone wrong. You might even want to incorporate a moment of reflection, perhaps weaving in a little time for participants to share their favorite scents and what those scents remind them of. After all, there‚Äôs something deeply spiritual about scents that evoke memories, and it could be a beautiful discussion starter.

And whether you‚Äôre a candle pro or still figuring out which end of the wick goes where (we‚Äôve all been there), remember, it‚Äôs about the experience and the connection you create. Invite them to reflect on their own creative journeys. Ask questions that draw out their stories.

This might just be the beginning of creating a community of candle enthusiasts, where people gather together, learning from each other's experiences, and maybe even finding a bit of their own faith journey in those glowing, hand-poured miracles. So roll up your sleeves, grab some wax, and let‚Äôs make some light together‚Äîboth literally and metaphorically!",1,1746104492.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Title: First date went well, but he wants to explore other people‚Äîlooking for advice

Hi everyone,

I went on a date today with a guy I‚Äôve been talking to for a little over a week. Overall, I think it went quite well‚Äîwe went to watch the sunset, talked about our lifestyles, and later grabbed coffee. It even started raining, and he held the umbrella for me, which I thought was really sweet.

There were a few quiet moments during the date where we didn‚Äôt have much to talk about, but I think that‚Äôs normal when you‚Äôre just getting to know someone. For context, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, so I‚Äôm still new to dating and trying to figure things out as I go.

Toward the end of the date, we talked about what we‚Äôre both looking for. He told me he wants to meet new people and explore more after getting out of a past relationship. On the other hand, I feel like I‚Äôd prefer to focus on one connection at a time, and I‚Äôm interested in seeing where things could go between us.

Later, I tried to clarify things with him, and he said he‚Äôll keep talking to me if I want him to‚Äîwhich left me feeling a bit unsure.

I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this. Is it worth continuing to talk to him, knowing he‚Äôs not ready to be exclusive? Or should I just step back and move on? Would love to hear others‚Äô thoughts or experiences!",1,1746104468.0,Bumble,3,0.99,False

Ask and you shall receive Abby. And just to let you know I‚Äôm still not going to date anyone until it‚Äôs summer im going to wait for you even though it‚Äôll be very damaging and not healthy for me. I‚Äôm going to hold on to the hope I have and maybe with your situationship being gone and school going in brake is when it‚Äôll work. I know it‚Äôs very unlikely, but I have faith that lightning could strike. And at least I can die knowing it for sure wouldn‚Äôt work. And you can‚Äôt convince me not to wait for you. I will wait even if there‚Äôs no chances of us being a thing. I‚Äôve already put so much at stake within my own heart and I know you might not even care but I do. And I‚Äôll wait. I will wait.

i didn‚Äôt respond after he sent me that. I met this guy 3 weeks ago and we hit it off. We have been talking almost every single day after we met but I made it clear I don‚Äôt get into relationships quickly. And I made it very clear. He is much more religious than I am and I respect that but he‚Äôs been shoving it down my throat and shoving down the idea we need to get into a relationship now. The ‚Äúcoffee date‚Äù ya I never agreed to I said wasn‚Äôt sure I can go and i wasn‚Äôt able to go. For my birthday party I told all my friends I DONT NEED A GIFT and I made it very clear.

Told myself I would eat at supper on Tuesday unless I felt fine. Turned out it was easy to carry on and just break my fast in the morning of Wednesday.

Doing my second fast today and I feel super optimistic. I‚Äôm hoping to lose weight and prevent future diabetes my dad has it and I‚Äôve been struggling with my weight most of my life. I also love that it means I can more or less eat how I like on my eating days. I still track everything to make sure I‚Äôm getting all my macros and not going crazy. 

About a month ago I started Ozempic to support my attempt to lose weight and I feel like it helps with fasting because it stops food noise and helps suppress appetite.

I‚Äôm still using some of the training wheels Megan Ramos suggested in her book. I added 1tbs unsweetened coconut milk and 1tbs creamer to my massive thermos of iced coffee. I‚Äôm working toward drinking black coffee. I also have flavoured sparkling water and lots of sugar-free teas to get me through.

Some of my friends don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm doing this, and I know my family wouldn‚Äôt understand but it feels like I‚Äôm really in control. Reading through this subreddit has given me so much optimism for this method",2,1746104284.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

Kiroi: Probably not much longer now.

Shiryu: You‚Äôve been saying that for the last three hours.

Kiroii: Patience is a virtue

Makoto: It‚Äôs not like you have anywhere to be. Besides we need the Trigger for Kayla‚Äôs‚Ä¶ ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.

Shiryu: And you know who's dealing the trigger?

Makoto: Does it matter? **She scooted closer to her brother to warm up.**

Shiryu: **He draped his arm around her, pulling her close to keep her warm** Just asking

**Just then a van pulled up, followed by a car. A boar man with a thick Scottish accent came out of the van carting a large black crate. At the front was a man with an extremely wide neck, and on top an unattractive face that is set most apart by his big, bulbous nose.**

Kiroii: **He sat up, watching the men get out of the van with the crate** Guess that's our guy.

Makoto: Shiryu carry me down and get us closer, we need that trigger.

Shiryu: **He picks her up, setting her on his back as he gets off the roof** Careful now

Makoto: Aren‚Äôt I always?

Shiryu: **He sets her down, watching the men work to get the crate inside** Yeah yeah‚Ä¶

**The Scottish boar pried open the crate and surely enough there were vials of Trigger lined up. The drunkard pushed it towards the buyers.**

Kiroii: **He was looking at the crate through his binoculars, keeping a close eye on the situation** There it is

Makoto: Green light. **Shiryu drew back his arm and pointed his forward hand like a gun as he made a fire arrow and shot the Scottish boar.**

Kiroii: **He watched as the men were stunned at the sudden attack. In an instant several of them whipped out guns** Well it's game on now‚Ä¶

**Makoto and Shiryu came out of the shadows, Makoto threw a trash can at the drunkard while Yuyake came from the other side and kicked him down. Just then the Scottish boar got up with a singed vest.**

Kiroii: **He fired his gun at the men, but the bullets bounced off of them for some reason. He looked at the men with a curious look on his face** What the hell‚Ä¶

**One of them got bigger and growled viciously as his skin turned purple and the other one crystallized his skin.** Makoto: Oh right‚Ä¶Trigger junkies. Shiryu be a dear and‚Äî

Shiryu: **He put up his arms in defense as he looked a bit startled by the sudden mutation** Are you sure you want me to go up against that?

Makoto: Oh don‚Äôt be so dramatic.

Shiryu: **He looked at her like she was crazy** This isn't something to joke about‚Ä¶

**The two men started heading towards them as they looked more like monsters than anything.** Makoto: Who says I‚Äôm joking? **She ducked under the Bruiser and shot him in the stomach several times. Shiryu caught the crystal guy and surprised him with a head butt.**

**In the distance they heard police sirens coming. Makoto tries to make a run for the Trigger when the Scottish boar jumps in front of her.**

I‚Äôm gonna rip yer fookin‚Äô head off!

Makoto: Charming, I don‚Äôt have time to play.

**The Scottish boar was getting very pissed** Don't you come near my trigger, ya wee twat!

**He stomped on a glass bottle and kicked the shards at her. She dodged just in time to see him try kicking her, shattering the wall behind her.** Makoto: Steel-toed shoes, tricky bastard.

The boar: **He was very pissed now, he was literally foaming at the mouth** Yer got some sass t'yer mouth but yer going to regret it!

**Makoto darted forward and interrupted his talking with a punch to the nose heavier than someone her size should be capable of.**

The boar: **He stumbled back as he clutched his nose. He was in pain but still furious** Ya gonna pay for that!

**He goes for another wide swing but Makoto grabbed his arm, breaks his elbow and dislocated his shoulder. Then as he was falling she brought up her leg and slammed her boot into his chin.**

The boar: Fookin' little brat!

**He was seriously hurt. He tried to stand but he was in too much pain to do anything**

Makoto: Looks like it hurts, why don‚Äôt I put you to sleep? **She hits one last surprise punch to the lower jaw that made him stumble back. Yuyake came up behind him and lifted his semiconscious body over her shoulder into the dumpster. Shiryu was done too and already grabbing the Trigger.**

Kiroii: **He was already grabbing a few of the vials** You are just like your dad‚Ä¶

Makoto: You say that like it‚Äôs a bad thing. Let‚Äôs go!

Kiroii: **He followed behind her, keeping a close eye on the vial in his hands** What do you plan to do with this anyway?

Makoto: Call it insurance‚Ä¶ **The four of them made their escape just as the cops arrived.**

***

**They entered the large marble cavern where a lab once stood.** Makoto: Kayla? We‚Äôre here!

Kayla: **She was sitting on the floor by a computer monitor. She looked up as the four of them entered** Took you long enough

**Makoto ran up and threw her arms around the Nomu, who immediately stood up with the girl hanging from her neck.**

Kayla: What, you missed me or something?

Makoto: Very funny and Dad said you had a stick up your ass. Now where are your other Nomu?

Kayla: They're down in the testing cells. **She motioned to a set of double doors to her left**

**Surely enough there were five operational Nomu in there own separate cubicles. A creepy red eyed one with mouths on his shoulders, one with the face of a hammerhead shark, a draconic quadruped, a docile skull faced one, and one with a bulldog snout.**

Kayla: **She moved to the computer and turned it on, the screen had pictures of the Nomu on it** Go on, look them over

Makoto: Kiroii, you got the devices ready?

Kiroii: Yeah everything's set, this is gonna be easy.

Makoto: Speak for yourself, you get the easy part. Shiryu and I have the hard part‚Ä¶

Shiryu: Yep, can't wait.

**Kenzo woke up as Okuri next to his wife Camie when he got a call about a drug deal gone wrong.** Okuri: Give me a freakin‚Äô break‚Ä¶

Camie: **she was a bit dazed as she spoke** What's goin' on?

Okuri: Drug bust I guess, they called me for whatever reason. 

Camie: A bunch of druggies causing problems, how great.

Okuri: I‚Äôll be right back‚Ä¶ **He went over to the crib their youngest Mazu slept in.**

**The infant looked up to him with a look on her face that resembled a mixture of curiosity and confusion. She was trying to make a sound but only a slight whine left her mouth**

Okuri: I won‚Äôt be gone long little imp. **He lightly pinched her cheek as she turned in her sleep.**
***

**Okuri floated onto the crime scene where Uravity and Nighthide were already there.** Okuri: Well this is a shit show.

Uraraka: Damn it, how is this still such an issue?!

Okuri: What, having a hard time with a Mineta once again?

Uraraka: Don't remind me, this is getting too damn repetitive.

Shinsou: I recall you helping with that.

Okuri: Shove it. **He sips his coffee and walks onto the scene. Kids certainly left a mess behind.**

**The ground was littered with broken glass, empty containers, shattered vials, and other assorted objects, there was even a car that had been flipped over as well**

**The dealer had signs of blunt force trauma and his muscle was found in a dumpster with his arm broken in two places and a fractured jaw. The clients were immediately ID‚Äôd as frequent Trigger junkies.**

**The police officers were still on the scene, some had already called for a clean-up crew to deal with the cleanup. There was a few of the officers talking to each other, clearly in slight disbelief and annoyance at the whole situation**

Okuri: I‚Äôll give these kids credit, they certainly know how to leave a mess behind. Honestly Mineta would be proud.

Uraraka: Yeah‚Ä¶he would be‚Ä¶

Okuri: Is that regret I‚Äôm hearing from you, knowing what you did when he apologized? A bit late to feel bad about it don‚Äôt ya think? **He knelt down and nudged a bit of sludge on the ground with a pen.**

Uraraka:Can you just bring Kenzo or literally anyone else out?

Okuri: Hm your loss. **His body jolted and his eyes changed from teal to a deep purple while the sclera became dark pits.**

Shinsou: What the fu-?!

Uraraka: Kory≈´ sitrep.

Kory≈´: Four assailants, ambush, departure approximately two hours ago. Narcotics missing, likely confiscated by the third party.

Shinsou: Alright, let's head out.

Kory≈´: Warning-Local dispatch has reported two attacks in Naruhata and Kamino districts. Designation‚Ä¶Nomu.

Shinsou: A nomu attack?! What the hell!

Uraraka: I thought we got them all!

Kory≈´: Query update- more Nomu are appearing around Mustafu.

Shinsou: Dammit! I need to head back to my shop then!

Uraraka: WHAT?!

**In a flash of dark light, Kenzo took off like a rocket and blasted towards the scene. While doing so he made calls to his old classmates in the Kamino and Naruhata regions to check the disturbances.**

**He arrived in Mustafa pretty quickly. He looked around, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Surely enough he encountered one of the Nomu, but the strange thing was it was oddly‚Ä¶docile.**

**He carefully approached the Nomu, still on his guard in case it were to suddenly attack. Nevertheless, the creature made no attempt to harm him and only stood still, watching him approach**

Kenzo: This is Darkstar, report on your Nomu encounters. Kamino what is your status?

**The line connected and Kenzo was immediately met with the sound of shouting and chaos**

Ojiro: A dragon Nomu torching the place from the rooftops! Mizuki‚Äôs chasing and Sear is trying to snuff out the flames until rescuers get here!

**The commotion was so loud that Kenzo could faintly hear the sounds of explosions and screams in the background. It took a moment for him to process the current situation on the other end of the line**

Kenzo: I‚Äôll be there momentarily‚Ä¶ **Out of the corner of his eye he spotted a nomu identical to the one in front of him. Strange‚Ä¶he went to call Naruhata to see how they were doing.**

**As he called, he was soon greeted by the sound of chaos on the other end of the line, there was yelling, explosions, and what appeared to be gunfire. Kenzo couldn't make out what the voices were saying due to all of the noise that was taking place**

Kenzo: Kirishima, what‚Äôs going on over there?

Kirishima: Everything is going to hell! We just got two heroes in critical condition by a Nomu and Ginger‚Äôs holding it back!

Kenzo: I‚Äôll be there as soon as possible. **He pulls out a syringe and sticks it into the Nomu‚Äôs shoulder.**

**The Nomu let out some confused sounds but otherwise didn't try and make any attempt to fight him off as he stuck it with the syringe**

**He ran a quick DNA test on it and found that some of its genetic information had originated from the deceased villain twice. But how?**
***

**Makoto sat on the outskirts of the forested area surrounding U.A high school, looking upon the source of her father‚Äôs misery. She felt Kodashi nudge her curled up form, the Nomu‚Äôs empty sockets peering down at her.** Makoto: Not now‚Ä¶

Kodachi: **He growled in annoyance at being brushed off**

Makoto: I know I shouldn‚Äôt be here but I have to do this. **She scratches his chin as he hums curiously.**

Kodachi: **He leaned into her touch, closing his eyes happily as she continued to pet him**

Makoto: Fuckin‚Äô hate this place‚Ä¶this is where everything went to shit for Dad. *sigh* He really thought he could be happy here, with the closest friends he ever had.

Kodachi: **He growled in sympathy, resting his head against her lap to comfort her**

Makoto: Hey hey, you‚Äôre too big to try to fit in my lap! Stawhp.

Kodachi: **He continued to rest his head on her lap stubbornly, not feeling like moving any time soon**

**She sighed and laid down on her back.** Makoto: What am I doing‚Ä¶

Shiryu: Hey Toxin and Hammerhead are ready to g‚Äîwhat are you doing? **She looks over at her brother walking out of the clearing.**

Makoto: **She sat up quickly, startled by his sudden entrance**

Damn, Shiryu give a girl a heads up if you're going to sneak up on her like that.

Shiryu: Second thoughts?

Makoto: **She quickly shook her head**

No no, I was just thinking is all‚Ä¶don't worry about it.

Shiryu: Don‚Äôt worry, I am too‚Ä¶

Makoto: About what?

Shiryu: Doing this‚Ä¶coming here to where everything went wrong with Dad.

Makoto: Oh‚Ä¶yeah, that makes sense.

**He knelt down and wiped her cheek and she winced.** Shiryu: You have a cut on your face.

Makoto: **She pulled back slightly after he touched her**

It's just a little scratch, I'm fine. Must‚Äôve happened when that boar guy kicked glass at me‚Ä¶

Shiryu: How much longer can we keep this up‚Ä¶

**She stayed silent, unsure of how to properly answer his question as they both knew time wasn't on their side**

Makoto: Let‚Äôs hurry up, Kodachi stay out here and keep watch.

Kodachi: **He seemed a bit disappointed that he would have to stay outside but he nonetheless stayed by his side. Though he did look annoyed at being left outside where it was cold**

**Just then Hammerhead Nomu came out of the ground. Carrying them ahead it permeated through the ground. If the schedule they commandeered was any good, the lunch period lasted an hour from 12:30-1:30. Luckily they made two copies of their Dad‚Äôs old school ID so they wouldn‚Äôt trip the UA barrier.**

**The lunch period was in full swing throughout the campus as it was the time all the students would take a break to eat. Some hung out in the commons, while other's sat in private areas to be left alone. The cafeteria was crowded with people moving to and from their seats to get food. Students were all chatting with whatever they could about the various topics that were currently hot at the time**

Makoto: Let‚Äôs split up and look for this decryption key in one of Dad‚Äôs homeroom classes. You look in class 1-A and I‚Äôll check class 2-A.

**They broke off in different directions as they made their way to their respective homerooms. The halls were packed with students and teachers, the atmosphere was bustling with all sorts of commotion. It made it hard to focus properly as the halls were almost too crowded**

**She pulls her hat down over her hair so no one would be suspicious of her. This place could‚Äôve been the best days of Dad‚Äôs life, instead it was hell.**

**She continued making her way through the halls, sticking out like a sore thumb due to the fact that her attire was so clearly not a student's attire. She attracted a few weird looks as she passed by other students but she paid no mind. Her main focus was to get to class 2-A undetected so she could look for the decryption key**

**She was so caught up in her thoughts that she bumped into an absolute wall of a woman. She looked up towards a fierce looking woman with eyes like a serpent who was big enough to break her in half.**

**The woman stood at least three heads taller than her, towering over her small figure as she looked down on her in annoyance. There was a short moment of pure silence before the giant woman spoke out, her deep voice echoing through her thoughts**

Woman: Watch it, pipsqueak.

Makoto: Yeah okay! **She squeaked out as she tried to slip past her and her posse when another wall of muscle impeded her.** Oh my god you can grind meat on it‚ÄîAAH! 

**The boy stood a good four or five heads taller than her, his wings stretched out from his back as he also looked down on her with a sense of annoyance on his face**

Boy: Who are you, and what are you doing here? You clearly don't go to this school.

Makoto: Of course I do, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶coming back from work study!

Boy: You're way too small to be a student here! **He leaned in and grabbed her chin, pulling her closer to look at her up close**

**He quickly let's go as she smacks his hand away as he takes a slight step back. He seems a bit surprised by her reaction to him as he responds**

Boy: You're feisty aren't you?

Makoto: And you‚Äôve never had someone talk back to you. **She pushes past them, they were about to say something to her but a girl with wild eyes and blue hair stopped them. She didn‚Äôt have time for idle chit chat, it wouldn‚Äôt be long before the staff notices a dead student in the system.**

**As she slides open the door, she‚Äôs immediately thrown into a memory of her Dad‚Äôs last week at UA.**

**He had just finished destroying his desk by bashing it to smithereens, he stood there in the middle of the mess with a frustrated look on his face**

**She reached out,wanting to wrap her arms around her father and finally be the one to ease his pain. But this wasn‚Äôt real, just an old memory that didn‚Äôt belong to her‚Ä¶**

**There clearly wasn‚Äôt any data here, it‚Äôs best that she‚Äî** Makoto? **She jumped out of her skin as she heard someone call her name. She turned around to find her foster sister standing there, holding a trapper keeper in her trembling hands.** Hatori: Mako?

**She was startled as Hatori called out to her, she turned around to find Hatori standing there in the doorway. Her eyes widened in surprise as she saw the look on her face; the nervousness, the anxiety, it was all clear as day on her little sister's features.**

Makoto: H-Hatori?!

**She watched in surprise as her familiar wrapped her arms around her. A pang of guilt washed over her as she saw the look in Hatori's eyes, the fear and worry that she couldn't help but notice**

Makoto: H-Hatori...

***BOOM***

**The last thing she heard before she was thrown outside.**

**She was launched out of the classroom through the broken front door, landing heavily on the ground on her side on the grass outside.**
 Makoto: No‚Ä¶
***
**Thirty minutes earlier, class 1-A sat together at lunchtime to discuss their developments.**
Chihiro: Akari‚Äôs been acting weird, mom says she‚Äôs taking him to a therapist before he gets worse.

Kita: Is that right? What sort of things has he been doing?

Chihiro: Talking in his sleep and surreal drawings. He‚Äôs been really intense lately too. 

Akumu: Talking in his sleep, huh? That's pretty concerning. Maybe he's got something deep going on underneath the surface. And the drawings, maybe they're a reflection of something he's bottling up or afraid of letting out?

Daisuke: Maybe he‚Äôs traumatized by the Army of Stain kidnapping him. 

Nazareth: That's definitely a possibility. Trauma can take many forms and manifest in strange ways. Talking in his sleep and drawing surreal images could be his subconscious trying to make sense of his experience. He might be trying to process and make peace with what happened.

Sophie: Whatever‚Ä¶ **Sophie had just been discharged from the hospital and sitting on her boyfriend‚Äôs lap. Yuu Hogo, the illegitimate surrogate son of the long dead villain Dabi, had been a part of their friend group for a while now and one of the only ones who could rein her in.**

Yuu: Hmph, don't be so dismissive. She's probably right about that. Traumatic experiences can leave deep scars. It's important for him to talk to someone if he's struggling.

Sophie: You still talking about the grape runt? I got sucker punched‚Ä¶

Yuu: So you got hit? That doesn't mean you can ignore the impact of his trauma. People deal with things in different ways, some are better at keeping their emotions bottled up than others.

Sophie: Yeah sure‚Ä¶ **She pokes at her spicy curry as Toshinori looks at her with a worried expression. He‚Äôs known Sophie since they were in diapers and not once has she ever been so quiet.**

Yuu: Come on, you know better than to act like what you're going through doesn't matter. Everyone here cares about you, you don't have to go through this alone.

Sophie: I need to take a piss. **She gets up and walks out of the cafeteria. Toshi feels someone poke him in the side and looks over at Harumi eating yakiniku through her scarf. She signs to him *`Sophie. Be. Okay?`***

Toshi: Yeah, I know she's not doing good, I'm a little worried about her too. I've known her for a long time and it's not like her to act like this. I'll keep an eye on her.

**Harumi hummed curiously at the response. That‚Äôs when Hime came and ruffled the tall girl‚Äôs hair.** 
Hime: Aww classic ‚ÄòRumi, always looking out for the little guy.

Hahena: I think everyone is a little guy to her Hime.

**Hime continued to ruffle up Harumi's hair as she spoke, giggling with the rest of the group as they teased Harumi.**

Yuu: Classic Harumi, always oblivious to sarcasm.

**As they continue their teasing of Harumi, Hime feeding her pork cutlets, Toshinori sees himself out of the cafeteria. He needed to have a chat with his Dad.**

***
**He soon found him in a classroom grading papers.**

**Toshinori stood in the doorway for a moment, watching his father sit at his desk as he reviewed papers. He took a deep breath, steeling himself before finally speaking up**

Toshinori: Dad? Can I talk to you for a bit?

Deku: Hm, sure Toshi, please sit down. **To say having your parent as a teacher is awkward was putting it lightly.** So what‚Äôs on your mind?

**Toshi took a seat in front of his father, crossing one leg over the other and fidgeting nervously with his hands.**

Toshi: I actually had something I wanted to talk to you about.

**His father noticed his son's nervousness and gave him a look that urged him to go ahead.**

Deku: Go on, what is it, son.

Toshi: Why did you kill Minoru Mineta?

**His father seemed caught off guard by the question, he was not expecting that.**

Deku: What? Where did you hear that?

Toshi: Is that a yes?

Deku: **He rubbed the bridge of his nose, realizing that denial would get him nowhere. He let out a quiet sigh before speaking again.**

...yes, I killed him.

Toshi: Why though, you hesitated to kill Tomura Shigaraki and Mom did the same for Himiko Toga. And you both felt awful afterwards when they died anyway. Why was Mineta any different?

Deku: **He let his eyes look away awkwardly, struggling to find the words to answer his son's question.**

It's...complicated, Toshi.

Toshi: But he was your friend, why didn‚Äôt you try to reason with him like you did the villains? He didn‚Äôt even commit the crime he was accused of and you still killed him?

Deku: It's not that simple, Toshi‚Ä¶ **He could feel his son's anger and disappointment. The question hit a nerve and he was struggling to keep his emotions in check.**

Trust me, it wasn't an easy choice.

Toshi: That‚Äôs not enou‚Äî ***BOOM***

**An explosion rocked the building and knocked both Midoriya‚Äôs out of their seats.**

Deku: What the‚Äî?! 

**He stumbled back a bit from the sudden explosion, quickly regaining his footing as he looked around the room for the cause.**

**They both ran out into the hallway that was now filled with smoke and screaming students.** There‚Äôs a bomb!

Deku: God damn it‚Ä¶ **He shielded his face from the smoke with one arm, trying to keep his bearings and find his bearings in the chaos.** 

Where the hell is the source?!

**Toshi ran ahead of his Dad to go find his class. Being class representative has its requirements, being there to protect everyone during a crisis was the bare minimum of his responsibilities.**

Deku: Wait!! Where the hell are you going? 

**He called out after his son but was cut off when another explosion shook the building. He stumbled a bit and shook his head to clear his vision. Quickly regaining his bearings, he called back after his son.**

Don't go charging in there on your own!

**Toshi pushed through the crowded hall of teenagers toward the source of the smoke. He spotted a couple of his classmates up ahead trying to navigate the chaos.**

**As Toshi approached, his classmates, who were all currently trying to find a route away from the smoke, took notice of him and looked towards him in relief.**

Chihiro: **Shouted** Oh good, you're here. We're trying to find a way out.

Hime: **Hissed** This is such a damn mess‚Ä¶

Toshi:Guys what happened?!

Chihiro: Some damn villain snuck in and set off explosives. We're trying to find a way out.

Hime: God damn terrorists‚Ä¶

**Toshi's eyes were drawn to a trembling Harumi huddled against the wall, her hands pressed over her ears. He recognized her immediately and jogged over to her.**

Harumi! **He called out to her as he approached.** Hey, it's okay. It's okay, I've got you now.

Toshi: Can you throw me that way? The others can help you get away from the noise. **Her rubbed gentle circles on her back as he pointed towards the source.**

**Harumi looked back at the hallway with the explosions and the smoke, fear and uncertainty clear on her face. She was clearly terrified but seemed to trust in Toshi to keep her safe in that moment.**

**She looked behind to him and gave him a shaky nod, wrapping her arms around him and holding on tightly. Toshi scooped her up in his arms with ease, holding her close as he made his way through the chaos.**

Toshi: Okay just warn me befo‚ÄîOOOORE! **He didn‚Äôt get time to prepare as she flung him down the hall.**

**The sudden release caught Toshi off guard and he was flung down the hallway, bouncing slightly across the floor before he finally hit a wall with a thud. He sat up and grunted in pain as he rubbed the side of his head.**

God damn it‚Ä¶

**He dusted himself off and got closer to the epicenter of the blast zone. He could swear he heard something up ahead.** No no no, this wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen.

**Toshi stepped closer to the center of the explosions, trying to peer through the smoke and chaos. He was on high alert, and it seemed his intuition was correct. He could feel a presence, something or someone was still down here.**

**He moved up some more and standing ahead was the girl he saw on the news, Makoto Mineta.**

**Toshi was both confused and concerned as he spotted her. She looked distressed and on edge, and the situation was tense enough as it was. He carefully stepped forward, keeping his guard up in case she was still a threat.**

Hey, you okay?

**She turned around and looked at him like a deer in headlights as she started to panic.** Makoto: It wasn‚Äôt me, I-I swear! I-I didn‚Äôt do any of this, you have to believe me!

**Toshi held up his hands in a sign of peace, trying to calm her down.** Hey, hey, easy there. It's okay, I believe you. I know you didn't do any of this.

Makoto: I‚Äôm not falling for that trap, I won‚Äôt let you all drag me like they did my father! 
**Just then a jet of flame came and separated the two of them. Toshi was thrown back into a wall, knocking him unconscious. Makoto on the other hand was left alone with a towering figure shrouded by smoke.**

Makoto: You won‚Äôt take us! **Makoto ran for the exit, jumping out of the exit hole made by the first explosion. She made a break for the UA forest, Toxin‚Äôs gas should be keeping any reinforcements from coming in. She needed to contact her brother and fast!** Shiryu wherever you are hurry to the rendezvous!

**The forest was silent, almost eerily so. There was no one around and the only sound was the quiet hum of the night. As Makoto ran through the trees, her footsteps crunching through the underbrush, she had only one thought on her mind.**

**Suddenly, she heard something in the distance, a quiet rustling sound. Someone, or something, was watching her.**

Makoto: Shiryu? Kodachi? **Silence** Hammerhead? Toxin?

**The silence was deafening. There was no response, no reply of acknowledgment. The only sound was the rustling, the rustling that seemed to be getting closer and closer to where she was standing.**

**She was starting to get nervous, and a feeling of discomfort washed over her. She felt like she wasn't alone, that someone or something was watching her, stalking her through the trees waiting for the right moment.**

**That‚Äôs when she gets the feeling something was behind her. She drew her knife and turned around fast‚Ä¶only to find something that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible.** Makoto: M-Mom? 

**That‚Äôs right, standing there before her eyes was Kaori Neo, her deceased mother in the flesh.**

**Tears welled up in her eyes as she tried to process what she was seeing. Her dead mother, standing before her in the flesh, like a vision from a long forgotten dream.**

Mom..? **She breathed out, her voice cracking with emotion.**

Kaori: Hey sugar pea. 

**The words hit Makoto like a punch to the gut. Her mother's voice, dry and strained, filled the air. She could hardly believe it. This couldn't be real, this had to be a dream, right?**

Mom, is that really you? **Her voice was shaky and emotional, her eyes filled with tears as she looked at her mother.**

Kaori: I‚Äôll explain later but right now we have to go.

**Makoto's mind was racing, a million questions running through her mind. But her mother's urgency and the situation at hand had her immediately agreeing.**

Okay, okay, where do we go? **She asked, her voice still laced with disbelief.**

**Her mother reaches out to her when Kodachi shows up at the worst possible time. The Nomu throws a wild haymaker at her mom.** Makoto: Mom! Kodachi stop it!

**Kodachi's appearance was sudden and unexpected, and it was even more shocking as he attacked her mother. Makoto yelled, desperate to intervene, but it was too late. The blow hit her mother and she was sent sprawling backwards, the force of the hit catching her completely off guard.**

**Just then Kodachi hissed at something behind her as her mother stood up and made her way to them. Kodachi‚Äôs skin hardened as he belched white flames that she narrowly avoided.**

**The flames hit the trees behind them, igniting them and causing a small forest fire. Despite the chaos around her, Makoto was completely fixated on her mother, watching her every move. She was so overwhelmed that she was struggling to think straight.**

Mom, what is happening? What's going on? **She asked, her voice filled with desperation and confusion.**

Kaori: Hold on a sec‚Äô **She held up a finger as she transforms into an oni, complete with horns barrel arms and fangs. She towered over her daughter as she palmed Kodachi with one hand.**

M-mom?  **She managed to stutter out, her voice barely a whisper.**

**Makoto sat motionless in her mother's grasp, speechless and stunned. She was still reeling from the transformation she had seen, completely out of her comfort zone. But now, as her mother took her away from U.A., she couldn't help but feel a sense of fear and uncertainty.**

Where are we going? **She managed to ask, her voice trembling slightly.**

Kaori: *Away from here‚Ä¶* **Her voice was now raspy as she landed on the outskirts of UA.**

**Makoto's heart was racing, and she was still trying to process everything that had happened. As her mother landed, she took in their surroundings, the forest around them was quiet and peaceful, nothing like the chaos they had just left behind at U.A.**

We're far away now, but why did you have to take me away? **She asked, her voice still shaky and uncertain.**

**Kaori changed back as she grabbed her daughter‚Äôs arm and pulled her towards a van that pulled up.**

**Makoto followed her mother, her mind still racing as they walked towards the van. As she climbed inside, she glanced out the window, trying to get a better idea of where they were going.**

Where are you taking me? **She asked again, her voice a mixture of confusion and fear.**

Kaori: Don‚Äôt worry about it. **Was all her mother said before the door swung open and sitting there was her brother with his hands tied and‚Ä¶her‚Ä¶father. Minoru Mineta was standing there idly staring at her.**

**At the sight of her brother tied up, Makoto froze in shock.**

**She turned to look at her mother, her eyes wide and her breath caught in her throat.**

M-mom, what is going on?? **She asked, her voice cracking and filled with disbelief. The fact that both her father and brother were here, tied up and confused, only added to her confusion and fear.**

**Before she could turn around, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck. A gasp burst from her lips as she felt her mother squeeze the air from her lungs. Tears fell from her eyes as it dawned on her that her own mother was choking her.** 

**She was completely caught off guard, the shock and pain overwhelming her.**

**She clutched at her throat, desperately trying to loosen her mother's grip, but it only seemed to make her tighten it more.**

Please, stop! I can't breathe!!  **She pleaded, her voice hoarse and desperate.**

Kaori: Shhhhhh‚Ä¶

**The sound of her voice, cold and detached, sent chills down Makoto's spine. She was struggling to breathe, her airway closing off as her mother's grip tightened even further.**

Please, ma, stop! You're hurting me! **She choked out, her voice ragged and weak.**

**She felt her mother lower her to the ground as someone else stepped from the van, a tall hooded figure with a mist- like aura and someone else she recognized‚Ä¶Phoenix tree was the last thing that appeared in her mind. And then‚Ä¶something clicked. Her eyes widened in horror, the realization sinking in: she was in the presence of her enemies, the people who had ruined her family.**

Makoto: Ma‚Ä¶ma‚Ä¶ **Then everything went dark.**",4,1746104106.0,ChurchOfMineta,1,1.0,False

1kc7ypo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1kc7ypo/personal_chef_advice_for_prepping/,Personal Chef Advice for Prepping,"Hi everyone. I wanted to share a few things that I myself am doing and you may find useful too in the coming weeks/months. Some of this was based on my nubile cooking skills during covid when I prepped then - however after investing more of my time into how to make foods from scratch and/or using the raw ingredients I want to share some advice from my world. 

  
1. Food Safety - if you don't have a food themometer - look at getting one, and being aware of what safe levels to cook your food/meat at to prevent disease. Additionally, ServSafe rule of thumb is that prepared foods need to be eaten within the week. You can however freeze food you dont eat, and that stops the clock. I do this frequently (I like a few different cuisines a week but always end up making a bit more than what is needed). 

2. Consider alternative cooking methods - and I mean that if you have a propane grill (please use outside!) look at having your propane tank ready. Any sort of power outage still means you can have some grilled food for dinner (and if you dont have an automatic start, look at getting a some lighters as well). If you have an outdoor firepit, be sure that you have a secure dry spot for firewood. Be sure to check to see if there are any burn bans in your state/region prior to having a fire. 

3. Cooking Supplies I'm listing below my favorite items that I'm prepping this time around.

\-Cooking Oils. I mainly prefer using Avocado Oil (high smoke point, almost impossible to f it up and also has 0 taste), followed by Olive Oil (only for Mediterranian Cuisine - there are no olives in Asia!) and Butter. These can not only prep a skillet for frying, but also in creating marinades. I do keep a small container of vegetable oil for baking or frying if necessary. 

\- Spices. Your most common spices across all cuisines will be Salt (Kosher salt is optimal instead of table salt - reason why is that because the salt grains are not as fine, you have a lower chance of over salting your food. Still, be judicious when salting), Pepper, Garlic (fresh or Jarlic), Garlic Powder, Onion Powder. See below for additional spices that may or may not appeal to you and your preferences. **Note:** Using Spice Blends (Creole/Cajun, Lemon Pepper, etc)  can be a great and easy way to make a dish without having to do too much kitchen chemistry. However, be aware that many of them have ALOT of salt. That being said, be conservative with using any salt when using a spice blend (or wait to add salt at the end after tasting to see if its needed).

\* Cumin - typically used in Mexican, Middle Eastern and Indian Cuisines

\* Turmeric - used in Middle Eastern, Indian, Spanish and a few other cuisines. Also good for digestion. 

\*Cinnamon (Also consider Nutmeg) - while used as a warm sweetening spice, it is also used in Middle Eastern/North African dishes (just a dash) to provide some warmth. My favorite use is with schwarma. 

\*Paprika - I prefer the smoked version as this gives a nice smokey/rustic taste to foods. Also used in many international cuisines. 

\* Cayenne or other hot pepper spice powders - provides some heat - usually used in Mexican/Indian/Middle Eastern and Central/SE Asia cuisines

\*Ginger - this provides zesty taste to food and also is used alot in Indian/Asian Cuisines. Also good for digestion. 

Herbs (If you have the ability to have an herb garden, do it, otherwise, fresh is better than dried. Be sure to use only 1/3 of the fresh amount listed if you are using dried). 

\*Bay Leaves - great for stews and braising liquids

\*Thyme/Rosemary/Sage/Oregano - typically used in European dishes, provides a great herbal flavor. Typically also added while braising, stewing or sauteeing. 

\*Fennel - not the most popular of seeds but this can help settle an upset stomac. Fresh Mint also helps here too.

\*Cilantro/Parsley (flat leaf only, curly parsley is mostly for looks) - light springy flavor, usually used as a garnish but varies on cuisine/dish. 

\-Sauces/Liquids. Take a look at having a little of the following on hand. Lemon/Lime Juice. Soy/Tamarin/Liquid Aminos Sauce, Sesame Oil, White and Apple Cider Vinegars, Chili Crisp, Vanilla, Chicken/Veg/Beef Stock or Bouillon Cubes (the latter is more shelf stable and takes less room). More cuisine specific would be Basalmic Vinegar, Madiera Wine/Sherry Vinegar, Fish Sauce, Oyster+ Hoisin Sauces. Dont forget mustards, ketchup, hot sauce, mayonaise, worchester sauce, etc. **Note**: there are alot of ethnic sauces/spice kits available at most grocers now - from tikka masala, harissa, biryani, jerk, teriyaki, carne asada, etc. As a more inexperienced cook during Covid I used them frequently and it provided some great diversity during lockdowns. 

4. Food Items: Shelf Stable Foods I'm preparing this time around - And AGAIN These may not apply to you or your palate - if you dont eat it - dont buy it! These are shelf stable foods that do not require refridgeration prior to use. Always try to get low sodium versions if possible so you can control the spice/flavoring as best you can. In regards to beans and lentils - buy dried as they take up less room and are typically less expensive. The flip side is that you do need to soak these, sometimes overnight, prior to use.

\*Beans - Black/Pinto/Red - usually used in Latin American/Caribbean cuisines, along w/ Chili. Cannellini/Navy Beans are more used in Italian/EU cooking. 

\*Chick Peas - has gotten alot of popularity lately but is frequently used in Middle Eastern and Indian Cuisines. Full of protien and fiber. 

\*Lentils - this is something i only recently discovered that these lentils has as varied of a flavor profile between them just as beans do. I recently made a red and green lentil ragout for pasta a week ago and my carnivore brother had no idea, and went back for seconds and thirds. I also enjoy making indian dals (lentil soup). 

\* Canned tomatoes, tomato sauces, pastes - get generic non seasoned versions. This will allow you to cook with them as you want - whether its italian, mexican, indian or even in stews/braises. Passata sauce (usually in the italian section) is a great base to making your own pasta sauce. 

\* Canned Veg - corn, green beans, peas. Can be used for chili or even making shepherds pie or chicken pot pie. Canned corn can be added with diced tomato/onion/jalapeno/cilantro/lemon juice/salt for a easy pico de gallo. 

\* Canned Tuna - I personally can't handle canned chicken but I dont mind eating canned tuna and salmon - and its a great way to make fish cakes during the summer (combined w/ bread crumbs, seasonings).

\* Insta Mashed Potates - great food item - just have to add water. Not only can you use as directed, sometimes if you need to thicken a stew you can add a spoonful or two to the broth and it will thicken. I recommend getting any flavors you like, but also a generic bland version so you can season as you see fit. 

\* Pickles/Olives/Capers/Pickled Peppers - these are shelf stable foods that while great on a charcuterie board, can also enhance dishes. Pickles can be added to tuna salad, and olives are used in Moroccan Dishes (tagine) and even some italian dishes (see Pasta Puttanesca).  

\*Pasta - spaghetti, lasagna, bowtie, rotini. Also gluten free options now too! Always cook your pasta 1-2 min less than the recommended time as residual cooking will still occur. Additionally, save a cup or so of pasta water and add to the pasta sauce (tbsp by tbsp) to assist with taste/texture. When cooking pasta for a soup - don't put the pasta in the stew but keep it on the side and only add when serving (even store it in a different container). This will help the pasta from becoming soggy in your soup and ruining the texture.

\* Rice - I prefer the raw rice as opposed to insta rice, as its not processed- but I won't knock Rice a Roni or other boxed rice varietals - they make it easy to make a meal. Be sure to rinse your raw rice at least 3 times prior to use. Rice is used in a variety of cuisines and ways- not only as dirty rice, spanish rice, risotto, and pilaf. Consider using bouillon instead of water when cooking raw rice to increase flavor. Add spices/herbs to enhance and differentiate depending on what cuisine you're making. 

\*Applesauce, Other dried fruits(apricot/prune/raisin/date/fig). Applesauce can be used as an egg equivalent when baking (1/4 cup applesauce = 1 egg). Dried fruits can be used in salads but also in middle eastern/north african/indian cuisines, and as a snack. 

\*Jello - great to have for kids as they like it. I usually dont cook with it but grabbed a few for my nieces/nephew. Also see Jelly/Peanut/Nut Butter; insta-cake mixes. 

\*Popcorn/Almonds/Nuts/Seeds - easy low space snack. Also nuts can be used as a garnish in many plates/salads. Can combine to make trailmix for kids.

\*Coffee/Sugar or other Sweetners/Cocoa/Chocolate/Shelf Stable Milk/Baking Powder/Baking Soda/Corn Starch - last generic group of items that can be used for baking (I'm not too much of a baker) but still can be used from time to time. Baking soda and Vinegar can be great to clean pots with (although my favorite is Bar Keepers Friend for tough spots). 

5. Tips if you F up. We all make mistakes while cooking - and here are some helpful ones to consider. 

 \* If you're using flour to thicken a sauce/soup - (first of all  make a slurry so you dont have flour chunks)  make sure you bring the soup to boiling and then reduce back down to a simmer. This will cook the flour and prevent you from having a flour taste. I personally prefer to use a cornstarch slurry (1 tbsp cornstarch 2 tbsp water) and add to simmering soup/sauces. 

\*Not only can a tbsp or 2 of  potato startch/insta mashed potatoes help thicken a soup/stew, but so can 1-2 tbsp of tomato paste (consider only using tomato paste in stews/soups that already have tomatoes in it).

\* Over salt your soup? Drop in half a potato and simmer for 30 min\~. I have also added potato starch that helped as well but if you're not looking to thicken the soup just look at adding half a potato. Also look at adding a dash of an acid at the end (i.e. Lemon/Lime juice, Apple Cider Vinegar, Sherry Vinegar). 

\*When cooking something in butter but dont want your butter to burn? Add in a little bit of oil - that will increase the smoke point and prevent the milk solids in the butter from burning. 

\*Only cook/saute garlic for 30 seconds or so to prevent burning and developing a bitter taste. Most recipes are aware of this and will have you add stock/tomatoes/onions/etc as the next step that have additional liquid so the potential burning of garlic is reduced. If it doesn't, consider adding some stock or water after the thirty seconds so your garlic doesn't burn. 

\*Cutting onions make you cry? Light a candle near your prep station - it will burn the sulfur compounds onions release so you wont cry (as much).

\*Oil catch fire in your pan? 1- **Stay calm** and 2. put the lid on it. No air = no fire. Keep the lid on for at least 20-30 seconds and consider moving the pan to a cooler part of the stove and handle once its under control. Do not throw flour on fire as it will catch fire even more (had a roomie do that in college haha).

  
This is all I can think of for right now - but if I have others I'll post below. If other folks have cooking practices that they also enjoy or prepping ideas they're actively engaging in post below so we can all help each other out <3 ",38,1746103942.0,TwoXPreppers,11,0.97,False

Like right now,I have been quite productive with my weightloss journey and my finances.
I am more motivated to tackle my academics that I had abandoned for the past few weeks.I am watching and reading a lot of self help content and have been connecting again with God.

So 1)am I motivated or am I just going through an episode?and 2) is it a bad thing to take advantage of this energy?

Oh and for more context,I do OMAD(one meal a day) so I have a few cups of coffee a day,and I have cut down on sugar significantly so there's also that!

1kc7skj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kc7skj/my_own_death_came_to_me/,My own death came to me,"
I must be imagining things‚Ä¶ I have to be.

My name is Ashraf. I‚Äôm just like any young man in Egypt, a year or two past twenty-five, living alone in an old rent-controlled apartment in a sort of working-class neighborhood here in Cairo. I have a modest job, I go, I come back, one day like the one before it, nothing new. Loneliness can be suffocating sometimes, but you get used to it. Or maybe you just think you‚Äôve gotten used to it.

It started about a month ago‚Ä¶ or maybe a little longer, I don‚Äôt remember exactly. Very simple things at first, like what‚Ä¶ like feeling someone rushed past you, the corner of your eye catches a shadow that vanishes. Of course, the first thing that comes to mind: exhaustion, lack of sleep, the stress of work and this crappy life. I‚Äôd shake my head and tell myself, ""Man, get over it, you just need some good sleep.""

But it stopped being just fleeting shadows. I started to feel it more. Like what? Like you‚Äôre sitting watching TV, the volume low because of the neighbors, and suddenly you feel breath behind your neck. You whip around‚Ä¶ nothing. You turn off the TV and just listen‚Ä¶ complete silence, except for the hum of the old fridge in the kitchen and the sound of cars passing in the street. The next day, you find the wardrobe door slightly ajar, and you‚Äôre a million percent sure you closed it properly before sleeping. Little things that make you doubt yourself, make you wonder, maybe I'm the one forgetting? Maybe I'm just not focused?

I stayed like this for two or three weeks. Denying it, lying to myself, saying it‚Äôs just my imagination. Until the night I‚Äôll never forget.

I came back from work late, dead tired. I‚Äôd barely entered the apartment, tossed my keys on the table near the door, and was heading to the bathroom to take a shower to wake myself up. The bathroom in this apartment is a bit dark, its lightbulb is weak and flickers sometimes. I stood in front of the mirror to wash my face, the cold water hit my face and jolted me awake a bit. I lifted my head while drying my face with the towel‚Ä¶ and I saw him.

Standing behind me, near the bathroom door.

My heart dropped to my feet. The towel fell from my hand into the sink. I kept staring into the mirror, unable to turn around. He‚Ä¶ he looked like me. Roughly the same height, same short black hair, same facial features‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt me. His face was‚Ä¶ bloated. Swollen. Like someone who had drowned and been pulled from the water after two or three days. The skin was pale, stretched in a weird way, and his eyes‚Ä¶ his eyes were empty, staring at me in the mirror without any expression. He was wearing the same grey t-shirt I had worn that morning before leaving for work.

Seconds passed like hours. I was frozen in place, hearing my heartbeat pounding in my ears like a drum. The breath I‚Äôd felt behind my neck these past days‚Ä¶ it was him. The shadow I kept glimpsing‚Ä¶ it was him.

I gathered all my courage and spun around quickly.

No one.

The bathroom door was closed just as it was. The air in the bathroom felt suddenly cold; I felt a shiver run down my entire body. I looked back in the mirror again‚Ä¶ I was alone. My face in the mirror was yellow and drawn, my eyes wide with terror.

I left the bathroom, my legs stumbling over each other. I sat on the sofa in the living room, trying to process what I‚Äôd seen. Drowned? Looked like me? What nonsense is this? It must have been a dream; I was tired and exhausted and must have fallen asleep standing in front of the mirror. Yes, that‚Äôs the only logical explanation.

But the grey t-shirt? I took it off this morning and threw it in the laundry basket. I ran to the bedroom, opened the laundry basket‚Ä¶ the t-shirt was there. Grey, wrinkled from a long day‚Äôs work.

Then how? How did I see him wearing it?

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. I stayed sitting on the sofa, glancing towards the bathroom door every few minutes, expecting to see him standing there again. All the lights in the apartment were on, but the darkness was inside me.

The next morning, I woke up on the same sofa, my neck stiff and my body aching. The sun was rising, the street noise starting to pick up. I tried to convince myself again that what happened was a nightmare, a hallucination from fatigue. I went to work, tried to focus, kept myself busy with anything. But his image wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind. His bloated face, his empty eyes.

The following days became hell. I didn‚Äôt see him clearly anymore like that time in the bathroom, but I felt his presence more strongly. Things happened that had no explanation. I‚Äôd wake up in the morning to find wet footprints on the living room floor, even though it was summer and the apartment was completely dry. I‚Äôd smell a strange stench of decay, like stagnant water, that would appear and disappear suddenly. I‚Äôd hear a sound like someone choking or blowing air bubbles from water, coming from the direction of the bathroom at night.

I started being afraid to stay alone in the apartment. I began coming home from work as late as possible, sitting at the coffee shop with any colleague, anything to keep me out of the apartment for the longest time. And when I returned, I‚Äôd enter trembling, keep all the lights on, and turn on the TV or anything to make noise so I wouldn‚Äôt feel this terrifying silence.

Sleep became almost impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face. His pale, swollen face. I started living on coffee and stimulants, I looked like a zombie, my face yellow and dark circles under my eyes. People at work started noticing, asking me what was wrong, why I looked so tired. I‚Äôd dodge their questions with vague answers. What could I tell them? That I see a drowned version of myself in my apartment? They‚Äôd say I‚Äôd officially lost my mind.

One night, I was sitting in the living room, trying to read anything to help me sleep. I heard a scratching sound coming from the kitchen. I got up, my heart pounding fast, and grabbed the nearest thing to me ‚Äì it was a heavy ashtray. I entered the kitchen slowly‚Ä¶ the light was off, but the light from the living room illuminated the space a bit.

I found him.

He was standing at the sink, his back to me. Doing something with his hands in the sink, I couldn‚Äôt see exactly what. But I heard the sound of water, and another sound‚Ä¶ a sound like someone swallowing with difficulty.

I froze in place, the ashtray trembling in my hand. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Scream? Run? Hit him?

He slowly turned his face towards me. The same bloated face, the same vacant eyes. But this time‚Ä¶ there was like white foam around his mouth, like what appears on a drowned person. And his lips were slightly blue.

He opened his mouth‚Ä¶ no sound came out, but I felt an icy cold radiating from him, along with that disgusting smell of decay.

I don‚Äôt know what happened, but I found myself dropping the ashtray and running towards the apartment door, opening it, and flying down the stairs screaming like a madman. I ended up in the street barefoot, in my house clothes, people in the street staring at me with bewilderment and fear. I kept running until I reached a nearby coffee shop, collapsed onto a chair, panting and unable to breathe. The owner came asking what was wrong, people gathered around me. I couldn‚Äôt speak, tears just streamed down my face. Not tears of sadness, but tears of terror and despair.

After a while, I calmed down, drank a glass of water. I couldn‚Äôt go back to the apartment that night. I stayed at a friend‚Äôs place, after feeding him some lie about a burglar breaking in and me getting scared. Of course, he didn‚Äôt quite believe me, but he let me stay anyway.

The next day, I returned to the apartment in the morning, terrified. I opened the door slowly‚Ä¶ everything was as it was. No trace of him. I went into the kitchen‚Ä¶ the sink was dry, nothing strange. As if what happened last night was just another nightmare.

But I knew it wasn‚Äôt a nightmare. I saw him. I saw him clearly.

I started thinking. Why is he appearing to me? And why does he look like that? Why does he look like me? And why does he look drowned? I don‚Äôt even like water, I‚Äôm afraid of the sea, I‚Äôve never even thought of going to a beach resort alone. What does drowning have to do with me?

I started searching for any explanation. I read about ghosts, jinn, the 'Qareen' (spirit double). I tried reading Quran in the apartment, sprinkling salt in the corners like people say. Useless. The feeling of his presence was still there, and fear controlled me.

Another time, I was sleeping ‚Äì or trying to sleep ‚Äì in bed. I felt a weight on the edge of the bed, as if someone sat down next to me. I slowly opened my eyes‚Ä¶ I found him sitting there, looking at me. The same bloated face, the wet clothes dripping water onto the floor. I couldn‚Äôt move, felt my whole body was paralyzed. He just stared at me like that for a minute, then got up, walked towards the bathroom, and disappeared.

A few days later, something even stranger happened. I was brushing my teeth in the morning in front of the mirror. I looked at my reflection‚Ä¶ me, Ashraf, looking normal, tired and worn out like every day. I closed my eyes and opened them again‚Ä¶ I saw the face in the mirror changing. Swelling slowly, the skin becoming pale and stretched, the eyes emptying‚Ä¶ it became him. My reflection in the mirror became his reflection. I kept staring, disbelieving, I put my hand on my face‚Ä¶ my skin felt normal. But the image in the mirror‚Ä¶ the image of a drowned, dead man.

I screamed and backed away from the mirror quickly, bumping into the washing machine, stumbling backward, trembling. I looked again cautiously‚Ä¶ my reflection was back to normal.

It was here that I started connecting the dots. Why does he look like me? Why does he appear specifically to me? Why in my apartment? Why does he look drowned?

The idea started forming in my mind like a malignant tumor. An idea so terrifying that I tried to push it away every time it surfaced.

He isn't just an ordinary ghost. He isn't a jinn. He isn't my Qareen.

He‚Ä¶ is me.

But not me now. Me‚Ä¶ later.

Me‚Ä¶ dead.

The man I keep seeing‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs me after I die. Dead by drowning.

This realization hit me like a lightning bolt. Everything suddenly made sense. His constant appearances, his appearance, his presence in my private spaces (the bathroom, the bed, the kitchen), the t-shirt he was wearing‚Ä¶ it was all a message. A horrifying message about my future. About my end.

I am going to die by drowning.

But how? And where? And why? These questions had no answers. All I knew was the terrifying truth I had seen with my own eyes. I had seen my death. I had seen my corpse.

After this realization, the world turned darker in my eyes. It wasn't just fear of the ghost haunting me anymore. It became fear of inevitable fate. Fear of the destiny awaiting me. Every day I woke up, I felt I was getting closer to that moment. Every time I entered the bathroom, I felt the water coming from the shower would swallow me. Every time I looked in the mirror, I expected to see his bloated face staring back.

Life lost its taste. I stopped going to work, making excuses about being sick. I wasn‚Äôt eating well, I lost weight and became like a scarecrow. The people around me, even my friend whose place I stayed at, started distancing themselves; maybe they really thought I had gone crazy. And I couldn‚Äôt blame them. I myself felt like I was on the edge of madness.

I started wandering the apartment like a ghost. Going from room to room, looking out the window at the street and the people walking by, living their lives normally, unaware that someone up here had already seen his end.

Last night, he appeared again. I was sitting on the floor in the living room, hugging my knees to my chest, staring at a blank wall. I felt him behind me. I didn't turn around. I don't know why, but I didn't. Maybe I had finally given up. Maybe it didn't matter anymore.

I felt his cold, wet hand touch my shoulder. A shiver ran through my entire body, but I didn't panic like all the other times. There was a strange feeling of surrender.

I heard a sound, not understandable words, but a sound like water moving with difficulty, the sound of a drowning person trying to breathe. The sound was coming from right behind me, very close.

I remained sitting there, eyes closed. I wanted all of this to end. I couldn't bear this terror for another day. I couldn't live knowing I would become like that. Looking so grotesque.

When the sound stopped, and the feeling of his presence vanished, I opened my eyes. I stood up. I felt utterly exhausted, as if my soul had been drained from me. But at the same time, I felt a strange clarity. As if everything was now understood.

I saw my future. I saw my end. Drowned.

Well‚Ä¶ if this is the inevitable end‚Ä¶ why wait for it? Why keep living in this terror every day, waiting for the moment the catastrophe happens? Waiting to find myself underwater, trying to breathe and failing, until my face bloats and my eyes become empty?

If this is my destiny‚Ä¶ then I will fulfill it myself. At least, I get to choose when and how. End this torment with my own hands.

I walked with steady steps towards the bathroom. As if a force was pulling me. I opened the door. I looked at the old, small bathtub, barely big enough for one person to sit in.

I turned on the hot and cold water taps together. The sound of the water filling the tub was loud in the silence of the apartment. I stood watching the water level rise, the steam rising to fog the mirror above the sink. The mirror where I saw his face‚Ä¶ my face‚Ä¶ clearly for the first time.

When the tub was almost full, I turned off the taps. Silence returned, nothing but the sound of my own breathing, and my heart beating with a strange slowness, as if it too had surrendered.

I slowly took off my clothes, throwing them on the floor. I stood before the bathtub. The water was still releasing a light steam.

I looked at my reflection on the water‚Äôs surface. My face was pale, my eyes held a strange look, a mixture of fear, despair, and‚Ä¶ relief?

Maybe this is the only possible relief now.

I stepped into the tub. The water was warmer than necessary, but I didn't feel anything. I sat down slowly, the water engulfing my body up to my chest.

I lifted my head and looked at the moldy bathroom ceiling. I took a deep breath‚Ä¶ the last one.

And I lowered my head under the water.

At first, I instinctively tried to resist. My body tried to surface, tried to breathe. But my mind was made up. I held onto the edges of the tub with both hands, forcing myself down underwater. Water entered my nose, my mouth, my ears. A sharp burning in my chest. My eyes were open underwater, watching the air bubbles escape from me.

His face‚Ä¶ my bloated face‚Ä¶ formed before my eyes underwater. Was it smiling? No, no expression. Vacant. Just like I saw it the first time.

I started to feel dizzy, the world spinning. The sounds faded. The burning in my chest began to subside, replaced by a strange feeling of lethargy and coldness.

The last thing I felt‚Ä¶ was the water filling me from the inside.

And then‚Ä¶ darkness.

And silence.

I must be imagining things‚Ä¶ I have to be.

My name is Ashraf. I‚Äôm just like any young man in Egypt, a year or two past twenty-five, living alone in an old rent-controlled apartment in a sort of working-class neighborhood here in Cairo. I have a modest job, I go, I come back, one day like the one before it, nothing new. Loneliness can be suffocating sometimes, but you get used to it. Or maybe you just think you‚Äôve gotten used to it.

It started about a month ago‚Ä¶ or maybe a little longer, I don‚Äôt remember exactly. Very simple things at first, like what‚Ä¶ like feeling someone rushed past you, the corner of your eye catches a shadow that vanishes. Of course, the first thing that comes to mind: exhaustion, lack of sleep, the stress of work and this crappy life. I‚Äôd shake my head and tell myself, ""Man, get over it, you just need some good sleep.""

But it stopped being just fleeting shadows. I started to feel it more. Like what? Like you‚Äôre sitting watching TV, the volume low because of the neighbors, and suddenly you feel breath behind your neck. You whip around‚Ä¶ nothing. You turn off the TV and just listen‚Ä¶ complete silence, except for the hum of the old fridge in the kitchen and the sound of cars passing in the street. The next day, you find the wardrobe door slightly ajar, and you‚Äôre a million percent sure you closed it properly before sleeping. Little things that make you doubt yourself, make you wonder, maybe I'm the one forgetting? Maybe I'm just not focused?

I stayed like this for two or three weeks. Denying it, lying to myself, saying it‚Äôs just my imagination. Until the night I‚Äôll never forget.

I came back from work late, dead tired. I‚Äôd barely entered the apartment, tossed my keys on the table near the door, and was heading to the bathroom to take a shower to wake myself up. The bathroom in this apartment is a bit dark, its lightbulb is weak and flickers sometimes. I stood in front of the mirror to wash my face, the cold water hit my face and jolted me awake a bit. I lifted my head while drying my face with the towel‚Ä¶ and I saw him.

Standing behind me, near the bathroom door.

My heart dropped to my feet. The towel fell from my hand into the sink. I kept staring into the mirror, unable to turn around. He‚Ä¶ he looked like me. Roughly the same height, same short black hair, same facial features‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt me. His face was‚Ä¶ bloated. Swollen. Like someone who had drowned and been pulled from the water after two or three days. The skin was pale, stretched in a weird way, and his eyes‚Ä¶ his eyes were empty, staring at me in the mirror without any expression. He was wearing the same grey t-shirt I had worn that morning before leaving for work.

Seconds passed like hours. I was frozen in place, hearing my heartbeat pounding in my ears like a drum. The breath I‚Äôd felt behind my neck these past days‚Ä¶ it was him. The shadow I kept glimpsing‚Ä¶ it was him.

I gathered all my courage and spun around quickly.

No one.

The bathroom door was closed just as it was. The air in the bathroom felt suddenly cold; I felt a shiver run down my entire body. I looked back in the mirror again‚Ä¶ I was alone. My face in the mirror was yellow and drawn, my eyes wide with terror.

I left the bathroom, my legs stumbling over each other. I sat on the sofa in the living room, trying to process what I‚Äôd seen. Drowned? Looked like me? What nonsense is this? It must have been a dream; I was tired and exhausted and must have fallen asleep standing in front of the mirror. Yes, that‚Äôs the only logical explanation.

But the grey t-shirt? I took it off this morning and threw it in the laundry basket. I ran to the bedroom, opened the laundry basket‚Ä¶ the t-shirt was there. Grey, wrinkled from a long day‚Äôs work.

Then how? How did I see him wearing it?

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. I stayed sitting on the sofa, glancing towards the bathroom door every few minutes, expecting to see him standing there again. All the lights in the apartment were on, but the darkness was inside me.

The next morning, I woke up on the same sofa, my neck stiff and my body aching. The sun was rising, the street noise starting to pick up. I tried to convince myself again that what happened was a nightmare, a hallucination from fatigue. I went to work, tried to focus, kept myself busy with anything. But his image wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind. His bloated face, his empty eyes.

The following days became hell. I didn‚Äôt see him clearly anymore like that time in the bathroom, but I felt his presence more strongly. Things happened that had no explanation. I‚Äôd wake up in the morning to find wet footprints on the living room floor, even though it was summer and the apartment was completely dry. I‚Äôd smell a strange stench of decay, like stagnant water, that would appear and disappear suddenly. I‚Äôd hear a sound like someone choking or blowing air bubbles from water, coming from the direction of the bathroom at night.

I started being afraid to stay alone in the apartment. I began coming home from work as late as possible, sitting at the coffee shop with any colleague, anything to keep me out of the apartment for the longest time. And when I returned, I‚Äôd enter trembling, keep all the lights on, and turn on the TV or anything to make noise so I wouldn‚Äôt feel this terrifying silence.

Sleep became almost impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face. His pale, swollen face. I started living on coffee and stimulants, I looked like a zombie, my face yellow and dark circles under my eyes. People at work started noticing, asking me what was wrong, why I looked so tired. I‚Äôd dodge their questions with vague answers. What could I tell them? That I see a drowned version of myself in my apartment? They‚Äôd say I‚Äôd officially lost my mind.

One night, I was sitting in the living room, trying to read anything to help me sleep. I heard a scratching sound coming from the kitchen. I got up, my heart pounding fast, and grabbed the nearest thing to me ‚Äì it was a heavy ashtray. I entered the kitchen slowly‚Ä¶ the light was off, but the light from the living room illuminated the space a bit.

I found him.

He was standing at the sink, his back to me. Doing something with his hands in the sink, I couldn‚Äôt see exactly what. But I heard the sound of water, and another sound‚Ä¶ a sound like someone swallowing with difficulty.

I froze in place, the ashtray trembling in my hand. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Scream? Run? Hit him?

He slowly turned his face towards me. The same bloated face, the same vacant eyes. But this time‚Ä¶ there was like white foam around his mouth, like what appears on a drowned person. And his lips were slightly blue.

He opened his mouth‚Ä¶ no sound came out, but I felt an icy cold radiating from him, along with that disgusting smell of decay.

I don‚Äôt know what happened, but I found myself dropping the ashtray and running towards the apartment door, opening it, and flying down the stairs screaming like a madman. I ended up in the street barefoot, in my house clothes, people in the street staring at me with bewilderment and fear. I kept running until I reached a nearby coffee shop, collapsed onto a chair, panting and unable to breathe. The owner came asking what was wrong, people gathered around me. I couldn‚Äôt speak, tears just streamed down my face. Not tears of sadness, but tears of terror and despair.

After a while, I calmed down, drank a glass of water. I couldn‚Äôt go back to the apartment that night. I stayed at a friend‚Äôs place, after feeding him some lie about a burglar breaking in and me getting scared. Of course, he didn‚Äôt quite believe me, but he let me stay anyway.

I started searching for any explanation. I read about ghosts, jinn, the 'Qareen' (spirit double). I tried reading Quran in the apartment, sprinkling salt in the corners like people say. Useless. The feeling of his presence was still there, and fear controlled me.

Another time, I was sleeping ‚Äì or trying to sleep ‚Äì in bed. I felt a weight on the edge of the bed, as if someone sat down next to me. I slowly opened my eyes‚Ä¶ I found him sitting there, looking at me. The same bloated face, the wet clothes dripping water onto the floor. I couldn‚Äôt move, felt my whole body was paralyzed.

1kc7qw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kc7qw6/hospital_floor_c/,Hospital Floor C,"I have been working as a crematorium operator for 8 years, coming up in July. I stumbled into this profession accidentally when working at a hospital as a patient transporter. My job then was just to take patients from point A to point B.¬†



Being a patient transporter is not a bad gig. Most people come along just fine; however, some don‚Äôt. The elderly who have been burdened by memory loss usually take some convincing. But the worst are the mentally unstable patients. When these people pop up from time to time, they can throw the entire schedule off.¬†



I‚Äôm a pretty tall and well-built guy. No six pack, but I regularly go to the gym and try to eat right. I was often called in when there were rowdy patients who needed transporting, due to my physical appearance.¬†



I‚Äôve spent time trying to convince a man that the doctor was not trying to put eels in his brain so he could hear his thoughts, and having to physically restrain a woman from smashing a flower pot into the back of someone's head. I‚Äôve dealt with the sweetest people and people who do nothing except burden the modern world with their existence.



After two years of working this job, my boss approached me and asked if I would be interested in a special type of promotion. I, of course, told him that I was very interested.



We scheduled a meeting to discuss what the promotion would entail. Things like job duties, benefits, and most importantly, pay.



He started by telling me what my assignments would be. I‚Äôd be transporting the bodies of deceased patients down to the cremator, simple. At certain hospitals, this would have already been one of my expected assignments. However, at my work, only specialized personnel could move the deceased.¬†



The rest of the staff calls them the reapers. When a patient has passed away, they are quick to appear, take the body, and leave. That is pretty much the only time they are seen.¬†



He then told me basic stuff: cover them so you don‚Äôt traumatize a kid by showing them a dead person, take the body to an elevator down to the basement, yada, yada, yada.

What was very interesting was the pay. It was s*ky fucking high*. I would do anything for that type of pay. And oh, I did.



I accepted my new position. Better pay, I don‚Äôt have to argue with wackos, plus I only appear when I have to. That sounds fucking great.



When I returned to work the next morning, there was a dead body that had to be taken care of.



I got called in, and after the family had said their goodbyes, I began pushing the movable bed towards the elevator. The dead body that was once Thomas Neil weighed around 90 kg and was about 185 cm tall.¬†



This was relevant information as I had come to learn that a lot of cremators are very automated today. You simply put in, name, weight, height, and gender, and the machine does the rest.



I scanned my brand new tag and pushed the once-forbidden C button.



The elevator slowly made its way down, and the doors slid open. The rumors that the other hospital staff had made up about the reapers' C floor could not have been further from the truth.



There were no bunkbeds that they all slept in, nor were there any coffins for anyone to sleep in. It looked like a normal break room, people sipping coffee and chatting.



An old lady greeted me. With a friendly tone, she said, ‚ÄúOkay, follow me, I‚Äôll show you the ropes‚Äù.



It was weird seeing how nonchalant she was about the entire thing. I was transporting someone who was once living and breathing, full of life and dreams, but the lady didn‚Äôt seem to mind. She was busy talking about how the free coffee was quite shit, and that I should bring my own, or swearing that she forgot about her grandkids birthday.



We eventually reached a big double door.¬† She opened it and gestured for me to go inside. The room we walked into was gigantic. The room didn‚Äôt make sense. The ceiling was too high not to be visible from above ground. The ground was uneven and hard to walk on.



The uneven terrain made the body's arms fly all over the place, like it was having a seizure. I‚Äôm a bit ashamed to say that I still laugh about that to this day.



In the middle of the room, there was a pit. Holy shit, did the pit smell. It reminded me of that one time I forgot a few steaks in my car in the middle of summer. I looked down into it and saw no bottom. However, there were rhythmic waves of air coming out of it, hitting my face.



The old lady gave me strict orders on how I should align the bed next to the pit. I followed suit.



She then showed me a lever on the side of the inner bedframe. When I pulled the lever two bed legs shortened, and the body rolled off down into the pit.



I stared but didn‚Äôt question anything. I was being paid too well to ask questions about this.



I saw how the body disappeared out of sight down into the pit. As we turned to walk back out, I could hear the faint sound of something smacking its lips. It sounded greasy.



The old lady, whom I later learned was named Kathy, a woman whom I now adore. She swore like a sailor and drinks like one, too. She then showed me what was next on the agenda.



I was supposed to scoop up some wood ashes, put them into a temporary urn, and label it with the guy's name. The only question I asked was what if the family does not want to cremate the body? They had it covered. You just got a doll of the body made.¬†



Quite impressive, honestly, they got the same weight, height, and freckles. It was the same down to the last minute detail. I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt need to make them that detailed. Better safe than sorry, I guess.



I don‚Äôt hate my job. Honestly, I quite enjoy it. Easy money, the co-workers are fine, and I barely work. I still have to listen to those greasy lips smacking whenever I deliver a body, but a pair of earplugs quickly stopped that problem. The only annoying part of the job is waiting for the weepy family members to leave the body. Oh, and giving them those dust jars. Jesus Christ, you would think I handed them their death sentence.



I guess this is a type of confession. I don‚Äôt feel bad for what I do. The only time I do is when I have to move the young ones. I always make sure I have my earplugs in when I drop them off. But hey, the family still gets closure, and I get paid.¬†

I must be imagining things‚Ä¶ I have to be.

My name is Ashraf. I‚Äôm just like any young man in Egypt, a year or two past twenty-five, living alone in an old rent-controlled apartment in a sort of working-class neighborhood here in Cairo. I have a modest job, I go, I come back, one day like the one before it, nothing new. Loneliness can be suffocating sometimes, but you get used to it. Or maybe you just think you‚Äôve gotten used to it.

It started about a month ago‚Ä¶ or maybe a little longer, I don‚Äôt remember exactly. Very simple things at first, like what‚Ä¶ like feeling someone rushed past you, the corner of your eye catches a shadow that vanishes. Of course, the first thing that comes to mind: exhaustion, lack of sleep, the stress of work and this crappy life. I‚Äôd shake my head and tell myself, ""Man, get over it, you just need some good sleep.""

But it stopped being just fleeting shadows. I started to feel it more. Like what? Like you‚Äôre sitting watching TV, the volume low because of the neighbors, and suddenly you feel breath behind your neck. You whip around‚Ä¶ nothing. You turn off the TV and just listen‚Ä¶ complete silence, except for the hum of the old fridge in the kitchen and the sound of cars passing in the street. The next day, you find the wardrobe door slightly ajar, and you‚Äôre a million percent sure you closed it properly before sleeping. Little things that make you doubt yourself, make you wonder, maybe I'm the one forgetting? Maybe I'm just not focused?

I stayed like this for two or three weeks. Denying it, lying to myself, saying it‚Äôs just my imagination. Until the night I‚Äôll never forget.

I came back from work late, dead tired. I‚Äôd barely entered the apartment, tossed my keys on the table near the door, and was heading to the bathroom to take a shower to wake myself up. The bathroom in this apartment is a bit dark, its lightbulb is weak and flickers sometimes. I stood in front of the mirror to wash my face, the cold water hit my face and jolted me awake a bit. I lifted my head while drying my face with the towel‚Ä¶ and I saw him.

Standing behind me, near the bathroom door.

My heart dropped to my feet. The towel fell from my hand into the sink. I kept staring into the mirror, unable to turn around. He‚Ä¶ he looked like me. Roughly the same height, same short black hair, same facial features‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt me. His face was‚Ä¶ bloated. Swollen. Like someone who had drowned and been pulled from the water after two or three days. The skin was pale, stretched in a weird way, and his eyes‚Ä¶ his eyes were empty, staring at me in the mirror without any expression. He was wearing the same grey t-shirt I had worn that morning before leaving for work.

Seconds passed like hours. I was frozen in place, hearing my heartbeat pounding in my ears like a drum. The breath I‚Äôd felt behind my neck these past days‚Ä¶ it was him. The shadow I kept glimpsing‚Ä¶ it was him.

I gathered all my courage and spun around quickly.

No one.

The bathroom door was closed just as it was. The air in the bathroom felt suddenly cold; I felt a shiver run down my entire body. I looked back in the mirror again‚Ä¶ I was alone. My face in the mirror was yellow and drawn, my eyes wide with terror.

I left the bathroom, my legs stumbling over each other. I sat on the sofa in the living room, trying to process what I‚Äôd seen. Drowned? Looked like me? What nonsense is this? It must have been a dream; I was tired and exhausted and must have fallen asleep standing in front of the mirror. Yes, that‚Äôs the only logical explanation.

But the grey t-shirt? I took it off this morning and threw it in the laundry basket. I ran to the bedroom, opened the laundry basket‚Ä¶ the t-shirt was there. Grey, wrinkled from a long day‚Äôs work.

Then how? How did I see him wearing it?

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. I stayed sitting on the sofa, glancing towards the bathroom door every few minutes, expecting to see him standing there again. All the lights in the apartment were on, but the darkness was inside me.

The next morning, I woke up on the same sofa, my neck stiff and my body aching. The sun was rising, the street noise starting to pick up. I tried to convince myself again that what happened was a nightmare, a hallucination from fatigue. I went to work, tried to focus, kept myself busy with anything. But his image wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind. His bloated face, his empty eyes.

The following days became hell. I didn‚Äôt see him clearly anymore like that time in the bathroom, but I felt his presence more strongly. Things happened that had no explanation. I‚Äôd wake up in the morning to find wet footprints on the living room floor, even though it was summer and the apartment was completely dry. I‚Äôd smell a strange stench of decay, like stagnant water, that would appear and disappear suddenly. I‚Äôd hear a sound like someone choking or blowing air bubbles from water, coming from the direction of the bathroom at night.

I started being afraid to stay alone in the apartment. I began coming home from work as late as possible, sitting at the coffee shop with any colleague, anything to keep me out of the apartment for the longest time. And when I returned, I‚Äôd enter trembling, keep all the lights on, and turn on the TV or anything to make noise so I wouldn‚Äôt feel this terrifying silence.

Sleep became almost impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face. His pale, swollen face. I started living on coffee and stimulants, I looked like a zombie, my face yellow and dark circles under my eyes. People at work started noticing, asking me what was wrong, why I looked so tired. I‚Äôd dodge their questions with vague answers. What could I tell them? That I see a drowned version of myself in my apartment? They‚Äôd say I‚Äôd officially lost my mind.

One night, I was sitting in the living room, trying to read anything to help me sleep. I heard a scratching sound coming from the kitchen. I got up, my heart pounding fast, and grabbed the nearest thing to me ‚Äì it was a heavy ashtray. I entered the kitchen slowly‚Ä¶ the light was off, but the light from the living room illuminated the space a bit.

I found him.

He was standing at the sink, his back to me. Doing something with his hands in the sink, I couldn‚Äôt see exactly what. But I heard the sound of water, and another sound‚Ä¶ a sound like someone swallowing with difficulty.

I froze in place, the ashtray trembling in my hand. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Scream? Run? Hit him?

He slowly turned his face towards me. The same bloated face, the same vacant eyes. But this time‚Ä¶ there was like white foam around his mouth, like what appears on a drowned person. And his lips were slightly blue.

He opened his mouth‚Ä¶ no sound came out, but I felt an icy cold radiating from him, along with that disgusting smell of decay.

I don‚Äôt know what happened, but I found myself dropping the ashtray and running towards the apartment door, opening it, and flying down the stairs screaming like a madman. I ended up in the street barefoot, in my house clothes, people in the street staring at me with bewilderment and fear. I kept running until I reached a nearby coffee shop, collapsed onto a chair, panting and unable to breathe. The owner came asking what was wrong, people gathered around me. I couldn‚Äôt speak, tears just streamed down my face. Not tears of sadness, but tears of terror and despair.

After a while, I calmed down, drank a glass of water. I couldn‚Äôt go back to the apartment that night. I stayed at a friend‚Äôs place, after feeding him some lie about a burglar breaking in and me getting scared. Of course, he didn‚Äôt quite believe me, but he let me stay anyway.

The next day, I returned to the apartment in the morning, terrified. I opened the door slowly‚Ä¶ everything was as it was. No trace of him. I went into the kitchen‚Ä¶ the sink was dry, nothing strange. As if what happened last night was just another nightmare.

But I knew it wasn‚Äôt a nightmare. I saw him. I saw him clearly.

I started thinking. Why is he appearing to me? And why does he look like that? Why does he look like me? And why does he look drowned? I don‚Äôt even like water, I‚Äôm afraid of the sea, I‚Äôve never even thought of going to a beach resort alone. What does drowning have to do with me?

I started searching for any explanation. I read about ghosts, jinn, the 'Qareen' (spirit double). I tried reading Quran in the apartment, sprinkling salt in the corners like people say. Useless. The feeling of his presence was still there, and fear controlled me.

Another time, I was sleeping ‚Äì or trying to sleep ‚Äì in bed. I felt a weight on the edge of the bed, as if someone sat down next to me. I slowly opened my eyes‚Ä¶ I found him sitting there, looking at me. The same bloated face, the wet clothes dripping water onto the floor. I couldn‚Äôt move, felt my whole body was paralyzed. He just stared at me like that for a minute, then got up, walked towards the bathroom, and disappeared.

A few days later, something even stranger happened. I was brushing my teeth in the morning in front of the mirror. I looked at my reflection‚Ä¶ me, Ashraf, looking normal, tired and worn out like every day. I closed my eyes and opened them again‚Ä¶ I saw the face in the mirror changing. Swelling slowly, the skin becoming pale and stretched, the eyes emptying‚Ä¶ it became him. My reflection in the mirror became his reflection. I kept staring, disbelieving, I put my hand on my face‚Ä¶ my skin felt normal. But the image in the mirror‚Ä¶ the image of a drowned, dead man.

I screamed and backed away from the mirror quickly, bumping into the washing machine, stumbling backward, trembling. I looked again cautiously‚Ä¶ my reflection was back to normal.

It was here that I started connecting the dots. Why does he look like me? Why does he appear specifically to me? Why in my apartment? Why does he look drowned?

The idea started forming in my mind like a malignant tumor. An idea so terrifying that I tried to push it away every time it surfaced.

He isn't just an ordinary ghost. He isn't a jinn. He isn't my Qareen.

He‚Ä¶ is me.

But not me now. Me‚Ä¶ later.

Me‚Ä¶ dead.

The man I keep seeing‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs me after I die. Dead by drowning.

This realization hit me like a lightning bolt. Everything suddenly made sense. His constant appearances, his appearance, his presence in my private spaces (the bathroom, the bed, the kitchen), the t-shirt he was wearing‚Ä¶ it was all a message. A horrifying message about my future. About my end.

I am going to die by drowning.

But how? And where? And why? These questions had no answers. All I knew was the terrifying truth I had seen with my own eyes. I had seen my death. I had seen my corpse.

After this realization, the world turned darker in my eyes. It wasn't just fear of the ghost haunting me anymore. It became fear of inevitable fate. Fear of the destiny awaiting me. Every day I woke up, I felt I was getting closer to that moment. Every time I entered the bathroom, I felt the water coming from the shower would swallow me. Every time I looked in the mirror, I expected to see his bloated face staring back.

Life lost its taste. I stopped going to work, making excuses about being sick. I wasn‚Äôt eating well, I lost weight and became like a scarecrow. The people around me, even my friend whose place I stayed at, started distancing themselves; maybe they really thought I had gone crazy. And I couldn‚Äôt blame them. I myself felt like I was on the edge of madness.

I started wandering the apartment like a ghost. Going from room to room, looking out the window at the street and the people walking by, living their lives normally, unaware that someone up here had already seen his end.

Last night, he appeared again. I was sitting on the floor in the living room, hugging my knees to my chest, staring at a blank wall. I felt him behind me. I didn't turn around. I don't know why, but I didn't. Maybe I had finally given up. Maybe it didn't matter anymore.

I felt his cold, wet hand touch my shoulder. A shiver ran through my entire body, but I didn't panic like all the other times. There was a strange feeling of surrender.

I heard a sound, not understandable words, but a sound like water moving with difficulty, the sound of a drowning person trying to breathe. The sound was coming from right behind me, very close.

I remained sitting there, eyes closed. I wanted all of this to end. I couldn't bear this terror for another day. I couldn't live knowing I would become like that. Looking so grotesque.

When the sound stopped, and the feeling of his presence vanished, I opened my eyes. I stood up. I felt utterly exhausted, as if my soul had been drained from me. But at the same time, I felt a strange clarity. As if everything was now understood.

I saw my future. I saw my end. Drowned.

Well‚Ä¶ if this is the inevitable end‚Ä¶ why wait for it? Why keep living in this terror every day, waiting for the moment the catastrophe happens? Waiting to find myself underwater, trying to breathe and failing, until my face bloats and my eyes become empty?

If this is my destiny‚Ä¶ then I will fulfill it myself. At least, I get to choose when and how. End this torment with my own hands.

I walked with steady steps towards the bathroom. As if a force was pulling me. I opened the door. I looked at the old, small bathtub, barely big enough for one person to sit in.

I turned on the hot and cold water taps together. The sound of the water filling the tub was loud in the silence of the apartment. I stood watching the water level rise, the steam rising to fog the mirror above the sink. The mirror where I saw his face‚Ä¶ my face‚Ä¶ clearly for the first time.

When the tub was almost full, I turned off the taps. Silence returned, nothing but the sound of my own breathing, and my heart beating with a strange slowness, as if it too had surrendered.

I slowly took off my clothes, throwing them on the floor. I stood before the bathtub. The water was still releasing a light steam.

I looked at my reflection on the water‚Äôs surface. My face was pale, my eyes held a strange look, a mixture of fear, despair, and‚Ä¶ relief?

Maybe this is the only possible relief now.

I stepped into the tub. The water was warmer than necessary, but I didn't feel anything. I sat down slowly, the water engulfing my body up to my chest.

I lifted my head and looked at the moldy bathroom ceiling. I took a deep breath‚Ä¶ the last one.

And I lowered my head under the water.

At first, I instinctively tried to resist. My body tried to surface, tried to breathe. But my mind was made up. I held onto the edges of the tub with both hands, forcing myself down underwater. Water entered my nose, my mouth, my ears. A sharp burning in my chest. My eyes were open underwater, watching the air bubbles escape from me.

His face‚Ä¶ my bloated face‚Ä¶ formed before my eyes underwater. Was it smiling? No, no expression. Vacant. Just like I saw it the first time.

I started to feel dizzy, the world spinning. The sounds faded. The burning in my chest began to subside, replaced by a strange feeling of lethargy and coldness.

The last thing I felt‚Ä¶ was the water filling me from the inside.

And then‚Ä¶ darkness.

And silence.

Finally‚Ä¶ silence.",3,1746103272.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1st Grind Attempt: Hardly got half a portafilter of coffee  
2nd Grind attempt: upped the grind time until i got a decently full basket. The machine would not even drip so i cancelled that.  
3rd Grind Attempt: did some online reading and settled on Grind size of 12 and time of 15. got a few drips this time.  
4th Grind Attempt: I increased my grind size to 15, and the time left was at 15. There is a good amount of coffee in the portafilter. got about 20 grams of yield. did not taste that great  
5th Grind attempt (this morning) Upped the Grind size to 16 and left time at 15. About 15 grams yielded.  still not tasting great.

I read the specs and see that both machines can produce 9 bar. So why would his setup produce a delicious cup using his settings, and mine won't even drip?

------------

It feels very bad. You followed the plan. You ate less food for three whole weeks. You thought the number on the scale would go down. But it did not change. Maybe it even went up a little? This is confusing. It makes you feel like giving up. Many people feel this same way. It happens quite often, this **no weight loss** feeling even with effort. Do not worry too much right now. There are reasons this can happen. It does not always mean you are doing something wrong. We will look at why the scale might not move even when you are in a **calorie deficit**. You will learn about common issues and what you can try next.

I. Understanding the Calorie Deficit Basics
-------------------------------------------

Weight loss has a simple idea behind it. It is about energy balance. Food gives your body energy. We measure this energy in calories. Your body uses this energy all day. It uses energy even when you sleep. When you eat fewer calories than your body uses, this is a **calorie deficit**. This is the main way to lose body fat.

### A. What is a Calorie Deficit?

A calorie deficit means you take in less energy than you burn. Think like this: your body needs a certain amount of energy just to live. Breathing, thinking, heart beating ‚Äì all use calories. Moving around uses more calories. If you eat 1800 calories but your body uses 2100 calories, you have a 300 calorie deficit. The body needs to find that extra 300 calories somewhere. It often takes it from stored fat.

### B. The 3500 Calorie Idea

People often say you need a 3500 calorie deficit to lose one pound of fat. This means if you have a 500 calorie deficit each day for 7 days, you might lose one pound that week (500 x 7 = 3500). This number is a helpful guide. It gives you an idea of how things work.

### C. Just an Estimate

Remember, that 3500 number is only an estimate. It is not a perfect rule for every single person. Your body is unique. How fast your body burns energy (your metabolism) is different from others. How much you move each day changes things. Your hormones, your sleep, your stress ‚Äì many things affect weight loss. So, a 3500 calorie deficit might not equal exactly one pound of fat loss for *you* every single time. It is a starting point, not a guarantee. Sometimes the body holds onto water, which hides fat loss on the scale.

II. Potential Reasons for No Weight Loss in 3 Weeks (Addressing Search Intent Early)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, three weeks passed. You believe you are in a deficit. Still, **no weight loss** shows on the scale. This is the main problem we need to solve. Let us look at the most common reasons right away.

### A. Water Retention

Your body weight is not just fat. It is muscle, bone, organs, and a lot of water. Sometimes, your body holds onto extra water. This makes the scale number stay the same, or even go up, even if you lost some fat. This is **water retention** or **water weight**.

1. **Salty Food:** Eating more salt (sodium) than usual can make your body hold water. Even one salty meal can make the scale jump up for a day or two. If your salt intake goes up and down, your water weight will too. Check packaged foods, restaurant meals ‚Äì salt hides in many places.
2. **Stress:** When you feel stressed, your body makes a hormone called cortisol. High cortisol can make your body hold onto water. Starting a new diet or exercise plan can be stressful itself. Worrying about the scale number can also add stress.
3. **Creatine:** If you started taking creatine supplements to help with exercise, know this: creatine pulls water into your muscles. This is good for muscle function, but it will increase your water weight on the scale. It's not fat gain.

### B. Inaccurate Calorie Tracking

This is a very common reason for a **weight loss plateau**. You think you are eating one amount, but you are actually eating more. Or, you think you are burning lots of calories with exercise, but you are burning less.

1. **Underestimating Intake:** Studies show most people guess their calorie intake incorrectly. Often, they think they eat less than they really do. Sometimes by 20% or even more! Small things add up: the oil used for cooking, a handful of nuts, a taste while cooking, the milk in your coffee. These **hidden calories** make a difference.
2. **Overestimating Burning:** Fitness trackers and exercise machines give estimates of calories burned. These numbers are not always right. They can often be too high. You might think you burned 500 calories, but it was only 350. This means your deficit is smaller than you thought.
3. **Need for Precision:** The best way to know your intake is to be precise. Use a food scale to weigh your food, especially calorie-dense items like grains, nuts, oils, and meats. Use measuring cups and spoons for liquids and powders. Tracking apps help, but only if the information you put in is accurate. Precise **calorie tracking** is key for a while.

### C. Metabolic Adaptation/Plateau

Your body is smart. It wants to survive. When you consistently eat fewer calories, your body might adapt. It tries to become more efficient with less energy. This is sometimes called metabolic adaptation or a **slow metabolism** response.

1. **Body Adaptation:** Over weeks or months of being in a deficit, your body might slightly lower the number of calories it burns at rest. This is partly because you weigh less (a smaller body needs less energy) and partly hormonal changes. Your body tries to close the gap between calories in and calories out. This can slow down weight loss, leading to a **weight loss plateau**. Some research shows this adaptation happens.
2. **Fighting Adaptation:** You can try things to counter this. A **diet break**, where you eat at your maintenance calorie level (not a deficit, not a surplus) for a week or two, can sometimes help reset hormones and metabolism. Short 'refeeds' (a day or two of higher calories, usually from carbs) might also help. Changing your exercise routine can also give your metabolism a nudge.

III. The Role of Macro Nutrients
--------------------------------

Calories matter most for weight loss. But *where* those calories come from also plays a part. The main types of food energy are protein, carbohydrates (carbs), and fats. These are macronutrients. How you balance them can affect your hunger, energy, muscle, and how your body uses fuel, even within your **calorie deficit**.

### A. Protein's Role in Satiety and Muscle Preservation

Protein is very important during weight loss.

1. **Feeling Full:** Protein helps you feel fuller for longer compared to carbs or fats. Eating enough protein at meals can reduce hunger later. This makes it easier to stick to your calorie goal without feeling hungry all the time. It helps control appetite.
2. **Keeping Muscle:** When you lose weight, you can lose both fat and muscle. Losing muscle is not good. Muscle burns more calories at rest than fat does. Eating enough protein helps protect your muscle mass while you are in a deficit. More muscle means your body burns slightly more calories all day long. Aiming for adequate protein supports **muscle gain** or preservation.

### B. Carbohydrate Intake and its Influence on Energy Levels and Insulin

Carbohydrates are the body's main, preferred source of energy.

1. **Carb Types Matter:** Not all carbs are the same. Simple carbs (like sugar, white bread) give quick energy but can lead to crashes and hunger. Complex carbs (like whole grains, vegetables, beans) release energy more slowly. They provide fiber, which also helps with fullness. Choosing mostly complex carbs is usually better for steady energy and appetite control.
2. **Insulin Connection:** Carbs cause your body to release insulin. Insulin helps move sugar from your blood into your cells for energy or storage. Eating very large amounts of simple carbs frequently can lead to higher insulin levels. Insulin also plays a role in signaling the body to store fat. Managing carb intake, especially refined carbs, can be helpful for some people.

### C. Fat's Role in Hormone Regulation and Overall Health

Fat is also essential. You need it, even when losing weight.

1. **Hormone Health:** Dietary fats are crucial for making important hormones, including those involved in metabolism and reproduction. Very low-fat diets can sometimes disrupt hormone balance. Including healthy fats (like those in avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil) is important.
2. **Satiety and Health:** Fat also helps you feel satisfied after eating. It adds flavor to food. Healthy fats are important for absorbing certain vitamins and for overall cell function. Choose healthy unsaturated fats over saturated and trans fats most of the time.

IV. The Importance of Exercise and Activity Levels
--------------------------------------------------

Diet is key for creating a **calorie deficit**. But exercise and general activity are also very important parts of the weight management picture. Movement burns calories and offers many health benefits beyond just weight loss.

### A. The Benefits of Resistance Training

Lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises (resistance training) is helpful.

1. **Boosting Metabolism:** Resistance training builds muscle. As we said, muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue. Building even a little muscle can slightly increase your basal metabolic rate (how many calories you burn just existing). This helps you burn more calories 24/7. It assists with avoiding a **slow metabolism**.
2. **Improving Insulin Sensitivity:** This type of exercise can make your body's cells more responsive to insulin. This means your body can manage blood sugar better, which can be helpful for fat loss and overall health.

### B. The Role of Cardiovascular Exercise

Cardio exercise gets your heart rate up. Things like walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling are examples.

1. **Burning Calories:** Cardio directly burns calories while you are doing it. The longer or harder you go, the more calories you burn. This helps increase your overall calorie deficit.
2. **Heart Health:** Cardio is excellent for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. These benefits are important regardless of weight loss.

### C. NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)

This is a fancy term for all the calories you burn *outside* of planned exercise. It is the energy used for daily life activities.

1. **What is NEAT?:** **NEAT** includes walking to your car, typing, fidgeting, cleaning the house, taking the stairs, gardening, playing with kids. It might seem small, but it adds up significantly over the day. For some people, **NEAT** burns more calories than their actual workouts!
2. **Increasing NEAT:** You can consciously increase your **NEAT**. Park further away. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Stand up and walk around during phone calls. Pace while thinking. Get up from your desk every hour. Small movements accumulate and boost your daily calorie burn without requiring gym time.

V. Hidden Calories and Mindful Eating
-------------------------------------

Sometimes, the reason for **no weight loss** is sneaky calories you do not realize you are consuming. Also, *how* you eat matters. Paying attention can make a big difference.

### A. Liquid Calories

Calories you drink are easy to overlook. They often do not make you feel as full as solid food calories.

1. **Sugary Drinks:** Sodas, fruit juices (even 100% juice), sweetened teas, energy drinks can contain a lot of sugar and calories. Drinking these regularly can easily prevent weight loss or cause weight gain. Alcohol also contains calories, and it can lower inhibitions, leading to eating more food.
2. **Coffee Add-ins:** Black coffee has almost no calories. But adding sugar, syrups, cream, whipped cream, or even large amounts of milk adds calories quickly. A fancy coffee drink can sometimes have as many calories as a small meal.

### B. Sauces, Dressings, and Condiments

These add flavor, but they can also add significant calories and fat.

1. **Often High-Calorie:** Creamy salad dressings, mayonnaise, some barbecue sauces, cheese sauces, and even ketchup (due to sugar) can pack a caloric punch. Just a tablespoon or two can add 100 calories or more without you noticing. People often forget to account for these in their **calorie tracking**.
2. **Lower-Calorie Choices:** Opt for vinegar-based dressings, mustard, hot sauce, herbs, spices, salsa, or light versions of your favorite sauces. Measure your portions instead of pouring freely.

### C. Mindful Eating Techniques

Mindful eating means paying full attention to your food and the experience of eating. It can help you recognize your body's signals better.

1. **Hunger/Fullness Cues:** Eat when you are truly hungry, not just bored or stressed. Stop eating when you feel comfortably full, not stuffed. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to register fullness, so eating slowly helps.
2. **Avoid Distractions:** Turn off the TV, put away your phone, and sit at a table to eat. When you are distracted, you are more likely to overeat because you are not paying attention to your body's signals or how much you have consumed. Focus on the taste, texture, and smell of your food.

VI. Troubleshooting and What To Do Next
---------------------------------------

So, you have considered all these points. You still face **no weight loss** after 3 weeks in a perceived **calorie deficit**. What steps can you take now? It is time to troubleshoot systematically.

### A. Re-evaluate Calorie Intake and Expenditure

The first step is always to double-check your numbers with honesty and precision.

1. **Track Meticulously:** Commit to tracking *everything* you eat and drink for one full week. Use a food scale for solids and measuring cups/spoons for liquids. Be brutally honest. Include every bite, lick, taste, sauce, oil, and drink. Record it immediately. This period of strict **calorie tracking** can reveal inaccuracies.
2. **Reassess Needs:** Your calorie needs might have changed, especially if you have lost some weight already or your activity level changed. Use a reliable online TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculator. Input your current weight, height, age, sex, and realistic activity level. See if the calorie target you have been using is still appropriate. Maybe your deficit needs to be slightly larger, or perhaps it was too aggressive initially.

### B. Adjust Macronutrient Ratios

If your calorie tracking is accurate and you are definitely in a deficit, you could experiment slightly with your macros.

1. **Protein/Fat Adjustment:** Sometimes, slightly increasing protein can help with satiety and muscle preservation, making the deficit feel easier. Increasing healthy fats slightly while reducing carbs might help some people with energy levels and hormone balance. Make small changes, not drastic ones.
2. **Carbohydrate Adjustment:** If you eat a lot of refined carbs, try swapping some for complex carbs or slightly reducing the overall amount. Some people find they feel better or break a plateau by managing carb intake more carefully, but do not eliminate them entirely unless advised by a professional.

### C. Implement Diet Breaks or Refeeds

If you suspect metabolic adaptation might be slowing things down, a temporary change could help.

1. **Diet Break:** Consider taking a planned **diet break**. For 1-2 weeks, increase your calories back up to your estimated maintenance level. Focus on whole foods. This isn't a 'cheat' period but a structured break from the deficit. It can potentially help normalize hormones like leptin and thyroid hormone and reduce psychological diet fatigue. Then, you can return to your deficit.
2. **Refeed Days:** Alternatively, incorporate planned 'refeed' days once or twice a week. On these days, you eat at maintenance or slightly above, primarily increasing carbohydrate intake. This is shorter than a full diet break but might offer similar, smaller benefits against adaptation.

### D. Seek Professional Guidance

If you have tried these steps consistently and are still stuck, or if you have underlying health conditions, it might be time to consult professionals. A registered dietitian can help create a personalized eating plan and ensure you are meeting your nutrient needs. A certified personal trainer can help design an effective and safe exercise program. A doctor can rule out any underlying medical issues (like thyroid problems or hormonal imbalances) that might affect weight loss.

Conclusion
----------

Feeling stuck after three weeks of trying to lose weight in a **calorie deficit** is a common hurdle. It does not automatically mean failure. As we saw, reasons can range from simple **water retention** hiding fat loss, to errors in **calorie tracking**, or the body adapting through a **slow metabolism** effect. The types of food you eat, your exercise habits including **NEAT**, and even **hidden calories** all play roles.

The key is not to give up, but to troubleshoot patiently. Double-check your intake with honesty. Ensure you get enough protein. Stay active with both planned exercise and daily movement. Be mindful of sneaky calories. Consider strategies like a **diet break** if needed. Remember, the scale is just one measure of progress. How do your clothes fit? How are your energy levels? Are you getting stronger? Focus on building sustainable healthy habits for overall well-being. Weight loss is often not linear; patience and consistency are your best tools.

1kc7m7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kc7m7t/explore_the_sportdog_sd825x_review_is_it_the_best/,Explore the SportDOG SD-825X review: Is it the best dog training collar?,"Testing the **SportDOG SD-825X SportHunter 825X Training Collar**, I've worn many hats‚Äîtrainer, pet parent, occasional dog whisperer‚Äîand this device has genuinely reshaped my dogs' learning curve. The brand pitches it as a reliable, humanely-designed tool for effectively managing canine behavior in any scenario, and for the most part, it delivers. But this collar isn't flawless, and I noticed quirks worth sharing alongside its standout strengths.

**Design and Durability**  
The first thing I noticed upon unboxing is how light yet sturdy the design is. At just 3.04 ounces, the collar is so lightweight that my 45-pound Labrador, Max, barely noticed it. Yet its nylon material and DryTek waterproofing scream ‚Äúhardy!‚Äù The collar endured Max‚Äôs muddy dives into the creek and even survived my doodle, Bella's sneaky counter attempts in wet grass. The remote‚Äîwith firm yet tactile buttons‚Äîis intuitively built. I particularly liked the removable antenna keeping it streamlined without looking like I‚Äôm operating a drone. Just wipe it dry per care instructions, and it's good to go.

**Customizable Stimulation Options**  
I used several features during testing, and one of my favorites is its flexibility for various training scenarios. With 21 levels of stimulation, including vibration (buzz) and tone (beep), I could adjust for every mood or distraction my dogs exhibited. My cousin‚Äôs beagle Milo, a somewhat hyper runner, instantly recognized the vibration‚Äôs cue and responded much better than expected. Having the option to tailor sensitivity based on the situation or dog's temperament felt like an ace.

Check [SportDOG SD-825X] price on Amazon.  

**Distance Range for All-Day Explorers**  
The half-a-mile range is a lifesaver for dog owners who frequent open spaces. During our family hikes through dog-friendly trails, Max's habit of chasing butterflies left me on edge. With this range, instructions transmitted seamlessly, reassuring me of uninterrupted training even from afar. In an empty field, I also tested its limits‚Äîresults were generally consistent unless large metal structures blocked the way (hello, urban adventures!).

**Battery Efficiency and Rechargeability**  
Honestly, the battery life deserves applause. A full charge only takes about two hours, lasting some solid 50 to 70 hours depending on usage. Not having to worry about the collar dying mid-session is brilliant. Though I‚Äôll admit, forgetting to charge the remote was a human flaw on my part; a dedicated charging reminder feature might help forgetful-pet-parents like me.

**User Compatibility and Multi-Dog Usability**  
One huge edge is you can train up to three dogs simultaneously using the remote (you‚Äôll need additional collars), making it ideal for multispecies madness like mine. The no-look operation is another thoughtful touch‚Äîparticularly helpful when juggling coffee with one hand and leash-taming Bella with the other. Adjusting levels blindfolded, mid-session, took effort but felt satisfying knowing fewer misses occur when you‚Äôre hands-on.

**Ease of Maintenance**  
This training collar earns practicality points through easy instructions for care. After Max finished tumbling over saltwater shores last summer, cleaning was a breeze‚Äîjust rinse and air-dry as stated in the care guide. It slipped back into storage cleanly while staying almost pristine despite routine grime action.

**Key Benefits**  
- Impressive half-a-mile range for remote commands.  
- Multiple stimulation modes (static, beep, buzz) tailored per dog‚Äôs sensibilities.  
- Strong waterproof performance; survived both dogs' creek escapades.  

**Flaws**  
- Adjusting without visually referencing the remote takes finesse, even after a little practice.  
- Multi-dog training capabilities shine but require purchasing additional collars‚Äîan added cost!  
- The static option may feel too mild for dogs with tougher skin or undercoat insulation.  

**Competing Products**  
As I put this training collar through its paces, direct competitors like **Garmin Delta XC** and **PetSafe Remote Trainer** came to mind. Compared to Garmin, SportDOG‚Äôs design feels a touch lighter, and the submersion depth is better. However, Garmin wins points for offering enhanced color-coded displays. PetSafe, meanwhile, is an excellent alternative for beginners but lacks the customizable stimulation I appreciated in the SportDOG product. Since I needed weatherproof durability in my toolbelt, this device pulled ahead easily.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Comparing overall cost, it stands out thanks to a combination of reasonable pricing and long-term viability. The rechargeable battery coupled with durable materials makes it feel like a smart investment. Some single-dog trainers might hesitate with initial expenses, finding cheaper alternatives tempting; however, the advanced usability wins here. Before splurging, weigh whether its features fit your pet's (or multiple pets‚Äô) needs.

I‚Äôve had the same therapist for about 3 years. I‚Äôve gone to the clinic for about 20 years seeing various people, but I have never met her in person because we started on zoom during pandemic stuff.

This therapist has done the following during our sessions:

- Eating (multiple occasions)
- Taking a phone call and not even muting so I could hear what the call was about and it was triggering
- Having her child help her with zoom technical difficulties 
- Closing her eyes during sessions when camera is on and using aromatherapy or a humidifier?
- Took her computer to the kitchen to make coffee while talking 

I give her grace, but I am starting to feel like she‚Äôs not really ‚Äúin it‚Äù or helping me. She speaks to me more like a colleague or peer.

Is this normal behavior?

I had a friend who I enjoyed talking with for months. Then one day they send me their nudes and tell me how much they wanna fuck me. KNOWING IM MONOGAMOUS. Then later on literally discuss how they‚Äôre open to DUMPING THEIR PARTNER to ‚Äúbe monogamous‚Äù with me‚Ä¶

Happened again with my second friend. All was going well for a couple months. We were talking really well and planning a day to meet. They told me they would bring their partner. I asked why since it was just supposed to be us meeting up and just getting coffee and talking for the first time. Out of nowhere they drop that they‚Äôre interested in me and wanna see if I‚Äôd join their polycule.. again! Knowing I‚Äôm MONOGAMOUS. 

After that second time I started becoming very weary to make friends with poly folks cause I‚Äôm never ‚Äújust a friend‚Äù to them. 
Then came recently, met a guy on a dating app. NOWHERE did he state at ALL he was poly and my profile STRICTLY says I‚Äôm monogamous. We were talking and having a good time. He‚Äôs flirting and being cute. Then drops that he‚Äôs poly and has a gf. Fuck off.
I said, ‚ÄúOh okay. Well, I‚Äôm not poly and since you are I‚Äôd like to just remain friends and hangout‚Äù. He says ‚Äúcool‚Äù. We keep talking and then meet up to go see a movie. He tries to fucking kiss me. I reject him. He asks why. I fucking repeat myself. And he gets upset about it. 

This week I went on an app where I‚Äôm chilling then read a post talking about ‚Äúwhy are fwb not actually friends?? I want a friend!! But we have sex!!‚Äù I ask them about that. They disclose how they literally see all their friends sexually at some point‚Ä¶ and would just like to fuck them once in a while. Wtf. 

At this point, I genuinely don‚Äôt think I can withstand poly people. Happy for y‚Äôall and good for y‚Äôall. But I can‚Äôt do this anymore. Can‚Äôt be friends. Can‚Äôt even make it clear I‚Äôm mono without someone trying to hide themselves being poly to try and fuck me.

I slept with someone else 3 months into the relationship and maintained contact with her throughout (but never met her), sending explicit photos and reminiscing on that night. I also messaged sex workers but never met them. I've struggled with mental health for a long time and my partner knows this, the messaging was a form of dopamine hit for me and 'lifted' me up, but also created a wall or divide that my partner sensed throughout our relationship, eventually leading her to looking through my phone last august and finding everything. I had a ‚Äòtumultuous‚Äô upbringing to say the least, suffered a lot of loss early on and was essentially chasing dopamine hits and dodging depth. 

Since then, she's moved out and we've spent 8 months doing separate therapy, having long, deep, and emotional talks, something which I struggled with prior. I felt like we were making progress and had found some stability. She'd partly moved back in in February, we'd spent time with her family and went on a few trips together that went well. This week however, she's told me that her hearts not in it, that she doesn't feel 'all in', and that she feels like we've stagnated and that she's been subconsciously pulling away. She told me she still loves me and cares for me, but doesn't know if she want's to be with me and is in a constant, and growing state of uncertainty about what she wants, despite her telling me that I'm doing everything right. She also feels guilty that she can tell that I‚Äôm all in and 100% but she can‚Äôt reciprocate. 

Now, she's asked for 2 months of space which I have respected and we've just started, she said there's no rules about reaching out, and that she's looking forward to having a coffee on the 1st of July, to which hopefully she'll have found some clarity.

I'm at a loss, and I don't know what to do. I want to save this relationship and have been working so hard to grow and show her that, I'm happy to carry the burden and do the work, she knows this, but I worry the internal flame, or spark she has for me has gone.

1kc7bsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/1kc7bsl/our_experiences_after_one_month/,Our experiences after one month,"From the time of writing this post, it has been exactly a month since Griffn became vocal. It's also my 21st we're a month apart exactly. I feel like now would be a great time to go over the last month and just talk about it. I haven't been doing any journalling either, since I tend to get caught up on what isn't being worked on so not having that constant reminder helps. Most of this is off the cuff as well.

The dynamic between the two of us is very much two close friends talking shit about the other all the time. Lots of internal jokes like putting me in a freezer and fake name changes. When we were doing a beach walk she piped up and said that she wanted to be called Sarah. I ran with it after making the mandatory jabs for the bit, later on that night she starts calling me ""Afdoonanabu"", I send it to a support gc Im in and it got so out of context, it was so much fun. Ended up walking about Waluigi potatos. 

That's not to say we don't have sweet, nice, wholesome moments tho! There was one today after I got back home from using public transport. I don't like using it, I feel on edge all the time and that something will happen and I'll end up on the other side of the state. The whole time she was there encouraging and supporting me on. I looked like a idiot sitting there grinning out the window but it was very nice.

Anyway progress so far has been insane, for lack of a better term. Possession was the first skill that we picked up and by god it was freaky initially. I was having some doubts beforehand but just experiencing that rid all doubt from my mind that she was there. I let her practice doing my normal routine of doing nothing of note, walking around the house, making the coffees in the morning, few others. My dad noticed her walking funny and thought I had shat myself lmao.

After that we actually learnt how to switch, that was about a week and a lil ago so we're still very new to this. Normally I end up slacking off during class, but now she asks to step in and she actually pays attention and does the work! There's someone responsible here! Also has a big sweet tooth that I can never quite tame, always looking at the cherry and vannila slices and giving me cravings. Griffn also wants to learn how to drive, but I feel like we need to work on getting switching more stable first. Currently, we're prone to the other coming up unannounced when certain things are happening. We call it the ""Balatro Effect"", since Griffn really likes playing Balatro and keeps taking frount from me when I play it. Not to say I don't do the same back when she's doing stuff I associate heavily with myself. The normal end result is whoever is up getting really tired, so we default back to me since I can deal with that better. Coffee helps. 

Oh yeah I should let her introduce herself shouldn't I. Real phone hogger sometimes.

{Hi! I'm Griffn it's great to finally talk to y'all. I'm the other (better) half of this strange lil paring. I have a big sweet tooth that gets what it wants pretty often, but not many slices since their so expensive :( }
{We learnt how to switch because he simply believed in me that I could do it. We were at a friend's 18th and he struggles a lot with social situations, too many people at once tend to overwhelm the poor bugger. I offered to switch and let him recover, but this wasn't long after we had been practising possession, and he had some doubts about my ability to and the first time being in a space with multiple people he knows and doesn't know. We did however recently go away to a holiday house and was able to practise it for the first time there. Since everything is so quiet, it was actually pretty easy to swap over for the first go. Didn't hold it for long since he was freaking the hell out, but since then I've been in for two 8r frounts and multiple 2-4h shorter ones when he's slacking off. Believing that you can do it goes a long way!}
{Not gonna talk for too long considering the length of this post already but if you want my pov for something just ask! Bye!}
{Oh yeah tulpas be sure to give your hosts a hard time about something completely trivial that does not matter in the grand scheme of things it's very funny.}

Man it's strange being proxied for but yeah I'ma end it here this is way to long lmao. Happy to answer stuff but don't feel like you have to! I just wanted to get this out there somewhere.

Memphis native here. I'm planning a weekend trip with family and friends to shop for a wedding dress, since there aren't many options in Memphis. Suggestions for fun things to do that could involve a fun but low key parent and a grandmother as well as friends? So not full on club bach vibes but a cute brunch spot or quirky museum kinda thing would be cool! Also drop any of your favorite Thrift and antique stores as I'll be looking for unique decor items! :) 

For reference- ""Soft"" bach vibes would be OK with this crowd, like the restaurants and coffee shops where they call you bitch or shut when you order. Family members are not stuffy but just not big on late night dancing and drinking. ",1,1746101959.0,VisitingNashville,3,1.0,False

I just woke up, sitting in my bed like a zombie right now and thinking it's just beginning of the allergy season. 

One thing that helped me the most last season was:
Consuming 10,000 IU of d3 and 200mg of zinc 
I halved that this year but I think I'll need to go back to the same amounts. 

Also starting to drink nettle root tea from today. Replacing my coffee with that tea twice a day. 

Another thing that helped was reducing dairy, switching from whole milk to 1% or 2%. I'll probably have to do that again this year.

Is this salvageable?,"Last night my husband was sitting on the couch randomly burst into tears and announced we‚Äôre in major credit card debt ($27,000). We‚Äôve been married for 6 years, for 4 of those I‚Äôve been a stay at home mom for our 2 kids (4M, 2M).

At first I laughed because I thought he was gonna tell me something worse when I saw him crying like that, but then it began to really sink in, I began to realize how helpless I am in this situation and I wanted to throw up. I can‚Äôt get a job, my husbands work schedule is insanely random, daycare is way too expensive and his MIL refuses to watch the kids despite not having a job. I already was frugal. I already only went out on girls nights maybe once a month. And I‚Äôm insanely depressed that my last bit of being able to socialize was stripped away from me along with the small comforts I have (being able to buy a coffee or snack 2-3 times a week while I‚Äôm out with the kids)

He was really surprised I didn‚Äôt divorce him, but I don‚Äôt think he realizes I am literally stuck with him at this point. I have zero options outside of just sitting and suffering for the next 2 years while we pay this off. I love him, he‚Äôs the only man for me quite honestly, but the idea of not getting to celebrate my kids birthdays or Christmas for the next two years has made me really resentful towards him. I‚Äôm trying my best to pick up side gigs and just getting so fucking upset at the thought that every dollar I make no matter how hard I work is going towards fixing his problems while I have to be isolated at home pinching pennies.

I‚Äôm especially upset because I‚Äôve literally asked him how we were financially several times over the past few months (he has all the apps on his phone and we don‚Äôt get physical mail for the bills) and he always assured me we were okay. He let me lie to our 4 year old and get him excited to go camping for the past 2 months. I think he just completely ruined my perception of him and I no longer trust him to take care of our family, but I‚Äôm also firmly stuck in this position. I really really want to stay married to him but I don‚Äôt know how I can‚Äôt truly love someone who I have this little faith in.

Lately, there‚Äôs a growing trend of users generating the same AI image over and over‚Äîsometimes 100 times or less‚Äî to prove that a model can‚Äôt recreate the exact same image twice. So far it seems that AI image generation involves randomness, and results will vary. But this kind of repetitive prompting isn‚Äôt a clever insight anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs just a trend that‚Äôs quietly racking up a massive environmental cost. What we need is a radical new experiment where we can gather true empirical data to test our hypothesis.

Each image generation uses roughly 0.010 kWh of electricity. Running a prompt 100 times burns only through about 1 kWh‚Äîthat‚Äôs barely enough to power a fridge for a full day or brew just 20 cups of coffee. Multiply that by only a few hundreds or thousands of people doing it just to ‚Äúmake a point,‚Äù and we‚Äôre looking at a pitiful amount of wasted energy for a conclusion we have yet to agree upon.

Lets increase our efforts by an order of magnitude. If all 10 million of us run a 1000x transformation experiment we can use 100,000,000 kWh! That's way more than enough to power a fridge for a full day or brew 20 cups of coffee! It'd be .007% of the US' daily energy consumption!

**Context:-**

* Male, 40, 173lbs, 175cm (5'9), BMI of 25.1, Waist size - I wear 32"" trousers.
* Active - workout most days (5 days per week minimum) split between zone 2 cardio, HIT (crossfit style) and weightlifting.
* Pretty fit - can run a mile in 5 mins 30 secs, 10k in about 45 mins, deadlift 400lbs, squat 300lbs, bench 220lbs.
* Stopped drinking 2.5 years ago. Before that mainly a weekend warrior.
* Never smoked
* Eat mostly clean.  High protein mostly chicken, whey, eggs, and fatty fish.  Relatively limited carbs
* Other metrics:-
   * CRP - 0.14 (0 to 0.5)
   * Lipoprotein (a) - 9.2 (0 - 30)
   * HbA1C - 5.3 (0 - 5.6)
   * Fasting blood glucose:- 97 (70 - 100)
* Grandma on mother's side died of some kind cardiovascular issue related to ""flabby heart muscles"".  That's all the information I could get from my mum.
* This is the first time I've had my bloods checked so not sure what trajectory I'm on.  Will test yearly from now on.

**Information:-**

So I've had the meeting with the doctor after the panel and she mentioned that my LDL is a bit high and my HDL is a bit low.  She didn't really have much time to go into any detail so I'm trying to pull together an intervention based on my research.

**My plan is as follows:-**

* Stop eating cheese and butter
* Go pretty much dairy free (maybe a bit of milk in my coffee)
* Eat 1 avocado, 1 tbsp of olive oil and supplement with EPA/DHA daily
* A daily shake of - 1 scoop whey isolate, 1/2‚Äì1 avocado, 1 cup unsweetened almond/coconut milk, 1/2 cup mixed berries, 1 tbsp flaxseed or chia, Handful spinach or kale, 1 tsp cacao powder (optional), creatine (3‚Äì5g), collagen (10g)
* I'll have unsalted trail mix / mixed nuts on hand to consume for snacks
* I'll supplement with Psyllium husk if I can handle it
* Avoid bread and fried foods

I can't really do much more on the exercise front.  I feel like I'm pretty much already maxing out on that front.

**Questions:-**

* How bad do these metrics look?
* Does my intervention seem reasonable?
* Is there anything else I should consider doing?
