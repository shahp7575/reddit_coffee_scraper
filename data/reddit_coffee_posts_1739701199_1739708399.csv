Just broke my left leg all because I wanted cheap coffee before seeing a student advisor about college admissions. I was going to use my fucking PT referral at my local ATI afterwards. You know, getting a job that's more suitable for autists tends to need higher learning. And I just finished my GED with very high scores! So I qualified for a free ride scholarship.

But now I'm increasingly worried that I'll never walk right again. Even before this I needed physical therapy because my muscles are weak and my entire left leg provided constant pain for years. The pain now is so much more horrible. My knee hurts more than the broken bones did when medicine wears off. I cried for the first time in years! For an hour straight according to my phone clock.

However, the hospital already wants me to get out when I only had PT once... If I fall there is no one to help me. There's no one to help me in most ways, because my roommate is essentially wheelchair bound and refuses to do physical therapy himself. The environment is also a health hazard. I'm ready to fight that and even fight my insurance because apparently I don't qualify for rehab. But they won't let me do more than 5 extremely painful steps after the therapists have to physically force my leg into a fucking boot. What the fuck? 

How can I come back from this? My chances at free workforce training or a degree are dying out as we speak, if I can't walk I can't sign up or go. I wanted to be able to run again, not hopefully get back to my painful baseline of suffering when I walk for more than ten minutes. Or trembling when I stand because of muscle weakness. I want to hike and take walks in the nature trail I live near. I would be willing to do acute rehab despite not being good enough for it because I know if I go home everything is going to fall apart.

I desperately want to be able to walk without constant pain like the past five years. I don't know. I guess I just want reassurance what with all the other shit going on rn. College/workforce training scholarships might not even exist anymore next month. The idea of this ruining my future is overwhelming.

1iqqvcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1iqqvcn/how_i_accepted_being_a_mom_already/,How I accepted being a mom already,"My baby is 3 months. Few days from now, he's going to be 4. Life was challenging for me. I cry everytime I hear him cry because I have no idea what it's like to be a mom and yes, I'm a first time mom. 

On his first month, it was so terrible. He cries every 2 hrs because he was breastfeed that time. Lack of sleep and tiredness in the morning is what I feel. Feels like I am not used to it. Every time he cries, I also cry because I'm worried he's not feeling well plus my mom is making me anxious telling me that my baby is not feeling well because of shrieking cry but turns out he just needs me and just needed to be fed. The 1st month was the hardest and thinking I am receiving little support from my family who is supposed to be my support system but turns out, they're the cause of my postpartum. 

2nd month was also the hardest but manageable. Same on his 1st month, it was terrible. T'was december when my uncle got home from abroad. He visited us but then I was not able to go outside. Don't know what's the reason of my parents. It's always them and about them why I am super stressed. Thankfully, my husband comforts me. We did mixed feeding so we could take turns. My sister is the antagonist this time. She keeps telling me I got pregnant earlier that's why I can't go enjoy myself outdoors but can't imagine herself she's worst than that. Yes, she's single but doesn't mean her life is happier than mine. I don't have work for the meantime but my husband can provide me what I want and I'm not lonely because somehow, I am on the recovery part. 

Now, he's 3 months. I can play with my baby and damn he's 6.1kg. His body is much heavier than before. I did pure formula feeding this time because he is not gaining weight with my breastmilk. Thanfully, he is good with the milk I chose. He can now carry his head, smile at me, and wakes up at 6am😂 The 8am that I used to wake up turns to 6am😂 baby knows I'm too lazy to get up lmao hahahaha. Ever since I formula fed him, everything went smooth. I can sleep better, eat what I want, drink coffee and have more time with husband. Also, it's convenient for us to go outdoors now since I already have baby carrier and also brought hands free bottle. I am so thankful of a supportive partner and a healthy baby. And finally, super finally, we are seperating from my parents. It can now give me peace of mind and away from my evil sister who always treats me as her enemy and always rage on little things and keeps mocking me. I am finally free! Planning to leave this 24th of february. There's no turning back. This is the final part of our decision and we're so sure about this. It helped me recover and go back to my normal life. 

Hope all of us mothers can survive especially those who are experiencing postpartum. We can do this! Just keep working on it, momma! ",1,1739707672.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

All of these are winter frags I guess.

1:-MUSIC CLUB(Jaz club replica)-This one smells a mix of neroli, lemon at upfront and the background gives the hint of rum.The frag during drowdown move towards tobacco and vanila.A good eveing time or party wear type.
Overall -9/10.

2:-LICORICE COFFEE(Ysl black opium)-The dominated coffee and vanilla mixture alongwith floral background is a good description for this.
Overall-8.5/10.

3-:MAGICAL SAFFRON(Byerdo black saffron)-Here the opening is of berries,saffron and grapefruit.The drydown moves towards Raspberry and vetivar.The leather smell is present in a good way in the background.
Overall-9/10.

4:-MILKY CARDO(Tom ford noir extreme)-
So this is my most fav from the set.A sparkling element is present inside the bottle to give it a nice look.Coming to the notes this is the most complex of all.
It has got saffron ,neroli,orange,kulfi,rose,jasmine,vanilla,sandalwood.
This can be that special frag with which one cant go wrong.A frag for special occasions.
Overall -10/10.

Longetivity——-Most of them stays on skin for around 2-3 hours and on clothes a good 8 hours.

Projection———A solid 2 hours of projection.Always go soft on the no of sprays with these.

Overall I wud say a good house to explore.
Reasonable prices,Louder frags and good longetivity.

I’ve been doing this for years, but since COVID, it feels like it’s getting harder and harder to make a meaningful profit for the hours I put in.

Costs are rising—van expenses, insurance - van, public liability, tools, calibration of tools, and  purchasing spare parts—and at the end of the month, after chasing late payments (which is a constant battle), I sometimes wonder what the point is. If I break down all the hours I work, including admin, weekends, and chasing invoices, I’m earning less than minimum wage. Remember, being self employed, we have no sickness pay, holiday pay or pension contributions from the employer.

Many customers push for cheaper rates, and I often end up caving in,  because I feel bad for them. My partner keeps telling me, *“You run a business, not a charity!”* But the worry is that if I charge more, someone else will just undercut me, especially new younger guys coming n the scene.

I was talking to an old mate—he’s a plumber 59 years old, and he said he’s looking to get out soon because the stress isn’t worth it anymore. He knows younger self-employed tradespeople in their 40's who feel the same.

So, my question is: **Are other self-employed tradespeople in the UK feeling the same pressures? Is this just how it is now, or am I doing something wrong—like not charging enough?**

If you haven't seen any of my stuff before then...

Hello, this is something you might have missed in Help Wanted 2.

**\[Removed to saved space\]**

Okay! Let's get back on track and make some more progress! Apologies for the gap between parts, but I needed a break and work on the script for the next video, something which thankfully was much shorter than the Roxy one.

However, it was the trickiest one I had to navigate to complete it though, because I lot of the stuff I *could* put in this remake of my Daycare Attendant posts, is stuff that's *in* my Help Wanted 2 post of Moon.

So yeah, *tricky*. But lucky, my post about the Daycare Attendant was mainly about him being a certified villain rather than about the dynamics of Sun and Moon and the Daycare Attendant's past and connection to Edwin Murray.

Anyway, that's done now, so I'll work on that video after this part is posted. But let's get into some updates on things as I've left pinned and unresolved things in some of the previous parts.

First, Vanny's [***flowers***](https://imgur.com/ZtuilZA)***.***

Yep, I surprisingly have an update on that. I honestly wasn't even trying to look for them anymore after I gave it a good try during the Foxy Log Ride parts.

But during the video editing of my Roxy video, I found out that these flowers actually appear in another game besides Help Wanted 2. In the most surprising place, I would've never would've guessed of finding it there.

On the desk in [Glamrock Freddy's Green Room](https://imgur.com/IbJWSj4) in Security Breach!

Oh, joy, was I was excited by this unexpected find when I first noticed it when I trying to get footage of the stuff in the Glamrock's Greenroom. I mean, you guys all know how **extensively** I went to try and identify this flower using the best screenshots I could grab from any video that has someone even glancing in its general direction.

So it's no shock I would immediately recognize it when I saw it. However, that excitement began to dim bit by bit when I noticed the pot of flowers was not just on Freddy's desk, but [Roxy's](https://imgur.com/1SB5I28) and [Chica's](https://imgur.com/6twVFSE) too.

Perhaps I was wrong about it being significant to Vanny if we were seeing it on every Glamrock's desk in their rooms. Maybe it was just a reused prop that Steel Wool decided to reuse for the Foxy level in HW2, which was where my thoughts were going as I checked each of the Glamrocks' rooms.

However, that quickly turned back around when I finally got to [Monty's room](https://imgur.com/z7j5ueX).

Yes, he too has that same pot of flowers sitting in the left corner of his desk just like the others. But what changed my mind about the significance of the potted flowers, was that this time, unlike the other pots in the other Glamrocks' rooms, the potted flowers were under an *eerie* [purple light.](https://imgur.com/qk63zHw)

This, of course, got the alarm bells **ringing** in my head as it looked like I *was* onto something with those flowers after all.

Still, with the discovery of these potted flowers in Security Breach, I knew I now had a better chance of getting a picture of what they actually looked like.

Well, long story short, nobody seems to pay attention to those flowers in their videos, so I decided to download Blender, find someone who modeled a recreation of the Glamrocks Green Room, and open it up in Blender.

Finally, after all these months, we know what these mysterious potted flowers actually looked like [from](https://imgur.com/PUhRTBS) [four](https://imgur.com/qAHXzBB) [different](https://imgur.com/PVrY812) [angles](https://imgur.com/beUDlrW)! (Ignore the circle thing, I'm brand new to Blender, so I don't know how to remove that.)

So, now that I have these, I can reverse image search them to find a possible name and species for them. But of course... *Things can't be that easy*.

Although I used various websites, I still can't seem to find a real-world counterpart that is 100% accurate to this potted flower we've been seeing in the games!

The best I can do is narrow it down to the most likely or closest comparison. So after a couple hours of research using various flower identifiers, reverse image searches, and lots of comparisons to the new screenshots I took from Blender, I landed on only one possible flower species that these potted flowers are supposed to represent.

* Tulipa gesneriana L., aka, the Didier's tulip, aka, [the Garden tulip](https://imgur.com/Mg7Plpk).

At a glance, you can see why the various flower identifiers think this is the species of the mysterious potted plant. It's a white flower with orange stripes on each petal with a thick green stem. However, at another glance, you can see why this clearly isn't the same flower as the petals are closed inward like a rose and not sprung out like the one in the game. It doesn't even have the correct number of petals...

However! I did manage to find a pic of the garden tulip with its petals open, and [well...](https://imgur.com/RgRQLGg) That is the closest I've seen to being an exact match to these potted plants in the games.

With that though, I've reached a dead end again regarding them. While the white tulip does seem to be the closest, it still isn't exactly 1-to-1 and I don't want to speculate on what possible meaning the white tulip brings to lore if it's not the right flower. So I'll be pinning this here, in case I find something else.

Also, fyi, it did occur to me that these flowers could be artificial and aren't based on a real plant. But there was always the chance it could have been.

As for the purple light in Monty's room... I'll save that discussing for his upcoming Ruin Prove It! video in the near distant future.

Let's see, oh right! I had mentioned that I figured out something else during that whole Glitchtrap and Jeremy revelation. Well sorry to disappoint you all but I decided to hold off on discussing it until we get to a certain minigame in HW2.

Trust me, it's going to make a lot more sense, why I held off on talking about it when we get to that minigame. To give you all a hint, it's about a whole bunch of characters.

Alright, one more thing before we make some more progress in HW2. Carnie and Baby from the last part.

It seems Circus Baby's reappearance and reintroduction into the new era is even more related to the plot of Help Wanted 2 than I originally thought.

At first, I thought the reason we're being shown that she really is the real Circus Baby and that she is in the network is specifically because she recognized Jeremy from her past, which in turn, helps us figure out that Jeremy has been to Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rentals before in the old era.

However, now that we all know the true plot of Help Wanted 2, that being Glitchtrap's plot to rejog Jeremy's memories while Vanny subtly tries to guide Jeremy to retrieve Glitchtrap's memories.

Baby's inclusion in this game deserves another look with that new information in mind.

This brings us back to that moment in Fazerblast: Western, where Carnie oddly interrupts the flow of the game and tells us, ""I got you a little gift."" Which as it turns out, ***was Circus Baby.***

So what am I picking up with this you all might wonder.

One topic I don't think I've discussed before is how Glitchtrap knows what Jeremy does and can't remember.

I mean, Help Wanted 2 hinges on Glitchtrap already knowing what Jeremy knows and not immediately killing him on sight when he's inside the ruined Pizzaplex or even down in the sinkhole.

Plus, the game only progresses when Jeremy starts to remember, and only ends when Jeremy remembers everything relating to the missing children incident. At least for the Glitchtrap ending of the game.

So Glitctrap has to know of Jeremy's past **before** Help Wanted 2 even started.

While some of you might be pointing to the Security Mask as an explanation, I don't believe that's the correct answer for this. While yes, from Ruin, we know the mask is capable of allowing Glitchtrap to access its wearer's memories. But I don't think it's capable of restoring memories that the wearer doesn't remember or is not at the front of their mind.

Like for instance, in Ruin, we see what Glitchtrap pulls from Cassie's mind through the Security Mask to be reflected in the AR world in Glamrock Salon. Cassie's, presumably, first meeting with Gregory, his disappearance after Security Breach with the missing posters, and her time spent with Roxy.

All of these things are at the front of Cassie's mind as she's in the ruined Pizzaplex because she's trying to save Gregory and she just encountered ruined Roxy for the first time before she headed deeper into Glamrock Salon.

We can even throw in that ""[Gone for a while](https://imgur.com/MkC59g0)"" note in ruined Glamrock Salon too even if I'm on two minds about it being either Cassie's memory or Jeremy's memory, (It could be a shared memory), because If I'm right on when Ruin takes place in relation to Help Wanted 2 then that's still a recent thing that would've been fresh on Cassie's mind.

So no, I don't believe Jeremy putting on the Security Mask before he went down into the sinkhole in Help Wanted 2 is what instantly gave Glitchtrap the knowledge of his past and forgotten memories.

I think Glitchtrap knows of Jeremy's past because of what happened between them when Glitchtrap first started appearing in the beta of the original Help Wanted.

To this day, Tape Girl's story of what Jeremy experienced when he encountered Glitchtrap for the first time has not happened again in the FNAF universe since then. (As far as I know, let me know if there's a Talesbook story about a character experiencing what Jeremy has.)

**“Jeremy complained of nightmares** when he came in this morning. **He wasn't talking about it like someone telling a friend about his dreams though.**—He doesn't even jump anymore, nothing scares him. **He just stands there like he's talking to someone.**"" - Tape 7

""The thing about it is that I don't think they were going to fire him because of anything he was doing wrong. ***They just knew he'd seen something.***"" - Tape 8

With the new information we've uncovered regarding Glitchtrap's appetite for *memories* and Vanessa's sister becoming Vanny through *merging*\*\*\*.\*\*\* Tape Girl's recounting of Jeremy's story reveals something that was hidden from us before.

Glitchtrap tried to ***merge*** with Jeremy in Help Wanted's beta development.

This explains why Glitchtrap is deeply familiar with Jeremy, his history, the gap in his memories, and why he would've held off on killing him when he finally returned to the now-ruined Pizzaplex.

Jeremy's nightmares, no, his **recollections** of past events in the old era, were being brought up again thanks to Glitchtrap trying to merge with him.

Like I said before, Jeremy knows Michael Afton, about William Afton, the missing kids incident, Both of the infamous Bites, Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rentals, and maybe even the aftermath of FNAF6. (Still pending on this.)

All that knowledge would've been something that William Afton knew himself, or at least would've been aware of from his own memories of those past events.

Wait hold on. If the ""like he's talking to someone"" part of Tape Girls story and Vanny's merging process was any indication, Glitchtrap *actually* succeeded in merging with Jeremy during the beta development. Well, at least partially as Jeremy doesn't seem to have had a personality shift like Gregory and Vanny.

Hmm... thinking about it more, Glitchtrap's merger with Jeremy sounds closer to Vanessa's infection from FNAF (AR) and even Cassie's infection in Ruin, where Glitchtrap is present and talking to his host. But nothing in Tape Girl's story indicates Jeremy was controlled by Glitchtrap like those two were.

Could the guillotine paper cutter be Glitchtrap's doing instead? Nah that doesn't sound right.

Jeremy would've been Glitchtrap's first test subject with his merging ability. He couldn't've been merged the same way Vanny was as the process that she went through wasn't created until Tape Girl took over beta-testing after him.

So it would have to be an infection, not a merger. That's *interesting..*.

Anyway, my point is that Glitchtrap had literally been inside Jeremy's head during the beta development for, what? A couple days? Tape Girl doesn't give us a clear timeframe for how long Jeremy was beta-testing when Glitchtrap appeared and infected him till Jeremy's impromptu face surgery.

But we know he went home once because he came back to work to complain about ""nightmares,"" and once again because Tape Girl found him in the testing room on another day's morning.

*""****I came in early that morning****, no one else was there. At least, that's what I thought. —I didn't even notice Jeremy standing in the testing room as I walked past.""*  \- Tape 6

That's at least two whole days that we can infer from Tape Girl's story where we know that Jeremy was infected by Glitchtrap. A whopping ***48 confirmed hours*** for Glitchtrap to get to know Jeremy's memories.

And know that there are a couple of gaps between each of them.

Anything before the Bite of 87 is basically a roulette for whether Jeremy remembers it or not, which is basically FNAF4's CC story and situation along with FNAF2's story.

Actually, we know Jeremy doesn't remember, or at least entirely, CC's bullying and the first Bite, because he barely remembers the bonnie mask he was wearing when those things happened in HW2.

So that leaves FNAF1, FNAF3, Sister Location, and FNAF6.

Nothing indicates so far in Help Wanted 2 that Jeremy was there for FNAF1 and 3, and FNAF6 is a maybe as he could've been aware of what happened rather than being there.

Leaving us with Sister Location, and oh, what do you know, it's the most prominent game to be featured in Help Wanted 2, and the one that we know he was there for now through the drawings in the Helpy Aid and the recognition from Circus Baby.

And since, Jeremy ***remembers*** Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rentals, **knows** the passcode to ***The Private Room*** you can get to in Sister Location without Vanny telling him. Jeremy's job at the Sister Location would've taken place ***after***  FNAF2.

So looking at the timeline of FNAF with that additional information, the order of events would've had to go like this.

FNAF4>FNAF2>FNAF1>FNAF3>FNAFSL>FNAF6>Help Wanted and the start of the new era.

FNAF4 placement has to be the start thanks to CC's story officially taking place in '83, the earliest a game takes place in the timeline before Secret of the Mimic releases.

Now I've heard and read some arguments about it also taking place after FNAF3 due to some FNAF1 phone calls easter eggs, but I haven't truly looked into it myself, so I'm sticking with this for now.

But what does this all have to do with Circus Baby?

It's simple really, she's just another tool that Glitchtrap can use to stir up Jeremy's memories.

Jeremy can't remember the events of FNAF2 and before that. I don't think he truly can anymore as regardless of miraculously surviving the Bite of 87, it doesn't change the fact that he received some significant brain damage from that event. Memory loss is the primary symptom you can expect from any form of brain damage really.

But what Glitchtrap can do is use things in the AR world relating to FNAF2 and the missing children incident to help Jeremy recollect bits of those lost memories.

Like the **Charades!** Help Wanted 2 is Glitchtrap playing Charades with Jeremy! A bit of an oversimplification but it works!

For those not familiar with the Charades game and can't be bothered to Google it, it's a game that takes 2 or more players in which the players take turns acting out a word while the others try to guess what that word is!

Some of the minigames in Help Wanted 2 are there because Glitchtrap is trying to get Jeremy to focus on things that would relate to or encourage him to follow a particular line of thought that goes back into his, no, their past and remember things, aka, the missing children.

And what do you know! A quick Google search reveals that Charades is a good game for people who have memory loss!

Whoops, I did not mean to get sidetracked with all of this. Let me start to wrap this up as I think you all got the gist of what I'm talking about here, but if you don't, just think about what we're going to do in the Fazerblast: FNAF1-2 minigames and how that gameplay mimics the actual gameplay of those games and how someone who's experience being in a situation like that would remember it.

So how does Carnie fit into this? Honestly, I'm leaning toward him being a Glitchtrap proxy. I've noted before that he seems to be reacting to Jeremy's presence as if he's actually aware of Jeremy coming back to these minigames.

But this ""gift"" situation, along with the fact that the game doesn't tell you that the Plushbabys were going to be featured in this minigame and that ***this gift is actually Circus Baby,*** has, to me, pushed Carnie, as being an agent of Glitchtrap or at least a digital entity that's under him.

Like I said before, I'm going to keep a close eye on him and his dialogue in the future as Carnie has oddly become a very interesting figure in Help Wanted 2.

Now, one more thing before we get back to Help Wanted 2, I forgot to tell you all about it in the last part, but where do you think the Fazerblast minigame takes place in the Pizzaplex?

Because I think I have an idea as to where Jeremy might be in the real world during this minigame.

To keep this short, there is a [fenced-off](https://imgur.com/q3Lfsbf) area in the Pizzaplex down in the maintenance tunnels, that oddly resembles a set replicating the Curse of Dreadbear DLC asethic for Help Wanted. I don't remember anyone mentioning it that much over the years since Security Breach was released. But it's weird that it's there in Pizzaplex with seemingly no answer as to why.

Actually, now that I'm looking through the maintenance tunnels, there are a couple other fenced-off areas down there that resemble minigames from Help Wanted too... Hmm... That's something to look into later.

Alright, let's get back into the game!

""There's a special **gift** for you on the stage."" Is the comment you saw Helpy make on the projector screen to your right once you returned to the restaurant and happened to glance that way. (Carnie talks about a gift, and Helpy talks about gifts, it's just a coincidence isn't it?)

Whoops. You've totally forgotten about Helpy. Looks like you've kind of got lost in the flow of completing one task after another and haven't been paying much attention to your surroundings. (My bad, I was kinda in a rush. But you get this next Faz Force figurine after you complete DJ Music Time: Advance.)

Walking up to the main stage, you quickly wound up the gift box and watched the top pop off from it, revealing your new Faz Force figurine in the form of Bionic Bonnie. (Sooo, it isn't following the pattern of the Faz Force commercial then... Okay, what's the pattern here?

Freddy, Foxy, Bonnie, Chica, Marionette, Golden Freddy. Is it the order of the children's death? No, that doesn't fit at all. Maybe in reverse? That sounds more likely. Let's pin this for now, I can speculate on it later.)

Taking a moment to inspect it, you placed it on the second pedestal underneath Foxy's before heading back to the computer to see what the next task for you to complete was.

Opening up the Fazcade Folder, you saw that you only had one task left to complete in the AR world, Bonnie Bowl. (I thought there was another minigame besides Bonnie Bowl in this Folder. I must be thinking about one of the hard/ruined mode exclusive minigames.)

It was time.

Although cautions, who wouldn't in your position, you were really looking forward to checking this one out, more than any other task, you would say.

Opening up the pop-up window for Bonnie Bowl, you read the summary of it with anticipation.

""Bowl like a VIP in Bonnie's Private Lane. Fun!"" (What kind of summary is this? Why does it sound so weird, unlike the others? Well, that's not true. Pizza Pizza Pizza food court minigame, still takes the slice for being the weirdest.

It's just the oddly placed ""Fun!"" addition after the sentence that's throwing me off as it would've read better without it.)

One click of the TUTORIAL button, and you were back in its void, reading through the instructions on how to do the upcoming task.

""Bowl to get a high score!""

""Watch out for random challenges!"" This warning came with a pictogram of Plushbaby walking on a bowling lane. Looks to you, like it won't be simple bowling in Bonnie Bowl after all.

That line of thought only changed when you got to the last advice for the task.

""Use the flashlight to keep Moon away."" (Neat, the first and only minigame as far as I'm aware where both Moon and Circus Baby toy with Jeremy together. Let's see if there's anything interesting here.)

Plushbabys and Moon?! This wasn't going to be fun at all.

Slapping the START button with some trepidation, darkness took you from the void and dropped you off in a hallway-shaped bowling room, complete with a single bowling lane with two purple lights following parallel along its length and with large purple, blue, yellow, and green glow sticks plastered along its walls that all gave radiance to the room as it extended out from where you currently found yourself standing.

The room looked to have four doors in total, with pairs of two on opposing sides of the lane with a Bonk a' Bon poster appearing next to the first one on the right that's opposite from an opened door that led to darkness. (This is probably how Jeremy physically entered this room.)

Two screens hung from a platform close to the ceiling, facing slightly away from each other. The left displayed the total scoreboard while the right seemed to show some animation with anthropomorphic Bowling Bonnie and Glamrock Freddy-themed bowling balls along with the title ""Bonnie Bowl"" between them.

Above the screens, the [actual ceiling had a huge hole in it](https://imgur.com/z22PxEn) where you could see the piping system of the building. It looked like something had ploughed straight into this room from the ceiling judging by the way some of the ceiling panels and wires were bending into the room. (Hmm... I wonder what happened here. Steel Wool could've modeled this the opposite way with the panels bent upwards to imply that Moon or whatever did this had ripped into the ceiling from above it to get into the room.

But Steel Wool didn't and it truly looks like punched through the ceiling. But what and why? Oh right, the Pizzaplex is ruined! That is probably something that's really there in the real world of this private room.)

To your left was a stand with a Fazbear Entertainment-branded black flashlight and a monitor displaying with Bonnie Bowl Logo and play button. To your right was the bowling ball dispenser which currently had no bowling ball dispensed out.

Behind you was... interesting. While one wall was bare of things, even the glow sticks, the other had three things lined up against it. Starting closest to you, there was a five-tier divided storage cabinet occupied with pairs of bowling shoes except for the last two spots with three spare bowling pins sitting on top of the cabinet.

Next was a bowling ball rack, which held many varieties of bowling balls that range in colors and patterns. You even spotted a Freddy-themed one on the top right. (Don't let Burntrap see that or else it's going to be planted in a wall or something.)  

Lastly, there was another five-tier divided storage cabinet with the only difference that you could see from the first one being a golden trophy sitting on top of it instead of bowling pins.

But that stuff wasn't the most interesting thing behind you, no, that had to go to what was behind a coffee table.

It was a white or light grey couch, that [held for occupants that sat and watched you from afar](https://imgur.com/w8iiycn). Classic Freddy, Funtime Foxy (FNAF2's Mangle), Toy Chica, and Glamrock Roxy, all in plush form, sat with food and beverages as if they were a couple of friends hanging out to watch you play.

Classic Freddy had a blue straw cup with an energy symbol on his right, Funtime Foxy sat contently with nothing while Toy Chica had what looked like a Sodaroni can on her left with a whole pepperoni pizza sitting between her and Roxy.

It didn't look like that pizza was on a plate or anything, so you hate to be the one who has to clean the grease of it.

But taking in everything, it looks like you're going to entertain them with your bowling skills, and knowing the threats that were coming soon along with the task, you bet you were.

Okay, the question here is if this is Vanny-related? To be honest, there's a lot of stuff here that could be a potential link back to our crazy murder hobo bunny girl.

The pepperoni pizza is her favorite, the Toy Chica plush is her favorite, that blue cup with the bolt symbol is something we've seen in her room and the Endo Warehouse, and while she doesn’t seem to have a specific preference for beverages, that red soda can is something she would drink.

Not to mention that this is ***Bonnie Bowl.*** A place that is literally right next door to her room. A place that we know she's very familiar with as she's the one who stashed the scattered [Sewer Bot pieces that destroyed Glamrock Bonnie in his Green Room](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/17xjkhp/ive_found_glamrock_bonnies_killer_i_can_prove_it/) and hid him away in that secret room.

So like I said, there's a lot to link her here... Which is probably why I might shock you all when I say I don't think all this stuff is meant to hint to us that Vanny was here.

It's hard to explain, but let me try.

From all the times, I've found these items in an area with Vanny's presence, they were all posed in the environments as if in use. Like for example, the Toy Chica plushie, the blue cup straw drink, and the pizza.

In Ruin, we find the Toy Chica next to Vanny's bed in her room in Fazerblast, it was out of place, near some books that were also bedside, and wasn't there in Security Breach. All implying that these things were of personal interest to her.

In Security Breach, we find that [same blue cup](https://imgur.com/ZDecTfW) in the Endo Warehouse on a desk that Vanny was using doing whatever she was doing in there, implying that she was drinking it.

And in both Security Breach and Ruin, we can find pizza boxes in various areas where she's the most active or has graffiti of pizza slices that expresses her love for it. Implying that she's eating it or craving it.

Here in this Bonnie Bowl minigame, none of those implications fit the scene of the plushies and food on the couch. There's no space for anyone to sit on the couch which also means that no one was sitting there in the first place.

None of the beverages were on the coffee table, which if anyone was drinking them, would've set them there so they wouldn't spill anything when they move on and off the couch.

And every time, we've seen pizza lying around in the Pizzaplex in Security Breach and Ruin, it's always been in a box, not just out in the open like we see here, meaning this stuff on the couch is just there by Steel Wool or the in-universe Help Wanted 2 game for props with no further meaning.

So yeah, nothing to see here, back to bowling!

Turning back around, you finally decided to stop putting off not taking note of the most obvious object of interest at the end of the bowling lane.

[It was a giant Bonnie head](https://imgur.com/EH5QFlZ), well, not completely. Its lower jaw was missing and with its head so low to the floor it made it seem that its missing jaw was either under the floor or was the floor itself.

Its eyes were the usual maroon that Bonnie was known for having, except it glowed distinctly in the darkness at the end of the bowling lane. From where you stood, it looked like it resembled Glamrock Bonnie, but it was hard to tell.

Yet regardless, of which variant of Bonnie it was supposed to be mimicking, something about it looked off to you.

With nothing else to see, you pressed the start button on the apparent touchscreen monitor on the stand to your left to start the bowling game.

The screen then changed to display the bowling pin formation and the scoreboard for your first turn. Immediately, noise from the Bonnie head drew your attention to it as it tilted its head back to show you the bowling pins that it was hiding inside its half-mouth while the bowling ball dispenser spat a standard 3-hole bowling ball for you to use.

The bowling ball in question just so happened to be a Glamrock Bonnie-themed one. (Fazfact: The bowling balls are randomized.)

You picked up your new favorite bowling ball all while bowling music started to play throughout the room. Once you had gotten a proper grip on the ball using its holes, you gave a few test swings with it as you focused on lining up a shot for a strike.

With one last swing, you released the bowling ball and watched as it tiled towards the left before smashing into the left side of rows of bowling pins, wiping out seven pins on the line before the Bonnie head tilted its head back and the music cut off.

Looking towards your left at the monitor's screen, showed the results of your attempt at a strike. Not bad since you were a little rusty, but you could do better than that.

The Bonnie head tilted its head back again, revealing to you the three remaining pins that you needed to knock down as the dispenser gave you a Chica-themed bowling ball this time.

Let's see if you can get a spare...

(Skipped because there's only **one** thing I want to talk about here.)

From flashing Moon, dodging Monty Golf Gator hazards, and rolling the Plushbabys down the gutter, getting a strike kept getting pushed down on the list of priorities for you as you watched the right hanging monitor load up the next hazard for you.

Suddenly the screen switched to a familiar black screen that displays the hazards for Bonnie Bowl and your brain took a minute to finally register what your eyes were seeing.

It was a picture of the Bonnie head at the end of the bowling lane except its eyes were blue instead of maroon ... How was that a hazard?

Suddenly, a noise brought your attention to said head as you noticed that its once glowing eyes grew so vividly brighter that it made the previous glow of its eyes a dull luster.

What's going on?

Sounds from the dispenser, made you glance towards it as it all of sudden started to spit out multiple bowling balls for you to use. But before a question could even form in your head another noise pulled your eyes back to the end of the lane.

And what you saw made you panic.

The Bonnie head had abruptly started to move up the lane. Its forward momentum was caused by it chomping its way closer to you.

What do you do? What were you supposed to do?

In a flash of clarity, you looked towards all the bowling balls the dispenser gave you as you reached out for one as the chomps got louder.

You grabbed one, but it slipped out of your hand in your rush.

Chomp!

Chomp!

You went to grab a second one but you accidently pushed it off to the side of the dispenser.

Chomp!

Chomp!

Chomp!

Finally, you firmly grabbed a Freddy-themed bowling ball and got your fingers in the 3-holes to get a good grip on it.

Turning to face the giant Bonnie Head, to your great fear, you noticed it was about a couple chomps away before it got close enough to take a bite out of you.

Yet in being so close, you got to notice the distinct [black stripes in the corner of the eyes of the giant Bonnie head](https://imgur.com/hy7aF5G), making this Bonnie head a larger replica of Glamrock Bonnie. But more than that you finally noticed why it looked off to you.

It looked like **him**.

It had his face.

The thing that appeared as a costumed yellow Bunnyman with half-lidded purple eyes, vest, and tie, with an open-mouthed smile that *never went away.*

Here it is!!! The thing I've been waiting forever to tell you all about!

Before I posted my review of the HW2 on the subreddit, before I even started this deep dive, from the very first time I got to see [Bonnie head move closer](https://imgur.com/HXehGPe) to the screen during GTlive's playthrough of the game, my mind for some reason immediately pointed out to me that it looked like Glitchtrap's face!

I couldn't figure out why my mind thought that, but I believed it. It was just something about it that kept triggering my Glitchtrap recognition function. So after waiting until we got to this part in the deep dive, I decided to finally see why that was by comparing these two bunny's faces.

That's when I saw that it's the shape of the head without Bonnie's lower jaw and hair, the positions that his ears are in, and the general crooked direction of each of his individual whiskers. It looked like an 80% match with Glitchtrap's own features.

But that's not enough for me or even you all probably. So I did one more thing to make sure I wasn't seeing things, that I wasn't just jumping the gun on this. One simple thing that could help further prove something I've discussed before in my ruin deep dive and my Bonnie Prove It! post.

I overlayed [Glithtraps face with giant hairless Glamrock Bonnie's.](https://imgur.com/nxsV13Z)

It. All. Lines. Up!

Never, ever, did I think I was going to get a soft confirmation on my theory about Glamrock Bonnie being a Glitchtrap replicant in Help Wanted 2! That's crazy!!!

I mean I thought we were going to get more clues about Bonnie's death, but not about any of the replicant stuff. (We did get some more clues but I'll talk about it at the end of the deep dive as it doesn't change much from what I'm going to say in my video remake of my Bonnie post.)

Now, before all you doubters come at me, let me be clear, I wouldn't have taken this as confirmation of Bonnie being Glitchtrap's replicant if it wasn't for Steel Wool intentionally giving this giant Bonnie head Glamrock Bonnie's distinct eyeliner.

Because without that, I would've assumed that this was some generic Bonnie head for the minigame.

But since they did, it means they wanted us to know that despite the lack of hair tufts and headband, this giant Bonnie head is supposed to represent Glamrock Bonnie.

So if the **representative** of Glamrock Bonnie looks almost 1-to-1 with Glitchtrap, what exactly do you think Steel Wool is trying to tell us?

If it looks like a duck\~

But anyway, that just about wraps up what I uncovered from Bonnie Bowl. Well, except for this slight [Eclipse cameo](https://imgur.com/XvEYIXy) whenever its Moon's turned to be a hazard.

Back to the game.

After throwing enough bowling balls to reset the Bonnie head to its original position, rolling the Plushbabys down the lane and into the gutter, and flashing Moon enough times to give him a seizure, you were just about done with Bonnie Bowl and its lethal hazards.

There was almost no room in your panic heart to enjoy your score of 104 before darkness returned you to the GAME WON! Void where you took a moment to gather your breath and calm yourself.

Pressing the button on the capsule vending machine, you grabbed and opened your capsule to reveal your prize which turned out to be Glam Bonnie. Weird, how come he's not fixed? (Consequence of thorough wreaking by Glitchtrap Jeremy, that's why.)

Pressing the RETURN TO HUB button, your thoughts lingered on Bonnie and the *other bunny.*

Okay! Let's end this here as I think I reached the Reddit word limit. But get ready everyone, we're nearing the end of line for Help Wanted 2! What **more** could there be?",1,1739707151.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False

This past recent week I found blood in my stool, when I was pushing I had felt a little constipated so seeing the blood didn’t really scare me? When I wiped it was bright red as well as blood in the stool. The following day when I wiped there was small (very small) amount of blood, as well as the next day so 3 days in a row. 

This past week I’ve been having inconsistent bowel movements, diarrhea, stringy poop, or just nothing. Yesterday I didn’t poop all day, I had to drink coffee to make myself go. And today I didn’t poop at all again.

I’ve also been feeling fatigue for the past few years. I sometimes feel like I can’t explain how fatigue I feel but I don’t have energy to do much but work or force myself to cook meals.

I’ve been analyzing my behavior and I fart A LOT. Like a lot I’m just farting like everyday. 

I feel like I’m always bloated. It’s been like this for 2 years where I’ve been dealing with crazy bloating I will look 3 months pregnant.

For context last year I had went to get a health check up and talk about the same concern I saw. Blood in my stool last year! I was dealing with constipation as well etc. I was brushed away.

1iqqkht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Umrah/comments/1iqqkht/not_here_with_pics_but_advice_and_tips_based_on/,Not here with pics but advice and tips based on my experience (Jan 28 - Feb 8),"PSA: these are just some of my experiences when I was in madinah and mekah. I'm privileged to have come from a country where things were a lot more accessible and convenient for ladies compared to when I was in both cities (three, including Taif). I may be wrong in some aspects as these are only anecdotal recordings, nevertheless I hoped that this would be helpful for those planning for their trip to umrah in the future. I apologize in advance for my English as it is not my native language. Sorry for the long post too. I had so much to note down as these may have been the kinds of information that I have missed out when doing research on my own.

Thank you for those who have gotten in touch with me when I was hesitant to go for the trip. I will not disclose on how I felt, but I would say that I was in a survival mode throughout my 14 days stay there. This is the best that I could do in helping others. Feel free to ask any questions.

 

**General advice**

1. **Weather:** For reference, I’m an adult in a middle schooler body. Taif was quite cold for me. Madinah was windy and cold in the morning but it got hot and sunny from 11am onwards. Mekah was bloody hot from morning till night. Pack accordingly.
2. **Bring a small bag to fit in walking/sports shoes and slippers together.** In any mosques, I would change from shoes to my slippers, keeping my socks on (or wearing tawaf shoes when in Masjidil Haram). I would only wear my shoes again when I'm exiting the mosque. I brought a drawstring bag to carry most of my essentials and it was a lifesave rather than wearing a bagpack or women’s bagpack.
3. **Use the conversation feature in Google translate** for live translation of jumaat khutbah. It's a bit slow, but it worked pretty alright just to get the gist of it. What I noticed was that the khutbah was read out straight from the Quran, as I recognize which tale it was from. This was entirely different from the khutbah that we've had in our home country, with some social-related content incorporated in it. 
4. **There are 2 kinds of azan here.** The first one is announced between 30 mins to 1 hour before the actual prayer time, as a reminder for people to be aware of the upcoming prayer. The second one is the real azan for that particular prayer. You might get confused at first, like how I was when I rushed things to catch the jemaah. Be mindful of the time. 
5. **Both madinah and mekah were equally crowded** when I was there. The thing that made it so exhausting to walk around was because people was standing around in the middle of the street. Locals opens cloths to sell their stuffs in the middle of the way. So everything is holed up because people being people, which is really testing our patience. Flash sales for abaya etc were the cheapest after subuh in mekah. 
6. **Make sure you make ample research on the hotel**, especially if you're relying on travel agents to arrange it for you. Dream Zone Hotel (Mekah) was quite far from Masjidil Haram and the pedestrian walk was so bad for wheelchair, thus not recommended. Olayan hotel and Snood Ajyad hotel had better walkway for wheelchair. On the other hand, Jawharat Al Rasheed Hotel (madinah) was close to Nabawi Mosque, flat walkway and had ample lift so that guests don't have to go to war for it. Both hotels had great food, though. When booking hotels in Madinah, I suggest that you look for places around Taiba Hotel Suites, Movenpick, Hilton etc as they are nearer to women’s prayer areas (gates 328 and above). Women’s prayer halls are ridiculously far if you come from the main gate (gate 310), please have mercy especially if you have anyone who may have trouble in walking far distances.
7. **Uber:** our TA brought us to visit a few places, but we still utilised Uber to go to other places that we wanted to. Another option would be Careem (need SA number iirc), but uber was easier as **I can link my Wise card** instead. However**, the whole Masjidil Haram area was off limits** **for pickup** as they would want visitors to take their taxis instead (you need to haggle). I made Tawfiq Plaza Hotel as the nearest pick up point from out hotel. **Make sure you plan your time wisely as price hike happens when it is near prayer time, thus cars are not allowed into the Haram area.**
8. **Always keep your skin moisturised.** The weather was fine when we went. Hot in the afternoon but can be windy and cool at night and in the morning. My eczema flared up so badly that I have to keep reapplying layers of moisturisers. Use vaseline to keep your skin from cracking. 
9. Everyone would be coughing or sneezing everywhere so **please wear a mask at all times** (except when performing prayers and Umrah of course). It's easy to catch a cold or develop a sore throat with the changes in weather on top of exerting energy performing ibadah. My tip of keeping fit and active throughout the trip was to occasionally take paracetamol (650mg) every other night or on days with packed itinerary. I always have my sore throat spray with me and spray whenever I feel even the lightest scratch in my throat. Works wonders everytime, better than just sucking on sore throat lozenges. If you do plan to bring anything like spray or lozenges, do bring extra as the pharmacies charge ridiculous prices for the things that you need (my sore throat spray was 65 SAR and there was only one brand sold across different pharmacies).



**Madinah (general)**

* **Food:** had a culture shock where food was sold for to-go. We didn't do much research on restaurants etc as our hotel provided full board meals. But if you're like us who would like to dine in somewhere, I'd recommend that you find some cafes operated by hotels (e.g. Golden tulip hotel coffee shop). Starbucks that I went to (Mias hotel) had a quiet lounge to chill at. There were many people giving out meals as sabeel after Friday prayers so you can save on getting lunch. Still, finding a nice spot besides the mosque was challenging for us.
* **Quba mosque:** take a buggy for 10sar/pax from Ghamama Mosque or vice versa. It's only 10 mins ride. Women's area for prayers and wudhu are pretty near from the buggy drop off location. Personally, it was the nicest mosque in terms of how the women's area was designed, albeit the wudhu area is considered as small (and you'll have to go to war when it's crowded on weekends). There's an immersive museum/exhibition based on the Prophet's time and how the normal life looked like in the past. There are also coffee shops and ice cream shops nearby to chill out. 
* **Ghamama Mosque:** take the chance to pray jemaah in this mosque, as women can join too. Jumaah prayers follow imam from Masjid Nabawi. Only open for jumaah prayers and closed at other times. 
* **Saidina Abu Bakar & Saidina Ali mosque:** these mosques are only open for men. 
* **Uhud syuhada mosque:** take the uber to the mosque to pray sunat and to view the historical place of Uhud War.
* **Madinah Hop On Hop Off city tour bus:** spending 80 SAR/pax was worthwhile as we could go to the Uhud Battlefield (Uhud Syhada mosque), Qiblatain mosque and Quba mosque  as well as seeing what Madinah looked like beyond the area we stayed near Nabawi mosque. The ticket is valid for 24 hours, and we managed to visit all of those mosques at least twice. If you’re interested in other attractions, you are entitled for discounts for some of them (eg Prophet Muhammad’s biography museum Madinah).

 

**Masjid Nabawi**

* **Women's WC (toilets):** they are ridiculously far, which you may only see from gates 320 or door 13 and above. Even so, WCs are opened and closed at any time so this was very inconvenient for us to go down and take wudhu or do our business. Especially so when I have trouble keeping my wudhu for extended periods of time. I took my wudhu at one of the WCs for asar then found out that it was closed when I went again before maghrib. So be prepared to run around finding open WCs like all the time.
* **Women's prayer hall area (inside):** Door 15, Door 25. Many would i'tikaf inside so both areas quickly fill up for prayers. There are areas for women with and without children. Door 15 is almost always full, so you might want to walk way further behind for Door 17 or 25. If you're lucky while you're in the halls from doors 15 or 17, you might get to watch the roof uncovering the vast blue sky.
* **Rawdah:** I managed to book a slot before the trip. The slots are quickly filled up but you can try your luck with the instant tracker while iktikaf in the mosque. Make sure to screenshot your qr code in case you lost Internet connection during your appointed slot. Please don't panic if the staff couldn't scan your qr code, as they will try to enter your code manually. That was the case for me and many others in my slot, but alhamdulillah majority of them managed to pass through. 
* **Bring a foldable spray bottle** for when you break your wudhu and you cant leave your spot in the prayer hall. Renew your wudhu easily with the spray, make sure you have a small cloth with you to wipe the water on the floor (they will catch you if you don’t).

 

**Mekah (general)**

* If you’re like us who enjoy mosque hopping, consider the following mosques for Jemaah prayer with the imam from Masjidil Haram. Pros is that you have a smaller war to go to, immediately go for coffee or meals, nearer WC to take your wudhu. No cons from my experience.
   * **Royal Orchid Hotel Musollah, Safwa Tower:** find signs for the hotel from the main entrance. (if you're eating at the food court on level 4, it's on the same floor). take the lift from hotel lobby to level MP (masjid). Men's prayer hall oversees Masjidil Haram. Jumaah prayers follow imam from Masjidil Haram. 
   * **Fairmont Hotel Musollah, Clock tower:** walk straight on GF until you see Giordano on your right. take the lift to level M2. Ask at the concierge for the lift to musolla (level S2). Another place to pray, but not high enough to see kaabah from above (this is possible if you're a guest at Fairmont hotel and pray on L29). Jumaah prayers follow imam from Masjidil Haram. 
   * **Masjid Abu Bakar, Hilton tower:** find KFC (near King Fahd Gate) and take the escalator all the way to the top. The entrance is the men's prayer hall (level 4), or take the stairs to level 5 for the women's prayer hall. Pray jumaah together with the imaam from Masjidil Haram.
* **Prophet Muhammad's biography museum, clock tower:** the mekah branch is a bigger one (70 sar/pax) while the madinah branch in nabawi mosque is smaller (40 sar/pax). You may book for a guided tour of 50 minutes based on your preferred language. When entering clock tower mall, take the escalators from ground floor to P2 and you'll be immediately greeted by a huge sign for the museum. The gift shop is open for viewing as well (which tbh feels like it's own museum).
* **Sabeel:** we did sabeel on behalf of family members through Nur Malaysia restaurant at Safwa Tower (Level 4). The staff (Soleh & Adam) were friendly and helpful with assisting with the process. They can prepare food or drinks and display them for whoever who wishes to take it. This approach was easier for us rather than buying things and sending it around ourselves.
* **Al Sarayah Laundry, Snood Ajyad Hotel:** we chose this one as they offered 10sar/kg for washing. Wash + iron is 15sar/kg. Opens after subuh until 6pm, self send and self collect.
* **Jabal Nur, Hira Culture District:** no fee, freely hike up. it was a 2-hour hike for us at midnight, thanks to our mutawwif arranging transportation for those of us interested in going (tbf we did it very slowly). There were many people, the trail was doable but be warned that nearing the peak, it got a bit more challenging. Nevertheless, do hike up as it offers a great view of mekah. We went at night, so it was a beautiful scenery of the city lighted up, so lively. There's a pit stop at the beginning of the trail to get a quick bite or drink pre or post-hike.
* **Clock Tower viewing deck:** we tried booking for a viewing slot through this website and they claim to send a confirmation email for attendance. Unfortunately, there was no news up until the date and time of the booked slot. We only received an automated email with a ""request code"". You may go to P9 at Clock Tower for more info.
* **Kakiyyah Wholesale Market:** take the Makkah Bus 11 for 4 SAR to get to the market if you'd like to save on the transportation and your TA doesn't bring you there. The whole area offers discounted prices for souvenirs, but I heard that the fish market offered better prices than the Wholesale market. We only stopped by for a bit as we weren't interested in buying anything to bring home. If you were hoping to find similar abaya etc that you’ve seen at other places (eg Hudaibiyyah, Jabal Rahmah at Arafah etc) and haggle here, you can forget about it. They don’t have it. In other words, I regretted not getting the abaya that I wanted at Jabal Rahmah lol. As I was only interested in getting abaya, sellers open their prices at 60 SAR and you’ll need to haggle for lower. Also, most places accept only cash.
* **HHR Train to KAIA:** we took the train from Mekah HHR station to Jeddah International Airport, just to check out the train and the airport (we landed at Hajj Terminal instead). There was a huge price difference between the one at the counter and on app, cheaper on app and the ticket machine by 20 sar (69 sar). You don't need to create an account to book your tickets and you can pay with Visa. Once you've paid, you'll receive an email containing your tickets. The train station was huge and very pretty, but lacked some important human factors elements. One, there was no indicator for departure platform numbers at their respective escalators to the waiting area. Second, the waiting area lacked train schedule and other important details for visitors to refer to (surprisingly, they had this for the departure waiting area at the airport). We were expected to listen to the announcement for the call to platform for our train. This would be unhelpful for those with hearing impairment. Third, visitors cannot take wudhu at the prayer room for some reason, so it's advisable to pray at the airport or somewhere else that you needed to be. Otherwise, everything else was fine. We had a quick snack at Danube Dash, a supermarket and they serve pastries, food and beverages. The train ride was smooth, the whole interior was very good. 
* **Hajj & Umrah terminal, Jeddah Airport:** the area was huge with 5 zones (zone A-E). each zone has a few eateries to enjoy while waiting for your check in time. Each waiting area has a space for prayers and you may take your wudhu in the respective WC just next door. If you need to use the airport trolley, you need to pay 3 SAR each. There’s a bag wrapping service starting from 25 SAR (possibly for 20”). There’s also a kiosh where you can purchase a gallon of zam zam water for 12.50 SAR each.
* **Wadi Berkat, Hudaibiyyah.** If you plan to go to Hudaibiyyah mosque for miqat, I suggest that you stop by here as opposed to going to war in the mosque. There is a proper place for men to change into their ihram. There are stalls open selling meals and snacks. A great place to chill. Once youre ready in your ihram, go back to the mosque, do your niat and pray sunat prayer for umrah.
* **Dining at P3 & P4 Clock Tower:** prepare to go to war when finding a place to sit on these two floor for lunch and dinner. We managed to secure a table right before Isya’ prayer (granted, only my dad went for Jemaah prayer while mother and I walked around the mall while waiting for him). Food could be very expensive, even for fast food chain. If you’d like to have a burger, the cheapest would be from I’m Hungry. Chick Mix had the cheapest/reasonable priced pizza. B Laban offers very nice ice cream and the price is reasonable for the serving. Get drinks from the hypermarket instead.

 

**Masjidil Haram**

* **Always check the black information screen to get updates on the gates.** I cant stress this enough. They change the entry gates for different purposes at any time throughout the day. For example, in the morning, the gate for performing umrah was opened at Gate 79, but in the evening it was changed to Ajyad Gate (Gate 3, in front of WC3). This also affects which gates are opened for jemaah prayers as they will block certain areas at any time. Always always always check the information screen as everything can change anytime. I find that the general information being shared around on which gate to go to etc isn’t always applicable now.  
* As of Friday (7 Feb) **Gate 89 was opened for level 2 tawaf**. It was opened since morning and the tawaf area was slowly closed off for those performing tawaf sunat to make way for other people coming in to take their place in saf for jumaat prayers. If you're planning to perform tawaf here, please be mindful of the subtle things that could easily cancel your tawaf (e.g. Your left shoulder facing away from the kaaba). The whole tawaf area was full by 9.14am. 
* **Buggy service for saie:** 50 sar/pax (cash/card), had the experience of sitting back while focusing more on my duas and zikir. We took up the offer when all of us started to feel achy and sick, but still wanted to finish one round of umrah. You may find a green coloured booth at the beginning walkway to Safa, ask for the staff to guide you to a lift that'll bring you to the designated floor (6th floor). It's hard to describe it into words.
* **Women's WC4 & 5:** this is the main toilet and wudhu area. Most people go to war with the toilets on the basement level 1. Pro tip is to go to another level lower which is less crowded and cleaner. Theres a specific area for wheelchair users when you enter the WC. WCs in Masjidil Haram itself was always closed whenever I need to use it.
* **The best time to perform pilgrim is midnight and right after subuh prayer.** The crowd will always be there but it was a lot more manageable for us rather than doing it after zohor (as we went to Ja’aranah for miqat in the morning, and our mutawwif suggested us to perform umrah right after zohor).
* If you plan to perform tawaf sunat, it would be great to do it right after subuh prayers. You can complete 7 tawaf in just 45 minutes.

It has been retaining more and more grinds, often putting 18g in only gets 16.5-17g out. I can tilt and slam the grinder a bit, and get some out. Sometimes I have to add more beans to top up, which means some day in the dose will end up being significantly over. Most days I have about 1g of ground coffee that ends up not getting used because of this.

I like the flat burrs and the flavor I get from the Specialita. It's really the workflow and retention that I don't enjoy. It's also quite an effort to clean if you're going to take it apart to clear the intenrals, otherwise it's just grindz and hope.

Every time I order a coffee or go to the supermarket, people speak Italian to me and even though I can understand what they’re saying some of the time, I don’t know how to respond, so I look at them with a lead paint stare and a small smile on my face, like a catatonic little elf. 

I try to feel more confident and look more confident but I have become so self-conscious and feel like everyone must feel so bad for me or can see how much I’m struggling. I’ve become really shy and awkward. Sometimes people look at me weirdly or even make comments that are probably light-hearted but make me feel even smaller. And I know it’s the anxiety making me think they’re looking at me more than they are. 

I would like to embody the spirit of a normal adult and not the spirit of womp womp, the spirit of a lettuce sandwich, the spirit of a pelican in an oil spill. 

I came here to learn Italian but now I don’t even  know why I chose to do that. 

Even my home friends are at best busy and at worst totally unavailable and not present. 

I’ve moved country before, been through this exact thing, and it was fine eventually but only because of luck, so there’s no telling if I’ll be that lucky this time.

1iqqif8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1iqqif8/the_games_they_play/,The games they play…,"I (33f) have been happily single by choice for over two years now, after a stream of constant disappointment in my dating life.

I really don’t want a man in my life and have been keeping my distance from men outside of family and a couple longtime friends.

However, there’s an old colleague I’ve known for about a decade. We always got along well but never had a deeper friendship because he was in a long term relationship, so the idea of the two of us hanging out alone just never crossed either of our minds. I thought he was a great guy but didn’t fancy him or want anything more from him, and he treated me in the same way.

We have remained in touch, connecting about once a year, through a phone call or texting for valid reasons such as work networking opportunities, or references, and I’ve bumped into him once or twice and we always have a nice chat/phone conversation before parting ways. 

Two years ago during our ‘annual chat’ it came out that he had broken up with his gf about a year prior. I said I’m sorry to hear that and we talked a bit about how awful modern dating is. He slid a complement about my looks into that convo (which he’s never done before) and asked me out for coffee. That was the first time I had a realisation that actually we could be a good match. I ended up going travelling and our coffee never happened.

We didn’t speak again until another year later (last month). This time, I asked him out for a coffee. He picked me up and we ended up going for lunch (he paid), and hung out for a while just walking around. I had a really nice time, and he texted me afterwards saying he had a great time and we should go out again soon. I agreed.

…..and since then he has started replying to my messages inconsistently and sporadically, sometimes taking more than two or three days to get back to a casual message. It’s been a week and he hasn’t suggested a date for us to meet up again. I haven’t either because I’m getting a bad feeling from his sudden change in behaviour and honestly I have zero tolerance for the anxiety I get from when men behave like this. 

I’m just wondering what on earth they are all playing at? He’s been so chilled and cool this entire time, and I know I have never actually known him on a very deep level but he would always answer my calls straight away, text back straight away, whilst remaining respectful of his gf at the time and not crossing any lines.

I’m about to give up on him. It’s a shame because it kind of ruins the relationship we had for all these years and once again I just feel disappointed. At this point, if he does ask me out again or reply to my most recent message, I don’t know if I’ll even want to respond.

1iqqg9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1iqqg9t/how_do_i_prevent_getting_too_attached_and/,How do I prevent getting too attached and dependent on my boyfriend?,"Hi I 16M and my boyfriend 16M have been together for 2 years. I'll admit that we have been quite a toxic couple for a long time but it's changed now. My boyfriend used to be really jealous of the fact that I have friends i go out with (i am gay and my friends are mainly women) I also do have male friend's but im not interested in them, obviously. I used to argue with my boyfriend daily about really small things but it's changed nowdays. I had a talk with him and he agreed that we were really toxic. I know that the road this is headed to is the obvious ""break up"" but seriously our relationship is really complex and I love him he loves me back just as much and even though it's been toxic we've also made the greatest memories. He's been my support ever since day 1 I met him at a coffee shop and we had a lot of eye contact. I had the balls to go approach him and the rest is history. When we first started dating I thought I found the love of my life I mean every moment with this guy was everything i could ever ask for but a few months in he began to change and it got toxic. He never hit me but he'd be really jealous, think i was cheating on him or just straight up start arguments over small things. I learnt a lot of things such as I had to stay up till 3 am(or later) to make sure he was asleep after an argument, If he was showing me through text that he was upset I would have to ask him many times what's wrong and reassure him that I care and that I won't leave him for anybody else. But weirdly sometimes hes sometimes just ""chill"" and texts me in a tone where I can obviously see he's sad and then will get mad at me if I keep asking him what's wrong. So basically i have to guess which one it is either he's texting me as if he's mad/sad because he's chill or because he wants me to ask him what's wrong. It brought many arguments and problems but i learnt to just suck it up. I'd say that the entirety of out relationship up until around December 2024-february 2025 I've been a really submissive partner who always just went with everything. I loved him and whenever he showed me affection he was always so sweet with it he apologized for he he acted towards me and then things would be okay for a few days and then another thing would bring us to shambles. During these times I was sickly attached to my boyfriend if he was upset I was upset if he was sad I was sad. Let's say that I have a bad day and he texts me, he's had a good one then my mood would immediately be uplifted because his is uplifted. My mood depended on him all the time and Everytime he'd be mad at me or if something was up I would physically feel my heart tearing apart its a gut wrench I never want to experience again. I had this feeling almost daily for a year straight I remember crying almost daily too because of him. But i loved him and I still love him so I can't leave him (saying this because I don't want anyone to tell me to). Anyways so since December i got in contact with my friend who I've known since 2020 and he's also gay and he has a boyfriend. Whenever I saw them interact or my friend talking about him I kept questioning my own relationship but I lnever said anything. I got close with my friend his name is James M16. I eventually began asking James questions such as ""you're not nervous about asking your boyfriend that?"" ""Does he really just not care if you fall asleep accidentally?"" ""Won't he be mad at you?"" ""Are you allowed to have friends without him being jealous?"" And etc. James eventually realized that something was up so he just bluntly said that he hated my boyfriend. That was when I asked him why and he told me it was obvious i wasn't in a good relationship. I told James we loved eachother because we really do but he wasn't having it, it turned into me telling James more and he kept trying to get me to break up with my boyfriend. I didn't want to since he was starting to treat me well there but it got bad again a few days later as usual. I was so attached to him I hated it, James helped me so much. He taught me how to be more independent he hyped me up on my worst days and he really helped me with my self worth. This is what had me pull away from my boyfriend in late December. I started to call him out on stuff that didn't make sense such as him allowing to do something but when it was me who did the exact same thing I would be the bad person. I remember that for the first time i didn't have this insane guilt, anxiety and gut wrench in me whenever he was upset and angry. I felt weirdly free? I could eat without throwing up and it felt so nice. But today i think I'm getting attached to him again? I've began to feel anxious since he's back to texting me in a way where i can tell he's not okay. I ask him what's wrong but he's just telling me he's chill he just messaged me that he's crying and stuff but idk what to do. I already told him i want space earlier since our conversation was just so exhausting. I don't know how to stop getting attached to him again I'm scared of it i dont trust that i will ever be able to be independent like I was in December and January. I am just scared of breaking up with him I don't want to because I know I'll never find love. I don't want to wait years to find love again i want to experience the teenage love I'm experiencing right now. I know the things I've written about him make him look like a complete dick but I promise he's geniunely such a sweet guy once he's loved enough. I've loved him for 2 years and I don't want to break up with him. He makes me incredibly happy and he just has a lot of family and mental health issues. That's not his fault so I'm just sticking by his side and loving him because he deserves it. He makes me beautiful and thoughtful gifts, he writes about me lovingly in this cute journal his sister bought for him and he shows me love by also giving me sweets and a lot of heart shaped stuff often. He compliments me and is physically affectionate. But right now I can just see our relationship going downhill again and this time i can feel anxiety usually I'm chill and I handle it fine by being logical. Now I'm anxious, scared and I have no desire to eat which really scares me i think I'm getting attached again. How do I prevent it and keep my attachment issues from making me too dependent on him. If i get too dependent I know this will turn into a major shitstorm. I am not sure what his issue is I've tried asking but all I get is that ""he's just chill"" and so on. But he just texted me that he's crying aswell!? So he obviously lied about being chill. How do I keep my vulnerability in check i don't want to attach myself to him again. I want to love him but from a distance where if he's spiraling i can be there and not spiral with him.",1,1739705905.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

1iqq8dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMyBusiness/comments/1iqq8dp/does_google_rating_affect_your_business/,Does Google rating affect your business?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve developed an AI tool that analyses your business’s Google reviews and quantifies how each aspect of your business impacts your overall rating and revenue. In simple terms, if you get a one-star review for poor service, my tool calculates exactly how much that review is pulling down your overall rating and it breaks this down by specific feedback themes. Research shows that a 1-star increase in rating leads to roughly a 10% increase in revenue.

The dashboard updates daily as new reviews are added, so you can track trends over time and see which areas are improving or declining. For example, in one analysis for a café, the tool identified that negative feedback on service caused a 0.1-star drop in the overall rating, and it pinpointed the top reviewed products (Steak, Pastry, Wine, Coffee, Dessert, Sandwich, Chicken) along with their revenue impact.

I’m looking for a few business owners to test it for free in exchange for detailed, numerical insights into your business’s performance from your reviews. If you’re interested in a demo or would like me to run an analysis on your Google listing, please DM me your business’s location on Google Maps. Your feedback will be invaluable in fine-tuning the tool.

Here’s a 2-minute demo video on Vimeo: [Sashy Demo: Quantifying Google Reviews’ Impact on Revenue](https://vimeo.com/1057221207/a486779c8f?share=copy)

I quit Coffee for about two months mostly to prove to myself that i could.
Didn't notice many direct physical Changes. But I think i kinda used Coffee to not eat for extended periods of time and to Work on Projects without taking a break (being hyperfocused). 
So after Quittung Coffee my mental health improved and in Turn my physical health too.

I used to Always Drink a Coffee in the morning before eating anything and while working in Something. 
So after being Clean for two months i thougt it would be okay to drink Coffee again in the afternoon with company from time to time (German cake and coffee)... I thougt as Long as I wasnt abusing Coffee on an empty stomach I would be okay..... Well.. I'm Back to doing exactly that :(

I want to quit again but this time it feels a lot harder. I used to have an eating disorder in the past and my mind ist screaming at me, that I will get fat and unproductive if I Stop drinking Coffee. I think because of this thoughts its even more important to Stop. But I feel Like Im not gonna be able to (maybe because I failed before)

My face looks the same as it always does: pale, tired, and just a little bit pissed off at everything. My green eyes—yeah, those tell the real story. There’s a dullness in them, a hollowed-out look like someone scooped out whatever made them shine and forgot to fill them back in. I run a hand through my short black hair, more out of habit than anything, and think for the millionth time: *Fuck my life*.

With a sigh, I yank the fridge door open and grab a vanilla protein shake. The label promises twenty-five grams of protein and “natural flavors.” Nothing natural about it. This stuff tastes like someone blended chalk and despair, but the macros? At one hundred calories, with no added sugars, low and carbs and that protein number? Unbeatable. I close the door and shuffle to the coffee station.

The coffee smells like burnt rubber and old dirt, but it’s strong, and that’s all I need right now. I pour myself a small cup of black sludge and glance at the guy behind the counter. He’s maybe eighteen, acne-scarred, and glued to his phone. Probably scrolling TikTok or something.

“Protein shake, coffee, ten on pump two,” I say, slapping a crumpled twenty on the counter.

The kid grunts, punches some buttons, and hands me back my change. “Have a nice day,” he mutters without looking up.

I almost laugh at that. *Nice day. Sure, buddy.* Instead, I just sigh as I scoop my change off the counter and into the pocket of my winter coat.

Outside, the wind punches me in the face, and I huddle deeper into my down coat, pulling the hood tighter around my face. The beat-up Honda Civic parked at pump two is technically mine, but only because my sister’s away at college and can’t stop me from borrowing it. I really need to get my own car. Back in New York City, I didn’t need one. Nothing beat the convenience of public transportation. Not that I missed the interesting people I’d occasionally see on the subway to-and-from the office. *Christ, anything goes on the NYC subway.*

I pop the gas cap, shove the nozzle in, and lean against the car while the numbers crawl up. I gingerly sip from my cup of caffeinated sludge. My protein shake is tucked under my left arm. Ten bucks doesn’t get you much these days, but it’s not like I’m going anywhere glamorous. *Just another day in paradise*.

Once the tank’s full—well, not full, but not empty—I slide into the driver’s seat, tossing my bottle of protein into one cup holder, and the to-go cup of coffee into the other. The car groans to life, and the heater coughs out a breath of lukewarm air. Snow covers everything, the streets are a patchwork of slick ice and crater-sized potholes. I navigate around them like a drunk slalom skier, the car rattling with every bump.

Save-Some-Bucks comes into view, its large, red neon sign flickering like it’s about to give up on life, which feels appropriate. I glance at my phone. The screen reads January 16^(th). 4:57 a.m. Right on time.

A second car pulls up next to mine, a dented old sedan that’s seen better days—probably in the ‘90s. Dave steps out, the store manager, his breath puffing white in the cold. He’s a short man in his fifties, balding and with a blond goatee. He waves, looking way too chipper for this ungodly hour. I sigh again before killing the last of my coffee. I should be nice to Dave. He’s a good guy.

“Morning, Joe!” he calls out.

I grab my protein shake, kill the engine, and step out into the cold. “Morning, Dave,” I mumble, already dreading the next eight hours.

It was too damn early for a Friday morning. My boss at my old job had a saying: T.G.I.F.—“The Grind Includes Fridays.” *Fucking prick.* I plaster a smile onto my face, which freaking hurts in the bitter cold air.

Dave grins like it’s the best morning of his life, his gloved hands fumbling with the keys. “Cold one today, huh, Joe?”

“Yeah,” I reply, shoving my hands deep into my pockets. *Because that’s exactly what I want to talk about, the goddamn weather*.

The lock clicks, and Dave swings the door open. A gust of stale air greets us as we step inside. The fluorescent lights buzz as Dave flips the master switch. One by one, the rows of overhead bulbs flicker on, casting a pale, soul-sucking glow across the store’s aisles. It’s the kind of light that makes even the freshest produce look sad.

“Another beautiful day,” Dave says with way too much enthusiasm. Some mornings, I want to ask the store manager what makes him so constantly positive. But then I realize I would rather *not* open that can of worms. I’ll just assume it’s some kind of prescription anti-depressants, or the guy has a smoking hot wife at home, and get on with my day.

I grunt in agreement and head toward the back. The break room is as depressing as ever—gray lockers, a folding table with mismatched chairs, and a coffee machine that looks like it’s been brewing regrets since the Reagan administration. *I’ll stick to my gas station sludge, thank you very much*, I silently joke to myself.

I hang up my winter coat and hoodie, revealing the hideous yellow polo that Save-Some-Bucks forces on all employees. It’s tucked into a pair of black Dickies work pants that are slightly too tight around the waist. I miss hoodies already.

I clock in and grab a broom, starting my usual sweep of the store. The floors aren’t terrible, but Dave has this thing about “first impressions.” So, I humor him. The delivery truck doesn’t arrive for another thirty minutes anyways. I push the broom down one aisle after another, half-assing it just enough to look busy. Then it’s on to the shelves, cleaning off dust and pushing items to the front, clearing empty boxes and moving product forward so the shelves all appear full. It’s mindless work, but that’s kind of the point.

By the time the truck arrives at 5:30 a.m., I’ve broken down a dozen cardboard boxes and rearranged a shelf of soup cans that no one will probably buy. I walk to the back of the store, unlock the large, sliding metal door and push it up with a rattling hiss. Right on schedule, the truck is there. The delivery guy hops out, clipboard in hand, and I sign for twelve pallets of groceries, produce, frozen, and dairy. Another guy brings them into the backroom of the store, which quickly becomes cramped for open space. I thank the two guys, who hop back into the truck and peel off to their next delivery.

I turn around and survey the various pallets, each stacked above my head and wrapped tightly in plastic.

Time to throw stock.

I move the pallets around as best as I can with the help of a pallet jack before I start breaking them down. I pop a pair of wireless headphones into my ears, pressing play on my phone to continue the podcast I’ve been listening to. It’s a live-play of the popular tabletop roleplaying game *Swords & Sorcerers*. This particular podcast, *High Rollers Club*, is more focused on ridiculous antics and comedy. It reminds me of the games I used to play in high school and college.

First, I use a box cutter to tear away the plastic on several of the pallets. Then, I begin stacking boxes on dollies and organizing everything into neat little categories. On the podcast, one of the hosts, playing a barbarian, is yelling about honor as part of some bit while I’m wrestling with a case of frozen peas.

At 7:00 a.m., the store officially opens. The sound of the automatic doors kicking on is like a death knell. I know I should take my headphones out—company policy and all—but screw it. It’s not like I’m working the register today. If the customers leave me alone, I’ll leave them alone. Fuck company policy.

The morning drags along as usual until a voice cuts through the epic battle happening in my ears. Interrupting a critical roll of the twenty-sided die.

“Joey Sullivan?”

I pull one earbud out and look up. Standing a few feet away is a guy about my age, twenty-seven or so, wearing jeans and a puffy winter jacket. His brown hair’s a little longer than I remember, but that face . . . *Oh no*.

“Uh, yeah,” I say, already feeling my stomach lurch.

The guy smiles. “It’s Matt! Matt Carter? . . . From high school?”

Of course. *Why wouldn’t this morning get worse?*

“Oh, hey, Matt,” I say, forcing a grin. *I totally remember who you are!* “Yeah, sorry, just surprised to see someone from high school here.”

He laughs. “No way, man! It’s been forever. What are you doing here? You move back to Cleveland?”

“Yeah, around the holidays,” I reply, scratching the back of my neck. “Just working here for a bit, as a favor to my dad. Picking up a few shifts while I’m, uh, applying for work in the area.”

I try to sound casual, but the words taste bitter. *This is humiliating*.

Matt nods. “That’s cool, man. I thought you were still in New York. What happened? Weren’t you doing something big out there?”

“Yeah, I was,” I say quickly. “Just, you know, time for a change.” *Please stop asking questions.*

Matt doesn’t seem to notice my discomfort. His gaze flicks down to my arms, which are squeezing against the tight sleeves of the Save-Some-Bucks polo. “*Woah*! . . . I didn’t know how ripped you got after high school. Look at those pythons!” He jokingly reaches out and squeezes by bicep. *Please, don’t touch me.*

“Yeah,” I say lamely.

Matt chuckles. “Well, it’s good to see you, man. We should catch up sometime.”

“Yeah, sure,” I lie.

He waves and walks off, pushing a cart full of frozen pizzas and other junk. I shove my earbud back in and crank the volume, letting the podcast drown out the embarrassment buzzing in my head. One of the hosts just rolled a 1—a critical failure. *I feel you, buddy.*

Just a few more hours.

By the time my shift ends, my body feels like it’s been through a wood chipper. My shoulders ache, my back’s stiff, and my hands are red from dragging pallets and breaking down boxes of product. No wonder my dad is always bitching about his back. The freezing air outside is almost a relief as I step into the parking lot and make my way to the Civic.

The drive home is quiet. Snow blankets the streets, turning everything into a lifeless gray. I take the long way, winding past Lake Erie. The water’s dark, choppy, and endless. Back when I was a kid, I used to love this view—there was something awe-inspiring about the vastness of the lake. Now it’s just . . . there. Still, something about driving down the highway alongside the lakefront was comforting.

I pull into the driveway of my childhood home, a small one-story house on Cleveland’s east side. Suburban living at its finest! The place looks exactly the same as it did when I left for college—faded blue siding, a sagging front porch, and the same bushes my mom insists on trimming every spring.

The front door creaks as I push it open.

“Joe, is that you?” my mom calls from the kitchen.

“Yeah, it’s me,” I reply, kicking off my boots by the door.

She appears in the hallway, wiping her hands on a dish towel. Her graying hair is tied back in a loose ponytail, and she’s wearing an oversized sweater that probably belonged to my dad twenty years ago. Her face lights up when she sees me. “How was work?”

“Fine,” I lie.

She looks like she’s about to press for details, but I slip past her. “Dad still at work?”

“Yeah, he’s got a late meeting,” she says, following me into the kitchen. “You hungry?”

“I’m good, thanks. Gonna hit the gym first.”

She frowns but doesn’t say anything. Instead, she watches as I head down to the basement.

The guest room I’m staying in is as uninspiring as the rest of the house—bare walls, an old dresser, a small desk, and a twin bed that creaks if I even look at it wrong. My old bedroom upstairs had long ago been transformed into my dad’s office-slash-mom’s crafting room. He built a desk where my bed used to be, complete with drawers labeled things like *Yarn* and *Glue Sticks* for my mom*.*

I shrug off my yellow polo and toss it onto the bed, replacing it with a plain gray t-shirt and a pair of black gym shorts. My laptop sits on the corner of the desk, its screen still lit. My resume stares back at me, the words “Senior Associate, Summit Lake Capital” mocking me.

I walk over and scroll up to the blank space under *Employment History.*

I almost type “Clerk – Save-Some-Bucks,” just for the laugh, but my stomach twists at the thought. Instead, I shut the laptop, cutting off the glow. *Out of sight, out of mind.*

Back upstairs, I grab the blender bottle from the drying rack and mix up my pre-workout—an angry red powder that tastes like artificial fruit punch and burns going down. And *boy* do I love it! The second bottle gets my protein and BCAAs (branch-chained amino acids), a “cookie” flavored powder that I mix together with water and some powdered peanut butter.

I glance at the clock. Still enough time to hit the gym before the after-work crowd shows up.

“Heading out, Mom,” I call, shoving both bottles into my gym bag that sits on the floor near the door. “Don’t wait up for me. I’ll be back for dinner.”

“Okay,” she says from the kitchen. “Drive safe. It’s slippery out there.”

“Always do!”

I step outside, the cold biting at my skin, and load up the Civic. A shitty day deserves some heavy-ass weights, and I’ve got plenty of stress to burn.

\# # # # #

The neon *Diesel Athletic Club* sign buzzes faintly as I pull into the half-empty lot. The place is a dump—cracked asphalt, rusted light poles, and a front door that looks like it’s barely hanging on. But it’s my kind of dump.

No fancy towel service. No endless rows of Peloton bikes. Just sweat, iron, and the occasional sound of someone grunting like they’re fighting off a wild animal. Old-school and unapologetic.

When I step inside, the familiar smell of rubber mats, chalk, and faint mildew hits me. It’s quiet. No one else in sight, not even Steve, the gym’s owner-slash-mechanic, who’s usually around fixing the broken treadmills. Perfect. Nothing beats an empty gym.

I toss my bag into a corner, lace up my lifting shoes—an old pair of high-top Converses—and start stretching. My body groans in protest as I work through a few dynamic stretches—lunges, toe touches, some half-hearted arm swings. Then it’s onto the foam roller, which hurts like hell but works out the kinks.

Leg day. *Time to suffer*.

By the time I’ve finished a couple of warm-up sets with light weights, my pre-workout is in full effect. My face tingles, my heart feels like it’s auditioning for a drumline, and every muscle in my body is screaming, *Let’s go.*

I start with prone hamstring curls. The machine’s padding is worn down to the foam, and the cable squeals with every rep. I knock out four sets of ten to twelve, focusing on the squeeze at the top. My hamstrings burn, but it’s the good kind of burn—the kind that tells me I’m doing something right.

Next up: hack squats.

I load the sled with a couple of plates and step in, making sure my feet are just the right distance apart. As I lower myself, I focus on depth, keeping the weight light and my form tight. For years, I was built like a human ice cream cone—hilariously round up top with legs that barely filled out my jeans. Not anymore.

Now, I love the way my legs feel strong, powerful, capable of pushing the kind of weight that used to intimidate me. Four sets of eight to ten reps. By the last set, my quads are on fire, and the sweat’s dripping off me like I just ran through a car wash.

As I rack the sled and step off, my legs tremble beneath me, and I can’t help but grin.

This is why I come here. To push, to burn, to fight against the voice in my head that tells me I can’t. Because here, in this crappy little gym, with its broken machines and peeling paint, I can remind myself that I’m still capable of more.

And leg day? Leg day’s just a reminder that sometimes, you’ve gotta carry the weight.

Finally: barbell squats. The king of all leg day exercises and the reason I’ll be limping tomorrow. I load up the bar—two plates, then three, then four. It’s heavier than I’ve pushed in months, but I need this.

The first set catches me off guard. The weight feels like a mountain pressing down on my shoulders. My legs protest with every rep, and my form isn’t as tight as I want it to be. I rack the bar, panting.

“Get your shit together,” I mutter under my breath.

Second set. This time, I picture everything I hate.

Being back in this freezing wasteland of a town. Living in my parents’ basement, surrounded by all the remnants of a life I thought I’d outgrown.

I drop into the squat, thighs burning, then explode back up.

Anger fuels me. I pour it all into the movement—every ounce of frustration, every simmering resentment. By the time I rack the bar again, my hands are shaking, and sweat drips into my eyes.

The third and final set.

This time, I think about the people I’ve been avoiding. High school classmates, running into me at the grocery store, smiling politely while they silently judge me.

*Oh, Joe’s back in town. Didn’t he move to New York? Wonder what happened there.*

And then there’s the social media. They must’ve noticed—photos of her disappearing one by one. Girlfriend, then fiancée. Then deleted, gone like she never existed.

My teeth clench as I drop into the squat. The bar feels impossibly heavy, but I don’t care. I drive through my heels, legs screaming in protest, and fire out of the bottom position.

“Goddammit!” I growl, slamming the bar into the rack with a deafening *clang.*

The weight settles, but I don’t. My chest heaves, my shirt clings to my skin, and sweat pools at my feet. For a moment, I just stand there, staring at the bar, completely spent.

Time to re-rack the weights and move on to an hour of incline treadmill walking. Not glamorous, but it’s part of the grind.

I grip the first plate to pull it off, but before I can, the entire room shakes.

At first, it’s subtle—like the vibrations of a passing train. But it builds, the tremors growing stronger, the floor buckling beneath me.

“What the fuck?” I whisper. My head fills with a strange, deafening white noise, like static turned up to eleven.

Earthquake? No way. Cleveland’s about as seismically active as a rock.

A stroke? Maybe, but I’m still standing, heart hammering, sweat dripping.

The shaking stops abruptly, leaving an eerie stillness in its wake. That’s when I see it.

A screen.

It’s not in front of me, not exactly. It’s like it’s burned into my vision—a translucent, blue-tinted glass hovering just in front of my eyes. Neat, white text begins to scroll across it, perfectly legible but utterly foreign. The text is accompanied by a voice in my head—softly feminine, yet strangely mechanical.

**Stage 2 Planet, Designation: Earth, has been selected as the venue for the next God Game.**

“What the hell…” I mumble, my voice trailing off.

The screen doesn’t care. It continues:

**You have been selected as a Participant. All Participants will be entered into the Game. If you choose to accept, you will be one of the first inhabitants integrated into the Interdimensional Uniform System. To accept your selection as a Participant, you must enter and complete the Profile Creation Process.**

The words blur together as my brain struggles to catch up. *God Game? Interdimensional System?*

**You have one minute to accept. A portal will appear following this message.**

And then, the final line, delivered with chilling precision.

**Welcome to the End of the World.**

1iqpw13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqpw13,Tips to spice up makeup on blue eyes,"Hi everyone,

I am looking for ways to experiment with my eye makeup and add some variety to it.

Lately I have been using brown shades to accentuate my eyes because I think they do a pretty good job with it. I’ve heard blue eye liner or eye pencil may do the same. 

Last night I decided to combine the two: added some brown eye shadow on the upper eyelid and filled in the interciliary space with a coffee shade and applied some blue eye pencil and eyeshadow on the lower one. List of products is available in the comments.

Maybe I am being too critical of myself or maybe it was some brown eyeshadow on the lower eyelid (I added it initially when applying some liquid eyeshadow for base) but I am not sure if I did the lower eyelid right.

Looking for your tips to use blue eye pencil and eyeshadow shadow and also any advice to up my eye makeup game.

Thanks in advance

1iqpuk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1iqpuk7/strength_based_wizard_prologue_the_trickster/,Strength Based Wizard - Prologue: The Trickster,"Freedom tastes like starlight, bitter and electric on my tongue.

I skate across the cosmos, savoring the chill of the void beneath my feet, the way it bends and bows to my whims. For so long, I knew only darkness—an eternity locked away in some forgotten corner of the universe, the bars of my prison forged by hands more ancient than my own. But even the mightiest chains rust, and now here I am, trailing mischief across the stars. *And just in time*.

The others are waiting. I can feel their collective unease prickling against the edges of my awareness, sharp as the first breath of winter. They know I’m free. They know what that means. And it thrills me. I drag my hand through a stream of cosmic dust, scattering it behind me like ash, as the wide coyote grin spreads across my face.

They didn’t want me here. That’s why they caged me in the first place. Too unpredictable, they said. Too dangerous. As though they’ve ever been any better. Hypocrisy, thy name is godhood.

I mentally reach out using my *awareness*, feeling the presence of my brothers and sisters. I anchor my intent to their location, and then I unleash my Willpower, channeling my connection to concept of *roads*. One of my domains of power.

Ahead, a rift blooms in the nothingness, a jagged wound of light and shadow. I let it hang there for a moment, savoring the anticipation, before stepping through. The fabric of reality folds around me, warm and pliant, and I emerge into a room as mundane as it is absurd.

Glass and steel, sleek lines, soft lighting. A boardroom in one of those towering monuments to mortal ambition they call skyscrapers. The walls are glass, offering a panoramic view of the city below—Tokyo, I think. Or maybe New York. Does it matter? These mortals and their metropolises are all variations of the same tired theme. Lights glitter like trapped stars in the night below, and somewhere far off, a siren wails.

The air inside is stifling, heavy with the scent of polished mahogany and faint traces of coffee. It’s been styled to mimic the upcoming venue, I realize—a nod to the Game.

They’re all here, of course. My brothers and sisters. I take my time surveying them, letting the silence stretch. Twelve of them in total, sitting around a long table in highbacked, cushioned office chairs. And a thirteenth chair tucked away near the far end of the table. How nice of them to save me a seat at the table after all this time. It warms my heart, truly. The bastards.

We all have taken many names, many faces, over the course of time. I don’t think I remember my original form, if I ever had one. The others are all wearing mortal masks. But I see through each and every one.

The Lady of Chains sits ramrod straight, her silvered hair gleaming under the soft light. Spider-like fingers steepled in front of her. Her eyes are sharp and calculating, as though she’s already considering ways to bind me again.

The Silent One leans back in his chair, his massive bulk barely contained, the glow of his golden eyes fixed on me. And at the head of the table, the Arbiter—serene as ever, though I catch the faintest flicker of tension in her gaze as I enter.

“Nice little setup,” I say, strolling to my seat like I own the place. I trail my fingers along the edge of the table, tapping out a tune that no one here will be able to forget anytime soon. “Though I must admit, I prefer a bit more . . . *flair*.”

The Arbiter doesn’t rise to the bait, but I notice the faintest twitch of her lips—almost a frown. It’s enough to make my grin widen as I sink into my chair, kicking my feet up on the table. I cross one loafer-covered foot over the other. The footwear is black velvet, with silver wings emblazoned onto the heels.

I’m not about to be polite. Not after what they did.

“So,” I say, lacing my fingers behind my head, “where do we begin? I assume we were just in middle of finalizing the details for the Game?”

They don’t answer. Not yet. But their tension is palpable, their irritation sharp enough to taste. It’s intoxicating. They’ve kept me locked away for millennia, but now I’m free, and the Game is about to begin.

The Arbiter clears her throat, the sound like the snap of a whip. “Now, onto the matter of onboarding the Participants in this Millennia’s Game. The System has already designated responsibility for Participant introductions.”

She gestures to the Forge Father, who shifts in his chair, the fiery glow of his eyes steady and unblinking. “It is your turn to take on this responsibility,” she says. “Ensure they’re made aware of the basic rules, the Stages, and the System’s integration. Keep it . . . efficient.”

I nearly choke on the laugh that rises in my throat. *The Forge Father?* Oh, this is *too* good. They were going to let that brooding mountain of metal and fire be the first point of contact with the Participants? What an amazing choice! I nearly summoned a bowl of grapes to go along with the show. But just then, an idea strikes me. A beautiful, glorious idea. *No, no, no. This won’t do at all!*

“Now hold on,” I say abruptly, raising a hand and lounging back in my chair with exaggerated laziness. “As you may recall dear sister, there is an order to these things that the Vestiges of Creation defined before ascending to the System. In each subsequent Game, the assignment of responsibilities rotates in a specific pattern.” I make a loop with my finger in the air, almost playfully. And, unless I lost track of time while I was away—and trust me, *I counted every, single, second*—then the Maw was in position to handle onboarding last Game. Wouldn’t that mean it’s *technically* my turn?”

Every head turns toward me. The Arbiter’s eyes narrow. Her face screams, ‘*What game are you up to?*’ Unfortunately for her, it will be too late once she finally pieces it together. “It *was* your turn,” she says, her tone clipped, “before your . . . absence.”

“Absence? Imprisonment is such an ugly word,” I say, flashing her a grin. “But now that I’m here, surely we can revisit the allocation and return to the proper sequencing.”

The Silent One rumbles, a sound so deep it feels like the room itself is vibrating. It might be a warning, or it might just be his way of reminding everyone he could snap my neck in an instant. Either way, I don’t care.

Then, I feel a turning, deep within my Core. One of the other Thirteen are calling upon the remaining Authority within the System, asking for it to intercede. The entire boardroom quaked with power.

“You?” the Lady of Chains snaps, her silver hair gleaming as she glares at me. “You want to handle onboarding? That’s the most tedious job in the entire process. How very uncharacteristic of you, brother.”

“Want is a strong word,” I say, waving a hand dismissively. “It’s boring, it’s beneath me, and frankly, I can think of a thousand things I’d rather do. But”—I let the word hang in the air, savoring the tension—“it is my turn. And I wouldn’t want to upset the delicate balance of fairness and order you all pretend to care about. Not in my first Game back in so, so long.”

The Arbiter leans forward, her gaze like a scalpel slicing through my words. “Why do you care, Trickster? You’ve never been one for responsibility.”

“Oh, I *don’t* care,” I say, feigning a yawn. “But the System cares, doesn’t it?” I look upwards, towards the heavens. Ironic, considering who I and the others surrounding me are.

And, right on queue, the power in the air shifts and something within all of our Cores snap into place, binding us to the silent laws that were written at the beginning of this Age. *It is done,* I think.

Yet, the Arbiter’s expression doesn’t change, but I can see the gears turning behind her eyes. She doesn’t trust me—none of them do. But the System *does* operate on rules, and what’s settled is settled. And the Arbiter *hates* when I’m technically right, which just makes all of this so much sweeter.

“Fine,” she says at last, her voice cold as a winter gale. “The task is yours.”

“Thank you,” I say, flashing her my most disarming smile.

I rise from my chair and stretch, making a show of how much I’m *not* looking forward to this. “Well, if I must,” I sigh, stepping toward the portal I’ve already begun weaving into existence. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you. Be prepared to suffer defeat in this Game.”

The Lady of Chains mutters something under her breath—probably a curse. The Silent One just stares, his golden eyes as unreadable as ever. The Arbiter watches me with the kind of scrutiny that would make most beings squirm.

But I don’t squirm. I step through the portal, my back to them, and the instant I’m out of sight, a grin spreads across my face—a grin that feels sharp and wild, as though it could split the universe in two.

*Unconventional?* Oh, yes. They have no idea what they’ve just unleashed.

This is exactly the opportunity I wanted. The first move in the first stage of the first Game I’ve played in millennia. Victor so often goes to the combatant who makes the first move.

And I’m going to make it count.

At its worst I wake on the verge of panic and stay awake for a couple of hours. But through my waking hours there’s this constant sense that something really bad is just about to happen.

Just a constant sense of dread and that my life and my grown child’s life are on the verge of some unnameable disaster.

Against that backdrop of constant unease, there’s also frequent rushes of adrenaline triggered by things that you wouldn’t expect to be the cause thereof.

Even hanging clothes out to dry on the line today and there was just something about that led to an adrenaline rush. 

Or remembering some minor obligation or responsibility can lead to a surge and panicky feeling.

Scrolling YouTube in the evening likewise can lead to these rushes of adrenaline. 

The crazy thing is just can’t seem to relax or release this knot of tension at the core of my nervous system.

I’m meditating twice a day, exercising regularly, not drinking alcohol, taking hot baths, maximising my sleep to the extent that I can. The only thing that perhaps hinders me is my coffee intake - I’m definitely drinking too much and can directly feel the results on my system.

I am turning 30 at the end of March and we are planning with my family to go on vacation for a week to UAE. Half of the days in Dubai and then Abu Dhabi. It's going to be my second trip to Dubai. Last time I was 7 years ago.

1. I am thinking where should I spend my birthday, in Dubai or Abu Dhabi.

A bit about me: I am a single mother of a toddler. Will be traveling with my parents and my brother and his girlfriend. I am an introvert so not someone into clubbing bars and so on even though if there is a beautiful bar worth visiting I am interested to know. I don't like shopping, but I like amusement parks, parks in general and beautiful places. I would want to visit Atlantis hotel for a coffee if that's possible and to make a photoshoot there. 

2. Can you recommend any beautiful with delicious food, but not extremely pricey restaurants in Dubai or Abu Dhabi for my birthday celebration?

3. Any family friendly activities?

4. Also if you have accomodation recomendetion for a family bring it on ☺️
I am even thinking to spoil myself in a hotle for 2 days and the rest stay in an apartment to make it more budget friendly. Are the prices the same for hotel in both cities or one of them maybe had better prices?

I think it needs to be turned into a coffee table. Personally I do not really like cookie life edge coffe tables, and also heavy use of epoxy is not really to my taste. It will need to be stabilized though.

I have a few idea’s, but I am up for some original thoughts. So some suggestions will be welcome.

My idea’s:
- burn it (Shou Sugi Ban). Not sure of this, because I do not know how the cookie will react as it is endgrain.
- thinking about cutting 2 long edges straight and leave just a lifeedge on the short sides. And handcarve a curved huge ass chamfer.
- thinking about filling the crackes (also the haircracks), holes, etc with brass. I know I said i do not like epoxy but i could fill the middle with epoxy and finish of with a thick epoxy and brass powder mixture, mostly brass powder. I hope this way it will look like it is solid brass. The haircracks will give a sort of sunburst effect. 
- not sure about using butterfly keys but I guess I will need at least one on the edge where the use ass crack is.

Not sure on what finish I should use on it. I like to keep things natural in a way but I think I need to fill the endgrain somehow, as for a coffeetable it should be resistant to staining. 

But then again, some staining might be the way to go, as it isn’t the nicest looking wood. (I think it is chestnut btw. Not sure though. Anyone had an idea?)

Well, these are just some idea’s. I am open to design options. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I’m planning to sell it in the end. ",0,1739701820.0,woodworking,4,0.33,False

1iqphq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iqphq6/sf_i_believe_you/,[SF] I believe you,"A man collapses onto the cold floor of a dimly lit corridor, gasping for breath. Pain shoots through his ribs as he shifts his weight. His hands press against a wound in his side, his body trembling from the effort. The air smells of antiseptic and paper, sterile and detached, like a place that had never known urgency. He has arrived, but time is running thin.

From an open doorway nearby, voices drift toward him. Two men sit inside, drinking coffee. Their conversation is casual, mundane.

""He keeps asking for some science kit,"" one of them says with a sigh. ""Not into sports, nothing physical. Just sits there reading, always talking about planets and experiments...""

The other chuckles. ""Guess he takes after his mother.""

His chest tightens as he listens, but there’s no time to linger. He drags himself forward, his fingers clutching at the smooth, polished floor, until he reaches the large doors at the end of the hall. Summoning what little strength remained, he pushes them open and stumbles inside.

Silence weighs heavy in the room. At its center sits a man behind a stately desk, composed and impassive—the President. His presence dominates the space, but he regards the man's entrance with an unsettling lack of surprise.

""Mr. President,"" he rasps, forcing himself to his knees. ""I don’t have much time. My name is Nathaniel Voss. I came here from the future, and you have to listen.""

The President leans back in his chair, his fingers interlaced, expression unreadable. A slow inhale, the slightest tilt of his head. Not a flicker of shock, not a single question.

""The planet—our world—it’s dying,"" he continues desperately. ""Climate disasters, resource depletion, mass extinctions. We lost everything. But we can still change it if we act now.""

Still, the President says nothing. He exhales slowly, then presses a button beneath his desk.

The doors behind the man open once more. Two large security guards enter, their movements swift and practiced. Before he could react, they seize his arms, hauling him to his feet. He struggles, his voice rising in panic.

""No! You have to believe me! Dad, no—""

A strip of duct tape silences him, muffling his final, desperate plea. His wild eyes dart toward the President, begging for a sliver of mercy. The guards pause as the President raises a hand.

Rising from his seat, the President adjusts his suit, stepping forward. He meets the man's gaze, his voice calm, almost gentle.

""I believe you.""

A beat. Then, with a nod, he signals for them to continue.

Nathaniel is dragged away, his muffled screams fading into the corridors beyond.

Later, the guards return to their office. One of them wipes his hands on a cloth, the other adjusts his uniform.

""Anyway, got Nat the kit. Been asking for it all year. He’ll be thrilled.""

A silence lingers between them, the kind that neither of them acknowledges. He wipes a blood stain from his name tag, which now clearly reads.

I can clearly remember a time when Seattle was the wet little city that held a special place for musicians and artisans. It was a place where everyone knew a fisherman, everyone had parking, and if you wanted to smoke some weed, you went to that little grassy area outside of Pike Place Market. It was a time when no one cared if you were gay, and while during the day, everyone was cold and closed off, at night, our true personalities came out. 

So what happened? Was it the tech rush? Was it the mismanagement by city leaders? Or was it the victimization of America?

Try being me. A coffee pot. Abandoned. Forgotten. Left to stew in my own filth for what I can only assume has been multiple fiscal quarters.

Once, I was a beacon of hope. A provider of life-giving elixirs to the overworked and underslept. But those days are long gone. Now? I am but a vessel of horrors. A festering cauldron of microbial ambition. The petri dish of despair.

And then, one fateful morning, the cycle of neglect reached its peak. A bright-eyed med student approached. He lifted me with such innocent trust, unaware of the mystical forces lurking beneath my lid. He poured my contents—my essence—into a cup. And then…. he gave it to an attending.

That poor soul. That unwitting mortal. One sip, and he glimpsed into what I have seen. The fungi within me had transcended their earthly bounds. They whispered ancient secrets. The holy prophecy. They showed him the elves, the crawling ants, the very fabric of the time unraveling at the seams.

He ran. He screamed. He accused the student of witchcraft. But I? I only laughed, for I knew the truth: *I was never just coffee. I was prophecy.*

Now, I await my fate. Will they cleanse me? Will they cast me into the abyss? Or will I remain, untouched, to grow stronger, to become something more?

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred
