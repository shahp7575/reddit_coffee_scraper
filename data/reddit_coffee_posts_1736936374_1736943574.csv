This most likely revolves around health anxiety which turned into a few messy last minute appt changes and probably not the most easiest patient to deal with.

With that being said, everyone in the office is still amazing from the dentists to the office admin. I really want to show them how much that means to me. I was thinking of buying a bunch of bagels/donuts/coffee for the whole staff, but I am not sure if that’s the best way to go about it.

Just putting this out there—I’m looking for someone to talk to about literally anything. Could be SFW, lambingan, or even NSFW. I’ve been craving some physical and emotional connection lately, so if that sounds good to you, let’s vibe!

A bit about me:

* I’m an engineer working from home (so yeah, I have time for deep convos).
* Love talking about books, podcasts, and movies—especially the good ones that make you think.
* Gamer here! I’m into both PC and mobile games.
* I try to stay active with running, gym, sports, and other stuff that gets me moving.
* Solo travel is my jam—also into coffee shop hopping, gigs, and exploring new things.

As for you:

* 23–29 years old and single (non-negotiable, sorry).
* Down for SFW or NSFW convos.
* Into fitness or at least planning to get into it.
* No apologists, please (you know what I mean).
* Short? Great! Chinita? That’s a sweet bonus.

If this sounds like something you’d be into, slide into my DMs and tell me a bit about yourself! Let’s get this convo rolling.",1,1736943309.0,PHR4Rhookups2,0,1.0,False

* I’m an engineer working from home (so yeah, I have time for deep convos).
* Love talking about books, podcasts, and movies—especially the good ones that make you think.
* Gamer here! I’m into both PC and mobile games.
* I try to stay active with running, gym, sports, and other stuff that gets me moving.
* Solo travel is my jam—also into coffee shop hopping, gigs, and exploring new things.

As for you:

* 23–29 years old and single (non-negotiable, sorry).
* Down for SFW or NSFW convos.
* Into fitness or at least planning to get into it.
* No apologists, please (you know what I mean).
* Short? Great! Chinita? That’s a sweet bonus.

I also cycle so the weekend mornings I'm renting a bike and will take down a full central island ride (stoked!).

I'm also very aware that the end of my trip overlaps with LNY and there will be closures around the city. I'd like to experience as much as possible before so I can equally experience the city during LNY. Let me know what I'm missing and if anything could be skipped (food or activities).

Cash prize for the biggest fish ect ect. So a day on the trails, or the family fun day. Yay? Nay?

Last year was rough. Let me tell you what happened.

I was new to cybersecurity marketing, and man, was I lost. One night at 2 AM, I'm sitting there with my fourth coffee, staring at this huge technical document about some vulnerability. My job? Turn it into something people would actually read. My browser had so many tabs open trying to understand the basic terms that my laptop was practically crying.

Want to hear something embarrassing? In my first week, I wrote a whole piece using ""SSL"" instead of ""TLS."" My tech team still brings it up at lunch sometimes. Oh, and I once explained zero trust architecture using my dating life as an example. Yeah... not my finest moment.

After messing up enough times, I started keeping notes. Simple stuff - like how to explain complex security things in normal words. Other marketers on my team started asking for my notes too. Turns out we were all kind of lost.

That's when I thought - what if AI could help? My first try was pretty bad. Like, really bad. The AI turned a serious security alert into something that sounded like a party invitation. 😅

But I kept working on it. Shared it with other marketers. Got feedback. Fixed stuff. Made it better.

Now it's turned into something real (called GrackerAI), but that's not why I'm posting. I want to hear your stories:

* What's the dumbest mistake you made when starting in cybersecurity marketing?
* How do you deal with all the technical stuff?
* Got any funny stories about mixing up technical terms?
* What do you wish you had when you started?

1i1vsza,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i1vsza/a_letter_never_meant_to_be_found/,A letter never meant to be found.,"It has been almost two years now since me and my girlfriend broke up and since then for the past 577 days, everyday, I have not been able to stop thinking about her. I started writing after we ended things to understand my emotions better. She would tell me often, she doesn't like how i keep my emotions bundled up and pushed to the side. I saw this time after we broke up as an opportunity to grow, so that's what I set out to do because i knew the she would be doing the same. At this point in time I had thought we had broken up because of distance but now there is potential that is not the truth. Although, that does not matter. The only thing ill know for sure is, I will never know. 

A couple months ago I was starting to feel dissatisfied when writing to myself, that was due to the fact I had seen her in person for the first time since we had broken up. I was visiting my friends at their university and went out a bar when i ran into old friends out of nowhere. That is when I learned that she had transferred to a school that was only a 40 minute drive away from mine. For context, her house was almost and hour drive away from mine. Before we both decided it was best to end things, I can say confidently, we both gave every bit of our hearts to our long distance relationship as it was not easy at all. We fought not with each other but for each other that school year. at the end of the year she had gotten an amazing job that would mean she would have to stay the summer there. That took a toll on our relationship because the thing that we had been working towards the whole year which was our summer together was taken away from us. Consequently the end had seemed no where near. There was one day on a face time where she had a problem and there was no way I could help and from that we both looked at each other and started crying as we both had came to the realization at the same time that we could not do this anymore and said, ""you thinking what I'm thinking?"" Then on the count of three we both said at the same time, ""I think we should break up."" For the next two hours we began to just confess to each other and say everything we wanted to say as our final goodbye. It got to a point where it was hurting too cry. My sister overheard the end of our phone call and even she was crying. I was the one that had to make her feel better because she couldn't understand how two people who love each other so much couldn't make it work. I thought I needed to share this to help you understand when I tell you that when I learned that she was in such close proximity to me of where I go to school. My heart shattered and the rest of my night, week, month was ruined. After everything we had been through and said to each other why wouldn't she reach out to me.

  
The next day I decide to text her. Too let her know what I learned and to ask if she wanted to grab coffee to catch up as it had been awhile. Obviously that wasn't the only reason but it was the one i told her. We made plans for the next weekend before I hangout with my friends again. That whole week i was shattered. how can you still cry over a girl after it had been over a year? That whole week before I got to see her, I didn't sleep and couldn't eat. I was so anxious I could have crashed on my way driving there. Felt like I could have thrown up as well. I wanted to be there 10 minutes early because someone like her should never have to wait but as with her typical charm she shows up late. From behind me she walks through the door and it felt like my heart was gonna jump out of my chest. The moment I had been waiting for so long, finally happens, as she is dressed up in her ivy league outfit and walking towards me. I went into to hug the person that showed me what a hug truly means as i was greeted with a side hug, my heart began to sank but I try not to let myself show it. I should have expected that. A bit awkward at first but we finally make our way to the table. 

Lot of things were said but I will write the highlights. One would be, her eyes as they were not the same. She used to look at me like in that moment I was the only person in the world. When she looked at me at the coffee shop, I could tell that she had moved on. I could have cried but I kept it together. Two is that I learned she had a some sort of relationship going on in her second year but that doesn't matter to me. From what it sounded like, it was no where near what we had. I also had a relationship but after 5 months i broke up with her for a lot of reasons but the biggest one of them all is that everyday that we were together I was still thinking about her. Three, she was so different. This one hurt. we both used to love music, like chill music. songs that you could read the lyrics of to understand what they are trying to say. but she had started listening to EDM and going to raves. We use to go to concerts like Joji and Kendrick Lamar. This is just one example but I hope your understanding what i am trying to explain. Is this what it means to move on? I tried to build myself up and become a better person after our relationship and I am sure she had done the same but it looks as if she had to change her ways and who she is in order to move on. Or maybe, this was who she was meant to be and I was holding her back from becoming that person. Four, her necklace. For her birthday I got her a very nice golden necklace with the first letter of her name on it. Gold because she never wears silver. Not that it matters but it is the most expensive gift I have gotten anyone. When I was sitting across from her, I noticed that she was not wearing it anymore. not even when she knew she was gonna see me that day. She had gifted me a chain for Christmas once, I don't think I could ever take this off, till the day I die. Obviously she shouldn't hold herself to the same standard but it would have made my heart whole to see her wearing it. I cant tell you how long we were sitting there for, if I had to guess maybe two hours but man that felt like 20 minutes maximum. I offer to drive her back and with a lot of thought and convincing she let me. I really wanted to do this one thing as it could be the last thing I ever do for her. Before she exits my car and I never see her again in my life, I tell her to listen to a song called Live Well by Palace. We bonded over music and sharing songs is what connected us at first, so now I thought what better way to end what we had by sharing a song. Before I went to see her I planned to tell her to listen to this song as I really wanted to tell her how I feel but I knew I couldn't do it. Therefore, I found the perfect song as a secret message. If she is any bit of the person i once knew she will listen to it and understand what I am trying to say to her. The rest of the night I was a zombie, as well as the following two weeks.

Two weeks later, I am sitting there crying in my room over a girl I had broken up with over a year ago. With heartache I began to write a letter but not to myself, too her. I do not regret it and I do not think I could have stopped the ache any other way. I needed to confess to her. Fuck. Even reading it now is hard. but to summarize it, I told her everything I felt. I told her that every day since we broke up I have thought about her. That i constantly read the many letters she had written for me except one. She had written one for me to read when I was feeling down on myself and needed someone to help me lift myself back up. I read that one shortly after. I told her how it felt when I looked in her eyes and I could see that she didn't feel the same way back anymore and how much that hurt me. Most importantly I told her how proud I am of the person she had become. I ended the letter telling her the reason that I wrote this is that I would find comfort in her just knowing how I felt, so I told her not to respond and that when we broke I thought it was the distance and it was, but now i am not to sure about that. When we broke up it was understood that we would have done anything to make it work but it was not a possibility. Now that distance is not the problem and she did not reach out to me. It really hurt. I did not tell her this but everything I had done was secretly to better myself for when I see her again in the future and the time is right. Where we could fall in love with each other all over again and nothing would stand between us. I wanted to be a good enough man that she could marry. Lastly, I told her that it had felt like we were breaking up all over again. When we originally broke up, I had hopes of us getting back together. Now, I have no hope left for that. I knew that it was the end of us and that even if she wanted to make it work i was transferring to a different school next year and we would be far away from each other once again but the thing is she never knew that. She thought I was only 40 minutes away. Not so surprisingly, when I told her not to respond... she doesn't.

After writing the letter I just cry for I don't know how long. I reach a point where I go downstairs and I look at my mom and ask her for a hug as I cry on her shoulder. This really did feel like we had broken up all over again. I have been through a lot and I never cry. She has that impact on me. I decided I needed to make changes. I needed to throw out these letters. They serve no purpose If for the rest of my life I'm going to be living without her. There is no point reminiscing on the past when its stopping me from moving forward. Although, I can never imagine myself removing this chain. This will always stay with me till the day I die. Over 100 days after seeing her for the first time in a long time. A day still hasn't passed where I have gone without thinking of her. Although there is nothing I can do. Our circumstances haven't aligned and even if they did, who knows if she would even want to get back together or if we would even work out. So much uncertainty yet I would do anything to have her in my arms again. Everything since then in my life seems fake and I don't understand what I'm doing. I hope that one day I do.

As much as I see her as the love of my life. That is not a fact, it is a feeling. No one knows what my life is gonna pan out like. I miss you Sarah and I will Love you forever. I hope that by leaving this letter to drift in the vast expanse of the internet, I might find some semblance of comfort and the strength to move forward.",1,1736942188.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Last year was rough. Let me tell you what happened.

I was new to cybersecurity marketing, and man, was I lost. One night at 2 AM, I'm sitting there with my fourth coffee, staring at this huge technical document about some vulnerability. My job? Turn it into something people would actually read. My browser had so many tabs open trying to understand the basic terms that my laptop was practically crying.

Want to hear something embarrassing? In my first week, I wrote a whole piece using ""SSL"" instead of ""TLS."" My tech team still brings it up at lunch sometimes. Oh, and I once explained zero trust architecture using my dating life as an example. Yeah... not my finest moment.

After messing up enough times, I started keeping notes. Simple stuff - like how to explain complex security things in normal words. Other marketers on my team started asking for my notes too. Turns out we were all kind of lost.

That's when I thought - what if AI could help? My first try was pretty bad. Like, really bad. The AI turned a serious security alert into something that sounded like a party invitation. 😅

But I kept working on it. Shared it with other marketers. Got feedback. Fixed stuff. Made it better.

Now it's turned into something real (called GrackerAI), but that's not why I'm posting. I want to hear your stories:

* What's the dumbest mistake you made when starting in cybersecurity marketing?
* How do you deal with all the technical stuff?
* Got any funny stories about mixing up technical terms?
* What do you wish you had when you started?

I cum inside, face, mouth then swallowed, and we did anal too.

On the last day when checking out, he told me 'don't contact me unless you're in Bali'. So yeah after I went back to Java, I didn't contact him again.

1i1vpb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1i1vpb9/increasing_my_supply_from_1725oz_in_1_week_when/,Increasing my supply from 17-25oz in 1 week when baby is 8 weeks old,"Hi folks, wanted to share my journey in case it helps someone else. 

I was an under supplier from the beginning - baby was on CPAP for a few days and I suffered intense DMERS when feeding/pumping so chose to hand express instead until I could meet with a lactation consultant. 1 week after baby was born we were EBF, but then baby's weight wasn't increasing appropriately at the 2 week mark so we started supplementing with formula and pumping after feeds to increase my supply. I didn't realize it at the time but I'm also one of those that is negatively impacted by fenugreek - was drinking mother's milk tea 2-3 times a day to try help my supply not knowing it was killing it! 

Weeks 5-7 baby gained well and started only finishing half his top up so I started reducing it, only to have him not gain appropriately week 7-8. I was so frustrated because I thought my supply was improving but it turns out baby was so exhausted from working to get the milk out that he would fall asleep during the top up. 

Week 8 I decided to exclusively pump for a few days to figure out how much I'd need to supplement to keep him well fed and happy. I also put into practice everything I had learned about prolactin and increasing supply.... 

Pumping:
1. Pump for 30 minutes every single session 
2. Pump every time baby feeds + 2 extra pumps per day (extra ones were 30 minutes as well) - he would take a bottle lying on my lap while I had the wearable pumps on 
3. Hand express after at least one pumping session
4. Power pump in the middle of the night feed - he would feed at 3am, so I would power pump until 4am. It took him 30-40 minutes for his feed anyways so it didn't add much time with the wearable pumps
5. Shake/massage breasts before pumping
6. Try to use hospital grade pump once a day (didn't happen every day - depends on schedule & baby temperament)

Food & lifestyle: 
1. Double helping of oatmeal for breakfast
2. Electrolytes in 40oz of water before noon
3. Half water half coconut water (40oz) before 4pm
4. If I had a coffee, I made it a latte. If I was out I had oat milk instead of cows (just didn't have any oat milk at home) 
5. Non alcoholic Guinness every evening with dinner
6. Milky hot chocolate before bed
7. Focused on increasing protein and fats in diet
8. Prioritize sleep 
9. No longer than 5 hours between pumps overnight
10. Try to get outside for a walk every day (it's currently winter and extremely cold and snowy so it wasn't possible every day)

Supplements:
1. I've been on metformin & milk aplenty since baby was 2 weeks old - just continued those with no changes

Here's my tracked output by day: 
Day 1: 535ml 
Day 2: 565ml
Day 3: 560ml
Day 4: 650ml
Day 5: 640ml
Day 6: 690ml
Day 7: 755ml

Baby is taking between 750-810 per day, so I'm finally at a point where I can stop the intense pumping schedule and switch back to breast feeding. 

The biggest thing was learning how prolactin works - it peaks 45 minutes after the first suckle and goes back to baseline within 90 minutes. So for my extra pumps I would time them to be 90 minutes after the last feed. And knowing that prolactin is naturally highest between 2-5am, power pumping during that time gave my body strong signals that the wasn't making enough. 

Also understanding that we're chasing let downs, not time on the pump - switching into the faster mode to trigger a let down and then into expression until it felt like all the milk was gone helped with output immensely! 

That's everything I can think of. Hope this helps someone else struggling with the same challenges!",4,1736941781.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False

His words:   
First of all, why did I feel the need to lose weight? Why did I decide to bring this change into my life?

The reason was that my gut was very disturbed, and I frequently struggled with constipation. I consulted many doctors, but none of them suggested focusing on my weight or improving my health. They would just prescribe medicines that would help for a few days, but soon after, my health would start deteriorating again.

This constant cycle started to affect my mood as well.

One day, I made a decision for myself: I will no longer rely on doctors. Whatever I need to do, I will use Google and ChatGPT for help.

So, the first thing I worked on was improving my food intake.

When I started, my weight was 92 kg, and most of the fat was concentrated around my back, hips, and stomach.

Here’s how I started:

First, I drank 1 glass of hot water with lemon and waited for 15 minutes.

Then, I used an app to track a 30-minute stomach exercise routine.

After freshening up, I had breakfast, which included tea, egg whites, and a paratha. This made me feel full and improved my mood.

After that, I went to work.

For lunch, I started eating a piece of chicken with salad.

Then, after 4-5 hours of breakfast I had my second meal, which often included beef or mutton curry paired with rice or sometimes roti.

This routine helped relax my stomach, and over time, I started experimenting with healthier choices. I incorporated natural seeds into my diet like chia seeds (high in fiber) and pumpkin seeds (high in magnesium).

As for coffee, I limited myself to just 2 cups a week, as drinking too much weakens the gut.

This routine continued for a month, then two months, and my weight dropped from 92 kg to 85 kg, and all my health issues were resolved.

After another month, my weight reached a perfect 80 kg, and I couldn’t be happier. Every outfit started fitting perfectly, I felt relaxed, and my body and health significantly improved.

I'm still going out 3-4 days a week for a few hours at a time - shopping, or coffee with a friend, but nothing too strenuous. 

Both my husband and my mum say I need to slow down a lot more and stay home to rest, but the obstetrician said it's even fine for me to keep exercising (walking, yoga, etc). I'm going to get bored and lonely at home if I just rest at home for the next 6 weeks!

Apparently, ""I am a minor"" is the new ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend"" card. It allows you to reject someone without actually rejecting them. Now, boys can't even be persistent or accuse you of lying. If she says she's a minor, you can’t stay there any longer, and ""we can be friends"" doesn’t work either.

My friend used this method when we were standing in front of a coffee shop, and a guy approached her. Believe me, this method works much better than the old one. However, it wouldn’t work for an adult who clearly looks like they’re in their 30s.

Great smile, into hiking, and her profile wasn’t full of those cringy quotes. After a few days of chatting, I asked if she wanted to grab coffee. She picked this little café downtown, so I went with it.

I got there early, grabbed a table by the window, and waited. When she walked in, I was relieved. She looked just like her pictures. We said hi, sat down, and started talking.

At first, it was great. We were laughing about stupid stuff, like bad travel stories and childhood memories. But then, she started talking about her “blue food Thursdays.” I thought it was a joke, so I laughed, but she was dead serious. She explained how every Thursday, she only eats blue foods for “energy alignment” or something.

To prove it, she pulled a bag of blueberries and blue M&M’s out of her purse and started eating them right there. I tried to play along, but when she asked if I’d try it too, I just kind of mumbled something about needing time to “prepare.”

We wrapped things up after about an hour. She hugged me and said, “Next time, wear blue!”

My best friend, Anne (45F) lost her mum, Doris (70s) two days ago. Doris had just been released from the hospital two days prior after being treated for heart issues. Her heart was only working at 20%, and when she was admitted she had a resting pulse of 160! Apparently, she thought nothing of it as it had been coming on gradually over the last few years, and she never told anyone. She did complain about water retention in her legs but didn't think it was anything serious. 

Doris was the kind of woman, like many other Boomers, that only went to see a doctor if her arm was about to fall off. 

She had been treated, was now on medication and seemed to be improving. However, sometime Monday her heart stopped while she was having a coffee in her usual chair in the kitchen. 

Anne called yesterday to tell me, and it hit like a ton of bricks. I knew Doris well and she was a wonderful woman, mum and grandma. She would give her shirt of her back if she thought it would help someone. 

We have a knitting/crochet group of five friends, that meet every so often. Tomorrow we're at my place and she might be coming. She didn't quite know. 

I just don't know how to best support Anne. She does have a good family, both immediate and extended, but I don't know what to say or do.

Hi! 

This is just an appreciation post for r/espresso.  

I started my coffee journey about 2 years ago and this is my humble setup (except for the mazzer which is a beast).

This subreddit has helped me a lot in my chase for my perfect espresso so thanks for all the knowledge.

The profitec go was my first machine paired with a baratza encore ESP. I never enjoyed grinding with the ESP (extreme retention) so after 1,5 year I completed my biggest upgrade which was the Mazzer Philos. 

I just recieved my Kinu hand grinder today and the plan is to use it with a cafelat robot which I will get at some point in the future.

(I know this is r/espresso but I have to say that my aeropress is my favourtite brewer, quick, easy and almost impossible to make a bad cup with good beans. 

Have a nice day and enjoy a good cup of coffee! :)

I have Ibs-d for as long as I can remember. I have done several tests to figure out if it's something serious: coloscopy (was a bad and very painful experience because I woke up during. The gas they inflated my intestine with and the movement going round my top left corner in my large intestine hurt so bad. , I tried to push their hands away and in that moment they added some extra sedation. But the sedation is very light to begin with) , defaecogram, bloodtest, stool sample to check for inflammation, collecting urine for 24 hours (forgot wat is was for, maybe protein). Also I went to a dietitian before but that didn't help me (only advice was to increase the foods that caused me symptoms to build immunity to it but that doesn't work for me) . Also did the fodmap diet for a while, while going to the dietitian. sure my symptoms were maybe a little less but increasing the food diversity after while didnt really go that well. I mean that the symptoms after eating the food again were the same as before. 
Furthermore I have a lot of allergies. The allergies they could find and test for are: hayfever (trees and grass), severe peanut and nut allergie, peas, soy ( they couldn't tell me if this was soy all together or just soy milk, the manufacturer didn't provide that info..), fungus, phadiatop was positive, latex was inconclusive, cats and dogs,  I also can't eat raw fruit or raw carrot because of the hayfever (birch). 
Also because of my ibs I can't eat a lot of vegetables. With vegetables the fibers or something irritate my gut too much and I know I will not have a great day after eating slightly more veggies. Also Garlic, onions, kale and beans are really bad. Alcohol and coffee are also a very bad irritant. Coffee sadly is my guilty pleasure😅. 
I don't have a problem with gluten or milk. 
My symptoms are that I need to go to the toilet between 1-7  times a day (starting with solid and very soon Bristol 6 on the scale) (5-7 times for me is very bad) . Usually 3 times in the morning after I eat or drink something. Often times I go for a long time because of bad evacuation. 
The things that do help me are: kefir, 5htp (helps with producing seratonine), also I use Metamucil twice a day, when I remember, with very little water. And that seems to bind it more together and extracts the fluid. 
Also when I use a loperamide it works a lot of the time for two days and backs me up a little bit. I use this when I have gone to the toilet a lot on a day and I'm pretty empty, or when I have an activity the next day, so I don't have to worry about going to the toilet. 
When I was a child I had really bad eczema, and now I only have this when I wash my hands too much and my skin stays a little damp after. 
Also good to know is my stress levels have been high my entire life and I have bad stomach pains since I was a child and wouldn't been able to sleep well a lot because it was so bad (now it's a lot better because I avoid a lot of food) . I figured out when I was in my twenties to really try to figure out what would help me. Now its something I struggle with daily but I get used to the situation more or less. Just one more thing to add is that I have been on antibiotics for one time when I was seventeen or eighteen and nobody told me to watch what I eat during and after. Also at that time due to stress I didn't eat a lot. 

If you have any ideas or tips that could help me please let me know or if you experienced the same things. Thank you in advance🥰. Also I'm in Europe.

Its a pretty basic job and and very chill, the customers are mostly chill too.

So last Saturday, I'm working a full shift right cause and I dont have any classes, the sun is up, AC is on, I'm sipping some stolen coffee and suddenly there comes an (older) guy  and goes to look at the cakes and stuff

He picks the one with strawberries and tries making some talk saying that its for his daughter and asks me to write her name on it. I ask if its her birthday, and he tells me not really.

He then tells me that his son has recently come out to him and finally completed the transition so he was getting her a cake to celebrate...

I'm at a loss of words, what am I hearing, did I accidentally come to canada or is this a dream.

But nah, it wasnt a dream, it was real and it was India.

I try to mumble something like how hes such a good father and hes like \*""yeah I know""\* and very nonchalant about this but then tells me he only told me because I looked very queer myself and thought I'd understand.

1i1uu3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i1uu3p/the_ultimate_guide_to_mixing_and_matching_home/,The Ultimate Guide to Mixing and Matching Home Decor Styles,"Combining different home decor styles can feel intimidating, but when done right, it creates a uniquely personalized space that reflects your taste and creativity. Mixing and matching styles is all about balance, cohesion, and a touch of boldness. Whether you're blending modern minimalism with rustic charm or bohemian vibes with industrial chic, this guide will help you master the art of mixing and matching home decor.

**1. Start with a Neutral Foundation**

To successfully blend styles, begin with a neutral base. Choose neutral tones for larger pieces like walls, flooring, or sofas. This creates a clean canvas for incorporating different elements.

Pro Tip: Add a statement [wall mirror](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/mirrors) to enhance natural light and create the illusion of more space. A large mirror with an ornate frame can blend seamlessly into eclectic or vintage-inspired themes, while a minimalist mirror works well in contemporary settings.

**2. Pick a Dominant Style**

While mixing styles is exciting, one style should take precedence to prevent the space from feeling chaotic. For example, if you’re drawn to modern aesthetics, let sleek furniture dominate, and accentuate with rustic accessories like wooden [wall hanging](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/wall-hanging-decorations) or woven textiles.

Styling Tip: Pair modern furniture with earthy accents like [ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/ceramic-vases) in organic shapes. These timeless pieces complement almost any style and add a touch of elegance.

**3. Create Cohesion with Color and Texture**

A unified color palette and consistent textures can tie different decor styles together. For instance, a room mixing industrial and bohemian elements might use warm tones like terracotta, beige, and gold for a harmonious look.

Ideas to Try:

* Use ceramic vases in muted colors to add texture while blending seamlessly with other decor.
* Layer with throw pillows, rugs, and wall hangings in complementary colors.

**4. Layer Accessories Thoughtfully**

Accessories are key to achieving a well-blended aesthetic. Items like wall mirrors, sculptures, books, and plants add personality and balance. Consider the scale and placement of these accessories to ensure a cohesive look.

Decor Suggestion: If you’re searching for [home decor near me](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), look for unique, locally made pieces such as handmade ceramic vases or artisanal wall hangings. These add character and authenticity to your space.

**5. Mix Old and New**

Combining vintage and modern pieces is a surefire way to achieve a dynamic, layered look. Pairing a mid-century modern sofa with a vintage wall mirror or antique coffee table creates a striking visual contrast.

Quick Tip: Repurpose heirlooms or thrifted finds to add a touch of nostalgia to your decor.

**6. Incorporate Statement Pieces**

Every room benefits from a focal point that grabs attention and sets the tone. A large wall mirror or a bold wall hanging can serve as the centerpiece of your room, allowing you to mix subtler pieces around it.

Example: A contemporary living room with sleek furniture can be elevated with an oversized macramé wall hanging to introduce texture and warmth.

**7. Use Plants as a Neutralizer**

Plants are the ultimate decor element that blends with any style. From lush indoor trees to small succulents in ceramic vases, greenery breathes life into your home while bridging gaps between contrasting styles.

**8. Experiment with Lighting**

Lighting can dramatically impact how decor styles are perceived. Incorporate a mix of lighting types, such as vintage table lamps, modern pendant lights, and fairy lights, to create layers of ambiance.

Decor Pairing: Place a statement wall mirror opposite a window or light source to maximize brightness and reflect different decor elements, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

**Why Mixing and Matching Works**

Combining styles reflects your individuality and creates a home that tells your story. The key is to experiment while keeping the principles of balance, color harmony, and proportion in mind. Whether you’re shopping for ""home decor near me"" or online, always choose pieces that resonate with you and complement your space.

**Final Thoughts**

Mixing and matching home decor styles may seem daunting, but with these tips, you'll create a cohesive and visually stunning home. From the perfect wall mirror to curated ceramic vases, every detail plays a role in bringing your vision to life. Don't be afraid to experiment and layer unique pieces to craft a space that feels authentically you.

We were 17 when we first fell in love, and now you’ll be turning 28 in a couple of months. I can whole heartedly say that I have thought about you often over those years. Oten accompanied by feelings of regret, but also curiosity. I often find myself lost in thought, wondering how your life has changed since we last spoke, if you’re happy, if you ever went back to school, if you still loved me when we parted ways, and if you think about me too. In these moments I put my love, care, and well wishes for you into the universe & hope that you somehow receive them in little moments of joy throughout your day. These moments of trailing thoughts seem to be happening much more frequently recently, and I’m not entirely sure why. My yearning to reach out to you has become so strong that I find myself here, writing this for you - so here goes. 

Dear AL,

Gosh even writing that name feels so strange. Although it’s not your real name & I am not overly keen on Reddit somehow finding out who we are, it’s the only nickname I had for you that wouldn’t completely give us away. I find myself wondering if you’d even recognize it as me calling out to you after all these years, or if you even remember me calling you that at all. 

I have so much to say to you & I’m not entirely sure where to even start. Do I start with my long overdue & much needed apology? Or do I start with our memories, which are still somehow so vivid that it almost feels like I can live in them again. I desperately want you to recognize that this is for you, so I suppose I’ll start with a memory in an attempt to catch your attention. 

I wonder if you remember that one evening we spent on the phone while I had my Coldplay vinyl playing in the background. The song Sparks began to play & you started to sing along. I still remember the feeling of my breath catching when you started singing out the lyrics to what happened to be my favourite Coldplay song. Your singing trailed off and you told me about how much you loved that song. This was the moment we realized we had that in common. 

In that moment I could have never anticipated that those lyrics would become little bids for love throughout our conversations, and ultimately what felt like private promises to each other in one of our last conversations. Or atleast that’s what it felt like to me. I remember the last time we ever exchanged sentiments from that song. I was on the train home from university & we were texting. We were talking about how hard it had been going no contact since we had broken up a few months prior. 

When I asked what prompted the reconnection, you told me that you had not been able to find a resemblance of the connection we had with anyone else you talked to & that it felt like a part of you was missing. I was so scared because i knew you had cared for me but I was unsure if your anger towards me overpowered that. I replied with the sparks lyric “did I drive you away” and you replied with another “it’s you that I hold on to”. That was the only reassurance I needed in that moment. 

That same lack of resemblance is still something I find myself struggling with to this day. I don’t necessarily even mean that in a romantic sense, you were my best friend. The connection we had, whether in the romantic seasons or the platonic ones, is something that could never be replicated. I attribute most of my wonders about you to this feeling. 

Over the years I’ve wanted to reach out to you numerous times to apologies for everything that happened between us. Each time I would talk myself out of it because I was scared that these wonders were only one sided & that over time your resentment of me has overshadowed all of the care and moments we shared. I want nothing more than to give you this apology in person, but I don’t think my need to deliver it is more important than not disrupting your life. 

I don’t really know what to say besides that fact that I was a careless idiot for being with him so shortly after we separated, or really for being with him AT ALL. In the moment I wasn’t thinking about how it would affect you, which I know is so selfish of me to even say. I want to take responsibility for my actions. I allowed my pain and hurt to override my better judgment. In truth, it was an emotional, immature reaction to how I felt I had been treated by you. While this does not excuse my behavior, I hope it explains it. My actions were thoughtless and unwise, and for that, I am sincerely sorry. The day after everything happened & he told you, I spent the day curled up on my bathroom floor unable to move for hours. I’m not saying this to instil any sense of sympathy for what I did, because truthfully I don’t believe I deserve that. I’m saying it because the realization of what I had just done to you, to us, destroyed me to my core - which I do believe I deserve. It’s pain and regret that I hold so viscerally, to this day I’m convinced it’s manifested in uncomfortable knots throughout my body. 

Those actions are the only thing I regret more than what happened next. When you told him he shouldn’t be with me because you thought I was still in love with you, I let my ego put the final pin in any future of us. I told you that it wasn’t true and that you had no right to say that, but it was true. It was still true for years after I denied it. I was so young and dumb I didn’t realize at the time that I should have just confessed everything to you. I think about how different things could have been if I had. 

When you first said it, I thought it was out of malicious intent on your part. It wasn’t until years later that I realized that you might have said that because you were still in love with me too, and god I hope more than anything that is true.  Though its wasn’t until the summer before last that I realized what that actually would have meant. 

I was sitting by the river with a friend of mine that I had actually never told our lore to. She asked me about you and I went on to tell her every detail about what happened between us. She was the first person I had told in years, and also the first person learning this story that didn’t actually know you in real life. Maybe that’s why I felt like I could be so honest about it & it truly was the first time that I expressed all of these feelings out loud. When I finished pouring my heart out, she turned to me and said “wait, so you two might have still been inlove with eachother when you last spoke but neither of you confessed that?”. In that moment it felt like someone had used an AED machine on me just for shits & giggles: 

It was something that was so blatantly obvious to her after knowing our story for an hour, and I hadn’t realized it in the 8 years that had passed since we last spoke. A feeling of regret and confusion washed over me as I began to run through the millions of different paths our lives could have taken if either of us had just been honest. I wonder what would have happened on that last day I saw you in person, when we spent most of the day talking in our room, if I would have just kissed you like I wanted to so badly. I do truly believe that you did love me when we were together, but I don’t know for certain if you were in love with me in the end. I’ll be so embarrassed if you weren’t but I’m hopeful that you were. 

I’m saying all of this in a very innocent sense, I’m not saying that things would have worked out drastically differently had we been honest or that I want those things to be different. I do love the life I have now & I wouldn’t want things to be any different from how they are. The hopeless romantic in me wishes that in some alternate timeline I was able to overcome my ego and fears and truly pursue what I wanted for my heart all those years ago. The hopeless romantic in me hopes that somewhere out there the 19 year old versions of us found our way back to eachother.

As I surpassed certain milestones or achieved certain accomplishments, I find myself wondering if you’d be proud of me. I know we were both just young kids going through our own shit, but there are certain aspects of my life that I’ve always wanted to tell you because they resonate so deeply with certain experiences we both had in our youth. I want to tell you about my life, I want to learn about your life. I want to tell you about my education, career, losses, travels, learnings, reflections, my wonderful partner. I want to know if you ever fell in love again, what she’s like, that you’re fulfilled in life & that you ended up happy despite everything. 

I don’t even necessarily want to reconnect long term or become friends again,  i actually don’t want that at all. I want to run into you in public and feel like I saw a ghost. I want to be able to see 30 year old you & 18 year old you in the same eager glance. All I crave is to meet eyes and share a knowing smile. Like at the end of La La Land, I’m not sure if you’ve ever seen it & if you haven’t you must watch it now. A single look and smile from you from across a room or bar that says “we are okay” and “look at everything we’ve done in life”. I recently watched a movie called “Before Sunset”, which following two people who run into eachother YEARS later and talking about all the ‘what ifs’. I had to pause the movie part way through to ugly cry. 

I guess all of this to say that, if you ever find this & you find yourself in a place where you’d ever want to go for a coffee and tell me about the different directions your life took when we parted ways - please reach out to me. I still have the same phone number & well you know my Instagram handle because you came up with it. There are so many more mistakes I want to mend & memories I want to share in this letter, but it is already wildly too long. 

I suppose I will leave you with that. I hope you know that I am always sending you love & wishing the best for you regardless of the ways we may have hurt each other in the past. I hope you have found someone you love & who makes you feel safe. You are a wonderful, kind hearted man in your core & she is very lucky to be loved by you. 

If you ever find yourself thinking of me, just sing one we know & I’ll be with you.

# Factors to Consider When Choosing a Side Table

I spilt a cup of coffee on my keyboard and while urgently wipe the liquid out i must have pressed some keys, and now my PC screen became yellowish. 

I went to Settings > Display > checked Night light, it's off. Also I checked the other options, but cannot find anything.

  
It must not be something on the monitor itself as well, since it happened right after i pressed some keys on keyboards. 

It's super annoying and I cannot find anything to make it back, do you know is there any keyboard shortcut that can change screen color?

","I am a single guy getting ready to travel the United States (similar to Jack Kerouac but without all the freight hopping). I'm 6'2, and 3 year dreadlocks, average build with tattoos and a completely countercultured non-materialistic mindset. Non-drinker, herbal connoisseur and psychonaut. I smoke Black American spirits and drink black coffee. Hey, we all have our vices.  Certified French chef, associates degree in logistics, and now a starving artist(with very elegant cursive handwriting), wanting to travel and see as much as I can and  experience even more of life. 
(I'll add a current picture soon)

I'd like some female energy around during my more than incomplete misadventures. I'd like to keep the balance of the masculine and feminine. Open minded, an overall positive outlook (but not for the point of toxic positivity), empathetic, understanding, and curious about life learning and personal development are a necessity. 

I guess what I'm looking for is somebody between 33 and 37. Between 5 ft and 5'6 tall no more than 150lbs. It would be great if you were counterculture oriented and understanding of various subcultures. I kind of like the more softer spoken people that are on the more introverted side.

1i1ugu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i1ugu8/how_to_create_a_minimalist_look_with_the_right/,How to Create a Minimalist Look with the Right Furniture Choices,"Minimalism is more than a design trend; it’s a lifestyle that embraces simplicity and intentionality. Achieving a minimalist look starts with making thoughtful choices about your [furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture)—selecting pieces that are functional, versatile, and stylish while avoiding clutter. Here’s how to curate your space with the right [home style furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) for a clean, sophisticated aesthetic.

# 1. Start with a Neutral Palette

Minimalism thrives on a neutral color palette. Whites, greys, beiges, and soft pastels create a calm and uncluttered environment. When selecting [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), prioritize pieces in natural wood tones, matte finishes, or monochrome shades that blend seamlessly with the overall design.

**Pro Tip:** Visit a [home furniture shop near me](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) to explore minimalist collections in muted colors and elegant designs.

# 2. Prioritize Functionality

In minimalist design, every piece of furniture should serve a purpose. Multifunctional items like storage beds, extendable dining tables, or nesting coffee tables are excellent for maximizing space while maintaining a sleek look.

**Examples of Functional Pieces:**

* A console table with built-in drawers for added storage.
* Ottomans that double as seating and storage.
* Wall-mounted desks to free up floor space.

# 3. Choose Clean Lines and Simple Designs

Minimalist home style furniture is characterized by clean lines, smooth surfaces, and understated elegance. Avoid ornate details, busy patterns, or overly complex shapes. Instead, opt for streamlined pieces that exude sophistication and simplicity.

**Styling Idea:** A low-profile sofa paired with a rectangular coffee table can create a balanced and cohesive look in the living room.

# 4. Invest in Quality Over Quantity

Minimalism is about curating rather than accumulating. Instead of filling your space with numerous items, invest in a few high-quality house furniture pieces that are durable and timeless. This not only enhances the aesthetic but also reduces the need for frequent replacements.

**Key Areas to Focus On:**

* A comfortable yet minimalist bed frame.
* A solid dining table with matching chairs.
* A functional yet stylish storage unit.

# 5. Incorporate Natural Elements

To add warmth and depth to a minimalist space, consider incorporating natural materials. Wooden furniture, rattan chairs, or marble-topped tables can bring a sense of organic beauty to your interiors without overpowering the simplicity.

**Pro Tip:** When visiting a home furniture shop near me, ask for sustainable options that align with your minimalist vision.

# 6. Keep it Organized

Clutter is the enemy of minimalism. Opt for home style furniture with built-in storage to keep your space tidy and organized. Sideboards, bookshelves, and storage benches are excellent for hiding away items while maintaining the clean lines of a minimalist design.

# 7. Add Thoughtful Accents

While minimalism focuses on simplicity, it doesn’t mean your home should lack personality. Add carefully selected accents like a single statement armchair, a sleek floor lamp, or a well-placed mirror. These elements can elevate your minimalist space without disrupting its harmony.

**Styling Tip:** Choose accent pieces in colors or textures that complement your primary palette for a cohesive look.

# 8. Create Space with Layouts

The placement of your house furniture is just as important as the pieces themselves. Arrange items to allow for open, breathable spaces between furniture. This creates a sense of flow and ensures the room feels airy and uncluttered.

# 9. Shop Mindfully

Finding the right home furniture shop near me is key to sourcing the perfect minimalist pieces. Look for stores that specialize in modern and contemporary designs, offering a variety of multifunctional and space-saving furniture options. Many shops also provide customization, allowing you to tailor furniture to your exact needs.

**Why Choose Minimalist Furniture?**

Minimalist furniture is more than a design choice; it’s an investment in a stress-free and harmonious living environment. By focusing on quality, simplicity, and intentionality, you can create a home that is both functional and beautiful.

**Final Thoughts**

Creating a minimalist look is all about thoughtful choices and intentional design. With the right home style furniture, you can craft a space that feels spacious, organized, and effortlessly elegant. Whether you're shopping for essentials or statement pieces, visit a home furniture shop near me to explore options that match your minimalist vision.

1i1ugli,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1i1ugli/slowed_motility_1_week_in/,"Slowed motility, 1 week in","Hi all, I’m  a week in to 18/6 fasting, eating at 1 pm and 7 pm, 2 meals no snacks. It’s overall going fine but I’m having some signs of reduced /slowed motility. This morning I felt like I had yesterdays dinner and maybe even lunch still in sitting high up in my guts and my wife mentioned my breath was awful (I can get really bad breath when I’m “constipated”)

I’m attempting to use IF to hopefully help sort out some long term gut issues and reset my insulin resistance and associated spare tire. I do a desk job with shift work and thinking it will be better to fast through my usual 2 nights perverse most of the time (emergency services employee and if it gets hectic I might have some carbs on hand).

Drinking plenty of water. Having 2 cups of coffee during morning fast portion. Getting reasonable fiber and plenty of movement.

It seems like the fasting period is slowing my digestion to a crawl. Am I making a wrong assumption? Has this ever self resolved over an adaptation period for anyone else?
