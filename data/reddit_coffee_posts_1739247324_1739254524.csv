Here’s How to Turn Them into Irresistible Benefits (With a Dash of Fun!),"Features are like vegetables at a kids' party necessary, but nobody’s lining up for them. Benefits, on the other hand? They’re the cake. 🍰 The gooey, irresistible goodness everyone wants a piece of.

So, how do you transform your “stainless steel blades” into “slice your veggies in 3 seconds flat so you can binge Netflix” magic? Buckle up, because I’ve got the cheat code:

# 1. Start With This Magic Phrase: ""Which Means...""

Example:  
🚫 *“Our sneakers are made from lightweight, breathable material.*”  
✅ *“Our sneakers are made from lightweight, breathable material* ***which means*** *your feet stay comfy and fresh all day, even if you’re chasing your toddler or running from life’s problems.”*

See? From boring science to foot hugging happiness.

# 2. Paint the Picture (Use Your Words Like Bob Ross)

Don’t just describe; *immerse* them in the experience.  
🚫 *“Our laptop has 16GB of RAM.*”  
✅ *“With 16GB of RAM, you can keep 20 tabs open while streaming a cat video, responding to emails, AND ignoring your boss’s Slack messages all without your laptop breaking a sweat.”*

# 3. Turn Up the Emotion (Nobody Buys on Logic Alone)

Make it about their feelings, not your specs.  
🚫 *“This blender has a 1000 watt motor.*”  
✅ *“This blender’s 1000 watt motor whips up smoothies so fast, you’ll have extra time to contemplate why you joined that gym you never go to.”*

# 4. Make It Relatable (Because We’re All a Little Messy)

People don’t care about *what it is*; they care about *what it fixes*.  
🚫 *“This vacuum has a HEPA filter.*”  
✅ *“This vacuum’s HEPA filter traps all the dust, pet hair, and regrets lurking in your carpet leaving your home guest-ready in minutes.”*

# 5. Keep It Fun (A Smile Sells Faster Than a Stat)

Your copy doesn’t have to be serious. Quirky, funny, and relatable will always stand out.

🚫 *“Our coffee keeps you energized.*”  
✅ *“Our coffee keeps you energized, so you can survive back-to-back Zoom calls without turning into a zombie.”*

Features tell. Benefits sell. Add a little “which means,” sprinkle on some emotions, and bam you’ve got irresistible copy!

Now, go forth and turn those ho hum features into benefits that people *actually* care about. Bonus points if you add a cat reference. 🐱

1ims2yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ims2yz/customer_crush_what_do_i_do/,"Customer crush, what do I do?","I am 20F working at a small coffee place and I have a regular 20M who comes in that I’ve always thought was cute. He’s friends with a few of my friends as well coincidentally. He is very polite and generous with tip as well lol. The only problem was that he had a gf. She came in with him a few months ago only a couple times. She was really just annoyed it seemed and would kinda stare me down when making his drink. I never thought much of it and decided to make sure not to be super friendly in case she got mad. She hasn’t come in since. Well as of a few weeks ago, he came in asking where I was while I was out of the country. He said he was wondering where I went which sure yeah that’s normal. Well the other day he comes in and makes conversation with me about my goals and college and what I want to do after I graduate. He was pretty curious but like I said it’s normal questions and stuff. He did add when he left though, ‘I look forward to seeing you more often’ which is kinda out of the blue but idk. My friend who follows him also said he took out everything from his social media about his gf including all photos and tags, and he unfollowed her. I don’t want to be like jumping the gun here but I think it’s pretty safe to say he’s single now. And idk if it makes me evil for wanting to make a move in the future. 

TL;DR I need help on what to do about my crush who is also a customer of mine in order to not make it awkward. ",1,1739254214.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1ims0kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1ims0kt/overworked_and_underpaid/,Overworked and Underpaid,"I’ve been stuck in this so-called “company” for a month now, and it’s nothing short of a nightmare. This place is a tiny startup, with less than ten of us, founded by someone who thinks he’s the next big thing in business but clearly isn’t.

The CEO? A total disaster. He believes my job description is an open canvas for whatever task he feels like throwing my way. Forget about what I was actually hired to do. Now I’m juggling everything from tech support, executive assistant to making coffee because, in his book, that’s what being a “team player” means.

Compensation? Don’t even get me started. I’m working 12 to 14 hours a day, including weekends, without a single penny for overtime because, according to him, “results matter, not overtime.” What results am I supposed to show when I’m buried under years of backlogs? I actually saw the old files and messages from previous employees, and guess what? Five people have cycled through in less than a year, most lasting only 2-3 months before they’ve had enough. I guess it’s really hard to work with a dickhead for a boss.

Professionalism? That’s a foreign concept here. This guy curses like he’s in a bar fight and communicates like he’s playing charades. There’s no respect, just relentless demands. If it weren’t for my dire need for money, I’d have left a trail of dust on my way out.

Each day is a struggle to maintain my sanity while this so-called leader treats me like his personal slave. I’m not just an employee, I’m part of his personal entourage, expected to leap at any task he decides is mine.

If I had any other choice, I’d be out the door in a heartbeat. But here I am, stuck under this tyrant, counting down the days until I can finally tell him where he can stick his “results over overtime” mantra. Until then, I’ll keep venting and looking forward to my escape from this corporate hell.

1imryc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1imryc3/advice_on_what_to_do/,Advice on what to do,"
Hi. I’m new here and a first time host mom. I have a wonderful and easy going 6 month old daughter, and both my husband and I are resident physicians working a combined 250 hours a week. My MIL was helping out with childcare, but we obviously needed  more help. For context, we needed additional childcare for over night shifts or on days when we’re on 30 hour call

We  pulled the trigger and got an au pair, as it made the most sense both financially and for our lifestyle. We signed up with cultural care, and matched with someone who was in the rematch. I wasn’t afraid of this process, as I had known many people who utilized Au  pairs, and sometimes the best matches occur through the rematch. We were so excited and I made a huge effort to include her as part of the family. 

Initially, things seemed to be going well. She was quiet but would sit with us and share her mate as she is from Argentina. For thanksgiving, I was sick with the flu, but she and my husband went to my MILs house with the baby and had a good time

Somewhere around thanksgiving and Christmas, she went out with a friend in the area, and came back demanding a car. I was confused bc when we hired her, we told her that there was not an additional car for use, plus she never got her US drivers license. She showed me my family profile where it said “car was available for use sometimes”. I felt terribly and clarified that I was under the impression that meant I would be able to take her places sometimes. The conversation was very intense as it seemed like a communication barrier was difficult to break through. Eventually my husband spoke to her in Spanish, and they agreed they would do some driving lessons and revisit the conversation when she got her license

By Christmas, things were warm again and I got her a Stanley Yerba mate set that she had her eye on and a matching stocking by the fireplace. I had work on NYE and NYD but she asked if one of her friends from the area could spend the night, and it wasn’t a problem. I made sure they had some fun snacks and some good movies to watch. I woke up at 3 am to them frying fish in the kitchen. I had work the next day and I did convey my frustration about it. I chalked it up to her being 19 and sometimes have bad judgement. The friend staying over was 26, and took the situation badly. Friend stormed out in a fit the next morning and refused to thank us or say goodbye. 

Tbe following week I overheard AuPair and Friend speaking poorly about me in Spanish. I didn’t bring it up to her personally, I figured they were just venting. I of course was hurt. I felt like I politely established rules for my home, and it should have been respected. The following few days were icy. I asked for us to sit down and talk. We had an emotionally honest conversation, she said she was homesick. She said she wants to go back home for 2 weeks, instead of the one week we had agreed on before. This is really stressful for me as I’m a resident physician and I do not get to decide what weeks I get off. Regardless, I arranged to move my shifts around, picked up midnight shifts, and made arrangements with MIL so she could have 2 weeks off. She did express her gratitude, which I appreciated. 


This coursed along with a few hiccups here and there, but nothing that was too egregious. For her bday in January, we got her a brand new laptop so she could finish her college courses as it was always her dream to attend the university of Michigan. I think she was shocked at the time, and never really thanked us, but it was nice to see her study with us. 

Things seemed to be moving along nicely, until a few weeks ago when I got a notification on my Nanit app that my daughter was screaming. I called Au Pair three times. No answer.  I called MIL. No answer. The panic I felt was intense. I checked find my friends and saw she was at home. I called over and over again over 90 minutes before she finally picked up and said she over slept. By this time I had left work, which required me to get someone to cover for me. I was obviously livid. We had a serious conversation that morning. 

What bothered me the most was her attitude about the whole thing. She was slow to apologize, she said no one handed her the monitor, but she shares the Nanit app with us. I finally said it seemed like the rematch was the best option moving forward, but she asked for another chance. Up until this point, she had never made a mistake with my child. I know we all make mistakes, so I agreed to give her another chance. 

The problem now is everything has just changed. The whole mood is just more tense. She is going out almost every night. She is eating in her room alone. The other night, the cops came to our house looking for her. Turns out she gave out our address to her dates, despite us asking her not to. That again really upset me. My husband who was home at the time feels like it was racially motivated by our neighbor and it feels unkind to fire her over it. I think she knowingly broke our rules and is getting away with it. 

When she first came, we had big talks about long term commitments. Things were going so well and it’s just shit how. Today she asked if we could go out for coffee together, and I want to tell her it’s not working out, but I just don’t have the heart to enter the rematch. I’ve asked her if she is happy in our home and her responses have been a half hearted “yeah”.

We sometimes still have moments where we laugh and we always have family dinner, but it feels forced. She does always take good care of my daughter, and keeps everything orderly and clean. My daughter really enjoys her and I have invested so much time and effort, that I’m not sure I can do it again. I am also afraid she’ll just leave and not stay for the two weeks that i will need for the rematch.  I feel dishearten by the entire process, plus I’m not even sure I could find anyone better. 

If someone with more experience could please give me guidance, I would be endlessly thankful. ",2,1739253710.0,Aupairs,0,1.0,False

What makes this route special is that it connects the sites through local neighborhoods, giving you a glimpse of authentic Shanghai life between the famous spots.

My latest favorite discovery has been the revitalized Suzhou Creek area ([https://go2shanghai.org/post/a-hidden-gem-exploring-suzhou-creek-unique-things-to-do-in-shanghai/](https://go2shanghai.org/post/a-hidden-gem-exploring-suzhou-creek-unique-things-to-do-in-shanghai/)).

The area has been transformed with beautiful walking paths, creative spaces in converted factories, and some of the city's best coffee shops.

# They were having a great time!

The biggest advantage they have is that they can easily scan the barcode of any food, input the data into a fitness app, and create their diet plan. In India, it’s not that simple.

Here is a complete [7-day Keto diet plan](https://www.ketoforindia.com/indian-keto-diet-plan/), and meal prep tips to set you up for weight loss success. 

# Day 1: Monday

☕ Breakfast

Bulletproof CoffeeOmelette with Butter and Bacon

# Directions & Ingredients

|| || |Step: 1|Whisk 2 eggs together| |Step: 2|Add salt and pepper| |Step: 3|Fry in 2 teaspoons of butter| |Step: 4|Add 2 Bacon (Pan-fried)|

Add one fresh cream in whisked eggs then pour into a hot non-stick skillet. Once it is cooked to a fine golden color on one side. Let it cook some more and take it off the pan.

🥗 Lunch

Mutton Seekh Kebab

Mutton Seekh Kebab

Because I work six days a week, my lunches must be portable and at room temperature. My freezer is always filled with ready-made mutton, chicken seekh kebab, and bacon.

Directions

I just took one seekh kebab out of the packet after thawing it.

1. In a non-stick pan, I shallow fry it in ghee.
2. Then I cut it into small roundels and pack it in a small Tupperware container.
3. You can sprinkle some chaat masala on it. Make sure to read the label because different firms have different breakups.

For emergencies and days when you don’t have time to prepare meals. Try your best to eat fresh food if that’s the case.

Blanched Broccoli with Salt and Pepper

Broccoli comes in very handy in Keto. It is a versatile ingredient that can be incorporated into all three meals. I always keep some blanched and ready in my fridge.

🍟 Evening snacks 

Milk is rich in lactose and carbs. Avoid it on a Keto diet. Cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt are all fine in moderation, but you should keep a careful eye on if they make you leave ketosis. In the evening I have a handful of peanuts. Somedays, I replace the peanuts with 6 almonds and 4 halves of walnuts.

🥘 Dinner

Omelette

Try Keto spinach egg omelet for the dinner. It is healthier than non-keto things and tastes better. When time is of the essence, the recipe is the favored choice because it requires less preparation.

Day 2: Tuesday

☕ Breakfast

Bulletproof Coffee

Start a day with Bulletproof Coffee, but you can switch it with green tea or any beverage.

Hard-boiled eggs with Mutton Seekh Kebab

Mutton Seekh Kebab

Mutton Seekh Kebab

The important thing to remember is that the mixture should not be overly moist or very dry, it should be of workable consistency. If you feel that the mixture is getting out of hand or not sticking to the skewer, beat an egg and add to it.
5. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees and cook the kebabs in it for 15 to 20 minutes. You can also barbeque them, but remember to baste them with butter or ghee at least 2 to 3 times.

Shami Kebab

For your Indian take on the Keto diet, I’m going to give you another recipe for a well-known kebab. This one promises to melt in your mouth. It is called the Shami Kebab.  It is made with minced lamb and can be made in batches and stored in the fridge. The preparation time is just 30 minutes, and cooking takes almost 20 minutes or less.

# Ingredients

|| || |Minced mutton (without fat)|500 grams| |Soaked split Bengal gram|2 tablespoons| |Psyllium husk powder|1 tablespoon| |Ginger and garlic paste|2 tablespoons| |Garam masala|1 tablespoon| |Green cardamom|2 pieces| |Cinnamon|1 stick or 1 tablespoon cinnamon powder| |Fresh coriander|half cup (chopped)| |Chopped mint leaves|a handful| |Egg|1 beaten| |Lemon juice|½ tbsp| |Ghee (for frying)|As per preference| |Salt|As per preference|

# Procedure

1. To the washed and drained mince add the Bengal gram. Although, I am just using 2 tbsp for 12 kebabs.
2. Add the ginger, garlic, and all the other increments except the herbs.
3. Now let it cool off.
4. Add the herbs to this paste and give it the form of dough.
5. You can beat the egg and add it to the dough. Or you can make small balls, flatten them out like a kebab, and dip them in the egg before frying. If you ask me I prefer to mix the egg in the dough and form the kebabs. That way the smell of the egg is not so dominant. You can also skip the onion if you want. You can either shallow fry them in ghee or deep fry them. Serve them hot with green chutney and a green salad.

Chicken Broth

This place is a tiny startup, with less than ten of us, founded by someone who thinks he’s the next big thing in business but clearly isn’t.

The CEO? A total disaster. He believes my job description is an open canvas for whatever task he feels like throwing my way. Forget about what I was actually hired to do. Now I’m juggling everything from tech support, executive assistant to making coffee because, in his book, that’s what being a “team player” means.

Compensation? Don’t even get me started. I’m working 12 to 14 hours a day, including weekends, without a single penny for overtime because, according to him, “results matter, not overtime.” What results am I supposed to show when I’m buried under years of backlogs? I actually saw the old files and messages from previous employees, and guess what? Five people have cycled through in less than a year, most lasting only 2-3 months before they’ve had enough. I guess it’s really hard to work with a dickhead for a boss.

Professionalism? That’s a foreign concept here. This guy curses like he’s in a bar fight and communicates like he’s playing charades. There’s no respect, just relentless demands. If it weren’t for my dire need for money, I’d have left a trail of dust on my way out.

Each day is a struggle to maintain my sanity while this so-called leader treats me like his personal slave. I’m not just an employee, I’m part of his personal entourage, expected to leap at any task he decides is mine.

If I had any other choice, I’d be out the door in a heartbeat. But here I am, stuck under this tyrant, counting down the days until I can finally tell him where he can stick his “results over overtime” mantra. Until then, I’ll keep venting and looking forward to my escape from this corporate hell.

Not sure if this is normal but I almost have an anxiety attack every other week since the start of 2025. I can’t sleep at night so I just read whatever on my phone. I’m constantly worried about not getting a job or that I am not doing enough to set myself to success. I attended most if not all career events in my school, I did a few coffee chat to attorneys in different fields but they are mostly biglaw, I have yet to reach out to another list of ppl whom I have dug out from my intended practice areas. I swear this is the hardest I’ve ever tried in my life both in terms of academics and networking. 

I also put great efforts into maintaining relationships with my mentors, the upper years in my clubs and one or two professors that I liked. I genuinely want to have long lasting relationship with them(because ppl in law schools are amazing). Plus maintaining them do help with my career I guess. 

I just started cold emailing to public interest clinics this past week, offering to volunteer for the summer, but haven’t heard back. I suppose they will take at least a week or two if they wish to get back. I know I should just send more and not think too deep but I am starting to question that perhaps I am just lacking, like lacking in marketing myself or having actually valuable experiences on my resume. I might have good grades(for now) but what if that’s not enough for the employers?

I am also worried that if I don’t have anything law related in the summer, then I won’t be competitive for the 2L OCI. And if I don’t secure anything in 2L then articling will be exponentially more difficult. This is not just for big laws but just generally any employers in the legal field.

Just some rant, letting it out makes me feel better, so does hearing what yall have in mind. ",4,1739252224.0,LawStudentsCanada,4,1.0,False

I'm a student from the United States who will be doing an internship in Perth from June-August. I unfortunately don't know much about Perth but the more I learn the more excited I am to be there, so I am wondering if anyone has any general tips/advice for living in Perth?

  
Some specific questions I have (but please just info dump anything from any topic! I'd love to learn):

\-How safe is it for women in Perth? are there general neighborhoods/areas I should avoid when I'm looking for housing?

\-On the topic of housing, what are some good places to stay in? Also, what is average rent in Perth (please let me know if you're using Australian Dollars, so I can convert it :) thanks in advance)

\-What is one thing you wish that every American in Perth knew (aka things I shouldn't do so I don't seem like a stupid visitor haha)

\-I'm mildly afraid of bugs and any creepy animals - what is typical to see in homes/how can I prevent these creatures from coming in? (Here in the U.S., when I mention I'm going to Australia everyone's first thing they say is ""cool!"" then the second is ""oh, the bugs..."" so i hope this stereotype is fake!)

\-What are some fun things to do in Perth? Nightlife, day-to-day activities, etc

\-What's the public transportation like?

\-I want to travel around that region (SE Asia/Oceania). What are some easy-to-get-to places from Perth money and time wise, and also what tips do you have for traveling in that area (doesn't need to be Perth-centric necessarily). 

\-What's the average cost of daily items? For example, a coffee, a small basic meal, groceries, train tickets, etc?

\-What are some must-do things in Perth at this time of year?

\-What is the weather like? I see on Google that it's 18-20C on average - is it dry, humid, colder, warmer, etc?

  
Answers to any of the questions above, or just general advice/tips are greatly appreciated! I'm so excited to explore this beautiful city and country :) Thank you in advance for your help!",0,1739252075.0,perth,6,0.25,False

For background my husband (35 m) has always been a flop when I (32 f) am sick. We’ve been together a long time and have 3 kids. I’m not just saying he didn’t care, he treated me like crap. Before anyone even asks “then why are you with him?” I’ll save you the boring, long explanation and just say it’s because I don’t really have a choice right now. 

It doesn’t matter if I have a cold or a major surgery, this man doesn’t care. It’s strange because in day to day life he’s a decent partner, but if I’m not there to carry my half, he drops the ball completely. He is incapable of caregiving. For reference he is the youngest child and only boy of 4 to sisters decently older than him. He was babied by them. I was the oldest daughter with no mother in the house, so growing up I was a constant substitute mother and he was the family baby, I think this carried into adulthood for both of us. 

All 3 of our kids were c-sections. He spared not a single helping hand after any of them. In fact, he ran off to go hang out with some female friend. After nearly every c-section. If you’re wondering if he was unfaithful, yes. After the first two kids he’d calmed down as a person. Then he had a hernia surgery, nothing huge, just a 1 inch scar, he didn’t get off the couch for two weeks. He could, the doctors insisted he did, just he’d scream every time anyone tried to make him get up, he peed in a coffee can for two weeks that I was dumping. I wiped his freaking butt when he finally pooped a week after surgery. Frankly he was a giant baby. I digress, I didn’t mind the labor part despite me knowing he was dramatic because our relationship had been much better, for years atp. 

Then I had our third child, no help. I developed gallstones 2 weeks after birth that triggered hours long gallbladder attacks, if you know the feeling, you know the pain is nearly indescribable. He left for work early every time to hang out with people. I have my gallbladder removed, he neglects to take out the trash despite me asking for hours and it spills onto the floor, so I take out the trash 3 hours after surgery. 

I get a cold this week, he can’t get anything done around the house and leaves me doing most things alone, but he wants to be babied. The whole house had a cold this week. He’s saying he’s cold and his body hurts, I tell him it’s a cold and he has no fever. He insists due to his place of work (a factory) he must’ve caught something more severe. He’s being ungodly dramatic, lumbering around the house, speaking with an extra stuffy nose, coughing as loud as he can from other rooms and “forgetting” to shut the bathroom door when he loudly blows his nose and waking me up. He keeps saying “tea sounds good” “soup would feel good” and looking over at me to see if I’ll do it and I’m so annoyed. He’s treated me so poorly whenever I’m sick and not in a position to mother him and now when he’s sick I can only feel irritation. ",2,1739252072.0,Marriage,10,0.67,False

Today, I woke up to someone questioning, “Why do you show off what you have? Do you think Reddit is Instagram or WhatsApp?” They argued that Reddit is solely for sharing information and knowledge. While I understand their perspective, I respectfully disagree.  

I’ve seen communities filled with adulterous content, discussions about hookers, prostitutes, and endless taunting instead of encouragement. While these topics may reflect a part of our world, they don’t align with the true purpose of humanity. For me, Its all about sharing meaningful information and to create a knowledgeable, compassionate community.  

That’s why I’ve taken a step to create a space where people can share their daily lives, thoughts, and experiences, without restrictions, but with purpose. This is a no-filter zone, but it’s not a place for mindless hype or irrelevant content. Before sharing, ask yourself- Does this add value? Is it informative or inspiring? 

Let’s be clear on one thing- this is “not” a platform for washing your dirty laundry or indulging in shallow, unreliable content. It’s a space for genuinely feelings, growth, and connection.  

Join me in building a community that values truth, respect, and meaningful conversations. Let’s rise above the noise and create something truly impactful.

1imrgrm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imrgrm,AIO for getting upset over discussions around P2025 and gender issues?,"Posting from burner account.

Context: this guy and I have been friends for over 10 years. He’s always had a center-right libertarian view on issues even though he has voted democrats in recent elections because he thinks MAGA is crazy. Whenever we discuss politics or anything in life, he always wants to be a contrarian or plays devil’s advocate. I find that part of him extremely annoying.

Prior’s Kamala’s loss, the democrats tried to pin Trump to Project 2025 even though Trump tried to distance himself from it rhetorically. I didn’t buy that for a second but my guy accused the democrats of fear-mongering and gaslighting voters with lies. Whatever, to each their own. I didn’t feel like debating with him at the time.

Fast forward to now. All Trump has done in the last 2 weeks was basically enacting P2025 agenda items one by one and nominating the chief architect of the initiative to be in his cabinet. I brought this topic up again in our chat, but instead of agreeing what we are all witnessing, he chose to play the usual contrarian again by questioning what’s wrong with P2025 and why should he be afraid it. He is a smart dude who keeps up with the latest but in this instance I perceived him as playing dumb by pretending to be “uneducated” about the topic and not trying to debate in good faith by bringing up right-wing media sensationalism headline “Pulling transgender funding in Colombia.” One thing led to another, we started debating about the bathroom gender issue. This is where I thought he came across as pretty homophobic.

Subjectively speaking, every time we debate he always gives this smug vibe. Honestly I’m tired of it. For instance when we debated the RTO policy a few years back, he played that same “parent” card as he did here trying to invalidate my opinion. He was pro-RTO and argued that people with kids should be more entitled to WFH than those without. 

I told my wife about this exchange of ours and she got very upset as well. Now he is no longer invited to our wedding later this year (he and his family would have to fly in from overseas) because we can’t in good conscience have him in the same space as that friend of ours.

Even spaces are characters, so when depicting them; focus on stuff like this.

That would be my goal to myself.

But I think the world would be more interesting if we paid attention to it collectively.

There is doctrine in language, and doctrine in space, and doctrine in form.

You look at a grass hopper and you know it is good at jumping and likely wants to jump often.

Its not always that visually obvious, but the doctrine: ""principle or position or the body of principles in a branch of knowledge or system of belief""; of a thing is often tied to its form.

That's why when manual labor was more common the working class would say ""you can learn a lot from a man by looking at his hands"".

Because whether the function sculpted the form, or the form discovered a function: the doctrine is usually betrayed by said form.

---

Brutalism; its about control.

Parasitic architecture; it's about freedom.

Desire paths, are when so many people take a path that the path becomes engrained in the grass by the democracy of travelers.

Paved roads, they can be convenient to travelers, but they can also be more convenient to those whom wish to set up shop next to said roads, or exact tolls from travelers whom see or have no opportunity but to use said roads.

__

Even the inanimate is storied, and is in an abstract sense: alive.

Including language.

I think I was on about how cool the idea of a frame shift was, whenever it was that this same guy talked about them.

That's the stuff they indirectly talked about in that movie where the aliens could see time simultaneously and communicated with coffee stains.

Because languages, they might arise out of neccessity or fun, but once they are there, they reflect their history, and it gets built into their asymmetries and their features.

That's why I'm working on a language.

I suspect I'm bad at language acquisition. But I've noticed people critique my english for being 'too wordy', which is one of the best critiques ever.

But is also why I'm trying to create a new language. So I can give myself room to grow.

I'm trying to migrate across space and time, to a new language which has room to become its own culture.

I just want space. And freedom. And family.

And it's heartbreaking in a certain sense that I have seen people critic my use of ""large words"" as a ""ploy to seem more intelligent""; as I often do feel unintelligent especially with regards to that which I love most; however; I am not hiding my ammaturish foolhardy disposition behind large words, nor do I think I am.

I brings me joy to have tool that I can dance with and stretch with and wander with and do battle with.

Written language is like a walking stick, you can fence with it, use it as a crutch, or, extend your hiking endurance, or ... use it as swag.

---

Math, is a form of language.

You write the thing down, or speak it, and it must obey poetic rules.

Then you may read it back and find where the rhyme breaks, or where the line falters, and you correct that.

---

My main problem with current english is that the priorities of the language reflect  a self absorbtion with its own culture.

After so many years of acquiring fun loan words, I feel a disturbance in the force.

I also don't appreciate how difficult it is to affect idiomatic writing of sounds due to the language's quirky self contradictory rules.

Ghoti is a valid phoenetic spelling of fish.

Just like kat is a valid phoenetic spelling of cat.

And although this is good fun, it stops being fun when, it begins making it impossible to know whether you are communicating clearly or not.

Hence why I'm workshopping a conglang.

Anyhoo. It's drawing practice time, and this is procrastination technically.

“Did you just dunk your croissant in your cappuccino?”

A young woman in her early twenties regarded the man, about 15 years her senior, with a mixture of concern and amusement. She sat at a café table, a perfectly bulbous croissant sitting on a plate in front of her. She had ordered a mocha cappuccino and eagerly awaited it before tearing into the croissant, even though she had no intention of mixing the two.  

Gently closing his eyes, he bit into a warm, coffee and milk soaked corner of the buttery pastry. He inhaled deeply through his nose, allowing his chest and shoulders to rise as if gently floating upward for a moment. Then–in one synchronized motion–he exhaled, collapsing down into his seat back and beginning to chew the warm soggy pastry.

When he looked over at her, she was sitting patiently, as if it were obvious that she would have to wait her turn. He took an actual sip of his coffee (the proper way) and half turned to address her. He could tell that she was calling his respect for the illustrious croissant into question. These accusations were slanderous and offensive. The French have been known to dunk their croissants. Of course, they probably had a more romantic word specifically describing the dunking of croissants in cappuccinos. Something regal, like “au jus”. Dunking really sounded like more of a donut activity. Nevertheless,  it reminded him of the first time he had witnessed someone defile a croissant in this way.

“I'm going to assume that you don't believe this is the appropriate way to enjoy a croissant.”

He eyed her with his eyebrows raised and slight smirk. A face that said that he knew that was exactly what she was thinking.

“I don't know.” The woman said, flattening her lips and slowly shaking her head in disapproval. “I just feel like a lot of work went into making it. It seems like a shame to just get it soaked in coffee before eating it. You don't get to experience all those layers.”

He picked up his croissant by its remaining tip, gesturing in her direction as he spoke.  “I know exactly what you mean.”

Looking down at the lopsided piece of bread, now approximating the shape of a cone, he guided it up and down like a conductor's baton as he spoke. 

“It seems a bit informal for such a graceful pastry. Almost like you're insulting it.” He leaned forward as if to tell her a secret, “Let me put you at ease; the French don't mind. They actually do it all the time.”

Although there was a table between them, they didn't have to speak very loudly. The small cafe was almost empty after the morning rush had subsided, and the tables were barely large enough for two people. Even still, she scooted over to the table next to his, almost as if to accept an olive branch and agree to discuss matters further. 

“It just seems like it would ruin the experience. I mean, I love all the crisp layers. I wouldn't think getting them all soggy would improve it.”

She was continuing to make her case but he could tell she was more open to the idea than she was letting on. This defense of the crisp layers, as she put it, was really just a defense of the only way she'd ever experienced a croissant. People always seemed driven to defend the way they did things before being open to changing them. 

The man smiled with one side of his mouth as he peeled away a layer from what was once the center of his pastry. 

“You know, I can remember the first time I ever ate a croissant. I mean a real one, not those Pillsbury rolls you can get at the grocery store. One made with actual care by an actual baker.”

Growing up in a New England suburb in the 90s, there weren't a lot of opportunities for a kid to wander into a French bakery or cafe. You were much more likely to have your first run-in with a croissant be a Dunkin’ Donuts breakfast sandwich.  Sure, it was a little more unique than a bagel. Then again, it was a Dunkin' Donuts bagel he had been comparing it to, and access to a good New York bagel shop was even more out of reach than a French cafe, but that's another experience story unto itself.

The man continued reminiscing. “That first real croissant is quite the experience. For that matter, so is your first real cappuccino. Trying to explain it to someone who never had one is difficult. Like explaining color to a color-blind person. Not quite as tough as if they were a fully blind person, but still frustrating. Sure, they know what coffee tastes like, so you could say it tastes like coffee, only better. But If you've ever had a great cappuccino, you know that doesn't quite cut it.”

The man sighed with disappointment “But then you have another, and another, and eventually they just don't quite deliver the same experience. Sure they're just as good as they always were, but you just don't care as much. The first times are always the best. They're the most interesting. Not only do you get to taste something spectacular but you get to create a new memory. You have a new perception in your brain that wasn't there before. That's what makes the first time the best. It’s exciting.”

He could tell by the puzzled look on her face that she wasn't fully getting it. He hadn't addressed the dunking. 
He had to buy a little more of her attention. 

“Just Go with me.” Good. That should work.

“One day, in a cafe much like this one, I saw it…”

His tone darkened as he leaned in toward her. 

---

“The dunk.”

---

She stared back at him flatly, “This seems a little dramatic…”

His pace hastened “It shattered all preconceptions I had about the formalities of the croissant easting process. Like seeing a man wearing sweatpants walk into a dealership and buy a fancy car in cash, damning decorum back to the limey British cotillion from whence it came.”

His face curled up, menacingly, “I mean, why shouldn't I dunk my croissant? It's mine after all.  I dunk my cookies in a cold glass of milk. My donut in a mug of burnt diner coffee. Why is the croissant so deserving of etiquette? I felt a swell of boldness welling up inside me as I reached for that croissant. It felt heavier in my hand with the burden of its new marching orders weighing heavy on its shoulders. To go where no croissant (at least in my hands) had gone before. The curving…”

The young lady attempted unsuccessfully to interrupt “Are we still talking abou…”

“THE CURVING serpentine glyph of cream gracing the surface of the espresso seemed to almost cower in fear. I lowered the tip of the croissant into the mug, feeling an unexpected resistance from the frothy surface. Eventually, my buttery bread breached the surface and it made way for a less viscous coffee beneath. Once adequately saturated, I drew it out like sword from stone, allowing it to drip back into the mug for a moment.”

He mimicked the action with the half-eaten croissant before him as he continued.

“Slowly, so as not to drip coffee on myself, I guided the pastry up to my mouth.” He stared at the real pastry in his hand as reenacted the story in real time. “As I closed my teeth around the saturated bit of bread, I realized that I had overestimated the force needed to tear into it. Like when you lift an empty gallon of milk thinking the jug is full. It melted away in my tongue like a piece of warm bread pudding.”

The girl was becoming increasingly intrigued, eyeing her plate. She seemed to have a growing sense of urgency about her forthcoming coffee. As she looked back at him,  she could see him chewing.

He went on. “We mistakenly attribute our joy to the latest vessel of our latest first-time experience. No croissant will ever be as buttery or flakey as your first. No cappuccino will ever be as rich and velvety as your first. And no cappuccino-dunked croissant will ever be as liberating as your first. Because what you come to realize is it’s about experiencing something truly new for the first time. It was never about the croissant or coffee or even dunking the croissant in the coffee.”  The man got up to leave, nodding a smile toward her just as the woman’s mocha cappuccino was arriving on her table.

“It’s about the first times.”

As he left, she glanced down at the croissant and coffee.

Long story short, one day in June I got tonsillitis and it kept coming back until December until I got a tonsillectomy on December 23rd. After my first case of tonsillitis in June I started to avoid certain foods and would only aim for drinks like iced tea, coffee, juices and when lunchtime came, I would just delay it saying I’m not hungry when in reality I just didn’t want to eat. Fast forward, November was when I realised I’m afraid of choking and can only eat foods such as ice cream, yogurts, mashed potatoes… basically anything that’s soft and requires almost 0 effort swallowing. Recurring tonsillitis made me have sudden severe health anxiety and panic attacks around food, like I literally can’t swallow some foods.. I got checked out and all seems normal physically, my psych told me that it’s just due to severe anxiety and everything will go back to normal slowly… he also told me that I likely don’t have Arfid. The fact that I got surgery def helped tons but I still avoid solid foods. Does this sound like Arfid to you? I feel like I’m going insane ",1,1739251382.0,ARFID,4,1.0,False

Itinerary so far:

Night 1: Arusha Coffee Lodge

Night 2-3: Tarangire Tree Tops Lodge

Nights 4-5: Ngorongoro Lodge Melia

Nights 6-8: Singita Faru Faru

  
We have booked Seychelles Waldorf Astoria for three nights after this but getting to Seychelles from Kilimanjaro is a long flight and would require us to stay for a night somewhere as a layover. Is it worth it to to travel that much to get to Seychelles? Do people have recommendations of somewhere better to go to round out the end of our trip?

Just ask around!","So, until this whole fiasco I never really paid attention to where are my products coming from; but I was very conscious about the quality and ingredients.

So it turns out a lot of our family shopping was already quite mindful and local.

Eggs for example, we live in Kitchener so we get our farm fresh eggs for $5 a dozen (Townline in Cambridge).
My closest store is Food Basics and I tend to buy Selection products - store brand products, and the things I buy are product of Canada!!

We're originally from Europe (Croatia) so we frequently go to European stores. The most important and money wise product I could suggest is powdered laundry detergent - Persil!!! The price can vary a lot from the store to the store, but from where I get it (Italo foods) it's under $80 an it lasts for more than a year (family of 4, 2 adults 2 kids plus)
The coffee we drink is Italian.
We cook from the scratch so the meat is usually not a problem because pretty much everything is Canadian and local (Ontario) , easily checked on the package. Produce can be tricky, I left the store without pears this week because everything was product of USA - but I got extra in Ontario grown apples! 

We are originally from Europe so maybe it's easier for us to ask and discover new stores because we're always on the hunt for something from our homeland.. But that's how we discovered so many gems hiding on local Plaza's, completely unappealing until you actually walk in and discover a treasure!
Ask around, people!!! 

Our biggest gem tho, was our local alcohol supplier! 
There's a little.... Distillery? I don't even know how to call it, lol. It's on our local Plaza, the gal is just supplying all the vine and beer, you buy it in bulk, in certain amount of bottles or kegs. Everything is locally produced (we do beer so I know my beer is from Caledon, Ontario) and oh my goodness it's so good - and you should trust me, I'm European, we know shit about beer 😁

For anyone from Kitchener, if you want more info, let me know.
For everyone else around Canada: ASK AROUND! We really do have gems hiding between all of the Walmarts and shit 😬",10,1739250762.0,BuyCanadian,0,1.0,False

We were together just over a year prior during which time he introduced my to many of his friends (being his old friends and their wives who all often hang out together as a couple). 

Prior to our relationship, he was in a 4.5 year relationship which never progressed to engagement or marriage, but she was best friends with pretty much all of his friends and their wives (as well as having her own friends). From his tagged photos, it looks like they all went out a lot together to gigs, dinners, little getaways etc. She is still “friends” with majority of them on social media but hasn’t spoken to any of the group since the breakup. Still, they were all close enough to spend that much time together and reach out to add each other on socials.

My husband says that was a long time ago and dynamics have changed in the group. Some have had 2+ kids, others are going through infertility struggles, some have moved cities or states etc. No one is really going out as much as they used to, he says, and we just see them over the occasional coffee. I know many of them have privately said to him they felt he rushed into marriage but once they met me, they all seemed to really like me and were very friendly. 

I still feel really insecure that I don’t have a more than surface level relationship with any of them.  When the wives want to organise something, they only reach out to him (with the understanding that he will pass on the invite & details to me). I’ve tried adding a few on Instagram after our wedding but they didn’t respond (and yet still continue to watch my stories).

After sitting with my feelings, I think my insecurities stem from feeling like his ex was really bubbly, extroverted and fun so they liked her better. Maybe I’m too reserved? Or maybe I’m overthinking and it’s normal to have no relationship with your husband’s friends.

You are offered to trial a new diet pill!,"The pill must be taken every day for 5 years to work. Outcomes will last until you die of old age, the results of this wonder pill are:
- healthy unsplit hair growth,
- greatly reduced subcutaneous fat,
- greatly reduced visceral fat,
- enhanced muscle toning and strength,
- clear skin with naturally occurring UV resistance,
- better collagen production!

You're going to be a hottie with the body, looking effortlessly at your best. The best part is:
**Once the five years of pills has been administered correctly, the results are permanent regardless of what you do for diet and exercise going forward.**

How to administer this diet pill? **Follow these rules** or suffer debilitating consequences!:
1. Take the pill once a day, every day.
2. *Only* take the pill once a day every day.
3. Ingest nothing else except plain unflavoured water.
4. Ingest NOTHING else (warning for the bedroom activities)
5. Only resume eating after the five years is over.

Fear not, you won't starve on the diet pill! Just experience mild hunger daily, 'feel a little snacky' you might say. 

**Consequences** for not adhering to the rules? There's a few and they all last until you die. So be careful not to trip up even once!:
- difficult bowel movements,
- never be under 40% body no matter how much you diet or exercise,
- always have a patch of acne somewhere on your body,
- get sunburnt easier,
- sped up receding hairline and hair thinning,
- always slightly out of breath,
- teeth yellowing,
- unable to tone those muscles up regardless of working out.

Fail and essentially you give up all chances you ever had at being a healthy hottie.


Are you willing to be a tester for the new diet pill?
How much is food a part of your social life?
How great is your willpower in the face of snackiness?
Do you value health and normative beauty standards over having a piece of cake with your niece? A glass of bubbles to celebrate a toast? A catch up over coffee?
Will your friends and loved ones tolerate you on this five year journey? 

**Will you sign up?**

""Yes ma'am."" the man said calmly, his hands placed atop his crossed knees. 

""Please..."" she sucked in a sharp breath, a quiet sob escaping her lips. She pleaded with the man, hoping she could invoke some compassion within him.

""What's it like?"" She whispered, taking his hand. The man laughed, guttural and deep.

""It's hell, Mary. What do you think it's like?""

Sheriff Thompson stepped out of his patrol vehicle with a grunt, being met by one of the officers on scene. 

""What we got?""

""Human remains. We found a hand, looks to be a woman's hand by the size and wedding ring. The neighbors found it and called, a man named Jacob Webb.""

With a nod, Sheriff Thompson walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

He stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and sulfur lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" He asked as he smeared some between his fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbor that found it?""

He was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer neither.

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Any other kids?""

""She had a husband but he died shortly after their only boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin' back then and I s'pose the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin', the next day he's...not. He was up walkin' around again like he weren't ever sick.""

Sheriff Thompson scribbled notes into his notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

Sheriff finished his notes and closed his book, tucking it into his breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr. Webb nodded, walking slowly back to his house. Sheriff Thompson went back into Mary's, continuing his observation of the scene.

The Sheriff walks into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank ya, Sheriff."" The coroner took a long drink from his cup as he sat down, blowing out a short quick breath. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that damn house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed the pictures to the Sheriff. 

""Well, the ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the bigger bone fragments in the ashes.""

The sheriff looks down at his hands, rubbing them together as if he could still feel the ash on his fingertips.

""They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not scorched part of the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that.""

The sheriff stood quickly, pushing his chair back in frustration. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah! We've been going over this case for weeks, we've been talking to every medical examiner, firefighter, police force and goddamned self proclaimed arsonist around and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense!""

Josiah sat back, placing his interlaced fingers behind his head. 

""Sheriff, I've been talking to some colleagues of mine about this to get their opinion because I was stumped too. After some some long talks and a few too many whiskey sours, I might have something. But sheriff, you have to trust me.""

""You know I trust you, Josiah, I need SOMETHING in this case.""

Josiah sat forward, looking for that trust in the sheriff's eyes as he pulled a stack of disheveled research papers from his desk drawer.

With a nod, Sheriff Thompson walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

He stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and sulfur lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" He asked as he smeared some between his fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbor that found it?""

He was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer neither. I walk in a little ways 'n see a hand on that chair so run back to my house 'n call the law. Now we standin' here talkin.""

""Did Mary have any visitors tonight that you saw?""

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Any other kids?""

""She had a husband but he died shortly after their only boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin' back then and I s'pose the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin', the next day he's...not. He was up walkin' around again like he weren't ever sick.""

Sheriff Thompson scribbled notes into his notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

Sheriff finished his notes and closed his book, tucking it into his breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr. Webb nodded, walking slowly back to his house. Sheriff Thompson went back into Mary's, continuing his observation of the scene.

<><><><><><>

The Sheriff walks into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank ya, Sheriff."" The coroner took a long drink from his cup as he sat down, blowing out a short quick breath. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that damn house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed the pictures to the Sheriff. 

""Well, the ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the bigger bone fragments in the ashes.""

The sheriff looks down at his hands, rubbing them together as if he could still feel the ash on his fingertips.

""They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not scorched part of the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that.""

The sheriff stood quickly, pushing his chair back in frustration. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah! We've been going over this case for weeks, we've been talking to every medical examiner, firefighter, police force and goddamned self proclaimed arsonist around and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense!""

Josiah sat back, placing his interlaced fingers behind his head. 

""Sheriff, I've been talking to some colleagues of mine about this to get their opinion because I was stumped too. After some some long talks and a few too many whiskey sours, I might have something. But sheriff, you have to trust me.""

""You know I trust you, Josiah, I need SOMETHING in this case.""

Josiah sat forward, looking for that trust in the sheriff's eyes as he pulled a stack of disheveled research papers from his desk drawer.

So it’s Junior year of high school and my friend group and I would regularly hang out every weekend to watch the sunset at this one hill spot. One night, my friend brings this one guy and tells us that they’re dating. I didn’t really pay attention to him that much but at first glance he was pretty handsome. THAT WAS ALL I THOUGHT! After that, he became friends with a couple guys in our friend group so I’d see him during those times for a bit. I didn’t talk to him, I didn’t even like the idea that he’d tag along sometimes but he did. And then weeks later news broke out in the friend group where my one friend was accusing him of cheating and we all just dropped him and never talked to him again after that.

Fast forward to 2025, Im playing around on Tinder and I match with him; as soon as he messaged I unadded him because I felt weird. He DMs me on ig asking why I did that and I just told him it was a bad idea. Anyways I then download hinge and I see him AGAIN messaging me, “you think I’m cute, I think you’re cute, would it really be a bad idea if we got coffee?” Obvi I folded because I thought it was cute that he was pushy and funny. 

The next day he takes me on one of the best dates I’ve ever been on in my life. We went to the same spot I first met him at, we smoked and got to know each other, laughed, gave out advice, it was great. After he took me to a really expensive sushi restaurant and paid for everything (I literally usually pay half or the full thing on other dates). He also told me about him and my friend, since I basically asked him about it and he told me that he didn’t like the idea that she was talking to a lot of guys and so he just ended up doing the same thing— they ended on bad terms and do not talk at all. 

Fast forward to now we text each other often and try to hang out whenever we can while we live our personal lives working and hanging out with our own family and friends. I really am starting to like him but I have a really awful feeling that my friend will be pissed off about it. I don’t want any bad blood, and I feel really guilty. Any advice?

[The Finest Little Honky Tonk on Skalga:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1i1z7g1/halin_and_tiltva_with_ray_on_the_honky_tonk_stage/)

Country music is a long and historied genre. All the highs and lows of life represented by over 100 years of music and larger than life performing artists. What follows is just a simple story about two Venlil, Halin and Tiltva, as they find their way in life after the events of NoP1 through the medium of old hick music and the comfort of a barn turned into a community cornerstone.

[Chapter 1:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1fivd6o/the_finest_little_honky_tonk_on_skalga_1/)

>!It's Halin's birthday and he wants to go to the popular Honky Tonk bar of Little Branson on the shores of the Mirror Lake on Skalga owned by the human Raymond Oakley. For his birthday trip, he takes his mother Kerila, his father Harvid, and his childhood best friend Tiltva. At Little Branson, they eat, get some cowboy gear, and drink as the band and line dancing start on up.!<

[Chapter 2:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1fnh0ya/the_finest_little_honky_tonk_on_skalga_2/)

>!It's still Halin's birthday at the Honky Tonk and Tiltva has some strong feeling for her best friend that aren't exactly reciprocated. She listens in to the music and a wave of the year's stress break over her. She recovers with the help of Kerila and gets back to watch the show. Afterwards, Halin goes for a picture with Raymond Oakley, but Ray finds Tiltva's voice to be [very interesting](https://youtu.be/g6ymXTFFtnc). Ray invites her and Halin to come be employees at anytime they need a job. Ray is politely declined. !<

They make up and make plans to go to Ray Oakley for jobs despite his attacks on Venlil.!<

They ask him about the attack and he shows the full video where a Venlil drunkard attacks a little Farsul girl and Ray retaliates by throwing him into the lake. Ray reveals that the little Farsul is his adopted daughter Thyla. He then offers the two jobs and they gladly accept. They return to Mirror Lake City where they both move back in with Halin's parents as they both lost their jobs and weren't happy with their apartments.!<

[Chapter 6:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1goqwt4/the_finest_little_honky_tonk_on_skalga_6/)

>!Bright and early, Halin and Tilva get up and head to their first day of work with Ray.

Ray catches her but it's too late, the Venlils' bellies are ticking bombs now. Ray explains Thyla and himself are both lactose tolerant. Before the inevitable trip to the toilet, they get to learn more about Thyla and Ray, and Ray reveals that Halin will be the new manager for the property while Tiltva will be the new singer for the band.!<

[Chapter 8:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1hiifb8/the_finest_little_honky_tonk_on_skalga_8/)

>!Still on the same day, Tiltva is with Thyla in the recording studio learning how to sing while Thyla does homework. Thyla falls asleep at her desk and Ray comes in to grab her. While he's there, he tells Tiltva to look up [a certain song](https://youtu.be/pwvW0mQ6KqA) that might help her find her feelings for Halin properly. As she and Halin leave later, Ray tells them to go to the Christmas party at the Honky Tonk but he and Thyla will be on Earth during that time.!<

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1imqeap,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1imqeap/husband_never_buys_me_gifts/,Husband never buys me gifts,"I’ve been married for almost two years now and some things are starting to irritate me.

My husband never buys me gifts.. he’s never bought me a birthday present or even a nikah gift.
it was my birthday a few days ago and he didn’t buy me anything. I was in a bit of a bad mood with him on the day of my birthday because we had a petty argument the night before. 
He sent me a screenshot of some makeup products while he was at work. But I just replied saying I don’t really need anything.
And he just said alright..
I’m not the type of person to ask for gifts. I don’t like people spending money on me but it would be nice to receive a gift on special occasions.

I never ask him to buy me anything. But I’ve bought him many things. I’ve bought him clothes, new eye glasses, thobes, beard care etc. I’ve even been spending money on groceries and household items which aren’t cheap. 
He pays for food when we go out to eat but sometimes I pay for coffee or dessert. 

I’m not a greedy person and I can’t get myself to bring up this conversation with him..

The only gift he’s ever bought me is some flowers.
The only thing I’ve ever asked him for is a wedding ring, and I still don’t have that either.

He’s a good husband and very affectionate. The only thing that bothers me is that he doesn’t buy me gifts :/",2,1739248189.0,MuslimMarriage,4,0.62,False

**Chapter IX**

**Paternal Nature**

Astral stepped down to the oni enforcers for the yakuza. They were calm, cool and collected, experience rang true in every stoic movement and glance. Astral nodded to them waiting for them to speak.

“The Patriarch wishes to speak with you.” Ken, the gray oni spoke and stepped aside to open the door

“Otto, right?” Astral nodded to the blue oni.

Otto nodded and stepped aside. 

“Any chance he’ll take a raincheck? I’ve had a weird as hell day.” He jerked his thumb back to the hut. 

The oni enforcers laughed and shook their heads.

“Sorry.” Ken gestured for Astral to get in. 

Astral sighed, shook his head and got in the car. He noted the driver was the green oni from the bathhouse, Akira if he recalled correctly. Then Otto got in on his right and Ken got in on his left. Classic intimidation tactics. Ken just nodded to the driver when he got in and they were off.

“So is this a situation where you’re gonna break my nose if I talk?” Astral asked.

“Only if you talk too much.” Akira chuckled from the front. “Boss has questions. Some things have been coming in. Thinks you’ll know what it’s all about.” 

Astral nodded, being seen as a professional, or at least knowledgeable on something was new to him. Though he had to admit if he needed to ask anyone for help in facing a daemon some night, he wouldn’t mind asking the yakuza for some backup when the time came.

He pulled out the bag he had won from Mama Yaga and looked over the chocolate treats before trying one to make sure they were safe. The men all chuckled as he did so.

“Mama Yaga doesn’t poison her treats.” Ken laughed, “Been here twenty years and only had problems with jerks and assholes.” 

“Twenty years?” Astral asked.

“She thinks the Purge will return. She liked eating them.” Otto added, “She’s welcome here, she helped our people the first time. If they are coming back we won’t turn down more help.” 

Astral nodded as he bit into the chocolate. It was sweet, definitely mixed for a child’s tongue, but also expertly mixed to have just a hint of raw cocoa flavor. He tied the bag up and was satisfied after that, chocolates were never his thing anyway, he preferred sour treats or sugary sweets.

Soon the car pulled up next to a plain looking office on the docks.The ride hadn’t been more than twenty minutes, mostly due to Akira’s knowledge of the shortcuts in the city. Astral had noted a few shops to look into along the way and tried his best to mentally note where they were. Once they were stopped outside Ken got out and held the door for Astral. The other two then drove with the car around the back while Ken escorted him inside. A very tired looking security guard looked up, but went back to reading his celebrity gossip magazine once he saw Ken. 

“Security’s tight.” Astral chortled.

“It is.” Ken nodded, “Man only lets me and the boss pass without issue. Akira and Otto will be a while.” He laughed as they got into an elevator. Ken pushed a button matched to a sub-floor. 

“Basements?” Astral arched his eyebrow, basements were unusual to see in Japan, especially on the coast.

“Reinforced bunkers left over from the war.” Ken explained, “Most of our unofficial offices are held in them.” 

Astral nodded as they got out on the third sub-floor. Ken led him through the hallways which were thick slabs of hardened concrete painted stark white, then they got to an area that had clearly been professionally widened. Ken stopped at wide double doors and looked Astral over curiously.

“Boss is inside, he doesn’t want us around. Thinks we’ll provoke you.” Ken stepped closer to Astral. “You try to hurt him and you won’t have to worry about him being indestructible.”

Astral looked the oni in the eyes, his true form put them at about an equal height and the oni man was not a stranger to having to get rough with people. Astral just nodded in understanding, he wasn’t here to fight anyway. Ken nodded and then opened the doors.

Astral stepped through and into a room lined with what appeared to be century old movie posters, or at least around the time. They were for mostly American and European films, but he spotted more than a few for some classic Japanese films. At the far end of the room a large  desk sat with an overly large chair with no one sitting in it. Astral let himself glance to his right where a sitting area was arranged with couches and a long coffee table. Kenzō Kaneda sat in a large framed chair that was against the wall, staring directly at him. 

“Welcome Mr. Freiheight. I trust the trip was acceptable.” He sipped at a cup of something that smelled of green tea and something else he couldn’t place a finger on.  

Astral nodded, “It was decent.” 

Kaneda smiled and gestured for Astral to sit. Astral sat directly opposite the patriarch and waited for the man to speak. Kaneda sat his tea down first, but cleared his throat and got to business.

“You came seeking daemons. Your western interpretation of great evils?” Kaneda probed carefully.

Astral nodded, he hadn’t revealed that bit earlier, but he supposed that his recent actions could have given that away. “More like shoved into a closet and found a cockroach infestation, but yeah.” 

Kaneda nodded, “We don’t speak of them often. They are nasty things and are often kept at bay by the kami, but...” He paused.

“Something got in.” Astral nodded and pulled the coin the priest had given to him the first day.

“Yes. We have found those in odd places.” Kaneda pushed forward a wooden box with a seal on it. “These still contain great evil on them.” 

Astral nodded, “I had to dig a little, they’re coins for favors owed or bought by daemon lords. One side is red, the other black. The black side is the debtor and both sigils of the daemon lords are engraved on them. If they still have energy they haven’t been cashed in.” He tossed the daemonic drachma he had received earlier on the table.

“How...” Kaneda focused on the box. “What are they made of?” 

“Souls.” Astral said, “Or the husks of them anyway. I don’t know how to free those changed, or if it’s possible.” 

Kaneda nodded. “I see. But they are responsible.” 

“They have a daemon knight, servant of Mammon I think. Greed and power are his domains. Don’t let that fool you though, daemon lords are lords for a reason.” Astral explained, “I need to find this guy and put his lights out permanently, he’s already completely stolen a body and manifested on this plane, so he is extremely powerful. More so than even I am right now.” 

Kaneda looked at Astral with a fire in his eyes, “And how do you plan to protect those close to you?” 

“With my life.” Astral said flatly, “And let’s not be bashful school kids, you’re worried about Ukiko.” 

Kaneda blinked, but nodded.

“Ariane’s observant and she’s drawn a few pictures I saw.” Astral smiled, “But I had my suspicions.” 

Kaneda nodded, “I became this as a result of seeking revenge against another family for killing my wife. Do you know what I am?” 

“Gashadokuro. I had to look that one up, I wasn’t big on yokai as a kid.” Astral grinned, “But I can’t imagine your fellow yakuza want to keep at this.” 

“Gashadokuro do not always follow the same rules. My men gave their souls to give me the strength to topple our enemies. I struck our enemies down in vengeance and now I must see us through to a place of power.” Kaneda nodded and closed his eyes as he took a breath.

Astral felt a distinct pang in the air as Kaneda did so. He took a moment to look the man over and had a disturbing realization. “You regret your actions.” 

“I regret many things. Losing my daughter’s trust chief amongst them.” The man’s eyes seemed to lose some light as he spoke. “But I must continue for their safety as well as hers.” 

Astral nodded and leaned back, but gave a deep sigh. “I know you probably don’t want to hear it, but I do supposedly work for a god who’s all about forgiveness.” 

“Your god cannot save me. I am a yokai now. I am the blood of Japan.” Kaneda smiled, “When I die I will be forgotten, known only as a monster. That is the fate of all gashadokuro.”

Astral sat for a moment, but leaned forward. “I don’t believe in any fate but what we make.” 

“Terminator.” Kaneda pointed to a poster. “I enjoy that one. Very good bad acting and very good effects for the time.” 

Astral looked at it and blinked, “Jess, you stole the best line ever from the Governator...” 

Kaneda laughed, “A friend?” 

“More like a sister.” Astral admitted. “And if you are worried about Ukiko, trust me she has more protection than just me.” 

Kaneda stared at Astral, then leaned back. “The Fallen?” 

Astral laughed, “I mean, I think he likes her, but no. Ariane. Whatever she is, she is powerful, more so than even she can fathom. She kinda needs guidance for that.” 

“And so you and Ukiko have stepped in.” Kaneda smiled, “The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.” 

Astral glanced at the man questioningly. 

“Please take care of both, for your sake as much as theirs.” Kaneda smiled.

“I’m just a problem solver.” Astral sighed.

“Most fathers are.” Kaneda nodded and pushed the box forward. “If you take that to the Tengu they can purify and release them. Tell them I sent you and that we all need to work together.” 

“And how am I supposed to carry that thing?” Astral snorted, “Now seriously, that’s gotta weigh a ton. What is that made out of?”

“Mahogany.” Kaneda said simply, “And yes it’s heavy, but why would that be an issue?” 

Astral stared at the patriarch for a moment and lifted it up. “Man, this is so inconspicuous.” He walked around the room hefting the box about.

Kaneda nodded. “I understand now.” I hadn't considered that. Would you be amenable to being driven there in the morning?” 

Astral put the box down. “Go drop off a treasure chest of evil coins so Tengu can purify them and get the bird people to help defend Tokyo? Yeah I’m not sure I’ve got a full plate I think.” 

The vein on Kandea’s forehead pulsed in just the right way that Astral cracked a smile immediately.

“I can do it, just don’t have an aneurysm or whatever a skeleton giant has.” Astral chuckled, “Just make sure they come after breakfast. Ariane’s a big eater and I get the feeling I’ll be making breakfast tomorrow.” 

“My men will see you back.” Kaneda nodded and leaned back.

Astral waited just a moment longer. 

“Yes?” Kaneda asked.

“Three things. First, don’t take me for an errand boy, I hate that. We both know this is something bigger than either of us right now.” Astral counted off on his fingers. “Two, don’t think you’ve gotten one over on me, I don’t know how you found out about me hunting daemons but I will find out. And three, seriously, you can find redemption, even kami have paths for that, right?” 

Kaneda glared at Astral, his temples pounding in obvious anger.

“I’ll see myself out.” Astral nodded, “And I guess a number four. She doesn’t hate you at the very least.” Astral slipped out the double doors quickly after that.

“Good talk?” Ken asked.

The sound of a table splitting echoed through the room. 

“I should go.” Astral nodded.

“Yeah.” Ken nodded and walked with him to the front door where Akira and Otto were still arguing with the security guard. 

“Come on.” Ken chuckled, “We better take him home fast.” 

“Did you piss the boss off?” Otto asked.

Astral smiled and nodded like a five year old who found a hidden cookie stash. 

Otto groaned, “I’ll go check on him. You two get him home.” Otto rushed to the elevator.

“You are a pain.” Akira sighed and motioned for Astral to follow.

“I’m blessed that way.” Astral laughed.

Twenty minutes later he was unceremoniously shoved out of the yakuza car at the entrance to his apartment. He went up in the elevator and knocked on Ukiko’s door, it was past sundown at this point and he wasn’t certain where her day had taken her.

“Oh, Astral.” Ukiko smiled as she opened the door, “I was about to order a late dinner, want in on it?” 

Astral was about to decline when his stomach spoke for him. “Desperately.” 

Ukiko smiled, “Come in. Ariane’s been drawing like mad today. And I have good news!” 

Astral smiled back, “I’m no longer chained to the Vatican?”

“I’m working on that. They make quitting impossibly hard, did they take lessons from Japan?” Ukiko laughed.

Astral snorted, “Possibly. Also, hide these from Ariane. They’re treats for her, but there’s a lot.” He handed the bag of chocolates to Ukiko. 

“How...” She blinked, “Where did you get these?” 

“Baba Yaga’s hut.” Astral said flatly. “And no I will not elaborate, trust me you will sleep better that way. But they’re safe and the old witch wanted Ariane to have some treats so I’m not going to say no.” 

“Fair.” Ukiko pulled a few out, “She’s already had dinner so a few wouldn’t hurt.”

“Asty!” Ariane came peeling around a corner and slammed into his legs.

“Treats!” Ukiko laughed as she held the candies out. 

“Oh!” Ariane smiled, “For me?” 

“Met an old lady who wanted you to have them.” Astral patted her on her head.

Ariane smiled and took the treats, then handed one to Astral and Ukiko. 

“Thanks.” Astral smiled and put it in a pocket in his coat. “I’ll have it after dinner.” 

“Ukiko worked all day.” Ariane frowned and crossed her arms. “What’s your excuse?” 

“I have had a weird day.” Astral sighed, “And I got to meet Ukiko’s dad.” 

Ukiko froze. “Fuck.” 

Ariane looked up and scrunched her nose. “Bad word!” 

“Don’t worry. You still don’t have to talk about it.” Astral smiled lightly, “He only got a little overprotective anyway. Then I pushed buttons.” He then tousled Ariane’s hair once again. “Go play, please.” 

Ariane nodded and rushed off.

“Astral!” Ukiko gasped, “Are you insane? No, wait, I know the answer.” 

Astral chuckled, “I’ll explain it all while we wait for dinner.” 

“I’m just getting pizza.” Ukiko shook her head.

“Ah, the option for people who have given up on the day.” Astral nodded in understanding, “I completely agree. Can we get some soda with it? Possibly breadsticks?” 

“Sounds amazing.” Ukiko smiled, “Also, when you have time I found some offices for you to open your Private Investigation business. We can look whenever’ is good for you.”

Astral gave a slight chuckle, “Not tomorrow. Come on, you order, I'll tell you the batshit day I had.”

“Bad word!” Ariane shouted from her room.

“Adult!” Astral countered petulantly. 

Ukiko just laughed and nodded as a strange sense of comfort washed over her.

Then other things like protein shakes, milk in coffee and an occasional snack throughout the day. 

I’m steadily increasing my weight which is what I want but my question is this diet okay? I feel like I am eating too much protein (the above average day lands me around 275g of protein) & too much chicken. I feel fine and am not over eating to the point I feel sick. I am just worried this much chicken/protein could be bad for me. Any thoughts? also curious on other people’s diets since running burns so many calories it’s hard to stay on top on eating.

1imq5xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1imq5xy/ubereats_support_sucks/,ubereats support sucks,"I can't deal with Uber Support anymore. Lately, I've had multiple issues with my orders—some arrive damaged, some have missing items, and others have been outright stolen, totaling over $400 in losses. Every time I reach out to Uber Support, whether for stolen or damaged food, they tell me the order isn’t eligible for a refund. Strangely, this only seems to happen with orders I pay $90 or more for, and I don’t understand why.

Tonight, I’m especially upset because I’m pregnant and was really craving a Duc de Lorraine. Since the restaurant is far from my house, I also ordered a coffee which the reason I ordered . But when the driver arrived he  spilled the coffee at my apartment door. Not only did I not get to drink it, but I also had to clean up the mess. When I submitted a picture to Uber, they again told me the order wasn’t eligible for a refund.

I just don’t understand—what actually *is* eligible? On top of that, the customer support agents are consistently rude, talking as if they’re the ones paying for my order.",0,1739247425.0,UberEATS,4,0.5,False
1imq5eh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imq5eh,“Sweet Graffiti” opens 2/11,"I don’t know if Sweet Graffiti qualifies as a bakery! 😆 

Apparently they do a “pad Thai”’ cookie and Dubai chocolate bars (believe that is pictured above). 

They are reported to be opening tomorrow (2/11), however information and pics are not plentiful. This seems promising: 

“The company’s pastry chef Romina Peixoto and the team are whipping up desserts including stuffed chocolate bars like the Oaxaca (mole, corn tortillas, coffee) or the Dubai (pistachio, rosewater, kataifi); alfajores; and pad Thai cookies (peanut butter, lime, and coconut). There’s also passionfruit or matcha flan and cold sweets like flyers (frozen doughnut-shaped desserts), ice cream bars with fun shells, and soft serve.”

51 W. 32nd Street near Harold Square.

1imq591,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imq591,My birb wished me Happy Birthday! 🎉❤️,"I forgot to share this earlier, it made me so happy to see a Happy Birthday message from Sunshine. 🌞 I also hatched a new micropet, got a mystery gift and received 3 gifts from my wonderful friends (I dk if they got notified of my birthday or they were just being kind). I love this app so much!

I took this while Sunshine was still in her nightgown, slippers and having coffee this morning.

Slide to see the fairy princess outfit I dressed her in today. (Inspired by Luck & Veronica). It took me all week to decide on her outfit, I didn't have all the items I needed. I love this outfit though. The February/Valentine's items have been so good, my favorites so far! ❤️",8,1739247361.0,finch,0,1.0,False

I definitely could use a bit of distraction as I plow through. Open to chat about all sorts of stuff, doesn't matter who you are where you're from as long as you're an adult.

I'd say I like the same things as most people, reading, tv, movies, mostly in the sci-fi, fantasy, and horror genres. Definitely like being outdoors, don't mind the cold weather at all, and enjoy my morning coffee and evening drinks. And if you got a spooky tale to tell me I'm all ears. Feel free to drop me a line and let me know how your weekend went and how your week is shaping up to go. Hope to talk to some of you soon.",0,1739247332.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False
