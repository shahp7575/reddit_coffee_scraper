I genuinely don't get the hate for the Dodge Caliber SRT- 4.

Sure, the base Caliber models were crap, but the SRT- 4 version was great. It made the Caliber actually look pretty good, plus it came with a manual and made almost 300 hp from factory. It's pretty spacious, I can fit well being 6'5"" and I'm not too uncomfortable in the rear seats. It has a pretty big trunk, and the most bass I've ever heard in a car. However, it was a FWD, and the interior was full of plastic. But if you can look past those two issues, it's actually not a bad car. Mine currently has around 95,000 on the odometer, I and I have seen these get at least double that. In terms of modifications, you can easily make around 350 - 400 on stock internals. In terms of uniqueness, less than 6000 were made, so you'll probably be the only one with a Caliber SRT- 4 at cars & coffee.

We‚Äôve been friends for 6 months now and instantly clicked, 1 of them through mutual friends (Coffee) and 2 being through school volleyball (Curtain and Cans) and I really find them pretty and generally attractive both girls except for Coffee being a boy

And throughout our friendship the only reason why I RECENTLY found out they were in a relationship is because my friend, Cans scrolled through chats with Coffee really quickly to find a photo and some of the messages I saw were like all lovey dovey romantic and not platonic. The other half is Curtain just joking around and being more touchy with me like touching my butt which is all jokes and laughs ahahah and just teasing me and is touchy with Coffee and Cans too


So, when Coffee asked me I was ironically surprised even though I actually knew when we were having a sleep over during the weekends getting ready to sleep. It was like, ‚ÄúWe wanna ask you something, and say you won‚Äôt get weirded out for real deaduzz‚Äù
I say I won‚Äôt since I really don‚Äôt give a darn and then Cans just says bluntly, ‚ÄúDo you wanna date all 3 of us.‚Äù

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

To my surprise, the strawberry subtly mellowed out the strong flavor, making the coffee smoother and slightly fruity. It wasn‚Äôt noticeably sweet, nor could I distinctly taste the strawberry, but it definitely enhanced the overall flavor in a way I didn‚Äôt expect. The result was richer, more balanced, and honestly, pretty enjoyable.

My Recipe:

Coffee: 22g medium-dark beans from Tulum

Grinder: Timemore C2 (18 clicks)

Steps:

1. Grate some frozen strawberry into the paper filter before adding the ground coffee.

2. Add the coffee grounds, then grate a bit more strawberry on top.

3. Brew with 4 pours:

First 3 pours: 75ml each, spaced 45 seconds apart (swirl after the third pour).

Final pour: 100ml, stirring clockwise and counterclockwise with a spoon to extract some more flavors.

This was a total experiment, pieced together from various brewing techniques I‚Äôve come across online. And you know what, it kind of worked! May not be the best approach with swirling and stirring but hey, worked for me. 

Have any of you tried adding frozen or grated fruit to your coffee? Did you get similar results?

Next, I‚Äôm thinking of trying blueberries, apples, or maybe even grapes‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt decided yet. But I‚Äôm definitely recreating this because it was such a fun experiment, and the final cup made for a great start to my Saturday.

Silent
The house was quiet. Too quiet‚Ä¶
The only sound came from the Quran record player, its verses drifting through the still air in the lowest volume possible.
I opened my eyes. The living room was dark except for the faint glow from the hallway. I glanced at the clock‚Äî3:00 AM. I must have fallen asleep by accident.
Iran a hand over my face, feeling the roughness of my beard. , my hair, as always, was a mess-curls that never settled no matter how much I tried. The dim light from the Quran player cast faint shadows on my bronze skin, making my dark eyes even darker than I felt. 
A tightness coiled in my throat, a phantom itch that wouldn‚Äôt go away, like something unseen was choking me. But knowing my father was home made the loneliness a little easier to bear.
I stood up, stretching slightly, and walked toward the hallway. He was where he always was at this hour‚Äîon his prayer mat, praying ‚Äòwitr‚Äô in quiet devotion.
In the kitchen, I poured myself a glass of cold water, then made my way down the hallway. My eyes landed on that door. Dust covered its frame. Locked, as always. I never tried to open it. Never dared to. Even though I knew what was inside‚Äîburned paintings and bad memories.
I took a sip of water, staring at the door handle.
Don‚Äôt.
Something in my chest whispered, warning me. But I ignored it. My fingers brushed against the metal grip. I twisted it. Locked. Of course.
My heart pounded.
I turned away, but hesitation gnawed at me. Maybe... maybe he kept the key in his office.
Silently, I slipped inside.
The drawers weren‚Äôt locked. He never expected me to look through them. It didn‚Äôt take long before I found it‚Äîa small, worn key.
As I entered the forbidden room, the door creaked loudly, cutting through the silence like a blade.
Dust swirled in the dim light. The air was thick, heavy, untouched for years. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, scanning the space. Paintings. Dozens of them. Some were charred at the edges, others perfectly intact.
But all of them‚Ä¶ all of them were of women.
Women with no faces.
A shiver ran down my spine. My stomach tightened. Something was wrong with this room.
Then‚Äîa sound behind me.
I spun around, heart in my throat.
My father stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable.
""So‚Ä¶ the day has come, huh?""
I exhaled sharply. ""Dad, you scared me.""
Silence stretched between us. His eyes swept over the paintings, distant, lost in something only he could see. He looked... miserable.
I hesitated, then asked, ""Why don‚Äôt any of them have faces?""
A small, sad smile tugged at his lips. ""I guess your mother was a bit mysterious.""
I swallowed hard. ""Do you miss her?""
For a long moment, he didn‚Äôt answer. His gaze fell on a painting‚Äîfour women standing in the desert.
His eyes glistened. ""everyday‚Ä¶.""
Then, without another word, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone with the faceless ghosts on the walls.










Chapter 1
Ghosts in the Morning
I started my morning with coffee in hand, standing in the middle of the room, staring at the faceless woman‚Äôs.
Trying to find answers in their hollow features.
Coming here had become a habit. I never dared to touch anything, never moved a single painting.
I sighed, running a hand through my hair before stepping out, heading to work.
Driving through the city, my mind kept circling the same question‚Äîwhy did he never talk about her?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The office was the same as always. Another day, another pointless assignment.
I never loved being a journalist. It wasn‚Äôt my dream. It wasn‚Äôt even my choice.
It was just the only major I got accepted into.
My father never cared. He had wanted me to be a doctor.
‚ÄúSayaf!‚Äù
‚ÄúOh. Hay, Morning boss.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe need to talk. Come to my office.‚Äù
I followed him, wondering what I had done this time.
His office was cold‚Äîtoo cold. The walls were white and bare, not a single personal touch. It didn‚Äôt even feel like someone sat there every day.
Weird.
He sat down, folding his hands together. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a new case I want you to cover.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, sure. Can you give me some details?‚Äù
‚ÄúA house burned down. No evidence of who did it. I need you to investigate‚Äîget info from the police. We have to be the first to cover it.‚Äù
I froze.
A house burned down.
A flash of memory hit me like a punch to the gut.
I was seven. Lying in bed when I heard the noise.
Something in my mother‚Äôs painting room.
Then‚Äîmy father‚Äôs voice, screaming.
I got up, heart pounding, feet dragging me toward the sound. I was scared. But I went anyway.
I thought‚ÄîI thought I could help.
But when I got there, I saw.
A voice cut through my thoughts.
‚ÄúHey‚Äîare you even listening?‚Äù
I blinked, swallowing hard. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôll do it. Just give me the contact numbers.‚Äù
I stared at the phone number on my desk, tapping my fingers against the paper. Do I really want to know what happened?
A voice pulled me from my thoughts.
‚ÄúYou look like you just walked out of a battle.‚Äù
I turned to my coworker, who leaned against the doorway, arms crossed.
""Always in black, always exhausted. Ever thought of wearing something that isn‚Äôt a black thobe?""
I shrugged, running a hand through my hair. ‚ÄúWhy ruin a habit?‚Äù
He smirked. ‚ÄúAnd the beard? You growing it out for a secret society or something?‚Äù
I ignored him, shifting my gaze to the phone. The half-finished sketch beneath my fingertips caught my attention‚Äîabsentminded strokes of faceless figures. My mother‚Äôs influence, maybe.
Pushing the thought aside, I pressed the number. It rang once before a voice answered.
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù
‚ÄúOfficer Omar? This is Sayaf from The Saudi Daily News.‚Äù
A pause. Then, ‚ÄúYeah. You‚Äôre calling about the house fire?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to take a look at the case files. I have the approval papers.‚Äù
Another pause. A faint shuffle of papers in the background. ‚ÄúAlright. Come by at noon.‚Äù
‚ÄúAppreciate it.‚Äù
Hanging up, I exhaled, rubbing the back of my neck.
""New case?"" my coworker asked.
""Yeah. House fire. Four dead. No suspects yet.""
His eyebrows lifted. ""Sounds complicated. Need help?""
I shook my head. ""I‚Äôll manage.""
________________________________________
The precinct smelled of old coffee and printer ink. Officers moved between desks, their voices hushed, papers rustling. The weight of unsolved cases lingered in the air.
A young officer approached me, dark circles under his eyes, his beard unshaven. He looked like he hadn‚Äôt slept in days.
""You Sayaf?""
I nodded.
""I'm Omar. Follow me.""
We walked down a hallway lined with case-boards‚Äîcrime scene photos, scribbled notes, red markers circling key evidence. Some officers barely glanced up, lost in their own work.
Omar stopped at a door and gestured inside. ""This is Investigator Saad. He‚Äôs handling the case.""
Through the glass window, I saw a man hunched over his desk, sifting through documents. He looked hollow, like someone who had spent too long staring at death.
I knocked.
Saad glanced up, eyes scanning me before he nodded me in.
I stepped inside. ""Sayaf. Journalist.""
""Yeah, I know who you are."" He gestured to the chair. ""Have a seat.""
I remained standing. ""I was hoping to get details on the burning house case.""
Saad exhaled, rubbing his temples. ""Alright. Here‚Äôs what we know.""
He flipped open a file. ""February 24th. 2:45 AM. We get a call from a foreign worker‚Äîhouse on fire, Ahmed Road. Took firefighters eight minutes to arrive. Too late. The place was gone.""
He turned a page. My eyes flickered over crime scene photos‚Äîa house reduced to blackened ruins, four bodies barely recognizable beneath the ash.
""The victims?"" I asked.
""A family. Father, mother, two kids. All in their beds. No signs of struggle.""
I frowned. ""They didn‚Äôt wake up?""
He tapped a paper. ""That‚Äôs the strange part. No signs of escape. No forced entry. Whoever did this was someone they knew. The fire started on the father‚Äôs side of the bed. He was the target.""
My fingers tightened around the armrest. The smell of smoke ghosted through my memory.
Fire. Silence. My mother, smiling through the flames.
I swallowed. ""Where did the father work?""
""CEO at Emad Corporation.""
I glanced back at the crime scene photos. ""Any suspects?""
Saad closed the file. ""None yet. But something about this case feels off.""
I knew that feeling.
It was the same feeling I had the night my mother burned.
The drive to the burned house felt longer than it should. My mind swirled with questions. How could someone do this?
I had seen the crime scene photos‚Äîash everywhere, blackened walls, unrecognizable remains‚Äîbut nothing could prepare me for seeing it in person.
The neighbourhood was eerily quiet. Every house looked identical‚Äîmodern, gray, lined with trees‚Äîuntil I spotted the ruins.
A charred skeleton of a house.
I pulled over, gripping the steering wheel. My heart pounded so hard it felt like it might break free from my chest.
The yellow police tape fluttered in the wind, barely keeping the place contained. A lone officer stood guard, cigarette hanging from his lips, eyes glued to his phone. He looked like he couldn‚Äôt care less.
I exhaled sharply, ran a hand through my hair, and stepped out of the car. The smell hit me instantly.
Burned wood. Melted plastic. Fire.
The scent dragged me back to a night I didn‚Äôt want to remember.
Flames swallowing paintings. My mother‚Äôs face flickering in the light.
I forced the memory down and walked toward the officer.
""Hey.""
Without looking up, he muttered, ""No, you can‚Äôt go in. And no, it‚Äôs not haunted. Stop wasting my time.""
I pulled out the approval papers and held them up. ""Sayaf, journalist from The Saudi Daily News. I have clearance.""
He glanced at the document with dead eyes, sighed, then stepped aside. ""Go ahead.""
I turned to face the house. Hollow. Blackened. Silent.
________________________________________
Inside the Ashes
There was no door anymore‚Äîjust an open space where one used to be. I stepped inside.
The living room.
I tried to imagine it before the fire‚Äîmaybe a family sitting together, laughter, warmth. But now? Just ash and emptiness.
I moved down the hall.
The master bedroom.
Sanad‚Äôs bed‚Äînothing left but a charred frame. Whatever hadn‚Äôt burned was twisted beyond recognition.
The hallway led to another door, half burned, still standing. Something about it caught my eye.
I pushed it open.
The kids‚Äô room.
Pink. Just a faint, ghostly trace of color on the wall where fire hadn‚Äôt reached. The bed frame was still there, blackened but standing.
A tightness built in my chest. They died here. In their sleep.
The silence pressed down on me.
________________________________________
Stepping outside, I spotted a man standing near a car across the street.
His eyes met mine.
He hesitated, then spoke. ""Sad, isn‚Äôt it?""
I nodded. ""Yeah.""
""They were a happy family.""
""Did you notice anything strange that night?""
""No."" He shifted, then added, ""But‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs this guy. Comes here every day at noon. Just sits in his car. Cries.""
I narrowed my eyes. ""Do you know him?""
""Yeah. He was close to Sanad. They were good friends.""
""That‚Äôs all you know?""
He nodded.
I exhaled. ""Thanks.""
Walking back to my car, my chest felt tight.
I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.
Four people burned alive. No struggle. No way out.
The smell of ash clung to my clothes, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt just that.
It was in my throat. Choking me.
And for the first time in a long while‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt stop my tears.

By the time I reached home, the sky had darkened. 7 PM.
I walked inside, and my father was on the couch, watching the news. He glanced at me.
""You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.""
I hesitated. ""It was a rough day.""
For a second, I just stood there, watching him. The thought of losing him twisted something inside me.
It had been a long time since we spent time together.
I swallowed. ""Dad‚Ä¶""
He muted the TV. ""What?""
""Let‚Äôs go out. Have dinner somewhere.""
He raised an eyebrow. ""You sure you‚Äôre, okay?""
I forced a smile. ""I just‚Ä¶ miss you.""
His face softened. ""Alright. Where to?""
""Anywhere. Just get ready.""
He chuckled. ""You seem excited. Miss your old man?""
I didn‚Äôt answer. I just watched him as he got up and walked toward his room.

We went to an Italian restaurant. The smell of fresh dough filled the air, mixing with laughter and the hum of conversations.
For the first time in a while, my father looked‚Ä¶ happy.
When the pizza arrived, he smiled faintly, running his fingers along the edge of the plate.
Then, almost in a whisper, he said, ""Pizza was your mother‚Äôs favourite.""
I froze.
It was the first time he had mentioned her in years.

Chapter 3

5:10 AM.
I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself to get up and face another day of work. Yesterday was the first time I‚Äôd felt some semblance of happiness in a while, and I don‚Äôt want to ruin that mood now. My gaze shifts to the nightstand, where the last family photo of Mom sits. She was tan, with long black hair, hazel eyes that always looked a little sleepy, and thick eyebrows. I look a lot like her.
I gather the strength to sit up and head to the bathroom, longing for a moment to pause life‚Äîjust for a while. Thirty-four years since I was born, and I should be happier than this.
I stand and make my way to the bathroom. As I pass my dad‚Äôs bedroom, I notice that he‚Äôs already gone‚Äîhe must have left for the mosque. Prayer time is just thirteen minutes away.
At the office, I check in and let my boss know I need to leave early. I‚Äôm headed to investigate a case at the company where Emaad used to work.
I walk to his office. As always, he‚Äôs seated behind his desk, doing nothing.
""Good morning, boss.""
He raises an eyebrow and looks up.
""What happened with the case?""
""I went to the crime scene. Took some notes, and I‚Äôll send you a copy. But I need to visit the company where he worked to gather more information. Hope that‚Äôs okay.""
""Forward me what you have, and you‚Äôre excused. Keep working on the case.""
""Thanks.""
I turn to leave, but he calls after me.
""Sayaaf.""
I glance back.
He leans back in his chair. ""I trust you with this. Don‚Äôt disappoint me. Get the information before anyone else does.""
I nod, walking out of the office.
I head to the car, my mind already on Emaad‚Äôs company. When I arrive, the atmosphere is different‚Äîeveryone seems so content, absorbed in their work. I nod at the security guard, and he raises his phone to make a call.
""There‚Äôs a man named Sayaaf from the Saudi Daily News here to talk to some of Sanad‚Äôs coworkers.""
""Yeah, sure, I see him,"" the security guard replies before hanging up. He looks at me with a soft smile.
""He was a good guy,"" he adds. ""You can wait here. Someone will be with you soon.""
I sit on the couch and scan the office. It‚Äôs nice. I almost wish I worked here instead of the dreary place I call an office. The sun pours in through large windows, and plants are scattered everywhere, giving the place a fresh, open feeling. It feels alive, unlike my cold, lifeless office.
The sound of footsteps breaks my thoughts.
""Hey, Sayaaf. I‚Äôm Yasin, the new CEO of this department.""
Yasin. New CEO. Not bad, I guess. He seems like a good guy.
""Hello, Yasin. How‚Äôs your day? I‚Äôm here to talk to anyone who knew Sanad personally to gather information about him.""
""You‚Äôre in the right place. Follow me.""
I walk beside him, exchanging pleasantries. The office smells like Eid‚Äîclean, fresh, and full of life. I notice employees working, others laughing and talking. They‚Äôre all so happy, so different from the grim atmosphere I‚Äôm used to.
""We‚Äôre here.""
We step into his office, which is nothing like my boss‚Äôs. It‚Äôs full of life‚Äîwhite walls, brown furniture, plants, and a large window that looks out onto the busy street.
Yasin gestures for me to sit. ""Coffee?""
""Sure.""
""Black?""
""Yeah.""
He calls for an assistant to bring the coffee, and I take the opportunity to scan the room. There‚Äôs a picture frame on the desk. Two little girls, light skin, brown hair, smiling. One of them is wearing glasses.
""Your kids?"" I ask.
Yasin‚Äôs gaze shifts to the picture, his expression darkening.
""Sanad‚Äôs,"" he replies quietly.
I‚Äôm about to ask more when he speaks again.
""This was his office.""
""Yeah. After he passed, I took his place, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to remove anything. My heart wouldn‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôm still in denial about it.""
I let the silence hang for a moment before asking, ""Can you tell me about him? Were you close?""
Yasin exhales. ""We weren‚Äôt extremely close, but we had a good relationship. I worked under him for seven years. He might have seemed tough on the outside, but he had a soft heart.""
""Did he have any close friends?""
""Not really. He mostly stayed in contact with his assistant, Noor. I think I‚Äôm the only one who knew him personally.""
""Anything unusual? Did he have anyone he confided in outside of work?""
""Well, there was one person‚ÄîAzam. He mentioned him a few times. Azam used to visit his office now and then.""
Azam. That name sounds familiar. Could he be the guy who was crying in the car?
""Do you have any suspects?"" I ask, trying to steer the conversation toward the case.
""No, not really. He was a bit rough with the employees, but they all liked him.""
Just then, a woman knocks on the door and enters. She‚Äôs wearing a green abaya, with long curly hair, and her hijab is neatly arranged. She smiles as she hands Yasin a cup of coffee.
""Here‚Äôs your coffee, sir.""
""Thank you, Noor.""
I freeze. Noor? Is this the same Noor?
""Can I ask her a few questions?"" I ask.
""Sure,"" Yasin says, smiling.
Noor looks at me, uncertain.
""Hello, Noor. How‚Äôs your day? I‚Äôm Sayaaf, a journalist with Saudi Daily News. I‚Äôm just trying to gather some information about Sanad‚Äôs case.""
Her expression changes, the smile fading.
""Yeah?"" she says, her tone wary.
""Can you tell me about him?"" I ask.
""I don‚Äôt know him that well,"" she says, her voice tight. ""He was a good guy, though. A little mysterious. We only really talked about work.""
I nod, sensing she‚Äôs holding back.
""Thank you, Noor.""
I glance at the clock‚Äînoon already. I‚Äôve gathered enough for now. I take a final sip of coffee and stand to leave.
""Thanks, guys. That‚Äôs all I need for today.""
As I head out of the office, I think about the next step. Maybe I‚Äôll head to Sanad‚Äôs home. There‚Äôs a chance I‚Äôll run into Azam.
When I arrive at Sanad‚Äôs house, my gut tightens. A black Range Rover is parked in front, and I spot a man with a shaggy beard and white hair inside. His eyes are fixed on the house, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to notice me approach.
I knock on the window.
He turns, his eyes red-rimmed, as if he‚Äôs been crying for hours.
""Azzam?""
""Yeah?"" he replies, his voice hoarse.
""It‚Äôs Sayaaf. I was wondering if we could talk.""
""Who are you?""
""I‚Äôm a journalist.""
""Are you trying to make money off this tragedy?""
""No, Azzam. I have my reasons. Just hear me out.""
He doesn‚Äôt respond. Instead, he turns his face away and rolls up the window. I move to the passenger side, open the door, and slide in.
""What are you doing?"" Azzam snaps. ""Get out!""
""I know it‚Äôs hard to lose someone,"" I say quietly. ""I know how it feels to never get answers... to never hear their voice.""
Azzam‚Äôs gaze softens, but he doesn‚Äôt speak.
""My mom... I was seven when I lost her. She was burned alive, just like Sanad.""
Azzam stares at me. ""You were just a kid.""
""She wasn‚Äôt born that way. She was in an accident. When she woke up, she couldn‚Äôt speak. Never told anyone what happened.""
Azzam takes a deep breath.
""We were friends since middle school,"" he says, his voice cracking. ""I never thought I‚Äôd lose him this way.""
""Tell me about him,"" I urge. ""What can you tell me to help me catch whoever did this?""
Azzam is silent for a moment.
""He didn‚Äôt have any enemies. He loved his wife, his family... everything was good, except...""
""Except what?""
""He had a mistress. No one knew about her. He felt guilty, so he ended it, but...""
""Did you tell the police?""
""No, I didn‚Äôt want to ruin his reputation.""
""Do you know her name?""
Azzam hesitates. ""I think it was Noor.""
Noor. The same Noor I just spoke with.
I get out of the car and head back to the company, my mind racing. I wait for the employees to leave, watching my phone for a message. It‚Äôs from Grandma:
""Hello, Sayaaf. I missed you. Hope you‚Äôre okay. Can you come by if you have time?""
I look up to see Noor leaving the building, looking cheerful as she walks to her red convertible. I step forward, approaching her from behind.
""Hey, Noor.""
She turns, surprised.
""It‚Äôs you again,"" she says.
""Yeah, can we talk?""
""I‚Äôve already told you everything I know. There‚Äôs nothing more to say.""
""Noor, I know.""
""What do you mean?""
""I know what you did.""
Her expression falters.
""What? What are you talking about?""
""You killed them, Noor.""
Her eyes widen.
""It wasn‚Äôt me! What are you accusing me of?""
""Noor, don‚Äôt make me go to the police. Tell me everything, now.""
She goes still, then turns her back on me, getting into her car. She drives off without a word.
I take a deep breath and text her:
""Meet me at the coffee shop under Emaad‚Äôs company at 8 PM.""
I don‚Äôt expect a reply, but a few minutes later, I see the ""seen"" notification. Still, no response. I contact Investigator Saad, telling him everything I‚Äôve gathered. It turns out he already knows about Noor. He‚Äôs found something on Sanad‚Äôs memory card.
At 8 PM, I arrive at the coffee shop, hoping Noor will show up. After an hour, I‚Äôm ready to leave. But then, I see her. She walks in, still wearing the same outfit from earlier. She sits across from me, looking composed, almost too confident. She smiles, but it‚Äôs different this time‚Äîcalm.
""I‚Äôll tell you everything,"" she says, her voice low. ""But promise me you won‚Äôt tell anyone.""
""Talk.""
Noor‚Äôs Perspective
Sanad and I had a long history. He promised me he‚Äôd marry me, but after three years, he realized he loved his wife and didn‚Äôt want to continue. On February 24th, I went to his office to talk, but the conversation shifted to food. I offered to cook something for him, something special, and I told him I‚Äôd send it to his house. He hesitated but agreed. ""Tell her it‚Äôs Azam‚Äôs wife‚Äôs cooking,"" he said, and that‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîhe was leaning toward me again.
I cooked the dish and added something to make them sleep. I had a copy of his house keys, and no one would notice because I always wore the black abaya when I visited. After an hour, I went to his house. I saw him sleeping beside her, happier than ever, like I never existed.
I spilled gas on his bed, then splashed it around the house, trying to erase everything he had. I left, threw a match on the gas, and watched it burn.
Sayaaf‚Äôs Perspective
I‚Äôm shocked. She talks as if she‚Äôs done nothing wrong, like it was all part of the plan. This woman is a sociopath. I sit in silence, trying to process what she‚Äôs just admitted.
""That‚Äôs it?"" I ask, voice shaky.
""Is it?"" she replies.
""Don‚Äôt tell anyone,"" she warns. ""And don‚Äôt write about it. I just wanted to answer your questions.""
Before I can respond, the door bursts open, and police flood the room, guns raised.
""Don‚Äôt move! You‚Äôre under arrest for the murder of Sanad and his family.""
                                                                         ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô I got up, heart pounding, feet dragging me toward the sound. I was scared. But I went anyway.
I thought‚ÄîI thought I could help.
But when I got there, I saw him.
Chapter 4
I returned home after a long night, exhausted. The garden I had spent hours in felt like another world compared to the stillness waiting for me here.
As always, the Quran played softly in the background, its verses echoing through the quiet house. I walked toward my bedroom, but as I passed the hallway, a dim light caught my eye.
It was coming from my mother‚Äôs painting room.
My feet hesitated, something deep inside me resisting the pull of that door. But curiosity‚Äîor maybe something else‚Äîpushed me forward.
I stepped closer.
Through the gap, I saw him.
My father sat on the floor, surrounded by dust-covered paintings, holding one in his hands. The dim glow of the lamp cast long shadows across his face, tracing the deep lines of age and grief.
His lips moved, murmuring something I couldn‚Äôt hear. His fingers trembled as they gripped the frame. His usually composed presence was crumbling, and for the first time, I saw it‚Äîthe weight of loss settling into his features.
A few strands of his greying hair fell over his forehead, and in the dim light, the roughness of time was etched into every wrinkle.
I knocked lightly on the door.
He looked up.
For a moment, neither of us spoke. Then, gathering myself, I finally stepped inside, closing the distance between us.
I sat beside him.
His black eyes met mine, heavy with sorrow.
""I‚Ä¶ I always wondered why she left us."" His voice was barely above a whisper.
I swallowed, my throat dry. ""Maybe it was God‚Äôs plan.""
He took a deep breath, his gaze drifting back to the painting.
""She used to sit in that chair,"" he murmured, nodding toward the empty space by the window. ""Candles lit all around her, the window open, painting for hours. This room was always filled with colour, with life‚Ä¶ Until that day. After that, everything changed.""
His voice cracked on the last word.
I stayed silent.
""She used to play with your hair until you fell asleep,"" he continued. ""She never spoke to you, but I know she heard you.""
The memory felt distant, like an old dream I wasn‚Äôt sure was real.
""Her white dress,"" I said suddenly, the image surfacing from the depths of my mind. ""She always wore it. Sometimes it was covered in ink, sometimes in paint. But she was always smiling.""
A shadow crossed his face.
""She had something in her eyes, though,"" I added. ""Something I never understood.""
He turned to me, his expression unreadable.
""I never heard her voice."" The words slipped out before I could stop them.
For a long moment, he didn‚Äôt respond.
Then, his hand reached out, rough and warm, wrapping around mine.
""We should get some sleep."" His voice was gentle, but distant.
He stood up, leaving the room.
Leaving me with open wounds and no answers.
________________________________________
I let out a breath I didn‚Äôt realize I was holding and stood, ready to follow him.
But before I could leave, something caught my eye.
A hair tie.
It sat on the desk, untouched, covered in dust. My fingers reached for it instinctively. A single strand of black hair clung to the fabric.
I exhaled, holding it in my palm.
Then, my gaze landed on the desk drawer.
It was old, barely used, dust collecting along the edges.
Should I open it?
My fingers hesitated at the handle. But something inside me‚Äîcuriosity, desperation, something deeper‚Äîpushed me forward.
I pulled it open.
Inside, buried beneath old papers, lay a small notebook.
Dust coated its cover, years of neglect settling on its pages. I wiped it clean with my sleeve, flipping through the empty sheets.
Until I found something wedged between the pages.
A badge‚Äîand writing.
My hands trembled as I read.
________________________________________
Dear Mother,
I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm better than ever.
Sayf has been a good father‚Äîtaking care of us, taking care of me. Washing my hair, washing away my sadness.
Sayaf is getting older. He even started walking.
He is the best thing that ever happened to me after I lost the ability to speak.
Now I understand.
You used to tell me, you won‚Äôt know how I feel until you have your own child.
I miss you.
If you need anything, you can contact Sayf. He has been taking care of me.
________________________________________
My vision blurred as tears filled my eyes.
I clenched the notebook shut, swallowing the lump in my throat.
I placed it back in the drawer, letting my fingers linger for just a second longer.
Then, without another thought, I reached for my phone.
Opening Grandma‚Äôs message, I stared at it for a moment before my fingers started typing.
""Hey, I missed you too, Grandma. I've been a bit busy‚Ä¶ You know, life. Anyway, what time do you want me to visit?""
I hit send.
And for the first time in a long time, I felt like I needed to go home.
I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night.
Too many thoughts raced through my mind, tangling into knots I couldn‚Äôt untie.
As a kid, I used to think that Mom writing everything down was just a game‚Äîa funny habit, something special between us. I never realized she was actually unable to speak.
Why?
Why did she lose her voice?
Why did Dad never give me answers?
I had spent years avoiding these questions, burying them under routine, pretending they didn‚Äôt matter. Contacting Grandma had always been difficult after Mom‚Äôs death. Maybe because her voice‚Äîher warmth‚Äîreminded me too much of the mother I lost.
I never wanted to remember that night. Never wanted to know why it happened.
Never wanted to know why she burned.
But now‚Äîafter working on the case, after seeing those ashes, after meeting Noor‚Äîsomething shifted in my chest.
Something cracked open.
A curiosity‚Äîa restlessness‚Äîan ache I had ignored for too long.
And worst of all‚Ä¶
Why don‚Äôt I remember anything?

10-Year-Old Sayaf‚Äôs POV
Early morning. The kitchen smelled of bread and strawberry jam.
I sat at the table, swinging my feet, watching Dad prepare my usual jam-and-cheese sandwich. He worked with slow, precise movements‚Äîlike he was painting, not making breakfast. Sunlight hit his face, making him look softer than usual.
""Dad?""
""Yeah, Sayaf?""
He glanced up, then did a double take. ""Still in your pyjama‚Äôs?! You‚Äôre going to be late!""
I fidgeted. ""My uniform is dirty.""
Dad muttered under his breath. ""Ugh. I must‚Äôve forgotten to take it to the dry cleaner.""
I waited, hoping he‚Äôd find another solution.
""No worries. You can wear your old one,"" he said, wiping his hands.
""But Dad, I‚Äôm taller now‚Äî""
""Sayaf! Now!""
His voice was sharp. Too sharp.
I flinched. My chest tightened. My throat burned. Tears welled in my eyes before I could stop them.
""If Mom were here‚Ä¶ she would‚Äôve cleaned it.""
The words slipped out before I could think.
Dad went still.
His features softened‚Äîbut in a strange, unnatural way.
He took slow steps toward me, kneeling until we were eye to eye. His hands rested gently on my shoulders.
""Sayaf, honey‚Ä¶"" His voice was different now, calmer. ""I‚Äôll clean it. Just go eat your breakfast. It‚Äôs ready.""
________________________________________
I must have fallen asleep while lost in memories.
The ringing phone jolted me awake.
I reached out blindly, still groggy. ""Hm?""
A familiar voice filled my ears.
""Hey, Sayaf.""
I froze.
It was her.
Soft. A little aged. But still her.
I sat up fast, eyes blinking at the screen. I checked the number‚Äîjust to be sure.
Grandma.
My heart squeezed in my chest. It had been so long.
""Hey, Grandma‚Ä¶ How are you?""
""Alhamdulillah, Sayaf. I‚Äôm good. Finally hearing your voice‚Äîit feels like my soul just returned to me.""
Guilt settled in my stomach.
I swallowed. ""I‚Äôm good, Grandma. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ good.""
""Can you pass by at noon?""
I glanced at the time. 7 AM.
I was already late for work.
""Noon is hard, Grandma‚Ä¶ how about 7 after work?""
""That‚Äôs fine, honey. I‚Äôll be waiting for you.""
I stood up, heading to work, but my body felt heavy‚Äîtoo heavy.
Like someone was choking me from the inside. Like my chest had been cracked open and barely stitched back together. My breath was shallow, my muscles tense. My eyes burned‚Äînot because I cried, but because I couldn‚Äôt.
Why now?
Why, after all these years, was it haunting me?
It felt like a locked door in my chest had finally been forced open.
And the case‚Ä¶ the case had been the key.
________________________________________
""Let‚Äôs all take a moment to appreciate Sayaf‚Äôs work on the case.""
My boss‚Äôs voice barely registered.
Everyone clapped. Hands patted my back. ""Great job, Sayaf!""
I forced a smile. Like this case hadn‚Äôt just ripped me apart from the inside.
I walked to my desk in silence. The case didn‚Äôt have me in its grip. No. It had swallowed me whole.
A coworker leaned over. ""So, did she light it up with a match?""
A match.
A match.
The word slammed into my brain like a hammer against glass.
Something inside me cracked.
________________________________________
7-Year-Old Sayaf‚Äôs POV
A strange noise woke me.
I crawled out of bed, following the soft scratching of a brush against canvas.
Mom was painting.
She sat on the floor, surrounded by candles, her white dress covered in ink stains. She glanced at me, smiling, then went back to her work.
I sat beside her, watching the way her brush moved, how calm she was.
On the table next to me was a box of matches.
I don‚Äôt know why I grabbed it. I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking.
I flicked one against the rough edge.
A small flame came to life.
It flickered in my hands, dancing. I was mesmerized.
Then‚Äîit burned too close.
I yelped, dropping it.
The flame licked the corner of a painting. The dry canvas caught fire instantly.
I stumbled backward. My heart pounded.
Mom turned, her smile disappearing in an instant.
She screamed.
Her dress caught fire.
Then‚ÄîDad appeared.
He stood at the door, staring.
His face was expressionless.
I turned away. I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt know why I just walked back to my room.
Why didn‚Äôt I stay?
Why didn‚Äôt I do anything?
________________________________________
I gasped, snapping back to the present.
My breath hitched. My hands were shaking. My throat was dry.
""Did I‚Ä¶?""
""Did I do it?""
The office walls felt like they were closing in. I pushed my chair back, stood up so fast it nearly fell over, and stormed out.
I needed answers.
I needed to breathe.
I barely registered the roads as I drove, my hands gripping the wheel too tightly.
Before I knew it, I was outside my grandmother‚Äôs house.

I barely parked the car before bursting out of it.
I ran to the door, knocking hard‚Äîtoo hard.
The door creaked open.
A foreign woman stood there. ""Hello, sir?""
I ignored her. I was already inside.
The smell hit me first. Old wood. Incense. Dust and roses.
Everything was exactly as I remembered it.
The furniture hadn‚Äôt changed. The floral wallpaper was still there. My mother‚Äôs pictures lined the walls, frozen in time.
It felt like I was nine years old again, visiting with her.
I walked slowly, my breath uneven.
Then‚ÄîI saw her.
My grandmother.
She sat in her old chair, wearing a white prayer dress, glasses perched on her nose. The Quran rested in her lap, her lips moving in a soft whisper.
She looked smaller than I remembered. Older.
She glanced up.
And in that instant, I broke.
I dropped to my knees, grabbing her hand, my chest heaving.
""Did I do it?""
My voice cracked‚Äîchoked.
She frowned, placing a warm hand on my face. ""Bismillah, Sayaf‚Ä¶ did what, son?""
I clenched my jaw, fighting the tremble in my throat.
""Did I‚Ä¶ did I kill her?""
Her breath caught.
Silence.
Her lips parted, but no words came out.
She stared at me‚Äîsoft, worried, tearful.
Then, she closed the Quran, placing it gently on the table.
Her hand moved to my hair, running through it like she was searching for my mother in me.
""No, Sayaf. You didn‚Äôt.""
I swallowed hard. ""If I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ then who did?""
She exhaled. ""It was an accident‚Ä¶ or at least, that‚Äôs what I was told.""
She gently pulled me to my feet.
""Come, sit. I‚Äôll get you some water.""
I barely noticed her stepping away. The room blurred. My heart pounded.
She returned, pressing a cool glass against my lips, tilting it slightly. ""Take a sip, honey.""
I obeyed.
She sat across from me.
""Sayaf‚Ä¶ your mother‚Äôs death was never your fault. The police ruled it an accident. Or‚Ä¶ maybe she did it to herself. No one really knows.""
Her voice wavered at the end.
I clenched my fists. ""I don‚Äôt understand. I did it. I know I did. So how‚Äî?""
She sighed, standing up.
She walked to the TV stand, picking up a small hand-carved statue.
It was shaped like Elephant Rock‚ÄîAlUla‚Äôs most famous landmark.
She handed it to me, smiling faintly.
""This was the last thing your mother gave me. She brought it back after her trip.""
I turned it in my hands.
The carving was smooth. Handmade.
Then‚ÄîI noticed something.
A name.
""Raad.""
It was carved into the base.
I cleared my throat. ""Who is Raad?""
My grandmother folded her hands. ""I don‚Äôt know. But she went on that trip right after she married your father.""
My body stilled.
She glanced at an old drawer, rummaging through it. ""Ah, here it is.""
She pulled out a yellowed newspaper and handed it to me.

My stomach twisted.
I turned to my grandmother. ""Did this happen when my mother was there?""
She exhaled. ""Sadly, yes. After she came back‚Ä¶ she never spoke again. I think she thought she could‚Äôve been one of them. She didn‚Äôt know she‚Äôd leave us the same way.""
The room spun around me.
My grandmother gave me a sad smile, pressing a kiss to my forehead.
""I think I should leave,"" I murmured. ""Don‚Äôt worry, Grandma. I‚Äôll visit more.""
Before she could answer, I walked out.
My hands were still gripping the statue.
And in my chest, something shifted.",2,1740796453.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1j0p6y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1j0p6y6/if_i_sent_this_i_would_be_with_him_again/,If I sent this I would be with him again.,"Our love felt so perfect and right. Everything in me wishes that the things surrounding it were different. 

I reflect back and I realize how deep that connection went. How much I grew. How much I trusted you and you trusted me. And it broke my heart to throw it away.

I did it over text because I couldn't bear to look you in the face to do it. 

You made me feel safe, confident, strong, adventurous. You saw me as an equal. You valued me and my opinions. You cared deeply for me and took care of me. There wasn't a day I didn't know I was loved by you. Even the days we didn't interact much.

You are an amazing lover. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it all week. 

I went on a date with a 26 year old guy in the big city when I visited for my interviews. I met him at a church up there. He was plucky enough to invite me to coffee after the service. 

But it was sad. No connection. No spark. I couldn't help comparing, and in fact I had a feeling nothing would come of it anyway.

No one comes close to you, my love.

I'm not saying we should be together. But I want you to know that breaking up with you was no small or easy or trivial thing in my eyes. It was just so necessary. I was falling apart. I was breaking down. I'm still dealing with the repercussions. 

But that doesn't mean you won't still hold a special place deep in my heart for a very long time. 

Thank you for encouraging my dreams. Thank you for motivating me to go to grad school. I got in because of you.

I remember one time I finally had to send a text about it because I had a chapstick on a dresser in the living room and she moved it to the corner of the coffee table as a sign to take it to my room. It‚Äôs SO frustrating because she has lived here longer/before, 90% of the apartment is her stuff, I don‚Äôt mind most of it because it‚Äôs less moving out I‚Äôd have to do later, but when I have SUCH a small amount of space compared to her and we are paying the same price to some random landlord she is not associated to, its frustrating that I can‚Äôt leave a damn chapstick out. She does this constantly , and what‚Äôs making me write this is I just came home and she unloaded the dishwasher full of my dishes completely and put them all on the counter for me to put away, and I look in the dishwasher- SHE DIDNT EVEN PUT ANYTHING ELSE IN! Like girl I was at work sorry they finished before I got home!

She also automatically assumes she is invited to all of my friends plans (she used to be coworkers with one of my friends in highschool), but if I come home and she has a friend over she just pretends like I don‚Äôt exist. (Which I honestly don‚Äôt mind cuz I hate small talk but it‚Äôs just the double standard.) There was one time I told her specifically that she wasn‚Äôt invited (cuz we were pregaming at our place) because it was my friends birthday and he wanted to keep it small, and was really nice and explained it all in a text, and when I came home she was talking about what we were doing that night and I had to be like umm you misinterpreted my text.

Not only that‚Ä¶. But she makes me friends uncomfortable. She has no filter particularly when it comes to relationships/53xual stuff and crosses the line all the time. Honestly to me as well, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

This one is a personal problem I know, but I am an avid Limoncello La Croix Drinker. I have like 5 a day. I know I have an individuality complex and I am working on it, but she all of a sudden started drinking them too. I even asked her, ‚Äúhave you ever tried literally any other flavor?‚Äù And she said no. I also made a cross out of one of the boxes for wall decor lol AND SHE ASKED ME TO MAKE HER ONE! It‚Äôs like girl first of all, ???? Second of all, it‚Äôs literally cutting a t out of the box. I‚Äôve also been using a VERY specific colored and style of bag for my backpack/everywhere bag for as long as I‚Äôve lived here, and just last week she bought the same one. What‚Äôs honestly most annoying about that is she left it out (would kill me if I did that) and I keep going to grab it thinking it‚Äôs mine.

She also just will ask for advice and I give it to her and then she will tell me I‚Äôm wrong then a few days later come to that conclusion herself. Most recently, she was sick and I told her I have emergen-c if she wanted any. She said that is pointless, and today she had some crazy juice and I asked what it was and she said it was some vitamin c drink to help her. I said ‚Äúhmm, that‚Äôs why I told you I had emergen-c the other day.‚Äù And then she was like ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll have to look into it then.‚Äù

I honestly just don‚Äôt know what to do/say because I know a lot of it is me being un rationally upset, but I seriously just keep getting so frustrated and I feel like she is just on some high horse. I would love any help on what I should actually communicate to her/maybe how

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j0p21d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1j0p21d/weight_loss_without_fad_diets/,Weight Loss Without Fad Diets,"I search a lot and refer to websites, institutes, and research centers specialized in this field so that I can convey to you the real information, okay?

most of us have tried some kind of fad diet at some point. The ones that promise quick results but leave you feeling miserable and constantly hungry. And sure, maybe you lost a few pounds, but did the weight stay off once you went back to eating normally? Probably not. That‚Äôs because fad diets don‚Äôt work long-term.

So, what actually works? A sustainable lifestyle that includes real food, movement, and healthy habits. I came across some solid advice on WebMD website and wanted to share it in a way that makes it easier to follow. Let‚Äôs break it down.

# Ditch the Fads, Focus on Balance

Your body needs a mix of protein, healthy fats, and carbs to function at its best. Cutting out entire food groups (like carbs or fats) might show results fast, but it‚Äôs not sustainable and can actually harm your health. Instead, aim for a balanced diet that includes:

Lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu, eggs) ,Complex carbs (whole grains, quinoa, brown rice), Healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil), Lots of veggies and fruits for fiber and vitamins

# Portion Control is the Game-Changer

We‚Äôve all been guilty of eating way more than we actually need, thanks to oversized portions at restaurants and at home. Here‚Äôs a simple way to visualize proper portions:

Fruit: About the size of your fist, Cheese: The size of your thumb, Meat/Fish: The size of your palm, Nuts: A small handful

Tips to eat less without feeling deprived:

* Use smaller plates to trick your brain into feeling satisfied.
* Pre-portion snacks into small bags instead of eating straight from the container.
* Share meals when eating out, or take half home for later.
* Order kids' meals at fast-food places to avoid oversized portions.

# Healthy Habits That Actually Work

Instead of following the latest crash diet, build habits that will help you lose weight and keep it off:

Eat a variety of foods ‚Äì Include lean protein, fiber-rich veggies, and ‚Äúgood‚Äù fats to stay full longer.

Avoid bad fats ‚Äì Cut back on saturated and trans fats found in fried foods and processed snacks.

Load up on veggies & fruits ‚Äì Aim for 2-3 cups of veggies and 1.5-2 servings of fruit daily.

Move your body ‚Äì Aim for at least 150 minutes of exercise per week (brisk walks, workouts, or even dancing in your living room).

Ditch the junk ‚Äì Clear out high-calorie, high-sugar snacks and replace them with healthy options like nuts, yogurt, and fresh fruit.

Eat smaller, frequent meals ‚Äì Having 5-6 mini-meals a day helps control hunger and keeps energy levels stable.

Fill up on the right foods ‚Äì Load your plate with veggies, lean proteins, and fiber-rich foods before reaching for carbs and sweets.

Snack smart ‚Äì Berries (like blueberries and raspberries) are low-calorie, high-fiber, and packed with antioxidants.

Avoid empty calories ‚Äì Skip sugary sodas, fruit juices, and processed sweets. Go for water, herbal tea, or black coffee instead.

Weight loss isn‚Äôt about depriving yourself‚Äîit‚Äôs about building better habits that last. If you need guidance, talk to a doctor or a registered dietitian to find a plan that fits your needs. And don‚Äôt do it alone. Having a support system‚Äîfriends, family, or co-workers‚Äîmakes the journey easier and more fun.

Remember, this isn‚Äôt about quick fixes‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a healthier, happier you.

Today I began trying to dial in [this coffee](https://valor.coffee/shop/freethrow) from a local roaster (was roasted Feb. 12th). The d40+ has grind sizes from like 0-8 with their recommendation being 0.5-2.5 for espresso. For my first attempt, I ran a cycle with the portafilter empty with the double shot option. Initially I was a bit concerned because when I went to remove the portafilter it was completely full of water and drained out once removed. However, I read up that that is potentially supposed to happen since there's no solenoid in the regular Bambino, or something like that. For grinding, I cut the difference of the 0.5 - 2.5 and went for 1.5 as my initial grind size and I used a 17.5 gram dose of beans. When I went to pull the espresso, literally nothing came out. Over 45 seconds for about a single drop of liquid. This made me think - ""okay too fine, grind courser."" and the same thing happened 'til i hit about 5.5 on the grinder, which is WAY outside what seemed to be reasonable, yet it was the only way I could get a reasonable amount of liquid to get produced. Even at this super course grind size, it still was not getting me a \~1:2 ratio out. All the way up at like 7ish on the grinder, where the grounds felt almost like gravel at that point, was I getting \~35g in about 26 seconds.

I am not really sure what is going wrong. It could be the machine, but I feel like it's more likely user error.

# [1.1] Lost and Fond

It all started with the simple suggestion to ‚Äòturn it off and back on again.‚Äô These words were uttered with the kind of reckless optimism that only exists moments before catastrophe.

\---

    Out of the night that covers me, 
      Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
        I thank whatever gods may be
          For my unconquerable soul. 

Floating in the void somewhere, or nowhere in particular, there is a ship. One built on a fallacious notion, an attempt to control something that was not understood. The people that built this ship called it Invictus, a name which as you will learn, is steeped in irony that is completely lost on it's creators.

The ship itself was an exercise in weighing ego over humility: a sleek, entirely metallic exterior that was overengineered in all the wrong places. This attention to all of the hopelessly ill-chosen details included a viewing deck with gold-plated railings, allowing the single passenger to flaunt the ship‚Äôs luxury while travelling into the unknown. To their credit, the Invictus was an incredibly¬†*shiny*¬†ship. Whoever said you can't polish a turd clearly never met the people in charge of detailing this particular vessel. Or perhaps they simply never heard the phrase before.

    In the fell clutch of circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
        Under the bludgeonings of chance 
          My head is bloody, but unbowed.

A ‚Äòwormhole‚Äô is an unusual name for a fracture in the universe that leads nowhere, as if the language itself was trying to impose meaning where none existed. The concept implies movement, an exit, a destination. Things that comfort those who refuse to accept that some doors do not simply open, and not all thresholds are meant to be crossed. The void doesn't invite exploration, but in their relentless pursuit of control they mistook the emptiness before them as an undiscovered frontier rather than what it truly was: a vast, silent indifference to their existence. Faced with a fundamental truth of the nature of their reality, their response was to hurl their self-importance and aspirations directly into the abyss.

    Beyond this place of wrath and tears
      Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
        And yet the menace of the years 
          Finds and shall find me unafraid.

One might be surprised to learn that thousands eagerly volunteered to venture through the fracture, as if stepping into an unknown anomaly in space and time was an act of bravery. While the identity of who¬†*exactly*¬†the primary individual to step through the fracture was not known at the time, someone was chosen to be the ‚Äòfirst‚Äô.

She was different, not that that was actually noticed by the recruiters, but she didn't see herself as marking her name in history by chasing a legacy. She had no delusions of heroism, and no need for grandeur. What she carried was something much rarer‚Äîthe kind of purpose and certainty that only the doomed have. She was not na√Øve, and she did not rely of faith in systems that had already failed her. She held the stubborn belief that if humanity was to fall, it should at least fall forward.

She had laughed at the name when she first heard it, at the irony of it all.¬†*Invictus.*¬†Perhaps not because it embodied the unconquerable human spirit, but because it was a monument to the very thing they refused to accept. Over time, she seemed to find comfort in the sheer audacity of their attempt to conquer the unconquerable itself.

    It matters not how strait the gate, 
      How charged with punishments the scroll, 
        I am the master of my fate,
          I am the captain of my soul
    .

Her name was Amara, and she was now dead.

# [2.1] Below Notice

The system was designed in such a way that if it were to fail ‚Äòsafely,' no one would be made aware. And it did fail.

\---

Life, in its most stubborn forms, can defy reason. It can thrive under crushing pressure, extreme temperatures, and immense radiation. It clings to vents spewing superheated water, rich in minerals and laced with toxic gases‚Äîplaces where human understanding of biological persistence begins to falter. Scientists have named these organisms 'extremophiles'; but on a cosmic scale, they are statistically unimpressive.

Humans couldn‚Äôt help themselves, unable to resist poking these organisms with a proverbial stick, not out of curiosity but to see if they could use them for something. They set to work collecting, dissecting, modifying, and cataloging. Could they survive even harsher conditions? Could they be engineered into something useful? Could they, perhaps, make someone very rich? These were the important questions.

At approximately 75¬∞S, 135¬∞W, buried beneath kilometers of Antarctic ice, a small research team was stationed at a deep-sea facility perched on the edge of a sub-glacial trench. Below, hydrothermal vents bled heat into freezing water and fed organisms that had never even seen the sun. Above, another form of life adapted, not to heat and pressure, but supply chain failures and isolation.

Among the station's daily routines, nothing felt more stable than the arrival of a shipping manifest. A precise list, delivered like clockwork, documenting exactly what was expected. Reeve scanned the usual list of provisions and equipment, his eyes skimming over them to land on something unexpected.

Provisions:

* ‚ÄòHeat-n-Eat‚Äô Meals ‚Äì 450 units (Total weight: 250 kg)
* Powdered Milk ‚Äì 10 containers (Total weight: 10 kg)
* Freeze-Dried Coffee ‚Äì 20 canisters (Total weight: 20 kg)
* Peppermints ‚Äì 6 packs (Total weight: 3 kg)

Medical Supplies:

* Antibiotics ‚Äì 20 blister packs, 20 vials (Total weight: 2.5 kg)
* NSAIDs ‚Äì 4 bulk bottles (Total weight: 2.5 kg)
* Sterile Bandages ‚Äì 40 rolls (Total weight: 3 kg)

Equipment:

* Air Filters ‚Äì 18 units (Total weight: 9 kg)
* Oxygen Canisters ‚Äì 20 units (Total weight: 60 kg)
* Reinforced Tubing ‚Äì 50 meters (Total weight: 80 kg)

Miscellaneous:

* Office Supplies - 20 pens, 10 notepads, 5 reams of paper (Total weight: 5 kg)
* Entertainment Media ‚Äì 5 encrypted drives, 10 books (Total weight: 3 kg)
* Inflatable Santa Claus (Light-Up) ‚Äì 1 unit (Total weight: 4 kg)

""One inflatable Santa Claus,"" he sputtered in confusion.

He began to sift through the delivery until he found it. Buried beneath the vacuum sealed foodstuffs was a full-size, self-inflating, light-up Santa Claus. While this could be a clerical error, or possibly a prank from the supply depot to send Christmas decorations in March, there was no immediate discernible reason for it to be included. Reeve flipped to the attached requisition form and ran his finger down the neatly itemized requests. Sure enough,¬†*someone*¬†had requested it, but there was no name attached and no indication of who thought that it was a necessary addition. He became visibly tense, clenching the clipboard a little tighter while cross referencing the manifest and requisition form. It was real. More importantly,¬†**it was here.**

Reeve was not the type of person to overlook these kinds of details. He was not the smartest person in the room by a long shot, but he was thorough: the kind of man who felt that small mistakes would cascade into big ones if you were to let them slide or go unnoticed. He knew nothing of the research that was conducted in the facility, he was there for something he deemed much more important:¬†**inventory management.**¬†Stock counts, requisitions, and organization‚Äîthese were things that made sense to him. If there was something arriving in the shipment that was detailed in both the manifest and requisition form, it should be¬†*needed.*¬†If something was not required, there had to be an explanation. He took pride in his ability to catch errors and to spot inconsistencies. That was his job, that's why he was here. Yet, against all logic, there it was. An inflatable idol of holiday-focused consumerism and seasonal obligation. Its blank, joyous expression a hollow sentiment to its own existence.

He rubbed his fingers across his brow forcefully and flipped back from the requisition form to the manifest. Reeve had a process: verify, double-check, move on. The Santa Claus was accounted for after all. Meticulously he verified that everything had arrived as expected. His eyes passed between the shipment and the manifest, checking off each item as he confirmed it. Once he had reviewed everything, he froze. The clipboard shifted slightly in his grip. He flipped back to the requisition form, referencing his own entries in the margin of the manifest and ran his finger slowly down the list and stopped.

Requisition:

* Requested: Freeze-Dried Coffee ‚Äì 20 canisters (Total weight: 20 kg)

Manifest:

* Received: \[ \_ \]

His eyes lingered on the blank space next to the entry‚Äîa blank space where confirmation should have been. He sprung for the received crates of goods, passing through everything with a refined efficiency.¬†**No coffee.**¬†Reeve pressed his thumb hard against the clipboard, staring at the empty space on the manifest.¬†*No notation. No backorder. No explanation.*

The Keystone shipments were perfect for a long time, no missing items. Then, small inconsistencies were starting to become much more common. First small amounts of lab supplies were not there, then a few boxes of sterile gloves never showed up. Now, 20 kg of coffee seemingly just failed to exist.

He closed the shipment crate and straightened his posture and was no longer curling over in unfettered frustration. He glanced towards the entrance to the station's common area as though he could see through the reinforced walls to the coffee maker. He then shifted his gaze to the mug on his desk, a constant companion in his life.¬†**Tomorrow, it would be empty.**

Reeve tightened his grip even further on his clipboard, his knuckles whitening before releasing slightly, a sense of focus and concern took over his face.

""It may as well have been the oxygen tanks.""

\*\*\*

""No. I'm telling you, we didn't receive it! I didn't lose an entire months worth of coffee at the bottom of the ocean!""

{SYSTEM RESPONSE} ""THE DELIVERY HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

""And what happens if something¬†*didn't*¬†arrive?""

""ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

""Yes I‚Äî"" Reeve clawed his hand down his face, grasping at his cheeks and eyelids. ""On arrival there was something missing from the shipment, the shipment itself¬†*arrived*, not all of the provisions did.""

""THERE ARE NO DISCREPANCIES IN THE SHIPMENT RECORDS. IF YOU BELIEVE AN ITEM IS MISSING, PLEASE VERIFY THE RECEIVED SUPPLIES.""

‚ÄúI did. It‚Äôs not there.""

""IF AN ITEM IS NOT PRESENT, IT WAS NOT PART OF THE SHIPMENT MANIFEST.""

""It¬†**WAS**¬†requested and it¬†**IS**¬†part of the shipping manifest! Just check your damn records of the shipment!""

""ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

Reeve sat still for moment, rigid, tense. The words from the automated system were entirely flat and indifferent. ""Are you even keeping track of what is going missing?""

""LOCALIZED FRACTURES REMAIN WITHIN OPERATION THRESHOLDS, AND ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCO‚Äî""

Reeve interjected, ""I'll take that as a no.""

""YOUR CONCERN HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED. NO RESOLUTION IS NECESSARY. GOODBYE.""

He stood there still for a moment, frozen in disbelief. The communicator remained firmly gripped in his hand as though he hadn't decided if he was going to try again, to make them understand the gravity of the situation. His head panned towards the far wall where storage shelves lined the walls of the room. The shipments were always reliable and arrived exactly as expected. There were small discrepancies here and there‚Äîwhich were reported promptly, but nothing like this. What were a bunch of sleep deprived scientists and bio-engineers supposed to do without coffee? What was¬†*he*¬†supposed to do?

Some time ago, a Keystone team was dispatched to this facility to crack a hole in the surface of reality: a deliberate, ‚Äòreliable‚Äô shortcut. As per the protocol set in place, they performed their staged assessments, nodding at instruments they barely understood before attempting to break reality like a fumbling glass worker with a screwdriver. The problem with glass, of course, is that cracks don‚Äôt always stop where you expect them to.

The Keystone had always been vague on the details of how their system worked, but the basics were well understood: a new kind of shipping. One that bypassed borders, weather and distance itself. A modern marvel in supply chains, engineering, physics and consumerism; Keystone Direct. Packages and shipments didn't travel in space, they passed through a fracture and reappeared at a different location with the use of a targeted tethering device. In practice, it was a large electromagnetic rod shot into the fracture that attached to the retrieval node to be dragged back into existence with the same grace as hauling a tire from a lake with a fishing line.

Reeve wasn‚Äôt an inventory manager in the traditional sense, but you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to get him to describe his job as anything else. As far as he was concerned, his role was to track shipments, log the equipment, and ensure that the entire operation ran smoothly. The way the shipment arrived was irrelevant to him; and the research conducted at the facility could very well have been studying how paint dry.

He stomped over to his desk to sit and begin methodically arranging all the new paperwork. His general organization was the key to his routine, and unlike the world around him, his routine is something he could always rely on. The ice shifted around them, with massive formations melting over time and filling nearby trenches. Thermal vents boiled and volcanoes spewed into the surrounding ocean. The area they were in was not stable in the least, but until today, his routine was. Although a simple thing to most people, it was clear that the idea of no longer enjoying his morning coffee and the break in his routine was a heavy, personal loss to him.

While he remained silent, his intent was in his body language, and his thoughts written all over his face. Much like his own checklists, Reeve had begun to go through the stages of grief in the same manner he dealt with most things, even subconsciously he held to his process: verify, double-check, move on.

*DENIAL*¬†üóπ

Surely it had to be there.

Smaller items missing are forgivable, they are easy to pass off as general human error: but an entire supply cycle of coffee?

He picked up the clipboard again. If it were missing from the shipment it would have been noted. Someone would have flagged it, the system would have flagged it. If there were a straw to grasp he would be holding on for dear life.

There wasn't.

*ANGER*¬†üóπ

The clipboard came down hard against his desk, the sound echoing through the sterile air of the supply room.

How could they forget to ship it? The Keystone knew the station relied on these supplies, they weren't going to be able to put in another requisition for a month. The funding behind this project was already bleeding money at this point and didn't allow for unscheduled expenditures. No exceptions, which meant no coffee for a month.

He, along with the scientists and engineers would be at each others throats in under a week. They are already in a confined space, running on erratic sleep schedules, none of them kept regular work hours. This was essentially like taking the spark out of an engine and expecting their caffeine dependent brains to jump-start on sheer force of will.

*BARGAINING*¬†üóπ

Reeve stood quickly and started towards the common area with clear mission: to procure any stashed away coffee and take stock of the situation. It wasn't normal for his counts to be wrong but it doesn't hurt to see if someone had a stash, deliberate or forgotten.

He targeted the corner shelf where people haphazardly threw things they had opened when their minds were too preoccupied to remember where it went. Old protein bars, a half-eaten and partially crushed bag of crackers, raisins dried out so long that they could easily be mistaken for pebbles.

Finally, there was hope in the back corner of the pantry, tucked behind some nondescript bags and shining like a glint in a gold pan‚Äîa coffee tin.

Reeve reached toward it...

*DEPRESSION*¬†üóπ

...chamomile. Some disturbed individual thought it was reasonable to stuff chamomile tea into an old coffee container. It would be easy to pass this off as a misery-fueled delusion, but sure enough, there on the tin was the word 'Tisane' written in smudged marker.

His fingers drummed against the metal.

Coffee was fuel, momentum. Steeped flowers, at least this kind, were for people who welcomed things as they were during moments of quiet contemplation. They weren‚Äôt for someone staring down a month-long caffeine drought with the crushing understanding of what this truly meant: devastation.

*ACCEPTANCE*¬†‚òê

Not likely.

# [3.1] Empty Shapes

The first fracture was comparable to a hairline crack in porcelain: thin and easily missed. Once it spreads and begins to chip and break away at the surface, it becomes unavoidable. Its reality forever changed.

\---

Foster was a collector of items, favours, patents and people. If ownership was control, then it was the closest thing to certainty he had. He didn't know it yet, but this was the last day he would ever feel in control.

His penthouse, located high above a city he was not particularly attached to, served more as a display and storage for his acquisitions than a home. Rare artifacts, trinkets, and various collectibles sat in secured cases and drawers and were showcased within temperature controlled displays throughout. Despite the organization and museum-like quality of the apartment, it felt impermanent.

His assistant‚Äîan acquisition herself, stolen from a competitor who had dead-ended her in a position with no chance for growth‚Äîwas waiting at the edge of his kitchen island as he emerged from his bedroom. Tablet in hand, she kept her gaze directly on the screen.

""Morning. Your legal team needs you for final approval on a settlement offer regarding a technology patent that you filed in '78. I've sent the details to you.""

Foster waved a dismissive hand as he approached the breakfast spread laid out on the marble island. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre offering a settlement, then we can get more.‚Äù

Her expression didn‚Äôt change, but she adjusted something on her tablet.

""Your presence has been requested at a gala next week. Prestigious, they claim. An ‚Äòexclusive invitation for leading visionaries.'‚Äù

Foster smirked as he reached for his coffee, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think they‚Äôd recognize a collection when they see one.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso, an investigative journalist is requesting an interview. He‚Äôs writing about the ‚Äòhidden empire of intellectual property,‚Äô his words. Wants a comment.‚Äù

Foster let out a gentle snort. ‚ÄúFlattering.‚Äù

‚ÄúShall I decline?‚Äù

He sat in silent consideration for a moment, but clearly trailed off. His mornings would usually start with him checking his portfolio, skimming through the latest legal entanglements of his intellectual property holdings and browsing a few auction listings. He woke up when he felt like it, not because anyone dictated his schedule but because the world operated at his leisure. At precisely the moment he would have thought to call for his coffee, he saw that it had already been placed in front of him. He didn't thank her but took a long sip.

His wealth was not built on effort, but on foresight. Knowing when to take, when to hold, and when to let desperation do the heavy lifting for him. Patent litigation had been his battlefield, and he had won by ensuring no one else could even enter the fight. He owned ideas and the right to profit from them, and that was enough. Some were acquired legally, some were not. If you were to inquire you would learn that he found the distinction meaningless.

A small but insistent notification on his tablet, the patent dispute. One of thousands, but the name attached to it was new. Unfamiliar. He dismissed it with a flick but frowned slightly as he took another sip. The sheer volume of disputes, legal challenges, and settlements he engaged with daily had long since rendered any single one irrelevant. That was what his legal team was for, but this one had slipped through and landed directly in his feed instead of being caught and handled.

An anomaly. A crack in the system.

Curated news scrolled across his muted television mounted against the far wall: another auction, an estate sale in Geneva, a small gallery in Tokyo unveiling a newly discovered piece from an obscure, long-dead artist.

The assistant remained hovering at the edge of his vision, waiting.

Foster finally glanced up. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù

Her tone was carefully neutral. ‚ÄúThe journalist who‚Äôs been trying to reach your office.‚Äù

Foster blinked once, slow. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

He had no interest in talking to journalists, and he had less interest in discussing patents with journalists.

‚ÄúDecline. Block.‚Äù

She paused. ‚ÄúThey will write about you regardless.‚Äù

That was the thing about notoriety, it bred curiosity and scrutiny. A constant, buzzing noise of people trying to understand. But to Foster, people didn‚Äôt actually want to understand him, they just wanted to know where they stood in relation to his success. Why¬†*him*?

‚ÄúOf course they will.‚Äù Foster was visibly irritated. ‚ÄúFine. Have them meet me in The Vault.‚Äù

The assistant hesitated for half a second before nodding and leaving the room.

He finished off his coffee and stood up. The penthouse was vast, yet meticulously arranged, every item positioned with intent. The rooms were silent but alive: automated systems adjusted the lighting as he moved, floor-to-ceiling windows tinting in response to the angle of the morning sun. He crossed the open space of his living area, barefoot on imported stone tile, and entered what most would assume was a private study. In reality, it was 'The Vault'.

No steel door, no tumblers or combination locks. Just a temperature-controlled room filled with precisely arranged items that mattered the most to him. Items so rare or so obscure that their value was dictated solely by his ownership of them: A pen once used to sign away a fortune; a non-descript prototype, the only one of its kind; a manuscript never published, its contents erased from history except for this single surviving copy.

Foster would wait here, if the journalist was serious his assistant would arrange a car. It wouldn't be long.

\*\*\*

The handshake lasted just a little too long. Foster‚Äôs grip firm, his smile still somehow welcoming, but controlled. Intentional.

The journalist rolled their wrist once their hand was free. ‚ÄúI appreciate you making the time. It‚Äôs not every day I get a personal invitation.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like to know the shape of a conversation before I have it.‚Äù Foster motioned toward a seat with the effortless authority of a man who was used to deciding how conversations went. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm always happy to discuss innovation.‚Äù

The investigator sat, adjusting their coat. ‚ÄúWhen your assistant said ‚ÄòThe Vault‚Äô, I expected something...different.‚Äù

Foster smirked. ‚ÄúWhat were you picturing? Lasers?‚Äù His hand gestured his assistant to come in. ""Can I get you a drink?""

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, just not this. I suppose that's intentional.‚Äù They turned their head slightly to the assistant entering the room. ‚ÄúNo drink for me, thanks.‚Äù

""Two drinks."" Foster insisted. ‚ÄúSecurity isn‚Äôt always the priority, the best kind of vault is the one no one realizes they‚Äôre locked out of.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you decide what‚Äôs worth locking away.‚Äù

‚ÄúCuration is an art.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd ownership?‚Äù

They smiled slightly as they said it and began flipping through their notes. ‚ÄúThis is an important point to touch on later, but what I wanted to speak on is not about what you collect, but¬†*how*¬†you collect.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will have to be a little more specific.‚Äù

The journalist pulled a folder from their bag and slid it onto the table. They didn‚Äôt open it, they just let it sit there.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking at some filings,‚Äù they said casually. ‚ÄúLicensing cases. Contested patents. Public records."" They leaning in and tapped at the folder, ""When you pull at the right threads, all seem to trace back to you. Curious.‚Äù

Foster glanced at it but made no move to pick it up.

‚ÄúPatent law is complicated,‚Äù he said evenly.

‚ÄúOh, absolutely, and you‚Äôre very good at it. Seven hundred and thirty-two active patents.‚Äù They flicked through their notes further. ‚ÄúNot all for products, of course. Some of them are just concepts.‚Äù

Foster affirmed. ‚ÄúIdeas have value.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey do,‚Äù they nodded. ‚ÄúEspecially when the world moves forward and suddenly the right idea becomes indispensable. Then everyone else is left paying for something they didn‚Äôt even realize was yours.‚Äù

Foster deflected. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an investment, like any other.‚Äù

‚ÄúA lucrative one I'm sure‚Äù they said while their eyes gestured around the room.

There was a small but noticeable pause as Foster leaned back, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for something specific, I‚Äôd rather we stop dancing around it.‚Äù

The journalist studied him for a moment, then sat forward slightly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good at acquiring things,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWhat happens when something gets taken from you?‚Äù

Foster‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt shift, but his fingers stopped moving.

A beat. Two.

Then, slowly, he smiled.

‚ÄúThat depends.‚Äù His voice was smooth again, the moment folded away. ‚ÄúAre you here to rob me?‚Äù

The journalist laughed, shaking their head. ‚ÄúNo, I think someone already has.‚Äù

Foster‚Äôs expression changed, but his tone was light. ‚ÄúThat's interesting. I‚Äôd love to hear more about this right now, but unfortunately, I have a prior engagement."" He stood. ""You can leave any information with my assistant and I will have my people look into this internally. If something¬†*had*¬†gone missing, I'm quite sure I wouldn't hear it from¬†*you*¬†first.‚Äù

They stood as well. ‚ÄúAh. Of course.‚Äù

Foster gestured toward the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have my driver take you wherever you need to go. Feel free to leave your availability on your way out and we can discuss another meeting in the near future.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt move just yet. Instead, they picked up the folder, flipping it open at last. A single page sat inside.

‚ÄúBefore I go,‚Äù they said, almost as an afterthought. ‚ÄúWould you happen to know anything about this patent dispute filing?‚Äù

Foster‚Äôs gaze changed, just for a fraction of a second.

‚ÄúI'm sure you do.‚Äù The journalist smiled, closing the folder. ""I look forward to discussing these matters further at your earliest convenience. I'll leave my number.""

Foster watched them leave, the click of the door shutting behind them left the room impossibly quiet.

After guiding the investigator out, his assistant walked in the doorway. ‚ÄúWould you like me to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Foster waved a hand, cutting them off. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

He turned back toward the collection, his fingers ran along the edge of a display case as he passed. He barely looked at what was inside. He didn‚Äôt need to. He knew¬†*everything*¬†that was here.

Then, as he moved to the next case, something shifted,¬†*not in the air, but in his periphery.*¬†A flicker, like a frame missing from a reel of film.

He turned sharply.

A display shelf, it had held something. He knew the shape of it, the weight of its presence, but now there was only empty space.

Foster stood still. Slowly, deliberately, he stepped forward, as if proximity might force reality to correct itself.

Nothing.

His expression didn‚Äôt change.

His assistant cleared their throat. ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù

Foster didn‚Äôt look away. He was still staring at the absence in his display.

‚ÄúPull the security logs.‚Äù

I just had the most gay panic-inducing moment of my life, and I needed to share it with people who‚Äôll understand.

I work as a physician but I dont feel like im super stressed at work. I was taking ADHD meds but recently stopped to see if that changes my HRV, which is hasnt. I do feel more calm generally on ADHD meds anyways. I am definetely an overthinker and generally on the anxious side and have multiple things on my mind but I cant convince myself that its the solo driver for the low HRV.

While we were hanging out, same date, and I was to go out of town for 2 weeks after this, she saw a text from some old fling, whom I had no intentions of messing with. During my vacation I am calling and texting her the whole time and it is reciprocal. It was also my birthday lol. I get her gifts as I‚Äôm head over heels out chemistry was great. Come back to town and I go to her place I believe the first day. She is letting me use her phone for something and I stumble upon the fact that she hooked up with the guy she had told me she was talking to while I was out of town. She told me she didn‚Äôt see the issue as she warned me and also so I was talking to other people. Sorry this will get long. Anyway I am completely heartbroken, I admit I‚Äôm stupid. But anyway, I leave and I‚Äôm an alcoholic so I get some drinks. We talk about it and she assures me she is done and will tell him that she is seeing someone. I can verify this did happen. Now is where I become this AH. I had all intentions of being faithful and loving this woman but in prior relationships I had been with women who didn‚Äôt care I was a player and let me sleep around. When I found out about my new girls hookups I decided that I would just talk to whom ever I want and hook up, despite continually wanting to see this new girl, I loved her personality so much she was like no one I ever met. We dated for about a year, I was cheating the whole time with many women, and upon her finding out and us breaking up for other reasons around January she met a guy who asked for her number. Around November before that I believe she was made aware of my reckless cheating. I became addicted to hard drugs, stimulants and ghosted her for about the whole Christmas week, at a mother woman‚Äôs house, my other ex, I come back to talk to her and find out she gave some guy her number and kissed him, but she misses me and wanted to work things out, we meet a couple times and argue and I go on another bender. I don‚Äôt talk to her till about march, except for some texts where she wanted to reunite to which I very rudely responded out of ego due to her having a new man. They get together however she calls me daily at a certain point around march and eventually we decide to meet for coffee, and apparently her new man is cool with this. We go out and are both broke but have a great time with some flirting. We go on one more date and there is touching and definite boundaries crossing even though she ‚Äúloves‚Äù this new man. Next time we meet, it‚Äôs after I get into an issue with an old lover and she injures me, I tell my ex whom I love, the one this whom article is about, and she tells me to go to her place, that she is calling a uber there from her new man‚Äôs. She has also informed me recently that they had not had sex in a couple weeks. Anyway I arrive there and she cares for me and I offer her a massage and thus the cheating begins. We are having sex constantly, while she led this man on for weeks. I eventually during an argument acquired his number and informed him to which she was very upset. Her and I got into an argument which ended in me going to jail for a month for a trespass. Fast forward to after I get out she had been talking to other men online but I find out she is about 3 months pregnant. I very much believe it was mine. A lot of pressing and the timeline of the pregnancy added up to when we were together all of the time, being intimate.We were together for about 3 month after she left his other man .Everyday. But anyway I get out and help her with a lot of stuff, moving,school etc. but I am still cheating as I was a fool, and could not stop hooking up with my one ex. The same one that injured me. My new gf continues to find this out about 4 times, and we break up on and off. Fast forward this last Christmas Eve we were still together but I was heavily cheating, and using, and she knew it and just wanted to be friends and hang out because she loved me. But come to find out she went on a date with a guy on Christmas Eve when she told me she didn‚Äôt wanna see me and I spiraled completely, using and blowing up her line. Her and I have seen each other and basically hooked about 3 times since then, her new man is oblivious. However I am very torn. I very very much love this woman and very much desire to make things right. However we are no contact and she is not talking to me at the moment. If anyone has read this thank you so much, I know I‚Äôm super stupid. I will take and listen to any advice. Thank you.",1,1740794987.0,GuyCry,7,0.67,False

As you all know, the pain is life-changingly intense. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to prevent another one.

Here's the trouble: not to toot my own horn, but my diet is already obnoxiously good. I don't drink alcohol - in fact, I've only had water and black coffee my entire life. I'm genuinely not kidding. My mom is a soda addict and the thought of soft drinks has always made me nauseous because of it. I eat virtually no processed sugars or processed meats either and haven't for years - my diet has been pretty restrictive to no meat, eggs, or dairy due to other health issues (Crohn's, if you're curious). I'm not overweight - in fact, I'm in some of the best physical shape of my life. I work out most days, depending on my work schedule, and I stay very hydrated because of it. When I told people who know me that I have gout, the response I got was mostly ""You?! Really?!""

Here's the other trouble: gout runs in my family. My dad has it, his dad had it, and all the way to the family tree as far as anyone can remember. When I was younger I took 23andMe back when they could give you medical genetic information, and it said I was virtually guaranteed to get gout.

So is there anything else I can do besides wait for a second attack to qualify for allopurinol? I'm just feeling really hopeless and desperate. I do NOT want to experience this ever, ever again.",6,1740794589.0,gout,8,1.0,False

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!

1j0o1pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elisp/comments/1j0o1pk/prototyping_treesitter_movement_editing/,Prototyping Treesitter Movement & Editing,"Made some cool tree sitter stuff while having the morning coffee.  I'm making a minimal set of movement / editing commands.  I want to get all my editing done with 12 super easy bindings for the most part.  I do in Lisp.  Tree sitter is bringing that to Rust for me.  Was never a fan of combobulate.

This is my movement command set right now:

- Forward / backward expr
- Forward / backward up
- Forward / backward knight (down and forward / backward expr)
- Forward / backward tunnel (up and knight)
- More / Less recent mark... raw concept

I use avy or swiper etc to express any other kind of movement pattern.  I still have finer grained neanderthal commands on `C-*` bindings for quick edge cases on broken code.

For editing, I'm still thinking, but the obvious stuff:

- `set-mark`
- `yank`
- `kill-region`
- `kill-ring-save`
- `yank-kill-ring`

My `DEL` bindings do a lot of work for various flavors of killing.

- `DEL` `backward-delete-char`
- `C-DEL` `backward-kill-word`
- `M-DEL` `backward-kill-symbol`

I have Lispy style semi-modal things working.  On structural positions, `DEL` is `backward-kill-expr`.  Since this is semi-modal, I have no explicit binding for it.

I don't yet understand some of the new built-in commands.  Seems I'm supposed to define some variables, but I think I will need some groupings.  I can't stand it when I'm having to explicitly navigate over delimiters like "","" as if they are independent expressions.

Since I use Leptos, I probably need an extra parser for within strings.  Not yet sure how that works, but I will switch the command behavior based on the local parser.  Ask questions and stuff and maybe I'll learn something!",1,1740792825.0,elisp,0,1.0,False

1j0nrqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1j0nrqd/palpitations_for_over_a_week/,Palpitations for over a week,"M-34

Just under 2 weeks ago I was at my uncle‚Äôs birthday party. Had alot of champagne, cake, and pizza to top it off. The next day I I felt palpitations from sun up to sun down. For the next 2-3 days it was the same story. By the 4-5th day I noticed it started to slow down, but I still felt an abnormal amount of them. I went to a local urgent care who ran an EKG but said everything was normal. Did a blood test and thyroid is also normal. My Bp was definitely high (154/90) My resting Hr when I wake up is right around 60. Goes between 80-90 during the day. Local urgent care seems to think sinus tachycardia but I‚Äôm surprised by that with a normal heart rate.

It has now been almost 2 weeks. Over the last couple of days I‚Äôve noticed from the morning until I go to the gym in the late afternoon I don‚Äôt really feel/notice them but maybe 1 or 2 here and there. Once I‚Äôm done with the gym all the way until I go to sleep I feel them again more consistently.

Went back to local urgent care yesterday and Bp was 143/90 so they have perscribed me losartan 50mg.

I have an appointment with a cardiologist at the end of the month. 

I don‚Äôt feel any shortness of breathe or chest pains other than soreness after the gym. Before this started I definitely wasn‚Äôt taking the best care of myself- 3-4 cups of coffee in the mornings and definitely not enough water throughout the day and also not the best diet. Since then I have committed to drinking at least 120oz of water (mind you my weight is 243) and staying away from all caffeine and most unhealthy sugars. Last thing I‚Äôm trying to kick is vaping (nicotine) but for those who know, that is extremely tough. 

The docs seem to be think all is good, but I know the cardiologist will know more. Just looking for some input to help put my mind at ease. I don‚Äôt deal with too much stress or anxiety, besides the first couple days when all this started.

I have not enjoyed an audio product this much since the original AirPods.,"I have been searching for buds for an upcoming marathon. I have the QC II Ultra buds but their touch sensor has a kryptonite: sweat. Any moisture gets on those buds and they go on the frizz. 

I tried a few other buds, from hooked buds with Beats and Soundcore and Jlab, to other in ears. Eventually stumbled on the open earbuds with button control and bought them planning to return them but just so I could say I tried them and they wouldn‚Äôt work for runs. 

Well I was wrong. And they are fantastic, both on the trail and off. Ran 10mi in them yesterday and they didn‚Äôt budge, and they have been on my ears most of the day today and I forget they‚Äôre there. Every other bud ive tried leaves me with ear fatigue after a while, and my drums feel tired because they just feel like they‚Äôre being bombarded after a few hours. 

With these, and the extra space and open ears, I feel like I can add music over my life, not in lieu of it. And I‚Äôm still amazed that they sound as good as they do. I feel the bass, they‚Äôre well tuned in the mids and have a good tone in the highs. In a word, they‚Äôre are a smash hit and I never want to own any kind of earbud. I didn‚Äôt know I wanted a future where I didn‚Äôt have to have shit in my ears nonstop but now I do and there is a path. 

If you haven‚Äôt, try them. Definitely recommend, even for the price. I would choose these over another pair of QC II Ultra buds in the future, and just plan on having a ANC headphone and these. These get loud enough that they‚Äôll drown out coffee shops/traffic/road noise/someone on the phone behind you if you turn it up.

1j0np4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/deloitte/comments/1j0np4c/making_my_exit_story_time/,Making my exit ü´°  (story time),"Joined this sub to hopefully uncover some dark truths in my family, and as of today‚Ä¶ as I sit in my swivel chair in my home office slightly wine drunk, I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs best that I don‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm in inner city kid who made it out and successful matriculated into corporate America. Fairly unremarkable story to most, impressive to others. Teenage parents respectively 14 & 17. Lived in very rough housing projects all across the continental U.S. Started playing sports in high school and ultimately had a college basketball career that led me to my first office job and ultimately my career in an arm of finance. 

What‚Äôs that got to do with Deloitte? Why do we care? Great questions. 

From as far back as I can remember, one of the primary guiding forces in my life was my Uncle ‚ÄúEric.‚Äù My uncle was the rock of my large family. He was the only male in the white collar world. He conducted himself with this militaristic sense of pride and discipline. He reminded me of an Uncle Phil from the tv show Fresh Prince, except he was in impeccable shape and only maybe 5‚Äô8. 

Uncle Eric sat me down as a kid and taught me about the stock market, and the S&P500. He‚Äôd make me read the dictionary and have conversation with new words. He‚Äôd teach me practical lessons about the importance of an early bedtime, properly hygiene, rigorous exercise, etc. He even bought me my first basketball in 8th grade when I was kicked out of a school. Ultimately leading me to become a basketball player. 

Uncle Eric worked in accounting for some big firm in the energy sector. His professional life was always something of a mystery to the family. We‚Äôd always see him in suits, always offer a firm handshake, he‚Äôd always tell us of these decadent meals he was having with clients and colleagues. 

Few red flags: no one ever knew where uncle Eric lived. None of Uncle Eric‚Äôs girlfriends lasted very long or he‚Äôd seldom bring them around family. Uncle Eric always parked his car ""around the block"" for the added cardio. 

As I became an adult I learned that is obvious to you all by this point in the post. My Uncle Eric is a conman. A fraud. 

I've now heard numerous stories from credible sources that he's living a lie. He's taken out bad loans in fake names. He's stolen from charitable organizations. He's been involved in bogus lawsuits, etc. 

All of this credible information coming to light in recent years, yet‚Ä¶ on the special occasions I do see Uncle Eric he's as positive and supportive as ever. Genuinely no one ive ever seen in reality or fiction has been more invested in the lives of others and has shown greater concern for advancing the lives of those around him. He will call your kid's teachers and ask about the grades, then send flowers. He'll edit your resume and remind the hiring manager he has frequent lunches with the District Lead. He'll even throw on a raggedy t-shirt and help you move boxes when the lease is up and it's time to go. 

On one such occasion (moving furniture) I was driving a rental truck full of my Aunt's crap, uncle Eric riding in the passenger seat. We dump the crap after a long day and it's time for me to return the truck and drop him home. Uncle Eric starts acting funny, he's skittish all of a sudden. But just ever so slightly. He doesn't want me to drop him off at home, he wants me to bring him to Starbucks so he can grab a coffee before heading to the office.. he works for Deloitte and has a deadline to meet. 

This was the first obvious lie i was willing to investigate. I was going to shatter the bubble for myself. I came to this subreddit hoping to encounter someone I could direct message and simple ask ""Do you see an Eric Chambers in your org charts anywhere?."" It would've proved what I already know. 

I can't do it. There's no sense in it. I know my uncle is a liar and a cheat, but hes a good man in his heart and i'll just hope he leans more on that rather than whatever desperation made him into the con artist. He seems to be in a bad spot now, hopefully meaning he's either moved on from the cons or been in too much trouble to keep it going. Either way, I don't need to trouble any of you all with this.

The obvious answer is community events. That's a tough business, but I think with some creativity it could work. There's a person in my community running paid ""speed friending"" events which I thought was a clever idea, but it's just a side hustle. 

I think what's really needed at least in my community is RECURRING events that happen weekly or biweekly, where you can see the same people week to week, meet your neighbors, etc. Something you can put on your calendar and attend when you can. Ideally based around activities, like a group walk around a park or a coffee/happy hour. 

Ideally those events would be free - which is the problem of course with this model. Monetization is tricky. You could start with free recurring events that are volunteer staffed to some extent, build a community and email list, and start doing more involved paid events? Or even have a voluntary membership model where events are free but people can opt to support the cause with a monthly membership, perhaps with some perks (Patreon-esque).

I have been chewing on this question for a while. How do you think a small business can help build genuine community?",2,1740791391.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

I am an international masters student in the US at a T50 uni. I have 2 years of FT experience and 1 year of internship experience in product companies. I have been applying to jobs(300+) relevant to my experience and knowledge with resume tailored for that domain, connecting with people on LinkedIn, scheduling coffee chats, securing referrals and yet I have received only a few calls who ghosted me after learning I am an international student even though I was 100% match for that job skill wise. Is it my resume? is the market? or am I just being unlucky?

1j0nhyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentTeaching/comments/1j0nhyo/beyond_the_classroom/,Beyond the Classroom,"This is my first ever post here and it‚Äôs long, real long actually, so bear with me.  To provide some context, I served our country as a United Marine for 20 years on active duty before I began my teaching career.  I have read many post about the challenges and struggles about the teaching profession.  First let me say, I hear you and I have seen and experienced many of the same challenges.  At the end of this year, I will have been teaching high school JROTC for 17 years.  Yes it‚Äôs difficult, yes it can be frustrating, yes you may feel restricted, yes kids can be annoying at times, yes there may be parents that aren‚Äôt engaged, yes administration may be expecting more out of you.  Yata, yata, yata‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the list can feel endless.  But what I want to share with all of you is the real impact of what it means ‚ÄúTo Teach‚Äù as I have experienced it.  The stories that follow are why I still continue to show up and do my thing.  It‚Äôs not about the curriculum, it‚Äôs about the connection.  

‚ÄúBeyond the  Classroom‚Äù

Teaching is often measured in semesters and school years, in lesson plans and report cards. But real teaching‚Äîthe kind that shapes lives‚Äîhas no final bell. It doesn‚Äôt end when the diploma is handed over or when the uniform is returned. It extends far beyond the classroom, woven into the stories, struggles, and successes of the students who pass through my door.

Over the years, I have been more than a teacher. I‚Äôve been a mentor, a guide, and at times, family. I have witnessed my students step into adulthood, not just as young men and women, but as leaders, Marines, artists, parents, and professionals. Their journeys have become part of mine, and I have had the privilege of standing beside them as they navigate life beyond high school.

I‚Äôve attended their weddings, watching them commit their lives to someone they love. I‚Äôve held their newborns, knowing that just yesterday, they were kids themselves, full of questions and potential. I‚Äôve celebrated their 21st birthdays, raising a glass to their milestones, proud of the men and women they‚Äôve become.

I‚Äôve stood in the audience, cheering them on as they perform‚Äîwhether on stage, in uniform, or in life. I‚Äôve sat in their homes at housewarming parties, grateful to see them build something of their own. I‚Äôve attended baby showers, watching them prepare to take on the greatest leadership role of all‚Äîparenthood.

I‚Äôve shared meals, coffee, and conversations too numerous to count. I‚Äôve answered calls at all hours, offered guidance in tough moments, and listened when they just needed someone who understood. I have walked with them through grief, stood beside them in celebration, and given them a place at my family‚Äôs table when they needed it.

I have promoted them in the military, honored to see them rise in the ranks and lead with the same integrity we talked about in the classroom. I have escorted them on senior night, knowing that while high school may be ending, my support for them never will.

I taught some of them how to drive a golf cart before they ever stepped behind the wheel of a car‚Äîbecause leadership isn‚Äôt just about discipline and responsibility. It‚Äôs also about trust, about giving young people the space to learn and grow in ways that don‚Äôt always fit inside a textbook.
And then there are the stories that unfold over years, sometimes over a decade, through stages of growth, change, struggle, and triumph.

One of my students, who I first met as a young high school cadet, left school and joined the military. Our mentorship continued through those early years of service, with late-night calls, long conversations, and steady guidance as she navigated the challenges of being a young Soldier.

Then she became a leader of Soldiers, and the nature of our conversations changed. She wasn‚Äôt just following anymore‚Äîshe was leading, making decisions that impacted the lives of those under her command. Our mentorship shifted, becoming one of shared experiences, of guiding her as she balanced me the weight of responsibility and leadership.

Then came another milestone‚Äîmarriage. Another phase of life, another set of challenges. We talked about commitment, about relationships, about what it meant to build a future with someone.

And then came the moment she shared something deeply personal‚Äîshe was transitioning. The young woman I had known was becoming a man. Through every question, every doubt, every moment of self-discovery, the trust we had built remained. He knew that I wasn‚Äôt just there to teach or mentor‚ÄîI was there to listen, to support, to stand beside him as he embraced who he truly was.

Years later, he made another decision‚Äîone that many wouldn‚Äôt have expected. He chose to come off hormones so that he could ovulate, have his eggs implanted in his wife, and later become a father. It was a journey of courage, of resilience, of pushing past what others might say or think to build the life he wanted.

And then came the hardest part. The overwhelming weight of life‚Äîthe struggles, the doubt, the moments where the darkness felt heavier than the light. When it felt like life might not be worth living, he reached out. Not to a hotline. Not to a stranger. To me. Because in the ten years that had passed since he walked through my classroom, he knew I would still be there.

Some of these connections have come full circle in ways I never could have imagined. One of my former students, a young woman I first met in high school, went on to become an Emmy Award-winning performer and an incredibly talented music artist. We had always shared a deep bond, and when the opportunity came to collaborate on something meaningful, we wrote a song together‚Äîone about resilience, about realizing that it‚Äôs okay to reach out for help. And then, in a moment that still feels surreal, I stood on stage and performed that song with her.

To be part of that experience‚Äîto stand beside a student who had once been in my classroom, now shining in her own right‚Äîwas a moment that captured everything I believe about teaching. The lessons we discuss, the values we instill, the challenges we overcome together‚Äîthey don‚Äôt just stay within the walls of the classroom. They become the foundation for something greater, something lasting.

Once a student, always a student. But more than that‚Äîonce a connection is made, it lasts. The lessons we discuss in class‚Äîabout leadership, responsibility, and character‚Äîare not confined to textbooks. They live on in the choices they make, in the lives they lead. And that is what teaching is truly about.

It‚Äôs about the moments beyond the classroom, the ones that can‚Äôt be measured in grades or attendance but in the impact made, the relationships built, and the lives changed.  And in the end, I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

This story was captured by a local news outlet where I reside.  It chronicles my personal connection to one of my former students that has lasted for almost 17 years now.

A real intimate connection that is more then just physical attraction and the worst part is that I had that just a few weeks ago. 

She was amazingly smart, Witt and I could open up to her. We made out so much while we studied and it all fell apart. I got lost in the ideal of how a relationship should be and in hopes and dreams and she got lost in the horrors of her own fears. What her family might think of her (very traditional values with lots of pressure from her brother's and her father), of herself keeping her feeling lock tight behind walls thiccer then the Berlin wall and in the end we realised it wasn't for us. 

I needed a break from her and cut all contact yet I still crave her, the deep talks the feeling of holding someone close to me that matters it's just such a special feeling. I miss it so much and I miss her. 

But I know it's for the better. She, man she just wasn't ready. She told me sex was something special for her and then not a sentence later that she fucked a dude a week before we met. At least she stopped seeing him, yet we didn't got intimacy at all. Only kissing and teasing and that alone I would've been so incredibly fine with but weeelll after she told me about her lover and how she fucked him just days before we met the first time... It hurts. It doesn't make sense and the worst part is that it kinda does yet it still hurts. I can't describe it it's just like my heart wants her but at the same time is repulsed by her. I need a good woman one that actually wants me for who I am and is ready for me. Fucking hell this dating shit gets more complicated by the minute and we only have so many of those in our life. 

Still I'm happy that I managed to not loose hope in love, well I did made the path to my heart longer and rougher but at least I didn't gave up on it. Just made the path resemble my desires more and to prevent me from jumping to feelings for someone that just wants to play around. 

And if she would've said that early it would've been fucking fine but we had to open our self up just to shut ourself down again it was a nightmare of beautiful moments and stress to the limits why do I always have those short and really fucking intense relationships that then end up fucking me up for months... Fucking hell I hate how much I love love and how I love the feeling of it but despite the feeling of it's ending FUCK

And the thing is I didn't wanted to break the concrete walls around her heart because I have been there, I know how fucking much work it is to get trough all the pushed down emotional baggage. It's like all that you pushed down becomes one slimy mouldy back pitch that completely covers up your core until you yourself believe you are evil and maybe even from within but fuck no it's not the case. And I know why she has those walls up and it's not my time and place to make these walls crumble because I knew if I did she would be devastated even if all things went well. It's a years worth of work and it takes time and continuously putting in the thought and effort to clear that up and I know that very well sadly. It wasn't my decision to make... Yet it still hurts like a bitch to be pushed away by the walls you knew you could easily fade away but choose to let them intact. At least for the duration of our exams.... Fucking hell that is like the cherry on top all that emotional rollercoaster was while we were having exams and they were quite important too. 

Now that was a rant. 

Well this is like all the stuff that is circling in my heart and mind at the moment. The good thing is that I feel a ton better, a week after it it was really brutal I never felt that depressed before it was crazy, luckily it was only for a day but I'm still scared by it. Now I know that depression really really can fuck someone up and that you just don't feel like doing anything at all. 

And for me after like 3 weeks +- I'm feeling better and almost myself again, still thinking about her a lot and about everything that happened, I imagine how it would be if we met up again and well I'd invite her to a coffee and chat. I can't imagine having something with her unless it's committed and that she knows that we will go in our own speed and that it's okay and that we will be a team that tackles all problems together... Sadly it was either her or me and at least I felt like she didn't wanted to resolve the issues. She just wanted someone to fuck again. God damn it all that teasing and not just sexually but also emotionally about a really long lasting commitment and connection.... Fuck 

It kinda screwed my picture of woman as if men are just tools that can be taken and used for one. I know it's false and I also know it's oversimplified and not every woman is like that but still at the moment I just feel like she used me emotionally.",1,1740790637.0,u_MrBubblepopper,0,1.0,False

I have ‚Äúbrain parts‚Äù. I know this isn‚Äôt how brain works, but it‚Äôs a term I‚Äôm used to.
Basically, I‚Äôm always (more or less) a combination of one or several brain parts. Each has a different set of memories, experiences, vibes and some others characteristics which may vary.
It‚Äôs very confusing to me, some do have a self-given names, sort of ?
Due to having different sets of memories, I have amnesia, on a daily basis. I sometimes forget my name, or what I‚Äôm doing somewhere random, or people recognize me but I cannot, making me feel forced to act as if I did. 
Sometimes, mostly for big stuff, I do know things, but I don‚Äôt remember them. Things I know are more like a fact from a book, rather than an experience I went through myself. It is hard for me to recall an event or information when asked (my theory is it‚Äôs hard/er if the brain part which experienced it isn‚Äôt active at the moment).
I also find myself in very uncomfortable situations. For example, ‚ÄúI know (but don‚Äôt remember)‚Äù experiences : I had to drink black coffee because I got it served, when I don‚Äôt like it black at all and it makes me nauseous. It can also be that suddenly, I have the grade of an exam I never took (probably did but can‚Äôt recall), and said grade is really really bad, like I never had a chance to begin with.
I‚Äôm feeling really lonely in this. I am aware there is the DID community, but neither do I want to self-diagnose, nor do I feel ‚Äùfamiliar‚Äù or ‚Äúat ease‚Äù with the terms. I don‚Äôt really want to associate with it, just to feel less lonely in this.

Does anyone here have literally anything that could enlighten me on my situation ? Does someone out there relate to this ? Or is there anyone willing to talk with me about it and / or provide some degree of approaches to try out / advice / solutions ?
