1g97yfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/monzo/comments/1g97yfd/my_account_was_closed/,MY ACCOUNT WAS CLOSED,"It’s been a while since we had a random “My account has been closed” story, that seems non believable. Here is one…

One crisp, chilly evening, the OP of the story sat in their flat, gazing out the window. The streetlights flickered as cars zoomed by, but they barely noticed. Their focus was on something far more pressing—the sudden Monzo account closure. How had it all gone so wrong?

It had been a week since the event that had set everything in motion. The day began as any other: a quick coffee, checking emails, and preparing for the day ahead. The OP had recently upgraded to a flying car—a sleek, silver hovercraft that moved like a dream and could effortlessly cut through Dundee’s traffic. The future had truly arrived, and the OP, always one for tech, embraced it.

But that day, their hunger got the best of them. While cruising through the skies, the scent of freshly cooked meat filled the air. A quick glance at the dashboard’s integrated GPS showed that their favorite kebab shop, Dundee Doner, was just a few blocks away. Without thinking, the OP redirected their car and made a sharp descent, landing smoothly in front of the small, neon-lit shop.

Inside, the aroma of sizzling doner meat, spicy sauces, and toasted naan overwhelmed their senses. They ordered their usual: a large lamb doner with garlic sauce, extra chilli, and chips on the side. After paying with their trusty Monzo card, the OP eagerly grabbed the warm, greasy parcel and dashed back to the car.

It was here that things started to spiral out of control. As they settled into the plush seat of their hovercraft and engaged the autopilot, the OP unwrapped the kebab, the soft naan and tender meat almost glowing under the cabin’s lights. Flying through the sky, a massive kebab in hand, the OP felt invincible. Their only task: drive, eat, and make sure not to spill the sauce.

What they didn’t expect was that eating while operating a flying car—even in autopilot mode—was technically illegal. As they soared over the Tay Bridge, the car began to sway slightly. Chunks of kebab meat and sauce dribbled from their hands onto the control panel, causing the autopilot to flicker and short-circuit. Without warning, the vehicle lurched to the left, sending a chilli-covered piece of lamb splattering against the windshield. The OP’s hands flailed, sending the rest of the kebab flying across the cabin.

“Warning: Manual override required,” the car’s AI stated, its calm tone contrasting with the OP’s panic. They grabbed the controls, steadying the car while wiping garlic sauce from their shirt. As they did so, they missed the automated message flashing across the dashboard, a message that would later become crucial: “Klingon Tax Filing Due – Urgent”.

The OP, being someone who always handled their affairs on time, would normally have seen this notification and dealt with it immediately. However, distracted by the chaos of the meal and the sudden malfunction of the vehicle, they dismissed it, thinking it was some error in the system.

Days passed, and the OP forgot entirely about the incident—until a letter arrived. It was from the Intergalactic Tax Bureau, a branch of the Klingon Empire. The letter was ominously worded, stating that the OP had failed to file their annual Klingon taxes. As a result, they were now facing hefty fines and legal action if they didn’t resolve the issue. They even threatened to revoke their interplanetary travel privileges.

For a brief moment, the OP chuckled. Taxes? With the Klingons? This had to be some sort of joke, right? It seemed ridiculous. But as they read further, their heart sank. As part of Earth’s new diplomatic relationship with the Klingon Empire, all residents who used certain space-based services—including flying cars, which operated using Klingon hyperdrive technology—were required to file taxes. And the OP, it seemed, had missed the deadline.

They immediately logged into their Monzo account, hoping to resolve the issue by paying the fine. To their horror, the account displayed a bright red banner at the top: Account Closed – Violation of Intergalactic Tax Code.

“What the hell?” the OP muttered, trying to process what had happened. Monzo had always been reliable, their digital wallet for all their everyday needs. It was seamless, quick, and, until now, hassle-free. How could a missed tax filing with the Klingon Empire result in the closure of their account?

They dialed Monzo customer service. After a few moments, a calm, robotic voice answered.

“Thank you for calling Monzo. How may I assist you today?”

“Uh, yeah, I’m trying to figure out why my account’s been closed.”

“One moment while I pull up your details.” A pause. Then: “It appears your account has been flagged for intergalactic tax evasion. Specifically, a missed filing with the Klingon Empire.”

“Wait, wait, wait,” the OP interrupted. “Are you telling me my account got closed because I forgot to pay Klingon taxes? That’s insane! I didn’t even know I had to!”

“Per Intergalactic Tax Regulation 14B, Earth residents utilizing Klingon technology are required to file taxes with the Empire. Failure to do so results in automatic financial penalties, which Monzo is obliged to enforce under the Interplanetary Financial Agreement of 2023.”

The OP stared at the phone in disbelief. “But…I didn’t mean to! Can’t I just pay the fine and get my account back?”

“There’s also an additional violation on your record, sir. It seems you were reported for reckless operation of a flying vehicle while consuming food.”

“What?! The kebab? I didn’t—”

“Yes, the kebab. Flying and eating is considered a distraction, and therefore, a Class 2 violation under airspace law.”

“So, let me get this straight,” the OP said, feeling the absurdity of the situation building, “my Monzo account is closed because I missed some space taxes and ate a kebab while flying my car?”

“Yes, sir. That is correct.”

For a moment, the OP wasn’t sure whether to laugh or scream. Here they were, someone who had successfully navigated decades of modern life, from the rise of smartphones to the advent of flying cars. Yet somehow, a kebab and a missed Klingon tax deadline had brought their financial world crashing down.

“What do I do now?” the OP asked, exasperated.

“Monzo recommends resolving your tax dispute with the Klingon Empire. Once the issue is cleared, you may be eligible to reapply for an account.”

The OP hung up, feeling utterly defeated. The next few days were a whirlwind of dealing with Klingon tax officers, who, while fearsome in battle, were surprisingly bureaucratic when it came to taxes. After hours of negotiations and fines, the OP finally cleared their debt.

But one thing was for certain: they would never again eat a kebab while driving their flying car, and they would definitely keep a closer eye on their intergalactic tax obligations. Life in the future was complicated enough without adding interstellar taxes to the mix.",1,1729564916.0,monzo,0,1.0,False
1g97yca,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1g97yca/so_many_health_issues_also_any_former_extreme/,"So many health issues. Also, any former (extreme) alcoholics here?","TLDR;

Young man dealing with a plethora of health issues, some directly tied to past alcoholism. Listed what I’ve been dealing with. I’m looking for others’ experiences with alcoholism effects and keto/carnivore improvements, but seeing if anybody can relate to my issues, regardless of what their experience is with alcohol.

***

Hi everyone,

Started keto on October 1st. Ideally would like to transition to carnivore. I’m 25M, 6ft 145lb with a history of pretty severe alcoholism and crippling anxiety. I went on a year and a half long bender (drinking all day every day) and ended up in the ER 2 months ago. I went in because of abdominal pain and bloating that wouldn’t go away. Severe enough to send me to the ER which is absolutely unheard of for me, but not horrific. I was worried about my pancreas, as I was having almost constant yellow liquid stools for months. Along with the pain I lost my appetite for a few days and felt a constant fullness before I went in. Haven’t drank alcohol since that ER visit…

I was a nightly drinker for a couple years before that, with only one sober stint (before my long bender). Developed vague health issues both physical and neurological which continued (and worsened) into sobriety and of course worsened during my bender. Now I’m here after wanting to do keto/carnivore for so long yet knowing I wouldn’t sustain it if I was drinking.

***

I have been dealing with the following issues:

- Daily abdominal pain/pressure, below my bottom left rib (mainly). It is never awful but my anxiety surrounding it is constant. Bloating has subsided, but my appetite isn’t high anymore. When I was in the ER I had a CT scan w/ contrast and bloodwork/enzymes done. Everything (organ scans) came back normal. Gastritis? Ulcer? Pancreatic insufficiency? I don’t know, I still think something is inflamed, stomach, pancreas, liver…my AST was slightly elevated but surprisingly only at 88. Blood glucose was at 97 which is a bit alarming to me. 

- TMJD/jaw pain, probably stemming from anxiety and tension in my neck.

- Pelvic floor dysfunction/chronic pelvic pain syndrome

- Peyronie’s Disease (fibrosis in the penis, causes pain, possible severe deformity), awful AWFUL disease but with more research is being linked to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. This falls into the same bank of fibrotic disorders such as Dupuytren’s Contracture and Ledderhose Disease.

- Floaters and afterimages in vision, loss of visual sharpness, overall neurological “strangeness” all through my body

- Dry mouth, dry eyes with spasming eyelids while my eyes are closed. Often painful.

- Persistent anxiety, sense of impending doom, “freeze” response if not fight-or-flight, rumination

- Anhedonia and fatigue, probably due to my reward center and GABA being wrecked

My diet so far has been beef (either steak or ground beef), “safe” cheeses, eggs, bacon, salami, broccoli and brussels sprouts. Coffee, some heavy cream and water. I use butter and avocado oil, and usually just salt and pepper. 

I will say that the only new issue is the stomach/abdominal pain from the drinking. The rest I have been dealing with for years. If anyone can relate or has had these issues (alcohol-induced not) that have improved with keto/carnivore, please share your experiences. I have a long road ahead of me while so young and I’m trying to stay positive. Feel like my brain is trashed, but I need to find some hope in healing my body. These last couple years have been very traumatic.

My GF and I have been happily together for over 5 years.  I even ordered the engagement ring a couple weeks ago, and plan to propose later this year. 

Story:
Last weekend I went to a workout class with a friend for a birthday. My gf wasn’t available, so I went with a group of my friend’s friends. 

Afterwards I was casually chatting with one of the instructors. We didn’t talk about anything serious. I asked if she was teaching full time, and she shared some of her professional goals (to move on from the studio she was at to pursue a doctorate), and she asked if I liked the class and how I knew the girl who’s birthday we were celebrating. There was maybe 10 minutes in total of chatting before we left. 

A couple of days later, I found her profile and saw that my birthday friend was now following the instructor, so I added her as well. She accepted my follow and I scanned through a few of her posts. She was a cool person with an interesting backstory it seemed but I left it at that. 

About a day later, she slid into my DMs with a “hi :)”. After thinking about it, I tried to move the conversation to let her down easy.  She must’ve realized because a day later she follow up with “I was going to suggest getting coffee but it looks like you have a gf?” I replied nicely and it seems as though we’ve both gone our ways. 

Aftermath:
After getting the DM from the instructor, I was honest and told my gf about what had happened. We had some long talks, and we’re mature adults so things are smooth. 

But I can’t shake the feeling in my head about this instructor. I’d never been confronted by anyone like that before, and I’m a really modest and humble person in situations like this. I’m also rational and know that I would be a moron to let go of a 5+ year relationship over a person who DM’d me and has some maybe shared interests based on the Instagram page.

Developing a crush on someone feels normal, but I’m not sure how to confront these feelings (or if I even should). ",0,1729564747.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.5,False

It was pretty convenient, the bus stop was only a few blocks from my apartment and there was a stop just a few hundred feet from my work parking lot. For context, the place had a very long driveway that curved around and almost looked like a regular road. Two stops before this, there was a very popular supermarket. At the time I had a pretty generic college girl look, short purple hair and chunky glasses. Both of these things are relevant!



There was one specific driver who had the route pretty often, and every time we pulled up to the supermarket he'd wait 5-10 minutes while just staring at me. Sometimes he'd clear his throat or announced that ""well, we're here"". But it wasn't my stop so I'd just wait it out. Usually I just listened to music the whole ride and ig bored him until he tried to get my attention. Didn't think much of it at all, just figured he was ahead of schedule or something. But still, he started getting a little more cranky with me every day.



After a few months of this, he just popped off at me. Why wouldn't I get off the bus? Why did I insist on getting off in the research park and walking up that one road? Was it him, was i not wanting him to see me go into work? Did I lie about where I live, too??? I was baffled, and told him I don't know what he's talking about. I don't work at the store, and the 'road' was a driveway that didn't let out anywhere but a parking lot.



The guy guys furious! He's saying he sees me in the store every day, don't lie to him. He can spot my purple hair and glasses from a mile away! And I'm even more confused, I've seen dozens of other girls with the exact same hair. It's a college town, purple hair was cliché at that point. We keep arguing back and forth, him that I have to be lying and me that even if I was this was fucking weird.



He starts asking why I never acknowledge him when I ring him up, and never take my headphones off on the bus. He'd been apparently trying to seek ""me"" out to chat at ""work"" because I wouldn't in the morning, and trying to chat in the morning because ""I"" was ignoring him at ""work"". Because he was talking to two different people and neither of them were interested. He was visibly in his 40s and were both in our early 20s.


I wound up calling in a complaint to the main terminal a few weeks later, because if he wasn't sulking and shouting passive aggressive jabs at me, he was telling anyone else on the bus what a mean little ice bitch I am. Which, I can be, but what did he expect trying to form an emotional connection on a bus at 6 in the morning? I'm just trying to chug coffee and put on my game face, I'm not ready to function as a people or play nice with others. It was already weird, but he made it a whole thing. And he still didn't believe me, because he'd jab ""have a nice walk, I'll see you later"" as I got off the bus. So I complained about it, I know it was awful of me but I was tired of every morning being about this weird old guy being mad at me for not working at a supermarket. After that, there was a new regular driver on my route who was really lovely!


Fast forward a few more months after the complaint, I happened to need to stop by the supermarket before I went home. Hadn't seen the guy once since I'd complained so i hadnt thought about him much. By that point I'd found a shortcut in the fence so I didn't have to ride the bus all the way around to get there.) As I get rung up, I realized who was doing so. A very cute young girl, with purple hair and chunky glasses! Here's the wild part, we looked nothing alike!! Her hair was a completely different cut, we had different shades of purple, her glasses were black while mine were purple, she was thin and petite while I'm curvy and jiggly, she had freckles, and I was a good few inches taller. 


We made eye contact and after a few seconds she just asks ""do you ride the bus?""


I said yes and we just stared for a few more seconds. I said I was so fucking sorry and she just shoves my bag at me and tells me it wasn't my fault. We never spoke again. I have no idea what happened to the creepy bus driver or if he continued harassing the girl after my complaint. But still, sometimes I still wonder what the fuck all that was!",25,1729563931.0,IDontWorkHereLady,3,1.0,False

I’m really sorry if you’ve seen a multitude of similar posts, but I have not seen any quite relevant to my timeline. 

(24F) I’m planning my first solo trip abroad from the US this winter, in between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Because of airfare prices, I’m flying into Barcelona and out of Lisbon. I will have 17 days (including my arrival day;  taking a red eye, so perhaps that should be 16.5). 

 I originally wanted to focus on just Andalusia but I could not pass up the ticket to Barcelona that was available. Technically I visited Barcelona and Madrid when I was a child, so although that doesn’t really count, I don’t have that mental duty of “checking it off” my list,  if that makes sense.

Like most people visiting Spain probably, I mainly value food, any kind of drinks (wine, sherry, cocktails, etc.), art, live music, coffee, sweets, markets, architecture, and fashion.  

I haven’t seen people posting about visiting in the winter and in the timeframe I am looking at. I will probably post again once I make more plans, but for now, could anyone let me know how this looks as a rough overview of an itinerary? 

I want to spend more time in Spain than Portugal on this trip because I have always loved the culture, speak a bit of Spanish, and it has my favorite food in the whole world. 

I was thinking about spending one night in Faro to break up the long bus ride in between Seville and Lisbon. Does that seem like a good idea? Will I regret not spending another night there?



* 2.5 days in Barcelona (.5 because of arrival day into Barcelona on day 1)
* 1 day train from Barcelona to Granada
* 3.5 days in Granada
   * Train from Granada to Seville in between here
* 4.5 days in Seville 
   * Bus from Seville to Faro to break up ride in between Seville and Lisbon  
* \~ 1 day in Faro 
   * Bus from Faro to Lisbon 
* 3 days in Lisbon 



I will only be taking public transit or walking - no rental cars. I don’t plan on fully booking everything way in advance, but maybe the train and bus as well as hostels on each end. 

I had originally really wanted to go to Cadiz and do a guided day trip to Tangier but I’ve read so many things advising against that. 

How much should I factor in the day of the week on my travels? For instance, if I follow this plan, I would be taking the long train ride from Barcelona to Granada on Saturday. (Maybe I am totally overthinking!) But is Saturday a time for fun happenings like markets or other things that I should not miss out on while on a train? Or is it more of a restful day so it would be good to use it as a travel day?

Is there anything I should keep in mind while traveling in these areas in December? I understand things will be less crowded but not fully closed down. 

This is a long shot but does anyone know if I could see a recorte / bull leaping anywhere in the winter? 

I have not fully dove into the planning of activities or places to eat, but any suggestions are always welcome!

Thank you so much to anyone who has taken the time to read this and/or provide feedback!",1,1729563784.0,GoingToSpain,0,1.0,False

Prompt 1: 

In the bustling heart of Hollywood 1946, Muse A, a charismatic and handsome rising star, finds himself trapped in a cycle of typecast roles. Known for his brooding charm and romantic leads, he yearns for a deeper, more meaningful role that will showcase his true range as an actor. Despite his success, he feels suffocated by the industry’s expectations and longs to break free from the superficiality of fame.
Enter Muse B, a gifted writer brimming with creativity and ambition, yet struggling to carve out her place in the male-dominated film industry. She works as a “paper girl” and coffee runner at the studio, a position far beneath her talents. With her scripts constantly overlooked and her ideas dismissed, she faces the dual challenges of being a woman and a person of color in a world that often marginalizes voices like hers.
Their worlds collide when Muse A stumbles upon one of Muse B’s scripts hidden in the break room. Intrigued by her unique voice and fresh perspective, he feels an immediate connection to her writing. 

Prompt 2:

In the gritty streets of 1930s New York City, Muse A is a disillusioned detective working cases that often lead him into the city's dark underbelly. Haunted by the unresolved murder of his former partner, he keeps everyone at arm's length—until he crosses paths with Muse B.

Muse B is a sultry lounge singer with a captivating voice and secrets of her own. When she approaches Muse A to help her find a missing musician—rumored to be tangled with the mob—he reluctantly agrees. As they navigate smoky jazz clubs and shadowy back alleys, their chemistry ignites amidst the danger.

Caught in a web of deception, they must confront their pasts and the growing attraction between them. But as they get closer to the truth, Muse A must decide if he can trust Muse B, or if her allure is a deadly trap. Will love flourish in the chaos, or will the city's darkness consume them both?


Prompt 3: 

During a journey, Muse A, a brave knight, protects Muse B, a spirited princess, from an unexpected attack. In the chaos, her frightened fiancé shoves the princess aside, causing the knight to be injured while saving her. The story begins with the princess visiting the knight in his tent, filled with concern and guilt. As they confront the aftermath of the attack.
(Short but you get the point)

And prompt 4:

Yes author, tell me about a geology experiment so nuanced that you have to have done it. Tell me me about how a character messed up a titration in such a specific way the author definatly witnessed or did it themselves.

Ah yes, food service knowledge you only get by working in a kitchen. 
 ‘fifo’ and fridge shelving orders, or a specific cocktail recipe and steps I can tell you’ve most certainly made it.
Or in corporate/office aus where it’s paperwork, spread sheets and forms- so specific-*chefs kiss*

Same with languages in a fic, conlangs or multi lingual characters. It’s such a human thing, the parts of you that you leave on the page intentionally or not.

I know I do the same thing when I write cafe/coffee shop/university fics. I’m sure other food service workers can tell- and I get to use knowledge about espresso and my moral judgments about coffee orders preferences to characterize and add subtext just for myself.

It’s so silly in the grand scheme of things, and research vs experience doesn’t matter as long as it’s read/written with enjoyment.

1g97ffw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1g97ffw/am_i_overreacting_for_thinking_my_homewrecking_ex/,Am I overreacting for thinking My Homewrecking EX friend/coworker is responsible for getting my hours cut?,"Two years ago I had a small tight nit friend group consisting of me (A), my ex (R), my ex's sister (L), and her best friend (S). We all applied and got jobs at a small local movie theater so we could work together and see each other all the time. This worked really well for awhile and my ex, his sister and I ended up getting an apartment together and it was genuinely a great time in my life. Unfortunately nothing good can really last and my ex and I ended up fighting a lot while we lived together. Right around that time, R got promoted to manager and he started staying at work later- makes sense, more responsibilities. When I texted another coworker about a fight he and I had, they asked if it was because of S, because apparently her and R had been getting really close at work - while he and I were dating - but I wasn't around. I set the boundary that I didn't want S in the apartment while I wasn't there, while L was on my side this didn't stop her brother from breaking up with me and kicking me out for his new fling. R had repeatedly told me he just needed time and if I gave him space he would consider coming back to me. I'll admit it was a bit naive but because of this I spent much longer than I should've in my mourning period. The rent in my area, plus my parents living out of state at the time led to me becoming homeless and living in my car, through the Florida summer with no a/c, hot humid nights with just a dying Iphone to entertain me, and no reliable access to utilities. I lost my job at the theater during this time and got a new job at a coffee shop. I decided to spend this time saving money and trying to make my life a little more livable.

Cut to over a year later, I'm still living out of my car, but I've been promoted to general manager at my coffee shop and I'm making good money despite hating my job. I ended up meeting a really nice girl (E) during this time who changed my perspective on what life should be. I no longer felt like I had to suffer alone or punish myself for things I had no control over. Though I'd climbed to the top at my coffee shop job I now wanted less hours and responsibility so I could spend more stress free time with my new girlfriend. She helped me apply at the retail job where she works, where I work evenings and she works mornings so there's no HR issues. At first I was working less hours (still \~35-40 vs \~50-60 on salary) for about the same amount of pay and life was great. Due to some stroke of bad luck S also happened to work at this particular retail job on dayshift with my girlfriend. When S found out through my girlfriend that I'd gotten a job there, she threw a tantrum to one of my gf's friends (W). W also works there and is really friendly so people go to him for drama and personal issues. Once I realized she worked there I made the decision to avoid her as much as possible and only interact through pleasantries. This worked for awhile with me nodding politely and staying away from her section as much as possible until one day she decided to confront me. Up until this time I'd been informed that she was talking shit about me to other coworkers by W and those coworkers, who didn't believe that I would do such a thing. She was mis telling the above story, making it seem like she had done nothing wrong despite being the other woman. She came up to me while we were on the clock saying R had played both of us (he cheated on her too), shifting the blame off of herself. I told her I didn't accept her apology and I still largely blamed her for getting in the middle of my relationship and making me homeless despite us all being close friends. She stated that sometime after I had been kicked out, her sister found out that she had ruined her friend's (me) relationship and no longer trusted her. As a result, her sister kicked her out and S somehow found a way to blame me for this despite me not even knowing her sister. The kick here is that while when I got kicked out, I was living out of my car for a year she immediately moved in with her mother, who she apparently doesn't get along with, which was somehow also my fault. Anyways, I told her I didn't forgive her because I am still trying to recover from homelessness. I told her I refused to accept an apology where she blamed me for her less than ideal living situation after being a homewrecker and ruining my life. I told her while I don't forgive her, I'm capable of being professional at work (not hard because we work in different shifts/areas) and if she didn't bother me I wouldn't bother her. 

Cut to a few weeks later I notice my hours are being cut back significantly for seemingly no reason. I talked to some of my coworkers who had been hired at the same time and they were being scheduled regular 7hr shifts. While I was only getting 5hr shifts despite having open availability and stating I wanted close to 40hrs total. I thought it was just a coincidence that my shifts were being cut, until I learned S was working later shifts, more midday, to cover the gap between morning and evening crew. It was at this time my gf and I found out through W that, despite her 'apology' S had gone straight to HR and told them her side of the story-that I had bullied her online and ruined her living situation - and that she had been telling other coworkers around the store as well. Well, this happened to be the second time she had tried to apologize, with the first being soon after everything had occurred - over a year ago now - and was via Instagram. At the time it was still fresh in my mind and i angrily called her a ""homewrecking b\*tch"" for what she did. When I didn't accept her apology, she blocked me on everything and I just tried to forget about her. I never messaged her after that, how could I have bullied her if she had me blocked on everything? Anyways, my new clock in time now happens to be long after she has left the building so we won't interact. Unfortunately this means I never get scheduled over 25hrs even if i work 5 days a week. This has really been effecting my mental health because I had been saving to get my own place with my gf, but now I'm struggling to even survive off my paychecks. I feel like I'm overreacting but at the same time I've never truly done anything to effect her living situation and it feels like she's ruining my life for a second time. 

Am I overreacting thinking she's responsible for my hours being cut so drastically? Should I go to HR and tell them my side? I'm really at a loss for what to do. I work very hard at my job and I'd hate to lose such a good paying job in a small town. As far as I know I've done nothing else wrong to warrant them cutting \*only\* my hours and I'd like to get back to making a livable wage. 

  
TL:DR: Ex-friend is a homewrecker who made me homeless and blames me for her family hating her, and now that we work together, she is lying to HR and coworkers about the story, and my hours are being cut while no one else's are so she doesn't have to see me.

I hate crowds and I hate long lines even more. I don't want to meet new people, I don't even want to talk to new people unless I initiate. I'm not antisocial, I'm just selfish. 

When I'm on vacation, I want three things: relaxation, alcohol, and food. In that order. 

I'm not interested in any ports and I'm considering never leaving the ship to take advantage of less people on board during port days. 

I don't care about scarlet night or pretty much any other activity. But I'll bring a red outfit to avoid the interactions anyway. 

I absolutely hate buffets and I'm so pumped for the galley. I hate the idea of formal dinning on a cruise ship even more.

Crowded pools are super cringe to me, so I'm pretty excited that VV's main pool is basically nonexistent. Zero desire to hang out by the pool and play the towel game. 

I especially do not want to be around a bunch of screaming kids at a crowded pool, so that's an obvious perk of VV. 

I'm planning on getting to know the bartenders by name and starting some hair of the dog around 11am, maybe earlier with the coffee add-ins. Got the $500 bar tab with $700 total. I'm ready.

A month ago, I get a violation letter for three trips, with non-account holder rates *plus penalties.* No big deal, I think. I'll call and they'll fix this.  Apparently, asking them to rebill FasTrak is akin to requesting rectangular tires at Pep Boys. After being tossed around on the phone for hours (talking to them and FasTrak), they finally give in and say they'll ""cover"" the $5.10 and we’re done here. **Case closed.**

Except no. Two weeks later, I get a shiny new violation letter—again, non-account holder rates *plus penalties,* for the same 3 trips*.*  Sigh.  I call back, and this time, they quickly say I just owe the tolls, which I begrudgingly pay to end this madness. Fast forward to a week later, and guess what? Another letter! They’ve now concluded an administrative review I *never requested*, and my choices? Either pay the non-account holder toll rates or, I can move on to the bonus round, post the full amount *plus penalties* for a full board hearing.

Maybe the story is a bit long but I promise it has some juice to it.
So I am in a complicated situationship with my friend. I (24 M) have liked this girl for about 2 years and it’s reciprocated but life has gotten in the way. To tell you the story correctly, I need to take you back to 2019. In my country whenever we graduate high school (if enonomic situation allows it), we have a tradition of going to a “Eurotrip” which basically is traveling around Europe for about a month and visiting lots of cities. The company that arranged my trip with my friends had other groups of recently graduated highschoolers, which one of those was the group of M (that’s how I’m calling the girl I like). When it all started, my group of only guys and her group of only girls mixed and we started getting to know each other. I hit it of with one of her friend and M goes to a friend of mine. The whole trip, the whole month our groups where traveling together because the traveling company basically gave us the same dates and same hotels. 
So… the trip kept on going and M and I started to become friends but we were with different people. Between M, my friend, her friend and me brokered a deal in which both of the girls would get a room for themselves and same with my homie so that when the time arrived, we could switch rooms and everybody be with their partner. So that’s what we did, I was with her friend and she was with mine for half the trip.
Eventually, the trip ends and so does my relationship with her friend and her relationship with mine. To clarify, M and I had already become good friends and we started talking more in and after the trip. She would give me attention and because I was going through something, id blow her away. To solve this problem, my brain decided it was a good idea to re-ignite M’s passion with my friend! (wtf was I thinking). I’m a good match maker so it worked and they started going out. I actually had no problem with this in the moment, both M and my friend are really cool so I was happy. 
Time flew and our contact disappeared for a while. My friend had to leave and they ended their relationship (which was about 2 months).
Meanwhile I was getting with an ex girlfriend. M kept on going with her life and so did I. We would talk occasionally and see each other at parties. The relationship with my ex grew cold and dark, I’d adapted the attitudes of a really depressed girl which didn’t want to get out of her hole and it consumed me. We had to break up after about a year and a half and I was left in the worst spots in my life, it was so bad that I actually developed psychological ED because of my constant anxiety (the story with my ex is another one and also very hard hahaha). 
So, after the breakup I began to look for any girl that would give me attention just to feel better about my situation. I went with some girls and my ED was really getting to me because my sexual encounters were being blocked by my own brain (believe me, as a man this utterly destroys confidence and self worth).
Time happened again and a friend invited me and some friends to his house in the lake, he told us to invite some girl friends and that’s what I did. I invited M and some of our other friends in common. In this trip, we started flirting big time and it was super fun, problem there was that my anxiety got the best of me and when I had to perform, I couldn’t. 
She didn’t really care about my problem (which I didn’t believe because of my stupid brain) and kept showing up after that, I invited her and she seemed happy and comfortable with me. We tried to have s*x at a party in my house and I worked (probably because of alcohol and it wasn’t my best time hahaha) so this gave me confidence with her. In that time, I invited her over 2 more times for “movie watching time”. I did not work and this messed with me bad, I blew her off completely because she didn’t deserve a partner who couldn’t satisfy every need and I also wouldn’t talk about it because I was really messed up.
More time happened and as M and I kept going with our lives, I worked on me and got out of my hole (which took me about 2 years and a half). In the mean time she had found a boyfriend and I was using my brand new confidence to the maximum hahaha. Id still think of her and I knew she wasn’t a happy girl with her current boyfriend, nonetheless, since I couldn’t do anything about it, I went toxic mode and went back with another ex. In these interval were we both had a partner, I texted that I would take a little distance because I still thought a little of her and I wanted to be respectful with my current partner. To my surprise, she said something similar and that’s when we both knew that we could still be something.
Her relationship ended some months later and honestly I fell out of love with my partner because of some personality friction we had. 
This brings us to now that I’m single and she’s single. I invited her to go out and eat and she accepted. We still had an amazing time and great connection. Not so long later, we were going to the park to hike or run. We even had a conversation were I explained my situation of why in that time with her I wasn’t able to perform, she understood completely and with that talk, we agreed that we’d be friends with benefits because our relationships ended not so long ago and she’s really busy with her studies. I agreed and weirdly that day even though we were in my bed and I was really ready (hahahaha) nothing happend. I didn’t wanna rush so it was no big deal. Another opportunity presented itself and once again M came up with an excuse to leave. 
I started to feel weird because she’d talk to me so cute but once every while and when I invited her to a plan, she would say she can’t. There was this time that after some weeks, I convinced her to come over and just because of a message that didn’t get to her phone on time (even though it was already established that she could arrive anytime and I was happy about this), she didn’t come. I felt horrible and sent her a text of what I was feeling. I said that I felt that she regretted our decision and that it was okay if she wanted to get out of our situationship. She replied that she did not regret it and that her studies were killing her. I absolutely understand and believe this because she’s studying aerospace engineering so she said that it was not the right time for us. The idea of not seeing her felt really bad so I told her to just let me know when she can see me even if it’s very other month. 
Fast forward to last week, she sends me an invite for a coffee. I was so nervous because for sure she was going to say that this was not working and that it’s over. I arrived to the coffee shop, I saw her waiting for me and she said hi in the most friendly of ways. Our dynamic and connection was still intact, nonetheless, I had questions. We went to my car to talk since I didn’t like to talk about this stuff in a coffee shop. As we were talking she let me know that she wants us but right now it really is imposible for her. I told her it’s all right and in the meantime id find a way to pass the time. We ended up in a good conversation and we kissed passionately. I invited her for some food, me vibed for some other time. After that we kissed goodbye again and I haven’t seen her since. I honestly think she would be the right girl for me for the rest of my life and I want this to go good. Am I going the right way? Is the wait really worth it? What if I go into this relationship and sabotage it or fall out of love? This questions are in my mind and I wanted to see what the internet has to say. I’m sorry for the big post 😛
Also, I didn’t give detailed timeline but this is in a spam of about 5 years and a couple months.

He had previously invited us into his home and we enjoy a fresh cup of real home brewed coffee, and I couldn't return the favor without him risking prison time? Maybe something was lost in transaction, either way, it left a mark on me.

I truly hope the community pulls through this and hopefully I can get back soon to say HI again.

We're just back from our 2024 trip to Scotland, I thought I'd give some thoughts:

**Laphroaig**:

We booked the Wood Exploration Tour, but they needed to change it to a Museum/Warehouse only experience because of additional renovations that weren't completed in their regular silent season. That suited us just fine; we have previously done several tours at Laphroaig, and we were most interested in the Warehouse bit that we had previously done.

This new experience has a similar feel to the old Warehouse 1 experience (at least the bit in the warehouse), and was very enjoyable, although I do miss the old version.

Old version: Cheaper, you got to hand fill the bottle of your choice, each time I went they had at least one teenage+ whisky if not two, 200 or 250 ML bottle (I'm pretty sure we had both previously due to the glass shortage).

New version: More expensive, tied to a longer tour (not as good for repeating), the barrels were all between 7-8 years old, your bottle was prefilled from a sister cask of one of the barrels which was an 8 year old bourbon barrel, no hand filling, you get to label the pre-filled bottle.

The upgraded rent at Laphroaig was a 50 ML of Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength Batch 14, the regular rent is still a Laphroaig 10 50 ML. Free welcome dram for anyone coming in was from the QA Cask, still free coffee which is great!

Nothing interesting in the shop. At the bar, they had a 17 year old that had been finished in Fino that was the best thing I drank all day, but they were running VERY low (it sounded like they were on the last bottle and it had maybe a dram or two left after mine).

The staff is wonderful as always.

My Distillery Rating: Very Good -- not as good as last year, but still a great time.

**Lagavulin:**

We've done all the tours and tastings at Lagavulin, and honestly have always just thought they were okay, so we didn't do an experience.

My biggest note here is that they are starting to run out of room in their shop. They have all the Lagavulin 12's going back to 2021, they have all the Jazz Festivals and all the Feis Ile's -- the pricing is just not helping to sell bottles and the Distillery Exclusive Bottle is still the best bottle to buy. A bit of a spoiler if I write more from my trip: the Lagavulin Jazz Festival 2023 seems to be at all Diageo distilleries, including those not on Islay this clearly sold **terribly**. 

What I found especially funny is, they've raised the price of the Lagavulin 12 from 2021 to match the 2024 (£150) even though they haven't sold all their 2021 12 Year Old bottles. I'm not sure they understand supply and demand.

That said, they did offer a choice of the 2021 or the 2024 12 year old edition as a free dram in the shop. I went with the 2024 as it was my first try, it was good, but not as good as 2021 and prior.

Off to the bar.

Pricing has always been a bit funny at distillery bars and Lagavulin is no exception, I again found it interesting: the 2021, 2022, and 2023 12 year old editions were all £11, the 2024 cost £18 which made it more expensive than the dram I started with: the 2024 Jazz Festival which is retailing for £245 pounds in the shop.

I liked the Jazz festival a decent amount, but not £245 worth. The mix of casks definitely add multiple layers, and while I like still wine finishes, anything longer than 6 months likely would have been too much given everything else that stood out with the whisky.

I had some other drams, but nothing new. Their menu hasn't changed much, keeping a few cocktails available for those that would like.

The staff was wonderful as always, I had some good conversations in both locations.

My Distillery Rating: Very Good (largely for the bar and the nearby walk).

**Ardbeg:**

We got our lunch here which is always a good move. With the winter season starting they only have the trailer open, but they have soups, sandwiches and a few hot meals.

Ardbeg doesn't really have a welcome dram, but they always tend to give you something when you engage with them around the shop, for me this was a 21-year-old that was meant for the asian market before some cases were left with the distillery (not exactly sure why). 

We went through the standard tour here, good stuff, fun to go through where the retired still is still in place, big pours of their standard offerings, basic tour explanations but the guide was open to questions and knowledgeable.

I've been to Ardbeg several times before and they never had anything interesting in the shop (I only once bought a bottle here, the 8 for discussion before it was distributed wider). This time they had plenty, the 21 year old I mentioned, as well as a couple of single cask offerings and multiple high age statement releases -- less fortunate was the pricing for all these bottles which started high and went astrnomical. 

That said, the gentleman at the shop bar poured me a 25 ML to go dram of the Y2k, £25 which I thought to be a bargain. 

Spoiler: the Y2k is great, but of course way too pricy to buy a bottle. 

My Distillery Rating: Very Good -- having a place to get lunch is a real plus.

  
**Rating Scale:**

* Bad: We left disappointed, not likely to return
* Okay: It's fine, they do enough and I'd stop by again if I have nothing to do
* Very good: We had a good time and would be happy to add to the agenda
* Amazing: Truly special, a must-visit if able",7,1729561738.0,Scotch,0,1.0,False

So I (F30) met this guy (M46) who approached me during a concert I attended. We exchanged numbers and saw each other only once after meeting up at a coffee shop. A few months later I texted him about coming to his house as he constantly invited but I declined. 

I’ll admit I was horny and this was the only reason why I messaged him and went to his house. 

Well we hooked up and it was amazing. The next day we had breakfast and I went on my way. I texted him later that day to thank him for the night and that I wanted to continue to get to know him more. 

His response was basically “yes I want to get to know you more too but please understand I’m not looking for a relationship and I’d advise you to do your best to not fall in love or get entangled in any fantasies about love.”

I was caught off guard by his honesty and it seemed a bit arrogant. I told him I understand and don’t worry I am also not looking for a relationship. 

I worry that if I continue to see him (because the sex was amazing), I will start to fall in love or get attached in some way. Do you all think it’s worth it to continue seeing him? 

By the way he is divorced and was married 10 years. Lives in the country side on two acres alone by himself. It’s obvious he enjoys his alone time and I honestly respect it. ",2,1729561666.0,datingadvice,3,1.0,False

This race was a tune-up for my upcoming second marathon, the [Richmond marathon](https://www.richmondmarathon.org/) on November 16th. I’ve been following a modified [BAA level 2 ](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/train/leveltwo)plan while averaging 43 miles per week. I only started running again in April after a painful labral tear in my hip that had left me unable to run since January. The injury has completely reshaped my training approach. I've dropped 30 pounds, pay much more attention to nutrition, and have stuck to a consistent PT routine while incorporating additional strength work. Spinning was my primary cardio when running wasn’t an option, maxing out at 8-10 hours a week then and now averaging about 3 hours per week to supplement my running.

Trail running was essential during my recovery phase, allowing me to build volume without pain. Even now, as I’ve become comfortable on roads again, I’ve kept my training to the trails. Given the terrain coupled with the summer heat and humidity, I’ve been focusing on heart rate-based effort rather than pace for workouts, which has made setting clear race goals tough.

In August, I ran a 5K in 21:17 on a hot (89°F), hilly course (200 feet of gain). Then in September, I ran a 20:47 5K on a warm (75°F), flat course. Both were PRs, but given the conditions and my effort-based training, I wasn’t sure how this would translate to longer distances and better temperatures. If anything, I expected these times to overestimate my fitness over longer distances.

# Race

Leading up to this race, I was torn between treating it as a marathon pace workout or racing it all-out. I even posted here asking for advice—shoutout to everyone who encouraged me to race it before the mods unfortunately gave my post the boot! Turns out, it was the right call—I PR’d every distance from 5K to the half, maybe channeling a bit of Ruth Chepng'etich’s Chicago magic along the way. 

I laced up the New Balance Supercomp Fuel Cell Elite v4s for the first time, leaving my usual 1080s behind. The cool starting temp (43°F) was ideal, but the course had 930 feet of elevation gain despite 464 feet listed in the athlete guide, lots of turns, and longer climbs in the second half. I wanted to beat my previous half PR (1:42) but other than that I wasn’t really sure where to set the bar for this one. Between my fitness improvements during this build, the weather, and my first time in carbon plated shoes I decided to focus on feel rather than a specific time goal. However, before the race, I used [this calculator](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/marathon-calculator/) to determine that based on my training volume, a sub 1:34 would be a good indicator of fitness to attempt a BQ (3:25). After checking my heart rate in the first mile to make sure I wasn’t getting too carried away, I didn’t look at my watch again. This race is run at the same time as a 5 mile race that my husband was running and we managed to cross paths. It was a complete surprise and I didn't notice him running next to me until he started cheering me on. I was around 8 miles in and it was a much needed boost for the climbs ahead. As I approached the finish line, I saw the clock was still in the 1:29s and I tried to pick it up as much as I could, finishing just over 1:30—a 12-minute PR from my previous best! 

# Post-race

After the race, I caught up with my husband, we grabbed some coffee, and enjoyed some ""really thin pancakes"" (Talladega Nights, anyone?). I even got to pet two therapy dogs, which was the perfect post-race treat! For recovery, I did a light spin and some strength work. I'm so happy with this result and it has me rethinking my Richmond goals. Originally I thought a sub-3:30 BQ would be exciting even if it was far from a time that would actually gain entry. Now with Boston’s new qualifying times and this unexpected half marathon performance, sub-3:25 suddenly feels realistic. Considering Richmond’s much gentler course, perhaps I can even aim for a bit of a buffer!

I work government adjacent and I work in Nevada, so I already know that there are conservatives that I work with. Some that I interact with are more agreeable or receptive to conversation. This morning during a meeting with a larger group of people, the topic of coffee and early mornings came up and eventually Starbucks.  One of the louder guys said, I go to Dutch Brothers. It’s better but mainly because Starbucks are communists. 
I am an outspoken liberal and unapologetically so. But I try my best not to be rude about my opinions. But I couldn’t help it, so I said, oh yeah Communists with their very capitalist CEO and founder Howard Shultz?

What bothers me is that not only is it this ridiculous Faux News talking point, and doesn’t mean anything…it bothers me because I feel like it’s ok to “talk politics” as long as it’s the popular opinion in the room. (ie Biden is old, Hunters laptop, 2020 election was rigged, etc.) If I would have spoken up and said something to the room about how Hobby Lobby or Chick Fil A are fascist homophobic White Christian nationalists, I would be looked at as a crazy Librul. 
And I really wanted to go on a tangent about how denying unionizing is the most pro-capitalism thing to do and that the person that said this has no idea what communism or socialism really means but that would make me a snowflake. 

I have been trying to get ahead of misinformation and disinformation for years. Confronting untruthful memes and jokes in bad faith. These ideas spiral out of control and become “truths” which is the enemy of a democracy. 

My question is why does this bother me so much and what can I do about it? Is there a good response to someone or a group of people that just doesn’t make me sound like a whiney liberal hippie?

1g96afk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g96afk,Which living room layout looks better? (Pic 1-4 or 5-8) Advice pls,"Long story short I'm trying to turn my house from a dark man cave dungeon into something more cozy and inviting. It has come a long way (my hubs use to have brown black out curtains pinned with thumbtacks as curtains) however I still feel like I need help. Apologies this is going to be super long.

The current setup:

Currently, I have our living room set up like pics 1-4. We have the tv and large display case on the back wall (pic 2) and then our aquarium on the same wall as the front door (pic 4).

What I want to change/ideas I have:

-We both have talked about flipping the tv and aquarium and having the living room be set up like pics 5-8 (minus the tv/aquarium not moved in the pics because its HEAVY) If we put the tv on the current aquarium wall we would not mount it so high, and have it on top of the tv stand. The only thing I dislike about the ""new"" configuration is that weird void in between the couch and chair.

-I need to hide the paint swatches on the wall in pic 4 (we talked about repainting the whole house but decided against it due to cost as we'll only be living here max 2 1/2 more years) I've thought about doing an accent wall with a dark greenish color like the sample on the bottom left to hide that.

-Our big ass coffee table, I would like to sell what we loveling refer to as the ""potato cart"" (It has very heavy metal wheels!) for a smaller coffee table. In the other setup I put a small random IKEA table I found in the house as an idea, but would like something bigger since it doubles as our dining room table.

-We will be upgrading the aquarium to a larger tank and will be buying a new aquarium stand ~eventually. 

-The display case is SO dark in that corner and you can't even see my hubs model cars which is what he's displaying. I bought some rechargeable puck lights and some light colored peel and stick wallpaper to brighten up that cabinet. Also just recently added the gold knobs on it and the tv stand.

-We definitely need pictures/art on the wall I just don't want things to feel crowded. We live in a smaller mobile home and the living/ kitchen area is very open concept. All the plants I have and would have in the future would need to be super high up/ hanging because of the cats.

-I would like to get a rug soon, maybe something super light?

-I'm aware the couch is *ahem* shredded from my cats (their favorite scratching post!) on the sides and we will eventually replace it when we move however in this house it's here to stay, the chair with ottoman is slighty more brown in real life but does lean more red. It's super comfy however I would be willing to part with it if something better suited for the living room.

-My living room is much brighter during the day, this is usually the light levels I get right before nightime. The lamp I have in the corner is meh, I would like more ambient lighting. The fish tank gives off quite a bit of light and I have a tabletop aerogarden right next to the front door (not pictured) that gives off a ton of light.

-A small detail is whatever configuration, I need one window very open for my cats perch that they would murder me in my sleep for if I took it away.... pic 9. Also, the random large floor pillow is a cat bed that floats around the living room/kitchen

Overall I would say my style is warm and cozy, with a smidge of southwestern. I love warmer colors and hate the big light.

TLDR: pics 1-4 or 5-8? Pic 9 for cat tax.

I had a pet with me and it took two hours for the house to cool to 81. The door didn’t work to get into the property, so I was told to crawl into the bushes for the key. I was then directed to a drawer to fix the door myself with different batteries. I noticed that the trash can was a dingy yellow that was covered in dust, along the side of it was a dirty Libman mop. There were dead roaches in the hallway and the host was aware of the dead roaches but I was told she did not have time to take care of things due to being on a trip, this left me cleaning up dead roaches. The bathroom was not clean and the shower curtain ( which I replaced with a clean one bc I didn’t want the moldy one to touch my skin) was covered in soap scum and mold, along with the molding shower curtain. The kitchen was also dirty, especially the utensils and white oven  mitt that was covered in brown stains. The previous guest must have had broccoli bc there were pieces left in the fridge. One morning I went to get a cup of coffee and the mug was also dirty with coffee stains. The property is a duplex that shares a yard which is okay , but I def would’ve loved a heads up, when another dog would’ve been in the yard or another person was there (just for pets safety). At one point,the neighbors dog decided to come across the fence. Throughout my months stay, I would see baby roaches in corners. However, the worst was when I was leaving adult roaches began to surface(one crawled up the curtain)  a few days before my trip ended. I got a text from the property owner saying the exterminator would be there in the morning. If roaches are beginning to surface even more when the exterminator is due to come around, to me that says that the property probably has an infestation that is not being completely extinguished. In addition the front door did not work for most of the time. It worked then it didn’t (made the host aware) then it did work and didn’t again. So the mold , roach infestation and dirty utensils and one door not working( a fire hazard) are not host violations? Is this normal ? I provided Airbnb with documentation of this within the first week. 

I was forced to stay here out of obligation because it is in a rural area and is the only place that did not cost 6k per month that accepted pets. ",2,1729559794.0,airbnb_hosts,14,0.58,False

In autumn 2023 I discovered on my own that my partner of 15 years and the father of my child had been taking HRT for a few weeks. I learned he had wanted to visit a trans organisation, it was closed, a trans woman happened to pass by and told him over coffee he was either trans or would k\*\* himself and she ended up giving him some of her hormones. Quite the start - right ? We talked - he identified as non-binary, I told him he was my person, neither of us knew what would happen but we we determined to work throught it because we loved each other deeply. I encouraged him to talk to his psychologist, see an endocrinologist and connect with trans peers. At this point, we both knew trust had to be rebuilt.

For the next few months, I was in a fog, feeling depressed but reading stuff about how to support a trans partner, while he was enjoying exploring his feminine side - nail polish, long hair, clothes, typical stuff. He still struggled with  shame and sometimes I would caught him lying by omission. One day he casually announced he was going for a permanent hair removal appointment, another time he showed up wearing a dress at a dinner party with friends. Each time, I felt like a 'done deal'. I could see he was worried about me. He is a kind person. I couldn't find the rights words to say. I am not great at expressing my feelings. I shut down. But that didn't mean we couldn't talk about his identity. In fact, if I'm being honest, we rarely did, maybe once a month.

Last winter was awful. I caught a female friend of ours flirting with him while our kids were playing upstairs and her partner just in the next room. My stomach turned. He insisted she was the one flirting and he never reciprocated. It had been going on for a while. I later found out she was using a feminine name and pronoun for my partner. I was frustrated to have to explain how this whole thing was damaging and disrespectful to our relationship. I told him I needed trust, honesty and emotional safety in a relationship. I set boundaries for the first time in my life. I asked him to choose me, to choose us. Which he did, though somewhat reluctantly since, well you know, she is his friend and he likes her and he doesn't want to hurt her. What about me. I felt like shit.  Thinking about it makes still make me cry. I didn't know then that not saying no, leaving the door open, hiding a flirt to your partner because you know they'd be upset, it is also cheating.

Fast forward to last spring. I was feeling much better, making plans for our future. together Then, just like that, I found online photos and videos of him and our children's art teacher naked. Long story short he claimed it is just nude drawing with live models, but from what I saw (people on their knees or/and with leashes or high heels in their mouth or around their genitals), it is more than 'art'. He said he did nothing wrong and thatI never questioned him because I wasn't interested in what he was doing. How convenient.

Let's just say that day I finally chose myself, even if it meant letting him go. Breaking up was excruciating. Breaking up our family was the hardest thing I've ever done. I was so angry. I stopped talking to him except for things related to our child - we have joint custody. I moved to another city. To this day, he still refuses to take responsibility for his actions, only complaining about how I left him and made him unhappy. Transidentity is not the big 'issue' here. I wonder what happened to the kind person with whom I spent 15 loving years ? When did he become that self-centered ? How do I stop loving him ? I also identify my past toxic patterns and I see a therapist again.

I am healing by letting it go, taking care of myself. It is not easy everyday but I know I took the right decision. Self-love club guys ! Thanks for reading me.",11,1729559171.0,mypartneristrans,1,0.72,False

She sees this customer that comes in all the time and starts to get creeped out by him and then gets kidnapped on her way home one day. She wakes up and her ex is there and she’s like wtf and it think it’s explained that the rival mafia gang was gonna use her to try and catch him or something and so he kidnapped her first. Idk how it’s settled but she ends up being a maid and is getting paid by him and he’s paying for her mother’s cancer treatment. she goes to the maids room and one of them really hates her and it ends up being that he used to sleep with her. She is cleaning his apartment level cause his house was kind of weird it was sort of like a huge building and he had an entire level to himself i guess and she finds a kids room.

It may be different with your surgeons offices. However, these were the guidelines that were given to be during my pre anesthesia call. It would have been nice if I was sent these info via email or letter. So i figure my notes could be helpful to someone who wants to know what are the pre-ops of top surgery. 
-surgery time: 
check in 1.5 hours of prep + 2.5 hours of surgery + 2-3 hour recovery time = total 6.5 hours 
 
Medications: 
The Anesthesiologists will go over all your current medication list for me: 
-continue testosterone, but she did ask when i do my injections and i do it weekly fridays and my surgery date is mid-week so it maybe different for others. I heard some surgeons require us to stop T a few weeks prior and after but it is an outdated requirement. But im sure there are a few surgeons who are still old school and will strictly require you to do so.  
-multivitamin stop 1 week prior to surgery  
- if you any reason you need pain relieve before surgery or day of surgery it is ok to take Acetaminophen (Tylenol). NO Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin), Naproxen (Aleve), Aspirin 
-NO nicotine 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after top surgery (No smoking, no patches, no vaping) 
-No alcohol one week prior to surgery 
-1-2 days prior to surgery date will get reminder call with check in and surgery time 
-no shaving 2 days before surgery 
- Wash with over the counter antibacterial soap night before and the morning of surgery ( you can order from amazon any brand as long as it labeled as antibacterial soap) 
After antibacterial wash: 
-No skin products ( example body lotion, face lotion,  deodorant) 
-NO eating before 8 hours check in time. Before 8 hours of check in time eat only light meal 
------------------------------------------------ 
Day of Surgery: 
- Allowed clear liquid up to 2 hrs before ( examples of clear liquid, black coffee only (no milk no creamer etc, apple juice, tea, water)  
-Don’t bring any jewelry 
-Wear loose clothes. I found some mastectomy shirts with drain pockets. I prefer the zip up instead of buttons there are plenty of choice on amazon. You should pick 1 or 2 sizes up for the spacing of the draining seems to fit well.  
-Bring insurance card and photo id 
-If you bring anything else like phone etc will be placed in a plastic bag along with your clothes and it will be not secured however, I haven’t had any issue with previous surgery usually there is a nurse in the room with you and I never had anything to worry about. 
 
Post surgery: 
-If taking any narcotics NO driving, driving is ok whenever you are comfort in doing so 
-No heaving lifting for 6 weeks or strenuous excising. Walking is recommended. 

-Sleeping upright on a wedge pillow is recommended but not required. For me i have to sleep either at 90 degree angle or flat. I tried the other angles and it causes me discomfort with my back i do use under the knee pillow too. The 90 degree angle is the most comfort second to flat on back. So im not sure if i will end up using a wedge pillow or not.  

- Post op for drain removal is 1 week after surgery date, these are attached with safety pins

***Today’s Reading: Psalm 119:65-72***

*You are good, and what you do is good; teach me your decrees. \~Psalm 119:68*

**Good For You?**

Because I like dark chocolate, I once Googled “Is dark chocolate good for you?” I got a variety of results – some good, some bad. You can do the same for almost any food product. Is milk good for you? Is coffee good for you? Is rice good for you? There is a dizzying array of answers to these questions, so you must be aware that the search itself may not be good for you. It may give you a headache?

But if you’re looking for something that’s one hundred percent good for you all the time, can I recommend the Word of God? Listen to what it can do for the follower of Jesus who is seeking to build a relationship with God.

It can keep you pure (Psalm 119:9, 11).

It blesses you (Luke 11:28).

It makes you wise (Matthew 7:24).

It gives light and understanding (Psalm 119:130).

It helps you grow spiritually (1 Peter 2: 2).

Out God is good: “The LORD is good to all,” says Psalm 145:9. And in His goodness, He’s provided those who love Him with a guide that helps us see how to enhance our relationship with Him. as we try to decide how to live in a world full of choices, praise God that He’s told us in Scripture what’s good for us. Let’s say with the psalm writer: “How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth” (Psalm 119:103). **\~Dave Branon**

*God, thank You for leaving us Your inspired Word. Help us to read it carefully, interpret it correctly, and apply it enthusiastically in our lives.*

**God’s Word is the only sure foundation for life.**

***Bible Verse***

*Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; \~Ephesians 5:25*

Lord, I ask that You guide my path today and, more specifically, my thoughts, words, and actions. In Jesus’ Name. Amen.

*Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? \~Romans 6:3*

There are no ""third places"". These third places are supposed to be magical hangout places away from home, and away from work, where socializing just happens.

The problem with this idea is that ""third places"" were often just ordinary things we still have today, like bars, coffee shops, bowling alleys, arcades, etc. But these days (1) most people don't want to go to those places, (2) if they do go to those places, they don't want to take any initiative to meet anyone outside their established friend group.

This was becoming a problem even in the 2000s, but now it's significantly worse. Even if you provide tons of spaces where people can hang out and enjoy themselves, people today won't venture outside their bubble to meet other people. They don't want to look at their own habits, insecurities, and attitudes. They want to blame it on the environment around them.

The fact is that people today people are very often narrow-minded, intolerant, and unfriendly. They don't want to make themselves uncomfortable in any way, even to meet new people, and establish new friendships. They don't want to plan anything out, or reach out to others to go out. That's sad, but it's not the problem of a lack of third places. It's the fault of the people who are spending too much time behind screens, who lack even the most basic skills needed to take part in a social group.

When we socialized in the 1990s, we just called each other and asked if we wanted to do this or that together. Often it was pretty mundane stuff, like going to a comic book shop. Or watching a movie at one person's home. Or playing some video games. Sometimes it was something boring like me just watching my friend play a computer game. Sometimes we didn't have any plan at all. We just decided to get together to ""hang out"". That's it. We would meet up, and then figure out what we felt like doing. We were driven to it by boredom, but just spending time together was meaningful. That basic capacity to chill together is sadly lacking now.

When we have YouTube, is anyone truly bored? When we're part of a little Discord ""community"", isn't there always some basic interaction to be had? And yet it's not nearly the same. In-person friendships are the most meaningful ones, that stick with us throughout our lives. We need to learn how to take responsibility for them and cultivate them.",0,1729558470.0,self,14,0.48,False

Rain is falling. Like most mornings, I’m sitting in my home office, sipping coffee and working on code.  The city’s skyline, a familiar backdrop, is my constant companion. I think of my family, the warmth of home, and the comforts of my life in Seattle. I realize that not everyone has the same fortune. 

This thought, a familiar refrain, returns me to the news I’ve been reading: the growing trend of camping bans in Washington state.  It’s a trend that echoes what I witnessed in California, where I worked for many years.  There, I saw firsthand the impact of these laws on people struggling to survive on the streets.  I saw the pain, the desperation, the human cost of these bans.  I saw people pushed to the margins, their lives further complicated by a lack of safe places to call home.  

It’s a story that has sadly become all too familiar.  Cities like Tacoma and Lakewood, echoing California’s lead, are enacting similar bans, despite the growing chorus of voices urging them to reconsider.  Advocates and coalitions are calling these bans a human rights issue, arguing that criminalizing homelessness only pushes people further into the shadows, and doesn’t address the root causes of the problem. 

I remember working with a team at Google, brainstorming solutions to complex technical challenges.  We were a diverse group, with different backgrounds, perspectives, and skills.  But we were united in our goal: to create something better, to leave the world a little bit better than we found it.  I was proud to be part of that team, and I still hold the same belief today. 

That belief is why I write this blog.  It’s not just about code, or technology, or even the latest gadgets. It’s about understanding the human element in our world, the stories that exist outside of our comfort zones.  It’s about recognizing that our cities, our communities, are only as strong as their weakest link, and that everyone deserves a safe, secure place to call home.  

I understand that many people have different perspectives on this issue.  They may be concerned about the cost, or the impact on public safety.  These are valid concerns, and they deserve to be heard.  But it’s important to remember that we are all part of the same community, and that we have a shared responsibility to help those in need.  

In my personal journey, I’ve learned that kindness, compassion, and understanding go a long way.  I’ve seen the power of community, and I’ve witnessed the strength and resilience of the human spirit.  I believe that these qualities are essential to building a more just and equitable society.  

There are solutions to homelessness, and they require a commitment from all of us.  We need to invest in affordable housing, provide job training and support, and address the root causes of poverty and displacement.  This is not a problem that can be solved by simply pushing people around.  It requires a collective effort, a willingness to listen, and a belief in the inherent dignity of every human being.  

This isn’t just an abstract concept. It’s about the people I’ve met, the lives I’ve seen changed, the stories I’ve heard. It’s about making a difference, one person, one community at a time.

Not my preferred way of doing this, but because we got in late, it was one night in Seoul, two nights in Busan, 3 nights back in Seoul over the weekend.

**Budgeting**

Not really on a strict budget, but not going to pay crazy amounts for no reason.  Total spent here breaks down to something like this, keeping in mind there are a lot of caveats.

Hotels: $400  
Transportation:  \~$150, includes 3-day climate card, RT Seoul to Busan, Airport Limousine to ICN.  
Meals:  <$200, 2 meals a day  
Other snacks, pastries, coffees <$50

Lots of credit card use.  I had about 200,000 krw on hand and wanted to use it all and did.  

**Language**

I can read Korean, but not necessarily understand it.  I'm good with basic things and especially names of food and ordering food..  There's two important things to learn in a foreign country:  how to order food and how to ask where the bathroom is.   Korean is one of the easiest language systems to be able to read and since Korea loves to directly translate English words into Korean, I think it's worth investing a little time in learning how to read.  It doesn't even take that much time.  75% of a cafe menu is  in Koreanized-English.  Flash cards on a long haul flight would do the trick.  I'm Asian, so when I walk into a restaurant in Asia, I often get asked in the native language first, so it's good to be able to get to answer in a very broken way so it doesn't seem like I \*really\* know what I'm talking about so I don't get sucked into a full on confusing situation.

**Air Premia Flight**

Some reservations about going with Air Premia, but the sale was $700 RT from SFO to ICN on Economy Standard which includes seat selection and 2 checked bags and was only $20 RT more than Economy Lite.  After a few quick videos, didn't seem that bad so went with it.  Honest review:  I'd do it again.  I've done KAL twice and there's a few difference which I have no problem sacrificing.  Air Premia only offers coffee and water, but it's not like they limit you.  They're always coming by and you can ask for it at any time.  The meals were smaller, but enough and the food was passable by airline standards.  I've had worse meals on Japan Airlines (I'm looking at you, [weird gloopy Muji thing](https://www.ryohin-keikaku.jp/news/2023_1025_02.html) from 2023).  Entertainment system is limited to a few Korean titles with English subs and they give you headphones.  If you can live without the inflight entertainment and the soda/alcohol, Air Premia does what it needs to do.  Flight attendants are very attentive.  I think response time was 15-30 seconds from when someone hit the call button.

You don't get the ability to do the in-city check in at Seoul Station and if you're using ICN Smart Pass, that'll work at the first security check, but not at the boarding gate.

**Immigration/Customs ICN**

Landed at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night.  Had my bags and was looking for the Arex train by 8:15pm.  YMMV.  Sly tip:  When you line up into the separate lines in front of each immigration officer, pick the line closest to the Accessible/Fast Track-Diplomat line.  If no one is in line for those windows they take from the closest regular line people.  Probably saved me a whole five minutes, which still didn't get me in time for the 8:08 Express train and not a big deal in the end, but it makes me feel like I gamed the system.  There really weren't that many people in line anyway.  Got to the hotel near Seoul Station, via the all-stop, by 9:45pm.

Did not see anyone use ICN Smart Pass when leaving the country.  We skipped about 50-75 people by using it.  It just gets you through the initial security screening.  Still need your passport out for the auto-immigration clearance post-security screening.

**Seoul Hotel #1 - Hotel Manu**

Prices definitely inflated because I was booking less than a month out.  This was $143 for 2 people for one night and the only reason this hotel was chosen was because of it's proximity to Seoul Station relative to price.  Checked in at 10pm and hopped on an 8:58am train to Busan the next morning, so convenience was the deciding factor here.   Hotel is fine.  Rooms are a bit dated.  It has a weird split window, one on the ground that sticks out that would be perfect for a cat and then another cut out window that was actually nice to sit in and people watch.  6/10.  Wouldn't stay again.  Not much around.

**Train to Busan**

Opted for the KTX-Cheongryong because it was a time we were looking for.  Also got suckered into 1st class because it was only 12K more and my quick research indicated more leg room, free water and snacks.  Booked it, then figured out that all of that was for the \*other\* KTX trains and not this newer one.  Oh well, blame it on the short booking.  If you want to use the infotainment system that has Youtube you have to have a wired headset.  It was also full when it left Seoul Station.

**Busan Hotel - Lala Vianco Business Hotel in Seomyeon (Rara Bianco Business Hotel,** 라라비안코 비즈니스 호텔**)**

 It says 3-star on their website.  2-star on Google Maps.  It's a fine, small hotel.  Front desk was friendly.  Surrounding area is very quiet.  Room felt very Japanese-like, complete with the area to take your shoes off and the beds were just mattresses on a slightly elevated floor.  Does the trick though.  It did have a fancy [LG Style Smart Steam Clothing Care System](https://www.google.com/search?q=lg+clothes+steamer&oq=LG+Clothe&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBggDEEUYOTIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDE2NjdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#oshopproduct=gid:1774160787879411184,mid:576462371165298747,oid:3155071005627674919,iid:5195126235416303444,rds:UENfMTc3NDE2MDc4Nzg3OTQxMTE4NHxQUk9EX1BDXzE3NzQxNjA3ODc4Nzk0MTExODQ%3D,pvt:hg,pvo:3&oshop=apv&pvs=0).  It was $100 for 2 people for 2 nights, total.  It was clean so it was well worth the price and my jacket is so fresh and so clean.  If you want their free-flow breakfast option, it's 5,000 krw. Near transportation, lots of restaurants.

**Seoul Hotel #2** - **Nine Tree Premier Hotel Myeongdong II**

What a long name.  I typically stay at the Grand Hotel Myeongdong, but that was unavailable because of the short booking.  That hotel is in Myeongdong, right around the corner from an airport limousine bus stop and Seoul Metro stop and is just one block away from the craziness that is Myeongdong, so the front of the hotel is quiet.  This hotel, though, is fine. 5-10 minute walk to Myeongdong.  Super, super quiet during the weekends and then the neighborhood comes alive during lunch hour on the weekdays.  Lots of restaurants around.  It has a GS25 right in the lobby that had Climate Cards.  This was $576 for 2 people for 3 nights, total that included Fri/Sat/Sun night.

**Transportation**

Mostly subway.  Took a taxi from Busan hotel to Busan Station and then from Seoul Station, in the absolute pouring rain, to the Nine Tree.  Both rides were less than 10,000 krw, and saved having to carry luggage up and down the stairs and down the streets.  

**Busan Food Highlights and Thoughts**

[Baek Chef](https://naver.me/FlZmbnay) 백셰프 - Meat restaurant.  Supposedly known for their pork ribs.  Good, solid and few steps from hotel.  Full on Korean here.  Owner speaks enough food-related English.  I speak enough food-related Korean.  This is a theme.

[BoBae Banjeom ](https://map.naver.com/p/entry/place/1922277426?c=20.00,0,0,0,dh)보배반점 서면점 - Chinese-style Korean food.  Jjampong Sujebi and Rose Jjampong.  Yum.  Tablet ordering at the table with translation.  It's a chain.

[Tasty Duck Bulgogi](https://map.naver.com/p/entry/place/13044020?c=17.46,0,0,0,dh) 맛소문오리불고기 해운대본점 - This is OUT there.  At the end of the #2 Line, two stops east of Haeundae.  I've never heard of duck bulgogi.  This was very good and worth the trek.  Checking another thing off the language ordering achievement list.  You could just point to the picture on Naver, though.  I'm sure that works.

[Blu Shaak Coffee](https://map.naver.com/p/entry/place/1536304773?c=18.82,0,0,0,dh) - Yes, coffee in Korea is probably not as good as it should be considering just the sheer abundance of coffee shops but the Peanut Latte here is pretty darn good.  Also a chain.

Did the whole Gamcheon Village, Kkangtong Market, Haeundae and wandered around Seomyeon.  Busan's population skews much older which I think is evident is how slow the escalators are!  Maybe that's not the reason the escalators are so slow, but they are sooooooooo sloooooooooow.  It's all over people's itineraries and been done a thousand times before.

**Seoul Food Highlights and Thoughts**

[Woomi Jip](https://www.instagram.com/woomi_jip/?locale=en_AE%2B2) - This place has a 4.99 rating on Naver and that might just be underselling it.  This is in Hongdae, away from the main Hongdae street and honestly down a dark small street and another dark alley.  Ah Korea, one of the few places where this probably means good food and not being shivved.   This place also looks like it was someone's house.  I think it only has 7 tables?  One of the Korean blogs said there was a second floor.  They specialize in oxtail and it is oh so delicious.  The poor owner almost had a nervous breakdown when we walked in and he immediately recognized that we weren't Korean.  He said, nervously, ""English...little"", to which I replied with the name of dish we were here for, in Korean, and he relaxed a bit.  Never did relax fully at all, though.  Such a nice guy.  Ordering done via phone and QR Code.  This is on the ""definitely go back next time"" list.  No Doubt.

Majang Meat Market - I wasn't sure about this one.  I didn't know how to start or what really to look food.  Ended up walking down the market until someone called us over in English, which is something that's usually a turn off.  It was 75,000 krw for 444 grams of 1++ plus some slices of raw beef and a few slices of brisket.  The table charge was 7,000 krw per person.  I didn't do any research, so I don't know if this is high.  The meat was very good and the restaurant didn't just have tourists in there.  I would go back.

[Tzubang Donkatsu](https://map.naver.com/p/entry/place/1195804674?c=20.00,0,0,0,dh) 원조 쯔왕돈까스 - If you recognize the name of this place, this is a total fanboy pick.  Debating coming all the way here for this, but as a fan of the mukbang Youtuber, Tzuyang, I felt like I had to.  Her 1st restaurant next door, Jeongwon Bunsik or Garden Bunsik, closed down on October 5th.  This place has only a few tables and the wait on a Sunday at 11:15 was about 30 minutes.  The longest I waited for any restaurant.  Cheese-Guacamole Donkatsu, Kimchi Fried Rice and Fish Katsu were the picks here.  Didn't go for the big donkatsu because it seemed more batter than man.  First two things were pretty average, and I assure you there are better places in Seoul.  That fish katsu though.  I don't know what's going on here but that was one of, if not the best pieces of fried fish I've ever had.

[Onsuban](https://www.instagram.com/onsuban_chungmuro/?locale=en_AE%2B2) - I guess this has multiple locations?  Went to the one in Chungmuro which gives off Japanese ramen shop vibes located within, what can only be described as an old shack.  It serves beef in beef broth with noodles or rice.  Delicious.  Almost gave up on this one because the ordering seemed too confusing for my limited Korean, but that was because the kiosk had given out and needed repair and the guy taking orders was popping in and out with a makeshift line.  He had it covered though.  We figured it out.  

Our Bakery - there was a recent discussion about bakeries here and how the bakeries are not that great.  The Almond Croissant at the OUR bakery chain is so very good.  Crispy outside.  Buttery, flaky inside.  Almond paste throughout.  I tried to bring one home from the airport branch and they didn't have it in stock.  Just added to my leaving-Korea induced depression.

Oh and that dumb 4-pack salt bread from Jayeondo is so buttery delicious and good.  I wanted to hate on it.  I couldn't.  I just...couldn't.  I brought a 4-pack home with me.  I'm not even sorry about it.

Overall, I love Seoul just to wander around various neighborhoods, down different alleys, side streets. and yes, I do love walking through the craziness of Myeongdong for the energy and to see just how much the Honey Butter Almond Empire has expanded in the last 7 years.  I didn't need to ask for an English menu once.  There were some confusing moments, for sure, but we all got through and got good food and that's all that matters.    
  
Thanks for indulging me.  Must..not...sleep...yet....

So I recently have been dealing with the WORST heartburn of my life, and I was pregnant last year! 

I have been getting chest heaviness, a sore throat, heartburn, hoarseness, the whole nine yards for a month now. I have worked on cutting out many foods, particularly tomatoes that have caused upset. When I get a flare up, the burn lasts for days, sometimes longer. The acid is so brutal it causes hoarseness and this is NOT great as I am a high school choir teacher. 

My doctor prescribed 40 mg of omeprazole but I still get breakthrough reflux, going on the 3rd week at this point. Gaviscon and tums take the edge off but never fully remove the discomfort. 

I THINK this is happening because I live in SoCal and the fires in my area were triggering daily migraines. I was taking 800 mg 2x a day to keep them at bay. It wasn’t long before the GERD symptoms started and now they just won’t stop despite me not taking Motrin for over a month now. I’m miserable. 

My health anxiety has been through the roof and I’m sincerely afraid I’m stuck like this forever. I miss coffee. I miss wine. I want some damn pasta with a tomato in it. 

Any guidance would be appreciated. My health ",1,1729558147.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
