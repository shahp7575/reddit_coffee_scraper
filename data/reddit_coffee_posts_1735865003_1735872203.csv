1hsc0og,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepParalysisStories/comments/1hsc0og/my_encounter_with_my_sleep_paralysis_thing_i_call/,My encounter with my sleep paralysis thing I call Steve,"

For a bit of context as this is my first proper post about this I'd like to welcome every one to Steve who is my sleep paralysis thing yes I did name him and yes I did assume and assign him a gender...

Me and Steve have been unfortunately stuck together for years for as long as I can rember idk why or how he came or even why he's decided to stay I live a relatively boring life cozier up in bed drinking coffee and watching films so I'm assuming he gets no fun out of watching me sleep although ik he could find my sleep talking amusing sometimes....

Anyway to the point usually Steve stands about a foot away from the bottom of my bed near my books which I've never had an issue with usually he points to the books , stares at the floor and occasionally he use to look at me then the floor repeatedly I'm not religious however i believe in certain bits about the after life so I've always taken that as a going to a bad place sign ... and I've never let it bother me however tonight as I write this I am for the first time scared of Steve.... usually I see Steve just as I'm abt 2 pass out so I always say goodnight to him and I did the same tonight.. However I think somethings aggravated him because tonight when I went to sleep I lay down and got comfy did my goodnight and went to sleep had a normal dream which I can still recall vividly for ppl interested in silence to do with dreams ... however I woke up not even half an hour later to hear someone walking in my room (I do however share my room ) so I imagined it was just my sister walking to her bed but it wasn't after it all happened within a second i sat up to see her in bed asleep so ik it was Steve that did this ....

But as i woke from my measles 30 minutes of sleep I heard the walking next to my bed along side the faint plastic sound as there's a small bag next to my bed ... Steve never got this close so I thought maybe he does this when I complrlty asleep to make sure I'm OK but I knew something was wrong when I couldn't move my legs anything above my ankle couldn't move which is highly unusual for me usually I can move and walk abou while seeing Steve but still I was pinned to the bed my Steve it felt weird and I felt powerless  that's when I felt a large heavy body lay onttop of me one are over mine the torso leaning onto mine and the head trying to bury its self in my neck ..  which is bizarre as only one person does that with me when I sleep and that person is currently hours away and Steve being yhe only one to know that it just confirms that tonight was Steve.... Steve lay onto of me like that for what felt like ages until I felt his hand slip between my waist and the mattress then he started moving his hand up to clarify to the readers I'm female with obvious features that show that I'm female so as you can imagine Steve moving his hand up my body made me feel very uncomftable at this point I wanted him to leave so when I tried to fight back and move him I was only faced with a tingling  pain from my paralysis 

Eventually i  realised I could move my feet and build my movement up from there the second I could move I sat up to make sure it was not Steve if it was a person I wanted them to get caught red handed but when there was no one there Ik it was Steve and Steve wasn't anywhere to be seen when I sat up still half asleep 

So please reddit I'm asking for your help why the sudden change ? Why so forward even after he knows my past ? Why me ? Why tonight ? And mostly how do I get rid of him for good ??",1,1735872016.0,SleepParalysisStories,0,1.0,False
1hsc02m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hsc02m/sudden_insomnia_and_heat/,Sudden insomnia and heat,"Hi,

I'm a 21-year-old man (57kg) and I've been getting very little sleep for the past 6 days, only 1 to 2 hours per night.

As usual, I go to bed around 11 p.m., except that I seem to be stuck in a state of semi-sleep, and in the end I end up waking up completely. I only manage to fall asleep around.
I've started to feel very hot for no reason, even though it's 18.5 degrees in my room. My hands quickly become clammy, I sometimes feel a wave of heat around my face, and sometimes I end up with sweat on my ankles and chest/neck.

I don't think it's the fault of my clothes + bedding, as the problem disappears in the morning when I'm almost ""cold"".

I don't drink anything exciting (tea, coffee), I eat light and 3 hours before going to bed, I'm no more stressed than usual. In general, my habits haven't changed at all. 
I had a thyroid blood test for other health problems (IBS) and everything was normal.

I would like to know if anyone knows what could be the cause of my ailment, and if I should go directly to a GP or wait to see how it evolves. ",1,1735871966.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1hsbzuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hsbzuy/starting_this_journey/,Starting this journey,"I've been overweight since I was a preteen, and it's always been a struggle to lose weight. Diets always fail me as I can't stick to them long-term even if I have positive results short-term as they typically just aren't realistic for me/my family to sustain.


For the past 12 years I had hit a plateau, fluxuating between 175 to 177 pounds at every annual checkup at the doctors. While still much too heavy for my short stature of 4'11"", no adverse health concerns/issues had come up and I'd been pretty comfortable with my bigger size. 


At my annual checkup this year however, I had gained 40 pounds from my last checkup, and am the heaviest/biggest I have ever been. For the last month, I've felt things getting harder to do, and I'm getting winded easier. Playing with the kids is exhausting, and going for our 1-mile hikes now hurts. I'm lacking energy, and know it's more than just my age (almost 40). I mentioned weight loss to my doctor and asked for a nutritionist referral, but because I'm miraculously somehow not pre-diabetic and have no verifiable health issues related to weight, my insurance plan doesn't cover it. So she just stated ""portion size matters"" while showing me a plate larger than I ever use and asking if I want to consider bariatric surgery. I do not want to consider surgery at this point, but am not opposed in the future if my health dictates such. She also informed me that I wouldn't qualify for any medications as I'm not pre-diabetic, despite me being one of the only members of my family who is not diabetic. My mom, dad, siblings, grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles ALL have type 2 diabetes.  I'm actually shocked I don't and am not even pre-diabetic. I am starting to develop high blood pressure, but not yet high enough to be on medication.  I didn't ask for meds, but she made sure to inform me not to ask until/unless I developed health problems. 


So, it's time for a change to feel good again. I'm not going to regularly watch the scale as I make changes, as I am looking for non-scale victories, and know that not seeing the number change makes me want to give up far too easily. I work a high-stress emotionally heavy job, and don't want to add to my mental load with a number. I do not have a set goal weight, my goal is to hike that mile without being in pain at the end, and to have my clothing fit correctly without being snug (I have not upsized my clothing through the gain, but have noticed them being much more snug than I find comfortable). I plan to weigh myself quarterly to track scale progress, but not to put my successes into that number itself. 


I've re-downloaded MyFitnessPal, and am tracking everything I consume. I've not had a soda in almost a week, which is a big change for me (two 20oz bottles of Pepsi daily for years).  I bought a Cirkul and am using GoSip cartridges to avoid migraines from caffeine withdrawal, and to have flavor since I've not found a bottled water I like the taste of and don't  like our tap water. I took a sip of my husband's Code Red Mt Dew earlier and it was so sweet I felt sick - when it used to be one of my faves. I feel like that is a small victory when unhealthy drinks taste too sweet. I quit drinking soda once before, and remember the 12 pound in a month weight loss. Then I got pregnant and quit trying to lose weight, and succumbed to my Pepsi craving. 


I've also stopped using creamer in my morning coffee opting for just sweet n low for now, with plans to cut down how many packets I use gradually until I can just drink black coffee. I've changed from whole milk to 2%, and will gradually move to skim. I know these are only small changes, but they don't feel too big to sustain long-term and hopefully several small changes can add up to a big positive change in health over time. 


The one single time I was able to have a nutritionist visit was a free but required visit for a lower rate on my employers health insurance plan. The advice they gave was that it is much easier to stick to adding or replace something than it is to take something away, and then do it every day until it is a habit. Add an extra glass of water before bed and when first waking up. Start 10 minutes of exercise once a day until it's a habit, then add more minutes/strenuous activity when it feels easy. Still have mashed potatoes and gravy, but cut down the scoop size. Don't cut out anything completely unless finding a suitable healthier alternative you can stick with, but change how often or the portion size instead, and add something else (have your chocolate, but add eating a vegetable before eating the chocolate. Have your fried chicken for dinner, but add drinking a whole glass of water before eating it for some examples they gave) I think this is probably pretty decent advice that I'll start taking. 


This weekend we are putting together an elliptical, since I know I will never actually make a trip to a physical gym. But I can watch a show in the evening and use the elliptical intermittently while I do. Some movement is better than none, and I will eventually build up how long of a spurt I do on it while watching TV and waiting for the dishwasher or laundry to finish. 


Questions I have for those of you much further into your journey: 


Does  it matter when I exercise? Would it be better in the morning before work, when getting home from work, or an hour after dinner before bed? I'm not even sure it matters when I do it, as long as I do it. What was easiest to incorporate into your day? 


Are there ready-to-eat or microwave options I can easily add/replace my lunches with that are only 300-400 calories that will leave me satisfied until 6pm dinner? I have a nut allergy and several broken teeth so any nut-safe easier to chew protein options will be highly appreciated! Everything I come up with is mostly dairy with little to no protein. I also am terrible at meal planning/prepping and frequently forget my lunch at home during the week, so things I can leave in the office fridge or in my desk would be very helpful - and will help cut down how often I door dash unhealthy lunches. 


I typically don't eat breakfast, and just have 2-3 cups of coffee. I'm not hungry til around 11am, nearly lunch time. Is it true that I'm causing my body to think it's ""starving"" by not eating breakfast so it hoards all energy sources (fat)? I don't intentionally fast, I'm just not hungry until lunch! 


I am open to and welcoming of any free resources that you have found to be most helpful to your journey!

I think of the ones I tried. I loved The Season of Ghosts, The Phenomena of Witchcraft, and The Flame of the Bear most...!

**The Season of Ghosts** (*bergamot, frankincense, rose geranium, ginger, lemongrass, and blood orange*) Opens with the candies that lived in grandmother's crystal dishes - the confectionary citrus sweetness of pillowy circus peanuts and tangy jellied oranges glowing like stained glass. But it's the turn it takes, the transformation that haunts: a slow bloom of golden musty glamour that hints at powder puffs and hat veils, of the musky, mossy, bronze grandeur of those perfumes that filled rooms with their presence and lingered for days in fur coats. It's finding faded sepia-tinted photos in an ornate old candy tin of your grandmother from that unmistakable era, each image radiating the warmth of a moment when time moved slower, and youth seems older than our own age now, more weighted with substance and shadow.

**Midnight Marzipan** (*a ground almond snowpack glistening under a chilly scattering of sugar-bright stars, standing out against a night sky of the darkest cacao*) I braced myself for the marzipan in this one; I didn't even realize I did it, but when I finally smelled what was actually happening in the scent, I realized I had been holding my breath. Though I love marzipan --adore it!-- both in scent and taste, it can overwhelm with the high-pitched peal of sugary sweetness. What I got instead was the deep, full, resonant, sonorous richness of barely sweet, dark, dark chocolate. The marzipan was a soft, trilling frill, fluttering at the edges. A duet between Darth Vader and Megan Mullally, where the Dark Side of the Force becomes velvet cocoa-dusted truffles and somehow makes Karen Walker's signature giggle feel like sugared almond stardust on snow.

**Faunalia** (*a thick, starlit, unspoiled forest, with a burst of wild musk, opobalsamum, black bryony, mandragora, and hemlock*) Like opening a forgotten storybook, where the forest's scent rises between pages tinged with the echo of vanilla - not the sharp bite of pine or wet earth, but something once growing but softly bespelled, slumbering and subdued. The musks feel antique rather than wild, a soft sepia tone rather than vivid green. It's what you might smell if you pressed your nose to an illustration of dark woods in a Victorian fairy tale, where the ink itself carries old magic and time-worn pages hold the memory of primordial forest and ancient greenwoods.

**Poor Monkey** (*pink lotus root and fig milk with ylang ylang, bourbon vanilla, soft myrrh, fir, khus, and sandalwood incense*) Like preserves made from petals gathered too early for dew - a tender, translucent jelly that holds summer's sweetness suspended in light, the way an altar holds its morning offerings. Fresh figs split open like pale stars, lotus petals floating in milk-white bowls, and unburnt sticks of sandalwood waiting patiently - sweetness as a promise, like tomorrow's devotions already taking shape in the quiet hours before sunrise.

**Pomegranate Milk** The red sun races through winter-stained snow like Dracula's eyes in that final chase - all grenadine turned lurid and glowing with the day's dying light. Why does this perfume also remind me of Japanese candy discovered in the back of an import shop, that distinctive musty-sweet chalkiness? Perhaps it's the way time and context reshape sweetness into something stranger - in sunset's crimson hour or years on a forgotten shelf, what was once simple pleasure takes on an elegant decay.

**Porcelain Krampus** (*brown leather and a bundle of switches encased in pale white orris root and rice powder, translucent white musk, Himalayan ambrette seed, and milky vanilla*.) She sits pristine in tissue paper, this porcelain child with cool milky skin and frost-pale curls, radiating a sweetness both powder-pure and glazed smooth - like marshmallows dissolving in winter air, like sugared pears turned to frost on the windowsill. Though she glows with innocence, you know better. That's why her tiny severed hand lives in your pocket, wrapped in a handkerchief, small and impossibly perfect, still trailing that haunting whisper of confectioner's sugar and cold cream. You tell yourself it's for safe-keeping, and perhaps that's true in a sense,  but really, you're keeping yourself safe --from her gaze in the dark each night, as she watches you from high on her shelf, with a smile that's patient and sweet, and ever-so-slightly wrong.

**Hard Cider Cake** (*a thick, spongy white cake spiked with hard apple cider and frosted with whiskey-laden buttercream*) A possum-riding gnome rolls up in a car made of twigs and acorns. ""Get in, loser,"" they grin, ""we're having cider with the Green Man."" What they pour is fresh-pressed and unsweetened, with something unexpectedly verdant lurking in its depths - like drinking autumn sunshine filtered through new spring leaves. The old magics are simple ones: apples and leaves, earth and air, each sip tasting of secrets whispered between the roots of ancient trees

**A Cup of Tea in the Verandah** (*black tea and bergamot shimmer in the glow of sunlit amber as cypress boughs cast lingering shadows, the heart blooms softly with jasmine sambac and tender orris*) A single bloom emerges from craggy castle walls like a long-lost, long-gone friend impossibly appearing in morning light - its petals glowing rosy with the same translucent warmth as sunbeams through stained glass. The stone beneath holds secrets in its tea-stained shadows, cool and tannic as bitter centuries of words unsaid, feelings unreturned. Memory blooms here, unbearably delicate yet persistent and softly strangling as ivy, reaching through time toward a cup that was never filled.

**Phantom Team of Horses** (*a spectral cacophony of shimmering, translucent dun sandalwood, grey amber, and wraith-chilled chestnut galloping through the mist-cloaked shadows of time, a clattering of clove and black pepper, and a crack of phantom leather*) Through mist and gloaming, phantom hooves prowl and roam - a nutty-woody-resinous haunting that refuses to settle into silence. The wood whispers like morning fog, barely there; a subtle saltiness clings to the chestnut's echo, while grey amber broods beneath it all, murky as twilight in forgotten hollows. Like those ghostly horses that never quite reach their destination, these scents circle and hover, their spectral stampede more whisper than thunder, more shadow than storm.

**The Phenomena of Witchcraft** (*green balsam, bay leaf, fossilized amber, blackened vetiver, and clove bud cloaked in oud*) The morning after a midnight revel, musty clove smoke and primordial resins mingling in the morning's murk and morass. When witches trade their broomsticks for bar stools - all that wild green magic gone deliciously seedy, forest herbs trampled underfoot in an alley behind a dive bar, sacred incense mingling with spilled spirits. Like knocking thrice on heaven's door and getting an answer from somewhere decidedly south.

**Frau Holle** (*snow-covered pines, witches' herbs, bestial musk, flax, and ethereal flowers that represent both birth and death*) Sometimes, we run across a perfume that bears little resemblance to our expectations when it comes to its blueprint of notes. Such is the case with this atmosphere of bracing winter mint and bitter forest berries, scattered across the rapidly dissipating warmth of a recently vacated featherbed. The fog from the hearth is dusky and strange, like herb-steeped milk in an abandoned bowl.

**Lavender Kitchen Mouse** (*lavender cotton candy fur and vanilla popcorn balls, sent skittering out of the kitchen with a good-natured wave of our polished wood rolling pin*) For a popcorn devotee - nay, a popcorn zealot who would happily survive on nothing but perfectly popped kernels for the rest of time, dental floss bills be damned - there is nothing quite like that first hit of toasty corn. Whether it's movie theater butter pooling in the ridges, nutritional yeast giving it that umami funk, or simply sea salt bringing out corn's inherent sweetness (and let's be clear: adding caramel, or indeed any form of sweetness to popcorn, is an unforgivable crime against both nature and the pure pleasure of popped corn). But here's something entirely unexpected: that perfect salty-corny base sprinkled with lavender's crisp, herbaceous brightness. Like finding fresh sprigs tucked between kernels, adding an aromatic sharpness that cuts through the savory warmth. It's a weird combination and probably shouldn't work - much like how finding a beady-eyed little mouse nibbling in your popcorn bowl as you reach for another handful would be pretty jarring - but somehow, this odd little creature has charmed its way into my heart.

**Ube Sufganiyot** A soft swirl of fried dough, a scant sifting of powdered sugar, and a filling that melts all its elements - white chocolate, pistachio, and coconut - into one creamy, nutty reverie. Pair this with Lavender Kitchen Mouse above for the perfect snack box curation at an all-night Wes Anderson movie marathon, where every treat is just slightly offbeat and endearingly peculiar.

**Paysage** (*the pale moon pouring magic: Tunisian opium and mugwort with blackened bourbon vanilla, tuberose, glittering white musk, datura accord, wild plum, and tobacco absolute.*) In the bottle, I know exactly what this is: my mother-in-law's Jólakaka, all rum-soaked candied lemon peel and winter warmth. But on skin, it transforms into something far more mysterious - like a lemon icicle in one of those classic locked room mysteries where the detective finds nothing but an inexplicable puddle of water beside the body. Sharp and crystalline yet impossible to grasp, bright citrus frozen into a vanishing elegance, leaving you to question whether you really understood what you experienced at all.

**Eighteenth Lash** (*vanillekipferl plunked in a pile of pine needles*) Buttery, crumbly, melty cookies with a base of bitter, oily walnuts and a rich, caramelized shortbread bottom...baked in the steam and sap of an enchanted pine's resinous heart, they've taken on the deep forest's secrets - as if being born in the heart of an ancient conifer has imbued them with its balsamic soul. Wear this scent and imagine this treat while Chelsea Wolfe's haunting voice carries you far over misty mountains cold, where dark things sleep in hollow halls beneath the fells.

**The Human Double** (*a shadow-blackened fougere steeped in an uncanny, discomfiting lavender tar*) Imagine if lavender went sepulchral, if coumarin turned to ash, if oakmoss grew on graves - this is the shadow-self of a classic fougère. Though we don't know this one's building blocks, we know its intentions: the familiar herbal notes have been submerged in something black and viscous, like catching your reflection in a darkened window at midnight and watching it linger after you've walked away. Doppelgangers embody pure existential horror - they violate our most fundamental sense of uniqueness through their unheimlich theft of selfhood. This is what happens when your double claims your signature scent as its own, and worse, wears it with more authority than you ever did.

**Gently, Gently, They Are Timid** (*candied orange and pink peppercorn, sugared freesia petals, vanilla bean, and white hone*y) ""The weird the Spirit brings,"" as mentioned in the lyrics of this perfume's inspiration is jaunty and bright, and indeed spirited. This could be the signature scent of the most gleeful parlor ghost, whose enthusiasm for the spectral life is utterly contagious. The first manifestation brings bursts of rosy spice and diaphanous flower petals before settling into its true form: a tatted lace doily holding the memory of creamed toffees and sugared meringues, all grounded in something as smooth and refined as the cream in a proper lady's tea. The spirits probably attend her séances just to watch her elaborate table-floating mechanisms with fond amusement - they're happy to play along with a hostess who goes to such lengths to entertain them.

**Lavender Avocado Toast** (*a toasted slice from the middle of a springy, oaty loaf blessed with a rich green schmear and sprinkled with lemon juice and lavender sea salt*) This is not the avocado toast I was expecting - but rather a delicate, floral violet-tinged lavender jam mingling with thick, cultured salted butter of such distinct creamy richness, all melting into warm, crusty golden toast that's been dusted with what might be flower-infused sugar, might be fairy dust. This is what happens when your trendy café is secretly run by flower fairies who've decided to put their own enchanting spin on the brunch menu.

**The Flame of the Bear** (*fir resin, bayberry, myrrh, mistletoe, and oak bark*) When I smell The Flame of the Bear, memory catches in my throat like pine smoke: the same grandmother who brought out those crystal dishes of candy I mentioned in The Season of Ghosts had a bayberry candle whose scent is everything that Christmas is to me today, as an adult: a soft sweetness twined with delicate spice, the very essence of evergreen twilights and December promises. She would unwrap it from tissue paper with such care, as if it held more than just wax and scent - and of course it did. Some scents are time machines, and this one carries me back through winters past, when love could be captured in something as simple as candlelight and its reflection in her eyes. I can't smell this without seeing her light it, then reaching for my hand (so I wouldn't touch it!)

When artisanal coffee roaster Peppers McGee\* accidentally summons Krampus with her darkest, most potent brew yet, she doesn't expect him to become her most demanding regular.

1hsbv6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hsbv6c/its_been_almost_a_year/,It’s been almost a year ,"She got upset we had our disagreement and she quit talking to me. There have been moments we reconnected for a bit but it’s never been the same. There have been glimpses of hope she wants to be friends again

She has at least one other good friend now. Because of the timing it kind of hurts sometimes because it was around the time we stopped talking so I feel she replaced me. But that’s silly and unhelpful for me to think though I do sometimes feel jealous because they are close and she says she loves her. In a way it gives me hope she can or will love me as I know I am just as kind and just as loving and can be a good friend just like her if given a chance, and I have my own unique personality and benefit only I can provide. I feel a year is plenty of time and space to forgive me. I apologized and expressed how I feel and how much she and our friendship means to me. I’ve tried to see things from her perspective. I’ve given her compliments and in the past small gifts. I offered to treat her for her birthday when things were good. More recently I have brought up things people and pictures that helped us connect and remember the past. I have given her my contact info just in case and suggested we hang out or get together perhaps for coffee when she is ready. I’ve told her little life updates about my day and asked about hers. I’ve encouraged her professional life and done my best to stay out of her personal life though I haven’t been perfect as it Ms been an area of dissent. I’ve complimented her about her internal and external beauty. I’ve told her I will always be there for her and love her unconditional and that there is no pressure for when/if she wants to talk. 

All of this with little in return. At one point in the beginning she had blocked me so idk if I’m blocked now but she has responded since then so my guess is no. A year is a long time and while things may not ever be the same I thought we would be further along in our friendship by now. Maybe she’s not ready? Maybe she doesn’t want to be friends again after all and changed her mind. Should I ask her? Is a year too long to wait? ",1,1735871558.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

## Securing Your PC: A Deep Dive into Smart PC Locker Pro

In today's interconnected world, protecting your digital assets is paramount.  A single security breach can lead to significant financial losses, identity theft, and irreparable damage to your reputation.  While comprehensive antivirus software forms a crucial part of your digital defense, it often falls short in preventing unauthorized physical access to your computer. This is where Smart PC Locker Pro steps in, offering a robust and versatile solution to lock down your PC and safeguard your sensitive data.

### Understanding Smart PC Locker Pro: More Than Just a Password

Smart PC Locker Pro, developed by NoVirusThanks, is a powerful application designed to comprehensively lock your computer, preventing unauthorized access to your files and system functions.  It's not just about a simple password lock; it's a multi-layered security system built to deter even the most determined intruders.  Think of it as a digital vault for your entire PC.

Unlike basic screen lock utilities, Smart PC Locker Pro offers several key advantages:

* **Unbreakable Password Protection:**  Secure your PC with a strong, custom password, ensuring only authorized users can unlock it.  The software's robust algorithm protects against brute-force attacks, making it highly resistant to unauthorized access.

* **Safe Mode Lockdown:**  Many security threats attempt to bypass standard security measures by booting into Safe Mode. Smart PC Locker Pro cleverly circumvents this tactic, effectively locking your PC even when in Safe Mode, both with and without networking capabilities. This proactive approach significantly enhances your overall security.

* **Critical Function Disabling:**  Smart PC Locker Pro disables key functions that could be exploited to bypass the lock. This includes disabling Task Manager (taskmgr.exe), preventing malicious users from terminating the security process itself.  WinKeys, CTRL+ALT+DEL, and CD-ROM access are also disabled, eliminating common methods of unauthorized entry. This layered approach makes cracking the system significantly more difficult.

* **Advanced Logging and Monitoring:**  The software meticulously logs all unsuccessful login attempts. This provides a valuable audit trail, allowing you to identify potential security breaches and take appropriate action.  This detailed logging is crucial for post-incident analysis and security improvements.

* **Highly Customizable:**  Smart PC Locker Pro allows you to personalize the lock screen with a custom wallpaper image, adding a touch of personalization while reinforcing security. You can also configure the software to automatically lock your PC after a specified period of inactivity, ensuring it's always protected when left unattended.  This flexible configuration allows you to tailor the software to your specific needs and workflow.


### Why Choose Smart PC Locker Pro Over Other PC Security Solutions?

While numerous PC security solutions exist, Smart PC Locker Pro distinguishes itself by focusing specifically on preventing unauthorized physical access.  This complements other security measures, such as antivirus software and firewalls, which primarily focus on online threats.  Consider the following:


* **Beyond Antivirus:** Antivirus software excels at detecting and removing malware, but it won't stop someone physically accessing your computer and stealing your data. Smart PC Locker Pro adds that crucial layer of physical security.  It's a powerful addition to, not a replacement for, your existing security suite.

* **Data Protection at its Core:** The primary function of Smart PC Locker Pro is to protect your sensitive data. Whether it's personal financial information, confidential business documents, or simply your cherished photos, this software ensures that unauthorized access is prevented.

* **Peace of Mind:** Knowing your PC is securely locked, even in situations beyond your immediate control, provides invaluable peace of mind. This is particularly crucial in shared workspaces, public places, or when stepping away from your computer for extended periods.


### Real-World Applications: Protecting Your Data in Various Scenarios

Smart PC Locker Pro isn't just a theoretical security solution; it's a practical tool with wide-ranging applications:

* **Remote Work Security:**  For businesses with remote employees, Smart PC Locker Pro offers a critical layer of security.  It ensures that company data remains protected even if an employee's laptop is lost or stolen. This is especially important when dealing with sensitive client information or proprietary business data.

* **Public Access Protection:**  Working in coffee shops, libraries, or other public spaces exposes your computer to potential theft. Smart PC Locker Pro provides an extra layer of protection, even if your laptop is stolen, preventing immediate access to your data.

* **Home User Security:**  Even at home, the risk of unauthorized access exists.  Whether it's curious family members, house guests, or potential burglars, Smart PC Locker Pro provides a reliable barrier to protect your personal files and information.


### Additional Security Measures and Best Practices

While Smart PC Locker Pro offers robust protection, combining it with other security best practices is crucial:

* **Strong Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for your PC and all online accounts.  Avoid easily guessable passwords and consider using a password manager to securely store your credentials.

* **Regular Software Updates:**  Keep your operating system and all software applications up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Where available, enable MFA for all your online accounts to add an extra layer of security.

* **Data Backups:**  Regularly back up your important data to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to protect against data loss in case of theft or damage.


### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can Smart PC Locker Pro be bypassed?**

A: While no security system is completely unbreakable, Smart PC Locker Pro is designed to be highly resistant to unauthorized access.  The combination of password protection, critical function disabling, and Safe Mode lockdown makes it significantly more difficult to bypass than standard screen lock utilities.

**Q: Is Smart PC Locker Pro compatible with all Windows versions?**

A:  Please refer to the NoVirusThanks website for the most up-to-date compatibility information.

**Q: What happens if I forget my password?**

A:  NoVirusThanks provides detailed instructions on password recovery, though this process may vary depending on your chosen security settings.  It is crucial to remember your password, or have a secure method of retrieving it.

**Q: Does Smart PC Locker Pro slow down my computer?**

A: Smart PC Locker Pro is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing any impact on your computer's performance.

1hsbtdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/showndtalks/comments/1hsbtdn/i_dont_like_being_single_yet_here_i_am/,I don't like being single. Yet here I am.,"You know, I’ve always had this strange relationship with being single. Honestly, *I don’t like it*. I’ll say it outright because, sure, being single *sounds* empowering—freedom, independence, all that jazz—but for me? It often feels like this weird, lonely silence when I really crave someone to share moments with. Like, I can’t count how many times a random Wednesday night has me curled up on the couch, microwave popcorn in hand, watching some sappy rom-com and thinking, *Why isn’t that my life right now?*

And I know, I *know*, people love to tell me to “enjoy the single season” or “love yourself first”—as if maybe I haven’t spent hours scrolling through solo self-care ideas or Googling “how to be happy without a relationship.” I mean, I get it. There’s wisdom in that—sure. Even Buddhism speaks to this idea of finding peace within yourself. There’s this teaching from Thich Nhat Hanh that says, “You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.” Maybe that includes you, loving yourself enough to feel free to be single, but honestly? *Being free can suck*. Freedom gets boring when there’s no one co-piloting your life adventures, asking if you want to pull off the freeway for that random diner or reminding you to pack an umbrella.

I guess that’s what I miss the most—it’s not even the *big* stuff. It’s the mundane, everyday rhythm of a good relationship. Someone to text, “Hey, guess what happened today?” without overthinking whether I’m “bothering them.” Someone to remind me to breathe when I lose my keys or start spiraling into a tornado of existential angst. Emily Dickinson once wrote, “The soul selects her own society... Then shuts the door.” For a while, I thought that sounded so profound. But now? God, it sounds lonely. Who wants to shut the door on anyone who could make life feel truly shared?

I remember once reading in the Bible, Genesis 2:18 where God says, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” That hits so deeply, doesn’t it? It’s not about having someone around just to stave off boredom or meet some superficial longing—it’s that *life was meant to be walked together.* Even spiritually, communities, families, love—these are supposed to be cornerstones of our existence. We need others. I need others.

But here’s the thing: society has this weird double message about relationships. On one hand, you’re bombarded by Instagram posts of couples with captions like “my everything” as if the single life isn’t worth flaunting. Then *boom!* Two seconds later, some TED Talk or Twitter thread tells you that staying single into your 30s or beyond is the “key to self-discovery.” It’s enough to make my head spin. Like, I do value self-discovery—of course I do! But I can also confidently say I just *really, truly, deeply want to not be single*. Is that so bad? Is it un-feminist? Am I too “needy”?

I don’t know. Maybe it’s because love feels baked into everything worth celebrating. Think about it—our greatest art, music, and stories are *all about love.* Shakespeare couldn’t stop writing about it! “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”—people still read that 400 years later because it touches this universal need to feel worthy of someone else’s admiration, someone else’s consistent presence. Even philosophy dives into this yearning. Aristotle called humans “social animals,” and existentialists would say that at the core of all human hunger lies this desperate need for connection. I feel that so deeply. Sure, we were born alone and we’ll die alone—but between those two points? I *want someone beside me.*

What’s ironic is how sometimes people act like disliking being single equals desperation. Like, no—I’m not trying to stuff some random person into this gaping emotional void just so I feel better. I’ve been in bad relationships. Believe me, there’s nothing worse than that—I still remember being ghosted by someone I thought was “the one” and feeling more alone with them than I ever could be by myself. So it’s not about settling; it’s about believing I can find someone out there who clicks with me like puzzle pieces finally fitting together. Life’s messy, but it’s the kind of mess I want to clean up hand-in-hand with another person—someone who will say, “It’s okay, we’ll figure it out together.”

I don’t think there’s shame in craving connection. Even Rumi, the Persian poet and mystic, who’s all about transcending physical existence, said “The wound is the place where the light enters you.” Maybe singleness has been that wound for me—a place for wisdom to seep in. I’ve felt the weight of my solitude, sure. It’s taught me resilience, patience, maybe even some grace. But let me tell you, I’m ready for the light that enters in the form of love. After all, no one writes poetry about being alone forever—not the good kind, anyway.

# It’s Not Just About Romance—It’s About Belonging

You know what’s funny? When I say I don’t like being single, people always assume it’s because I’m desperate for a whirlwind romance or some Nicholas Sparks-level love story. And sure, romantic love is part of it. Who wouldn’t want that magnetic connection, the butterflies, and the deep intimacy? But for me, it’s almost more about feeling like I *belong*. Like I’ve found my person, the one who “gets” me without me having to explain everything in long paragraphs.

Human beings are wired for connection. Seriously, it’s literally built into us. Some researchers say that it's the evolutionary need for survival—like back in the caveman days, people *had* to stick together to avoid getting eaten or freezing to death. But now, that need for connection feels... *different*. You don’t need a partner to physically survive in today’s world (thank you, central heating, grocery delivery services, and Amazon Prime), but emotionally? It’s a whole different game. Cuddling up to my cat after a bad day will never—no matter how adorable she is—replace hearing another human whisper, “Hey, it’s gonna be okay, I’ve got you.”

Even Maslow’s hierarchy of needs speaks to this. Right above basic physical requirements like food and water is *love and belonging*. Friends help. Family helps. But isn’t there just something so specific, so tender, about being someone’s favorite person? About *knowing* someone else is choosing you, day after day, to share their world with? That’s the kind of belonging I crave—not in a dependent, clingy way, but in the “we’re building something together” kind of way.

One of my favorite writers, Maya Angelou, put it beautifully: “I belong to myself. I am very proud of that. I am also very proud that I belong to others and they belong to me.” That’s where it lands for me. It’s not just about independence or dependence—it’s about *interdependence*. It’s about sharing this wild, messy life with someone else who’ll laugh at my bad jokes, support my dreams, and remind me to eat something when I’m too busy to care for myself.

Now, society often paints this perfect picture of what that type of connection looks like. It’s always two attractive people, staring lovingly across a candlelit table, but *real belonging* doesn’t have to look that shiny. Sometimes it’s messy. Sometimes it’s just about sitting in silence on the couch, scrolling through your own phones but fully comfortable in the other’s presence. Sometimes it’s midnight talks about the meaning of life or quietly making coffee for each other on groggy Monday mornings. It’s simple, but it’s human. It’s everything I yearn for.

And isn’t that kind of connection a reflection of something bigger? They say love is the closest we can get to understanding the divine. I’m not sure if I totally understand that yet, but sometimes, being single just makes me feel... disconnected from the way life is supposed to flow. Maybe that’s what C.S. Lewis was hinting at when he said in *The Four Loves*: “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken.” There’s fear in wanting love; I’ll admit that. But there’s also a kind of longing that feels like *truth*.

# Can We Talk About the Pressure to Be Okay With Singleness?

Here’s the irony: society tells me to love being single, to embrace it, to thrive on my own. Honestly? The pressure to love singleness feels *just as overwhelming* as the pressure to be in a picture-perfect relationship. I mean, have you ever picked up *any* self-help book in the last five years? They’re all filled with advice like, “You don’t need anyone else to complete you!” or “Being single is your superpower!” And sure, I get it in theory. Life shouldn’t revolve around romantic entanglements. I shouldn’t feel like less of a person because I don’t have a partner. But sometimes, this *relentless* emphasis on “independence” almost makes me feel... ashamed for wanting love. Like there’s something wrong with me for looking at happy couples and wishing I had someone to hold my hand too.

The truth is, independence and love don’t have to be opposites. They can, and *should*, coexist. Some of the healthiest relationships I’ve seen are between people who fiercely love and respect each other but also have their own hobbies, friends, and goals. It’s not about losing yourself to a relationship—it’s about *adding* to your life by sharing it with someone else.

But admitting you don’t like being single? It gets weird reactions. Sometimes it feels like saying, “I want a partner” is immediately interpreted as, “I’m incomplete without someone.” There’s this myth out there that emotionally healthy people don’t *long* for a relationship—but that’s just not true. Longing doesn’t equal weakness. It’s just... human.

Even ancient philosophers believed this—look at Plato’s *Symposium*. You know the story about soulmates, right? That humans were once these androgynous beings with two faces, four arms, and four legs until the gods split them in half, and now we spend our lives searching for our missing other half? That myth has stuck around because it speaks to something real. Maybe it’s not totally literal (thank goodness, because imagine the leg cramps), but the idea that we’re wired to find connection, to seek out love, feels so true.

So, hey, if you’ve ever been shamed for admitting that you want a partner... I get it. It’s hard to balance individuality with our natural desire for connection. But if I’ve learned one thing, it’s that wanting love doesn’t make you weak—it makes you *alive*.

I'm looking for a run club in downtown Toronto (i live nearby uoft main campus area) that trains somewhat competitively. I'm 28F and I'm used to structured training. Per week, my workouts used to look something this: Tuesday hills, Thursday threshold, Saturday morning speed, Sunday easy long long and post run coffee.

 I used to train like this with my previous run club in HAlifax but moving to Toronto most clubs only run for fun. Some paid clubs also only include 1 social workout per week, which is not really enough for me.

Any recommendations?

Additional information:  I loved the sense of community and I met great friends through structured training in my old club. We had this philosophy of running with mindfulness, helping each other succeed rather than compete against each other, practiced meditation techniques, drills to improve running technique, breathing techniques to calm anxiety before and after workouts. My coach, who taught me all of this, sadly died two years ago. He always coached without charging a penny.  He was very loved in the running community in Halifax.  I'd even be willing to start a free running club with this mindset because it was life changing for me and most likely I will not come across something like that. I feel lost without this.

I’m looking to bolster my network setup after experiencing some recent oddities. I currently use AT&T Fiber for both my home and business (a coffee shop/bistro) and am considering moving into the Ubiquiti ecosystem.

I now work from home as a DevOps engineer for a three-letter agency, so I want to ensure I’m investing in the right equipment to secure both my home and business networks.

From what I’ve read, it seems like AT&T Fiber doesn’t always play well with Ubiquiti switches. I was hoping for some advice on where to start. My plan involves running about 10 PoE cameras at my business and 6 at home. I’ve been looking at the Dream Machine Pro or SE, paired with a couple of Ubiquiti access points (recently ditched my TP-Link extenders).

1hsbmg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1hsbmg6/clownitis_klownitis/,CLOWNITIS (Klown-I-Tis),"

Walking through his front door, Henry called for his mother. Eerie silence is all he got in response, so he slowly and mindfully closed the door believing her to be napping. Still, an uneasy feeling boiled in his stomach, especially with the outbreak of the disease known as “Clownitis” spreading wildly in an unpredictable pattern.

This disease turned ordinary people into twisted iterations of clowns. If contracted the disease would enact an over production of melanin causing large unnatural brown or black shapes to form on the face resembling clown makeup. People with darker complexions would instead suffer from a vitiligo like whitening of their skin, turning their complexion a stark white with patches of their original skin tone resembling clown makeup. Their eyes held malice and their teeth would somehow double in length and width stretching the lips into twitchy, involuntary smiles. They would laugh in an over the top, animated clown laugh and did so sporadically. In addition to the outer changes were the changes within. The ghastly grinners regressed into a feral state unlocking a primal predator instinct that enhanced their speed and stamina. The horrific jokers were great hunters, preying on animals and humans alike. While feasting on the flesh of their victims they would ask (no one in particular) “Does this meat taste funny to you?” Unsettling as all that may sound it only gets worse, should the victim somehow survive the ordeal then in a day’s time they too would become infected and change into a grotesque clown.

Knowing all this the nine year old cautiously moved deeper into the house trying to be as quiet as he could. Rounding the kitchen corner, his mind started to run wild with thoughts of his mother transformed and waiting for him with a knife. To his relief he was in the clear, but he did notice light brown hairs scattered around the kitchen floor and counter top. Sprinkles of crusted blood trailed from the counter, across the floor and leading into the dining area. His pulse quickened and he unknowingly held his breathe. As he inched his way to the dining room, he told himself internally to turn and runaway; yet he still moved forward.

Reaching the doorway he gently gripped the wood and slowly he took a peek inside. His mother was sitting at the table with her back to him enjoying a meal.

“Hi son!” she said. Aside from her hair looking greasy she seemed normal, nothing else was out of place. Henry replied with hi and he felt the tension leave his body in slow pulsating waves. Feeling confident that his mother was normal he asked her why there was hair in the kitchen and what the red drips were. To which she simply replied, “Does this meat taste funny to you?” The boys fear returned instantly and arose with a heat like a wildfire. His mother turned to face him, Henry’s adrenaline made her movements seem slow, revealing her “CLOWNSFORMATION.” The boy’s legs gave out at the sight. He couldn’t believe it, his mother had been “CLOWNSFORMED” into a card carrying member of the Insane Clown Posse.

Her lips stretched thin over her newly enlarged, blood stained teeth. So thin that her skin had split open in random spots to allow her to create the widest smile he’d ever witnessed. Looking at the table he saw the scraps of his guinea pig, looking back to his mother he saw one of the guinea pigs arms twitching in between two of her box like teeth. The boy’s primal instincts for survival propelled him to his feet and he made a mad dash for the front door, exiting the dining area the same way he came. His mother started laughing wildly and loud. Henry reached the door and unlocked it. As he turned the knob he heard the chair his mother sat upon smack hard on the tile floor. The boy turned to look and saw his mother exit the dining room rapidly through the other door then jump over the back of the couch in the front room followed by a midair front flip that cleared the front of the couch. She landed a perfect dismount on top of the coffee table in the front room breaking through it with bare feet. The broken and splintered wood digging, jabbing and embedding itself in the bottoms of her feet, in between her toes and under her toe nails. The tears of a clown flooded her eyes with the pain she felt showing the boy that the infected were not completely mindless, although he didn’t understand the significance.

Her upper and lower mandibles spread open wide and expelled more loud laughter. Then while using over exaggerated steps she began to mime her way out of an invisible knee high barrier. Henry swung the door open and ran outside, his mother giving chase. She was only two steps behind him when the boy made a sharp right toward the driveway. Her body continued moving forward although she turned her head to face him. She pivoted her body and quickly changed direction, running again toward the boy. Henry had crossed the driveway and his mother was three steps in to her new direction when the boy’s stepfather drove up unexpectedly, hitting the 5’ 2” woman at a speed of seven miles per hour.

The impact bounced the woman off the front of the vehicle, her body making a horn sound when the two collided. She flew up in the sky and crashed onto the trash bins in front of the house, knocking them over and spilling the smelly contents inside. Quickly hopping out of his car, Henry’s stepdad popped open the trunk and opened a pack of zip ties he had just purchased. The six foot, bearded man used them to restrain the unconscious mother to the trash bin handles then called 9-1-1 to report the emergency.

The two sat on the sidewalk waiting for the police and ambulance when Henry started sobbing uncontrollably. His stepfather tried to console him the best he could, saying that all would be fine and that she would be cured in no time. He said this but he said it not knowing if it was at all possible.

Henry’s story is only one of many stories telling the chaos and carnage of carnival freaks. A world increasing in madness and filling with deranged clowns daily. The uninfected continued to fight for their lives just trying to survive each day in a world that’s become a psycho circus.",2,1735870833.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

Max hadn’t seen a single drink in 17 days. A personal record. His last bender had ended in disaster: broken glass, vomit on the carpet, his ex-girlfriend screaming over the phone about the endless phonecalls. This time, he had promised himself he would stay sober. 

The intrusive thoughts were bad, but the cravings were hell. Every morning, he lay in bed, shaking, all day he sat at his desk, shaking, at night, he lay in bed, shaking. And then there was the knocking.

It all started four nights ago. It started quiet at first, just a single, soft knock on the door of flat 4b. When he got out of bed to check, no one was there. 

Strange. You normally need to be buzzed in to get to any of the front doors. Has 3b long-hair left the latch unlocked again? Maybe 4a fish-smell? 5c hot blonde? 

On the second night, it grew louder. More frequent. Max dared not go to the door, paranoia was kicking in. Was this some sort of auditiory hallucination? Some part of the withdrawals that Sandra, his AA sponsor had warned him about? 

By the third night, it had grown even louder. The dull rapping echoed through the empty hallway, rattling Max’s nerves. He stayed up all night waiting for the door to swing open. Or waiting for it to stop and to find some release. He clutched the only thing that gave him any iota of strength - a coin from his AA sponsor, stamped with the serenity prayer and the words ‘One Day at a Time’. It had been her’s from when she had reached 10 years of sobriety.

Now it was the fourth night, and he couldn’t stop thinking about how much easier this would all be if he just had a drink. 

***…***

The knocking started at midnight. As it had every night. 

Max sat in his darkened living room, staring down the hallway at the locked, latched door. It came again, louder still - three definite knocks. 

“Who’s there?” Max’s voice cracked as his words echoed through the room. His throat tightened as the words left him. It was a stupid question—no one would answer. No one ever did.

He tried to ignore it once again, twirling his AA coin around his fingers, feeling the intricate embossings on the sterling piece. The sound grew louder and louder, the knocking became more impatient as the minutes rolled on - or had it been hours?

Max checked his phone.

***1:07am***

The sound hadn’t stopped for an entire hour. The knocks hammered against the door like an urgent heartbeat, each blow vibrating through the floor and sending tremors up Max’s spine. He clutched his head, squeezing his eyes shut, but the sound burrowed into his skull, relentless and inescapable.

Finally Max decided enough was enough. He grabbed his coin firmly in his left hand used his right to yank the door open, expecting to find some sort of prankster, or one of the many strange exhibitions of humans in the freak show that was his flat complex. 

No one was there.

He shut the door, heart racing. He stood behind the closed door for a minute or two, expecting the furious knocks to begin again. 

Silence. 

This confirmed it, it had to be a hallucination. 

As Max turned away from the door, a strange chill crept up his neck— the air had shifted. He shook his head, dismissing the thought. It was just the withdrawals messing with his head. Wasn’t it?

Max trod carefully through the flat. He could finally get some sleep. He entered his lounge, ready to switch off the lamp and get some rest, when his eyes picked up on a foreign object that hadn’t been there before. 

A bottle of whiskey sat unopened on his coffee table, next to an engraved trumbler his late mother had bought as an 18th birthday present. 

Max froze, his blood ran cold and he felt every individual hair stand up along his arms and neck. The bottle gleamed under the lamplight, the amber liquid inside glinting like a cruel invitation. Max’s head became overwhelmed with memories floding back: the warmth of the first sip, the sweet sting as it hit his throat, the way it silenced the chaos. His fingers twitched. He felt them aching, itching to unscrew the cap, but his mind screamed warnings. He had poured every bottle down the drain last month. How the hell was this one here?

“I threw you all out,” he muttered.

He grabbed the bottle, intending to pour it down the sink, but the moment he touched it, it felt as though it touched him back. A sudden freezing sensation shot through his arm.

“Drink.”

Max’s head jerked around, but the room was empty. He tried to release the bottle, but his hands were viced around it, unmoving. 

“No,” He muttered, his voice faltering. “I won’t”.

The bottle grew heavier in his hands. A low, guttural laughter echoed across the room. 

“You’ve already let me in,” the voice rumbled. “Why fight it now?”

“Fuck you!” Max screamed. He hurled the bottle with every ounce of defiance he had left. It shattered, the whiskey spilling like blood across the floor. The voice let out an ear-piercing howl, shaking the foundations of the flat. 

Max staggered back, cluthing the sides of his head as the walls seemed to start to pulse. He stumbled his way to the bathroom, readying himself to vomit. Just as he reached the bathroom sink, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. All of his pain was gone within an instant.

His reflection wasn’t his own.

The figure in the glass staring back at him was thinner, greyer and gaunt, with hollow holes where cheeks should be and black eyes. It’s mouth slowly stretched open into a wide smile. 

“You can never outrun me. I’m in every reflection you see, I’m every drink you crave, every moment of weakness. I will always be here.” it whispered.

Max staggered back, but his body didn’t move. His reflection refused to release him. The mimic stayed where it was, staring at him from the mirror as he screamed. 

“Go ahead,” it hissed at him. “Run, pray, pretend you’re stronger than me, but we both know it’s only a matter of time.”

***…***

The next morning, Sandra arrived at her usual time to check on Max. Her knock was unanswered. “As per fucking usual” She laughed to herself. She knocked once more, slightly heavier this time, but her fist pushed the door open. 

Sandra slowly cased the flat for any sign of Max. Nothing. Then she reached the bathroom. Inside she found Max curled up in the corner of the room, pale-faced, cluthing the coin she had gifted to him. 

“Max?” She whispered, crouching down beside him. 

He looked up, his eyes dark and bloodshot. 

“It doesn’t stop,” He said, his voice echoing defeat. “It’s always there, waiting for me to fuck up.”

Sandra wrapped her arms around him. “One day at a time, Max. We’ll face it, Max. Together. One fight, one breath, one day at a time”

She helped him up onto his feet, and guided him out of the bathroom, but as she started to leave, her gaze flicked to the mirror. For the briefest moment, she saw it - the twisted reflection staring back at her, it’s grin was razor sharp, its eyes widening. But it wasn’t Max’s, it was hers. 

It winked.

Sandra’s breath hitched. She took a step back, blinking hard, but the twisted grin lingered in the mirror—her grin. Her hand trembled as she turned away, her chest tight with a familiar, suffocating ache.

“Come on,” she whispered, her voice steady despite the chill in her chest. “Let’s get through today.”",2,1735870745.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

So, the year’s come to a close, cuffing season is upon us and I’m still single, I feel like it’s time to finally change that. I’ve been looking on and off for about a year now and I’ve decided to give it one more shot and I’m going about it with a better mindset now I think.

I’ll get to the point, I aim to date to marry, I’d say I bring a lot to the table, and my ideal man would be someone who feels similar too. I think a relationship is best when we both bring equal value to the relationship, even if we aren’t necessarily equals in every way. I prefer a man who can lead, but not one who is abusive, or unnecessarily bossy. I want something real and healthy, just also traditional.

I’m religious, however you don’t have to be as long as you can respect that I am. I lean conservative, however I’m not rabid in my views and if you aren’t either. That shouldn’t be a problem either! 

Day to day you’ll find me in a gym, at my desk, in a coffee shop, on a hiking trail, with friends or, when I’m very lucky, in a swimming pool. I’m a pretty active and outdoorsy person, so if you’re a man who can pitch a tent, build a fire, chop wood (yum) we will definitely get on. I also love the gym, but if isn’t your idea of fun, that’s okay, just as long as you’re healthy and in good shape overall. I plan on living a long time, and I want a big family, so I want a man who I can do that with!

Physically, I’m not super picky, I’m short so most of you reading this will be much taller than me. Pretty much just be put together, hygienic and a decent weight for your height. I do love a nice beard and smile though. I’m blonde, athletic and I can clean up nicely and rock a nice dress when the occasion demands it, but day to day I’m either in gym clothes or comfy clothes. 

Touched on this earlier but I want a big family one day, ideally at least 3-5 kids (hopefully more tbh) so hopefully that’s your dream too. I have a stable career currently but after kids I’d probably prefer to stay home, it’s what my mom did for me, and I think it’s best for kids and everyone else as well. Kids need a consistent parent around. My dream is to move into the country somewhere, with a good school nearby, a good community and nature right at our doorstep. Think a modern homestead type of vibe.

So I think that’s all for now, hope this interests some of you! Send me a chat if so! ♥️",3,1735870512.0,ImpregPersonalsLTR,0,1.0,False

So, that is my plan. But, It occurred to me that Lavazza coffee was founded in Turin which took me on a deep dive the other day.

1hsbi0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hsbi0c/artificial_intelligence_vs_artificial_cognition/,Artificial intelligence vs. artificial cognition.,"There’s a great deal of overlap between the two, but one thing I think more people need to be discussing is distinction between the two and how that impacts our development of AI. 

Intelligence is the capacity to reason, solve problems, and adapt to new situations, reflecting an overarching ability to process and apply information effectively. In contrast, cognition refers to the mental processes involved in activities like reasoning, decision-making, memory, and perception. While intelligence describes the broader potential for performing these tasks, cognition encompasses the specific mechanisms and operations that enable reasoning and decision-making to occur. Essentially, intelligence is the “ability to think,” while cognition is “how thinking happens.”

Basically, we risk overlooking some of the more fundamental aspects of how we think focusing primarily on intelligence. Things that are sometimes orthogonal to intelligence. Consider proprioception - we develop a sense of body position and movement before we’re even capable of reasoning in ways that can be verbalized, and this sense is central to performing rudimentary tasks that are difficult to mimic with machine learning. It’s something that’s so second nature that most people don’t even realize that it’s one of the senses.

It mostly just raises questions about how we’re going to accomplish what we’re hoping to do. Outright replacing a neurosurgeon is harder than people realize not because it’s hard to develop algorithms that reason the way we do, but because in a physical, rather than virtual, world we rely on other aspects of cognition to actually express that reasoning. Replicating the fine motor control necessary to make a cup of coffee, much less wield a scalpel is currently more challenging than everything we’ve done with LLMs thus far.

The question that comes to my mind is if we’re really looking at creating roles in the short and mid term as opposed to replacing people in roles. We don’t necessarily have to replicate the manner in which humans do things, it’ll be sufficient to build systems that can match (or exceed) the outcome. 

AGI is a different beast than automation because logical reasoning often takes on the role of a coach and/or commentator in general decision making. Think about the heavy lifting the brain is doing when you go about your day to day when it comes to say, maintaining a sense of spatial awareness and object permanence. It’ll be interesting to see how we implement these aspects of cognition as AI develops to not just think, but inhabit environments designed for humans.

1hsbd7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1hsbd7h/my_boyfriends_crazy_roommates/,My boyfriends crazy roommate(s),"My boyfriend (28m) has two roommates who both have their “quirks” but one is absolutely terrible. She is unhinged, messy, loud, and much more. He was originally meant to rent a room in a house with a couple, but days before moving in they broke up and the ex-boyfriend moved out leaving just the woman. So immediately he got drawn into all of her drama and post breakup emotions etc. He tried to help and be supportive and chalked up a lot of the red flags to her going through a difficult time. However it became clear very quickly that was not the case, and she is just very unstable. 

One of the main reasons her ex broke up with her is because of her messiness. The entire house is filled with her clutter. Dirty dishes on the coffee table and couch. Personal items such as jewelry, nail clippers, hair brush etc all live on the coffee table or couch. No one can spend any time in the shared spaces because her stuff is everywhere. In order to sit on the couch you have to move her stuff out of the way. She spends all day in the living room as well, just couch rotting and preventing anyone else from utilizing the shared space. She has two cats, one of which gets into everything (trash, food on the counter, toilet in the bathroom) and she doesn’t clean up after it or apologize for any of it. We bought bagels one day and had the bag on the counter. Within 30 minutes we returned to the bag torn open and bites taken out of the bagels. She essentially told us “yeah well you know that’s just cat, he’s a little shit”. No offer to replace the bagels or even help clean the mess. With how messy she is I feel unclean just spending time around there. The only place I am comfortable is in my boyfriend’s bedroom, away from anything she is involved in. I refuse to walk in the house barefoot because I will be stepping in who knows what, anytime I am barefoot I have to wipe my feet of dirt and debris every few steps. She didn’t own any sort of vacuum or broom or anything prior to my boyfriend moving in. But still doesn’t use any of it. 

She spends all day in the living room watching the tv and talking on the phone. She takes all of her calls on speaker phone and is extremely loud. I’m not joking, her volume is excessive. When I am on the phone with my boyfriend and he is in his room with the door shut and ear buds in I can hear her clear as day. And not just hear her, it actually hurts my ears and is louder than my boyfriend himself who is talking in the phone directly. Half the time she is literally screaming. I kid you not, when she is upset or going through an “episode” she will call anyone and everyone and scream rant to them. 

She is in her mid 30’s and works seasonal part time and refuses to work more than 3 days a week. Yet she always complains about not having money. Her parents are co-signed on the lease for her and have been covering her rent. Meanwhile she orders food to be delivered 3-4 times a day. She told us that she is 10K in debt mostly due to food delivery. She blew up on her mom and called her all sort of terrible things and said she doesn’t want her in her life… but then relies on her to pay her rent. 

She started online group therapy which requires her to be in a virtual video call for hours at a time multiple times a week. Which is great, except for the fact she again does this in the living room. This makes it very uncomfortable to be anywhere other than in the bedroom. They have a very small house and you can’t be anywhere without being in the background of her video call. Which I also feel is inconsiderate of the others in the group therapy session. 

As I mentioned, she had basically taken control of the living room. Which is especially annoying due to the fact the entire living room set up is my boyfriend’s. It’s his entertainment center, TV, couch, sound system, etc. and he doesn’t even get to use it. Not to mention, she originally said she didn’t want a tv in the living room because “screens give her migraines” but now has the tv on all day everyday. 

We plan to move in together later this year (his lease ends in Aug) but at this point it feels like that can’t come fast enough.",1,1735870064.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

I drink cappuccinos and my spouse drinks mainly straight espresso. We will most likely make 1-2 drinks weekday mornings, and maybe 2-4 on the weekends. Occasionally we will pull more when entertaining. We’re coffee enthusiasts and already have a good grinder. 

I’ve narrowed down potential machines. I’m only interested in either single boiler or double boiler. No heat exchangers or thermal blocks. I’m torn between the Profitec Go, Bellezza Bellona, and Breville Dual Boiler. They all have the features I’m looking for. They’re also very close in price range. Looks wise, I’d say Profitec Go and Bellezza Bellona look better than the BDB. For my use case, which machine would you recommend? 

I have considered other machines like the Rancillio Silvia Pro X and Lelit Elizabeth but neither of these machines is particularly appealing to me. I don’t like their looks and from looking at lots of reviews and people’s use experience on here, they don’t seem like a good fit for me. I’m also not interested in a cheaper model like the Bambino or one of the Brevilles with a grinder attached.

Is there any other machine you’d recommend for my use case? Steam power, temp stability, and reliability/build quality are important to me. I’m looking for a machine that will last years with routine maintenance.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1hsaszh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1hsaszh/medium_rare_or_medium_despair/,“Medium Rare Or Medium Despair”,"Steak. Just the word conjures images of sizzling grills, smoky aromas, and the primal satisfaction of carnivorous indulgence. Yet, despite its seemingly straightforward nature, cooking steak is like navigating a minefield blindfolded. Sure, it’s just a slab of meat, but treat it wrong, and you’ve got yourself a crime scene rather than a culinary triumph. Steak isn’t cheap, so when you mess it up, it’s not just dinner that suffers — it’s your soul, your wallet, and possibly your reputation.

Purists would have you believe that a perfectly good steak is ruined the moment you start *doing things* to it. Marinades? Sacrilege. Over-salting? Barbaric. And let’s not even get started on well-done steaks. They’ll clutch their pearls (and meat thermometers) in horror at the very suggestion. For them, a good-quality cut of steak — think ribeye or filet mignon — should be treated with the same reverence you’d afford a priceless artifact. A hot grill, a quick sear, and voila — meat nirvana. But here’s the thing — most of us aren’t buying steaks that could moonlight as museum pieces. No, we’re living in the world of chuck roast, sirloin, and whatever’s on sale at the butcher’s counter. And that requires strategy.

Cooking steak is the culinary equivalent of office politics. You need finesse, timing, and a complete understanding of the playing field. High-quality steaks are like the boss’s pet projects — minimal effort, maximum praise. Cheap cuts, on the other hand, are the long-overdue reports you inherited from Carl in accounting — unforgiving, complicated, and requiring a slow, methodical approach if you want anything remotely edible at the end. So, yes, steak is tricky. And because of that, many home cooks err on the side of caution, overcooking it into the leathery abyss. It’s understandable, but also tragic.

Consider some of the common mistakes — because there are plenty. Mistakes that could take your steak night from Michelin aspirations to microwave mediocrity in minutes. For starters, let’s address temperature. Some of you are so afraid of undercooking your steak that you cook it to the consistency of a well-worn hiking boot. Invest in a meat thermometer. It’s not just for turkey, I promise.

Then there’s the issue of seasoning. Overzealous seasoning is like that one coworker who “helps” too much and ends up derailing the entire project. Sure, salt is your friend, but don’t go turning your steak into a salt lick for the neighborhood deer. On the flip side, under-seasoning is equally offensive. A sprinkle of salt and pepper isn’t going to cut it. You’re not “letting the meat shine” — you’re serving bland sadness on a plate.

Another classic misstep? Improper searing. A steak without a proper sear is like a meeting without an agenda — pointless and disappointing. You need a screaming hot pan or grill, and no, “screaming hot” doesn’t mean “medium heat because I’m scared of smoke.” Commit. You want that golden, caramelized crust. That’s flavor, people.

Let’s not forget the resting period. Oh, you didn’t let your steak rest after cooking? Congratulations, you’ve just released all its precious juices onto the cutting board. It’s like pouring out your morning coffee before the caffeine kicks in — utterly senseless. Give it a rest. Literally.

And for the love of all things edible, stop stabbing your steak with a fork to check if it’s done. Do you know what that does? It creates holes for all the juices to escape. You’re not conducting a steak autopsy, you’re making dinner.

Marinating your steak? Proceed with caution. Some cuts — your chucks and flanks — thrive on a good soak in marinade. But if you’re bathing your ribeye in a mix of soy sauce and honey, stop. Just stop. It’s like giving a Ferrari a paint job with a roller brush.

Also, can we talk about slicing? Cutting your steak against the grain isn’t just some chef-y jargon, it’s the difference between tender bites and chewing gum. You wouldn’t read a report backward and expect it to make sense, so don’t slice your steak the wrong way.

Steak, at its best, is a power move. It’s impressive, satisfying, and worth the effort. But it’s also a lesson in humility, because when you mess it up, there’s no hiding it. Your dinner guests won’t politely ignore a gray, chewy disaster on their plates. They’ll remember. Forever.

So, next time you fire up the grill or heat that pan, remember that steak is an art form, not a free-for-all. Respect it. Season it. Cook it properly. And for goodness’ sake, let it rest. Or just order takeout and save yourself the existential crisis.

My issue is that there is SO much conflicting information about what supplements I can take and when and what to eat or not eat with/around these times, and after getting recent labs done and learning that I now have pernicious anemia, too, I guess I’ve been going about it all wrong.

FYI: I’m not celiac (unless silent but I have great digestion), and I LOVE my cream, dairy, and cheese. I’ve only just learned not to have these with Iron, and giving them up for breakfast has been hard but I’m doing well for the past couple weeks having tea and dairy in the afternoon instead. (I DO know to have my Levo by itself with nothing else). 

Here’s my daily plan, but I need advice to help me figure out when to take everything else, or correct me if I’m wrong. 

7:30/8am (first thing): Levothyroxine and Selenium with water and nothing else

10/10:30am: Iron 325 mg and 250mg Vit C - WITH breakfast but NO caffeine or dairy

1/1:30 - lunch  

3:30/4pm - coffee or tea and light snack

Dinner (8:30) - dairy, carbs whatever

I got my Ninja Luxe a week ago and I do love it because I really do not know a lot about coffee, just that I love to drink it, and it helps take out the guesswork.
However I do have three questions:
1. When I first used the frother the thick froth came out perfect. Now when I use it, it seems to mostly pour just milk in my cup. Not sure if it’s something others are experiencing or if I am doing something wrong? I am using whole milk (I do prefer almond or oat in my coffee but I figured whole is best for frothing purposes).
2. After brewing multiple cups of espresso, I still find a bitter taste. At first I thought it was just the Starbucks dark roast that I didn’t like, so I switched it out for a medium roast from LavAzza. And there’s still just something off about it. I am looking for a local roaster. Not sure if I have to recalibrate the machine when changing beans or what.
3. It asks me to rinse if I do hot to cold. Which I understand but nothing in the manual is telling me how to rinse!

I had them on one that I have a tendency to post details of my life and what I’m up to, but moved them to one that’s more casual and irregular. I’ve known these people since we were in our early teens, as we were part of the same clubs in school. Over the years, I’ve grown apart from them and a level of distrust has built due to things they’ve done and said. Back in 2023, I moved from where we grew up in Devon across to the outskirts of London for work. The 3 of them work small part time jobs, and the 4th is unemployed. I’ve made the effort to try and maintain a friendship with them, but trying to socialise with them always leaves me feeling almost like an outsider within the group, or they belittle me. I’ve been more successful than them in terms of my occupation, and since I moved away I’ve made better friends and have felt happier than ever before. A week ago, I moved the 4 of them off my account as I felt rather unhappy having them able to see what I was up to, as I know for a fact they’re all connected and friendly with a group of people who made life in Devon a living hell. Just before the new year, the 4 of them began messaging me in a group chat furious at me for doing so, saying how unreasonable and unfair I was for doing this, and how rude and distasteful I was. I’d explained my reasoning for it not feeling right due to the nature of our lack of conversation and the way they treat me, but I gave in and moved them back across as I felt guilty. Earlier on today, I met up with them for coffee, and they took every chance to bring me down with unfair and unpleasant comments, and they kept targeting back with several comments about my intelligence level (I’m a university graduate, finishing school with straight As in my GCSEs, 2 of them are high school dropouts, 1 finished high school with low letter GCSEs, and the 4th completed 1 year of college). They also like to fire comments about my past trauma that caused huge difficulty for me in 2019 and 2020, treating it as a joke even though I’ve asked them not to. 

Was I in the wrong for trying to see less of them, and have them know less of me?

The problem is, I can't relate to a lot of other reformed dudes. I don't want a massive library of leather bound books and shelves of rich mahogany. I don't care about -lapsarianism or Thomas Aquinas. I don't really want to go do a ""men's study"" and sit in a male therapy circle and talk about what failures we are as husbands and fathers.

Anyway, kind of a rant, but I just spent a year (I moved) at a non-denominational, calvinist church, missing hymns, feeling slightly guilty because they were not RP (though they were great and I don't regret my time there), because I would have rather been there with a group of guys who seemed ""normal"", than the reformed church down the road with dudes who collect beard oils, cigars, and have a different craftsman leather bible for each of their different varieties of scotch.

I was born, raised, still living in western countries. I love my faith. But I stuggle with my perception as a muslim. 

I don't wear a hijab. I hang out with non muslims all the time and go out to bars, but I don't drink. I post photos of us out and people might infer things that are not the case. But I also... (I'm ashamed to admit this) kind of want people to see me be ""normal"". It feels like a loophole. I am not sinning in drinking etc. but people can see me as someone who still goes out and has a good time. I go to the work christmas party. I don't believe in Christmas religiously, but I have fun at the party.

My issue is when I feel more faithful, I am ashamed that muslims In my life probably perceive me to not be a good muslimah. But I also want to be friends with muslims too. I just am not muslim enough for them, and not quite white enough for the westerners. 

I don't correct people if they don't assume I'm muslim, and I don't tell unless I need to. It's scary out here now, with islamaphobia etc. I keep my faith close to me and I feel guilty for it, for allowing people to think I'm someone I'm not.

And I don't know how to fix it after I let it go on so long. ie. A girl I hung out with yesterday thought I was drinking (I had a mocktail) and I didn't correct her. Now it would be awkward to. But now she thinks I'm something I'm not and I feel ashamed. Because I don't sin like that.

  
Or at the Christmas party the lady that invited me asked me if I wanted pork and I said I don't like it and don't eat it. But I didn't say it's becuase I'm muslim. Later on we were talking about bacon and I eat turkey bacon but I didn't specify. She sees me with a mocktail and probably assumes it's booze but it's not. But it has gone on so long I feel it's weird to explain to her since it will seem like I was lying about myself. I tried to say ""you should come to our eid dinner!"" as a sideways way of bringing it up and she said ""sure!"" but seemed very confused. She is someone I see alot so I feel the need to clear it up but it's also scary. 

  
At the same time it goes in the reverse. The muslim girlies probably think I am so far gone too if they see me having coffee with a guy friend etc.

  
God this is awkward and exausting. This is why the quran says ""Whoever *imitates* a people is one of them"" I guess.

But hey, at least we’re toasty. If your plan succeeds, you might spare us from a future where the mere act of powering up an AI involves rolling blackouts in three time zones. Picture an alert every time your LLM logs on: ‘Attention, entire grid down—reboot scheduled for Q4.’ That’s not exactly a crowd-pleaser.

## Breville BES870XL Barista Express Espresso Machine: Troubleshooting & FAQs

The Breville BES870XL Barista Express is a popular choice for home baristas, offering a blend of convenience and quality espresso.  However, like any complex machine, it can occasionally present challenges. This comprehensive guide addresses common issues, provides detailed setup instructions, and answers frequently asked questions to help you get the most out of your BES870XL.

### Setting Up Your Breville BES870XL Barista Express

Getting started with your BES870XL is straightforward, but a proper setup ensures optimal performance from the outset.

#### Unboxing and Initial Setup (Breville BES870XL Espresso Machine Setup)

1. **Carefully unpack:**  Remove all components from the box. Refer to your included Breville BES870XL manual download for a complete parts list.
2. **Placement:** Position the machine on a stable, level surface near a power outlet and water source.
3. **Water Reservoir:** Fill the reservoir with fresh, cold water.  Use filtered water if possible to minimize mineral buildup and extend the life of your machine.
4. **Drip Tray:** Insert the drip tray and ensure it's correctly positioned.
5. **Power Connection:** Plug the machine into a grounded power outlet.
6. **Initial Run:** Turn the machine on and allow it to heat up.  You may hear some initial noises as the system primes.

#### First Use and Basic Operations

1. **Grinding:** Fill the hopper with your favorite espresso beans. Adjust the grind size according to the manufacturer's recommendations and your bean type.  A finer grind is generally needed for espresso.
2. **Dosing:**  Use the provided scoop to measure your coffee grounds.  A consistent dose is crucial for consistent results.
3. **Tamping:** Firmly tamp the grounds in the portafilter, ensuring even distribution.  Over-tamping or uneven tamping can lead to channeling and inconsistent extraction.
4. **Brewing:** Lock the portafilter into the group head and select your desired shot size.
5. **Milk Frothing (Optional):** If using the steam wand, follow the instructions in your manual for frothing milk.  Practice is key to mastering milk texture.

**Tips for Adjusting Grind Settings and Tamping:** Experiment with different grind settings to find the optimal setting for your beans.  A consistent tamp pressure (around 30 lbs is generally recommended) is crucial for even extraction.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues (Breville BES870XL Troubleshooting Guide)

#### Low Water Pressure

Low water pressure is a common problem. Here's a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

1. **Check and Clean the Water Filter:** A clogged filter restricts water flow.  Replace or clean the filter according to the instructions in your manual.
2. **Inspect and Clean the Flowmeter and Water-Debris Filter:** Mineral deposits and coffee grounds can build up in these components.  Clean them carefully using a soft brush and rinse thoroughly.
3. **Reset Water Volume Settings:**  Incorrect water volume settings can affect pressure. Consult your Breville BES870XL manual for instructions on resetting these settings.
4. **Descale the Machine:** Limescale buildup is a common cause of low water pressure.  Regular descaling is crucial (see maintenance section below).
5. **Check for Blockages in the Hydraulic Pathway:** Examine the pathways for any obstructions.  If you find blockages, carefully remove them.  Refer to your manual or online resources for diagrams of the internal components.


#### Steam Wand Issues

1. **Cleaning the Steam Wand:** Regularly clean the steam wand after each use to prevent milk buildup and ensure proper function. Wipe it down with a damp cloth.
2. **Rebuilding the Steam Wand (if necessary):** If the steam wand malfunctions despite cleaning, it may require professional repair or replacement.


#### Group Head Issues

1. **Inspecting and Cleaning the Group Head:**  The group head should be regularly cleaned to remove coffee residue.  Use a group head brush and cleaning solution as recommended by Breville.
2. **Rebuilding the Group Head (if necessary):**  If the group head is damaged, professional repair or replacement might be required.


#### Pump Issues

1. **Understanding Pump Functions and Common Problems:** The pump is the heart of the machine.  Problems can range from low pressure to complete failure.

It’s easy to dream big, but let’s be honest—your vision has to be practical! Before you go all-in on a grand idea, ask yourself: Is it something I can actually pull off with the resources I have?

🚫 **Avoid these dreamy, unrealistic visions (they sound great, but they’re not practical):**

* ""We’ll serve every type of cuisine from every country worldwide.""
* ""We’ll be open 24/7, offering gourmet meals with live music and personalised service.""
* ""We’ll let customers customise every dish with locally sourced ingredients.""

These sound amazing, right? But they’re not sustainable or realistic for most cafe businesses.

✅ **Better, more realistic vision examples:**

* ""To run a vibrant cafe offering artisanal coffee and gourmet food, focusing on efficiency and profitability.""
* ""To open a cozy neighbourhood cafe offering a diverse menu for various dietary needs, with exceptional service.""
* ""To create a community-focused cafe serving locally sourced coffee and seasonal dishes in a welcoming environment.""



# Step 2: Create Your Own Vision Statement

Now, it’s your turn! Use these “vision filters” to ensure your vision is grounded in reality:

* **Market Need** – Is there demand for what you're offering?
* **Competition** – Who’s already out there, and what sets you apart?
* **Demographics** – Who’s your target audience, and what do they need?
* **Location** – Is your location ideal for attracting your target market?
* **Financial Feasibility** – Will your business be profitable long-term?
* **Operational Practicality** – Can you actually make this work in practice?

Here’s an example using those filters:

*""To become the preferred local cafe offering high-quality, locally sourced coffee and quick-serve food. Located in a bustling urban area, our cafe caters to students and professionals. Research shows a demand for artisanal products with rapid service—unlike the mass-produced options from local competitors. By streamlining our operations with a simplified menu and focusing on local sourcing, we’ll provide a unique experience while ensuring profitability.""*

This vision addresses real market needs, competition, and practical operations—plus, it’s backed by research.



# Step 3: Refine & Revisit Your Vision

Your vision statement isn’t set in stone. Revisit it regularly (at least once a year) to make sure it’s still aligned with your goals. The cafe industry is always evolving, so it’s important to stay flexible and make adjustments when necessary!



**TL;DR:** Crafting a realistic vision for your cafe is key to long-term success. Balance passion with practicality by using the Vision Statement Filters to keep things grounded in reality. Don’t forget to review and adjust your vision regularly!",1,1735866290.0,cafestartupsau,0,1.0,False

Starting a cafe isn’t a walk in the park, and every cafe owner (or aspiring one) has likely faced some of these struggles. The good news? You don’t have to go through it alone. At Clever Cafe, we’ve worked with plenty of startups to help them overcome the same issues you're facing—and we’ve seen how market research can make all the difference. Let’s dive into some of the most common cafe hurdles and how you can tackle them head-on.

**1. Customer Spending Ceiling 💸**

As much as people love their daily coffee, there’s a limit to what they’re willing to spend. How do you know when you’ve hit that ceiling? Market research helps you understand what your customers value and are willing to pay for, so you can price your menu right.

*Tip: Use surveys and feedback to learn what your customers want without the guesswork.*

**2. High Operational Costs 💡**

From rent to wages, operational costs can drain your resources fast. But with market research, you can figure out where to cut back without sacrificing quality.

*Tip: Look into supplier costs and seasonal trends. Small adjustments here can save you big in the long run.*

**3. Staff Retention 👩‍🍳👨‍🍳**

Finding and keeping good staff can be one of the hardest parts of running a cafe. But the right tools (like training and employee satisfaction surveys) can go a long way toward boosting morale and retention.

*Tip: Regular feedback sessions with your team can help keep them motivated and reduce turnover.*

**4. Time Management ⏰**

Running a cafe means you’re juggling a million tasks at once. But don’t burn yourself out—there are tools that can streamline operations, from inventory management to employee scheduling.

*Tip: Implement systems to save time and increase efficiency—let the tech do the work.*

**5. Reinvestment Needs 💰**

It’s crucial to reinvest in your business regularly, but it’s easy to feel lost on where to put your money. Market research can help you figure out which upgrades and changes will have the biggest impact on growth.

*Tip: Focus on improvements that directly enhance the customer experience (upgraded seating, better lighting, etc.).*

**6. Navigating Compliance 📑**

Food safety, health codes, and legal regulations are no joke, especially when you're new. Having a compliance checklist and expert advice will save you from unnecessary headaches.

*Tip: Stay on top of local food safety standards to avoid costly mistakes.*

**7. Thin Margins 💵**

The margins in the cafe business can be razor-thin. The good news? Market research can help you optimize pricing and improve your menu, increasing your profitability without losing customers.

*Tip: Experiment with your menu prices based on customer behavior data to find the sweet spot.*

**8. Market Saturation 🏙️**

With so many cafes in the market, standing out is tough. But with competitive analysis, you can spot gaps in the market and position your cafe to fill a need.

*Tip: Check out local competitors to see where they’re lacking, and then offer something they don’t.*

**9. Seasonal Fluctuations 🌦️**

Sales can fluctuate with the seasons, but knowing when the slow periods will hit can help you plan accordingly. Use market research to identify trends and plan special promotions for those slower months.

*Tip: Offer seasonal specials or loyalty programs to keep customers coming back, even when it’s slow.*

**10. Building Customer Loyalty 💖**

Great coffee is just the start. Creating loyal customers takes consistency and a personalized touch. Market research helps you understand what keeps people coming back and how to improve your relationships with them.

*Tip: Loyalty programs, along with regular feedback, can help create lasting customer connections.*



**How Clever Cafe Can Help:** At Clever Cafe, we provide startups with the tools and strategies to navigate these common challenges. From market research and pricing strategies to employee retention techniques, we’re here to guide you every step of the way.

We’ve helped countless cafes thrive, and we know market research is a game-changer. Don’t let these challenges stop you from reaching your goals. Let’s keep learning, growing, and thriving together!

1hs9ysg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs9ysg,Dry Tortugas Deep Dive,"Hello!  Lots of posts here about Dry Tortugas so I won’t reiterate the usual advice (planning early for tickets) that y’all have heard ad nauseum.  But I wanted to cover some things not normally discussed that I learned / experienced today on my trip.  In the case of my visit, I got a seat on the Yankee Freedom III on standby.  

STANDBY PROCESS: 
- If you didn’t get tickets beforehand you really must show up as early as you can tolerate.  I arrived at roughly 0358 and there was already a party of 4 in line for standby.  They got there at 1230 in the morning because the previous day they’d arrived at 0200 and 8 people were already in line, and they didn’t get in on standby.  
- Only one person in your party needs to show up to wait in line for the standby list, but all members of your party must be present no later than 0745 (ideally 0730) to secure your seats if you get seats.  
- I’ve attached pictures of where to go to wait for standby.  Go up the white stairs at the terminal and sit in the benches in order of arrival.  Someone will come unlock the terminal doors around 0600-0615ish to bring out the list no later than 0630.  Please note … the bathrooms will be inaccessible until they unlock these doors so plan accordingly.   
- Our standby list was put out ~0615, we signed in order of arrival.  Once it’s signed you’re free to leave the terminal if you like; most people did, seems like most also went to go get breakfast and coffee.  
- There’s a good place within walking distance for breakfast/coffee called Cuban Coffee Queen, you can order online before they open at 0630 and pick up at 0700.  Be advised if you get lucky and get in on standby, you will be served breakfast onboard, but it’s mostly continent style food items (more below).  
- They asked us to return at 0730 for the standby process.  Likelihood of getting selected seems extremely variable and unpredictable.  I saw tons of posts here saying up to 17 people got in on standby, whereas an employee told me this morning that the previous day had 0 people get in on standby because miraculously all the ticket holders showed up.  We were second in line, party of 2, and got in.  Roughly 12 people got in.  
- If you get in on standby you will purchase tickets at the front desk immediately inside the terminal.  Pricing online.  Both cash & cards accepted.  Have ID.  

YANKEE FREEDOM TIPS & INFO:
- Seas can be rough, especially in colder months.  Advise taking Less Drowsy Dramamine an hour before getting underway if you have any inkling toward motion sickness.  If you forget to get some they do have it available for purchase in the galley on the main deck.  They also have ginger ale available.  
- In terms of packing (for day trippers), less is more.  You have to carry everything with you off-ship upon arrival to the park and cart it around the fort (or leave it somewhere unattended).  Snorkeling gear is provided (included in ticket price), but towels, bathing suits, sunscreen, etc., is not.  
- General itinerary is as follows:  depart at 0800, arrive at DTNP 1030, tour (optional) begins at 1100, lunch served onboard from 1100-1300, onboard bar opens at 1300, return to the boat no later than 1445, departure at 1500, arrive back to Key West at 1730.  
- Breakfast items were:  bagels, cream cheese, cereals, milk, juice, fruit, yogurt, coffee.  Lunch was a sandwich, chips (Lays original or pretzels), cookies (not sure what kind they were), and a canned soda (Pepsi products); the sandwiches were either turkey, ham, or roast beef, condiments available in packets.  Not sure what vegan or vegetarian options were provided.  The available alcoholic drinks were wine, High Noon vodka seltzers, beer, and frozen drinks like frozen margaritas, rum runners, and strawberry daiquiri.  If you have concerns about water while in the park, I would advise bringing refillable water bottles!  They have a fresh water tap on the boat you can use to refill them and this will be easier to carry than a bunch of single-use water bottles.  
- A 20-minute “talk” and a follow-on 60-minute tour will be offered to passengers (both included in ticket price) upon disembarkation.  The talk is a general / brief historical overview of Fort Jefferson.  The tour is a walk around the fort with your guide, covering various military topics and also some interesting history about the prisoners of the fort.  Highly recommend it to anyone interested in general geopolitical or military history!  It was very informative and very entertaining.  

OTHER RANDOM STUFF:
- The Visitor Center in at the fort, to your immediate right as you walk across the moat.  They have the usual stuff (t-shirts, magnets, coffee cups, stamps).  Cash & card accepted. 
- Winter months are apparently less than ideal for snorkeling (cold, cloudy water with bad visibility).  If you want to snorkel advise looking for a summer booking.   
- If you’re from a warm country / state, I advise bringing warm outer wear for winter visits!  The sun was warm but the breeze was very cold, I wore a hoodie for the majority of my visit.

1hs9xh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/habitjournal/comments/1hs9xh6/how_habits_shape_our_lives/,How Habits Shape Our Lives,"Did you know that nearly half of our daily actions are driven by habits ^(1)? These often-unconscious routines and behaviors we perform regularly play a far more significant role in shaping our lives than we might realize. From the mundane, like brushing our teeth, to the complex, like navigating social situations, habits influence our actions, decisions, and overall well-being. Understanding the science behind habit formation can empower us to cultivate positive habits and break free from negative ones, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful life.

# The Science of Habit Formation

Habits are formed through a fascinating interplay of neurological processes, psychological factors, and environmental cues ^(2). Research suggests that habit formation is an evolutionary adaptation, allowing our brains to conserve energy by automating frequently performed actions. This automation frees up cognitive resources for more complex tasks and decision-making ^(3).

# The Habit Loop

One of the key discoveries in the field of habit formation is the concept of the ""habit loop,"" a three-step process that underlies the development and maintenance of habits ^(4). This loop consists of:

1. **Cue:** A trigger that initiates the habit. This could be a specific time of day, a location, a preceding action, or even an emotional state.
2. **Routine:** The behavior itself, which can be physical, mental, or emotional.
3. **Reward:** The positive reinforcement that strengthens the habit. This could be a tangible reward, like a treat, or an internal reward, like a feeling of accomplishment or satisfaction.

Through repetition, the connection between the cue and the reward becomes stronger, and the routine becomes increasingly automatic. This process occurs in the basal ganglia, a brain region associated with emotions, memories, and pattern recognition ^(4). When practicing a habitual routine, such as brushing one's teeth, certain neurons in the basal ganglia will activate or “fire” at the beginning and end of the routine, signaling the start and stop of the activity ^(5). While the basal ganglia plays a crucial role in habit formation, other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, are also involved ^(3). The prefrontal cortex is responsible for conscious decision-making and planning, and it interacts with the basal ganglia to help select and initiate habitual behaviors.

# Factors Influencing Habit Formation

While the habit loop provides a basic framework for understanding habit formation, several factors can influence the strength and persistence of habits:

* **Frequency and Consistency:** The more frequently and consistently a behavior is performed in a specific context, the stronger the habit becomes ^(2). Research has shown that behavior is likely to become habitual when it is frequently and consistently performed in the same context ^(2). For example, when one frequently and consistently eats vegetables for lunch, at some point eating vegetables for lunch will become a habit. This is because the frequent co-occurrence of context and behavior instigates an association that may guide future behavior ^(2).
* **Reward:** Habits associated with immediate and consistent rewards are more likely to stick ^(3). Timing is important for making good behavior stick. The rewards for habit formation need to be immediate because dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in reinforcing behaviors in the brain's reward pathway, operates on a time frame of seconds ^(3).
* **Effort:** Habits that require less effort to perform are easier to maintain.
* **Context:** Stable environmental cues and contexts facilitate habit formation.

Interestingly, the habit formation process within individuals unfolds asymptotically ^(2). That is, habit strength increases steeply at first, and then levels off.

# The Impact of Habits on Our Lives

Habits exert a profound influence on various aspects of our lives:

# Behavior and Decision-Making

Habits shape our behavior by automating responses to specific cues. This can be beneficial when the habit is positive, such as automatically exercising every morning. However, it can be detrimental when the habit is negative, such as automatically reaching for a sugary snack when stressed. Habits can compensate for dips in the strength of positive intentions ^(6). For example, a runner may go for their morning run out of habit, despite poor weather having weakened their running intentions ^(6). Habit can also lead people to act contrary to intentions. For example, after the 2007 smoking ban in UK public houses, many smokers reported finding themselves lighting a cigarette as an unintentional habitual response to drinking alcohol ^(6).

Habits also influence our decision-making by shaping our preferences and biases. We tend to favor options that are familiar and require less cognitive effort, often leading us to make choices that align with our existing habits ^(7). When we are faced with a decision, we select a possible option based on the values that we associate with each. One way that we may decide an option is of value is if it is habitual ^(7).

# Well-being

Habits have a significant impact on our physical and mental well-being. Healthy habits, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep, contribute to physical health, reduce stress, and improve mood ^(8). Conversely, unhealthy habits, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and sedentary behavior, can lead to various health problems and decreased well-being. Our behaviors don't just impact our physical health, they affect our mental well-being, too ^(9). Healthy habits are important since they provide us with the structure needed to orient ourselves in a productive and positive way — motivating us to move forward ^(9).

# Goal Achievement

Habits can be powerful tools for achieving goals. By breaking down large goals into smaller, habitual actions, we can make consistent progress without relying solely on motivation or willpower ^(2). For example, instead of aiming to write a book, we can establish a habit of writing for 30 minutes each day. Forming good habits is a key strategy for overcoming short-term goals that conflict with long-term goals ^(2).

# Relationships

Our habits also affect our relationships with others. Positive habits, such as active listening, expressing gratitude, and being punctual, can strengthen our connections with others. On the other hand, negative habits, such as interrupting, gossiping, or being consistently late, can strain relationships ^(10).

# Self-Control

Habits can contribute to effortless self-control ^(6). By automating healthy behaviors, we reduce the need for conscious effort and willpower, making it easier to resist temptations and maintain self-discipline.

# Financial Well-being

Habits can also impact our financial well-being. Good habits, such as budgeting, saving, and investing wisely, can lead to financial stability and security. On the other hand, bad habits, such as impulse buying, overspending, and neglecting financial planning, can lead to debt and financial stress ^(10).

# Potential Downsides of Healthy Habits

While healthy habits are generally beneficial, it's important to be aware of their potential downsides. In some cases, rigid adherence to routines can lead to inflexibility and difficulty adapting to changing circumstances ^(9). It's essential to maintain a balance between structure and flexibility, allowing for adjustments when needed.

# Cultivating Positive Habits

Forming new habits can be challenging, but understanding the science behind habit formation can make the process more manageable. Here are some strategies for cultivating positive habits:

* **Start Small:** Begin with small, achievable changes to avoid feeling overwhelmed. For example, start by drinking one extra glass of water each day or taking a 5-minute walk during your lunch break.
* **Focus on Consistency:** Aim for consistency rather than intensity. It's better to perform a small action consistently than a large action sporadically.
* **Create a Cue:** Identify a specific cue that will trigger the habit. This could be a time of day, a location, or a preceding action. For instance, you could decide to meditate for 10 minutes every morning after you brush your teeth.
* **Reward Yourself:** Associate the habit with a positive reward, either internal or external. This could be a sense of accomplishment, a healthy treat, or a relaxing activity.
* **Be Patient:** Habit formation takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately. It can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months to form a new habit.
* **Reduce Friction:** Identify and remove any obstacles that make it difficult to perform the habit. This could involve simplifying the routine, preparing your environment in advance, or eliminating distractions.
* **Habit Stacking:** Leverage existing habits to form new ones. For example, if you already have a habit of drinking coffee in the morning, you could ""stack"" a new habit of reading for 15 minutes onto it.

# Breaking Bad Habits

Breaking bad habits can be even more challenging than forming new ones. However, it is possible with conscious effort and the right strategies:

* **Identify the Habit Loop:** Understand the cue, routine, and reward that maintain the habit. For example, if you have a habit of snacking on unhealthy foods in the evening, identify the cue (e.g., boredom, stress), the routine (e.g., going to the kitchen and grabbing a bag of chips), and the reward (e.g., the taste of the chips, the feeling of comfort).
* **Disrupt the Cue:** Avoid or modify the cue that triggers the habit. If boredom is the cue for your evening snacking habit, find alternative activities to engage in, such as reading, going for a walk, or spending time with loved ones.
* **Replace the Routine:** Substitute the unwanted behavior with a more desirable one. Instead of reaching for chips, opt for a healthier snack, like fruits or vegetables.
* **Reward Yourself:** Reinforce the new behavior with a positive reward. This could be a sense of accomplishment, a healthy treat, or a relaxing activity.
* **Seek Support:** Enlist the help of friends, family, or a therapist to support your efforts. Having someone to hold you accountable and provide encouragement can make a big difference.

Through repetition, the connection between the cue and the reward becomes stronger, and the routine becomes increasingly automatic. This process occurs in the basal ganglia, a brain region associated with emotions, memories, and pattern recognition ^(4). When practicing a habitual routine, such as brushing one's teeth, certain neurons in the basal ganglia will activate or “fire” at the beginning and end of the routine, signaling the start and stop of the activity ^(5). While the basal ganglia plays a crucial role in habit formation, other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, are also involved ^(3). The prefrontal cortex is responsible for conscious decision-making and planning, and it interacts with the basal ganglia to help select and initiate habitual behaviors.

# Factors Influencing Habit Formation

While the habit loop provides a basic framework for understanding habit formation, several factors can influence the strength and persistence of habits:

* **Frequency and Consistency:** The more frequently and consistently a behavior is performed in a specific context, the stronger the habit becomes ^(2). Research has shown that behavior is likely to become habitual when it is frequently and consistently performed in the same context ^(2). For example, when one frequently and consistently eats vegetables for lunch, at some point eating vegetables for lunch will become a habit. This is because the frequent co-occurrence of context and behavior instigates an association that may guide future behavior ^(2).
* **Reward:** Habits associated with immediate and consistent rewards are more likely to stick ^(3). Timing is important for making good behavior stick. The rewards for habit formation need to be immediate because dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in reinforcing behaviors in the brain's reward pathway, operates on a time frame of seconds ^(3).
* **Effort:** Habits that require less effort to perform are easier to maintain.
* **Context:** Stable environmental cues and contexts facilitate habit formation.

Interestingly, the habit formation process within individuals unfolds asymptotically ^(2). That is, habit strength increases steeply at first, and then levels off.

# The Impact of Habits on Our Lives

Habits exert a profound influence on various aspects of our lives:

# Behavior and Decision-Making

Habits shape our behavior by automating responses to specific cues. This can be beneficial when the habit is positive, such as automatically exercising every morning. However, it can be detrimental when the habit is negative, such as automatically reaching for a sugary snack when stressed. Habits can compensate for dips in the strength of positive intentions ^(6). For example, a runner may go for their morning run out of habit, despite poor weather having weakened their running intentions ^(6). Habit can also lead people to act contrary to intentions. For example, after the 2007 smoking ban in UK public houses, many smokers reported finding themselves lighting a cigarette as an unintentional habitual response to drinking alcohol ^(6).

Habits also influence our decision-making by shaping our preferences and biases. We tend to favor options that are familiar and require less cognitive effort, often leading us to make choices that align with our existing habits ^(7). When we are faced with a decision, we select a possible option based on the values that we associate with each. One way that we may decide an option is of value is if it is habitual ^(7).

# Well-being

Habits have a significant impact on our physical and mental well-being. Healthy habits, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep, contribute to physical health, reduce stress, and improve mood ^(8). Conversely, unhealthy habits, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and sedentary behavior, can lead to various health problems and decreased well-being. Our behaviors don't just impact our physical health, they affect our mental well-being, too ^(9). Healthy habits are important since they provide us with the structure needed to orient ourselves in a productive and positive way — motivating us to move forward ^(9).

# Goal Achievement

Habits can be powerful tools for achieving goals. By breaking down large goals into smaller, habitual actions, we can make consistent progress without relying solely on motivation or willpower ^(2). For example, instead of aiming to write a book, we can establish a habit of writing for 30 minutes each day. Forming good habits is a key strategy for overcoming short-term goals that conflict with long-term goals ^(2).

# Relationships

Our habits also affect our relationships with others. Positive habits, such as active listening, expressing gratitude, and being punctual, can strengthen our connections with others. On the other hand, negative habits, such as interrupting, gossiping, or being consistently late, can strain relationships ^(10).

# Self-Control

Habits can contribute to effortless self-control ^(6). By automating healthy behaviors, we reduce the need for conscious effort and willpower, making it easier to resist temptations and maintain self-discipline.

# Financial Well-being

Habits can also impact our financial well-being. Good habits, such as budgeting, saving, and investing wisely, can lead to financial stability and security. On the other hand, bad habits, such as impulse buying, overspending, and neglecting financial planning, can lead to debt and financial stress ^(10).

# Potential Downsides of Healthy Habits

While healthy habits are generally beneficial, it's important to be aware of their potential downsides. In some cases, rigid adherence to routines can lead to inflexibility and difficulty adapting to changing circumstances ^(9). It's essential to maintain a balance between structure and flexibility, allowing for adjustments when needed.

# Cultivating Positive Habits

Forming new habits can be challenging, but understanding the science behind habit formation can make the process more manageable. Here are some strategies for cultivating positive habits:

* **Start Small:** Begin with small, achievable changes to avoid feeling overwhelmed. For example, start by drinking one extra glass of water each day or taking a 5-minute walk during your lunch break.
* **Focus on Consistency:** Aim for consistency rather than intensity. It's better to perform a small action consistently than a large action sporadically.
* **Create a Cue:** Identify a specific cue that will trigger the habit. This could be a time of day, a location, or a preceding action. For instance, you could decide to meditate for 10 minutes every morning after you brush your teeth.
* **Reward Yourself:** Associate the habit with a positive reward, either internal or external. This could be a sense of accomplishment, a healthy treat, or a relaxing activity.
* **Be Patient:** Habit formation takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately. It can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months to form a new habit.
* **Reduce Friction:** Identify and remove any obstacles that make it difficult to perform the habit. This could involve simplifying the routine, preparing your environment in advance, or eliminating distractions.
* **Habit Stacking:** Leverage existing habits to form new ones. For example, if you already have a habit of drinking coffee in the morning, you could ""stack"" a new habit of reading for 15 minutes onto it.

# Breaking Bad Habits

Breaking bad habits can be even more challenging than forming new ones. However, it is possible with conscious effort and the right strategies:

* **Identify the Habit Loop:** Understand the cue, routine, and reward that maintain the habit. For example, if you have a habit of snacking on unhealthy foods in the evening, identify the cue (e.g., boredom, stress), the routine (e.g., going to the kitchen and grabbing a bag of chips), and the reward (e.g., the taste of the chips, the feeling of comfort).
* **Disrupt the Cue:** Avoid or modify the cue that triggers the habit. If boredom is the cue for your evening snacking habit, find alternative activities to engage in, such as reading, going for a walk, or spending time with loved ones.
* **Replace the Routine:** Substitute the unwanted behavior with a more desirable one. Instead of reaching for chips, opt for a healthier snack, like fruits or vegetables.
* **Reward Yourself:** Reinforce the new behavior with a positive reward. This could be a sense of accomplishment, a healthy treat, or a relaxing activity.
* **Seek Support:** Enlist the help of friends, family, or a therapist to support your efforts. Having someone to hold you accountable and provide encouragement can make a big difference.

# Changing Habits for Better Health

Changing habits is a process that involves several stages and can take a while ^(11). The four stages of changing a health behavior are:

# Conclusion

Habits are powerful forces that shape our lives in profound ways. From our physical and mental well-being to our relationships and financial stability, habits influence our actions, decisions, and overall quality of life. By understanding the science behind habit formation, we can gain greater control over our habits and use them to our advantage. Cultivating positive habits and breaking free from negative ones can lead to improved well-being, increased productivity, and a more fulfilling life. As we become more aware of the habits that drive our behavior, we can make conscious choices to shape our lives in the direction we desire. Remember, excellence is not an act, but a habit.

1hs9sai,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentingThruTrauma/comments/1hs9sai/coffee_on_the_carpet/,Coffee on the Carpet ,"I needed to hide from my family to work through this one. 

This morning I was playing with my 5 year old with his tablet, making marble runs. My 2 year old was watching (mostly because she was jealous he was touching me, and only SHE'S allowed to do that, haha) and squirming around like a 2 year old. 

I ""stupidly"" had brought my cup of iced coffee which I had intended to drink before I was asked to join in play. We recently got the carpet cleaned and my husband is a little paranoid about stains. Well, ""inevitably, because what did I expect setting down an open cup of coffee on the f-ing carpet"" my 2 year old kicked it over. After a gasp and swear, my toddler cries ""uh oh!"" and I whipped around to her, grabbed her face in my hands, pressed my forehead to hers and whispered ""it's ok, accidents happen.""

I then proceeded to clean the shit out of the carpet. I got towels, carpet cleaning spray, and the handheld upholstery cleaner vacuum thing. The whole time all I could say to myself was, ""idiot! Idiot! Idiot!"" while, for the sake of my still watching children, I was trying to remain outwardly positive and efficient. I was trying to organize my feelings because the self-abusive talk was clearly toxic.I realized I was scared, almost panicked, and frantic to clean up the mess quickly and thoroughly enough to look like it had never happened.

As I was scrubbing the damned carpet I began to put together other instances of panicked cleaning. The most significant one is around broken glass which will send me into an absolute spiral. I will sweep, vacuum and literally run my hands over the entire floor so that any glass left will get stuck in me rather than anyone else.  

God damn that's a trauma response if I ever saw one. 

My mom was a ""neat freak"" and often cleaning was hand in hand with anger. She would slam around the house cleaning when she was upset at someone but wouldn't say who or why. She frequently yelled at and punished me for the state of my bedroom. I had undiagnosed ADHD and struggled to keep it tidy to her level of expectation, but she would literally rip open my drawers and scream at me because the clothes were in the drawers, but weren't folded. She often used antiquated cleaning as a punishment (washing clothes with a scrub board, beating rugs outside, etc). She prioritized cleaning and neatness above everything except religion. 

I don't talk to my kids the way I talk to myself. I get frustrated sometimes because their toys are everywhere messy or there are freaking ketchup smears on the door, but if there's an accident I always make an effort to say that it's ok and that accident happen, let's clean it up together. Why can't I be that kind to myself? How do you let go of something you didn't even know you were carrying?

Today was a bit of a struggle. I started the day feeling fine, got some chores done, and enjoyed the morning with my husband.

But around 3 pm, anxiety kicked in at my in-laws' house. I got quiet, cozy, and just wanted to withdraw.

Took my Prozac around 5:30 pm (probably 15mg+), and it helped calm me down. I enjoyed the rest of the evening, despite initial anxiety.

Noticed some apathy and social anxiety, but Prozac helped stabilize my mood but my anxiety/chills hit me when I took Prozac. (I increased the mg today from 10mg to 15mg) I felt a little drugged but not too bad, just more sleepy and chill. Just want to be at the bed lol.

Interestingly, the cloudy and cold weather didn't get me down today. Usually, I'd be moody and gloomy, but today was different.

Prozac made me sleepy at first, but I'm grateful for the calmness it brought.

Time to ask my husband how much Prozac I took today... 15mg might be the new normal!

That's it for today. Sleepy time!

Side effects:
-stomach aches (diarrhea feeling and nausea) I didn’t eat today until now. (7pm)

_Additional Notes_

- Anxiety kicked in at in-laws' house
- Prozac helped calm me down
- Noted apathy and social anxiety
- Weather didn't affect my mood today
- Prozac made me sleepy, but helped with anxiety


WEEK 5- DAY 2

Today was a great day! I woke up feeling normal, which is a wonderful feeling.

My husband and I had a fun outing, buying clothes for him. It was nice to get out and do something together.

No major anxiety or mood swings today, which is a big win! Prozac seems to be doing its job.

Later, we headed to the mountains and I took my 15mg Prozac at 5:30 pm. So far, no side effects!

Mood-wise, I'm experiencing some mild mood swings, but nothing overwhelming.

Feeling grateful for a normal day with my loved one.

Onward to Day 3!

_Additional Notes_

- Woke up feeling normal
- Fun outing with husband
- No major anxiety or mood swings
- 15mg Prozac dose
- No side effects
- Mild mood swings

So, after my lazy morning, the rest of the afternoon was a real challenge, the rain and clouds outside were matching my mood perfectly, gloomy and depressing. We had come to the mountains to ski and have some fun, but the weather had other plans.

I was feeling really down, anxious, and depressed. My husband could see that I was struggling, so he took me out for a walk, and we did some shopping. It was nice to get out and do something, but I was still feeling pretty meh.

As the afternoon wore on, I just wanted to crawl back into bed, and hide under the covers. But then I remembered that I had my trusty Prozac to help me out. Usually, I take it at 6 pm, but today was so bad that I decided to take it at 5 pm instead.

And oh man, it was like a little boost of energy, and happiness! I'm not saying that it magically fixed everything, but it definitely helped take the edge off. I started feeling a bit more positive, and my mood began to lift.

We headed back to the cabin, and I was feeling way more relaxed. My husband, and I just chilled out, watched some TV, and enjoyed each other's company. The dogs were happy, and playful, and it was nice to just unwind, and be together.

As for my anxiety, and depression, I'd say that today was a tough day. But I'm trying not to let it get me down. Tomorrow is a new day, and we're planning to do some more fun activities. Fingers crossed the sun will come out!

I'm also keeping an eye on my side effects. So far, I've been experiencing some headaches, lack of appetite, and a bit of mood swings. But overall, I think the Prozac is worth it. I'm just taking it one day at a time, and seeing how my body adjusts.

As I'm writing this, I'm feeling pretty grateful for my little family, my husband, our dogs, and of course, my Prozac. It's not always easy, but we're in this together.

That's it for tonight, folks. Thanks for tuning in to my daily log. Here's to hoping tomorrow is a brighter day!


*WEEK 5-DAY 4*

Hey guys, happy anniversary to me and my hubby! We're wrapping up our mountain getaway and heading back home. I woke up feeling like a sloth - lazy and sluggish. The cold weather is killing me, and my trusty tooth grind is adding to the fun.

We fueled up on tea (for me) and coffee (for him), and hit the road with our two furry sidekicks. We're a bit sad to leave the mountains, but let's be real, the weather was gloomy and depressing. Everyone up there was feeling down, so we're happy to get back to some sunshine.

We've got a family gathering tonight at 5 pm, so we're heading home early. Currently, we're stuck in traffic (11:25 am), but we should be home around 1 pm. Fingers crossed!

So far, so good - no major side effects from Prozac, and no depression or anxiety symptoms. Just your average, everyday tiredness. I'm dreading unloading the truck, but we'll get it done.

After our mountain adventure, we got back home and organized everything, so we wouldn't have to deal with unloading the truck tomorrow. I spent the rest of the afternoon gaming - because, priorities!

I did manage to squeeze in some food, but my stomach's been feeling weird since I upped my medication. I'm talking lack of appetite, acid reflux, and all that fun stuff. So, I'm taking it slow.

I took my meds around 4:50 pm, and I'm hoping it'll help with this stomach-anxiety mess. We're heading out to hang with the family at 5 pm, and I'm not exactly feeling my best.

As always, my trusty Prozac seems to be helping with the anxiety, but I'm still feeling a bit on edge. I might be overthinking things (shocker!), but we'll see how it goes.

Fingers crossed that tomorrow's a better day, and this is the last week of dealing with these pesky side effects. That's all for today, folks!



*WEEK 5- DAY 5*

So I woke up today at 10:03 am feelin' pretty good, no anxiety or anythin'. But then my head started throbbin' like crazy! I'm talkin' headaches, and I'm not sure what's causin' 'em - Prozac, my teeth, or just my awesome tooth grindin' skills.

As the day went on, the headaches stuck around, and my stomach got all weird. It's like my body's playin' ""Symptom Roulette""!

But I knew I had to take my Prozac. I've been dealin' with anxiety, especially around 5 pm. So I took the full 20mg and just thought, ""fuck it, if I die, I die"" lol.

Took my pill at 4:55 pm and headed to my in-laws for New Year's. And guess what? All my symptoms just disappeared!

It's like magic, right? I'm startin' to think I just need to chill and trust the process... and maybe stop worryin' so much, 'cause it's exhaustin'!

So that's my day! 5 weeks on Prozac and I'm feelin' pretty good….AND bad lol.


*WEEK 5 - DAY-6*

Hey guys, so I'm back with another update on my Prozac journey! Today was day 6 of week 5, and I'm happy to report that it's been a pretty good day.

I woke up feeling like a brand new person... for 10 whole minutes, LOL! Then my brain fog came back, and I was like, ""Oh, hello again, old friend!"" But seriously, I went back to sleep for a couple of hours, and when I woke up again, I was ready to tackle the day.

I did my usual routine, including going to the gym. But let me tell you, I'm feeling way more tired than usual since I started taking the full 20mg dose yesterday. So, I'm taking it slow and easy these days. I'm basically a sloth right now, but hey, at least I'm consistent, right?

On a more serious note, my husband and family have been noticing some positive changes in me, and that's all the motivation I need to keep going! They're seeing a happier, more relaxed me, and that's amazing.

Of course, I still have my moments of anxiety and depression, but I'm learning to manage them better. And honestly, it's nice to know that I'm not alone in this journey. My loved ones are supporting me every step of the way, and that means the world to me.

So, that's my update for today, guys! Thanks for tuning in, and I'll catch you all in the next one!


*WEEK 5-  FINALLY DAY 7*

Hey guys, welcome back to my daily log! Today marks 5 weeks and 7 days on Prozac, and I'm feeling pretty accomplished. I mean, I've made it this far without totally losing my mind, so that's a win, right?

Tomorrow's the big 6-week mark, and I'm low-key excited to see what the next week brings. Will I finally start feeling like a functional human being? Only time will tell.

So, about those side effects... insomnia's been kicking my butt lately, and I'm feeling a little meh about life. But hey, at least I'm consistent, right? I've also been experiencing some numbness in my head, but I'm pretty sure that's just my brain's way of telling me to chill out.

Despite all the ups and downs, today was actually a pretty good day! I hit the gym at 5:30pm took Prozac at 4:52pm, which always gives me a much-needed energy boost. And let's be real, it's always a good day when I get to wear my comfiest workout clothes.

I'm still getting used to this whole medication thing, but I'm determined to make it work. I mean, I've come this far, and I'm not about to give up now. Plus, I've heard it can take a few months to really start feeling the benefits, so I'm trying to be patient.

1hs9nnc,https://youtu.be/aeccuja_pBY?si=3X9tRXRo2KFn_c_0,The ultimate guide to puppy biting,"

Puppies do not bite out of aggression or being malicious, they do this as a form of communication and as a way of exploring the environment. 

Puppy Biting is really frustrating and upsetting for owners, especially when you haven't had a puppy before or in such a long time or you have children. 

Lots of people think that because puppies draw blood and growl the puppy is aggressive. 

This is a common misconception, puppies have razor sharp teeth and they hurt us. This is why they draw blood because their teeth are literally like needles, this is another reason their mum is so keen on them being weaned as these painful teeth begin to come through and why a lot of mums tell the puppies off when the puppies attempt to latch when they have teeth. 

Basic biology also explains this. When a human punches through glass it is not the punching through the glass that causes bleeding. It is the pulling back. As the human pulls their hand back, the skin is torn pulling against the glass. 

This is the same principle with puppies. The bleeding is because subconsciously humans pull back. 

Kittens also make humans bleed and especially with their claws when treating humans legs like a scratch tree to climb up. Again the kittens teeth and claws are super sharp as these are their baby teeth. 

So the sharpness of the teeth is physiological and moving onto the growling, all dogs and puppies growl and we never punish the growl. 

Dogs don't only growl due to aggression, they growl like cats pur, out of contentment, they growl to initiate play, they growl during play to match arousal levels of another puppy or growl to initiate play or growl because it feels good. 

We have to remember we typically have a puppy at 8 weeks old. All of these behaviours of biting typically are the worst and relentless between 8 weeks and 6 months. 

Just think for a moment compared to a human baby how much pressure and expectations we place on a puppy! 

We expect a lot of their mothers, that their mothers have taught them about biting, bite inhibition, toileting, and to behave straight away ready for the new owners. 

Nope, the mothers teach a little bite inhibition, mothers are tending to take breaks for their own sanity and physical well being by the time the puppies are all wrestling and play fighting with one another. 

The mother also doesn't teach toileting behaviours that humans want, they do stimulate the puppies bladder and bowels so that they do wee and poo. But mothers can also inadvertently teach puppies to eat their poop as many mothers eat poop to keep the area clean. 

Puppies initially learn through observation which is why many puppies do this behaviour in their new homes and owners are traumatised by this. 

So their mothers are not magicians in teaching them how to behave for the new owners. 

They raise them and keep them warm and fed and stimulate the toileting needs. They also teach them about some behaviours and the environment. So the mothers contribute to the initial socialisation process. Not playing socialisation but exposure to the environment. 

Let's also remember, not all bitches are born mothers, some puppies are unlucky enough to loose their mother during delivery, some puppies are a single or a very small litter. So less learning will occur. 

So once we understand this we then turn the brunt to the Breeders, well they should of toilet trained and stopped them from biting and have trained them to be ready for their new homes. 

Nope. Breeders who are good are the ones socialising the puppies to people, children, different noises, different surfaces and a program called puppy culture. 

Puppy culture is too long to write about here but is a whole programme to ensure that the puppies bred are to the highest standards for health both physical and mental. 

So let's start looking at a programme 

Let's begin with… 

What not to do with a puppy biting

Do not use any physical force or any kind of physical punishment. Even if your parents or grandparents used to smack the pup on the bum or the nose. No. A million times, no. 

Do not squeal or scream. Another of the hardest Myths to debunk, do not squeal or scream or yell. Because your making your puppy deliriously excited. Your now joining in and matching how much fun they are having. 

Humans are not dogs and cannot imitate puppy mates or their mother. Physiologically impossible. The Hormone of excitement and stress is shared by the same hormone in both human and dogs. So the puppy cannot tell your stressed and instead tread this as excitement. We use high pitched voices with dogs and puppies to meet their audible level which creates excitement and interest in Training so when you squeal etc during biting this is what your doing. They cannot differentiate. 

Do not use the crate as punishment The crate is a safe place. If your going to go down the route of Super Nanny we don't use naughty steps we do something called redirection which I will explain in the do's section. 

Do not squeeze their jaw shut this is not only cruel and unnecessary but you could also cause major damage to their delicate bones and muscles. 

Do not ram your fingers into their mouth. Again this is cruel and unnecessary and most likely they will bite out of fear. This is a whole other battle which you really do not want. 
Do not spray them with water. This is cruel and unnecessary and puppies do not need a negative association of water. The puppy or dog that won't walk in the rain… the puppy or dog who's terrified of water and won't swim… 

Do not alpha roll them. It doesn't matter what you've seen on TV pinning a puppy or a dog is cruel and again humans have no place doing this. We cannot imitate a dogs behaviour. 
Do not pin them to the floor. This is cruel and terrifying. 
I think the do not's can end here as I think this forms a full picture of what not to do. 

What to do with a puppy biting… 
Be quiet. There's no need to scream etc as above. Whenever I'm bit by a puppy or even an aggressive dog. I'm quiet. Being quiet is the best thing to do so that the puppy does not think that I am getting excited. The last thing I want to do is increase their arousal level. 

Time outs. OK so as I said the crate is never to be used for punishment the crate is their safe space. So what you can do instead is get them a toy such as a Frozen Kong, frozen chicken wing or duck wing or suitable raw frozen item according to the manufacturer's guidelines, such as Natures Menu in the UK. If you want them away from you for a break fine, have a baby gate in the doorway and give them a calm session in the hallway or kitchen, whichever room you can utilise. This isn't to punish them but to give them an opportunity to expel the energy and chew or play a brain game and then sleep. 

Begin to learn that your house is now shared with a furry land shark who you need to bargain with. Joking aside what I mean by this is begin to learn to have pots of treats around the home. So you don't have a puppy hanging off your trousers whilst trying to get to the kitchen to scatter feed for example. Pots of treats around the home are a life saver. If you have pockets all the time learn to join the crumb crew and carry treats in your pocket. Have toys like a pocket tug to hand, either on a shelf or in your pocket and as soon as your puppy has that glint in their eyes choose your defence weapon. Is it a toy or is treats or is it both. 

Put the phone down. I know its hard, but you have a puppy. You chose a puppy. Your time is no longer your own. Much like a baby the puppy wants attention it's better to engage when they approach then pushing them away or ignoring them. Again pushing them away. You've just made a fun game of ""Push me and I come back harder and even more aroused, whoo hoo."" In my home my dogs have formed their own unwritten rule with me. If I take a while to respond to a message or a comment you can bet it is because I've had the phone pushed out of my hand and I have to engage with my Dogs. And sometimes they even take turns doing this. I submit immediately because I know they need me, be it a cuddle or a scratch or they want to play. Once I satisfy this need, they are happy and go to sleep or play with a toy by themselves. They do this unique behaviour because I have reinforced it. When they were puppies they would come and jump up or bite and they learnt that the phone got put down and they got the attention they needed. Hence I've reinforced it. And I wouldn't have it any other way. 

Despite what you've been told your puppy is not trying to dominate you (it's a myth) and there's zero harm of having them on the sofa or the bed! Yep that's right. If you want a snuggle on the sofa or bed with your puppy do it. There's nothing wrong with it. If you have children this becomes a case of management. So you are going to have to train a cue of when the puppy is and isn't allowed on the sofa. If they are allowed on with you say ""up"", ""sofa"", ""OK"", I personally say cuddles. This will help them to differentiate between when they are allowed on and what they are not, but you need to do the hard work. Of managing puppy and children. If you don't want them on the sofa with your children again your going to have to look at a Kong etc for a calm time. 

Now we have covered the do's and don'ts, let's now look at the Toy options you have. Remember I'm in the UK so you may have more or less access to these items or you may find you have the same but a different company for example in the UK we have Tug-E-Nuff in the US you have 4 my Merles creations which is the same and based in Canada. 

Tug Toys 

OK so let's discuss Tug-E-Nuff to begin with. Absolutely amazing products. Rabbit fur or sheep skin or artificial fur, handmade and custom made when you place your order. A range of pocket tugs, tugs on a long line for space and distance, squeaky tugs, bungee tugs. These toys are literally crack for Dogs. Tug-E-Nuff include a pamphlet in their package which also tells you what I am about to say. These are a high value toy which is only to be played with when you interact with the puppy or dog. They will be annihilated if you leave them with the dog or puppy. If you don't know how to play Tug instead of leaving a complicated link of letters and symbols you'll be frustrated with writing down when this document becomes a Pdf go to YouTube and type in Miyagis Dog Training Two Tug Toy game. I have made instructional videos on how to play Tug with your Dog. 
Tug does not make your puppy or dog aggressive it does teach them bite inhibition, it does meet the needs of natural instincts and natural expression.

Sleep

One of the most least known things about puppies is sleep and how much sleep they require. 18 hours per day! Sleeping through the night is great however all those nap times in the day add up and quantifies to 18 hours. Puppies not allowed to sleep or constantly disrupted, mouth and bite just like an over tired toddler, screaming, shouting, smashing the house up etc. We need to ensure they get plenty of sleep for physical and mental health needs. And biting is a side effect of being overtired. 

Walks

People think walks will tire a puppy or resolve the situation, nope. Walks can heighten arousal levels. If you don't let your puppy off to run they will also not be burning the energy that they need to burn, so the next thing you experience with horror and probably fear is the Zoomies. Which I will discuss in a moment. For puppies we want to work with them, when they are on, they are on and this is the time to engage with them. When they are off, they are off and we need to ensure they are settled and feel safe and undisturbed to fulfill the need to sleep and the benefits that sleep brings them. 

Walks are also not a frog march and the puppy should be allowed to sniff and interact with the environment. Although this is about puppy biting when we say socialise we do not mean them meeting every dog and puppy they see and playing. We mean socialising to the environment and getting used to sounds of wind, people, traffic, seeing dogs at a distance, different noises and smells. A puppy allowed to play with every dog they meet, will not only have social interaction problems as an adult or earlier but will also be on a massive high when you come home. So that poo and wee they did, that's because they was too excited to go to the toilet out and because excitement stimulates the bowels and bladder. And also the Zoomies when you get in too. 

Zoomies 

Zoomies is an excess or residue of energy which has to come out, again no different to kids charging around screaming at the top of their lungs. To people who don't know dogs or puppies for example a first time dog owner this can look terrifying, they charge around, punching on furniture barking and growling or squealing wild eyes and they are having the time of their life. So that's all Zoomies are just a lot of pent up energy being released before crashing. 

Mental stimulation 

Mental stimulation in the form of engaging with your puppy, play, Brain Games, toys are really important for the development of your puppy and meeting their needs and this continues all through adulthood. All dogs ancestors at one point were bred for a job, be it ratting, herding, carting, hunting, livestock guardians or like the doodle for Assistance dog work. 

We have a duty of care to meet the needs of the dog regardless or breed and genetics but we also have to understand that the Dog or puppy will be influenced to a degree based on their breed and genetics. So if you have a nippy Collie, they are practicing instincts of herding, if you have a retrieving breed they are practicing the instinct of retrieving. At some point the stereotypes of the breeds behaviour was selectively bred into your pups line at one time and we have to respect how much we relied on dogs through the ages to assist us. 

The puppy blues are real, the frustration, the pain you feel are all valid and real. Us Dog Trainers and Behaviourists we get it. We understand but we also know the right way in how to support the puppy and dog for success and for a happy lifestyle and life with you as the owner. This is why this guide has been written to offer you as much generalised advice as possible. Remember this is not individual advice or specific to your individual puppy. You may need to invest in a Trainer or Behaviourist for further Training and help. 

Remember your puppy is not being aggressive, trying to dominate you, eat you or ruin your life. They are a different species with different needs and as soon as you begin bonding and working with them. You will have a mega awesome relationship! 

One last note: as well as the toy recommendations above more toys to look into are 

Boomer Balls for destructive puppies and dogs

Kong range - The Canine Emporium on Facebook are a UK stockist of a large selection of Kong toys not available in pet shops. 

Goughnuts - a little pricey but as they are chewed they have a colour in the middle to tell you when it is time to replace the item.

Tree Root, Coffee Wood or Wood chews non splintering - available from most pet shops or Amazon and eBay as well as most online dog outlet stores.
