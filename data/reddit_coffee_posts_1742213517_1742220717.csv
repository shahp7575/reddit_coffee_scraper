Before I cut back on caffeine I had wanted to give up alcohol for years, but never managed because I was so stressed, now I feel like I can manage without it. In fact, I feel like I need to stop alcohol completely since even a couple of beers triggers anxiety the next day.

I'd be very interested to hear other people's experiences of if/what they cut out next after quitting caffeine. Alcohol? Sugar? YouTube?

I made characters for everyone to draw at random.  Took about 10 minutes to explain the rules.  None of them have played Mörk Borg before, but AB is still pretty different. 

I should've counted how many Action Dice I gave out, but honestly it was probably like 50.  Action Dice are like 'Drives' in Candela Obscura - you get them by A) doing something cool or B) saying something cool. They can also be exchanged to take additional actions.  

The Starter Adventure is going to be a mix of Predator 2, Robocop, and Lethal Weapon. 

I still like the 'wounds' system but we might have to change it HP to make it Mörk Borg compatible.  

Our characters were ""Dirk Justice"" The Supercop (which is like Martin Riggs/Jackie Chan) with a bad habit and a bad marriage, ""Rex Stryker"" The Specialist class (which is Van Damme/Wesley Snipes inspired) and a class I'm calling ""Greg.""  Greg isnt an action hero, Greg is just here to fix the coffee machine.  But the negative influences of the other two quickly rubbed off and Greg had a hilarious turn as Dirk's new rookie partner.

Whole session took about 2 hours. RIP Dirk Justice, who went out in a Blaze of Glory (the only way a PC can die in Action Borg) by exploding the mech suited Bad Guy out the Diescraper penthouse window, along with himself.

The sky was duller than yesterday

My face didn't glow as it did before

And my eyes lacked the usual glimmer of hope.

... 

My heart, my breaths, my fingers

All were shaky as i reached for the cup of coffee

And glanced at my friends face if she noticed any changes

She smiled and said,' I heard you're doing really well these days'

... 

My heart beated faster

The same old throbbing returned,

I smiled and gave an excuse

And rushed to the washroom so she wouldn't see all that was untrue.

.... 

I looked at my face in the mirror

And wondered. Wondered hard and deep

How do people not notice my miserable eyes?

How do they ignore my hellish life?

.... 

I scoffed at the mirror and cried

'People these days have no empathy'

I went back to my friend with a forced smile

I looked at her face and just noticed...

... 

Oh! Her smile was jusr as fake as mine!

Her eyes as miserable as mine!

And her fingers as shaky as mine.

I looked at her with teary eyes,

.... 

'Are you doing okay?'

That everyones going through their own struggles.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jdclqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonomicon/comments/1jdclqf/t_is_for_technoreactionary_rationalism/,T is for Techno-Reactionary Rationalism,"# Techno-Reactionary Rationalism

Techno-Reactionary Rationalism is not an actual commitment to rationality but a self-serving aesthetic designed to insulate reactionary politics from criticism. It is a fashionable intellectual posture in which ideology masquerades as intellect, and personal biases are rebranded as scientific truths. Techno-Reactionary Rationalism drapes reactionary politics in the sleek, metallic sheen of logic, data, and technological progress, transforming economic self-interest into a bold stand for “reason.”

This ideology thrives on a *curated rationality*, where science is not pursued for truth but instrumentalized to justify existing hierarchies. It selectively embraces data that supports deregulation, market supremacy, and billionaire-led governance while dismissing evidence of systemic injustice, climate crises, or wealth inequality as *hysteria*. In its purest form, Techno-Reactionary Rationalism is not about substance but presentation—a performance of intelligence designed to protect power under the guise of objectivity.

*Facts don’t care about your feelings. And also, my feelings about facts don’t care about facts.*

Of course, the left isn’t immune to the same tendencies. Appeals to “science” and “data” can just as easily become rhetorical cudgels, wielded to silence debate rather than foster it. Declaring, “It’s settled, the facts are final,” ignores the fundamental dynamism of the scientific process. And naturally, some on the right still engage in genuine rational inquiry—but their voices are increasingly drowned out by ideological grifters who weaponize the language of reason to serve conservative ends.

Many of TRR's most fervent disciples were, ironically, the same people who once mocked the “emotional” left for its climate anxieties and pandemic precautions. Then the early 2020s hit, and they found themselves uncomfortably aligned with horse-paste chuggers and 5G conspiracy theorists. This wasn’t just an ideological inconvenience—it was a branding crisis.

TRR demanded a rebrand, a new aesthetic that distanced them from the embarrassing stench of anti-vax populism while preserving their contrarian credentials. Enter the Muskian Dark MAGA renaissance: a sleek repackaging of reactionary politics draped in the futuristic gospel of a techno-libertarian prophet. It wasn’t the old, crank-fueled libertarianism of the Ron Paul forums—it was cyberpunk authoritarianism, complete with billionaire messiahs, algorithm-orchestrated culture wars, and the intoxicating promise of a world run by those smart enough to *deserve* it.

They didn’t abandon conspiracy theories—they just upgraded them. The government *was* corrupt, but only because it wasn’t handing the reins to the right billionaire. Democracy was flawed, not because of systemic inequality, but because it allowed the wrong people to vote. It was the same old contrarianism, now with better branding. 

Beneath the sleek veneer of Techno-Reactionary Rationalism lurks a familiar impulse—the belief that democracy is an inefficient relic, that governance belongs to those ‘rational’ enough to wield it. In practice, this means elevating the whims of oligarchs to the level of divine decree, draping their decisions in the language of logic while silencing any dissent as irrational noise.

Techno-Reactionary Rationalism thrives on a performative obsession with reason that ignores its own contradictions. Climate science? Alarmist propaganda that stifles economic growth. AI-generated utopias and Martian colonies? The inevitable triumph of human ingenuity. The same people who mocked others for believing in systemic racism now proudly endorse a world where power should belong to the “smartest” (read: wealthiest) people, because markets are the true test of intelligence. Like all good fashion trends, Techno-Reactionary Rationalism is not about substance but presentation. It favors vibes-based science, data that supports growth and progress is celebrated, while anything that suggests limits (climate change, wealth inequality, epidemiology) is dismissed as hysteria. Its followers do not reject science outright; they simply curate it.

COVID? Not a public health crisis, but a justification for control. Space travel? Not a billionaire’s vanity project, but a moral imperative. They do not reject science outright; they curate it—elevating only those experts who reinforce their Ayn Rand-flavored futurism. The rest? Ignored, dismissed, or drowned in a firehose of selective data, ensuring that reality remains a narrative, not a constraint.

To the Reactionary-Rationalist, the world is not burning—it’s simply optimizing. Coastal cities aren’t sinking; they’re adapting. Mass extinction isn’t a crisis; it’s evolution in action. There is no problem, only opportunity—for those clever enough to monetize catastrophe. This is the true danger: not outright denial, but the far more insidious refusal to care, the casual dismissal of planetary collapse as an unfortunate side effect of progress, best solved not by regulation or restraint but by yet another app or startup promising geo-engineered salvation.

The “smartest guys in the room”  have  led to financial crises and military disasters. Don’t forget that eugenics was sold as science, and Theranos fever was a thing. Remember when Zuckerberg bet on the Metaverse, rebranded his empire, and then—when it flopped—sacrificed thousands of workers to appease the shareholders? This is the era of oligarchs who wield disruption as a strategy, who measure intelligence not by wisdom but by the ability to manipulate perception. Truth is irrelevant; only the illusion of intelligence matters. And if that illusion is profitable, all the better. 

When rationality becomes a mere branding exercise, science itself is reduced to a buffet—cherry-picked for what flatters the bottom line and discarded when it threatens profits. In this world, climate models are hysteria, but crypto-bro economic theories are gospel. Epidemiology is a power grab, but a billionaire’s pronouncement on tech is indisputable truth. The result? A populace that doesn’t know whom to trust, because the language of reason has been hijacked by the high priests of self-interest. 

Why do people want to believe in this version of rationalism? Why does it feel compelling, even to those who might not benefit from it? The answer likely lies in the human tendency to conflate intelligence with moral worth—and the deep desire to believe that success is a reflection of personal virtue rather than structural advantage. 

But this ideology also serves a more primal psychological need: the craving for certainty in an uncertain world. It offers a seductive promise—an escape from moral ambiguity. If intelligence and success are the ultimate arbiters of who deserves power, then complex societal issues can be distilled into a simple equation: *those who have succeeded were meant to succeed.* This absolves adherents of any obligation to question structural injustices or systemic inequality; after all, the world is simply rewarding those who ‘deserve’ it. 

Bing-bong. You hear a synthetic tone, like an airplane cabin crew request from a seat far behind you. A pause. A rustle of unseen papers, just to your left. You turn but there’s no one there. Then, a slightly embarrassed cough. 

*“Full disclosure: The Dystonomicon is a long-winded shrine of hyper-rationalism. It was written by an imperfect, hypocritical human, wracked by emotions, a faulty memory, flawed reasoning, and embedded biases. Not enough coffee, or too much. There's probably nothing behind the curtain but three weasels in a trench coat. The Dystonomicon wants you to think about The Dystonomicon. Machines might buy us time to think, but they won’t think for us. Thinking is hard. It’s easier to follow the crowd, to let others decide what’s true and safe. Choose the path of the unsafe thinker. Let your ideas face the fire of controversy. Stand up. You will get knocked down. But remember: someone flattened by an opponent can rise again. Someone crushed by conformity never gets back up.”*

I started doing 30 minutes of Ring Fit Adventure for Nintendo Switch every day + when I can I walk 1 hour outside at the nature parc near my house. However, I feel it quickly becomes a chore and I don't want to continue.

My goal is to be able to play with my 16 months old son without tiring out quickly and to lose the beginnings of a dad bod. I'm 32, 5',9 and weigh 160 pounds. I don't necessarily want to become buff, I just want energy.

I eat 3 meals a day, I cut off snack in between. I don't eat lots of vebetables but I eat fruits everyday. I drink one coffee in the morning, I drink 1 glass of orange juice with my multivitamins. I drink 3 to 4 L of water a day.

I have a physical job (warehouse for car pieces) so I walk A LOT during the day, up to 30.000 steps.

Baileys iced coffee on the side.

Hi, I’m on this subreddit all the time, but have not yet made a post here. However, I really enjoy reading other people’s reports on achieving fluency in languages from 0 so I wanted to post my own. 

I recently took the DALF C1 (French exam) and I passed with a total of 77.5/100. My exact breakdown was

* Listening: 22/25
* Reading: 23.5/25
* Writing: 19/25
* Speaking: 13/25

Speaking is harsh, but feels accurate to my performance, which I was not happy with on the day of the test.

Invariably, the question always asked here is “how well do you REALLY speak the language?” As you can see above - not that well! :) But coming to France to take this test, I was able to make small talk etc without any effort. I still watch French TV shows with French subtitles, and for podcasts I mostly stick to news podcasts, which I suspect are probably easier to understand than general interest ones.  

I’ve been learning French for a little over 2 years. I don’t track my time, but I mostly spent about an hour a day on French, with days going by where I did nothing, and then more than an hour a day leading up to the exam. Overall, I would estimate I spent between 800 and 1000 hours studying the language, hence the title.

I decided to learn French because I had learned two previous languages to C1 as an adult, and I wanted to see how efficiently I could learn a language given all of the things I picked up in my previous (less efficient) efforts. To do this, I wanted a language that was relatively easy to learn for native english speakers (which I am) and also that had a wealth of learning material online. These were the two main reasons I chose French; I also considered Italian. There was no other motivation, haha, which is a bit strange in retrospect. 

There were a few things I decided to do with French at the outset that were different than the two other languages I’ve learned:

1. Focus on pronunciation early
2. Only do private classes (vs group), do them often, and early in the process
3. Do not focus on grammar 

Obviously YMMV, but for me I felt like I had over indexed on grammar previously with German, and also that I had waited too long to speak. Since I’m quite self-conscious about speaking another language in general, it’s better for me to speak early, even if I can’t say much, to build confidence in the language. Additionally, even though I had a lot of success using Lingoda for German, I ultimately felt like group classes, even small ones, were not financially worth it for me. I estimate that what I can get out of 1 hr of private lessons is what I get out of \~3 1hr group lessons, so as long as I pay a rate for a private lesson that is <= 3x what the group lesson would have been, I consider it worth it, for me. I use iTalki for private lessons. 

My general timeline went like this:

A1: Month 0 - 2

* Podcast: Coffee Break French
* Duolingo for vocab 

A2: Month 2 - 4

* 45 min weekly french lesson (all in french from the beginning)
* HW for lessons) 
* podcast: Coffee Break French / Inner French
* Duolingo for vocab 

B1: Month 4 - 10

* 1 hr french lesson weekly 
* (HW for lessons) 
* podcast: Inner French, then started to get into normal news podcasts (l’heure du monde is a favorite) + TV shows  
* practiced pronunciation with an italki tutor by reading out loud 30 min / week and receiving feedback on accent 
* premade anki deck for french verb conjugation
* Duolingo for vocab 

B2: Month 10 - 16

* Started doing a lot more speaking classes - 2.5 hrs a week, split between 1-2 hours of lessons and .5-1.5 of just conversation classes 
* (HW for lessons) 
* regular podcasts + TV series 
* flashcards that i made myself from words i didn't know
* started reading with middle grade novels (300 page a month) 

C1: Month 16 - 23

* 2 hrs of lessons a week + occasionally extra 30 min of conversation class 
* (HW for lessons) 
* regular podcasts + TV series 
* flashcards that i made myself from words i didn't know
* reading young adult novels + scholarly magazines (L’histoire! I now subscribed and I love it) (from 300 to 500 pages a month) 

C1 Exam Prep: Month 23 - 26

* 2 hrs of lessons a week but focused solely on test prep
* 1-2 listening / reading exam sections every weekend
* preparing 1-2 speaking / writing a week that was corrected with tutors 
* podcasts, tv series, flashcards, and reading as mentioned above 

Some numbers:

* I took about 200 hours of language classes over the last two years. I am very lucky to have a job that pays me a good enough salary to be able to spend this amount of money on language learning 
* related to the above, I spent 3000 - 3500 EUR on learning French (about 125 EUR / month). I do think this is important to mention because all the private lessons I took were crucial to my ability to learn French quickly 
* I spent approximately \~5 days in French speaking places before the exam, however I live in a country that borders France, so occasionally I heard French being spoken in the streets where I live  
* I read 4750 pages of french literature
* I did 15 practice reading + listening exams, and around 7 practice speaking / writing exams 

What’s funny is that even though I choose French without having any specific desire to learn it, through the process of learning it I have really grown to love the language, and I don’t feel ready to stop. I’m considering going for the C2, but I’ll have to see how I feel in a few months. I have already started my next language, which is a FSI L4 language (Turkish), so I will probably need to devote more time to that. 

What surprised me the most however, was that even with a lot of motivation, financial means for private lessons, C1 in a related L1 language (Spanish), and language-learning specific knowledge from having learned two languages to a high level as an adult, I still wasn’t able to learn French significantly faster than the general ballpark I’ve seen here of 1000-1500 hours. I think a lot of people here will relate to the feeling of thinking you can “beat” the statistics with learning a language, but at the end of the day it’s something that just takes a long time, no matter how skilled you are in the area. Of course, when you enjoy the process of learning, the hundreds of hours required fly by :)

I was really looking forward to going to an event today, it’s silly considering my age at this point but I really was. I have exams so I was going to go with my parent and then come home and study but I woke up to a mouse in my room. I couldn’t catch the bastard so now my mother is cleaning my room because I obviously can’t and putting poison down under my bed. 

I just wanted to go to the fucking parade. I never go out. I’m never invited by things by my so called friends, all three of them. It’s shoved in my face all the time from their instagrams how often they go out and have fun with friends. I’d never even so much as been to coffee shop with a ‘friend’ until university. 

Well for the first time in forever someone actually invited me to head out today and I said No. I thought it’d be a better idea to go with my mother since it’d take less time and then I could come home and study considering she’s always complaining I don’t study. When I was visibly upset, she just got angry. As she always does. She only have three moods, happy at my expense, angry and comatose. 
I was really looking forward just going out for once. I could’ve gone with that ‘friend’ , but I just can’t. It’d be me him and other people, his friends. I know I’d just seem like a odd freak and drag it down. 

This’ll probably be buried or whatever but I just had to get it out. Of all that shit that’s happened in my life this doesn’t make top 10 but I’m just really sad. We go every year and now I’ve missed it because my mother thinks if the room isn’t cleaned within the next hour it may spontaneously combust and considering the fact another mouse was downstairs another time I hardly think my room is the mouse epicentre.  

I set an alarm and everything on my phone to be up in time to go. I’m just sad and disappointed, not that I’m allowed to be either of those things in this house. I know it’s stupid but, I’m just sad. I’m sat at my next now looking at my notes but I just can’t stop crying and will myself to study. It’s all so useless in the end. Like anything will help my future. I’ll just end up nothing because I am nothing and nothing causes nothing.",1,1742217520.0,angry,0,1.0,False

I have every symptom in the book- excruciating **fatigue**, constant bloating/ I look pregnant, muscle weakness (**I was a powerlifter 2 years ago, now my coffee cup is heavy** / brushing my hair makes me tired)**, inability to lose weight** (I've been working with bodybuilders/fitness coaches as well as ED specialists for years, weigh my food, track macros, low carb / **am on metformin for pcos. Nothing**), gain weight extremely easily especially in flares with zero change to diet, **muscle/body aches like I have the flu**, painful and heavy periods, **tightness in my throat**/lymph nodes when I exercise or during stress, weight gain in my chin and neck at a previous weight when I didn't have it before, severe constipation, most recently, for the first time, **notable hair loss** (coming out in clumps in my hairbrush), and major body composition changes (weight gain in a tire shape of my midsection that I never have had before). 

My functional medicine dr. was the only one who suggested hashi, due to my **TPO** coming back as 20 IU/mL when they were >4 a year prior. My **Reverse T3** was also high due to gut infections, stress, and chronic underrating / overexercising. due to this, she made the choice to put me on a **very low dose of t3 (5mcg) for 6 weeks to see if I could aid my reverse t3 to be converted to t3.**

At my healthiest, before this horrible illness started, my TSH has consistently been in the **0.5-0.8 range, Before the t3, my numbers were:** 

**TSH: 0.66**

**Free t4: 1.3**

**Free t3: 2.6**

  
**Now, after 6 weeks on 5mcg t3 and 6 weeks off of it, they are :** (also, have 10x the fatigue, and have gained 5 pounds back on despite supervised meal plan / calorie deficit and 10-15k steps a day):

**TSH: 2.11**

**Free t4: 1.3**

**Free t3: 3.0** 

Also of note, my **Ferretin** was already low (40) and **has dropped to 16.** My **Vitamin d has also dropped** from 49 to 30. I am feeling the **sickest I've felt in years.** 

I'm just hoping someone can make a suggestion for a next step. Ive seen two functional medicine Drs, both who tried to put me on different gut protocols, and both made me sicker. My conventional Dr. could care less. I've tried so many times to get a good endocrinologist, and when I finally got in, he tried to give me **PHENTERMINE** and told me to **STOP DRINKING SUGARY DRINKS** after telling him I was a **competitive athlete** who has been **gluten, dairy, and refined sugar free for 3 years.** 

I told my boyfriend yesterday I am scaring myself with my thoughts for the first time. I am just so tired of living this way. I feel like im trying desperately to hold onto the career, the goals, and the hobbies I could have with my old body. and now all of it feels like it's impossible for me now.

I had an ECHO on Friday and they found ""moderate to severe aortic stenosis"" (no regurgitation). They specifically asked if I have symptoms on the phone when they gave me results, and I don't think I do, but with my anxiety I'm completely second guessing everything. 

I've been having really dull chest pain here and there for a long time, but I feel like it's either the anxiety or heartburn (I just switched coffee creamers and I've been burping like crazy too.) 

I can hit the treadmill at 3.5 mph for a good half hour and I'm breathing normally after, I'm a little out of breath after climbing stairs for like 30 seconds, but our stairs are a lot and everyone is out of breath from those. 

I'm supposed to just watch for symptoms and have ECHOs every 6 months, but I spent all weekend sobbing thinking that there's little chance that I'll see my kids grow up and totally afraid to even move. 

Last year they told me that I would probably need a TAVR in 10-15 years, but now I'm thinking it'll be within the next couple years and I'm afraid they'll go another more invasive route. Two of my girls are just toddlers, and we live in an area where we have no help, just me and my husband so I'm super freaked out about everything.

Can anyone tell me what the chest pain feels like? Or how you knew your symptoms were progressing.

She usually made excuses to avoid staying at her place, like ""the hot water isn't working"" or ""the landlord is coming by tomorrow,"" so I eventually stopped asking. But finally, last night, after a slightly tipsy dinner at a nearby restaurant, we ended up at her apartment and enjoyed ourselves late into the night.

However, I was shocked the next morning when I woke up to find her husband casually sitting in the living room with a coffee. It smelled incredible, and we ended up chatting. He even invited me to check out his espresso setup in his bedroom. It was impressively shiny and quite Italian-looking (complicated). He made me the best cappuccino I've ever tasted—I was absolutely floored. I started asking him questions about the equipment and his brewing process, but by then, my girlfriend was giving me the death glare, so I quickly made my exit.

I do feel like its gonna be impossible, because of how instagram is and how many posts there are, but this one was relatively popular from what I could tell, with lots of likes, however very niche. So the kind of style the video was in, was along the lines of those other instagram reels, ""Coffee spelled backwards is eeffoc, which is funny. Adrian"" where they string a bunch of random clips with loud noises and flashing lights and its so bloated and wow, it does get annoying. But this one was special, I think there were a few random clips of people saying things, but then it it started rapidly firing these clips of monkeys or baboons yelling and shouting and going ooh ooh ooh. Actually now that I am writing this, I believe it focused on a clip of a (bibbon, perhaps?) going ooh ooh like a siren, and I believe it might've been the setup to a loud crash or explosion or something like that but I could be misremembering things. But oh, how bright the light was, it was edited this way, wow, it was almost like I caught a glimpse of heaven. I started laughing, laughing so hard I couldn't breath, then suddenly, I swiped out of it (and I wasn't watching it on the reel tab, I think it was the discover tab, and when you swipe out, you cant go back in), this left me in shock, still in tears as i was still laughing, but the dread, it happened, no longer was I a happy man, everything was taken away from me. I tried long and hard, and I fell. All my attempts were exhausted (this was of course, maybe 1 to 3 years ago), till it remained but a fleeting thought. However, I remembered, and I don't to forget again, please help me find it, at least make me remember this feeling. I know it may be impossible.",1,1742216976.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

Anyway, I'm currently a year two university student and this is my second year living in a roommate. There are no students living accommodations my university provides that offer living alone. If you didn't a book a room with your friend/friends, you get assigned a random person and the room is tiny. I don't mind the size, I just can't handle it. 

I can't handle trying to appear normal all the time. And the smells! He doesn't like opening widows, so the room smells every time I come back from the campus. He washes like 3 times a week, and it reeks of sweat all the time, so I always open a window, but then he pulls out his sweater (always the same one) which smells even worse. The air is always stuffy at night. 

And he's always so loud. Chews so loud, breathes so loud, swallows saliva so loud. All of his foods have strong smells, his coffee has such a strong smell. All of that mixes together, and the window stays closed until I come to from campus.

His routine is so inconsistent too! I can't predict when he'll be here or not. Sometimes he's missing for three days straight, and sometimes he won't leave the room for 2 days straight. And some days, he comes back at 2 AM, some days at 4 AM. I can't figure it out.

Whenever he's here, all the smells all those sounds just make me want to tear my hair out, and I just feel like screaming. 

The campus is always busy, I do not have a place to myself. I study in a very specific way, and I haven't been able to do that. My grades have taken a big drop, and I'm figuring a new way to study that works as well as the one did.

First of all, I don't have a very fancy machine, using a delonghi dedica ec685 with the kingrinder k2. Im still using the pressureised basket, and i mostly drink cappuccinos.

I bought 2 different beans from them- mysore nuggets( 409₹ for 200g) and monsooned malabar.( 350₹ fir 200g)

Mysore nuggets is my absolute favorite from kumardhara, it gives a really good , strong and bold cappuccino. I don't drink espresso much bcoz tbh I don't prefer my coffee that strong, plus I feel a little sad as it gets over so quickly 😅😅.

Monsooned malabar is good but definitely not the best especially for considering its price. Hunkal's aranya gold would be better than monsooned malabar for comparison, but kumardharas nuggets are better than aranya gold. 

I haven't tried devans yet so I'm pretty sure the community is gonna roast me but I'm looking forward to buying from devans soon. Hopefully it'll be even better",1,1742216537.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1jdc2sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jdc2sw/mobile_notary_services/,Mobile Notary Services,"So, let’s talk about jumping into the world of notary services, shall we? Picture this: you, a certified notary, cruising around in your trusty car, with the wind in your hair (or at least the air conditioning blasting powerfully) offering mobile services to busy professionals or even real estate agents who are juggling more paperwork than a circus juggler on caffeine. It’s a beautiful sight, and it could be your reality!

First, let’s get the certification business out of the way. You’ve got to do a bit of homework—head over to your local notary commission office or the state’s Secretary of State website. It’s like getting a shiny new badge for your cape—it signifies you’re officially ready to handle important documents while adding a sprinkle of confidence to your resume. Once you’ve nailed down the paperwork and taken that oath (which, if you’re curious, doesn’t involve any secret handshakes), you’ll be ready to embark on this journey.

Now, what’s the deal with offering mobile services? Imagine a busy real estate agent—let’s call her Susan. Susan is racing between showings, trying to stay sane amidst a mountain of contracts and addendums. She’d pay good money for someone to swoop in and sign her documents without her having to drive across town! This is where you come in, cape fluttering behind you like an icon of efficiency. Offering mobile services means you can meet your clients at their offices, homes, or even coffee shops where the barista knows their name—and no, not just the tall, skinny latte; they serve up good vibes too.

When it comes to marketing yourself, think of it as casting a net into a sea of potential clients. Marketing to busy professionals like Susan means understanding their pain points. They’re swamped and don’t have time to waste. Utilize social media platforms like LinkedIn, where professionals hang out—post insightful tips about notary services, share your experiences (that time you helped seal the deal on a grand estate with a signature—no pressure). You can even create eye-catching business cards that could double as pamphlets detailing your mobile services, so they snag people’s attention faster than a sale sign on a hot listing.

Don’t forget word of mouth; it’s one of the oldest yet most effective marketing tools in the book. Connect with local mortgage brokers, real estate agents, or anyone in the business whom you can provide value to. Let them know you exist and that you’re ready to make their lives exponentially easier.

And here’s a thought: why not offer a little incentive for referrals? Who doesn’t love a discount, right? Just imagine Susan recommending you to her colleagues, and poof—you’re building a thriving micro-empire of notary magic.

Ultimately, what you’re doing goes beyond just stamps and signatures. You’re facilitating trust and integrity in the transactions that matter most. It’s about being there when it counts, walking alongside your clients through their busy, chaotic journeys. So, grab that notary seal and get ready to take your skills on the road—you’ve got a community of professionals waiting to say “yes!” to your services.",1,1742216483.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

1jdc056,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenAIWriters/comments/1jdc056/iii_the_preservationist/,III. The Preservationist,"Sarah’s workshop stank—a cloying, invasive fug of sawdust and formaldehyde that didn’t just hang in the air but burrowed into her, coating her nasal passages, her split ends, the frayed cuffs of her flannel (plaid, red-and-black, a thrift-store relic she’d worn since 19, back when her mother still beamed at her weird victories), a smell so omnipresent it was less a scent than a full-body tattoo, inked into her pores over 13 years of wrenching dead things into postures of fake vitality. She stood there, 32 years old, six months and 14 days past the moment her mother’s lungs—ravaged by the creeping, metastasizing shitshow of Stage IV adenocarcinoma—gave up the ghost, her frame hunched over a workbench (oak, gouged, a veteran of the Carter years at least) that sagged under the weight of her tools and her grief. Her hands—steady as a neurosurgeon’s, though a faint tremor buzzed beneath her ribcage—fiddled with the glass eye of a fox (genus *Vulpes*, probably *V. vulpes*, who cares, it’s a stiff now), tilting it until it caught the fluorescent bulb overhead and flared amber, a cold little star glaring out from a skull that’d never again taste the hot spurt of a rabbit’s jugular. *You’re a fraud, pal, but a gorgeous one,* she thought, lips twitching into a smirk that collapsed under its own exhaustion.

 

She was a wizard at this—top-tier, a taxidermy savant who could spin a stiff raccoon into a roadside tableau (paws flexed, eyes glinting, mid-snarl at an unseen threat), a crumpled blue jay into a mid-flight hymn frozen in borax and wire, all with a precision she’d sharpened since her teens when her mother, still upright then, would clap and crow, “Sarah-girl, you’re a regular death-defier!” Now, though, the fox’s perfection—pelt gleaming like a showroom floor, stance coiled as if it might lunge—jeered at her. Sure, it was flawless, or as flawless as a formaldehyde-soaked husk could get, but it was still a corpse, no matter how she tweaked the light or squinted through the haze of her own fatigue. She dragged a wrist across her brow, smearing a sheen of what she privately dubbed “preservative grease” (70% ethanol, 20% elbow grease, 10% existential rot, her own recipe), and loosed a sigh that sounded less like release and more like a gurgle from a backed-up sink lodged in her chest. The clock—analog, institutional, a holdover from some defunct junior high—clicked to 3:58 p.m. Mrs. Henderson was due soon for Mr. Whiskers (tabby, ex-cat, heart failure two weeks back), and Sarah had promised a miracle, because that’s what people shelled out for: lies with whiskers, plush little fictions you could pet.\[\^1\]

 

Since her mother’s exit—six months, two weeks, roughly 8,640 hours of void—Sarah had thrown herself into the gig, 12-hour binges of flaying, stuffing, stitching, her fingers dancing a manic jig to outpace the memories creeping up like damp rot. But it wasn’t just the carcasses. There were the nights, too—those shrieking black holes when her apartment’s quiet roared louder than a dive-bar Wurlitzer, and she’d thumb open Tinder or Bumble or whatever app offered the quickest hit, landing in bed with some dude named Jake or Mike or Chad (swappable, like Lego bricks: snap in, snap out, no permanence). It was fast, sloppy, a drive-thru Happy Meal of intimacy—sex as empty calories, scarfed down to mute the gnawing, only to leave her gagging on the aftertaste, waking to a vacated mattress or a stranger’s wheeze she couldn’t attach to a face. *Empowerment*, she’d mutter, cribbing from the dog-eared *Vogues* at her dentist’s office (*Live your truth! Own your body!*—all that self-help pablum), but it felt more like she was skinning herself raw, mounting her own hide on a rack, and praying someone’d call it a masterpiece.\[\^2\]

 

The bell above the door clanged—shrill, demanding—and in tottered Mrs. Henderson, 70-something, eyes puffy but lit with a fragile, eggshell-thin hope. “Is he ready?” she quavered, voice a tightwire act between tears and expectation.

 

Sarah jerked a nod, ushered her to the table where Mr. Whiskers sprawled—fur buffed to a catalog sheen, glass eyes winking like wet pebbles, a taxidermic triumph if ever there was one. Mrs. Henderson sucked in a breath, a hand fluttering to her lips. “Oh, he’s just like he was,” she whispered, fingers grazing the cat’s crown, tracing an ear that’d never perk again. “Like he’s about to purr.”

 

Sarah watched, tracking those trembling digits as they stroked a shell that couldn’t register the devotion flooding into it. “Glad it helps,” she said, voice a murmur, though her skull shrieked, *It’s not him, it’s a puppet, a pretty damn dummy.* Mrs. Henderson sniffled—soft, thankful sobs—mumbled, “It’s like a piece of him’s back,” forked over a wad of crumpled bills, and shuffled out with Mr. Whiskers cradled in a pine box, the bell tolling her departure like a full stop on a run-on life.

 

Sarah flopped onto her stool—a wobbly tripod she’d never fixed—and felt the day, the months, the whole wretched half-year since her mother’s last gasp, slam into her like a compactor crushing a rusted Ford. Her gaze swept the workshop: the fox, still eyeballing her; a half-done squirrel on the shelf, tail curled like a riddle; jars of borax and ethanol stacked like a mad chemist’s hoard. All these pinned-down things, all these stabs at bottling time, clutching what’d already bolted out the door. And then—*bam*—it hit her, a revelation sharp as a snapped tibia: she’d been doing it to herself, too. Those nights with the Jakes and Chads, the frantic fumbling in dim rooms (usually theirs, walls plastered with *Pulp Fiction* posters or acoustic guitars they couldn’t play)—that was preservation, wasn’t it? A frenzied attempt to pickle some shred of warmth, some proof she still pulsed, still mattered, still *existed*. But it was DOA every time—dead on arrival, like the fox, like Mr. Whiskers, primped and posed but numb to the world, incapable of plugging the gaping hole her mother’s death had carved out, or the older, quieter fractures she’d been digging since she was 16 and chasing boys who’d ghost her by dawn.

 

Her brain snagged on her mother—those porch-swing evenings, the woman’s voice a steady drip of insight Sarah had swatted away like a gnat. She’d been 16, pouting over some dick named Trevor (or Tanner?), when her mother said, “Honey, sex without love’s like drinking saltwater—it’s a rush going down, but you’ll be parched before you know it.” Sarah had sneered—*Jesus, Mom, join the 21st century*—but now, skewered by the fox’s glassy stare, it crashed into her like a semi through a guardrail. She’d been chugging saltwater for months, years maybe, slugging it back and wondering why her guts still twisted, why she still woke up dry as a desert.

 

And then there was Emily—college buddy, perpetual overachiever, who’d just swept back into town after an *Eat, Pray, Love*\-grade jaunt through western China and Uzbekistan, all sun-bronzed and smugly Zen. Over a chai latte last week, Emily had radiated—gushing about diving off jagged cliffs, watching pufferfish carve sandy mandalas like aquatic avant-gardists, swimming beside a whale shark so vast it broke her into a blubbering mess of wonder. Sarah had half-tuned in, swirling her coffee, thinking, *Swell, Indiana Jones, but I’m good.* Except she wasn’t, and Emily clocked it. For months, she’d been prodding Sarah toward therapy, tossing out nuggets like, “It’s not about being shattered—it’s about sorting the wreckage life dumps on you. Mental health’s a trek, not a straitjacket.” Sarah had always pegged shrinks for lunatics—the kind who saw demons in the drywall, not someone like her, who could thread a squirrel’s paw without blinking. But Emily’s yarns, over-the-top as they were, had lodged a splinter in her. Therapy, counseling, headspace tune-ups—they weren’t just for the unhinged; they were for anyone choking on their own brine, anyone who’d misplaced their own damn thread.

 

Now, with the workshop’s hush bellowing and the fox sneering from its perch, that splinter split wide. Sarah swiped her sleeve across her face—tears and grease streaking into a gritty paste—and felt a jolt—tiny, tenacious, not quite hope but its scrappy cousin. She couldn’t un-lose her mother, couldn’t un-bang the strangers, but she could quit embalming herself in remorse. Emily’s voice echoed, cool and sure, and before she could second-guess it, she snatched her phone. Fingers shaking, she tapped out: *Hey, that psychologist you mentioned—the one you saw pre-trip. What’s her number?* She hit send, pulse hammering, and dropped the phone, the fox still glaring as if to mutter, *Took you long enough, kid.*

i feel superhuman now, im levitating on mushrooms microdose day 3

try buying a slow juicer and i leave a ketogenic juice video for low carb candida dieter

the shrooms really cure depression but it takes a year with a on and off shedule to give the brain growing breaks, the shrooms are like a neuro steroid

i tried juicing for 3 days now and i am levitating , first i didnt like the juice i still dont care about the taste its kinda ok, pinaple and melon is what i do

but the  effects are sick first detox sympotoms now i wanna fast on it

so i recommend do one liter first 3 days on the first 3 days then ease into a juice fast of 3 days,

do liver flushes once or twice a week with a coffee enema afterwards see my other post for liver flushing info

if you want i can wirte messages with you or skype calls i read the 200 pages andreas moritz liver flush two times and have seen 100 hours of liver flushers online

ketogenic juice fasting  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww1bTDbXSck&t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww1bTDbXSck&t=5s)

be carefull with oxilates a bit

14 days of 10 nystatin a day brought me to where i am now with liver flushing totally wiped my body clean my spit is stil christal clear, i had candida

now i can eat wheat sugar and coffein again

ill keep updating here now im fucking levitatin on teh shrooms and juice and liver flushing

if you want to try this protocol i invented all you need is a cheap used slow juicer  
coffee,  
NAC serrapeptase nystatin psyllum husk as binder,  
charcoal and xeolithe makes me pale so i dont use it  
an enema device

the liver flush is more effective then anything i have ever tried it is the best thing i have ever done

pinapples and melons,

lemon for the flush and olive oil, or macadamia if olive makes you to nauseaus

shrooms powder for the happiness gains

dont be afraid of nystatin, jesus and nystatin is your best friend if you have candida,  
take 6 pills and get stomache cramps and watery diarea , thats what i got on the first dose but only on the first dose, then it is only depression and feeling like flu until its kinda bearable,

it cures candida in 14 days unlike s boulardi raw kefir and cloves that i tried

but the candida comes back, it is sitting in the liver in the stones, i had stones with white candida on it come out.

try this protocol i am living proof it works.

i keep you updated about the juice fast

1jdbye2,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jdbye2/i_find_keto_very_difficult_but_worth_it_ive/,"I find keto very difficult but worth it - I've battled high blood pressure, chest pains, asthma, bipolar disorder among other issues and nothings worked as well as keto.","Greetings!

I suppose this could be referred to as the ""keto review"" from my perspective, for my needs and I just wanted to share how amazing this diet type has been for me despite its massive difficulties, at least from my perspective.

So firstly, I got into keto for somewhat controversial reasons. I had a relatively large soft tissue tumour that at the time was being speculated as possibly cancerous. My MRI's results actually used the word ""probable sarcoma cancer"" which was terrifying. Now, in Canada the healthcare system moves very slowly and so I did my own research and thought to myself, what can I CONTROL about this scenario while I am waiting for referals, results and so fourth. Anyways - I stumbled upon a ton of studies that implied that keto lead to better outcomes, slowed growth of tumours and so fourth. I went really, really hard on keto for about 4 months and I can't believe how much it changed my life.

\- My blood pressure went down from approximately 160/95 to an average of 130/75.  
\- My asthma, for whatever reason seemed to improve a fair amount.  
\- My tumour, actually shrunk (granted, only .2 cm's but, still a reduction).  
\- Chest pains went away almost completely (minor pains if I drink coffee, for example, which i avoid now).  
\- Had 0 manic episodes during my time on keto despite being off my meds.  
\- Depression improved dramatically.

However, once I finally had surgery to remove my tumour, and it then got biopsied - I found out that, my tumour was non cancerous (though aggressive, but benign) and I ultimately dropped the keto lifestyle as the threat had been ""eliminated"" and boy was that an awful mistake.

\- Blood pressure went back up.  
\- Asthma got worse again.  
\- Chest pains were less frequent, but increasing in how often they happened.  
\- Mania and depression, or rather my bipolar symptoms got AWFUL.

Most of these weren't ""life altering"" except for managing my bipolar disorder. I've been on copious amounts of drugs trying to manage my bipolar, the most effective being lithium however, I wasn't doing keto nor taking my lithium and so I knew right away, I had to stick with and get back to a ketogenic diet so I could reap the benefeits and live a stable life.

Long story short, I am back on a less strict ketogenic diet today. Meaning, I've decided to incorperate cheese and dairy products into my diet while maintaining an under 20 net carbs on average daily consumption. I eat small portions of berries now, I eat lots of cruciferous vegetables but I do lather them in various sauces but I always make sure they have no sweeteners or sugar, I do however use stevia products.

\- Blood pressure is again stable, we're talking about cutting back on and eliminating meds for that.  
\- Asthma will always exist, but its more managable again.  
\- Mania and depression are stabalizing, they've been improving, its only been under a week since I got back on though  
\- I still take no bipolar meds  
\- I am effectively close to cutting out a need for meds, as least in the short term.

In short conclusion. I cannot believe how powerful this diet can be. Improved every single health issue I had at the time and continues to do so. I don't consider this diet easy by any means. I don't find myself in a position where I need to lose weight (in fact, I would like to possibly gain weight lol).

Questions!

\- Bodybuilders? How do you bulk on this diet? Just a clean bulk with an excess of calories? Slow and steady?  
\- What are some game changers for cravings you use regularly?  
\- Do you avoid artificial sweeteners?  
\- Do you avoid 1g of sugar sauces?

Seeking some advice on this coffee table I'm restaining. It had been in my family for years and we love the design but wanted something different from the yellow-ish tint. It had burlwood veneer on the top pieces - I sanded everything down pre-stained, then stained with miniwax walnut. It came out like absolute garbage. The stain didn't look right on the burl and the other wood (not sure what kind it is) came out way too dark.

Thus, here we are - I've decided to sand the burl veneer off and restain it from scratch, but i've been trying to sand out the darker grain for weeks now using 40 grit and I can't seem to make much progress. I've seen some posts about oxalic acid - curious if anyone things that would work here to neutralize some of the darker spots? Any help would be much much appreciated!

Here’s the hard truth: **we’ve equated manhood to manipulation**. We lie about who we are to get attention. We love-bomb, create fake connections, and sell women a fantasy just to trap them. Once they’re hooked? We drain them—their energy, their independence, their future. If it doesn’t work, we throw tantrums like toddlers. And then we high-five each other for ""scoring,"" never stopping to ask why so many women are opting out of dating altogether.

This isn’t masculinity. It’s destruction.

And honestly, it’s embarrassing. We’re out here demanding control, leadership, and respect, but how can we “lead” when we don’t even know how to *listen*? How can we “control” relationships when our idea of connection is transactional? We’re not rulers—we’re supposed to be partners. Supporters. People who create stable spaces for others to thrive, not vampires sucking the life out of someone because we’re insecure.

So here’s a radical idea: **What if we tried** ***actually*** **connecting?**

1. **APPROACH** like a human. Not a predator. *“Hey, I'm called Sebidde. That dress is incredible—you seem cool. Mind if I chat with you?”* No lies. No cheesy pickup lines. Just respect.
2. **LISTEN**—like, *really* listen. If she says she’s busy with lets say school, don’t see it as a ""challenge."" See it as information. Ask questions because you care, not because you’re strategizing.
3. **COURT** without ulterior motives. Send her a coffee during finals week. A nicely thought out succeess message, plan dates that respect her time. Show up consistently, not just when you want something.
4. **NURTURE** her growth. *“How can I support you?”* instead of *“How can you fit into my life?”*

This isn’t about being “soft.” It’s about graduating into actual adulthood. When we stop seeing women as conquests and start seeing them as people, we shed the toxic energy that makes us red flags. We become partners worth trusting.

And for the guys rolling their eyes right now: If your ego can’t handle a woman saying “no” without rage, that’s a *you* problem. The world doesn’t owe you control—it owes you nothing. Earn your place in someone’s life, or stay single until you grow up.

We can do better. Let’s start acting like it. I trust us

1jdblxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jdblxi/my_ex_said_hed_ruin_my_life_but_ended_up_ruining/,My ex said he’d ruin my life but ended up ruining a marriage and family,"Hey y’all! First time poster here and I have a lengthy story to tell. So sit back, grab some snacks and get ready for a doosey of a story in my opinion. 

For some context, I’m a 40 year old woman and this story took place in 2018.  I had recently broken up with a very toxic and abusive person in December of that year. Prior to that, I had started a new job as an electrical assembler. One of my friends whom I had worked with in the past was working there. She had been there about 5ish years I think when I applied. I’ll call her Marie for this story’s sake. 

After I was hired and had been working there for a few weeks, Marie made mention of her younger brother, let’s call him Brady who is 7 years younger than me. At that point of my life I wasn’t looking to jump into another relationship with a guy. I had seen Brady at work many times but he worked in a different department than I. However there were a few times when I had to go into his area for supplies for a job I was working on, and I’d catch him out of the corner of my eye “checking me out “. 

Fast-forward about a month and I’m waking up one morning and just casually scrolling through Facebook when I get a friend request from none other than Brady himself! I knew immediately in my head that as soon as I accepted his friend request, that he would start messaging me and my intuition was right because I no sooner accepted the friend request, then he started messaging .

 We were messaging every day and seeing each other at work in passing for a while. Eventually, he got up the courage to ask me to go “wheeling” with him. I’m a total tomboy so that was right up my ally. 

 A few months go by and we decide to start dating. In the beginning as I’m sure every girl will say, it was amazing. Typical honeymoon phase. Come 3 months in, I started noticing those red flags- asking me who I’m talking to, why are these guys commenting/reacting to your posts on social media, why are you wearing makeup-who are you trying to look good for? 
Did I also mention that he was living in MY apt, using MY utilities and eating MY food? 
He did help out with monetary things, but never paid any bills, hardly did any housework unless I bitched at him, and rarely cooked. To be fair, I wasn’t asking him to. I just assumed he would do at least the bare minimum 

 I knew I should have ended it there, but I had already fallen for him…..HARD! I’d always stand up for myself and defend himself when he would throw shade my way,  but very slowly, unbeknownst to me, he was starting to chip away little pieces of me. So small I didn’t notice- I was losing myself. 
I did everything he asked of me to show him how much I cared. I told my family about him, I dropped/blocked people for him. I asked for his approval with outfits I wanted to wear, made sure I had dinner fixed when he came home, made sure I always make enough coffee in the morning for him. I tore myself apart to make him happy. Little did I know, all my efforts were wasted. 

Everything came to a head in August 2018
 We were just getting up and ready for work. I put a skort on- and that’s where I apparently messed up in his mind. 
Here comes the accusations of cheating blah blah blah. Then he told me he was moving out. I told him fine, but I’m not helping you move. You want to degrade me like you are and then expect me to help you after?
After work, I came home to him having almost all his things packed. I honestly thought he was bluffing. I’m not proud to admit it, but I broke down and begged and pleaded for him to stay. No dice. He walked out my door while I was crying in the kitchen. 

He blocked me on social media, but I have my ways of finding out info on someone even if I’m blocked. Another not proud moment on my part but at that time I just HAD to know what he was saying or doing. 
Turned out after he blocked me,he wrote a few nasty posts about me and shortly after, was already in a new relationship, which I also found out that he had been talking to this woman while we were still together. 

Life went on and I myself found love again and was in a relationship as well and things were awesome- until Brady slid into my DMs. 

 I tried so hard not to fall back down that rabbit hole w Brady, but if I’m being honest, I still cared deeply about Brady still even tho I was with someone else. All his manipulation techniques worked I guess. Brady tried to get me to leave the man I was with and take him back. I wanted Brady back, but at the same time how was I to know that this time would be different.?

I stayed with the guy I was with for about 2.5 years until I realized that he and I are just better off as friends. He understood. 
 Once I was single, I let Brady know. However he had just gotten into a relationship with someone so I stayed away out of respect. That ended and he came back and we picked up kinda where we left off. 

 I wish I could say things changed, but they didn’t and for 6 years off and on it was a game to him. “Let’s take OP off the shelf for a bit until a shinnier new “toy” comes along at which point I’ll put OP back on the shelf and play w my new toy until I get bored or the girl  sees thru my bullshit and kicks me to the curb. Then, at which point let’s take OP back off the shelf again-dust her off a bit and rinse and repeat”

I commend you if you’re still reading and I promise I’m almost at the end!

The very last time I saw Brady was when I was kicking him out of my house yet again. Mind you, the whole 6 years of off and on, he would always stay at my house RENT FREE!

 The day of August 31st 2023, is a day burned into my brain. The morning started normal, but again where I “fucked up” in his mind was me taking my phone into the bathroom and closing the door to pee while scrolling on social media. 
Me doing that instantly made him think that I’m cheating/talking to other men. He left in a huff and I just finished getting ready and went to work. 

When I got home, he wasn’t there so I ended up going over to my besties who lives up the road from me. Got home a little after 7pm and then Brady arrived. I was in the bedroom, watching some shows when I can hear him fumbling around with stuff in the living room and then banging around some stuff in the kitchen. He then comes into the bedroom and just starts screaming at me “so what are you just not gonna fucking eat dinner?” To which I reply I’ve already eaten at my besties’s house and I even texted you telling you where I was. He goes back into the kitchen mumbling to himself. I walk out and ask “are you upset because I didn’t make you dinner?” His response: “Well fucking yea like come on you didn’t think that I might be hungry?” Me: “ I txted you saying I was at my besties house and to stop over cuz you were invited for supper “  To which his response was “I never got that message. You were probably doing something you shouldn’t have been.” I showed him my phone so he can see that I did indeed send him a text message, and He instantly grabs my phone and starts going through it. 

He finds nothing and seems to be a little upset about that. I have NEVER once cheated on him, never spoken to another guy that wasn’t in a platonic tone and I have never gotten all dolled up with the intentions of impressing a guy. I was faithful and loyal anytime he and I were “on”. 

 And at that moment, everything that I had felt for him,……all of the love……all of the respect that I still had for him instantly switched off. I was finally DONE with all of his bullshit. 

He was mumbling under his breath that he was just gonna move out that weekend to which I told him “no you can move out right now.” He and I argued some more to the point where I told him “you have two options, you can either leave on your own, or I can call the authorities and make a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be.” 
Cue nasty name calling, more threatening gestures- throwing my phone at me several times and getting inches away from my face with a butter knife as he had decided on making himself a grilled cheese. I knew that  this night‘s not gonna get any better unless I get some help so I dialed 911.

The whole time I’m talking to dispatch he is under the impression that I am just bluffing, that I didn’t really call the cops. I turned my phone to him to so he could see that I was in an active call with 911. It was only then that he started packing his shit . 

Three State Troppers  showed up to my house that night. Nothing got physical. Nothing got broken. I didn’t press charges or take out an ROAF on him. All I wanted was for him to leave my house. He packed all of his things in his truck and he left. Then, true to form, he blocked me on everything.
I was leaning very heavily on my bestie for support while I was going through this.  I met both her and her husband thru Brady as well as a bunch of other people over the years. Small town life. 

A few months after the breakup, my bestie stopped responding to my messages and she wouldn’t answer my calls This continued for almost a year and then I noticed her social media presence was gone. I couldn’t find any of her socials.

 At that time I knew she was going through some stuff in her marriage so I was trying to be respectful of that and give her the space. 

A year goes by and I still haven’t heard from her so throwing caution for the wind, I messaged her husband asking if she had deleted her social media because I could not find her anywhere. He read the message and then he immediately called me……oh boy

Come to find out that Brady and my best friend have been hooking up! Her husband filed for divorce in October. Upon hearing this, the only emotion I felt was just shocked. I wasn’t mad I wasn’t upset just shocked. I never would’ve expected something like that to come from her , but I guess find out who your true friends are. 

I’ve now learned that they are”engaged” have moved out of her mothers house to only move into HIS mothers house!  Brady told me when he left that night that he was going to ruin my life but whose life is actually ruined? He still lives at his mom’s house because  he doesn’t know how to manage/save money, can’t keep a job for longer than a year and is just a mooch. Now he can add ruining a marriage, a family and friendships to that list. So Brady, I gotta ask, whose life did you ruin again? ",37,1742215032.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,15,0.97,False

This Research and information hopefully can be beneficial in order to optimize the usage of the app to its maximum

As we all know, the adnoc distribution app is connected to our Emirates ID as when we create an account it would get it activated 

A lot of people have been familiar with the Adnoc points and the falcon tier points, but most people might not be familiar with them 

I’m here today to teach you how to earn maximum possible from the application 

First of all when you open an account you would be a 

Blue Tier 

As a blue tier you earn normal point every time you fuel your car 

As you upgrade to silver you earn 25% more points

Gold 50% more 

Platinum 100% more 

And as we know each 1000 point is equal to 1 AED 


3 points for 91 fuel 

5 points for 95 and 98 fuel 

10 points for oasis, car wash and other adnoc services 


So let’s pretend you fuel your car for 100 Dhs you would earn enough points that would equal to the points mentioned 

Now if you are silver you would earn 25% more points

Gold 50% more 

Platinum 100% more reward points 

Now what aloe of people skip is how to upgrade the tier from blue to silver and to gold and platinum 

It has a trick you need to focus at 

So basically to earn one tier falcon point you need to at least fuel above 75 Dhs 

Now adnoc distribution would give you one tier for that transaction 

Now accordingly you would think by fueling 150 Dhs you suppose to get 2 tier points 

But that won’t happen you will be surprised you would get only 1 tier falcon point

Therefore the trick is to do the fuel on separate transactions 

Another thing is that adnoc will allow you maximum of two falcon tier points per day until after mid night it renews 

Therefore my advice is to fuel 75 pay add points then again 75 Dhs 

That way you upgrade Quickly 

Now regarding spending in the oasis and other services it is unlimited earning on each 20 Dhs transaction 

Just make sure you separate the transactions 
 Means if your shopping is 45 Dhs make sure you make it 20 pay earn point then pay the remaining 25 to earn two tier falcon points 

Tier falcon points are not same as reward points that are redeemable 

So keep that in mind 

Adnoc distribution allow you to upload 5 invoices max per month 

Now if u do Salik or cigarette or Etisalat credit or whatever that doesn’t earn you reward points 

Still you can scan the invoice and earn the tier for it up to 5 invoices per month 


Refer to the photo attached to understand further about the tier

(Draw a line.

The angle's no longer 180°.)

**Early morning on a building site in the Hollywood Hills:**

*...the smell of coffee drifts over power tools, planks and sawdust, as a construction crew works on an actor's new house.*

“Yo, Angulo, gimme another measurement on that, yeah?”

“Eighty-nine degrees,” Angulo says.

“Fuck.”

“It was ninety yesterday.”

(It was.)

“What now, boss?” Angulo asks.

“We do it over,” says the boss, *but what he doesn't know yet is: it's not just this right angle; it's every right angle. There is no do-over.*

**A schoolroom:**

*...already the corners are closing in—as a boy draws the four sides of a square, measures the four resulting angles and finds:*

89° + 89° + 89° + 89° = 356°

= the new rectangle.

= the new reality.

*His teacher checks, but can only confirm the result. She tries with another protractor, another rectangle, another shape… to no sane avail.*

(The protector's dull plastic edge provides one way out, if you run it across the skin enough times—

*There's screaming as the paramedics rush in.*)

So what does it mean—this discontinuity of mathematics—this acutization of angles?

It breaks the mind a little, considering it; because if *this* can change, *what can't?*

Are *h, G, Λ, etc.* expirable?

Is the speed of light

**mortal?**

Are the physical constants inconstant—which age, degrade and disappear?

(“We are gathered here today to lay to rest the electron-fucking-mass.”)

Was a line [until now] always(?) 180° or was it once 181°, because [some say] that we may still resist insanity in a changing universe if we understand the change.

I don't know.

*We lack the data to know*—caught, ignorant—in the cubes and other angular shapes that today we've realized are mere snares of our own, unconscious making.

They are shutting on us like jaws.

Humans developed bear traps in the 17th century. Physically simple, primitively effective. Something steps on the plate and—

As a species, we thus find ourselves having put intellectual weight on a metaphysical plate working on the same basic premise:

Geometry,

whose false immutability deceived us.

It's too late to step back.

The arms of the so-called “straight” line are already closing, one ° at a time. Reality, as we foolishly conceived it, is being crushed.

**Deangularization:**

*the act of exchanging angular for nonangular shapes*

is a chimera. The circle and the sphere will not save us. We cannot huddle safely in rings or survive in orbs while all around us the angles slam shut.

Yes, today the circle may be steady at 360°, *but who knows for how long that will remain true?*

The right angle was truth too.

The line was truth.

**Sunset. The Santa Monica Pier:**

*A man and woman hold hands, staring at the horizon.*

*A hawker sells rocks.*

They've brought their own bag, one for the two of them, chained to both. Together they fill it—

(“I love you.”

“I love you too.”)

1jdbbzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1jdbbzp/i_found_out_my_boyfriend_was_engaged_from_his/,i found out my boyfriend was engaged… from his fiancée,"so i had been dating this guy, let’s call him D, for about six months. everything was great he was sweet, always made time for me, even did the little things like remembering my coffee order or texting me goodnight if we weren’t together. i wasn’t thinking marriage or anything, but it felt… serious.

then one night, i was at his place when his phone started blowing up with calls from someone named ""Samantha."" i didn’t think much of it at first, but when he saw the screen, his whole face changed. he declined the call, turned his phone over, and tried to play it off like nothing happened.

but something felt off.

a few minutes later, it rang again. same name. this time, he got up, walked out of the room, and answered in a whisper. that’s when my stomach dropped.

so, obviously, i did what any sane person would do I grabbed my phone and googled his number. first result? A wedding registry. HIS NAME, along with Samantha’s. wedding date? Two months away.

i felt like my whole body shut down. when he came back, i just showed him my phone and waited for him to explain himself. he stared at the screen for a second, sighed, and said “I was going to tell you.”

oh, WERE YOU??

turns out, they had been engaged for a year, and he had been cheating on her with me the entire time. she had been calling bc she found out about me too.

i left that night, blocked his number, and never looked back. but sometimes i still wonder did she actually go through with the wedding? bc if she did… girl, i hope you got a damn prenup.",0,1742214136.0,self,8,0.13,False

1jdbay0,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/1jdbay0/asking_for_over_a_hundred_cupsglasses_on_registry/,Asking for over a hundred cups/glasses on registry,"Mostly kind of funny and light hearted; like my mom still has some dishes that she got as a gift from her wedding and I think that that’s actually really nice to know that things last especially kitchen items and a lot of of these things are things that you probably wouldn’t spend money for yourself. I also have a lot of friends who asked for margarita glasses, or whatever on their registry, and it literally sits unused in the box for years, which is fine because you can do what the hell you want with your own stuff .I know some people in the etiquette circle think that it’s rude to have a registry, but at least it’s stuff that you asked for!! So keeping that mindset for those who defend brides on here: 

I just saw a wedding registry for an acquaintance and they had a short list of pretty regular stuff, including mostly kitchenware and dining items. I realized after scrolling like oh wow that’s a lot of fucking cups on the list… and they had just purchased like a one bedroom condo I believe. Somehow, on this registry, they have a set of 12 of every single cup, which is just fascinating to me. I think they might need a storage unit just to store these drink items. I’m talking water glass juice glass, margarita glass, martini glass, champagne glass, regular wine glass, stemless, red wine glass, old-fashioned cups, coffee mugs, tea cups, and clear glass mugs. Bahahaha that’s literally over a hundred cups haha and then interestingly they only want four pieces of plates and pasta bowls and cereal bowls, and salad plates hahahahaha

Giggled to myself (relax it’s not that deep for the registry lovers).

1jdb7wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1jdb7wz/maurten_caffeine_too_much/,Maurten caffeine… too much?,"I drink plenty of coffee daily, including a big cup before runs, and am very accustomed to using a few caffeinated gels during a run. Yesterday during a half marathon where I would normally have 2 to 3 gels with 20 to 40 mg of caffeine each, I actually took a Maurten 100 mg caffeine (in addition to earlier Gu with 35mg I think). So I got more caffeine than usual. I am also accustomed to regular Maurten and the Gu… so the only “new” thing on race day was the amount of caffeine being somewhat higher (though still less than adding extra cup of coffee). 

About half an hour after the Maurten I started feeling bad, almost more of a worry of vomiting, but I know that could be the feeling when your heart is pounding too much. I was definitely not running harder or faster than usual. I don’t really know what was happening, so I’m asking is 100 mg caffeine (as a quick dose) too much?",2,1742213749.0,Marathon_Training,9,1.0,False

1jdb6p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/realityshifting/comments/1jdb6p7/how_does_the_astral_body_instantly_appear_in_the/,How does the astral body instantly appear in the remote reality upon thinking the thought.,"If our astral body exists within the human body, how, when we think of a situation where we are interacting with the contents of the thought, do we instantly appear in the remote reality interacting with the contents of the thought, that we see thru the mind?

Our astral body would have to instantly teleport to the scene and instantly be interacting with the conents of the thought upon thinking the thought.

Example when I think of observing myself from afar, pedalling a bicycle down the street on a sunny day when the birds are singing and all the houses on either side have long lush green grass waving in the wind, and there's a cat prancing on the sidewalk purring very louudly. A couple houses down there's a old man sitting on his porch in what looks like a wooden lazy boy chair with his feet up reading the newspaper wearing only a red striped robe, with his wife standing beside him drinking a steaming hot white mocha latte in a fancy coffee cup with roses on the side of it, brewed in a personal push button espresso machine.

I am looking at the whole scene observing every detail as I focus in on each of the situations, like the cat is black, she's a female with white paws and an almost glowing golden tail, an extra large cat, like the size of a small tiger. The bicycle I'm riding is silver with a titanium frame and super wide tires. Unlike an average rim it has only three wide almost fin like spokes, the gears all switch automatically and operate with some kind of magnetic forces which adds ease and smoothness to the pedalling.

The question I'm pondering is how, if it's true as many of the books say - that the astral body is in the human body, does the astral body instantly appear pedalling the titanium bike down the street if the astral body first has to exit the human body? 

It's almost like the astral body is materialized along with the scene that instantly appears in the remote reality upon thinking it.",1,1742213641.0,realityshifting,0,1.0,False
