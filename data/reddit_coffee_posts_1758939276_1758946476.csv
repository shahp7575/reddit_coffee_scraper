1nrlr5i,https://i.redd.it/n8mhz0z4umrf1.jpeg,"Black Card, Red Lines: A jealous alpha billionaire romance with fake dating, fierce chemistry, and one unforgivable betrayal at midnight.","**He has the black card. She has the red lines.**  
Event fixer **Ava Reyes** runs on contracts, consent, and caffeine. Billionaire **Dante Voss** runs on control—and the most dangerous currency in the city: optics. When a weaponized “kiss” at midnight turns into a headline built from a lie, Dante offers Ava a deal she can live with: **fake dating, zero leverage, consent or nothing.** No surprise touches. No paid “romance.” No using her to soothe a board or feed a blog.

It’s supposed to be simple. Draft the rules. Survive the cameras. Land the Voss Gala contract and keep her tiny, over-the-laundromat office alive. But chemistry doesn’t read contracts, and the city’s gossip machine knows exactly how to crop a frame. One jealous look becomes a scandal; one sting operation becomes a war; one woman’s boundaries become the story everyone tries to buy.

Ava refuses. She **edits chaos into order**, turns “help” into **partnership**, and makes power behave. Dante, the man who could buy anything, signs what actually costs him: *her charter*. Ask first. Two keys or no go. We don’t burn bystanders for proof. When a fixer’s “midnight” is used to sell a lie, the grand gesture isn’t diamonds—it’s **governance**.

From red carpets and boardrooms to a bakery that smells like second chances, **Black Card, Red Lines** is a fierce, slow-burn billionaire romance where **consent is the love language** and jealousy grows up into protectiveness—with respect. Expect crackling banter, ruthless competence, ethical spice, and a heroine who can shut down a chandelier with a sentence. Expect a modern alpha who learns that wanting her isn’t enough—**he has to deserve her**.

If you love:

* **Billionaire + fake dating** that flips the power dynamic
* Slow-burn **spice** that’s hot *and* healthy
* Boardroom drama, PR wars, secret stings, and “who leaked the footage?” stakes
* A heroine with **rules** (and receipts) and a hero who **signs them**
* Jealousy → **protectiveness** (no cheating, no manipulation)
* A **HEA** delivered at midnight—with zero performative nonsense

…then you’ll inhale this in one sitting and text your best friend: *“Consent has never been this sexy.”*

**Trigger/comfort notes:** No cheating. Clear consent on page. Respectful heat (🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️). Found-family crew and a cinnamon-roll staff who make rules, coffee, and trouble. Final image: not a balcony scandal—**two shadows at midnight, hands threaded, nothing breaks.**",1,1758946239.0,u_Human_Bus_101,0,1.0,False

1nrlq0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1nrlq0f/first_cruise_on_silhouette/,First Cruise on Silhouette,"Me (26F) and my husband (31M) just booked a December cruise on Silhouette. My second cruise ever, previous was DCL back in 2017, and husbands first! 

We’re very laid back, travel frequently but decided somewhat last minute on a cruise because we hit a wall trying to plan our final trip of the year. There were so many options and we really wanted to just relax, so a cruise seemed like a great way to do that! But now of course, we realize that the options are still overwhelming… Would love some guidance! 

Trying to keep costs low, but we do want some premium experiences. I would like a spa service, and husband is leaning towards one of the bridge tours for himself. Recommendations on spa services and a ship activity? 

We want to do one premium dinner, while we love sushi, it sounds like the sushi restaurant is a miss… In between Murano and Le Petite. 

Not really huge on excursions, but any recs on relaxing port days would be great. We love history and don’t mind a lot of walking! Not beach people but enjoy the water. 

Husband is sober, and I drink very little. I don’t feel like a drink package is worth it for us except maybe the non-alcoholic package for coffees. But it’s nearly $400 for the two of us? There’s no way some lattes over 6 days will add up to that… Or am I missing something? 

Anything you’d like to add about how to plan and prepare so relaxing is easy! I don’t want to be stuck on the app checking available reservations, once we’re in the ship I’d like to see my phone as little as possible…

I know this sounds shallow but please hear me out. September is notoriously busy for my family as my little brothers bday is at the beginning of the month and mine is at the end. This usually means that one of the weeks will be filled with a mixture of events to celebrate each other. This September has been incredibly hard and mentally and emotionally draining.

Right after Labor Day I received a text from my best friend 32F telling me that her mom, who was my first real mother figure as mine dipped when I was little, had passed away unexpectedly in her sleep the night before. This completely shattered my world and because of this passing my month has been more stressful than usual while I try to help my friend get things together for a funeral. On top of it plans kept changing with my parents and little brother (13)on what his bday plans were. Originally there was going to be a party the weekend in between our birthdays. The next thing I hear there is no party.

While this confusion with my family was going and also with my friend, my boyfriend 30M was trying to plan something for my 29th bday. We decided that since my bday was on Wednesday we would leave dinner on that day open. Either we would go out to eat at a steak house, which he specifically suggested we go to, or we could cook at home and save the steakhouse dinner for the following weekend. THEN the Friday before my bday, my best friend lets me know the memorial service would be on the Saturday after my day from 4-7. This same day my bfs brother texts and asks for some cash because spouse had lost their job and they were short on rent. When that happened we sent over $400 and after doing so I looked at my bf and asked if my bday dinner could still happen Wednesday or if we needed to reschedule and he said “no I’m good on money and we can still do it then.” 

Now to Saturday before my bday, my dog gets a cold. Yep my sweet baby got a little sick so we had to schedule a vet appointment Monday morning. I called, got it scheduled and let my bf know. I also asked if he wanted to come with or stay home and he said he’d let me know when I get home to pick up the dog. I get off work and now have a raging migraine which is making it hard to see at all but I manage to make it home safely as I live 5 minutes from work. When I get home I let my bf know that I needed him to drive and why and he said “uh- I’ve been drinking since I got home I’m kinda buzzed” he’s a lightweight but had been home about 2 hours so he could have been one beer in or two idk. 

Anyways, since this was the case and I didn’t need to leave for another hour, I decided to get my car ready for my dog. Normally we use the SUV to drive my boy that way there’s only dog fur in one car, but I was in so much pain I wasn’t comfortable driving the bigger car. While I’m getting my car ready maybe 20 minutes goes by and my bf comes to find me. He asks what I’m doing and I tell him “I can’t see well and would be more comfortable in this car than that” he then tells me not to worry about doing that, that he stopped drinking when I said I didn’t feel good and he would be sober by the time we needed to leave. Fast forward, we were fine we got to the vet fine my dog is fine but was given meds and we were given a $300 bill.

My bf then asked if I needed or wanted any help with the bill and I said yes please. He pulls out his phone and quietly says “uh oh” and I’m telling you I knew the rest of the week was gonna suck. I asked what happened and he said he barely had $150 in his account and he couldn’t help me. I told him that was fine and asked again if my bday dinner (in two days) was still ok or did we need to reschedule since he got paid on Friday (today). He said “no we are still good for Wednesday” he looked really upset so I asked what’s wrong and he sighed hard before saying “I just didn’t expect this week to be so busy and it’s only Monday.”

I asked him to clarify what he meant by busy and he said “we had the vet today, your bdays in 2 days, we are supposed to do dinner with your parents on Friday (today) and then we have the memorial service Saturday. That’s a lot of things and a lot of people I wasn’t expecting to deal with all at once and I’m overwhelmed.”

I said I understood and asked if he wanted to cancel my bday dinner and dinner with my parents so that he could go to the memorial service and he said yes. Granted this bothered me that he didn’t want to do or go anymore but I also did completely understand. We all have different batteries and his runs out fast so if cancelling two dinners to have him when I really need him most, I was willing to sacrifice. Now Tuesday, I get a message from his mom with wedding dress ideas because my bf had mentioned wanting to take those steps and she found out so we talk. My bf has brought up marriage five times in our almost 3 years and each time it gets said “the o my reason I haven’t proposed is [insert excuse]” the first excuse was that he didn’t have money for a $1500 ring. I told him price didn’t matter and I actually showed him some ideas on Amazon that I loved and prices ranged from $30-$300 and they didn’t look like costume jewelry. He said a $300 ring is cheap and doesn’t show his love properly, and I just tried to drive the point home that I don’t need or even want super expensive I want something that is simple and beautiful. The next excuse was we needed to be “perfect financially and emotionally”. The last excuse was he has family all across the country that wouldn’t be willing to come unless we paid their way to get here.

Please correct me if I’m wrong but since when was it the couples responsibility to pay for other people’s travels. And I mean if we were talking a destination wedding in Europe then yeah that makes sense. I’m talking about this family makes multiple trips to Vegas and Miami each year I’m pretty sure if I gave them a year or two years notice that they’d come to the wedding that’s just a few states away. ANYWAYS why this is important, my bf often also quotes the movie Borat when the character says “My Wife”. Now my man does this in public and private so often people ask how long we’ve been married and it’s becoming increasingly hurtful because I want to marry him but he’s not taking the steps to make it happen. Well this conversation and multiple interactions on top of the death stress and birthdays I finally had a massive depressive episode. I came home burnt out and sad and asked my man is I could talk to him about something. He agreed and I said “I really need you to stop calling me your wife”
“When do I do that?”
“All of the time and a lot in public to the point most people think we are married”
“I can’t help what other people think”
“I’m not asking you too, I’m just asking you to stop saying it and calling me your wife until I am actually your wife. I feel like that’s an important title and we aren’t married yet…”
He rolled his eyes and with so much sarcasm said “fine I guess I’ll stop calling you my wife.”
I was stunned and just said nothing. A few hours of silence went by and eventually he asked if we could revisit the conversation.

I asked if he was more open minded to what I had to say as well and he got defensive and said “I wasn’t not open before”
“You rolled your eyes at me and gave me sarcasm when I tried to calmly open up to you”
(Same level of sarcasm) “yeah you said that’s what’s wrong so sorry I’ll stop calling you my wife until we are married”
We started to go back and forth for about 10 minutes before I finally broke and just said “you know what fine. I’m done with this conversation I’m choosing to let this go”

Bf: “well it’s on my mind now so we need to talk”
Me: “then let it be on your mind and go think about it. It’s late and I’m done trying to argue before bed. I’m tired.”

He then laid down in bed and faced the wall away from me. Since I assumed he was going to bed I turned off the light but left the TV on and laid down as well. Maybe five minutes later he gets out of bed and goes to the living room. I ended up crying myself to sleep alone because I was so overwhelmed by everything. Eventually I fall asleep and by the time I woke up my bf was back in bed with me. I know we went to bed upset and we woke up upset as well.

Wednesday (my bday) we said maybe 20 things all day.
Bf- good morning
Me- morning
Bf- happy bday
Me- thank you
Me- text saying made it to work
Bf- me too I love you
Me- love you too

You get it it was just normal texts. Now mind you I was upset about going to bed angry but I didn’t want to be angry on my bday and I didn’t want to fight. I was actually kind of excited because my bf had mentioned multiple times over the previous two weeks that he was going to get me some fresh flowers since my lily’s were dying. So with this little excitement in mind I was really hoping that I’d get some fresh flowers to smell as it’s always calmed me, but when I got home there was nothing. Now granted, he ordered me a cute blanket and socks with raccoons on them and they came in early so I got them then but I wasn’t upset about gifts I was genuinely said that there weren’t flowers. I didn’t know if he forgot or if he didn’t get them because maybe he thought that’d I’d assume they were apology flowers instead of bday flowers idk. But it bummed me out and I felt forgotten. We spoke very little last night and then today happened.

I’m home laying in bed after work waiting for 6:00 to come around so I can go meet my family for bday dinner. My bf is ocassionally looking over at me in bed asking if I need anything if I want any physical touch or anything and this was the first time I said no to all of it. I normally want to hold his hand or have his hand on my leg but I’ve been so depressed and upset this week that I didn’t even want my dog in my face or on my lap. Everything was overwhelming and I still had to fake being happy at dinner with family but I was cracking so instead of crying I shut down. I stopped talking I stop moving I just sat in bed and shut down. Eventually it’s time to go and my bf (who’s staying home) finally says “are you ok? Are we ok?”

Me: I don’t know I’m just very upset right now
Bf: why?
Me: because not once this week have I felt supported or seen. When I’ve opened up and been vulnerable you get defensive and mean and you keep saying you don’t want to disappoint me but you have. I mean fuck you couldn’t even remember my flowers?
Bf: you’re upset about not getting flowers?
Me: that’s not the only thing but yes I’m upset about it
Bf: wow okay didn’t know it was such a big deal to not get you flowers. I’m sorry I had to choose between a card and flowers I just didn’t have the money.
Me: you know if you had just said that, I would have totally understood. But instead I thought you forgot or didn’t want to because we fought the night before.
Bf: wow you know what I’m done with this enjoy dinner with your family.

Dinner sucked because the first thing my family did was ask where bf was and I’m a bad liar so my grandma called me out and I basically said “long story short we had a fight about him not showing up for me this week when I need him most” oh important side note I forgot to mention- he cancelled going to the memorial service tomorrow. So that means things that were scheduled this week:
1.Vet
2.Bday Dinner / Flowers
3. Bday Dinner w/family
4. Memorial service

Yeah the only one he went to or did was the vet. And the thing is this cancelling thing happens a lot. The other weekend he got me excited to go to spirit Halloween and coffee knowing that’s what I love and then the morning of said his back hurt to much and he couldn’t do it. I asked to go to the aquarium again, we planned a weekend- he cancelled because his shoulder hurt. Any time it’s something that involves going out of the house- unless it’s work he usually ends up cancelling unless it’s with his family or for him. So to say my feelings are hurt and I feel completely let down and alone is an understatement.

When I got home tonight I was in a better mood and he was sad and quiet. I asked if he wanted to say anything and he said yes but he didn’t want to upset me more. I promised to not talk until he said he was done and promised to stay calm. He basically said he didn’t realize flowers would be so important to me and he was sorry for not getting them. In his brain since we always did cards he thought I’d be more upset about not getting cards than not getting flowers. 

Once he was done I very calmly but while trying not to tear up, explained that it wasn’t just the flowers. It was the fact that this week had been planned out for at least a week or two and everything involving him fell through on his end and that made me feel neglected and unimportant to him and it overall made me feel alone.

He said “well I’m sorry I ran out of money and couldn’t get you flowers”

I said “if you had just told me that then I wouldn’t have thought what I thought. I genuinely thought you forgot or didn’t get them out of spite”

Him “wow I didn’t think I had to tell you I was out of money and couldn’t get you flowers. I thought you were better than that.”

And with that my mouth dropped. I started shaking from anger and eventually just got up, grabbed my water bottle and went into the bathroom and sobbed into a towel for 30 minutes. I tried to calm down but I’ve been sobbing off and on for 5 hours now. He’s never been so cold or hurtful with his words and that didn’t monte python “Tis but a flesh wound” type hurt, that was a stab to the heart type hurt and now I don’t know what to do.

I love him but what the fuck. I mean am I wrong for asking for that communication? It’s not like we don’t openly communicate about finances anyways so I don’t understand why he has THIS big of an issue with me asking for communication. AITA?",2,1758945770.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

They went for coffee together when they met up while she was on holidays (with her boyfriend) and he was working. 

She said this to my boyfriend:

“I had misunderstood how important (my name) is to you and I fully want to be supportive of (my name) being in your life long term”

This made me furious because he has explicitly told her we are serious and it feels like a pointless thing to say.

I got very upset and my boyfriend said I’m overreacting and should be happy about this because it is a positive thing.

Ben, bless his tech-nerd heart, had his VR headset and controllers perpetually sprawled across the coffee table, next to a mountain of charging cables. Chloe, our aspiring fashion designer, used the armchair as a launchpad for her latest fabric samples and half-finished sketches. I was no angel either, my stack of forgotten books and a perpetually shedding blanket adding to the chaos. It was giving ""abandoned storage unit"" more than ""cozy shared space.""

Tbh, I used to love chilling in the living room after a long day, but lately, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like an obstacle course.

But as Friday night approached, I looked around and realized there was literally nowhere to sit, let alone set up the projector. I was ready to declare a full-blown living room intervention. Ngl, I even considered just watching the movie in my tiny bedroom, which kind of defeated the whole ""shared living"" purpose.

That evening, I gathered everyone. ""Okay, so, movie night is tonight, right?"" I started, trying to sound calm, but my internal voice was screaming. ""But where are we even gonna *sit*? This room is kinda… taken over."" Ben looked up from his phone, seeing the mess with fresh eyes, ""Oh, wow. Yeah, it's a bit much, ngl."" Chloe, usually so focused on her designs, looked genuinely embarrassed. ""You're right. My bad, guys. I just keep meaning to clear my stuff."" That's so valid, I thought. We decided we needed a system. We set a 30-minute timer. Ben gathered all his tech into a designated box in his room. Chloe took her fabric samples and sketches back to her desk, agreeing to keep the common areas clear. I even tackled my own book mountain. We vacuumed, threw the blankets in the wash, and transformed the chaotic dumping ground into a proper, cozy movie zone. We even pooled some cash for a giant pizza order and a ridiculously large bag of popcorn.

Sitting there, laughing through a cheesy action movie, surrounded by my amazing, slightly messy housemates, I realized how much better it felt to just talk it out and work together. The room was clean, the vibes were immaculate, and honestly? We love to see it. It wasn't just about cleaning; it was about reclaiming our shared space and remembering why we chose to live together in the first place.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

1nrlklq,https://i.redd.it/cdtoicihsmrf1.png,Dog free spaces,"My son and I went to a playground this morning. It's fully fenced, and has signs on each entry clearly saying that no dogs are allowed in the playground, with the exception of service animals.

Yes the sign design is terrible, but it clearly states the expectation. I am now planning to redesign this myself and take it up with the council that their sign needs to be clearer.

My son is scared of dogs. We tend to go to parks which are fenced and have clearly posed signs saying that dogs are not allowed.

After we had been there for about 10 minutes an older couple (baby boomers) came in to the park with their large, stocky dog. When I first saw them coming through the gate I gave them the benifits of the doubt, thinking they might be taking a shortcut through the park, although it's only a small park and walking through would only take less than a minute off of their walk, but whatever.
No, they proceeded to walk laps around the park with their dog on a 4 or 5 meter lead, frequently under poor control and nearly pulling free of their grip, while they drank their coffees. The dog crapping and pissing multiple times all over the grass area. They did pick up the poo, but that's still gross I'm an area where kids are playing.

My son, doing his best to pretend he wasn't scared, kept climbing higher and higher on the play equipment.

I told these people that this is a dog free playground and asked them to leave. They then started yelling at me and recording me.

I called the police, and the council (because a council park is considered private property for some reason and the police can't remove them).

More families kept coming to the park. Several other parents noticed my keeping myself between my son and the dog, and made comments to me about people bringing dogs here often and how it is signposted as not allowed.

At one point the woman left the fenced area to go to their car (I hadn't noticed they drove here before that) and when she came back in the fence I asked her if she had read the sign on the gate, to which she told me to fk off.

Finally the police arrived and spoke to these people. They still didn't leave, but they did then stay near the fence where the police were. When I spoke to an officer he said that it does clearly say there are no dogs allowed here, but didn't say much beyond that.


I guess this is just a rant... But also to say I have a fear of large dogs based on being attacked as a child, and while I am trying to slowly socialise my son with dogs so he doesn't have the same fear I do... If you have a dog and it is not under control, coming at my son, I will do what I need to to keep my child safe.
In this case just staying between my son and the dog, and calling the police, but I was ready to be attacked to keep my son safe.",3,1758945651.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

1nrlitp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nrlitp/aita_for_dumping_my_best_friend_shortly_after_her/,AITA for dumping my best friend shortly after her wedding,"We have some history, so buckle up for context. It's a wild ride. I met who we will call M while we were 18 in college. My boyfriend G went to college an hour away from where I did, we live in the Midwest so an hour drive is nothing for us and we got to see each other all of the time, as much as college students can. G lived with 3 other guy roommates, one of them being his cousin T. Out of the house only 2 of the guys had girlfriends, G with me and one other guy, until one day T came home and introduced us to M. We were all so excited for him, as he seemed to struggle in that department, on top of that my first thought seeing M is wow, this girl is beautiful. She had the longest thick flowing hair any girl would dream of. As T and M lived in the same town, she was over there every time I came to visit. The guys lived in a tame yet somehow wild house at the same time. They were all gamers which was the tame part as often they were doing that, but on top of smoking pot also partook in occasional.. party substances. I did as well along with the guys, hey it was college. Seeing M every time I came to visit, and the boys being boys having their own bro time a lot, me and M became fast friends. We were interested in the same music, grew up in similar households, liked the same things. It wasn't long before we were constantly texting and having our own friendship outside of the boys. We went everywhere together, texted each other constantly, partied together, confided in each other. We were best friends in a few months. Me and G called it quits around our 2 year mark, it was teenage romance that burned hot and fast before being thrown in to the world and realizing we were going on different paths. But me and M stayed best friends, she respected that I didn't want to know what was going on with G and never brought it up, and even in my moments of weakness when I did ask she was vague. I appreciated it. 

It wasn't long after when G, T, M, and a few other people decided they wanted to do something new and exciting and took off far away to a coastal state to grow weed and generally be party stoners living out their dream. My breakup with G hit me hard, even knowing it was the right thing, it was the kind of love like that lingers in painful ways, but we were just not on the same path. M would reach out occasionally from their far away location, or send pictures of them in natural springs swimming, tenting, or them and the dogs they acquired on their journeys. Every time I saw G in the background of any of them it was like the wound attempting to heal would re-open and hurt all over again. But I was grateful for my friendship with M who was still with T, and that she was happy. I went on with my life, from dropping out of college, working at a restaurant trying to keep ends meet, partying, living my college life and trying to move on. In my hurt I got pretty hard in to pain killers to numb the existence that I hid behind a smile and cheerful demeaner. 

All the while things were not so good across the country either, M and T were always in disputes, M grew up in a very strict Christian household, and was finally spreading her wings to everything that felt taboo and denied to her the way she described it. T tried to stay with M, but M went off of the deep end in to harder drugs, multi peopled giggities in the woods, a poly relationship with another guy and girl while still with T, until those 2 decided to call it quits. By that time, T made his way back to the Midwest as he couldn't take it anymore, the group out there split, M went with the poly couple to a new area, and G stayed with a different group. Things kind of fell apart. I felt bad for my friend who was losing control, and whose family would try to contact me just to get ahold of her as her responses were scarce, and they were scared. 

One day M called me out of the blue, it had somehow gotten worse. She was on her way back home to the midwest, to stay with her family. While being with the poly couple, and multitudes of others, a guy SA'd her and she became pregnant. She did not want her parents to know, as she was going to be living with them to recover from the whole experience, and they being a deeply Christian family would never allow her the choice she wanted to make. She got all of the necessary tests, and terminated the pregnancy. It hit her, hard to say the least. Her whole world was crashing down, and she would tell me how alone she felt. I was in the middle of my then roommate moving in with her girlfriend, and I needed a new place to stay, so I asked M to come live with me and one of my guy friends as we were getting a house that could room 3. She excitedly accepted. 

At this time in my life, I had some scary moments of my own due to the drug use, and decided to get clean. It was hard, and it hurt. But I am 11 years clean this October and have never looked back. I am so proud of myself and my life is infinitely better because of that choice. When M came to live with me we were both 21, me turning 22. We were reunited, and in the prime of our lives. I got her a place to live with us, paid for her rent for a bit due to adjusting and her having zero cash when she came, got her a job with me at what was considered one of the best restaurants in our city, and did everything I could to put my best friend back on her feet. I was so happy I finally got to see her and we could now hang out all of the time. But that was short lived.

It wasn't long before I started to notice, patterns... she was still pretty in to drugs, which I was now in control of myself enough to never partake in, but I also didn't judge her journey. She had definite trauma. But on top of that, it started off occasional until I noticed every guy I mentioned how cute he was, or any guy messaging me, trying to meet up, who I would meet at bars, any one I showed any interest in she would sleep with shortly after, which in hind site saved me from a lot of mistakes, but took away my chance at it being my mistake to make in the first place as I am not the kind of girl to dip in the same pool my best friend is swimming in so to speak. The first 2 or 3 I thought well, maybe I am just slower to express my feelings, I never explicitly told her they were off limits, whatever I would tell myself to give her the benefit of the doubt. But by about the 8th guy this same pattern happened with who she went after I decided to put it to the test. This is where I got a little petty. Working where we did, there was no shortage of hot guys (girls alike, the restaurant just seemed to hire for that aesthetic it seems and not to toot my own horn but I am not ugly by any means), but this one guy I'll call J, had a good physique, unfortunately for him though that was about where the attractiveness ended. His face looked like sid the sloth from Ice Age. Very unfortunate. He was also a royal douche, not the kind of guy I would ever go for, nor M. Perfect for my experiment. I would make remarks here and there, ""Wow J looks really good in those jeans."" ""J is pretty hot the more I look at him."" and here's the kicker.. ""I think I really like J, he's off limits ok"" which she took somehow personally saying you can't claim dibs on guys. But I did, I set my fake boundary right there for her, and waited. Sure enough, 2 days later who comes over to our house right behind M, but J. I lived with M, and I knew exactly where this was going as soon as we said our hello's and they went straight up to her room, she had the sweetest smile on her face as if I had not told her to her face I wanted him, even if it was fake, and then I knew. So while M was up getting giggitied by Sid the sloth, it finally hit my trusting, young, naïve brain. She was my best friend who to my face comforted me, confided in me, and also has knowingly been stabbing me in the back. 

Fast forward, and I no longer attempted to even date. I was busy with work, and really got in to gaming with my other roommate who was also my friend, we just weren't as close as me and M. He knew it and did not take any offense to it, it was just a place for him to live. But our guy roommate had a friend, who he told us was off limits because they were good friends and didn't want things to get weird for him. Which something switched in me, and I wanted my time to finally have fun too. I should have respected my roommates wishes, but I was young and dumb, and definitely did not. We started seeing each other in secret, which made it hot for me, and because it was secret, M didn't know either. Until of course after 2 weeks she knew I was being weird, and confronted me. To which I told her, knowing, or hoping this guy thought of us as exclusive since he asked me if we could be. Both of my roommates were going to a rave a few states away with my guy roommates friend who I had been hooking up with and about 5 other people.  I declined the invite and decided to stay back as that wasn't my thing anymore and did not feel like being a babysitter. They were gone for a day and came back the next, all looking very haggard and raved out. The guy I was seeing was suddenly love bombing the shit out of me, and being way too clingy for a fresh 2 week old dating, whatever we were. Like, smothering me and suddenly always around to which of course our guy roommate now found out and was pissed. I ended things shortly after that, and the guy I was seeing became obsessive, stalking me to work, saying I probably cheated on him, driving by our house constantly, texting me horrible things one minute then begging me to see him the next. 

After about a week, M confronts me in the living room at night. She told me about how she is heavily addicted to drugs, has been selling her body for them, and needs to seek treatment so she is leaving in the next week to live with her parents and get treatment. My jaw dropped, I was so busy with work and my own life on top of subconsciously avoiding her I didn't even realize. I thought she was always out partying, so I had no idea what she did when she left the house. I told her I understand and I love her and I know she can get through this, heck if I could anyone could. I felt empathy for her. Shortly after, the guy I had been seeing was still persistent with multiple texts and calls a day. Everywhere from trying to bribe me to be with him to threatening me if I don't. Still stalking me, until one day I opened my porch and found a letter he had written me, stabbed in to our patio chair with a knife and a burnt cigarette spot. I called my parents, and they moved me in 1 day back to my home town. The letter itself was the same context, be with me or else. The knife I assumed was a warning. I was young and scared, and did not even go to the police, my dad told me a restraining order is just a piece of paper, and moved me out ASAP. I blocked the guy which I should have done sooner. Until 1 week after I moved back, and I got a text from an unknown number, my heart sank. It was him.

He used some app on the computer that generated random numbers, I blocked each one that came through, and decided to be safe I needed a new phone number, the day I was going to get one another text came through. Saying he really needs to tell me something, and he means me no harm but it will be really awkward if he has to contact me through one  of our friends to get through to me. I finally break and text back ""WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT.""   He told me he had chlamydia... and asked if I had given it to him. I told him no, he was the only guy I had been with in years, and I had been tested shortly before seeing him as Planned Parenthood offered them for free while I got my bc and I said sure why not. I had the results and everything to prove it. Which is when he caved.. at the rave, in their drug stupor and pulsing lights, M came on to him, and he cheated with her. I broke, followed by panic shortly after. The same day I went to get a new number, I got tested. The days it took them to get back to me felt like forever, until I got the call. I too, had it. They gave me medication, and tested me again a few weeks later. Luckily, it was curable. In that time M had not reached out to me, and I definitely was not going to to her. Until she called me out of the blue, over and over, months later. I finally answered. She told me her treatment was going well, and part of her process was apologizing to those she had wronged in her past. I was on that list. I told her I knew about what she had done. She was silent before admitting it, but says she wished I had reached out to her sooner so she could explain. She then got in to it, again, the trauma, the drug addiction, the depression, the feeling of no self worth and how she used men to validate herself. All of it, and I don't know if it was the memories of our long friendship, or the pity I felt for her. But I forgave her, and told her I was happy she was in a better place and doing better for herself. And stupidly, stayed her friend, again.

Months went by and I visited her, she was now a 6 hour drive away. Her and her narcotics anonymous group did camping retreats that she invited me to one of them. They were for the most part, wonderful people who all went through their own journey and got clean. That is where M introduced me to B, they met in NA. B seemed genuine, kind, and sparked full of life. On a clean path, and heading the right direction. He was in love with M, that was clear, and M seemed much better, also in love with him. I stayed in touch with M, and in the next 2 years I was now going to be one of her bridesmaids in her and B's wedding. B was now on the path to be a pastor, had his life together, a good job, aside from the oopsie background he was everything M knew she should be with and her parents wanted her to end up with. Their wedding was beautiful, and big. Our bridesmaids dresses were the same color palate but different designs, all very cute and flattering. She was no bridezilla, but was soaking up every moment of being the center of attention, as brides are allowed to do. A lot of planning went in to this day, and she was fawned over. It was a dry wedding, and there was a lot of fun things during it from fire dancers to artists, DJ, dancing, the decorations elegant and beautiful, and it was outdoors on a perfect day. It seemed M had finally found the blissful life she wanted, and had put her destructive tendencies behind her. Until when I visited her every so often, I again picked up, on patterns. We went to get tattoos together during one of my visits months later (don't do that, any of you) she got the sun, and I got a moon. Just cute little commemorations of our friendship. Our tattoo artist was a very attractive guy in his 30s, we exchanged snapchats, me because I was single and M because she said she was aspiring to get in to tattoo work. That was the first I had heard of it. Her now husband B was still studying to be a pastor, and she looked like the perfect grateful wife. 

I went back home, and never messaged the tattoo guy again, but would get random snaps of his latest work, his dog, fishing, whatever. Until one day he sent me a snap of a cup of coffee, a heart emoji above it, and who's face do I see just the corner of in the background, but M's. The snap he had sent me was a 7am just woke up morning coffee whatever one, and I don't think he checked his entire background. I double checked and did the awkward hold it down and replay it thing, and sure enough, I recognize that face anywhere, even just a small portion of it. I waited days before reaching out to her, but I eventually confronted her. She attempted to lie, and say she is apprenticing with him it was probably just one from the shop when she was walking by in the background, but I saw enough of his random dog snaps to know what his kitchen looked like as weird as that is. My brain just put it together, and she finally caved. M said she still felt insecure, talked about me in therapy and blamed me for some of her self image doubts (I am tall, thin, blue eyes, blonde hair. She was shorter, always a bit overweight but not fat by any means) and said she never felt like guys wanted her when we went out, they always went for me. She said it made her feel insecure. Which it now all made sense, every guy I looked at or even talked to. How I somehow convinced her I thought Sid the sloth was hot. She said she always loved me and I was her best friend, and yes she was seeing tattoo guy sometimes on the side. I never realized because I myself thought she was absolutely beautiful. I loved her, told her my secrets and me hers, we shared so many memories and deep talks. But she was still the girl who not only stabbed me in the back repeatedly, but somehow tried to make it my fault. 

Enough was enough. I hung up. I was just at her WEDDING and she was already sleeping with another guy, and I lived so far away I only know what she tells me except the short times here and there we visited each other. How many times had she done something behind my back that I didn't even know about, it's not like she ever told me, the things I knew are the things I found out from other people. How long had she lied to me, broken girl code, my trust. And forget my trust, what about her husband! I was fuming, and it felt like a fog had finally lifted. I loved her, and wanted so badly for her life to finally be good. But she could never keep herself away from doing things she knew were bad, because that's what made her feel alive. It was so toxic, I blocked her. I had B's number too, and I stared at it for a while wondering if I should tell him. But I had no proof, I didn't screenshot the snapchat, she talked to me on the phone about her confessions so I had no receipts, I would be that girl that comes around sometime's word, vs hers. Who she would probably twist in to me being petty and jealous of her, and he loves her so much, he would believe it. I dumped my best friend that day, blocked B, and didn't look back. Does he deserve to know, yes. Is it my place to tell him, no longer my circus or my monkey. I stayed snapchat friends with tattoo guy for a little bit after that, mostly because I had forgotten about him, but he snapped me a year later, just some tattoo he had just completed, and remembering he existed I blocked him too. 

I do not know what she is up to these days, I once asked about her while I was at another mutual friends wedding who she was not invited to, they are still married is all I got from it. I went on to reconnect with G, 8 years after our teenage breakup. He had been through ups and downs, moved to the west coast for a bit, me to the east.  We ended up back in our hometowns after I had gone to college and completed my nursing degree, he ended up working with some marines on a (legal) farm and straightened out years prior. When we met up to say hi and see how we were each doing, how weird it was we both ended up back, sparks flew like the first time we had met all of those years ago. He helped me move in to my new home in the town he lived in too where I had a few months prior accepted my first nursing job, which is where I ran in to him. He helped me move in, and never left. And I never said anything as I was happy he was there. We fell madly in love with each other, again, now adults and matured. We lived happily in that house for 2 years before I became pregnant, which we decided to buy a home together instead of renting, moved in with our dog and cat, and had out beautiful son shortly after. Me and G married a year later, and have now been together for 7 years and counting. I still love him deeply, and he is an amazing husband and father. I finally found my happily ever after, in my childhood sweetheart. To this day I have no idea what M is up to, but checkmate bitch.           ",2,1758945490.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

The wake was overflowing with people. Although the end of John's career and life was as tragic as it was strange. The mark he left was overwhelmingly positive. Extended family, friends, and even people he helped on cases attended. It was heartening to see so many people here to remember him. Due to the nature of his death, it was a closed-casket funeral. Even so, I wished only to see him in my mind's eye, the way he was before he disappeared, not what he became. The service itself was a traditional burial for an officer of the law. The bagpipes played as my fellow officers and I carried his casket, draped in the American flag, to his final resting place. I held my composure while saluting, as his casket was lowered into the earth.

It wasn’t until the service was over and I returned home that I finally let myself break down. I wanted answers, I wanted to hear from him an explanation for his behavior. But most of all, I wanted my friend back. But whatever hope there was for that was gone. Buried six feet beneath the soil in a wooden box. Tali tried calling me, but I ignored her. I wanted to be alone. It seems she understood, because she didn’t come knocking at my door that day. 

I spent the evening on the back porch, contemplating the events that just transpired. What went so wrong? It was all that bastard Howard’s fault. He went off the deep end, and his psychotic delusions dragged John down with him. Michel and Kaiden were still missing. Wherever John took them, we’d never know. The families had even more to grieve. That thought made me feel even worse. 

I threw another bottle into my backyard. I heard an odd noise as it collided with the ground, like it bounced off metal. Staggering towards the spot where it bounced, I found the culprit, a heavy metal pen, clipped to a small notebook. I recognized this notebook; it belonged to John. I hurried inside, not even bothering to clean up my mess. Frantically flipping through it, I hoped that maybe something inside would explain what John had been up to. The contents of the notebook contained a random assortment of information. Usually pertaining to a case, an occasional grocery list, or a guest invite list for Kaiden's birthdays. Even a section... about me. 

“The new guy I’ve been paired with seems promising. He’s got a mean-looking face, so hopefully he’s got the charisma to make up for it. It seems I’m finally getting the chance to mentor my own up-and-coming superstar detective. We’ll have to see, this assignment we’ve got is going to be quite the doozy”. 

Pushing the rising lump in my throat back down, I shuffled through more notes, eventually happening upon that damn drawing. Those black diamond eyes seemed to bore into me the longer I stared. There was nothing else written in the book beyond that. A defeated sigh escaped me as I slumped back into my chair. The rest of the night was uneventful; whatever horrors seemed to stalk my life decided to give me a break, a moment to grieve.  Such peace couldn’t last forever. 

Seeing as I had finally been taken off suspension, a fresh stack of assignments found its way onto my desk. Tali was happy to see me back at work. We’d grown close since she was first assigned as my partner, so I was excited to see what kind of detective she really was. Our first case was, surprise, another disappearance. 

“Is it me, or do people have a knack for vanishing in this town?” 

“That’s a good question, Henry; I’ve only been here for about a month.” 

“Fair enough. Alright, load up into the car, we have a stop to make.” 

“Can we get coffee on the way?” 

“Sure” 

The house we parked at was old, one of the older ones in the neighborhood. Ringing the doorbell, we were met with a middle-aged woman with obviously dyed brown hair. Her eyes were red and puffy, and she greeted us with a whimpering “Can I help you?”. After telling her we were detectives with the police department, she let us in. She tried to offer us some tea; I declined, but Tali accepted graciously. Before I even had a chance to open my mouth, Tali began to enthusiastically converse with her as if she were making friends. 

“You have a very lovely home, ma’am; It seems a lot older than many of the other houses in the neighborhood.” 

“It was built by my great-grandfather sometime in 1870. My husband, Gerald, never really cared for living in my old family home. But he knew that I loved it, so he never fussed.” 

“So, Mrs. Massani, what was Gerald like?” 

“Please, just call me Kathy. He wasn’t really one to talk about his feelings all that much. Aside from saying how much he loved me and our children. He was a good man; he worked hard to keep me and the kids comfortable. To think he’d run off like this, I don’t know what went wrong.” 

“You have kids? How many?” 

“I have two. My son is 19 and away at university in South Carolina, and my daughter is 24 and lives with her husband over in Maine. We speak every so often. I told them about Gerald's disappearance, and they’re both coming home as we speak.” 

They conversed like this for half an hour. Eventually, I had to nudge Tali to remind her what we were doing here. Giving me a knowing glance, she finally steered the conversation towards the case.   

“So... can you tell me anything about Gerald's disappearance? His behavior leading up to the day he went missing. Did he mention anything out of the ordinary?” 

“Gerald is younger than I am, only 46, too young to develop any kind of senility. But I found that he would often stare out our bedroom window towards the forest. I asked him several times what was wrong, and he would just brush me off. But it only started happening about 5 days before he left. He didn’t leave a note or anything, didn’t even take his wallet or keys. He just walked out the door and never returned.” 

The mention of the forest made me tense up; Kathy noticed this. 

“Are you alright, dear?” 

“I... I’m fine,” I replied, stammering. Sensing my discomfort, Tali interjected. 

“You said Gerald was a lawyer. I knew I recognized the name from the firm downtown. His name is pretty well known around this district. Not a very favored name, either, from what I’ve been told. Is it possible someone could’ve had it out for him?” 

“Oh... I didn’t even want to think about it. But yes, he has made some enemies and received more often than not some very unsavory letters. But they were all talk, no one ever did anything about it.” 

More questions turned up some answers, but even more questions. Eventually, we decided to let Kathy go so she could prepare for her children's arrival. Not before she showed us her photo album with pictures of Gerald. He was a very robust man, bald, and had a very large beard. Not someone you would miss in a crowd. Tali gave Kathy her personal number and said that if Kathy needed anyone to talk to, she would be there. After thanking her for her time, we crossed the street to the cruiser and got in to head back to the station. I had hoped for it to be a rather quiet drive, but Tali spoke up. 

“Gerald’s behavior is very similar to John’s. You think they might be related?” 

“I’m not sure. Following the patterns, it doesn’t fit. Howard had a wife and young son, and so did John. Gerald has two kids, and his son was off at college.” 

“So, what do you make of it then? Could be a copycat.” 

“Maybe, but the timing is too coincidental. Gerald began acting strangely five days ago. That’s the same time John died.” 

That was enough to silence her for the rest of the ride back. 

Sitting back down at my desk, I had Tali gather up a client list for Gerald Field. The first thing we’d do is sort through the list of potential suspects. We focused on prosecutors in cases he won, and clients in cases he lost. Even after our work, we had a very hefty list. It was hard to narrow it down; a lot more people were outspoken about their dislike of Gerald than we had thought. Interrogating that many suspects would take too many man-hours. We needed another lead. I didn’t even realize that it was starting to get dark out. I cut Tali loose an hour ago, and it was just me, the janitor, and the night crew. Sleep was starting to overtake me. Deciding not to spend the night in the station, I chugged a Monster from the vending machine and hit the road.   

I took the scenic route home; everything had gotten so depressing that I wanted to feel something other than upset. The twilight made the road a lot harder to see than expected. The forest's edge made the upcoming turn blind, and that’s when I saw him. For a split second, a large man was standing in the middle of the road. I swerved to avoid him, but my back tires lost traction, and I clipped him with the side of my car and began drifting along the shoulder. Trying desperately to regain traction, the left front fender smacked a tree, and the car was sent spinning into the woods. The vehicle caught a rock and started to roll over several times, and I was flung about like a rag doll.  When it finally came to a stop, I vomited all over my lap. The human body was not meant to be whipped around that violently.

I couldn’t open the driver's side door; the metal was too warped. The window happened to be shattered; the cuts and scrapes marking my face and head felt warm, and I could feel blood oozing out. In my dizzy stupor, I cleared the debris left over in the frame and pulled myself out of the window, landing flat on the ground. I tried to stand, but my brain was still catching up with my current position. Looking around, I could see that I was a ways off the road, the trek back would be hell, but no one would find me if I couldn’t call for help.

Dragging myself back to my car, I leaned in and shifted around for my phone. It wasn’t in there; the aux cable it was connected to was missing the phone and the plug. Looking towards the path of destruction, I doubted I would be able to find it, not in the dark. So, I began to shuffle painstakingly towards the road. Despite the cold, the adrenaline in my system made me feel like I was burning up.   

I was maybe 30 feet from the road, before a loose root from the ground snagged my foot, and my tumble made instantly clear to me that my right knee was shattered into a million pieces. The white-hot agony shot up my thigh and down my shin and centered in a fiery mass as I rolled around to see the damage. I faced away from the road, and that’s when I found out I hadn’t been alone.

Not 20 feet behind me stood a deer. My eyes had adjusted to the dark, and I could see the proud beast standing with its head high, its vision trained on me. His antlers were a complex growth of shifting and twisting vine-like bone. Many branches, many points, an undulating crown that seemed to bear no weight on the regal beast's head. As we locked eyes, I felt lighter, lost in the black abyss of its stare. Incomprehensible whispering filled my mind, isolating me from the rest of the world, drawing my attention solely to the enigma that stood before me. My thoughts were not my own, and I was forced to bow my head in reverence. Resistance was met with what felt like thorns wrapped around my brain. After a moment, trapped inside my own body, the whispers began to fade, and I felt as if I was being given control again. Either out of convenience or courtesy, I was given a brief moment of lucidity, an invitation to speak.   

“What are you?” 

The mouth of the beast opened, and a black, odorous vapor poured out. Its words were felt rather than heard. It spoke with many voices, that of men, women, children, speaking in ranges from hushed whispers to frantic screams. 

“The Kings” 

“What do you want?” 

“Dominion” 

“No... what do you want with me?” 

“Retribution” 

“I never did anything to you.” 

“A seat lies empty; your efforts have kept it so.” 

“What are you going to do then? Kill me, eat my soul?” 

“Assimilation” 

In my lucid state, I noticed that the buck’s face had gotten much closer, now only a foot from mine. The void smoke from his mouth was suffocating, my senses were purged, and I was left to focus on naught but the creature. I could feel myself slip back into the trance, with the short moments of free will I had left, I tried to pray. I wasn’t a religious man, but if there was a God out there, I begged him to save me from whatever this demon had planned.

Then, the thunderous crack of a gun rang out. Snapping me out of my state, I turned sharply to see a figure on the road, several flashes blasting from their outstretched arms. Snapping my head back, I could see my oblivion running away, wailing into the woods on its hind legs. Wasting no time, my adrenaline resurged, and I hopped up on my uninjured leg and hobbled towards the figure. As they came closer, I recognized it was... Tali? I didn’t even question why she was here; I was only happy that she was. Piling into her car, she floored it in the opposite direction of where I was headed, towards the hospital, again.   

“Henry! What the fuck was that?” 

“The Kings” was all I could mutter before the pain came back and my focus returned to the agony in my leg.   

Waking up after surgery, I couldn’t help but chuckle to myself. It may have been due in part to the morphine drip they had me on. But the fact that I was back here again after only a few weeks just really tickled me pink. I didn’t even register that I looked like a madman to the also now waking Tali. Upon seeing the weird look on my face, she grimaced, likely unsure of whether to call a doctor or a priest. Deducing that I was of sound mind, she called a nurse in to check on me. They said that I suffered a few bumps and scrapes, but my right patella, lateral condyle of the femur, and head of the tibia were fractured, I had whiplash, and a minor concussion. I was looking at about a week in the hospital followed by several weeks of recovery. I thanked the nurse, and Tali shooed her out quickly with “we have some case details to discuss, so we need some privacy”. After looking up and down the hallway, she shut the door and closed the blinds. and got up close to my bedside, handing me my hearing aids.   

“I'll ask again, what the fuck was that?” 

“What was what?” 

“Fucking everything, the freaky ass monster, the staring into the woods, that shit you mumbled about kings.” 

I looked forward, finally recalling the events of last night. 

“That’s what it called itself.” 

“Kings is plural Henry, that means there's more of those things out there. If I hadn’t shown up, you probably would’ve been eaten.” 

“I thought you said you didn’t believe in the supernatural.” 

“That was until I shot half a magazine into a talking deer with a twenty-foot-long neck! I need you to explain everything, and I mean everything.” 

I had hoped to keep her in the dark about all the stranger details, with Howard, John. I told her every detail, about what we saw at Howard's room, John’s obsession, the journal, and even the hallucination I had in my living room. Every detail was not previously known to her. Upon finishing my tale, she just slumped back in her seat, awestruck. I could tell the gears were turning; she was trying so hard to deny the reality of everything I had told her, but last night's events were all the proof she needed. Leaning forward, she sighed heavily. 

“They found Gerald. His body was found in a crumpled heap on the opposite side of the road, not far from where you crashed. It’s almost certain he was the man you hit.” 

“Fuck” 

Of course, the police had to take a statement from me. Given the circumstances, my testimony, and my being the only witness. Gerald’s death was ruled an accident, and I was free from any prosecution for vehicular manslaughter or a wrongful death suit. I still felt horrible. After finally being discharged from the hospital, I went to Kathy’s house to pay my respects, but she wouldn’t even come to the door to see me. Her son answered, he had a grim look on his face when he realized who I was, and said it was best if I just left. Tali helped me down the steps, and we got back into her car. She was off duty for the weekend, and I was on leave for personal injury. Even with the free time, we didn’t have a plan for what to do next. We sat there for a while, till Tali broke the silence. 

“What now?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Well, for starters, there are monsters in the woods, and they’re gunning for your ass. I’m no crackshot, but I sank enough nine mil into the side of that thing to at least slow it down. Instead, it got on two legs and ran back to hell or wherever it crawled out of.” 

“I don’t know what to do next, but I do know one thing: they can be killed.” 

“How do you figure?” 

“Before he started seeing things, Howard wrote that he hit and killed a deer. The one I met said something about there being an empty seat.” 

“Ooooh, perfect plan. Let’s just run over every deer we see, and maybe we’ll get them all, if we don’t run out of cars first.” 

“Funny... But there’s more. Howard's journal also mentioned a court, and I might know what he meant, or where he meant” 

I directed Tali towards a place that I didn’t want to return to, John’s house. The place was still empty, since Michel wasn’t missing long enough to be declared dead, the house still rested in her name, and thus wasn’t being sold. Though considering the things I saw, I knew the truth. The woods weren’t kind; the uneven terrain made it painful to navigate on crutches. Tali helped as best she could, but we were moving at a snail's pace, and I refused to let her get ahead of me, even in broad daylight. Eventually, we arrived at the clearing where I initially tracked John, and where I first encountered them.   

“The King’s court” 

“But it's just a clearing, what’s so regal about it?” 

“I’m not sure, but the night before, when you found me here. It was like I was somewhere else; I couldn’t see them, but I was surrounded. I think that standing here is how we can get their attention. If we can get them to manifest, we might be able to take them out.” 

“How the hell do you plan on doing that? Unless you can convince every hillbilly in the area to line up a firing squad to shoot ghost deer. We can’t drum up enough firepower to kill them all. And if what you say is true, you would have to stand in the middle of it all.” 

“Do you have any better ideas?” 

“We skip town, request transfers to new departments, or just quit our jobs and find something else to do. We’re dealing with forces beyond our understanding here, Henry. I’ve watched you almost die twice; I’m not doing that a third time!” 

“Then you don’t have to be a part of it. I tried to keep you out of the loop, but you just couldn’t stay away.” 

“If it weren’t for me, you would’ve been dead long before any of this got out of control. It is because of me that you’re alive, dammit.” 

“Why the hell do you care so much if you’re so damn willing to cut your losses and run. Why haven’t you done it already?” 

“Because of you, Henry... Because I care about you...” 

The blood rushed to my face as my mind went back to that night. The shock of everything that had happened since jammed the memory away, and I had completely forgotten.   

“I... I’m sorry. I didn’t realize. Let's go, we can talk about this later.”The drive to my house was silent. Neither of us wanted to be alone, given the circumstances. But things became awkward, and we didn’t really know what to say to each other. But I had had enough of being a coward, so I broke the silence; 

“I care too...” 

I awoke with Tali clinging to my back. My knee was sore, so I reached over for my painkillers. The commotion woke her up, and she squeezed even tighter.   

“Don’t go, not yet.” 

“We have work to do, get up. I’ll make breakfast.” 

I hobbled out of bed, still unable to bear weight on my knee, but I had to practice using crutches down my stairs. Without tumbling to my doom, I reached the kitchen and began cooking. Sometime later, Tali finally got out of bed wearing... one of my shirts. 

“One night and you’re already stealing my clothes?” 

“Mine are still at my apartment, and I think one shirt is adequate payment for dragging me into this mess.” 

“You broke my front door. Surely that cancels it out somewhere, right?” 

“Nah” 

Rolling my eyes, I continued cooking. We ate, and Tali left for her apartment to change and shower. While she was gone, I contemplated our next move. She was right, the most firepower I owned was an AR-15, and I doubted that would be enough to kill who knows how many of those things were out there. I turned to the internet, searching bluntly for ‘Talking deer in the forest legends’ and ‘Kings of the forest’. Aside from some unrelated YouTube videos on how to do deer calls, Wizard of Oz clips, and a 1912 short film by Colin Campbell, I found nothing. Tali eventually returned; she seemed to have a gleam in her eye. 

“What are you thinking?” 

“I might have an idea, let's go back to the court, I’ll tell you on the way.” 

I grabbed my crutches and hobbled out the door, making sure to lock it on my way out, handing her the new spare. After piling into her car, we hit the road, and she spitballed her plan. 

“You said that when you stepped into the court, it seemed like you were surrounded, yes? If that is a way to summon them, it might also be a way to get to them.” 

“And how do you suppose we do that?” 

“The only way to deal with a monarchy, burn it to the ground!” 

“You’re suggesting I light myself on fire?” 

“That’s the part I’m still figuring out. I think that if we construct a firebreak. We can lure the kings to their court, and while they’re manifested, we torch the place and hope it doesn’t cause a massive forest fire.” 

“That’s insane! What if it jumps the firebreak? What if I’m still stuck inside and I get incinerated with it? What if it doesn’t work at all?!” 

“I haven’t gotten that far, but I don’t want you in danger until we have something. Come on, we’re here.” 

I didn’t even notice that she drove us off-road a bit to get us closer to the spot. Looking up, I hoped that we were safe in the daytime; even then, I still didn’t want to step into the court. 

“Considering that these things can control minds and force hallucinations, don’t you think they can probably also listen in on this plan?” 

“Maybe, but they’ve been caught off guard before. They’re not omnipotent.” 

The clinking of metal from the back of her trunk caught my attention. 

“Tools?” 

“This firebreak isn’t gonna dig itself! Of course, I don’t expect you to help, what with the bum knee and all.” 

“No way, you’re not stepping into that place. What if you get caught up in the same bullshit I’m stuck in?” 

“I doubt they’re interested in me; they likely won’t come. Besides, they only ever seem to be doing anything at night.” 

“You did shoot one of them.” 

She shrugged and stepped into the clearing. Nothing happened, so I assumed her deductions were correct. I sat outside the court and watched as she hacked away at the dirt with a mattock she purchased from the department store on the way back from her apartment. Lining the inner circle of the court with about a meter width of tilled dirt and rocks. It took hours, but she was tough, and that’s something I admired about her. With that out of the way, we realized we only had a couple of hours of daylight left. We packed up the equipment and drove back to the house. We had the firebreak made, now we needed a plan to get them all there and burn it. We sat on the couch, thinking about how to end this all without subjecting me to a fiery demise. 

“I could tie you to the car and drag you out on a signal.” 

“I thought you were trying to avoid harming me?” 

“Considering everything you’ve been through thus far? You could probably take it.” 

“Hell no” 

We threw ideas back and forth late into the evening. Nothing new presented itself, so we called it a night. Tali came back inside from her car with an overnight bag. I eyed the bag, and she shrugged me off. Though a fiery passion wasn’t burning in our bones tonight, we slept in the same bed for a second time. 

I awoke in the middle of the night. Tali still rested beside me, but I could feel an overwhelming but familiar presence outside the house. I left my bed slowly, as not to wake her, and peered out my bedroom window. In the backyard stood the same, proud beast that I had seen before. With just a glance, it beckoned me to come outside, the whispers willing me to obey. Resistance was met with thorns. I begrudgingly walked downstairs, despite the instability in my knee. The pain was excruciating; I could feel the grinding of shattered bones and loose cartilage. When face-to-face with it, I was once again offered brief lucidity, an invitation to speak. 

“Your subversion is inadequate.” 

Through gritted teeth, I growled my words, but the pain forced an accompanying whimper that resulted in a high-pitched grunting. 

“Find someone else.” 

“The girl stands in our way.” 

“It’s me you want, not her.” 

“If you wish her spared, come to the court of your own will. Your anointment awaits.” 

I was let go from the trance, and the beast, with its head held high, walked away into the night. I stood there, truly alone for once, faced with a choice. Continue with our plan and risk Tali’s life, or give in to their demands and save her. I couldn't wait around to make the decision. I hobbled back into the house, being as silent as I could, grabbed my jacket, and went to the garage. Next to my lawnmower was the item I was most nervous about bringing, a canister of gasoline. 

Figuring out how to ride my bike with one leg was challenging, coupled with balancing a half-full jerry can on the back of the damn thing, it was almost impossible. But I managed to pedal slowly and safely to the spot closest to the court. Even before arriving, I could feel the eyes on me. They were watching. I placed the canister on the ground and stared at it, fidgeting with the lighter in my pocket. I knew I was being watched. If I betrayed them now, who was to say they wouldn’t kill Tali in her sleep, while I stood alone in the court waiting to spring a trap they wouldn’t walk into. I turned and left the canister on the ground. I couldn’t risk it. It felt like the path was forming itself for me, the vegetation clearing to make my march easier.

As I got closer, the pain in my leg lessened, but this time, it wasn’t accompanied by the whispers. My thoughts were my own. I reached the edge of the clearing; the fire break was still there. They either didn’t know what it was or didn’t care. I stepped towards the center of my own volition. There I stood, facing oblivion, hands stuffed into my pockets. The pressure was suffocating, my head felt heavy, and I wasn't alone, not since I entered this God forsaken place. The darkness seemed to creep in from the edges of the clearing. They were closing in, but they weren’t showing themselves. Until a familiar buck stepped into view, only 2 feet in front of me, dry leaves crunching under its hooves. 

This time, he stood taller than before. His height matched mine, and we were eye-to-eye. The black pools in his skull drew me in. I could feel myself losing control. Keeping my nerve, I tried to ground myself, forcing my eyes to the forest floor. The shroud enveloped everything. I was met with the churning black smoke that emanated from the beast's mouth. The increasing pressure in my head coerced me to look back up and meet his gaze. It lessened again, as I was given another courtesy, another moment of lucidity, an invitation to speak. 

“A promise made, a promise kept. The Fell will be pleased.” 

“Before you anoint me,” I mumbled, taking my jacket off. 

The deer bowed its head slightly, staring at the clothing in my hand. 

“Burn” 

My hands drew the palmed lighter and the gasoline-soaked jacket together, ready to strike. But as my thumb met the wheel, I felt the thorns. My nerves were on fire, my eyes set ablaze. The psychic struggle made my body feel heavy, but I was forced to stand. My muscles tensed, my tendons ached, threatening to snap. I fought against the control with everything I had, but I was slipping. Thoughts and memories of a life lived flooded through my mind, seemingly disappearing into a void; the beast was trying to subsume them, erase me. Whole experiences rushed past as they fell into the abyss. But as they began to catch up to current events, a new resolve glimmered within my growing despair. A dream achieved, a friend made, a love found. The joy, sadness, rage, and passion swirled to beat back the darkness, affording me one final push. 

My thumb twitched, sparking the flint and setting my coat ablaze. I forced my hand to let go, and the fireball banished the darkness below, revealing the dry vegetation that lay beneath. It lit the forest floor up and roared with more energy than it should’ve. The residue on my skin caught fire, and I became a part of the inferno. The deer bucked on its hind legs, screeching at the sight of the flames as it backed into the abyssal shroud that surrounded us. I could feel gusts of wind as the encroaching darkness wisped into a tornado, carrying the flames up into itself.

The screeching got so loud that, in my frantic flailing to put out the fire, I grabbed and threw my hearing aids out. I watched as the flaming spiral climbed higher towards the sky; the vacuum extinguished the burning clothes that clung to my body. The heat was intense, and it got harder to breathe. My muscles were weak; the struggle to take back my mind and get this far was too taxing, and I couldn’t move. It was over; whatever I did had the intended effect, but not the outcome I desired. The lack of oxygen made everything go dark, and for the second time, I fell unconscious in the court.   

A hoarse cough escaped me as my eyes struggled to stay open. The sun was peeking through the canopy of trees, casting a light on the face looking over me. 

“Tali...” 

Tears streamed down her face as she buried it into my chest. I grunted in pain at the sudden friction on my tender flesh. With a weak hand, I embraced her. Even with my partial deafness, I could hear her cries. After what felt like an eternity, she calmed down and pulled herself up along with me. While walking me away from the clearing, I turned to see that everything inside the firebreak had turned to ash, with a noticeable man-sized dent in the center. She had parked her car on top of my bike. I could see the skid marks from where she slammed on the brakes and failed to avoid running it over. She let me go, and I sat down, leaning up against her tire. The cool metal was a welcome relief against my raw back. The shifting to get comfortable caused me to wince. Tali handed me my bottle of painkillers as she joined me on the ground. 

“Is it over?” 

“I think so. I hope so.” 

“Why didn’t you wake me up? We could’ve finished it together.” 

“I couldn’t take the risk; they wanted you out of the way.” 

She didn’t say anything in response; she just leaned her head onto my shoulder and sighed deeply. It hurt, but I didn’t care. It may not have been the greatest idea, but I decided to forgo the hospital visit this time. Tali didn’t argue; there was no way to explain legally why I caught fire in the woods, intentionally or not. When I finally caught my breath. We loaded my crumpled bike into the back of her rig and drove home. It was quiet; the weight of our triumph wasn’t going to set in. We didn’t really know what we did, and we didn’t even know if we succeeded. The lives lost to their reign couldn’t be brought back, and our vengeance wasn’t even certain. If the kings were still out there, they were pissed. But for now, we just hoped that the nightmare was over long enough for us to leave. And eventually we did.

Tali never wanted to give up on being a detective; I did. Even after I ‘recovered’, I was stuck with a permanent limp due to excess use while in the initial recovery phase. This was grounds enough for me to quit police work entirely. I decided to start going to an online university to finish my degree and do something else with my life. She moved in shortly after, and we planned to sell the house and move to another state when the time was right. That was five years ago.

I now work a cushy job as a medical lab technician at our local hospital. We got married about a year ago, and we’re expecting our son to be due in 2 months. I write this as a memento of our experience. The event that brought us so close. But it's not the only reason. While I haven’t heard the whispers since then, sometimes when I look outside into the dark, it feels like something is looking back at me. ",1,1758945257.0,u_M7A3-CS-Riot-Gas,0,0.99,False
1nrlg4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nrlg4o/ro_heres_a_short_story_i_been_working_my_first/,[RO] Here’s a short story I been working (My first one- Genre: Drama),"The rain hadn’t stopped all afternoon.It clung to the glass of the hospital windows, ran in heavy streaks down the parking lot pavement, and filled the air with a weight Oscar couldn’t shake off. Thunder rolled far off, low and steady, like a warning. He sat in his car for nearly twenty minutes before finally forcing himself out, pulling his hood over his head. The walk to the sliding glass doors felt longer than it should have, like each step was dragging years of silence behind him.
He hadn’t seen Evelyn in almost four years. Four years of unanswered calls, words left unsaid, and memories that twisted tighter in his chest every time he tried to push them down. He’d told himself he was done, that the bridge between them had burned too completely to ever cross again.
But when the call came—her father’s gone, and she’s alone—something inside him cracked.
The antiseptic sting of the hospital hit him immediately as he walked in. The fluorescent lights were harsh, the halls busy with nurses, the smell of wet coats and old coffee lingering in the air. He almost turned back. Almost convinced himself she didn’t want to see him, didn’t need him, that showing up would only stir old wounds.
But then he saw her.
Evelyn sat slouched on one of the waiting room chairs, her hands twisted together in her lap. Her dark hair was tied back messily, strands falling loose around her tired face. She looked smaller than he remembered, shoulders bent forward as though the grief had settled right on her bones.
Oscar froze. Outside, lightning flashed, and for a long moment he stood motionless, guilt and longing knotted together in his throat. Then, as if sensing him, Evelyn lifted her head.
Her eyes met his—sharp, startled, then softening in a way that nearly undid him.
“You came,” she whispered, her voice raspy,
.
He nodded, words sticking in his chest.
Oscar moved closer and sat down a few chairs away. The silence between them was thick, the kind of silence that once had been comfortable but now was fragile, stretched thin by years of distance.
Finally, Evelyn broke it.“I thought… you wouldn’t.”
He turned to her. “I almost didn’t.”
Her lips pulled into something halfway between a laugh and a sob. “That sounds about right.”
A rumble of thunder vibrated through the building, echoing the tension that still lived between them.

Flashback #1
They had once been inseparable. Summers spent sneaking down to the lake after midnight, their laughter echoing over the water. Long drives with the windows down, music blasting, Evelyn’s hair whipping in the wind while Oscar gripped the wheel and stole glances at her smile.
But closeness made every flaw sharper. The night everything began to fall apart had been ordinary at first—a party, too much noise, a misunderstanding that spread like fire. Evelyn had caught sight of him laughing with another girl, a hand brushing his arm. She’d walked out before he even noticed, her pride too wounded to stay and ask.
When he tried to explain later, her words had cut him off like knives.“You’ve always got excuses, Oscar. Always a reason to make me feel like I’m wrong.”
And he, fueled by his own hurt, had shouted back.“You never trusted me! You’d rather believe a rumor than me.”
Outside that night, a summer storm had raged. Neither of them had noticed then, but the memory of it lingered with him now.

Present – Waiting Room
The silence between them now was heavy with that memory. Evelyn rubbed her hands together, staring down at the floor tiles. Rain pelted the windows harder, as if pushing them closer to the truth.
“I used to think you left because you didn’t care. That maybe… all of it meant nothing to you.”
Oscar clenched his jaw. A crack of thunder split the sky, startling them both. “I thought you hated me. That if I tried to come back, you’d shut the door in my face.”
She shook her head slowly. “No. I was just… angry. Hurt. And I didn’t know how to stop being those things.”
He wanted to reach for her hand but stopped himself. Instead, he leaned back, letting out a shaky breath. “So we both punished ourselves.”
“For nothing,” she finished softly.
Her voice cracked, and lightning lit the waiting room in a quick, harsh flash. For the first time since he arrived, Oscar saw her grief not just as something heavy but as something raw, something breaking her apart piece by piece.

Flashback #2 – The Break
The last time they’d seen each other before this day had been brutal. Evelyn had shown up at his apartment after weeks of silence, hoping maybe to fix things. But instead, the fight only burned hotter.
“You make everything harder than it has to be,” she’d said, tears bright in her eyes.
“Because I care too damn much,” he’d shot back, pacing the room. “And you—what do you do? You shut me out the second something goes wrong.”
Her silence had said everything. She’d left without another word. And he hadn’t followed.
When the door slammed, the rain outside had come down in sheets.

Present – Hospital
Evelyn’s hand trembled as she brushed her face. “My dad… he always asked about you.”
Oscar blinked. “He did?”
“Yeah.” A faint, sad smile tugged at her lips. “He used to say, ‘That boy loved you more than you realized.’ I didn’t want to hear it back then. I was too stubborn.”
Oscar’s chest ached. He had cared—more than he could ever admit at the time. “I left because I thought you were better off without me. Because I thought staying would only… hurt us more.”
Her eyes filled again, but this time it wasn’t anger. It was something softer. Something that felt almost like forgiveness, though not complete. Not yet.
The storm outside raged harder, lightning flashing across the parking lot, thunder rattling the glass. But in that room, something shifted.
Evelyn leaned just slightly closer. Her shoulder brushed his. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. Enough to remind them both that the thread between them hadn’t snapped completely—it had only frayed.

Climax
Tears slid down Evelyn’s face, and she finally let herself collapse against him. Oscar’s arms wrapped around her instinctively, holding her as she shook. Years of pride melted in that moment, replaced by something purer: the simple need not to be alone.
“I don’t know how to do this without him,” she whispered.
“You don’t have to,” Oscar murmured back.
Lightning lit up the room one last time before the thunder rolled away into the distance. The storm was breaking.

Resolution
By the time Evelyn pulled back, the rain had softened to a gentle drizzle. The air outside no longer carried the harsh weight of the storm but something calmer, like the world itself had exhaled. She wiped her eyes, offering him a look that was weary but steady.
“This doesn’t fix everything,” she said quietly.
“I know,” Oscar replied. “But maybe it’s a start.”
She studied him for a long moment before finally nodding. Then, without a word, she reached for his hand. He let her take it. Their fingers twined together—not tightly, not desperate, but steady. A promise, small but real.
For the first time in years, Oscar felt like he could breathe again. And though Evelyn’s grief was still raw, she leaned into the warmth of his presence, remembering what it felt like not to be alone.
Outside, the storm was gone. Only the quiet remained.

Chapter 1

My brother's company went bankrupt, and I became the debt payment sent straight to Edward Pierce, the infamous big shot in Elarwyn that everyone feared.

Everyone thought I was just a helpless sacrifice, but only I knew the truth. This was a carefully orchestrated gamble I'd been plotting for ages.

I was betting that Edward still cherished our past, that I was still the unforgettable mark in his heart.

For three years, I clung to him like a parasitic vine, tiptoeing around him and always acting the part of the gentle, obedient lover.

That was until those two stark red lines showed up on the pregnancy test. When I nervously asked if he liked kids, he just said, ""No, they're a hassle. And having one out of wedlock is even more trouble."" His words hit me like a bucket of ice water, crushing every last bit of hope I had.

But I never expected that just when I thought I could finally start a new life, running away with the baby growing inside me, Edward would come after me like a madman.

He cornered me in a foreign land, eyes red with fury, jaw clenched tight. ""The debt's not settled yet. You think you can just run? Not a chance.""

I'd stayed by Edward's side for three years.

Back then, when my brother Michael Linley's company went bankrupt and owed Edward a fortune, I became the debt payment.

Or at least, that was what everyone else believed.

Back then, the succulent I'd been nurturing on the windowsill for half a year had just put out fresh, dazzling green shoots. Michael's eyes were rimmed red as he said, ""Sophia, I'm so sorry.""

I patted his hand and said softly, ""It's okay, Michael. I'll go.""

But deep down, only I knew that this was mostly my own choice, my plan.

I'd had a crush on Edward for years; ever since he was just a nobody, a fresh-faced kid trying to make it in the world, long before he became the big shot in Elarwyn who could call the shots and turn the tides with a single word.

For those three years, I lived in his penthouse that overlooked half of Elarwyn. I was like a pampered canary, carefully looked after but always kept in a gilded cage.

When Edward was in a good mood, he'd bring me along to some not-so-important private parties. He'd introduce me in a vague way, and everyone knew the score; nobody ever asked any questions.

But when Edward got busy, it was perfectly normal not to see him for ten days, even half a month.

That night, I was half-asleep when I heard the soft click of the bedroom door opening.

Then, his familiar scent, tinged with a trace of alcohol, drifted over me.

I knew he was back.

I stayed perfectly still, pretending to be sound asleep.

Edward seemed to stand by the bed for a while, then lifted the edge of the blanket and quietly slipped in beside me.

His slightly cool, damp arms pulled me in, his chin pressing lightly against the top of my head.

""You've been drinking again?"" I mumbled sleepily.

I could already smell the expensive liquor and cigarettes clinging to him.

""Yes,"" Edward murmured, his voice rough and tired from a long night. ""Had to talk business, and just had a couple of drinks.""

I snuggled deeper into his arms, shifting around until I found a comfortable spot.

But he couldn't keep his hands to himself. His rough fingers gave my waist a gentle squeeze, then trailed beneath the hem of my pajamas.

""No, please,"" I murmured, grabbing his hand, my voice heavy with sleep. ""I'm exhausted. Let's do this tomorrow.""

Edward gave a low laugh, his chest vibrating against me, his warm breath tickling my ear. ""I won't be free tomorrow.""

With that, Edward rolled over, pressing me beneath him.

The curtains weren't fully drawn, and the neon lights slipped through the gaps, painting shifting patterns of light and shadow across his chiseled face.

\*\*\*\*\*

By the time I woke up, it was nearly noon.

Edward was long gone, and the other side of the bed was cold.

I still felt clean, so I guess he took care of me before he left.

Supporting my sore waist, I sat up and saw a glass of warm water and a sticky note on the nightstand. His bold scrawl read: \[Mr. Armstrong will come by this afternoon. There's a document for you to sign.\]

'Figures. More paperwork,' I thought, rolling my eyes.

It was always either some stock transfer or a pointless authorization form, not that I ever understood them, or even needed to.

I rubbed my temples and shuffled into the bathroom.

Looking at myself in the mirror, I saw that my face was a bit pale, with faint shadows under my eyes.

Just as I was about to brush my teeth, my stomach suddenly turned upside down. I gripped the sink, dry heaving a few times, but nothing came up. It just brought tears to my eyes.

This feeling was familiar.

My heart skipped a beat, and my hand instinctively rested on my stomach.

Last month, I thought my period was late.

At the time, I'd been too busy helping Michael with his new company to pay a lot of attention. Plus, Edward had been swamped with work, and we barely saw each other. So I hadn't really thought much of it.

My hands were trembling as I dug out an unopened pregnancy test from the bathroom cabinet.

Five minutes later, I stared at those two glaring red lines; my mind went completely blank.

The test slipped from my fingers and hit the cold tile with a sharp clatter, the sound echoing through the empty bathroom.

'Huh? I-I am actually pregnant?' I thought, my heart pounding out of control.

Edward and I always used protection, except for that one night. A little over a month ago, he'd come home from a celebration, clearly upset and more than a little drunk, and kept me up in bed nearly the whole night.

That time, we didn't use protection.

I leaned against the wall and slowly slid down to the floor, my mind turning into a complete mess.

This baby really couldn't have come at a worse time.

That evening, Edward came home unusually early.

He tossed his suit jacket onto the couch, loosened his tie, and walked straight to the liquor cabinet to pour himself a glass of whiskey.

I sat across from him in the armchair, fidgeting with the tassels on the throw pillow without even realizing it.

He took a sip of his drink, his gaze lingering on me, like he could tell I wasn't quite myself.

""What's wrong?"" he asked. His tone was flat, completely unreadable.

I took a deep breath, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Edward, do you like kids?""

His hand holding the glass paused for a moment, the ice cubes making a sharp clink against the side.

Then he looked up at me, his gaze piercing, like he was trying to see straight into my soul. After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice colder than the ice in his glass.

""No."" He didn't even hesitate.

My heart sank, and I gripped the tassels of the pillow even tighter.

He set down his glass, picked up a financial magazine from the coffee table, and flipped it open, making it obvious he didn't want to talk about it anymore.

""They're a hassle."" He barely spared a word, his eyes still fixed on the magazine, as if those stock charts mattered more than anything I had to say.

Seconds passed, and the silence was so thick I could almost hear my heartbeat.

Just when I thought the conversation was over, he flipped a page without even looking up and threw out another offhand remark. ""And having one out of wedlock is even more trouble.""

His words felt like a knife dipped in ice, plunging straight into my heart.

I could almost feel the warmth draining from me, my whole body turning cold.

I opened my mouth, wanting to say something, but my throat was so tight, not a single word would come out.

In the end, I just forced a smile worse than tears. ""Oh, I was just asking, you know, kind of curious. What would you be like if you had a kid?""

He didn't respond, just kept his eyes glued to the magazine.

I slowly stood up. ""I'm a bit tired. I'm going to bed.""

Back in the bedroom, I buried myself under the covers, and finally, the tears I'd been holding back came pouring out.

'Don't cry, Sophia. Don't let him find out,' I told myself.

'What would a patron do if he found out his canary was pregnant? I didn't even dare imagine it,' I thought.

At that moment, that last bit of unrealistic fantasy I'd been clinging to shattered completely, not even a trace left.

I thought it was time to go.

\*\*\*\*\*

A few days later, the weekend rolled around. Edward had an important business forum to attend, so he was out the door at the crack of dawn.

Left alone in the empty apartment, the place felt even more suffocating than usual.

My bestie, Vivian Downton, texted me, asking if I wanted to go out shopping.

Vivian was pretty much the only person I could be truly honest with these past three years.

She was in pretty much the same boat as me, kept by another powerful man in Elarwyn.

As she liked to put it, ""We're just two lost birds blown to the same corner of the world. No need for introductions when fate brings us together.""

We met up at the swankiest mall in the city center.

Vivian had just scored a generous allowance from her sugar daddy, Jason Grant, and was in high spirits. She grabbed my hand and pulled me along, shopping from the ground floor all the way to the top.

""Sophia, what do you think of this dress?"" Vivian held up a champagne-colored slip dress, holding it up against me. ""This color would look gorgeous on you.""

I just shook my head, not feeling it at all. That wave of nausea was starting to creep up on me again.

Vivian noticed right away. ""What's up? You don't look so great.""

She set the dress aside, her eyes full of concern as she looked me over, then gently squeezed my wrist. ""Have you been skipping meals again?""

I was about to say I was fine when, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of something, and my feet felt glued to the floor.

Not far away, in front of a newly opened custom suit shop, stood Edward. He was wearing a perfectly tailored dark gray suit, standing tall and sharp. 'Wasn't he supposed to be at that forum?' I thought.

But what really made my breath hitch was the woman standing next to him.

She was dressed in a well-fitted white dress, her long hair softly curled, giving off a gentle, elegant vibe. She was looking up at Edward, smiling, her eyes crinkling with her smile.

The sunlight poured through the mall's massive glass dome, bathing the two of them in a soft halo, making them look like they belonged together, almost like a perfect couple.

She wasn't his mother or his sister. She was a woman I'd never seen before.

Vivian followed my gaze, her face falling a little as she instinctively tried to pull me away.

The more Vivian tried to pull me away, the more uneasy I felt.

""Vivian, who is she?"" I grabbed Vivian's hand, staring straight into her eyes as I asked.

Vivian's gaze darted away, and she hesitated for a long moment. Only after I pressed her again and again did she finally lower her voice and say, ""I only heard a bit from Jason. That's Edward's first crush, Emily Monroe. She's a few years older than him and married overseas years ago. Just recently, she got divorced and moved back.""

'His first crush? What a joke,' I thought, the irony stinging.

A wave of sour heartache welled up inside me, so strong that it felt suffocating.

'I should be happy, right? The woman he really loves is back. Maybe now he'll finally let me go,' I told myself. 'I'm free now. But why does it hurt this much inside?'

""Sophia, are you okay?"" Vivian asked softly, her voice full of concern.

She watched me anxiously, gripping the edge of her sleeve so tightly her knuckles had gone pale.

I took a deep breath, forcing a smile and making my tone as breezy as I could. ""I'm fine, really. What could possibly be wrong? His first crush is back—good for him. I was just the stand-in, after all. Now that she is here, it's only right for me to step aside.""

I said all the right things, but only I knew how much it hurt—like someone was dragging a dull knife across my heart, one cut at a time.

""It was always just physical, never about feelings, right?"" I told her, forcing myself to sound calm.

Vivian let out a sigh, a bit of sadness flickering in her eyes.

'Yeah, who were we kidding? Caged canaries like us don't get to talk about love,' I wondered.

That afternoon, I just wasn't in the mood to shop anymore. I made up an excuse and parted ways with Vivian.

Instead of going home, I grabbed a cab and went straight to the hospital.

I checked in at the OB-GYN and sat on the cold waiting room bench, feeling like I was waiting for a verdict.

When I got the slip that said \[5 weeks pregnant,\] the world spun around me.

The slip of paper in my hand felt light as a feather, but somehow, it weighed a ton.

I walked out of the exam room in a daze, still reeling from this surprise, when I spotted the hospital director personally leading two people toward the VIP section of the OB-GYN department.

And those two people were Edward and Emily.

Emily was holding onto Edward's arm, her face lit up with a soft, gentle smile. Edward turned his head to listen to her, the faintest hint of a smile tugging at his lips.

The scene was so dazzling that it almost hurt to look at.

Before I knew it, I was trailing after them, hiding just around the corner in the hallway.

After about half an hour, they finally came out of the exam room.

Emily was holding her own test slip, giving it a little wave, her eyes shining brightly as she looked up at Edward.

They were a little too far away, and with the crowd and all the noise, I couldn't make out their conversation clearly.

But a few words pierced my ears like needles.

""This baby couldn't have come at a better time. It's the product of our love."" It was Edward's voice.

Emily's smile grew even brighter, and she excitedly hugged Edward's arm, clinging to him.

Edward was briefly taken aback, but then his features softened, and he reached up to gently pat her hand.

They looked like a perfect match, suited for each other in every way.

I slumped against the cold wall, feeling as if every ounce of strength had been drained from my body.

So, it turned out he didn't hate kids. He just couldn't stand the idea of having a child with me.

It was just because the mother wasn't the woman in his heart that he didn't want a baby and thought it was a hassle.

A sharp pain shot through my chest, my vision went black, and I almost fainted.

Luckily, someone caught me before I could fall. It was Vivian.

Vivian must have followed me at some point, but I hadn't even noticed.

""Sophia,"" Vivian called out, her voice trembling with worry.

She was on the verge of tears. ""Are you okay? Please, don't scare me like that.""

I just shook my head, unable to get a single word out.

My tears just wouldn't stop, falling like beads from a broken string.

Vivian helped me over to a chair and hugged me tight, cursing out Edward and Emily nonstop.

I heard her, but inside, I was just numb.

I was too naive. I never should've let myself hope for anything.

He only ever wanted my body, never my heart. Not once did he give me even a shred of real affection.",1,1758945145.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Also a fan of light to medium-light roasts, but I believe he prefers a lighter roast. Some of his favored previous choices came from Onyx (he raved about an SL28 from them before if I'm not mistaken, but it's no longer offered), 11th Hour Coffee (Theory of Everything). I noted that most of the beans he likes to try out have a fruitier note, which he acknowledged before as well.

Definitely open to any recommendations, especially if they may sound like it fits his flavor profile! Thank you in advance!

Around half a year ago I had similar pains for a few days, I ended up going to urgent care and they did an EKG which came back normal. I’ve been getting short bursts of pains a few times a day, switching between the left and right side of my chest (will leave a photo in the comments of where specifically). They aren’t crazy painful or anything and usually subside after a couple minutes, but I’m wondering if I should see my doctor about it at some point. I drink caffeine maybe 2-3 times a week, usually in soda but sometimes coffee. I don’t smoke or vape, and very rarely drink. No drugs. The only kind of medication I’m on is testosterone gel which I’ve been on for roughly 2 months, though until october of last year I had been taking testosterone in various forms for over 4 years (took an involuntary break because of scheduling issues with the doctor). I don’t have any medical conditions other than depression, anxiety and ocd. The pain doesn’t occur when I’m anxious or get worse with anxiety, so I highly doubt it’s linked to that. In terms of family history, my great grandfather had heart disease, both great grandmothers had type 2 diabetes, and both my grandfather and my aunt have had strokes.

1nrl5u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nrl5u3/wanting_someone_unattainable/,Wanting someone unattainable,"I (18f) have the most debilitating crush on my former english teacher (36f).  I’m not stupid, I know a relationship between us is not even remotely a possibility, I know she’s married and probably straight and far too old for me for it to ever be ethical. 
The thing is, she’s also been such an important presence in my life. We just ‘click’, honestly. I’ve had all sorts of insightful conversations about with her about politics and religion and she’s been incredibly sweet and accommodating when I opened up about my autism and how that affects me. (I’m almost certain she is neurodivergent herself) I’ve really felt seen by her. Twice, she saw me crying and took me out to the hallway to comfort me. When I was insecure about being overly clingy, she told me she liked talking to me, not just because it was her role as my teacher, but because she genuinely liked me. She told me that it was okay to bother people and speak up when I needed support. I guess I just really needed that validation (and, she’s objectively gorgeous), so of course I found myself falling head over heels for her. It’s not just as simple as that, though. She’s been such a genuinely positive sort of mentor figure for me too.

Fast forward to the end of my senior year, and I write her this long letter telling her how thankful I am for her, etc, etc. To be quite honest I definitely overdid it. I even drew a picture of her and wrote a poem on the back… none of it was explicitly romantic but looking back it was definitely bordering on inappropriate. At the end of the letter I gave her a few different ways to contact me (instagram, phone number, email.) I was terrified this would be the moment I finally scared her off, but a few days later she sent me a message on instagram expressing how she’d never gotten a message so sweet and she couldn’t find the words for how to respond. I saw her in person one more time after this and she seemed normal and happy to see me. I texted her a few times after this, though she disappeared off social media about a month into summer vacation. 

I was pretty torn up about this the entire summer, although I recognized it probably didn’t have anything to do with me. I realized how much I’d grown to be reliant on her presence. This was the first time the majority of my emotions around her became negative and painful. Although I tried my best to move on, a part of me was unwilling to truly let her go. When the school year started up again, I went to a coffee shop I knew she frequented, desperate just to see her. She seemed delighted to see me, she sat down and talked to me for a good while, where we caught up. She apologized for disappearing off instagram, explained that she’d realized how much less stressful it was off of social media (valid). I told her I had missed her, and she said she’d been considering emailing me but had been unsure about it.  

We had several more brief encounters after this— all very fleeting, because she’s the sort of person who’s chronically behind on things and extremely busy. They were nice, but I was really missing our longer talks. After talking with my therapist about this (who is privy to all of my complex emotions about this woman), I decided—very tentatively— to ask my old teacher if she wanted to read and give advice about some of my writing, and if she wanted to meet up some time to do it. Well, she turned me down nicely, explaining that she wasn’t sure she’d be able to find the time (and honestly I don’t doubt that’s true on some level, she is a very busy person who has kids and her job to handle), but that I could email them to her. 
It’s a completely reasonable response, but it’s been really crushing to me. I haven’t been able to even talk to her in the week since because it makes me feel like I’m about to cry. I had hoped that we could have something more than the fleeting minutes we get now, like we used to have when I was her student, maybe like a sort of mentor- mentee relationship. Maybe that’s impossible when I’m also infatuated with her, but I really wanted that. 

It all feels so impossible and my behavior is completely irrational but I don’t know what to do. I can’t make myself forget about her and cleanly move on, but I also can’t have her in my life like I need her to be. I feel like a gross person for being so obsessive over her and I can’t stop imagining how put off and uncomfortable she would feel if she knew the extent of my feelings which just makes me feel shitty. I wish I didn’t seem to only have the capacity to fall in love with completely unattainable women. I don’t even know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just need someone to talk to, but maybe that’s not what I need at all. I wish I could talk to her about all of this. If I was feeling this about any other person, I’d have told her everything.",1,1758944293.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

Our personalities are extremely identical and we regularly comment on how we're on the same frequency time after time again, reading each others' minds and whatnot. When her bf was around it was pretty clear she gave her attention to me not him.

I keep waiting for her to break up w him bc atp I thought that rls was done and over with. Valentine's Day comes around and she's still with him. ATP I crash out. I'd been talking to a girl and, the weekend after, I went over to see her. I didn't do anything, but it was pretty clear we were interested in each other. I told the girl this, and she immediately distanced herself from me a bit. I didn't care much for other girl and neither did she me, we broke it off. Two weeks later, I talk to the girl in question and tell her look I stopped talking to that girl because I wanted to show you that I'm not around forever, so pick who you want. Next day I'm blocked, as expected.

What was I supposed to do here?

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/s/EixFAtbne0)

“So….we’ve somehow ended up sixty-one years in the past”  
  
 Paula spoke in a voice which betrayed the bundle of nerves she’d become ever since she’d seen the date on the newspaper. It sat on the glass coffee table in our room as quiet as a church mouse, and yet the photo of a man who’d be assassinated a year later might as well have been a tornado siren. To say lunch, as delicious as it had been, had been tainted by an awkward, strained silence would be understating it. As soon as we’d paid the bill, the two of us had practically dashed back to the relative safety and privacy of our room to talk. And to try and wrap our heads around our current predicament.  
  
Paula finally stopped pacing and looked at me, wrapping a lock of her hair around her finger and biting her lip. “But…how?” she finally asked. I shook my head, unable to give her an answer she so desperately sought. I’m not a scientist by any stretch of the imagination; hell, I’m barely qualified as a manager for my company in the first place. “I honestly don’t know, honey” I said quietly, “Up until today, I thought time travel was impossible. Something only spoken of seriously by people nostalgic for an era they could never return to, or without both feet in reality. But…it seems *they* were right the whole time…” I trailed off, shaking my head as my mind fought to push away what I could plainly see in front of me to be true.  
  
I stood up and walked to the balcony door. It faced out onto the main drag, and looking down, I watched the endless procession of vintage cars move up and down the boulevard. *No, not vintage cars, Danny*, my mind whispered to me. *They’re modern for everyone. Everyone but you*. Turning back to my wife, I found her perched on the edge of the couch. She looked up at me, a mixture of confusion and worry filling her face. Crossing back over, I sat down next to her and wrapped her in my arms, sighing. After a moment, she pulled away, kissing my cheek in appreciation. “Look, however we’ve ended up in this situation, we need to keep a level head here” I said, “We need to keep calm and make sure, above all else, we stay okay” Paula stayed quiet for a moment, then nodded. “I agree” She stood up and began pacing again, a trademark sign she was deep in thought.  
  
“Okay, the first thing we need to do, is make sure we don’t stand out anymore than necessary” she continued, “So, we’ll call down to reception and ask where the nearest clothing store is. We’ll get ourselves some clothes to blend in with everyone else” She suddenly looked up at me. “But what are we going to do about cash?” I searched my mind for knowledge about the past I learned from hours of surfing the 'net. “Well, we’re already well set for money, because if I've done the math correctly, after what we spent on the room and lunch, we still have the modern equivalent of eight or nine grand left. *But*, I know that won’t last forever, so, I say, with a lot of caution, we try and bet a little money here and there on things such as horse and greyhound racing. Maybe even try some of the slot machines or card games. But not too much, though. Vegas in the sixties was - *is* - still as rigged as Vegas in the 21st Century, after all”  
  
Paula nodded, seemingly satisfied with my answer. “Well, that’ll possibly help. We have two weeks booked here, so we’ll be able to, hopefully find a way to get…” she trailed off and looked hard at me. “Danny, how *are* we going to get back to our own time?” I ran my fingers through my hair; she’d asked the very question I’d been pondering since lunch. I sighed. *It’d be so much easier if we knew how we’d gotten here in the first place. Then we could simply do the reverse to return…if that’d even work*. “I honestly don’t know, sweetheart” I admitted, “But, we’ll cross that bridge when we do” A lightbulb suddenly went off inside my head, and I shot to my feet like I’d been struck by lightning. “The elevator operator!” For a moment, Paula’s face remained blank, then the realization slammed home. “Of course!” she exclaimed, “He mentioned how others dressed like us had shown up before. That means others have accidentally traveled back in time, and they may have found a way back!”  
  
She smiled. “If we can talk to him, maybe others who’ve seen them before, we might be able to figure out what happened to them” I nodded, already having come to the same conclusion, and returned her smile. *And that is why this woman is my wife; she has beauty and brains*. “Until we’re able to, though, I say, let’s try and enjoy our time here. We’re in a time neither of us thought we’d ever see outside of pictures and films. So, let’s take it in while we can. Go to the shows, see the sights, do all we can, while we can” Paula grinned. “Took the thought right out of my head, darling” she said, crossing to me and wrapping her arms around my neck before pressing her lips to mine. “We always heard about the swingin' sixties, always wished we could have experienced them. Time to find out how swingin' they really were”  
  
Unfortunately, it turned out the elevator operator we’d seen that morning had left, also having the next week off, and wouldn’t return until the following Friday. So, in the meantime, Paula and I did our best to enjoy ourselves. It wasn’t that hard; In fact, 1962, especially in Vegas, was extremely fun. The two of us each bought several sets of period clothing as we’d planned. Wearing a suit outside of company meetings after a lifetime of dressing casually felt incredibly weird. But man, did Paula look stunning when she walked out of the woman’s clothing shop, clad in a tight, ornate white dress with straps which criss-crossed underneath her neck and a pair of high heels. “Wow” I breathed as she stepped outside and twirled around for me to see, causing her face to turn red. She looked nothing less than like a reincarnated Jayne Mansfield.  
  
My plan to try and make money off the casino games and betting actually worked out better than I thought it would. Paula always had been amazing at card games such as poker and blackjack, while thanks to my old man and his love of visiting the horse and dog tracks in the nineties and early 2000s, I’d picked up on how to, more often than not, successfully spot the entrants most likely to win. Between the two of us, we made over $3,000 in three days; more than enough to cover what we’d need.  
  
And to say nothing about the amazing shows we went to see. Watching legends of the previous generation such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., singers and comedians we'd bonded over a mutual love of, perform at *The Sands* was nothing short of amazing. Sitting in The Copa Room, filled with a hazy cloud of cigarette smoke as Old Blue Eyes and company belted out some of their biggest hits felt like a fever dream. The shows *The Dunes* had on were amazing as well. Arthur had been right when he said that Diana Dors had an amazing singing voice. When we sat down at our table and saw her walk out on stage that first night, Paula gasped aloud. For my part, so did I; The singer and actress looked uncannily like my wife. “You could be her younger freakin’ sister” I whispered as the lights went down. She simply looked at me, laughed softly and nodded. Apparently, we weren’t the only ones to have that thought; after spotting us in the audience, I saw Diana do a double take at my wife, before continuing with her performance like the professional I could tell she must be. After the show, she came over to introduce herself.  
   
“My dear, you and I are almost dead ringers for each other!” she exclaimed to Paula with an accent that instantly gave her away as British, clasping her hands. Almost instantly, the two women seemed to connect, a friendship blossoming with each other, to the point it ended with her inviting us to dinner with her and her husband. Who, to my shock, turned out to be Richard Dawson of *Hogan’s Heroes* and *Family Feud* fame. I’d grown up seeing reruns of both shows when I stayed home sick from school. Of course, seeing as neither of those things had happened yet, I had to keep my mouth shut and pretend I didn’t recognize him. After an amazing dinner, Diana personally extended an invitation for us to attend the whole of *La Parisienne* the entire time we were staying at the hotel at a specially reserved table, as her guests. And so, we made a ritual for the next twelve days or so, ending our days watching her sing her heart out. To this day, I can still close my eyes and hear her voice echoing in that room. I likely will the rest of my life. The two of us had an amazing time. Everything seemed almost too good to be true, too amazing and fun.  
  
Except for something I never told Paula about. Something she would have flipped out over, had she known.  
  
I only noticed it on the fourth day. I’d pushed the terrifying incidents from the parking lot and elevator out of my mind, in an effort to enjoy myself. In fact, I’d managed to half convince myself that the elevator incident had, in fact, been nothing more than a hallucination, and I’d simply lost my cell phone somewhere. But that illusion was shattered when we stepped off the elevator and waved to Arthur. Because someone stepped out from the shadows behind him. Just long enough for me, and me alone to see, before stepping back, seeming to melt away in the darkness.   
  
It was one of the black clad figures from my nightmare dash through what I could only describe as the hellish, nightmare version of the hotel. And as if to drive home the point that it hadn’t been a dream, I saw them raise their hand and wave something at me. Something which I immediately recognized, all the blood draining from my face. It was my smartphone. *Oh, fuck me*, my mind quietly whispered to itself as the figure vanished back into the black.  
  
After that first encounter, I began to realize that the two of us were being followed everywhere we went. Whoever they were, were extremely good about not standing out. They always acted inconspicuous, blending in with the crowds around them. I only caught onto to them when I began to see the same hats and coats filtering through the crowds. But they were always careful to never let me see their faces. They’d duck their heads, shielding their features with the wide brims of their hats. But they were always there. To say I began to feel paranoid would  be like saying the Cuban Missile Crisis was only mildly dramatic. I felt like a character in an Alfred Hitchcock flick, a mouse stalked by a cat which didn’t want to catch and eat it yet, but still wanted its prey to know it was there. I would manage to push it out of my mind when Paula and I began to have fun, but whenever I'd catch sight of them, the atmosphere would pop like a child’s balloon.  
  
By the following Thursday, my nerves were completely fried, and as much as I enjoyed it all, all I wanted was to speak to the elevator operator and find a way to get back home. Paula noticed, and when she asked what was wrong, I did something which I will forever regret. I lied. I told her it was just the stress of getting back to our time, not wanting to freak her out by telling her we were being tailed by God only knew who. I will always count that as one of my biggest mistakes, something done out of some fucking ridiculous sense of chivalry. If I hadn’t been so stupid, it might've saved us a lot of the horror still to come.  
  
The two of us had just stepped off the elevator, heading for what might very well be the final show in *The Dunes* we’d ever attend when we heard a voice call out to us. “Mr. and Mrs. Clements!” I turned to see Arthur beaming, waving us over. “You two are due to check out soon, I see” he said, looking down at the ledger on the counter. Paula and I exchanged a pensive look before I spoke. “Well, we’re not exactly sure whether we’ll be leaving on Sunday or not, Arthur” I said. Paula spoke up. “Yeah, you see, we may end up having more time to spend here than we first thought, and we may just end up extending our stay another week or so. That is, if we’re able to” I silently prayed we wouldn’t be told that our room was reserved; if it was, we had another problem to add onto our plate.  
   
But Arthur simply gave us his now trademark smile. “Absolutely, you two! We have no other reservations for your room for the next two weeks, at least. Just let me know before Saturday night if you’d like to extend your stay!” We thanked him, and with that problem solved, hurried to catch Diana and the rest of the performance. Even after seeing it so many times that I’d mentally mapped exactly when and where everything would happen, we still enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. When it ended, Diana came over and told us, not without a slight trace of sadness in her voice, that she and her husband were flying back to Los Angeles the following morning. Apparently, she was going to be appearing on a game show called *Stump the Stars*. It was a bit of a bittersweet parting, to say the least. Paula and her shared a hug goodbye, as did I a moment later.

“Don’t forget about us, okay?” I said to her after stepping back from our embrace. I hadn’t intended for the words which I'd whispered in my head to slip out, but they had. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Paula shoot me a concerned look. Diana let out a laugh, but I could see a bit of a curiosity flicker across her face. “Why, I don’t think I could ever forget either of you” she said, “Especially not where you’re married to my doppelganger!” I laughed in return, but for a moment, I debated about telling her the truth. About where Paula and I were from, *when* we were from, and everything in between. But I held my tongue, knowing it could end badly if I did. And so, the two of us bid her a safe flight and watched her leave the auditorium for the last time.  
  
“Come on, darling” Paula said, taking me by the arm, “Let’s get back up to our room and get some sleep. We have a busy day tomorrow” I nodded, allowing her to lead me back to the bank of elevators. Along the way, though, my head swiveled around like an owl’s, searching in all directions for any sign of our stalkers. But I saw no one. No men in coats and hats. In a way, it filled me with relief. But it also made me feel more on edge than ever. Not seeing hide or hair of them made it feel like something was up. *I pray to God it’s not. I just want to get up to our room and go to sleep*.  
  
The elevator let out its now familiar *ding*, and the doors slid open. To my shock, the man who’d been manning the elevator the last few days was gone. Instead, the young man who we’d been waiting to return was running the controls. Paula and I shared a surprised look, then both entered the elevator quickly. According to Arthur, the kid shouldn’t have been working again until tomorrow. *I don’t know, maybe he came back on a day early to cover someone else’s shift or something*, I thought to myself. *Who cares, anyways? This is our chance to talk to him!*  
  
The doors closed, and the elevator began its climb to our floor. I waited for a few seconds before turning to the man. “Uh, ‘scuse me?” I said. The man turned to look at me, and after a few seconds, his blank look was replaced with recognition. “Ah, hello you two!” he said cheerfully, “I see you managed to wrangle yourself up some normal looking clothes, huh? Have you two enjoyed your time here?” Both of us nodded. “Yeah, we did, thank you for asking” I said, then pressed on before he could say anything more. “Look, you said you’ve seen others like us before, right? People who seem out of place, dressed funny and all that?” The man nodded. “Yes, sir. Ever since I started working here three or four years ago, every once in a while we’ll get, well, pardon my saying so, but odd looking folks showing up. Management told me it’s happened ever since this place opened seven years ago”   
  
I felt a pang of surprise. *Ever since seven years ago…1955? People have accidentally wound up in the past from the present for that long? But…why did no one ever say anything about it?* Another thought crossed my mind, one which worried me. *Maybe they were never able to get back*. I pushed that thought away; I needed to keep my head, to keep asking the man questions. But Paula jumped in before I could. “Well, we just wanted to know…what happened to them? How long did they stay here? Did they check out and drive off like everyone else?” The man rubbed his chin as he thought. “Honestly, ma’am, I can’t answer *all* of those questions. I only work the elevators” *Shit*. I saw a look of disappointment fall over Paula’s features. But then the man continued.  
  
“*However*, I do know that many of them stayed only a week or two at most. Fourteen days was the longest I saw any of them stay. I did ask management a time or two the same questions you asked. And I always was told they did check out and left. The guys running the valet always told me their odd looking cars always left the parking lot. So, I can only assume that they *did* drive away” He gave us a bit of a puzzled look. “If I may be so bold as to ask, why did you want to know?” Paula and I quickly exchanged a look. Both of us immediately realized we’d walked into a situation we couldn’t easily explain away, especially with our specific questions. She shrugged at me as if to say *I don’t know what to say to that*.  
  
For a second, I mulled over our options, trying to decide what to do. But then, a single thought swam forward. *The hell with it. It’s time to come clean*. I turned to the man. “To be honest sir, I’m not sure if you’d believe me if we told you the true reason we asked them” I felt my wife grab my forearm, hard. The elevator operator raised an eyebrow. “Why don’t you try me?” he said, “I’ve heard all sorts of wild things in my time here. How wilder could what you say be than all of it?” Paula tugged on my arm harder. “Danny, *don’t*, we don’t know what’ll happen if we tell someone the truth!” I turned to her. “Paula, this may be the only way to find out how to get back” I said quietly, “As long as we only tell one person, I think we’ll be okay” She bit her lip apprehensively, but eventually nodded. I returned the gesture, then turned back to the man.  
  
Before I could even open my mouth, though, the elevator’s lights went out again, plunging us into pitch blackness. Instantly, my heart began to pound furiously in my chest as the memory I tried so desperately hard to push away surged forward. But this time was different. I could still hear Paula breathing, her gasps revealing the blackout had her slightly panicked. I felt her grab onto my arm, and a small amount of relief passed through me. “Stupid piece of junk” I heard the elevator operator mutter, and then he raised his voice. “Just give me a moment, you two. This happens every once in a while” I heard him step away and begin to fumble with something. “It’s alright, sweetheart” I whispered to Paula as I felt her press against my side.  
  
Before she had a chance to reply, though, another sound reached us. I couldn’t tell what it was exactly, or where in the elevator it came from. But it made my already anxiety ridden mind swirl with nightmarish images. Images of a black clad figure raising an axe to plunge into my skull. *Please, God no. Please, God no* I began mentally repeating. A moment later, my prayers seemed to be answered as the lights flickered back on, and with a hum, the elevator began to ascend again. I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding in and turned to my wife. “See, we’re okay” I said, smiling at her. Her blue eyes locked with mine, and she returned the smile.  
  
But only for a moment.  
  
I watched her eyes slide away from me, focusing on something behind me. I saw her face turn pale, and a look of utter terror replaced her relieved smile. She began breathing rapidly and backed up until her back was against the elevator wall. A colossal tidal wave of fear and dread surged through me at her reaction. I was beyond terrified to turn around. The woman was someone who didn’t scare easily, a quality of hers I always loved. So, to see her like this, only meant something truly horrible was now behind me. But I knew whether I wanted to or not, I *had* to look. Swallowing hard, I slowly turned.   
  
It only took a split second to notice the two things she had seen. The first was the elevator operator lay on the floor on his back. His arms and legs were splayed out, and for a moment, I feared the worst. But then I saw his chest rise and fall, and realized he was merely unconscious. The realization brought a microsecond of relief. But it was shattered by the second detail, which made me rapidly backpedal to stand front of my wife, arms protectively held out as if to shield her.  
  
We were no longer alone in the elevator.  
  
A massive figure in a black coat and hat, one which had been tipped down to hide the wearer’s face, stood almost directly where I’d last seen the operator. Whoever it was had to be at least 6’4 or taller. They remained perfectly still and unmoving as the elevator continued towards our floor. I shot the indicator over the doors a quick sidelong glance, seeing we were only four floors away from ours.  
   
And then, as the second to last floor passed, they spoke.  
  
“Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Clements” It was clearly a man, one who spoke with a deep, gravelly voice, as though he’d smoked two or three packs of cigarettes a day for years. And yet...for some reason, it sounded familiar. My heart practically *stopped*. *Our names…they know our fucking names…* “What….the fuck…?” I heard Paula breathe out behind me. Her words apparently amused the man, because he let out a chuckle, one which sounded like nails on a chalkboard. “Yes. *What* the fuck, indeed” he muttered, raising his hat just enough for us to see he wore a truly wicked smile, but not enough to see his eyes. I felt the elevator come to a stop as it reached our floor. I remained where I was, but I slowly reached my hand behind me for Paula’s. *We have only one shot to get out of this elevator alive*. Thankfully, I felt her grab it.   
  
“What the *fuck* do you people want?” I finally demanded. For a few seconds, there was silence, until I heard the elevator *ding*. And then, the figure spoke, all traces of humor gone from his voice. “I think you know, Mr. Clements” he said. *Oh, shit…*  
  
Before I had another moment to think, the figure turned and lunged for us, letting out a cry.  
But I’d already anticipated the man’s lunge and had been lying in wait. The second he exploded into motion, so did I. The biggest saving grace for us was that the elevator doors began opening as the man had spoken, and provided us an avenue to escape. I pulled hard on Paula’s arm, practically shoving her out of the elevator ahead of me. The man tried to course correct as we dodged, but he was far too tall, and moving too fast to do so. He crashed headfirst into the wall of the elevator with a rather sickening *crunch* of wood paneling and fell to the floor, his hat tumbling from his head and revealing his identity. I heard Paula let out a gasp as she stumbled to her feet.  
  
“The fucking *bellhop*?!” Indeed, the man who turned to look up at us with a mixture of frustration and hatred was the same bellhop who’d pulled our luggage from the trunk of my car the night we arrived. *You gotta be fucking kidding…* But I had no time to think beyond that. The man had begun to scramble to his feet. I dashed forward again, reaching around the inside corner of the elevator with a frantically searching hand. The raised round edges of the floor buttons met my fingers, and I slammed my palm down, hitting as many of them as I could while simultaneously kicking out at the man's face. He fell back to his knees and elbows with a grunt of pain. The elevator let out another *ding*, and I leapt backwards as the doors rapidly closed. The man leapt one final time for us, but a second too late; we both heard him slam into the closed doors and scream out in frustration. It was the same “Gah!” of frustration I'd heard the masked figure make in the dark version of the hotel.  
  
The revelation made me whirl around. I feared I’d suddenly see nothing but darkness around us, that we’d been sent to that hellish alternate version when the lights in the elevator had gone out. To my relief, however, I saw only the same regular hallway we’d become well accustomed to the last eleven days. As I stared, a door down the hall opened, and an annoyed, half-awake man poked his head out. “Keep it down, will ya? I’ll call security if you keep that damn racket up!” he said, before slamming the door shut. Paula and I exchanged a look, then dashed for our room. Jamming the key into the lock, I practically wrenched the door open, then slammed it shut behind us and locked it. Finally, I grabbed one of the sturdy chairs from the sitting area and wedged it under the doorknob. I knew it wouldn’t keep anyone out for long, but at least it would give us a warning.  
  
I turned around to find Paula staring at me. “You recognized his voice” she whispered, “I saw the look on your face. You recognized it” For a moment, I was unsure of what to say. But I knew I couldn’t hide anything from her anymore. Not where things had progressed to her actually being in danger. *I should’ve told her from the start*. So, I brought her over to the couch and sat her down, proceeding to tell her everything. From exactly what had happened in the parking lot the first night, to the nightmare hotel I’d experienced the second day. And about the figures which had followed us the entire time we’d been out and about. I saw a mixture of fear and anger cross her face as I told her. I knew she was upset for not telling her sooner. But, happily, she held back on giving me a tongue lashing.  
  
“So, what do we do now?” she asked after I’d finished, her voice shaking slightly. I shook my head. “I can only think of one thing to do” She looked at me. “Call down to reception, have them call the cops, and tell them…well, not tell where we’re from, but that we’ve been followed and attacked. In a way they’ll believe. We can’t deal with this on our own anymore” She began to play furiously with her hair, staying silent for a few seconds, then slowly nodded. “You’re right. We *can’t* deal with this alone” She locked eyes with me, the normally warm blue now ice, “*But*, while we wait for them to arrive, you and I are going to have a serious talk about hiding things from each other” I sighed and nodded; I fully deserved what was about to come my way. “Alright, let me call downstairs”  
  
Crossing to the bed, I sat on the edge and picked up the handset from the phone’s cradle. Spinning the single number for the front desk, I heard it begin ringing. After the third ring, the line was picked up. “Hello?” Instantly, I felt a wave of relief. It was Arthur. *I never thought I’d be so happy to hear another man’s voice.* “Arthur, this is Danny Clements in room 614” I said quickly. “Ah, Mr. Clements, I hope you and your wife enjoyed Ms. Dors’ last show!” he said jovially. “Yes, we did, thank you” I said, “But, I need to speak to you urgently” The jovialness seemed to deflate out of Arthur’s voice immediately. “Why, whatever’s the matter, young man?” he asked, his voice filled with concern. “We were just attacked in the elevator up to our room by one of your bellhops, the one who brought our luggage inside the night we arrived” I heard the man let out a surprised breath.  
  
“My, that’s serious, Mr. Clements” he said. “Yeah, you’re not joking. Listen, Arthur, I hate to do this, but I need you to call the police. Have them come to our room right away, please” A dizzy spell suddenly struck me, and I put my free hand to my forehead to try and study myself. *I must be panicking too much, gotta stay calm.* But Arthur’s next words seemed to intensify it. “I don’t think we need to involve the police in such matters, Daniel”  
  
A mixture of confusion and shock fell over me. “Ex-excuse me?” I stammered. Arthur’s voice spoke again, seemingly more calm and authoritative than I’d ever heard it before. “I said, I don’t think we need to involve the police in such matters, Daniel. Not when we can solve them ourselves” I stood up from the bed, feeling my legs almost give out from under me. The room seemed to spin. “The *hell* are you talking about, Arthur?!” I managed out weakly.  
  
“Exactly what I said twice now, Daniel” he said, laughing softly before continuing, “I thought you folks from the 21st Century were supposed to be *so* much smarter than us?” The biggest surge of terror flooded through my veins at his words. *He knows…?* “I think, what you two need is a good night’s sleep. We’ve already sent something up to help you do so, compliments of the management” As his words reached my increasingly sluggish mind, I became aware of two things. The first was that Paula had collapsed onto the bed, face down. For a moment, I irrationally feared she was dead. Then I realized she was merely unconscious. The second, was I heard the soft, hissing sound of something filtering into the room through the ventilation duct over the bed. *Gas…sleeping gas…or something….fuck…*  
  
Still gripping the receiver, I began moving towards the door to the balcony. One which now seemed miles away. *I need to…open it*. My legs gave out from under me, and I dropped to my knees on the carpet. Behind me, I heard the clattering sound of the phone’s cradle toppling off the table, and I fell onto my side on the floor. Darkness began to envelop the edges of my vision, rapidly moving inwards.  
  
“When you and your lovely wife wake up, you’ll understand everything” Arthur’s voice, now filled with a sadistic tone, filtered to my ears from what sounded like miles away, and he let out another laugh. Blackness overcame me, and as I slipped away, I heard two final words follow me down, spoken in a mocking, sing-song manner.

1nrl119,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd_college/comments/1nrl119/what_finally_worked_for_my_adhd_after_years_of/,What FINALLY worked for my ADHD after years of failed “hacks”,"I’ve had ADHD my whole life but only got diagnosed last year at 31. For years I tried every hyped-up productivity system, Pomodoro apps, bullet journals, “deep work” trackers, and failed so hard every time. Each failure made me feel broken. I wanted to share the random little shifts that finally clicked, just in case they help someone else too.

Body doubling was my first breakthrough. I started using Focusmate after hearing it on a podcast, and it blew my mind how 50 minutes with a silent stranger can keep me locked in better than any timer. Another game-changer was the “ugly first draft” rule. I literally tell myself I’m trying to write garbage, and somehow the perfectionism freeze disappears. Even deleting Instagram during the week made a bigger difference than all those fancy blocking apps, because reinstalling adds friction my brain hates.

When I dug into the science, I realized why these hacks worked. Andrew Huberman talks about how ADHD brains need external structure, light, movement, visible time. A quick 10-minute walk and then NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) primes my brain better than coffee. Russell Barkley’s research shows ADHD isn’t laziness but a need for scaffolds to externalize time and goals, which finally made sense of my late dx. That’s why I swapped endless to-do lists for time blocks I can move around. Even small sensory tweaks matter; gum plus a fidget toy gives my brain just enough extra stimulation to focus longer.

Resources that shaped me: ADHD 2.0 reframed my brain as different, not broken, it’s the best ADHD book I’ve ever read. Cal Newport’s Deep Work (NYT bestseller, insanely good read) made me rethink distraction, though I had to remix it into shorter sprints. Jessica McCabe’s How to ADHD YouTube channel felt like a survival guide made by someone who actually gets it. The Huberman Lab podcast gave me science-backed daily focus tools. A friend also put me on BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia team. It turns books, research, and expert talks into podcasts you can tailor, choose 10, 20, or 40 minutes, even pick your host’s voice. Mine is a deep one like morgan freeman, and it learns from what I listen to and updates my learning plan. One episode combined ADHD 2.0, Huberman tips, and McCabe’s strategies into a morning plan I still use. And the Modern Wisdom podcast with Anna Lembke explained dopamine so clearly it finally made sense why doomscrolling fried my motivation.

The biggest shift wasn’t one single hack, it was realizing ADHD brains aren’t broken. We just need different inputs, structure, and learning loops. And daily reading and learning have been the only things that truly rewired me. Knowledge really does change everything.",3,1758943856.0,adhd_college,0,0.8,False

Sometimes it’s hard to recognize what we do have around us — especially when our rights, and the rights of the most vulnerable, feel under threat. But maybe, together, even for just a moment, we can let it out and feel a little lighter.

Our team always did stuff very quickly. We would take tickets, help people, and usually finish in 5 minutes. Some take longer of course, but we figured out issues pretty fast for the most part. Every morning the customer service hub would have a bunch of tickets from after hour requests. We'd call them back and do any incoming ones, and then we'd have an empty ticket queue by the end of day usually. We'd work hard for 4 hours and the rest of the day was pretty easy.

Then the new management implemented a tracking policy that would measure how much time we spend on doing tickets. If we spend less than 90% of our time at work on the tickets (not including the half hour lunch and 2 coffee breaks), we are written up. Two senior employees got written up because at the end of day we did all the tickets and there was nothing left to do. They tried to explain that there is no more tickets to do but they're told to ""find more work to do.""

So we all found more work to do. Every ticket that could take 5 minutes, now took us 10 or 15. We had to look up EVERY avenue of problem solution after all. Calls and screens are not recorded, so all of a sudden the customer is asking us more questions that we have to find information on and explain. And all of a sudden our computers are acting slow and taking longer to load.

Now the customer service queue is full at the end of day and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Banging out lots of tickets isn't important to them, so we don't aim to do that anymore. Management keeps asking us why the ticket queue is full now. We shrug and say it's just how it is. They hired three new people to help with the tickets. But we are responsible for training them, and we made sure to teach them not to work too fast. We don't want them getting in trouble after all and the boss said ""take care of the newbies"".

I've been having some issues with my coffee grinder lately, and I thought I'd share my experience and solutions with you all. After doing tons of research and experimenting, I finally figured out why coffee grinders overheat and how to prevent it.

First off, let me tell you what happened to me. I noticed my grinder was getting unusually hot during use, and there was this burning smell that definitely wasn't my precious coffee beans. After investigating, I realized I was making some rookie mistakes that were causing these issues.

The main reasons why coffee grinders overheat:

1. Grinding too much at once
You guys, this was my biggest mistake. I was trying to grind enough beans for the whole week in one go. Big no-no! The motor needs breaks between grinding sessions.

2. Running it for too long
Those beans aren't going to grind any faster if you keep the machine running continuously. I learned to pulse the grinder instead of running it non-stop.

3. Using a low-quality grinder
This was eye-opening for me. My cheap grinder was working overtime just to do basic grinding. I recently switched to a better model from https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder and the difference is night and day.

4. Dirty grinder components
Built-up coffee oils and debris can make the motor work harder than necessary. Regular cleaning is crucial!

How to prevent overheating:

- Grind in small batches (30-second intervals)
- Clean your grinder regularly
- Let it cool between uses
- Invest in a quality grinder

Speaking of quality grinders, if you're in the market for a new one, check out these reliable options at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. Trust me, it's worth spending a bit more for something that'll last.

The biggest game-changer for me was learning to listen to my grinder. When it starts sounding different or struggling, that's usually a sign it needs a break.

Pro tip: If you're grinding for multiple cups, divide your beans into smaller portions and give your grinder a 30-second rest between each batch. This has worked wonders for me!

Remember, taking care of your grinder isn't just about preventing overheating - it's about getting the best possible cup of coffee. Nobody wants burnt-tasting coffee because their grinder overheated during the process.

1nrks3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1nrks3b/i_tried_writing_for_the_first_time/,I tried writing for the first time,"Coffee and her.

I watched the dew trace delicate lines along the window, yet the glass remained clear. Her voice lingered in the bitterness of the coffee - not the harsh, unpleasant kind, but the kind of bitterness that draws you in, makes you crave it. She was a coffee person; I was not. Chai was my comfort, my ritual, my cup of tea. 
My room has two chairs, I only use one.
The other stays in the corner, collecting dust, as if waiting for her to return. I never touched it. Some absences must remain untouched, like wounds that refuse bandages.

Love, I have decided, is not a flame as poets say. It's not fire or light. It's a parasite. It enters quickly, feeds endlessly and when it leaves, it leaves scars in the name of absence. To love is to volunteer for ruin, yet I would volunteer again if she asked. That is the sickness. That is the truth.

 On our first date, we went to a café after I had the numbers 11:11 inked on my right wrist. I don’t know if it was impulse or destiny, but something about those digits felt like a wish pressed into skin, a reminder that even time has moments meant only for us. She looked at it and smiled, tracing the fresh ink with her eyes, not her fingers. It stung, the tattoo, but her gaze numbed it. Pain felt holy when she noticed.

 She ordered cold coffee, the kind that clinks with ice and laughs in the glass. I ordered South Indian filter coffee, hot and steady, bitter and grounding. Even then, we were opposites. She carried the chill of mischief, I carried the warmth of ritual. Between us sat two cups, two worlds, yet one table. One silence, heavy and new, but alive. 

I didn’t know then that the tattoo would scar into more than skin. That 11:11 would stop being a number and start being her, the wish I made, the wish I lost, the wish I keep drinking to every morning.

That day, I realized something simple. Love doesn’t announce itself with thunder, it hides in small details. In the way she tilted her head when she listened, in the way her eyes lingered just long enough to make me nervous.

I sip, but it doesn’t taste the same. Coffee was never really about the drink, it was about her across the table, about the way her presence sweetened even the bitterest brew. Without her, it’s just liquid, just time passing through my hands.

Around me, strangers laugh, spoons clink, life goes on. But at my table there is only silence. My cup is full, but I am empty. Every sip is a reminder that I’m not sharing it with her, that I’m sipping memories, not coffee.

So I sit here, nursing what’s left in the glass, staring at the empty chair across from me. The world sees a man drinking his morning coffee. I know better. I’m just drinking to her.

I just found out that my BF has been texting with this girl named Ayla on WhatsApp for roughly 3 months, which he claimed to know her from a dating app.

The moment I discovered it all out, my heart was broken into pieces and I couldn't think much more. As now i'm a bit more emotionally stable, I reckon I had seen signs which may suggest he's in a romance scam.

1. Multiple Binance transactional emails and
Revolut
- I started to see these emails around the time he started texting this girl. And lately found out he's been borrowing money from his relatives and parents. I could get access to his Binance wallet but they always seem to stay approximately $0 after some trading back and forth. He also has a contact of this dude name Eric on Telegram which was probably given by this girl for trading stuff. All of these connections just really spin my head around.

2. She's been texting him on WhatsApp only and sometimes call. However, no video record found.
It's been 3 months and it looks like her texts really show lots of care and effort. She says she's from Melbourne and half Fillipino, doing drop shipping atm. She also sent him photos and they all match, however no selfie of her but generally photos like dressing up and coffee and bikini ones. I got her number and it’s actually Aus number, except for that it’s not from big provider like Vodafone or Optus, but a very insignificant brand i never heard of - Pivotel? She actually puts effort in texting everyday and even asked about his family, friends and jobs etc. She even invites him to go to Melbourne to meet her? This part confuses me because my friends say they would avoid seeing in person. However, he denies and just continues on texting or sometimes call.

I don’t know what to do at the moment as I am still lost cuz we have been together for more than 5 years. Been through ups and downs but regardless I still worry and care a lot for him. If this is scam, what should i do 😔

Okay, let’s be honest—**finding the perfect crossbody purse** feels a little like dating. You want something stylish, practical, dependable, and hopefully not too heavy on your shoulder (or your wallet). Enter the **Gladdon Crossbody Purse**.

I’ve been carrying this little gem for a while now, and spoiler alert: it checks way more boxes than I expected. If you’re curious about size, pockets, and how to actually style it without looking like you just raided your grandma’s closet, you’re in the right place.

Grab your coffee (or your mimosa, no judgment), and let’s dive in.

# Why the Gladdon Crossbody Purse is Worth Talking About

So, what’s the big deal with a purse that costs less than a fancy dinner out? Honestly, it’s the mix of **affordability + style + practicality** that caught my eye.

Unlike some crossbody bags that look cute but hold exactly one lip balm and a receipt, the Gladdon purse is surprisingly roomy. I’ve taken it out shopping, on casual dinner nights, and even used it as a travel bag when I didn’t want to lug around a tote.

And yes, it survived all of that without fraying or falling apart. Ever had a strap break in public? Yeah, not fun.

# Size: Small But Mighty

Let’s talk dimensions because size matters (at least when it comes to purses 😉).

The **Gladdon Crossbody Purse** usually measures around:

* **9.5 inches (L)**
* **3 inches (W)**
* **7 inches (H)**

That’s basically the sweet spot between *too tiny to be useful* and *so big it might as well be a backpack*.

So what fits inside? Here’s what I usually toss in mine:

* Phone (fits my iPhone Pro Max, which is saying something)
* Slim wallet
* Keys
* Small makeup pouch
* Hand sanitizer (because… life)
* Earbuds
* Random receipts I swear I’ll throw away later

**Pro tip:** You can even squeeze in a Kindle if you angle it right. Bookworms, rejoice!

# Pockets: Organized, Finally

If you’re anything like me, you’ve had that *“Where the heck are my keys?!”* moment while standing in the rain. The Gladdon bag saves you from that chaos.

It usually comes with:

* **Main compartment**: Spacious enough for all the basics.
* **Zipper pocket inside**: Great for valuables like cash or cards.
* **Slip pocket**: Perfect for chapstick or metro cards.
* **Back pocket (zipper)**: Easy access for things you need in a hurry.

Basically, it’s a mini command center. Everything has a place, and you don’t have to dig like a miner every time you need something.

# Material and Durability

The purse is made of **PU leather** (aka vegan leather). Now, I know some people hear “PU leather” and think cheap. But honestly? This one feels soft, durable, and doesn’t scream “fake.”

I’ve worn it in light rain, spilled a latte on it (don’t ask), and it wiped clean like nothing happened. **Durability test: passed.**

Is it going to last 10 years like a $500 designer bag? Probably not. But for everyday use, this thing is solid.

# Best Outfits to Rock with the Gladdon Crossbody Purse

Here’s where it gets fun—styling. Because let’s face it, a bag can be practical all day long, but if it doesn’t look cute with your outfit, what’s the point?

# Casual Day Outfits

* Skinny jeans, oversized sweater, white sneakers.
* Add the purse in **neutral beige or black**—it’ll tie the look together.

# Office Chic

* Blazer + ankle pants + loafers.
* The **structured shape** of the Gladdon bag adds polish without trying too hard.

# Date Night

* Little black dress + heels.
* Go for the **red or burgundy purse** to add a pop of color.

# Travel Vibes

* Leggings + long cardigan + slip-ons.
* The crossbody design keeps your hands free for airport snacks.

Basically, it’s one of those rare purses that plays well with almost every style.

One thing I love about the **Gladdon Crossbody Purse** is that it comes in multiple colors. Whether you’re a classic **black and beige gal** or love a little **pop of red, mustard, or green**, there’s an option.

Personally, I grabbed mine in **neutral beige**, and it goes with everything. But I’ve been eyeing the mustard one too—because apparently, I can’t resist “just one more purse.” Relatable, right?

# Pros and Cons

Let’s be real. No purse is perfect. Here’s my breakdown after months of use:

**Pros**

* Compact yet spacious
* Multiple pockets for organization
* Affordable price point
* Stylish enough for work or play
* Easy to clean PU leather

**Cons**

* PU leather won’t last forever
* Strap can feel a bit stiff at first
* Not big enough for laptops (duh, but still)

# How It Compares to Other Crossbody Bags

I’ve tried everything from cheap fast-fashion purses to pricier leather crossbodies, and the Gladdon holds its own surprisingly well.

Compared to **quilted crossbody bags**, it feels more versatile—those are cute but not always office-appropriate. Against **travel crossbody bags**, the Gladdon wins in style but loses a bit in capacity.

So, if you want something that balances **style + function + price**, this is a solid pick.

# Who Should Buy It?

If you’re:

* Someone who wants a **stylish everyday crossbody bag**
* A traveler who needs hands-free convenience
* A college student looking for affordable but chic accessories
* Or literally anyone who loses stuff in giant tote bags (🙋‍♀️)

Then yes, this purse is totally worth it.

# Final Thoughts

The **Gladdon Crossbody Purse** might not be designer, but it nails the essentials: **practical size, useful pockets, stylish looks, and affordable pricing**.

It’s the kind of bag you reach for without thinking because you know it’ll work with whatever you’re wearing. And IMO, that’s the ultimate sign of a great purse.

So whether you’re headed to brunch, running errands, or boarding a flight, this little bag has your back. Or your shoulder, technically.

# FAQs About Crossbody Bags

**Is PU leather durable for daily use?**  
Yes, PU leather is durable for everyday use. While it won’t last decades like genuine leather, it’s easy to maintain, lightweight, and cruelty-free.

**What fits in a small crossbody bag?**  
A small crossbody bag like the Gladdon usually fits essentials: phone, wallet, keys, makeup, and sanitizer. Some models even fit an e-reader.

**How to adjust a chain strap for better fit?**  
If the chain strap is too long, you can loop it inside the bag or use a clip to shorten it. Quick, easy, and doesn’t ruin the look.",1,1758942383.0,TheBeautyCircle,0,1.0,False

1nrkhu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1nrkhu3/parents_of_timid_toddlers/,Parents of timid toddlers…,"My firstborn is three years old now (and, according to the doctor, not on the spectrum). My husband and I had always pictured a rambunctious little boy getting into mischief, but instead we’re noticing more and more how timid he is.

He loves watching other kids his age ride bikes or scooters, shoot down long slides, swim, skate, go on carnival rides (the ones for toddlers), and climb on playground equipment. But when we ask him to try, the answer is always “too big,” “too fast,” or just a nervous shake of the head. He has tried some of these things before and we know he’s capable, but if he doesn’t progress quickly, he refuses to do it again.

For example, he’s had a balance bike for over a year and won’t ride it out of the garage. A few months ago he could skate while holding just one of our hands, but the more we take him to the rink, the more fearful he becomes. Now he wants us to pick him up on ice the whole time, even though he’s the one who asks to go. Climbing a small wall or even hanging on monkey bars is a complete nonstarter.

This kind of caution shows up in everyday life too. He’ll stop at the curb long before any car or pedestrian is near, won’t let me step off the curb unless we use the ramp, and refuses to eat anything warm without blowing on it for ages. He blocks his one-year-old brother from doing things he thinks might be dangerous, often long before we would step in.

We’ve rarely told him “you can’t” because of age, size, or danger (unless it’s something truly unsafe, like the stove). Since before he could walk, we’ve encouraged him to help with chores. He loves making coffee, doing laundry, and vacuuming, for instance. At the playground, we’re the parents always saying “you can do it” or “just try it out.”

I know every child is different, but we worry about him growing up so cautious that he misses out on experiences and joy. We honestly don’t know what we’re doing wrong.

Parents of timid toddlers, what helped in your case? Did your kids grow out of it, and how much did they change as they got older?",6,1758942159.0,toddlers,6,1.0,False

This is my first try with 20 minute and 90 minute hot mud. I think I like it a little better than the premix stuff, just been reluctant to try it. Had some bigger gaps and read it was what I should use. 

I probably did this wrong, but:

*I filled the real big gaps with window and door expanding foam (tried backer rod but didn't work as well). Cut a valley into the foam after it cured.

*Cut up a bunch of fiberglass mesh tape into 1-3 inch strips and mixed them into a generous mess of 20 min mud and slapped into the foam valleys pressing it in as I went. Figured the overlapping random pattern would add strength to my mess?

*Next layer is paper tape and 20 min mud

\* 5 oz Blue Curacao

\* 5 oz fresh squeezed lime juice

\* 2 oz agave

\* Pinch of salt

Shaken over ice then poured.

The end result is very smooth. It still tastes like a margarita, but less acidic and less of a bite. 

I was inspired by some of the cocktails I've had at Handshake Speakeasy in Mexico City and more recently Blythe and Burrows in Portland Maine. At B&B, My partner and I had a great bartender who explained the clarification process and sparked an interest in making our own.

When rain falls in places that are drier than bone, strange things feel the moisture on their faces and crawl toward the surface, upwards and upwards until they can smell the creosote, and when their heads break through the soft, wet earth, they come to know creation instead of decay. They come to know breathing instead of stillness. 

They come to know us.

***Prologue***

Monsoon season was not for the weak, as I continued to remind myself year after year. I had already done the usual things, nailing down my shutters, ensuring the three deadbolts on my front door were in working order, and securing the canvas cover over my truck. Its windshield was sporting several pock marks and scratches from last year’s storms. The cover was a good investment, and I wasn’t taking any chances. Once all of my bases were covered, I felt satisfied enough to settle in for the night. With a book in one hand and a cup of black coffee warming my other, I resigned myself to the living room where I sunk into my old armchair, the only piece of furniture in the room that I actually felt comfortable sitting on. It had molded perfectly to the shape of my spine over the years, and it felt wrong to stray from the gentle cradle of its worn leather. 

Before I picked up my book in earnest, I glanced at the clock hanging on the wall across from me. The picture decorating its face was faded, a faceless cowboy in full gear was tossing a lasso over his head in a wide arc. Before him stood a horse with wide eyes, crouched over in a way that horses aren’t prone to crouching, up on its toes like it was trying to jump, but couldn’t quite lift itself off the ground. It watched the cowboy’s arm, and seemed to know its capture was inevitable. Where would the false cowboy take it? To tame? To slaughter? I could never quite figure it out. 

Its hands read 11:26 PM. It was then that I heard the boom of thunder outside, and soon came the transition of raindrops from nonexistent, to gentle, to all out warfare against my roof. The book I had chosen was an old read, a familiar story about a sheriff and all his guilt. It boasted a leather bound cover embossed with gold letters, and yellowed pages within, many of them dog-eared. My eyes had barely scanned the introductory page when I heard the first knock.

It was soft and inquisitive, like a child tapping on their parents’ bedroom door in the dead of night. I looked back at the clock. 12:12 AM. Right on schedule. I turned off the lamp, I closed my book, set it down on the side table, and slid open one of its drawers. The gun inside was an antique, or so I’d been told, and it was beautiful. Despite the low light, the handle glimmered in my grasp. I checked the cylinder, and it was full. I set the gun back in the drawer and waited for what I knew was coming. Briefly, I wondered whose voices they’d use this time.

The second round of knocks came down harder. 

“If you spend your whole life messing around, you’ll have a hell of a lot to clean up when you’re ready to die.” The first voice, gruff and male, barked at me, drawing my eyes towards my bolted front door. 

The second voice, female this time, did nothing but let out a shivering sob, and I ripped my eyes away from the door immediately, my lungs quivering as I let out a sigh. Out of all the voices, this had always been the one that brought me the closest to opening the door and letting in… whatever was on the other side. They were good, I’d give them that.

I’d taken to gently tapping patterns against the cover of the book when the assault on the windows began. They must have been angry that my previous weaknesses could no longer be exploited, and they took out their rage on the shutters on the outside of the windows. It was a cacophony, what sounded like hundreds of fists banging against the wood, hundreds of nails clawing, hundreds of voices howling and hundreds of palms slapping against the sides of my house. 

*They can’t force their way inside.* I reminded myself. *They can only force you to give up.* That knowledge had comforted me on many a night like this, rainy and dark and full of voices I hadn’t heard in years. *They want your fear, to feast on it and let it make them strong.* They were just pack animals, like coyotes surrounding a rabbit’s burrow. Both wanted flesh, I guessed both needed it to sustain themselves in different ways. I gripped the arm of the chair in an attempt to steady the rapidly increasing beat of my heart.

“One clean shot,” A new voice made my head snap up. It came from the kitchen window. My mind fought furiously as my body disobeyed every instinct and bit of sense I had, climbing up from the chair and creeping across the floor until I was positioned in front of the window. I faced the drawn curtains. “The clouds above me,” the voice was saying, low and calm just as the speaker had always been. “That’s what you’d like to think”. My heart dropped. There was no mistaking it; it was undoubtedly Jojo. I could do nothing but steady myself against the kitchen sink and wonder when it might have happened.

The night and all its illusions raged on, transforming my house from a home into a fallout shelter. I returned to my place in the armchair and tried to keep my head down. I needed something to focus on that wasn’t the dust-covered, mindlessly ticking clock, so I once again picked up my book and flipped to the first page. Between it and the soft leather of the cover, a torn scrap of paper was nestled, covered in scribbly handwriting. I didn’t read Jojo’s note very often. I was used to nights like these, and I knew I could get through them if I focused hard enough. However, something about this particular night prompted me to allow my eyes to travel down the paper.

“Persevere, and give yourself grace.” I read the writing out loud, then again and again.

“Persevere, and give yourself grace. Persevere, and give yourself grace.” I repeated it like a child might do with the Lord’s Prayer when the fear of monsters lurking under beds and inside closets creeps in. I could feel a change in the air, like electricity was running through the walls and straight into my body. The adrenaline and exhaustion must have caught up with me all at once. One moment I was reading, and then next my eyes were sliding shut, and my mind dissolved into the empty void of sleep. Instead of the peace and serenity brought on by dreamless darkness, memories bloomed like weeds behind my eyes and I was suddenly strangled by them.

1nrkak5,https://v.redd.it/9yxsbc95gmrf1,Baarbara review from Tulum Coffee,"Picked up my second bag of Tulum’s Baarbara recently. It’s a medium-dark single-estate roast with nutty/chocolate notes and a touch of grape/orange.
Espresso: smooth hazelnut + cocoa, mild acidity, easy daily drinker, forgiving shot.
French press: fuller body, rounder caramel/nut profile, fruit takes a back seat.
Pros: versatile, approachable, works black or with milk.
Cons: not for those chasing bright, high-acid profiles; a few folks report inconsistent batches.

Overall: 8/10 — solid everyday coffee that shines in both espresso and French press. I did not love the aftertaste.

Hard part was, she revealed that she had 2 relationships back then and slept with both of them. She told me that she needed to tell me this as she was feeling guilty about it. I knew one of the relationship back then but she just told me they just went out to go eat and talk and there was nothing going on, and I trusted her for that. There was even a time when I visited her at the state where she was working and she told me that the time that she said she was gonna go work late while I was there was actually to meet with a colleague of hers at his house. I never expected all of that to happen because I trusted that she wouldn’t ever do that. Even when I questioned her back then she kept saying she didn’t do anything. Coming back to meeting her recently, after she told me all of that, I wasn’t really able to think much but I’d just say I forgive her then and there. From then on, we contacted only a few times to ask on our families and give well wishes, but aside from that, we haven’t spoken anymore.

We’ve never met in person; it’s always been an online friendship.

I told him no because my boyfriend wouldn’t be comfortable with that, and Jake said he totally understood and respected my boyfriend’s position.

Today he showed up in my city again and wanted to meet me for coffee, even though I told him no and explained it wouldn’t be appropriate without our mutual friend Mia there. He ended up basically showing up at the mall where I was after I mentioned it casually, and tried to pressure me into meeting him. He said he couldn’t believe I’d “leave him hanging” after he came all this way and that “my bf doesn’t need to know we saw each other because we’re not doing anything wrong” which was very sus of him to say.

I’m really confused because he always claimed to respect me and my relationship, but then does stuff like this. So, AITA for refusing to meet him even though he says he’s lonely and traveled here? He hasn’t spoken to me since I left him alone at the mall, it’s been hours and now I guess the friendship is ruined. ",3,1758941409.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1nrk3t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DateEverything/comments/1nrk3t5/fanx_date_everything_panel_answers/,FanX Date Everything Panel Answers!,"I attended the Date Everything panel at FanX, which featured the voice actors for Lyric/Scandalabra/Wallace (Ray Chase), The Hanks/Johnny Splash (Robbie Daymond), Jean Loo/Mikey Transaction (Max Mittelman), Lucinda Lavish (Sarah Natochenny), Mitchell Linn (J. Michael Tatum), and Dunk Shuttlecock (Alejandro Saab)

I thought I’d share some of the answers they gave during the Q&A! This is mostly from memory so don’t quote me on anything.

“What DND Class would your characters be?”
Jean Loo would not be a bard (too predictable) but rather a necromancer or warlock or something.
Ray: Wallace would be a barbarian and Lyric would be the DM because he likes writing his own stories!
J. Michael: Mitchell Linn wouldn’t have a class, he would just own a tavern. “Mitchell certified npc!”
Alejandro: Dunk would be a monk, and show up to the first session with a paper that just says “Dunk the Monk” on it and nothing else.

“Which character would you want to realize?”
Ray: Dishy, because he canonically makes the world better and more efficient
Robbie: “Sofia the Safe for my own personal reasons”
Sarah: Lux, Lucinda or Jean Loo
Alejandro: Maggie
Max: Vaugn Trapp (Ray claims Trapp is canonically the best lover)

“Favorite voiceline, either from your character or someone else?”
Ray: Tony mispronouncing “Date Everything” in the intro, and Mitchell Linn saying “You are rude, crude and have a poor attitude, and frankly you smell of low quality beef”
Bobbie: Vaughn Trapp saying “I can’t wait to love you or whatever the fuck!”
Max: Mikey Transaction doing an extended offscreen monologue in various voices
Alejandro: “Oh, sex! Yeah, you meant sex!”

“If you could turn any object in your house into a dateable what would it be?”
J. Michael: Has a cool coffee table made out of airplane parts that he “wished he could date even before Date Everything”
Robbie: The safe, again

“If you could add another dateable to the game what would it be?”
They discussed the concept of having a second bed or coffee maker so there could be a rivalry.

Bonus answers:
-J. Michael Tatum also got to contribute to the soundtrack, they needed a concierto for Keyes and he “just happened to have one written already”
-Ray Chase said they made a huge effort to get a diverse group of voice actors, even making sure that Mac’s voice actor was a wheelchair user irl
-Vaughn Trapp’s voice actor apparently “improvised 50% of his lines” and they had a lot of trouble picking which ones they would keep because they were all gold
-Sarah “Loves when girls are fans of Lucinda” 
-Alejandro is told often that he gives off the vibes of a supportive jock even though he isn’t actually into sports

1nrk238,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_slenderman_goose/comments/1nrk238/dirt_pt_6/,Dirt - Pt 6,"   A lifetime later, I awoke to see a jackrabbit crouched on my chest. It was strangely light for something so large, as though its insides had been hollowed out and all that remained on top of me was grey-brown fur and those amber eyes that, despite the absence of visible white, looked all too human. It was gone in the time between a blink and a deep breath; another visiting omen. This time, I knew I had to listen, because this was evolution at its core. This was nature saying “adapt, lest your body be turned into a beacon to ward away the pestilence of ants and birds of prey”. The rabbit’s eyes had been so bright, that for a moment, they had fooled my own into believing that it might be daytime, but when I finally blinked and turned them toward the clock, its hands only read 2:22 AM. An entire ocean of memories had passed in a little over two hours, and now, years after my journey to the desert, my body felt every moment of it, as if I’d physically lived it all over again.

My head throbbed, demanding something to take the edge off, so I got unsteadily to my feet and headed once more into the kitchen. As I poured myself a fresh mug of coffee and stirred in a few splashes of whiskey, I took note of the voices outside. They had quieted down to nothing but a faint murmure, as if they were discussing something they didn’t want to share with me. Their hesitance unnerved me. These were not cautious creatures, and I almost wished that Jojo’s would come back and talk to me again, like he did earlier. I spoke out loud then. I knew my voice was not a weapon that they wished to claim for their arsenal, and even if it was, they could have it. I was no longer afraid of whatever forms they would twist it into. 

“Hey Jojo,” I called out. “I’m sorry I didn’t call. I don’t really hold anything against you, and I hope that when your time ran out, it was peaceful.” Acknowledging that Jojo was dead lifted something from my spirit. I always knew he didn’t belong in this world. He was too mysterious, he felt too much, and there was always just a bit too much laughter in those obsidian eyes. There was nothing for him here, so I hoped that wherever he was, he was spouting poetry and laughing maniacally and swaying back and forth to the song of the windchimes. I hoped he didn’t have to run anymore. I heard a faint tap on the kitchen window, and my body tensed, but whatever was out there made no more attempts at entry. Even the others fell completely silent. I was alone at the center of the universe and yet, I felt less lonely than ever before. The clouds above me were lifting, but somewhere along the edge of my sight, I saw lightning flash, and fear came flooding back. The rain came flooding back, too. Biblical levels of it slammed against my roof, shaking the house to its very foundations and reigniting the agony that burned behind my eyes. I think I might have yelled something, maybe a cry for my mother to come rescue me, or a plea for God to stop the storm. I was sure it would eat away at the house, the final line separating me from my world and the empty, dark world of the midnight monsoon, and carrying me away like Noah in the arc. Only except for bright and beautiful animals to surround me, I would only be left with bones and skin and bloody fur. 

I tried to keep myself calm, but the hesitance of the voices was sending continuous chills up and down my spine until I felt like a beast with its hackles raised. I could smell the rain as it soaked through the ceiling. I could smell a fight. Slowly, methodically, I went into the living room and retrieved my gun from where I’d left it on the floor when I fell asleep. My fingers extended, barely brushing the grip.

“Drop it.” Sadie’s voice was back, harsher this time and snapping at me from the space behind my eyes. I whirled around, expecting to see the front door banging open in the wind and one of my tormentors glowering before me, but my house was secure. Nothing had slipped through the cracks. Inhaling shakily, I replied. “What’s going on?”

At that, the voices outside seemingly found a renewed sense of gusto, and for the first time ever, they spoke to me in my own voice. 

“The last night,” they chanted gleefully. “The final storm.”

“The last night? Am I going to die?”

“Drown,” I giggled back from the other side of the wall, voice multiplied a thousand times. “Let the roof cave in and try to escape.”

I grit my teeth so hard I thought I could feel them crack. “What do you want? My fear, right? Or is it my soul?” 

They laughed at me, and at that moment, I was blindly, brilliantly angry; not at the beasts of the night who had tormented me relentlessly every summer, not at Jojo for leaving me out here with no idea what was to come, but at myself, for having been cowardly enough to run away from all the good things I had, and stupid enough to find myself here. I had been presented with a million outs; a million outcomes, and I had stayed with the blazing sun and the lifeless earth and the gleeful things outside and my own self pity. This was never my home, and it never should have been, and at that moment, I knew that there was only one outcome moving forward. 

The metal of the deadbolts was ice cold against my skin as I slid and pulled them. Chains rattled, and wood creaked. I felt like a contortionist unraveling my body from itself; my heavy body made of rubber that twisted and created uncomfortable and unnatural shapes. With hands that trembled like leaves and lungs that seemed to have forgotten how to breathe, my fingers rested on the doorknob. The voices screamed in an uproar of laughter. What was I thinking? I was going to let them in. What would they do to me when they got here? 

 “Don’t run.” Once again, her voice sounded so close that she could have been speaking in my ear. This time, I didn’t flinch or turn around. *No more running.* Instead, I twisted the knob and let the door swing open into that dark, hungry night.

When I was a kid, maybe eight or nine years old, my uncle Jack took me on a Swordfishing trip off the coast of southern California. For a little boy who had spent his entire life in a landlocked state, it was practically a dream come true. The day we were supposed to set out on the boat, the sky was open and it was pouring rain, a direct contradiction to the sunny, boat-friendly weather the newspaper had promised us. I remember standing on the dock, shivering as uncle Jack got the boat ready. I was confused, why would we bother going fishing when it was raining this hard? I was scared that the boat would capsize, and that we would be at the mercy of an Ocean I knew nothing about, but uncle Jack insisted that we would be alright. The boat would be just fine, and we would be too. Besides, we would be like real pirates, sailing into a storm. I conceded a bit at that. I wanted to be a pirate.

Despite my uncle’s best intentions, we didn’t make it more than three hundred yards from the dock when something went wrong. I stood on a crate or a brick or something, craning my upper body out over the railing because I swore I saw something under the water’s surface. I thought it was a swordfish, and that it was probably the biggest in the sea. I was trying to point it out to uncle Jack, but the crate or brick was a little too high, I was a little too far over the rail, and he was a little too far away to snatch the back of my shirt before I plummeted over the side. Thank god, I knew how to swim and I was good at it, so I couldn’t have been beneath the surface for more than seven seconds, but it felt like years. My body hit the surface like an ice cube smashing into concrete, flying a million different directions. My limbs were tangled, my sinuses were on fire from an inhale full of water I didn’t know I’d taken. I tried to open my eyes, but the cold paralyzed them and glued them shut. The cold was the worst part. It was the kind of cold that could kill sailors, strangely cold for southern California in May, and within those seven seconds of paralysis, it fully convinced me that I would never feel warmth again.

Of course, when I was brought back aboard and given blankets and coffee for the first time in my life, I warmed up pretty quickly. Now, with the rain slamming down on me, five hundred miles away from any ocean, I wasn’t so sure. I immediately squeezed my eyes shut against the burning cold of the drops, but it was no use. They still stung through the skin of my eyelids. Despite the pain, I refused to look out into the darkness and whatever may inhabit it. I was expecting hands, hundreds of them, grabbing for my body and tearing at my skin, dragging me off to become one of them, but what I felt instead was humid, warm air wrapping my body in a cocoon that starkly contrasted the strange chill present throughout my house.

I raised my arms horizontally to balance my quivering body, and stepped onto the porch. The door behind me slammed shut with such force, it sent me staggering forward and I crashed down the steps, my palms meeting the sodden earth with a stinging smack. Fear clawed its way up from my stomach and into my throat, and I clamped my lips against the rising bile. Somewhere very close to my right, a woman screamed. My body shuddered, ears nearly exploding not only from the proximity and volume of the scream, but from the pure rage it exuded. It made me want to curl into a ball and beg for mercy, but I kept my head low, jaw locked, and eyes closed as I began to crawl through the mud, away from the house. All around me I heard footsteps and the whooshing of air that accompanies someone’s limbs moving extremely fast. Each and every time, I braced for some kind of terrible impact, but each and every time, they stopped just before they made contact with my body. Eventually, I stopped flinching, even when I shuffled headfirst into a thorny patch of brush, and when a man’s voice bellowed and gurgled in my ear and I could feel his breath on my neck.

Eventually, the crown of my head brushed something impenetrable and I lifted a mud caked palm to feel the surface. It was a rock, probably one of the big ones that lay around the yard. I shifted so that my back was pressed against it, and pulled my knees to my chest, lying on my side in the mud. A terrible scratchy scrabbling sound began then, like a million lizards scuttling up the rock. I knew they wouldn’t touch me, but their proximity, and the ferocity of their movements paralyzed me. This was the jackrabbit and the coyote pack; my final test. *Persevere, and give yourself grace.* I could be scared, but I had to keep going. ""Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me."" The words left me before I could give them a second thought. Who was God to me? Where had he been all this time? I knew he wasn’t there, nor did he care about what befell me, and I was certainly owed no forgiveness, but I said the words anyway, the same words my mother had spoken with her final breaths, alone in her hospital bed without me beside her.

“I will fear no evil.” I murmured. The moment I finally opened my eyes, the rain seemed to stall, as if an invisible umbrella had opened above my head. For that split second of clarity, I was floored at what I saw; at the sheer lack of everything. I was in a void. It was not darkness, but sheer absence of light. It was not silence, but the sheer absence of sound. It was the space before birth and after death. Then, I blinked, and the rain slammed into me, driving my weakened form farther into the clutches of the earth. Several hundred yards away, my house stood, windows glowing warmly through the downpour. The rain was warm, and the night was quiet, apart from the drops hitting the ground and the far off chirping of crickets, whose song I hadn’t realized I loved before now. Shakily, I got to my feet, trying in vain to wipe some of the mud from my hands, but it was pointless. I took one shuffling step forward after another until I was close enough to the house to make out the outline of my coffee mugs sitting on the kitchen windowsill. Then, lightning came down, blasting the ground in front of me wide open with its jagged, sparking body. I tripped and stumbled, and before I could catch myself, I careened into the blackness. My first thought was that this fissure would undoubtedly lead straight down to hell. My second was how glad I was that Sadie would get to live and die without ever seeing my face again.

1nrk0n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_slenderman_goose/comments/1nrk0n9/dirt_pt_4/,Dirt - Pt 4,"The morning dawned gray and lifeless, like an orange juiced and left in the dark to rot. The first thing I did when I worked up the courage to leave the closet was stumble into the bathroom and vomit. The poison that rose with the rain seemed to be leeching its way through the walls and floors a little more each night, flooding around me and turning the inside of my body to acid. Breakfast was not an option, so I sat in the armchair and mindlessly pulled Jojo’s note from its place in the side table. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for anymore, maybe a hidden message written in invisible ink, assuring me that all of this would be over soon, that there was something in the water and that I’d snap out of it? My eyes crossed and uncrossed, focused and unfocused as the white of the paper and the blue of the lines blurred together. My hands shook, rattling the page. Suddenly, a soft sound made my head jerk up, like weight shifting from foot to foot right outside my front door. In that instant, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the horrors had persisted through the night; that the sun had failed to burn them away, and now they were coming for me in daylight.

	I was reaching for something, and then my right hand once again formed a rock solid grip around Pearlino. There was a vague aching sensation in my knees as I became airborne, flying to the door and hurling it open. There was no pause, no aiming, and no moment of confirmation to see what lay on the other side. The gun fired, sending a twinge of pain up my trigger finger, and my entire body went rigid as a stone. It was only when I looked down and saw the mangled body of the Jackrabbit, lying in a pool of blood on my porch, that I felt like I could breathe again. It was impressively large, even without its head and it might once have been beautiful before all of the blood; before it trespassed. I watched in a sort of numb satisfaction as the greyish brown fur of its chest and side darkened into crimson and became overtaken by the molasses-like ooze. As I stepped back into the house, I tried not to think too hard about the little rabbit teeth and little rabbit bone fragments plastered across my porch, slowly sinking into the wood and making it rot. As I went, my vision sharpened for a moment. The front door; the door that had withstood all the barrages of scratching and pounding and terror was utterly pristine. Not a mark was present on its face, no signs of damage or assault.

	I should have recognized that rabbit as the omen that it was. After all, the desert was Earth’s greatest teacher. It taught its inhabitants how to adapt, and that if they failed to do so they would die and be baked in the sun along with the cracked and barren earth. The desert was trying to teach me a lesson, to warn me that the next time I opened my door for it, I perhaps would not be so lucky, and what was on the other side would perhaps not be so easy to kill. Who was I to shoot that rabbit anyway? As I sat in my armchair I couldn’t help but wonder if it had babies waiting back in its burrow. What would they think about their parent taking off, never to return? Who even knew if rabbits had thoughts like that. I tried to pull my mind in a different direction. I’d heard the phone ringing the night before, but there was only one person who ever called me, and the last thing on earth that I wanted at that moment was to hear his voice. 

The phone eyed me like a priest all day long, and I wanted nothing more than to avoid the confessional. I tried to distract myself by getting things together; making coffee, cleaning the kitchen, and trying to press every wrinkle from my blankets as I made my bed that had been rumpled for who knew how long, but at the end of it all, it still hung, guilting and unsympathetic to my excuses. I was afraid to pick it up; to hear the voice of someone I couldn’t see. Right alongside the fear came shame. I was a grown man, terrified of picking up the phone, and that knowledge finally pushed me hard enough to lurch into the hallway and lift it to my ear, pressing the button for messages.

*You have…* **one…** *new message.* Droned the phone. My chest tightened, and I steeled myself for what I knew was coming. 

“Hey Bailey, it’s me. It’s about… 2:30 AM and I was just calling to check in on you, and see how it’s going over there. I can imagine that talking to me isn’t quite at the top of your list of things to do right now, but if there’s trouble, you can always call. That said, if you won’t let me be an ear, then I need you to know that there’s not much I can do for you out there. It’s up to you now. I hope the sun rises on you soon enough.” Each one of Jojo’s sentences was punctuated by deep, scratchy inhalations, and occasional coughs that were loud enough to make the phone vibrate in my white-knuckled grasp. Without thinking, my hands found purchase on the plastic base of the phone and with a quick wrench, it separated from its place on the wall and clattered onto the ground at my feet, bits of drywall raining down across my feet, cord coiled in a heap like a freshly decapitated rattlesnake. I didn’t need Jojo’s help. I didn’t want to hear his voice, so calm and condescending and full of poetry I didn’t understand. He knew nothing about me.

For days thereafter, I sat inside waiting. For the rain, for something to speak to me, for Jojo to call, even though I knew I wouldn’t hear it. I wouldn’t even pick up even if I could. A monsoon seemed impossible, as the sun was blinding through the open shutters and the sky outside was a bright, merciful blue. Eventually though, it darkened, as I knew it would, and I was back to phase one, gripping my gun and cowering under my covers in bed like a frightened child. The voices seemed subdued somehow. Night after night, they gently tapped on the door and tried the shutters almost politely, as if they were apologizing for their previous misconduct. Night after night, I repeated, *persevere and give yourself grace,* and eventually, I came to realize the truth I’d been trying to avoid from the beginning. Whatever was knocking on my door wasn't human. None of them were. 

  
  


One afternoon, I stood at the kitchen sink washing the dishes. I hadn’t been eating much, and the plate and fork I’d used didn’t need to be scrubbed, rinsed, and dried seven times, but there I was doing it anyway. My vision was blurry, the clouds forming gray patches of shadow on the ground outside the window. A faint wind shook the brush. I realized I’d been staring so long that my eyes burned, stinging worse each time I let my eyes fall in a slow, languid blink. I allowed them to shut one more time, almost in slow motion, and when they opened, the sky outside the window was pitch black and I could hear the faint sound of rain tapping on the roof. 

I allowed myself three deep breaths before the panic set in, and I sprang over to the front door. Just as I slid the deadbolt closed, a violent force on the other side slammed into the wood, rattling the chain and wiggling the handle, and sending me stumbling backwards. 

	“You’re no adventurer, and you’re certainly no fool,” My uncle was back, speaking more lines from our final conversation. “Don’t be stupid about this.” 

	In response, I raced to the kitchen window and yanked the curtains closed, but just before the fabric came together and blotted out the darkness, my eyes lifted from the floor and gazed through the glass. I don’t know what I was hoping to see, but my breath caught in my chest. Nothing stared back at me. 

	“Bailey,” my uncle barked, landing three sharp smacks on the door. “Think about your mother. Are you trying to kill her faster?” My blood chilled when I realized those weren’t my uncle’s words; whatever had stolen his voice was speaking on its own now, and it sounded angry.

I stood trembling, wishing he would give up on me, but at the mention of my mother, something shifted inside me. Even though I knew it was probably suicide, I spoke back to the voice.

	“I didn’t kill her.”

	“No? You certainly didn’t help her survive, either.” 

	“What?” I managed.

	“You’d like to believe you had nothing to do with her death, but we both know that’s a load of bullshit.”

	“I didn’t kill her!” I shouted, lurching forward and banging my own fist against the door.

	“Don’t believe me? Fine. She can tell you herself.”

	I didn’t know what that meant, not until something outside on the porch shifted and a gentle tapping sounded on the door. By the time I understood the situation fully, the only thought I could form was, *I’m not ready.* 

	“Bailey, honey? Come on, no more of this now.” It was definitely my mother, or at least it sounded just like her, before sickness stole the gentleness from her voice and the meat from her bones; before I’d stopped visiting. Everything about the voice was a perfect, flawless reincarnation, right down to the light emphasis she placed on the o’s in each word, which I always thought made her voice sound more like a cooing dove than a human. I recoiled from the door as if it had burnt my hand.

	“Uncle Jack is right, you know,” She said sadly. I tried frantically to remember when she may have said that to me, but I had no memory of the last time we spoke. All I knew is that I hadn’t said goodbye. “You killed me. You’re the one who did me in, no doubt about it.” The tears came all at once, flowing from my eyes in a blazing torrent. 

	“Mom?” My tone was begging. I needed it to be her, and for all her words to be lies. I needed it like oxygen.

	“I stopped being your mother when you left me to die.” The voice spat, suddenly hollow and wispy, like wind blowing through a canyon. 

I staggered backwards, and the backs of my knees found the couch. Collapsing sideways, I pulled my knees to my chest as my tears threatened to drown me. Each time I blinked, I was assaulted by images of nightmarish apparitions with my mother’s face; twisted bodies and disfigured limbs, hairless heads and bloodshot eyes and mouths full of bile, tubes and metal and sterile plastic. There was no group ambush tonight, only the voice of my mother begging me to let her inside, that she was cold and scared and wanted to see her boy, and that her head hurt. Each of her occasional gentle taps on the door wracked my body with the pain of a gunshot wound to the head. I wished for millions of them to tear my house apart stone by stone, to force their way inside and dismantle my body as well. At least then I would finally face retribution. At least I wouldn’t have ears to hear her anymore. I felt my eyes roll up in my head, my vision went dark, and I cried for my mother.

	I was sick of passing out. I wanted unconsciousness to come at will, not be forced by my own hand or come about as an unfortunate side effect of pure terror and distress. Nevertheless, I awoke on my bathroom floor the morning after my mother visited me, dizzy, groggy, and unsure of how I’d ended up there. I sat up, my head throbbing, and when I glanced down at the tile of the floor, I was greeted by streaks of blood. I must have fallen and hit my head. A quick press of my fingertips to my temple confirmed it, and I winced at the tenderness. After what felt like hours, I finally gathered the strength to haul myself to my feet and stumble into the hall, but I was quickly brought to my knees once again by the memories from the previous night. Fresh tears pricked my eyes and I was considering the possibility of just lying back on the bathroom floor and giving up completely. I allowed myself to sob pathetically, before eventually standing shakily once again and pouring myself a glass of water.

	In some ways, everything got easier from that point on. The desert saw a dry spell that lasted for a couple of weeks, which should have brought relief, but what it brought instead was a feeling of resignation; the knowledge that the rains would come again, and that when they did, the air would come alive with voices. *Nothing can be worse than mom.* That was my mantra, the thing I kept repeating to myself when the monotony of the days got to me and I started thinking too hard about what horrors the monsoons might dredge up from the earth. I’d survived the most heinous thing that could be thrown at me, I was sure of it. All I had to do now was keep myself sane. I set about making preparations, and despite the unforgiving heat of the sun, I spent hours outside, securing my shutters with extra nails and walking laps around the house in search of cracks, dents or points of weakness. Logically, I knew they couldn’t get in. Jojo had told me so, but doing this made me feel better, like I was doing something to fight back against my fate, whatever it may be.

Like everything else in the desert, the dry spell died. It was killed in the night by thick, angry stormclouds and it seemed that nothing could bring it back to life. Night after night they visited me, and each time I paid them less mind. I didn’t speak, didn’t knock back, didn’t even breathe louder than I dared. That made them angry all over again. Most nights, my mother was at the forefront of their assault, each word venomous and full of blame; nothing but a punishment, I knew, for not letting them inside, and yet it felt like a punishment for everything else. The pain was indescribable.  I don’t know exactly how long I stayed in this strange state of limbo, but every night they grew angrier and angrier, and every night I took triple my dose of Ambien, and dug myself deeper and deeper into disillusionment and numbness. 

I don’t remember a lot from this time period, and I probably caused some sort of damage to my brain. Most mornings I would awake to bouts of vomiting and intense headaches, and for a while I was all but bed bound, too weak to get to my feet or do anything else besides lie in bed and listen to the voices surrounding me. My body was glued to the bed, cemented in place by something between exhaustion and paralysis. I wasn’t afraid anymore, just so unbelievably tired. I had to force myself to do things that my body should have been doing on its own; blinking, breathing, and occasionally wiggling my fingers just to make sure they still worked. The voices also began to creep their way into the waking hours, whispering and murmuring just loud enough to make my eyes dance around the room in search of the source. 

I had a lot of dreams about what the entities tormenting me might look like. In every one I was chasing them through the desert, but each time, I was chasing something different. Once, it was a shadowy figure with glowing eyes that vanished when I finally caught up to it. Another time it was a ball of white light, and as I ran it blew bursts of cold wind into my face. When I tried to catch that one, it laughed at me, and the wind grew steadily louder and louder until I felt something deep inside my ears explode. There were many other variations, but somehow I knew that none of them waited for me outside the walls of the house. That thought, that overwhelming uncertainty of it all was what made me finally get to my feet and shamble forward. Despite the aching in my knees and the throbbing in my head, my mind was, for the first time in what felt like years, clear.

1nrjzpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/seogrowth/comments/1nrjzpe/some_differences_between_seo_and_aeogeoaivo/,Some differences between SEO and AEO/GEO/AIVO,"We have seen so many posts saying AEO/GEO is totally different from SEO and that SEO is all you need to do for AEO/GEO.

Semantic SEO is table stakes and likely the most important thing you can do but there are also differences - especially if you are thinking about appearing in ChatGPT.

We posted the following on our RivalSee blog  and copying here.

# 1. AIs Use Longer-Tail Keywords in Searches

Human search queries are often short, averaging 3-4 keywords. In contrast, when making web searches, AI models like ChatGPT search 5-10 highly specific, descriptive queries that can be 8-12 keywords long as part of a fan-out strategy.

 Instead of just focusing on smaller 3-4 keyword searches, content must also be optimized for these detailed long-tail 8-12 keywords and questions to be surfaced by AI.  This can be accomplished with entity/term optimization but going after the specific keywords that the AIs keep using can give an advantage.

# 2. Unlinked Brand Mentions Carry New Weight

For years, the do-follow backlink has been the primary goal of off-page SEO. In the AEO landscape, unlinked brand mentions on reputable sites, forums, and communities are powerful signals. Whereas brand mentions were not useful for standard search, LLMs ingests mentions to understand a brand’s authority and place in the market.

Mentions - even without links - matter. A robust digital PR and community engagement strategy is now a crucial component of discoverability.

# 3. Bottom-Funnel Content Is Credited More Often

Broad, top-of-funnel (ToFu) content used to be a great technique to generate site-clicks and brand awareness. For AI Chats, this ToFu content is now read and summarized by the LLMs without any attribution. Bottom-of-funnel (BoFu) content, which is evaluative in nature (e.g., “Top 10” lists, “Brand vs. Brand” comparisons), is far more likely to result in brand mentions and links.

 Prioritize creating unique, high-value MoFu and BoFu content, as AI is more inclined to mention your brand at this stage than for simple how to and top of funnel content.

# 4. Bing Optimization Is No Longer Optional

While Google dominates human search, recent studies have shown OpenAI now uses a combination of Bing and Google search as part of its realtime web-search results. OpenAI’s use of Bing will likely stay or even increase given Google’s Gemini is a direct competitor to ChatGpt. Many companies still neglect Bing, creating a significant opportunity for those who invest in the platform.

Actively optimize for Bing results using the Bing Site Webmaster and techniques that no longer work in Google like exact-match keywords and cross-linking.

# 5. Being in the Top 10 Matters, Not Just #1

Traditional SEO follows a power law where the #1 ranking captures the lion’s share of clicks. This model is flattening. AI engines typically ingest and synthesize information from the entire first page of results (often the top 8-10 links).

The strategic goal shifts from winner take all with the #1 spot to consistently appearing in the top 5-10 “consideration set” for a cluster of relevant topics.

# 6. Content Must Be Accessible Without JavaScript

Google’s crawlers are sophisticated at rendering JavaScript-dependent content, but many AI crawlers are not. They often only parse the raw HTML, completely missing any content that loads via client-side JS.

Ensure that all critical information, such as product details or testimonials, is server-side rendered or embedded directly in the HTML to guarantee it’s visible to AI.

# 7. Popular Brand Names Are Included in Search Keywords

AIs learn from association. When querying search engines, generative models often include well-known brand names to add context. For example, a search in GPT-5 for “best coffee in San Francisco” often resulted in web searches for “best coffee San Francisco Blue Bottle SiteGlass Philz.” - including the coffee shops Philz, Blue Bottle and SightGlass IN the search query!

Including relevant competitors, partners, and industry leaders in your content helps AI correctly categorize your brand and understand its position in the market.

# 8. AI Chat Personalizes Based on Your History

Features like ChatGPT’s “Memory” function are making AI-driven search deeply personal. An AI assistant will leverage a user’s history and preferences to conduct hyper-specific searches on their behalf

Generic, one-size-fits-all content will lose effectiveness. Creating detailed content that serves specific customer segments and niche use cases is essential for success.

And no, LLMs.txt do not matter yet.

Again, a great SEO strategy (E-E-A-T) is going to be more effective than just doing these.  But it is not a zero-sum game. You can optimize for both.

***Dirt***

	The day I came to close on the house, the desert smelled like flowers, not the typical hazy, mind-numbing scent that accompanied roses and the like, but something much sharper. It was like wild clay, dirt, and still pools of rainwater combined together and injected directly into my nose. I had been second guessing myself the entire drive, down every mile of cracked two-lane highway and every bump in the dirt road that branched off into the desert, and when I pulled up in front of the house, a modest, sunbaked thing with windchimes hanging from the front porch rafters, something in me wanted to turn the truck and all my belongings right around and speed back the way I’d come. However, when I saw the tall, dark haired man waiting for me outside and waving me forward, I knew it was too late to turn back. He introduced himself as Jojo, and insisted that he take me on a walking tour of the entire property before showing me the house. 

	“You native Mr. Bailey?” He asked me as we shuffled through the low sagebrush. 

	“No, sir. Grew up in Wyoming.”

	“You’re a long way from home, then.”

	“I am. Just trying to get away, I guess. Needed a change of scenery.” He nodded like he understood, and mercifully changed the subject. “You’re not afraid of the dark, are you?” He had clever eyes of an indeterminate color, somewhere between mud brown and raven black. He must have seen my discomfort, because he cracked a crooked smile. “It gets dark out here, darker than anywhere you’ve ever seen. No streetlights, no city lights, and no porch lights.” He said matter-of-factly. Jojo walked me all around the three acres of land surrounding the house, back and forth and back again, showing me where the well was, and the buried power lines. The inside of the house made me feel slightly less uneasy about my arrival. It was cozy and charming in a western sort of way, low to the ground and seemingly formed straight from the earth. Terracotta walls, tile floors,and an open design to promote airflow and reflect cool air; everything about it was intentional. 

“Do you get many bugs out here? Spiders, or scorpions?” I asked, examining a small crack in the wall behind the sofa. 

He shook his head. “Not anywhere near the house that I’ve seen. They won’t bother you if you don’t bother them.”

“And all this stuff, the furniture and decorations.. You don’t want any of it?”

He waved the question away like a stray gnat. “I’m moving in with family. Won’t need it.”

Jojo helped me bring in my few boxes and suitcases. I thanked him for his help, and in return I helped him pull the “sold” sign up from the dirt beside the front steps. 

	“There are a couple more things I want to go over with you before I leave you here.” He said. I didn’t like the phrasing of that sentence. When I said so, he laughed, a harsh sound like lightning striking the ground and responded with another question. “Do you know what a monsoon is?” 

	I did, or at least, I thought I did. “A summer storm.” Was my simple answer. Jojo nodded in concession.

	“A summer storm that will rip the shutters off your windows and carry your house away on a river of raindrops.”

	“They get that bad out here?” 

	“The soil is hard-packed. Think of it like dumping buckets of water into a basin with needle holes poked in the bottom. It will drain, but not quickly.”

	“Do I need to do anything specific to keep the house from flooding?”

	“There’s a pump in the hall closet just in case, but I haven’t had any trouble,” His eyes were suddenly deadly serious, no longer hosting the spark of wit they had before. “But when the sky is too dark to see the stars, you stay inside.”

	I walked Jojo to his car, but instead of crossing to the driver’s side, he swung open the passenger door and pulled out a small box. “Housewarming gift. You’ll like Pearlino. She’s an antique.” The wind whistled, lifting strands of his hair and tossing them across his face. With no further explanation, he got into the truck and pulled around towards the road. Within moments, he was gone in a cloud of dust.

	The gift I’d been given contained a small scrap of paper with what I assumed to be Jojo’s phone number written on the front. Not really knowing what to expect, I flipped over the note to the back side and was immediately caught off guard by the large, sharp handwriting. My eyes skimmed the words, and I was reading them but my brain wasn’t computing somehow. ***Persevere, and give yourself grace.***

My skin prickled and I shivered, though the air was decently warm. Already, the phrase had etched itself onto the inside of my eyelids, and every time I blinked, it glared at me. It sounded like part of a Bible verse or something, which was strange. I didn’t immediately take Jojo as the religious type. I also couldn’t place the verse it had come from. It sounded too generic, like an inspirational quote you’d find on the inside of a sympathy card. The other item in the box was a handgun, beautifully polished, handle inlaid with a pearly stone that gleamed white, purple, and turquoise in the fading light. This must have been Pearlino. I felt unworthy somehow. I should call Jojo up and tell him I couldn’t accept such a valuable gift, especially when I had no significant connection to him. Ultimately, I ended up stashing the gun and the note in a side table drawer and resigning my hesitation for another day. I’d talk to Jojo at some point to say thank you. For now, I had a lot to do, a lot to unpack, and a lot to keep my mind off of. 

	My first stretch in the house passed without incident, and without rain. My property was a mass of twisted, brownish grey corpses of what I figured had once been flowering bushes and green shrubbery. Many times, I wondered how someone could find any joy in a place like this, but then, I would remind myself that I hadn’t come here to find joy. As time ticked on, I tried to keep my mind from wandering, from falling victim to the monotony of the land around me. Jojo and I talked on the phone a couple of times throughout the months. He called and asked about me and the house, and once if I’d kept his windchimes up. He sounded noticeably happier when I said yes. 

	“Can I ask you a question?” I asked into the mouthpiece during one such call. It was shockingly cold outside, and despite the warmth of the house, my fingers felt frozen around the phone. 

	“You can.” Jojo answered, then coughed.

	“I feel like I’m going crazy out here. Everything looks the same. How’d you deal with that yourself?”

	There was quiet on the other line, until he finally replied, voice slightly raspier than before. “I didn’t. I just let things roll over me.”

	“Things? Like what things?”

	“Like… what I’ve done wrong, what I’ve done right, and what’s still left to be done.”

	I hadn’t been anticipating that kind of answer, and it wasn’t what I wanted to hear in the least. “And, if that’s not an option?”

	“That’s the thing about the desert,” Jojo said. “There are no options. You either survive it, or you don’t.”

	The land remained drier than dry, and windier than Hell’s second circle. I took to exploring it, observing things and cross referencing my discoveries with Jojo, whose phone calls had become a weekly and highly anticipated occurrence in my life. As winter turned to spring, I noticed the subtle changes that came along with the warming of the weather. All of the once dead branches and twigs seemed to glow with a kind of new life. The morning sun brought a relief to the aching in my bones that I’d hoped to outrun for another ten or so years. Rabbits scurried around in the underbrush and I could often hear bees buzzing on quiet mornings. I even tried Jojo’s idea of “letting things hit me”, and sat out on the front porch one morning, but immediately thoughts and memories formed a funnel cloud that threatened to blow me away if I sat with it any longer. I had to get up, brew a strong pot of coffee and smoke a cigarette to return my mind to the present. The desert seemed to be reincarnating all around me, but still no flowers bloomed, no green appeared. The brown desolation I was familiar with remained, and I knew what they needed; the one thing this place hadn’t seen in a long time. 

	“When does the rainy season start?” I stirred my coffee after yet another unsuccessful thinking session, gazing out my kitchen window at the first rays of early morning sun that were just beginning to peek inside.

	“Hard to say,” Jojo sounded rough, as if he’d been shouting for a long time and was now facing the consequences. He had to keep stopping to take deep, rattling breaths or heave out coughs that made me wince just from hearing them. “Could be any day now, could be weeks.”

	“Are you alright?” I asked. “You sound a bit worse than last week.”

	The silence was deafening, as it always was when Jojo was considering the best way to answer a question. That was something I liked about him; he always took time to think things through before speaking.

	“I am worse than last week,” he confirmed. “Green tea with honey does wonders, though.”

	“It feels like I’ve been sick since I got here,” I sympathized. “It’s nothing like back home. It’s like my head is full of shit and I can’t clear it out.”

	Jojo let out what might have been a laugh on a kinder, less painful day. “When the trees bloom, you’ll be in for a hell of a time. Stay safe out there.” Was all he said before the line beeped.

**By: slenderman\_goose**

When rain falls in places that are drier than bone, strange things feel the moisture on their faces and crawl toward the surface, upwards and upwards until they can smell the creosote, and when their heads break through the soft, wet earth, they come to know creation instead of decay. They come to know breathing instead of stillness. 

They come to know us.

***Prologue***

Monsoon season was not for the weak, as I continued to remind myself year after year. I had already done the usual things, nailing down my shutters, ensuring the three deadbolts on my front door were in working order, and securing the canvas cover over my truck. Its windshield was sporting several pock marks and scratches from last year’s storms. The cover was a good investment, and I wasn’t taking any chances. Once all of my bases were covered, I felt satisfied enough to settle in for the night. With a book in one hand and a cup of black coffee warming my other, I resigned myself to the living room where I sunk into my old armchair, the only piece of furniture in the room that I actually felt comfortable sitting on. It had molded perfectly to the shape of my spine over the years, and it felt wrong to stray from the gentle cradle of its worn leather. 

Before I picked up my book in earnest, I glanced at the clock hanging on the wall across from me. The picture decorating its face was faded, a faceless cowboy in full gear was tossing a lasso over his head in a wide arc. Before him stood a horse with wide eyes, crouched over in a way that horses aren’t prone to crouching, up on its toes like it was trying to jump, but couldn’t quite lift itself off the ground. It watched the cowboy’s arm, and seemed to know its capture was inevitable. Where would the false cowboy take it? To tame? To slaughter? I could never quite figure it out. 

Its hands read 11:26 PM. It was then that I heard the boom of thunder outside, and soon came the transition of raindrops from nonexistent, to gentle, to all out warfare against my roof. The book I had chosen was an old read, a familiar story about a sheriff and all his guilt. It boasted a leather bound cover embossed with gold letters, and yellowed pages within, many of them dog-eared. My eyes had barely scanned the introductory page when I heard the first knock.

It was soft and inquisitive, like a child tapping on their parents’ bedroom door in the dead of night. I looked back at the clock. 12:12 AM. Right on schedule. I turned off the lamp, I closed my book, set it down on the side table, and slid open one of its drawers. The gun inside was an antique, or so I’d been told, and it was beautiful. Despite the low light, the handle glimmered in my grasp. I checked the cylinder, and it was full. I set the gun back in the drawer and waited for what I knew was coming. Briefly, I wondered whose voices they’d use this time.

The second round of knocks came down harder. 

“If you spend your whole life messing around, you’ll have a hell of a lot to clean up when you’re ready to die.” The first voice, gruff and male, barked at me, drawing my eyes towards my bolted front door. 

The second voice, female this time, did nothing but let out a shivering sob, and I ripped my eyes away from the door immediately, my lungs quivering as I let out a sigh. Out of all the voices, this had always been the one that brought me the closest to opening the door and letting in… whatever was on the other side. They were good, I’d give them that.

I’d taken to gently tapping patterns against the cover of the book when the assault on the windows began. They must have been angry that my previous weaknesses could no longer be exploited, and they took out their rage on the shutters on the outside of the windows. It was a cacophony, what sounded like hundreds of fists banging against the wood, hundreds of nails clawing, hundreds of voices howling and hundreds of palms slapping against the sides of my house. 

*They can’t force their way inside.* I reminded myself. *They can only force you to give up.* That knowledge had comforted me on many a night like this, rainy and dark and full of voices I hadn’t heard in years. *They want your fear, to feast on it and let it make them strong.* They were just pack animals, like coyotes surrounding a rabbit’s burrow. Both wanted flesh, I guessed both needed it to sustain themselves in different ways. I gripped the arm of the chair in an attempt to steady the rapidly increasing beat of my heart.

“One clean shot,” A new voice made my head snap up. It came from the kitchen window. My mind fought furiously as my body disobeyed every instinct and bit of sense I had, climbing up from the chair and creeping across the floor until I was positioned in front of the window. I faced the drawn curtains. “The clouds above me,” the voice was saying, low and calm just as the speaker had always been. “That’s what you’d like to think”. My heart dropped. There was no mistaking it; it was undoubtedly Jojo. I could do nothing but steady myself against the kitchen sink and wonder when it might have happened.

The night and all its illusions raged on, transforming my house from a home into a fallout shelter. I returned to my place in the armchair and tried to keep my head down. I needed something to focus on that wasn’t the dust-covered, mindlessly ticking clock, so I once again picked up my book and flipped to the first page. Between it and the soft leather of the cover, a torn scrap of paper was nestled, covered in scribbly handwriting. I didn’t read Jojo’s note very often. I was used to nights like these, and I knew I could get through them if I focused hard enough. However, something about this particular night prompted me to allow my eyes to travel down the paper.

“Persevere, and give yourself grace.” I read the writing out loud, then again and again.

 “Persevere, and give yourself grace. Persevere, and give yourself grace.” I repeated it like a child might do with the Lord’s Prayer when the fear of monsters lurking under beds and inside closets creeps in. I could feel a change in the air, like electricity was running through the walls and straight into my body. The adrenaline and exhaustion must have caught up with me all at once. One moment I was reading, and then next my eyes were sliding shut, and my mind dissolved into the empty void of sleep. Instead of the peace and serenity brought on by dreamless darkness, memories bloomed like weeds behind my eyes and I was suddenly strangled by them.

He’s always been weirdly very good about food, to the point where I could leave pizza on the coffee table, leave the room, and he wouldn’t touch it. Anyway, my cat ran away before she died. My family happened to all be gone but me. We thought she was probably somewhere in the house because there were many hiding spots. So I put plates of canned tuna around the house trying to draw her out, including having fans blow the air around. Turns out she was with some neighbors (showed up on their porch and stayed with them until my other neighbor helped me ask around. We got her home in the end). Anyway, when I got her back and settled in, I presented the plates to my dog, who definitely wanted it the whole time. Once I told him he could eat it, he inhaled it. I was genuinely touched by his restraint. 

Third time was when my family was in a cabin in the woods in an area that gets black bears. They’re really not a threat to anything but garbage as long as you leave them be. This one was trying to see if we had any good trash for him (we didn’t). But my dog ran around barking to scare it off before going to my little brother (4 year old) who was asleep and keeping watch over him while quietly growling to keep him safe.

I wanted to share my experience with slow cookers and why I think they're way better than microwaves for cooking. I've been using both for years, but recently I've completely fallen in love with my slow cooker, and I think you might too.

First off, let's talk about food quality. You know that disappointing feeling when you microwave something and it comes out rubbery or with cold spots? That's never an issue with slow cookers. They cook everything evenly and actually help meat become super tender. I recently made a pot roast that literally fell apart with a fork – try doing that in a microwave!

The flavor difference is huge too. Slow cooking allows all the ingredients to marry together, creating these deep, rich tastes that you just can't get from quick heating. Plus, the aromas that fill your house are amazing. I found this awesome slow cooker at https://athometouch.com/slow-cooker that's been a game-changer for my cooking.

Here's what really sold me on slow cookers: the convenience. Sure, microwaves are quick, but with a slow cooker, you can toss everything in before work, and come home to a perfectly cooked meal. No more standing in front of the microwave hitting the add 30 seconds button over and over!

They're also way more versatile than most people think. I've made everything from soups and stews to bread and even desserts in mine. And speaking of versatility, if you're looking for a quality slow cooker with multiple functions, check out the options at https://athometouch.com/slow-cooker – they have some great multi-purpose ones.

Another big plus is energy efficiency. While microwaves use short bursts of high power, slow cookers use less electricity over a longer period. They're also safer – no radiation concerns or hot spots that could burn you.

The health benefits are worth mentioning too. Slow cooking preserves more nutrients compared to microwaving, and you don't need to add extra fats or oils to keep food moist. Plus, since everything cooks so tenderly, you can buy cheaper, tougher cuts of meat and they'll still turn out great.

Let's talk about meal prep too. With a slow cooker, you can easily make bigger batches and freeze portions for later. I've saved so much money by doing this instead of buying microwave meals. And cleanup? Just one pot to wash instead of multiple dishes.

I'm not saying ditch your microwave completely – it's still great for reheating coffee or making popcorn. But for actual cooking? A slow cooker is definitely the way to go. It's changed how I think about preparing meals and made my life so much easier.

Has anyone else made the switch from primarily using a microwave to slow cooking? I'd love to hear your experiences!",1,1758940440.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

As a result, they have now provoked several official posts that are somewhat odd.**

**What kind of posts are these?** Almost 2 months after the last developer update, the developers of Chrono Odyssey broke the silence. But not because there are exciting news about the MMORPG, but because they are apparently repeatedly asked by the community when an update can be expected.

Part of these questions that were posed via the official Discord channel are addressed by the developers in a short video on [X](https://x.com/ChronoOdyssey/status/1970366940314247342), in which the community managers also share smaller impressions from the studio and their daily work – with scenes more about meals, shoes, and the commute to work.

# “Be patient, okay?”

In a second post, the developers clarify on [X](https://x.com/ChronoOdyssey/status/1970685344980050028): “There is no update because there simply isn’t one. The devs are currently very busy, so it will take a while until we can show you changes and results. Be patient, okay?” The post is accompanied by several praying emojis.

Finally, BongGun Bae, the CEO of Chrono Studio, intervened, standing on the side of the players. His offer on [X](https://x.com/bongunn/status/1970804485787365784): “Show us something small, and I will bring the team coffee and donuts tomorrow. The. Best. Motivation. Ever.”

Whether anything substantial will result for the fans is currently unclear. MeinMMO will keep you updated in case the developers reveal new details about Chrono Odyssey.

**What do I need to know about Chrono Odyssey?** Chrono Odyssey was supposed to be released this year for PC (Steam and Epic Games), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series. The new MMORPG by Chrono Studio provides a mix of theme park and sandbox, with a strong focus on PvE content for solo players and small groups of 3, 5, or 10 players (PvP exists but is supposed to be optional).

Due to the feedback after the beta in summer, the developers have decided to postpone the release to 2026. There are simply too many issues that need to be addressed, which will take time and result in further testing. The extensive developer updates after the beta revealed long to-do lists for the team.

1nrjw3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nrjw3b/we_called_her_scary_sherri/,We Called Her Scary Sherri," 
Seventh graders are always, well, let’s say *unique,* but Scary Sherri was a different breed entirely.

She came into our class in early November, a particularly strange time to enroll, which was the first strike against her. The teacher nodded at her politely, but even she seemed to avert her eyes as Sherri was led in front of the class by the flighty old school counselor.

“Everyone, we have a new student today,” the counselor said in her perpetually candy-coated tone of voice. “Please say hello to Miss Sharon Smith.”

“Sherri,” the girl mumbled, offering a shy wave without lifting her gaze from the ground.

The class droned a monotonous greeting at Sherri took her seat, the eyes of twenty five students following her all the way across the room. I don’t like to admit it, but I definitely joined in on the staring and silently judging: strike two was against her the second she’d taken off her jacket, and we all wanted a closer look.

Like many middle schoolers, Sherri’s hands were scribbled with different colored pens and markers, little doodles that she must’ve drawn in a nervous rush on the bus. But the farther up her arms we looked, the drawings got much more precise and, dare I say, intricate. They were all etched into her skin with black ink, carefully prodded beyond the point of erasing: Sherri was a thirteen-year-old with at least five visible stick and poke tattoos.

We all watched as she sat down and tucked a ribbon of black hair behind her ears, dutifully removing a pen and notebook from her backpack.

For a while, Sherri was simply another member of the class, albeit with two social strikes poised and waiting for the third. She didn’t stir up any trouble, staying mostly silent during class unless she was called on, sketching with a blue pen up and down her arm. Sherri was definitely pretty in a weirdly gaunt sort of way, but surprisingly, she wasn’t recruited to any cliques. No one seemed to want to talk to her at all.

“I think her whole goth look is pretty cool,” my friend Jessie said at lunch one day, eyeing Sherri from across the cafeteria.

“Then go talk to her,” Bethany urged.

Jessie shook her head, her eyes shifting anxiously in Sherri’s direction. “No way,” she said. “Something feels weird about her.”

“She’s *new,* not poisonous,” I said dryly.

Bethany raised a brow. “Then *you* go.”

I looked toward Sherri, watching as she pleasantly and wordlessly ate through her packed lunch, and shook my own head.

“Nah,” I said.

Sherri was reminiscent of a magnet turned the wrong way: nobody seemed to want to grow near her, and it seemed like the closer you got, the more she pushed away. She wasn’t mean or anything, and no one said much of anything about her. She was simply *there.*

And then Doug talked to her.

Inexplicably, one day, Doug walked right up to Sherri between homeroom and first period, waving at her and offering her the school’s most precious contraband--a can of soda. Sherri had laughed and accepted, and the two became friends quite rapidly. 

No one thought much of it. Doug had taken the leap that no one else had been able to, and now Sherri had a friend. It was incredibly mundane news, especially in the world of middle school drama ripe with boys talking to multiple girls and two girls having a crush on the same guy.

Doug passed away two weeks before winter break.

Our teacher informed us of this during homeroom, and tears were shed by all, myself included. Doug had been in the backseat of his parents’ car, coming home from the grocery store, when a drunk driver had struck the side of the car and killed him instantly.

Thirteen is far, far too young to die, and we were all faced with our mortality without preparation. Denial came and went, and unfortunately for Sherri, the anger of two hundred grieving, hormonal students was pinned on her alone.

Strike three had struck.

Since Doug had been Sherri’s first and only friend, it didn’t take long for the rumors about Sherri to start flying: by the end of the day, I could hardly tell what was true and what was a myth. According to my classmates, Sherri was an adopted weirdo who’d killed both her biological and adoptive parents, and her tattoos were trophies for every murder she’d committed. Someone else said that she was cursed, and that everyone she talked to would drop dead, leading to many, *many* lunchroom dares during that last week before break. Another student theorized that beneath her thick black bangs were demon eyes that would turn you to stone.

“She’s a witch,” someone said, waggling his fingers menacingly and glaring at Sherri from across the room. “She picks a victim, ensnares them, and *wham!* Next thing you know, you’re in front of a bus.”

“I heard she ate her real parents,” someone else said wisely. “And her adopted parents gave her up because she kept demanding human meat!”

Scary Sherri either didn’t know about the rumors or simply didn’t care. She was the same as always, sitting at her desk and testing new stick and poke designs with a blue pen, poring over her big, wordy mythology books. I pitied her, I really did, but seventh grade politics are no joke. As much as I wanted to talk to her and comfort her, telling her that everyone was just upset about Doug, I knew it would be social suicide to even express my compassion. That and her strange reverse magnetism was more than enough to keep me away.

She made no more friends in the next two weeks, and once winter break was over, she was gone. Transferred, our teacher had told us. And so began the legend of Scary Sherri, the witch, the demon, the murderer, who had come to our school simply to kill our classmate and vanished on the wind without a trace.

~

For a long time, that’s all Scary Sherri was: a legend. Throughout the rest of middle school and all of high school, Scary Sherri was the mystical deterrer of bad behavior, a threat that us kids would yell at each other when emotions boiled too hot. “I hope Scary Sherri gets you!” a girl would shout after her boyfriend cheated on her, and “watch out or Scary Sherri will find you and eat your soul!” was a frequent warning amongst students skipping class. Even when we all parted ways and left our small town for college, Scary Sherri lived on, her story being told over shared cigarettes and green.

I was certainly guilty of joining in on the storytelling--who wouldn’t be? Scary Sherri was a great spooky story, and since it was all bullshit anyway, I could dress up the tale however I wanted. Sometimes she pushed Doug in front of the car, and other times she’d been sacrificing a bunny the night before he’d died. It was all in good fun, and since I had no idea where Scary Sherri was, nor did I even remember her real name.

By the time I graduated college, I had almost completely forgotten about Scary Sherri. Other things occupied my mind--getting a stable job, decorating my new studio apartment, maybe even adopting a pet if my landlord would allow it. Much as I loved my new place, I was still broke as hell and swimming in student loans, and my budget for furniture and interview clothes was strictly limited to what I could find in thrift stores.

Not that I minded all that much: I’d been thrifting since I was in high school, and I knew how to find a good deal. New York City was sure to be overflowing with awesome secondhand gear. Bursting with the excited energy that only a recent grad in the big city could have, I set off for East Village, feeling ready to take on the world with my $54.

The first store was a bust--*way* overpriced, even for secondhand--but I struck gold in the next store.

“Sweet,” I whispered, practically fawning over the elaborately carved set of antique armchairs. *Five dollars each.* I was over the moon, taking a moment to simply bask in the glory of my luck. These things were *just* my style, and even though I hadn’t yet considered transporting multiple pieces of furniture to my apartment in Chelsea, I was ecstatic. 

My eyes darted wildly around the thrift store, intent on buying these chairs before someone else snapped them up, and that’s when I saw her: Scary Sherri, perusing her way slowly through the assortment of sweaters in the men’s section.

I wouldn’t have recognized her if she hadn’t been wearing short sleeves, and even then, her arms were far from what I remembered. From a distance, I couldn’t make out the specifics of her collection of stick and poke tattoos, but even the blurred, distant shape was a sight to behold. The ink swelled and danced effortlessly around her arms and shoulders, each bone in her arm drawn to scale against the skin and decorated to the nines. Even her fingers were tattooed, all in black, contrasting sharply with her pale skin. 

I stared in awe for a few moments, my eyes locked on the strange shape etched into her wrist, one of the relics from middle school. It hadn’t aged a day, only woven more intricately into the tapestry surrounding it.

More than anything, I wanted to walk up to her and say hello. I couldn’t pinpoint why, exactly--maybe it was guilt about how I’d ignored her in middle school, or maybe it was to get a closer look at those incredible tattoos. Whatever the reason, before I even realized I was doing it, I had abandoned my chairs and was drifting toward Scary Sherri, as though her magnetism had somehow switched directions in the past decade.

Once I reached her, I completely blanked on what I was supposed to say to someone who was basically a stranger, and all of my tact was abruptly abandoned. I leaned toward her and tapped her shoulder, blurting before I could stop myself.

“Scary Sherri?”

She turned rather abruptly, looking quite surprised, and for the first time, I noticed that her eyes were hazel--a vibrant, golden hazel. I slapped my hands over my mouth, embarrassed, my cheeks growing red-hot under my fingertips.

“Oh, my God, I am so sorry,” I said hurriedly. “I just--I’m sorry, that completely slipped out, it’s just--we went to middle school together. Is that weird for me to say?”

Scary Sherri regarded me with remarkable calm, cocking her head to the side like a curious dog, her long black hair sliding gracefully over her shoulders. “Which middle school?” she asked, her voice soft, slightly raspy.

“Um--Dalewood?”

Scary Sherri’s eyes cleared, and a thin smile lit up her face. “Oh, right! Seventh grade!” she said, her eyes swirling with an odd mix of sorrow and relief. “I’m so sorry about what happened to Doug. I take it that’s where ‘Scary Sherri’ came from?”

I flushed more violently, amazed at how much more beautiful Scary Sherri had gotten over the years. She was beautiful in an unconventional, gaunt sort of way, her skin taut over her slender features. Her tattoos snaked up her neck and, from what I could see, covered everything but her face--her legs, the tiny bit of exposed midriff, everything was painted with endless black dots, clustered just the right way to form images that seemed to move where she did.

“Uh, yeah,” I said, rubbing the back of my neck anxiously. “Yeah, we all sort of got it in our heads that you were a witch or a demon or cannibal or something.”

Surprisingly, Scary Sherri laughed. “Witch and demon I’ve heard before, but cannibal is new,” she said, her shoulders trembling as she tried to swallow giggles.

“We were pretty awful to you back in the day,” I admitted. “I’m really sorry about--”

“Oh, please, Diana,” Scary Sherri said, playfully swatting at my shoulder. “That was *years* ago. Don’t even worry about it. Trust me, if you think of the world’s meanest nickname, I’ve still heard ten times worse. Never been a lucky girl, and that shit leaves a reputation.”

I was about to pry, incredibly curious, but Scary Sherri’s yellowish gaze shifted over my shoulder,  her eyebrows crinkling.

“Uh, you were looking at those chairs, right?” she said, pointing. “You might wanna grab them before Grandma over there gets to them first.”

I whirled around, immediately ready to cut the throat of any old woman who tried to take my chairs. “Shit,” I hissed. “Thanks!”

I took two steps toward the chairs before pausing, turning back to look at Scary Sherri. “Wait right here,” I said.

Her head cocked once again, ever so slightly. “Okay. Why?”

“Because I need your number,” I said. “If you wanna join me for coffee sometime, that is.”

Scary Sherri’s eyes softened, and she nodded, a small smile lifting her lips. “Yeah,” she said. “I’ll wait here. Go get your chairs, girl.”

I returned to smile and rushed to claim my chairs, completely oblivious to the fact that I’d never, not even in middle school, told Scary Sherri my name.

~

Three hours into our coffee date, I was finally beginning to pinpoint why Scary Sherri’s eyes held so much woe.

The middle school rumor about her parents had been *partially* true--her biological parents had both passed away in a tragic accident just months after her birth, and her adoptive mother had died of heart failure, leading to her adoptive father committing suicide a few days later. Scary Sherri assured me, with a surprising amount of lightheartedness, that she had *not* killed them.

“If I did,” she said with a smirk, “I would’ve kept up their old house a lot better. Place was a dump when I finally got to move in.”

Scary Sherri also promised me that she was not a witch nor a demon--tragedy just seemed to follow her. Almost all of her friends, her girlfriends, her family members, even her pets had met untimely and unfortunate ends, which is why she tended to keep to herself.

“That must get lonely,” I said sympathetically.

“Sometimes,” she admitted. “But the people I do meet are wonderful, and they’re always worth the heartache. Especially the dogs. Those might be my fault, since I always adopt them out of hospice and spoil them to death. Literally.”

She was very casual about death, and strangely, I was charmed by it. It was beautiful. The universe seemed to take joy in stealing loved ones away from her, and she still found the strength to smile.

I told Scary Sherri about my dreams of being a social worker, even if my current job was nonexistent. She assured me that I would find one soon, especially with the growing acceptance of getting help for mental health issues. I asked her what she did, and she told me that she was a kayaking instructor on the Hudson. She loved being on the water.

I asked if she’d teach me how to kayak sometime. She regarded me with that calm, sad smile for a moment before nodding. She’d love to, she said.

~

My assumption had been correct--Scary Sherri was covered head-to-toe in tattoos, a fact that was immediately confirmed when she walked out of the kayak storage garage in nothing but a bikini. I asked what some of them meant, and she simply laughed, saying we would need a third date just to explain the meanings behind them all.

She dragged one kayak in each arm as we approached the water, beaming, her hair tied back into a long ponytail that swayed side to side with each step. I couldn’t stop staring at her, watching as her tattoos seemed to move in the fading sunlight, vines and flowers and snakes and symbols weaving in and out of her anatomically flawless inked ribs.

I was incredibly clumsy in the water, which was only amplified by the incredible grace with which Scary Sherri moved. She handled the paddle with unmatched deftness, laughing as she tried to show me the right way to effectively steer.

“Use your hips!” Scary Sherri called, standing up in her kayak and sticking the paddle vertically into the water. “Point your body toward the direction you want to go!”

“I want to go *forward!*” I laughed. “Why do I keep turning?!”

“The hips, Diana, the *hips!*” Scary Sherri yelled, swinging her own hips from side to side--how her kayak stayed afloat was an absolute mystery. “And you’re favoring your right arm! Put more juice into the left!”

I rotated in a complete circle without moving forward at all. I must’ve looked like an idiot, but it was worth it to see Scary Sherri laugh as hard as she did. She jumped into my kayak and grabbed my hands, twisting the paddle using my grip, successfully moving us forward a few feet.

“See?” she said, her words just shy of my ear. “It’s all in the hips.”

I turned my head and kissed her. She kissed me back, and the kayak capsized. We laughed, and I suggested we go to my apartment to get dried off--it wasn’t far from here, and I had just bought a bottle of white wine the other day. Scary Sherri said she preferred red, so we went to the liquor store first.

Back at my apartment, we drank it all and fell over each other, laughing. We kissed in my new chairs, we kissed against the wall, we kissed on my mattress, and I made sure to kiss every single one of her tattoos.

~

When I awoke in the middle of the night, Scary Sherri wasn’t next to me.

I sat upright, gathering the sheets over myself and looking wildly around the studio apartment for any sign of her, my eyes landing on a note pinned to the refrigerator. I shuffled toward it, rubbing sleep out of my eyes.

*Had to go to work,* it read. *I’ll be back with wine tonight. Wait right here.*

I smiled and clutched the note to my chest, falling back into the bed, too tired to wonder why anyone would sign up for kayaking lessons held at two in the morning.

~

Scary Sherri’s schedule was incredibly irregular, but as I was still unemployed, it didn’t bother me one bit. She slept at my place at least three times a week since it was so much closer to work than her own apartment, and I had no complaints. We spent many evenings in calm, blissful quiet, Scary Sherri’s head resting in my lap and pointing at my laptop screen as I scrolled through job openings.

It was a month before I finally got an interview, and when I did, Scary Sherri was even more excited than I was.

“You are going to do *amazing,*” she said as we settled into bed, stroking my hair as I checked my alarms again and again. “If they don’t hire you, they’re idiots.”

“If they don’t hire me, you’re going to have to chip in for rent, because I’m fresh out of cash,” I joked.

Scary Sherri smiled warmly. “If you need me to, sure.”

I tilted her chin up and kissed her. She smiled underneath my lips, soothing me into a fretful sleep.

~

Scary Sherri wasn’t there when I jolted awake at midnight, but she *was* there when my alarm went off, smiling and perfectly well rested.

“Interview time, babe,” she said brightly. “Come on, get up! Big day!”

“Five more minutes,” I groaned, throwing a pillow over my head.

“No more minutes!” Scary Sherri said, whapping her hands against the blankets noisily. “If you don’t get up, you don’t get breakfast!”

“Bagel and butter?” I mumbled.

Scary Sherri nodded, her golden-hazel eyes shimmering with an emotion I couldn’t quite place. “And cinnamon sugar,” she tempted.

~

As I adjusted the collar of my blouse, Scary Sherri walked up behind me, plucking at the flowing fabric.

“I have something for you,” she said, resting her chin on my shoulder.

I grinned, nudging my head against hers. “I only have a few minutes before I leave,” I teased.

Scary Sherri snorted. “No,” she said with a roll of the eyes. “Here.”

She placed her hand in mine, leaving behind something cold and round as her fingers slowly withdrew. “Hold onto this no matter what,” she said mysteriously.

I looked down at my hand, puzzled at the sight: a heavy golden coin sat heavily in my palm, slightly tarnished yet still glowing with warmth. I lifted it to my face, rotating it gently between my fingers, surprised at the heft that such a small coin could have.

“A gold dollar?” I said, giving Scary Sherri a dry grin. “What’s it for? Special vending machines?”

“For good luck,” she said, closing my fist around the coin. “Promise me you’ll keep it with you.”

“I mean, sure,” I said, still incredibly confused--I’d never heard of golden dollars being a good luck charm, but I supposed anything was possible. “I’ll keep it right here.”

I lifted my leg and dropped the gold coin into my shoe, safely tucking it under my toes for safe keeping. Scary Sherri smiled, her eyes slightly forlorn.

“I love you,” she said, catching me off guard.

I blinked and met her eyes, my face melting into a surprised smile. “Why do you say that?”

“Because I love you, Diana,” Scary Sherri said, rolling her eyes amusedly. “Now shush and go get a job.”

She smacked me from behind, jolting me toward the door, and I smirked over my shoulder as my hand met the doorknob.

“I love you too, Sherri,” I said. “Be back in an hour or so, okay?”

Scary Sherri nodded, waving as the door closed behind me.

~

The coin initially felt very strange in my shoe, but after a few blocks, I barely noticed it anymore. My heart was too busy glowing, constantly replaying Scary Sherri’s voice in my head. If Scary Sherri could love me, then dammit, I could do anything. I was going to ace this interview and no one was going to stop me.

I debated getting a taxi since my GPS was trying to steer me in all kinds of strange directions, but the sun felt so wonderful against my shoulders that I opted to walk instead. The NYC smog seemed to fade away, the skies clearing, the skyscrapers glistening, cars honking a beautiful song of love and new beginnings.

I wiped a joyful tear from my eye as I turned down a street I wasn’t familiar with, listening to the sounds of people chatting and shouting. My heart thrummed a tune as I passed a row of brownstone buildings, the jagged architecture a treat for my eyes to behold.

One of the doors whipped open as I passed by, and a woman came stumbling out, cowering and shrieking. I froze, turning toward her with wide eyes, only catching a glimpse of the man that had pushed her.

I didn’t even see the gun in his hand--I only saw the brownstone buildings vanish from view, replaced by an empty blue sky and an endless, penetrating darkness.

~

When I awoke, I immediately became aware of only one thing--this was *not* New York City.

I bolted upright, grasping at my chest, wheezing wildly as though I hadn’t tasted air in years. Nothing hurt, but nothing felt good, either. I gripped at my blouse, something coarse slipping down the fabric, my fingers like icicles against my clothes. 

It was so dark. Maybe I had passed out on the street? I blinked rapidly, trying to clear my fuzzy vision, hoping to make sense of my surroundings and only growing more confused.

The crystal New York City was gone, replaced with a haze of murky grey like nothing I’d ever seen before. The sky was tinged with red and orange, though with no apparent source--there were no clouds, no sunlight, nothing. Just smudges of grey and crimson like a painter’s failed abstract piece, higher than anything I’d ever seen, higher even than the sky itself. 

It was so *dark.* I struggled to get to my feet, my heels slipping against a ground that was grainy and damp, the coldest silt I’d ever felt seeping between my toes and scraping the undersides of my feet. I rubbed my eyes, clearing the sediment from my face, jostling it out of my hair and sending it cascading down my blouse.

The mist that surrounded me was of no color I’d ever seen before, caught somewhere between grey and blue and green and a deep, unending black. I held my hands forward, skimming my fingers through the fog, part of me expecting to cut through it like putty, but my touch did nothing.

“Hello?” I called, cupping my hands around my mouth and turning in confused circles. “Anyone out there?”

The response I received was as immediate as it was unexpected: “Shh.”

I nearly jumped out of my skin, spinning around wildly. I appeared to be entirely alone, but the whisper had been so close to me, right behind me. I clasped instinctively at my chest, searching for the reassuring pounding of my heart and feeling nothing.

“*Hello?*” I called again, panic rising in my voice. “Can anyone hear me?”

“Shh.” Once again, I heard it, but the disembodied voice was at least kind enough to elaborate. “Follow. Do not disturb the waiting.”

“Follow?”

And just like that, out of the darkness, I was able to make out shapes. Strange, translucent shapes, but shapes nonetheless. They were moving strangely, their dark forms twisting and curling in a manner unlike anything I’d ever seen, but they were also getting smaller. 

Whatever they were, they were moving away.

“Follow,” the whisper urged me once again.

I was too confused and too terrified to ask for clarification. Still seeking my heartbeat, I stumbled across the silty ground, clumsily making my way toward the shadowy figures as they curled and contorted deeper into the colorless mist.

It may have been seconds that I was walking, or it may have been hours, but at some point, I became acutely aware of sounds that were finally penetrating the air and making my breath catch in fresh panic. Moans, cries, gentle sobs, and confused whispers resonated through the dreary landscape, growing louder as my footsteps grew longer. My teeth chattered, and I joined them for a moment, a miserably confused choking sound bubbling from my throat before I could stop it.

“Please,” someone murmured, just to my left. “Please, do you have a spare?”

I kept my eyes forward, not wanting to look at whoever was speaking. Whatever these shadows were, I doubted I wanted to see one up close.

“*Please,*” someone else whimpered sorrowfully. “I can’t wait anymore. They won’t let me cross.”

I kept walking, swallowing down tears as they stung the backs of my eyes.

“*I beg of you!*” A voice shrieked just ahead, the sudden increase in volume setting off a chorus of groans and sighs from all directions. “Please! I deserve to cross!”

“I already told you, *no,*” a strangely familiar voice responded. “Either you pay or you wait. Those are the rules.”

“But I *need* to cross,” the crying voice wailed. “My wife!”

“And I *need* you to stop bothering me,” the familiar voice said exasperatedly.

My breath caught in my throat as realization struck me, and I let out a strangled cry, pushing through the shapeless crowd of silhouettes. “Sherri?” I called, my voice cracking.

I pushed directly through one of the dark masses, earning myself an indignant grunt of disapproval, but I no longer had the capacity to care. Finally, this confusing dream had something that made sense: Sherri was here.

“Sherri!” I said again, tripping over a plank of clammy wood and nearly losing my footing. “Sher--”

I stopped dead, my eyes growing wide at the sight of her before me.

It was undoubtedly my beloved Scary Sherri, but only someone with my knowledge of her could have possibly discerned such a fact. Her long black hair was swirling around her head slowly, purposefully, as though she were suspended underwater. Her clothes did the same, an unfamiliar black robe billowing outwards in plumes of black velvet and silk. Every tattoo was in place across her body, but instead of simply looking like they moved, they *were* moving--endless designs danced across her transparent skin, flowing and rippling around her visible white skeleton.

When Scary Sherri turned to face me, though her smile was the same one I knew, her eyes were not--two solid orbs of gold lay within her sockets, the skin on her face entirely transparent, showing every detail of her skull underneath. If I’d cared to, I could have counted every tooth in her jaw, picked out each minor imperfection in the bone beneath her flesh. I wasn’t even sure if I was looking at her or through her, but I could still easily make out of the softness of her expression, the sadness and relief blurring together in her eyes like they always had.

“Diana,” she said soothingly, her voice so wonderfully familiar in a world that no longer made sense. “Do you have your coin?”

“Sherri,” I gasped, staggering forward and grabbing onto her shoulders, relishing in the familiar feeling of her cool skin. “Where am I?”

Scary Sherri chuckled, and from this close, I could hear that her voice was not entirely her own--a thousand other voices mingled with hers, deep and high, smooth and gruff, gentle and stern. “Down here, it’s ‘Sharon,’” she corrected gently. “Give me your coin, babe--I’ll explain on the way.”

I looked up into her golden eyes, tears falling from my own, but I obliged despite my complete and utter confusion. Slowly, I leaned down and extracted the single gold coin from my shoe, holding it toward Scary Sherri with trembling fingers.

“Here,” I said. “Why do you--”

Behind me was suddenly a raucous uproar of miserable wailing and begging, shaking the unstable ground beneath my feet.

“Let me come with you!” a woman’s voice shrieked.

“I’ll trade anything for that coin!” a man bellowed, his voice cracking. “*Please,* young lady, I’ve been here for--”

“I told you all to shut up!” Scary Sherri snapped, procuring a massive and ostentatiously carved pole from the mist that surrounded us. She slammed the pole down, and a loud *splash* both silenced the herd of shadows and rocked the ground beneath my feet. I stumbled, but Scary Sherri tightened a slender hand around my arm, keeping me upright. “Unless any of you have payment, I will now be departing.”

A few more of the misty silhouettes moaned in disapproval, but none stepped forward. I stared down at my feet dumbly, finally able to make sense of at least one thing.

“We’re on a boat,” I said.

Scary Sherri smiled at me, unbothered by the horde of faceless masses that had just pleaded with her. “Shall we, then?” she said warmly.

Without waiting for me to answer, she lowered her pole into the water, pushing the mysterious shore and its wailing crowd away and engulfing us in silence.

~

“I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you sooner,” was the first thing Scary Sherri said as soon as the tenebrous coastline was out of sight.

For a long moment, I didn’t know what to say, and I simply stared at the water as it foamed beneath our boat. 

“Tell me *what,* exactly?” I said, my voice thin and rusty. “You haven’t told me anything. At all.”

Scary Sherri sighed. “You never did like when I sugarcoated things,” she said. “You’re dead, Diana. And so are all of those souls on the shores.”

I wished that I could have been surprised, but instead, I felt as though a large weight had been lifted from my chest. “Bummer,” I said, reaching toward the water, wondering what it felt like.

Scary Sherri swooped down and grabbed my wrist before my fingertips made contact, shaking her head. “Don’t touch it,” she said harshly.

I frowned. “Why?”

“It’ll claim you.”

I rolled my eyes, growing more and more frustrated by Scary Sherri’s non-answers. “Sherri--or Sharon, I guess--*where am I?* Is this hell? You said you weren’t a demon.”

Scary Sherri, much to my surprise, giggled quite amusedly. “I’m not,” she said. “I’m a ferryman.”

My brow furrowed as I looked up at her. “Sharon… you mean like…”

“Yes,” she said with a nod, pleased with my understanding.

I looked back down at the water, realization beginning to wash over me. “So you knew that I…?”

“I’m sorry,” Scary Sherri murmured, pushing her pole gracefully through the water once again. “I told you, I’m not lucky in the mortal realm. Souls only approach me when their time is close. They know that their current cycle is ending, and they remember to come to me when the time comes. I give them coins so they can pass… it’s not much, since I can only help so many of them, but He doesn’t want me handing out coins all willy nilly. The Underworld has been at capacity for centuries, and it’s better to keep some souls waiting on the shores. Even if it pains me to hear them cry, day in and day out.”

A heavy silence fell between us. I dragged my fingers along the soft wood below me, biting my lip.

“Your parents?” I inquired, lowering my head. “And your adoptive parents? Doug?”

“I was born to my parents because their time was nearest,” Scary Sherri sighed. “My adoptive parents came to me because they were so close as well. Same with Doug. With all of them.”

“You just follow them around,” I mumbled, my motionless heart somehow still managing to sink. “With me, you just…?”

Scary Sherri chuckled quietly. “I’ve explained this to you a dozen times, and I’ll explain it again,” she said, sounding almost entertained. “I have always found your soul. And I will always find it, over and over again. Until your cycles have run their course, I will be waiting for you with a coin in my pocket.”

I lifted my head, looking into Scary Sherri’s skeletal face, the gold orbs deep in her eye sockets. “You--?”

“This is the ninth time I’ve had you on my ferry,” she said wistfully. “Stop being a little shit in the mortal realm, and maybe you’ll finally get your second entrance into Elysium. I’ve got my fingers crossed this time--your last cycle got you into Elysium, and since you wanted to be a social worker in this cycle, I bet They’ll vote favorably. You were even blessed with Artemis' name--that’s gotta show for something. Just one more cycle, babe. Just one more.”

I met Scary Sherri’s eyes, bursting with questions, but she simply shook her head and lowered her pole into the water once again. The hushed sound of water lapping against silt had filled my ears once again, and she leaned down to kiss my forehead, a smile on her lips.

“Go,” she breathed. “Be cleansed. I’ll be waiting for you no matter what They vote.”

As the sound of tired voices and barking dogs filled my ears, a sense of familiarity washed over me, and I nodded all of my uncertainty away. “Okay,” I whispered. “I love you.”

Sharon’s smile widened, and she put my gold coin between her teeth, winking at me. “Good luck.”

The new girl came into our class in early October, a particularly strange time to enroll, which was the first strike against her. The teacher bounced up from her seat the greet the new student, but the nervous young girl shrank away from her, rumpling her hair into her face.

“Everyone, we have a new student today,” the counselor said, grouchy and dry as ever. “Say hello to Miss Zoe McAdams.”

“Hi,” the girl whispered without lifting her gaze from the ground.

The class droned a monotonous greeting at Zoe slipped toward her desk, the eyes of fourteen students following her all the way across the room. I watched her carefully, my heart pounding as she sat in the chair next to mine.

""Zoe?"" I whispered, nudging her shoe with my own. ""We're seat buddies now.""

Zoe glanced in my direction, tucking her hair farther into her face. ""Okay,"" she said uncertainly. ""What's on your arm?""

I looked down at my wrist, prodding the pomegranate I'd tattooed on myself a few weeks prior. ""A tattoo,"" I said. ""Did it all by myself.""

""Cool,"" Zoe murmured. ""I love pomegranates.""

""Really? Me too!"" I said, ignoring the way the teacher glared at me. ""Wanna come over after school? I can read you my super secret story, if you wanna hear it, since we're seat buddies.""

Zoe nodded. ""Okay. That sounds neat. Thanks, um... what's your name?""

""Sherri,"" I said, a smile splitting my face in half. ""My name's Sherri. And you're totally gonna love this story. I just know it.""

A while back, I walked away from a girl who meant so much to me. At the time, I told myself it was the right decision. Maybe I was scared, maybe I thought I needed space, maybe I didn’t fully realize how rare it is to find someone who truly sees you. But ever since I left, she hasn’t left my mind.

It’s not just missing her presence. It’s missing the way she laughed at the smallest things, the way being with her felt like home, the way she made me want to be better without ever asking me to. I’ve dated before, but nothing has ever come close to the connection I felt with her. It wasn’t perfect, but it was real, and now I can’t shake the feeling that I let something special slip away.

I don’t want to come across as weak or desperate, but I also don’t want pride to stop me from trying. I want her to know she’s still in my heart, that I regret leaving, and that if there’s even the smallest chance, I’d love to show her I’m serious about us. At the same time, I don’t want to overwhelm her or make this about my guilt. I just want to reach out in a way that’s honest and gives her the choice to decide if she wants to let me back in.

We have a very, problematic relationship, and I (F 23yr) have always been told that I have a lot of patience in dealing with my mother, I have put up with it for nearly all my life. 

I am worried about today though, since I usually always disassociate when M starts getting upset at me. So I heat up the food, and go sit down after a long day of work and school. I came home to finish my hw right away and start having everything prepped. The food was warming up, and I sit down and turn on the fan. BIG MISTAKE! She got so f* upset about the fan not being ""exactly"" how she wanted it. She kept gesturing to it and looking at me, I got so confused. I got up to move it, she got more upset, called me F* stupid and ran to her bed you know angry crying after turning off the TV, I just went back to finish cleaning the kitchen. She came back out upset I hadnt followed her to apologize for the fan and said I had no common sense and that I had to just know she wanted me to move the fan exactly to how its supposed to be. I said I can't read her mind, that she actually needs to speak up to SAY things. This upset her more. While she kept going I still had my bowl and spoon in my hand, stuck in that one place as she kept going at it. 

Now, instead of disassociating like normal. I got mad. Very mad and hadnt noticed I had broken tbe spoon, metal soup spoon in half with one hand until I looked down. She didn't notice, but whatever that problems still going, added to the thousands of things that are my fault, that I am to quote her 'retarded' at ( I mean no offense at all, that is just what she calls me) and that makes her eternally disappointed. That's never going to change, I realized that 3 years ago. While some parts of my life are going better, me finally being independent ij sown things and doing things I want to do, like going to buy myself a coffee. 

Im making this too long sorry, I just got worried at the fact that I thought about using the spoon against her. And the fact that I got so mad I BROKE A METAL SPOON IN HALF with one hand, that actually shocked me out of the dangerous thinking spiral of using the spoon. So yeah. Sorry just wanted to vent...

**Conclusion:** It is self-evident that the Iglesia Ni Cristo doesn’t teach a specific prophecy pertaining to Felix Y.

After paying deposit & rent, I had about $10 left to eat for the next two days until I get paid again.

I went to the store planning to grab some cereal and bread. On my way in, a homeless guy came up and asked if I could buy him a coffee. Without even thinking, I told him to come with me and grab what he needed. He was super polite, kept asking if I was sure, saying he didn’t want to be a burden. I told him not to worry about it. He grabbed a small meal and a drink. When we walked out, he looked at me with this genuine smile and just said, Thank You.

I came back to my room with store brand cereal, sat down, and just cried for about 30 mins. Not out of sadness, really, just this weird mix of  relief, exhaustion and everything. I’ve never been an emotional person, but something about today broke through whatever walls I’ve built trying to survive.

Around 150 people have been crowding on the first floor of an oxblood-colored apartment building on Pennsylvania Avenue long before the start of the fair. It is less than a ten-minute walk from the United States Capitol.Christ Church D. C., the evangelical church that will be founded here and today, is damn close to the center of power. Which is why it is a bit surprising that [Pete Hegseth](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/pete-hegseth-us-verteidigungsminister-teilt-video-mit-inhalten-gegen-frauenwahlrecht-a-bd87f51d-8d11-4115-acf7-5be7438ef78d), his family and Secret Service suddenly appears in the circle of the Pious.

Hegseth is Secretary of Defense of the United States and in this capacity defends the true faith not least. His body is with [crusader tattoos](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/donald-trump-nominiert-pete-hegseth-haben-seine-tattoos-eine-rechtsradikale-botschaft-a-4089ba46-1d46-480f-84ff-0104a92646db)Covered. In his book ""American Crusade"" he wrote in 2020: ""Our American crusade does not take place with real swords, and our fight is not with firearms. Not yet.""He is the only cabinet member in the service on this day in July. But he is just one of many in Trump's environment who belong to the world of extremist Christians and share a goal: to place America under Bible dictation.

# The visitors of this premiere service, most young, almost all white, mostly rich in children, are chosen polite. They welcome guests in their midst, as long as they follow certain rules (""no photos, no recordings""). They mildly ignore the two demonstrators outside on the street, their curses (""We curse you!"") penetrate muffled into this improvised whitewashed prayer room with two oversized US flags. And they nod satfully when Pastor Jared Longshore, blue jacket, blue and yellow bow, prophesies a kind of turning point in his sermon.His church will do what is done to save Washington from those who would rather listen to themselves than the Almighty. A pastor colleague has already announced that feminism and homosexuality will be attacked in this sinful city. Now Longshore says: ""For us, worship is warfare - and that's exactly what we mean."" He says: ""Christ or chaos,"" Washington has the choice. The city is [a swamp.](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-will-verbrennen-der-usa-flagge-mit-haft-bestrafen-a-cdb88cc8-f67a-48f3-8713-899af7ec0ad0) Christ Church has come to dry him out.



There is no shortage of churches in the capital of the USA. Around 800 places of prayer are available for the more than 700,000 inhabitants. In almost every street there is one, often hardly distinguishable from simple residential buildings. However, Christ Church, the newest addition and part of a widely branched global network called the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, is a special church in many ways.

# Muslims should deport themselves

Its founder, a gray-bearded preacher named [Douglas Wilson](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/pete-hegseth-us-verteidigungsminister-teilt-video-mit-inhalten-gegen-frauenwahlrecht-a-bd87f51d-8d11-4115-acf7-5be7438ef78d), was considered an extremist Kauz for decades, even among arch-conservative evangelicals. Like God's Berserker, Wilson ritually rails against the equality of men and women. But so be it, the frequent writer wrote: ""The man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, sows. The woman receives, surrenders, accepts.""The alleged [over-alienation of America](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-der-grosse-abschiebe-zirkus-des-donald-trump-a-ac2e9c47-43d7-4954-846e-b62e7b2df0d3) by non-Protestants is for Wilson infrevel. He wants to prohibit access to public offices for in practice or to encourage them to self-deportation, as he recently said on a video show. In [slavery ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-attackiert-smithsonian-erneut-heftig-a-518ec99e-712d-456f-b4d1-f310430fe031)he may not only recognize reprehensible things, sometimes they have led to ""real affection between the races"". The American Civil War, which has ended since 1865, Wilson does not yet consider it to be final.Occasionally, the man of God from Idaho shoots religious advertising clips in which he flares Disney characters and other symbols of a supposedly decadent way of life with a Havana cigar in his mouth and a flamethrower strapped. He leaves little doubt about his goals: Douglas Wilson wants an ""American theocracy"" - a country in which biblical law applies. Nothing else.

While until a few years ago, this was considered rather a delusion of Christian weirdos, a remarkable tectonic shift can be observed in Donald Trump's America. Without having significantly relativized any of his beliefs, Douglas Wilson has become from Maverick to the idol of many Christian nationalists - a politically and religiously far-right movement, in whose idea America was created exclusively by and for Protestant Christians.For about a year, Wilson has been passed around as a star guest on podies, podcasts and conferences of the Trump cosmos. The foundation of a Wilson's church within throw from the Capitol is therefore not only an act of divine charity. It is a declaration of war - and one of many indications of how close fundamentalist believers are [under Donald Trump](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-warum-ihn-seine-anhaenger-als-gesandten-gottes-sehen-a-43164ecd-847f-436a-845c-7c8432455c82) have moved to the heart chamber of the world power USA.

# Strange Bible Interpretation

The not just known as God-fearing 47. The US president has brought a large number of his, as he says, ""glorful Christians"" into the innermost circle of power. They sit at the head of ministries and federal authorities, on ambassador posts and top judge chairs and have often softened the commandment of the separation of state and church.And Trump's Christians are not just any Christians. Like Pentagon chief Hegseth, many of them adhere to the belief that the Bible, and only the Bible, must be the measure of all spiritual and secular things. Whereby Christian nationalists bend the Holy Scriptures at will in such a way that it allegedly also justifies misogyny, [gay and lesbian hostility](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-supreme-court-erlaubt-fehlen-bei-lgbtqi-inhalten-im-unterricht-a-d0322d34-049e-4356-8c87-f6182184c717), sheer [racism ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/rassismus/)and white fantasies of superiority.

Many heads of the [MAGA community](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/fall-jeffrey-epstein-warum-donald-trump-die-bekannte-staatsanwaeltin-maurene-comey-feuerte-a-21ffbb67-86a2-45d8-aa15-7e2ef8a686f1) are permeated by the fundamentalist Christian spirit. Among them is the influencer [Charlie Kirk](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/charlie-kirk/), who was killed in an assassination attempt in Arizona in mid-September and had intoxicated countless young Americans with his right-wing religious and right-wing extremist views until his death.He will now bring God back to everyday life ""like never before"", Trump promised last Sunday in front of around 90,000 people at Kirk's memorial service in Arizona, which increasingly resembled an evangelical recruitment fair. Members of Trump's administration announced that they would act with ""just anger"" against ""left-wing extremists"" who claim to have identified them as the backers of the murder. According to Trump's deputy chief of staff, the ""powers of evil"" will be eliminated.""A dangerous, authoritarian political theology has taken control of one of our two major parties,"" warns religious scholar Robert Jones, founder of the non-profit Public Religion Research Institute in Washington. Trump's administration is on a ""militant mission"" to make the country ""a white Christian America"", says Jones. And the question is whether the president understands what forces he has unleashed in his second term.The idea of making America a God-sadating state is as old as the New World. Even today, Christian nationalists in the USA refer to a papal bull by Alexander VI from 1493. The Christian religion should be ""spread everywhere"" and for this purpose ""barbaric peoples"" should be subdued. The pious European settlers then did a lot of work in the name of God, subjogated the Terra incognita and slaughtered indigenous peoples.

# Savior Trump

However, a continent governed exclusively by biblical law always remained a distant dream, especially after the first constitution of the United States of America was adopted in 1788. This explicitly prohibits the evocation of a state religion.Even in the recent past, nothing seemed like a theocracy on American soil could ever become a reality. In the early 1990s, around 90 percent of US citizens still called themselves Christians, their share fell to just over 60 percent 30 years later.

Last year, the Public Religion Research Institute asked Americans, among other things, if they agreed with the statement that the government should declare the United States a purely Christian nation, that a true American is a Christian, and that US laws should be based on biblical values. Only three out of ten people fully or overwhelmingly agreed. But: [Among Republicans](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trumps-notstand-in-washington-d-c-das-naechste-troepfchen-gift-a-630d7e19-1a1d-4a30-9d5c-afc983a82006) There were 53, 65 percent among white evangelicals. And they had far from giving up their Old Testament dream. To get closer to him, they choose as a savior that man who tends to marital infidelity, [greed](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/donald-trump-seit-beginn-seiner-zweiten-amtszeit-kaufte-er-anleihen-fuer-ueber-100-millionen-dollar-a-ba2a49d6-c591-4815-9277-4cbd14ed13e7), lies and envy and regularly disregards half of all ten commandments: [Donald Trump](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/donald_trump/).

# Fight against ""demonocrats""

Trump is ""God's chaos candidate"", the Texan TV preacher Lance Wallnau, one of the best connected evangelicals in the country, had already written in 2016. He had been anointed by the Almighty for a ""special purpose"". At first, many Christian nationalists still doubted this, the cursing, arrogant money screet from New York seemed too profane to them. But the alternative - a supposedly all-equalizing, ""woke"", anti-man and anti-white politics - was apparently even more frightening. 77 percent of all white evangelicals finally voted for Trump. Eight years later, it was 81 [percent.Today](http://percent.Today), countless Trump supporters are convinced that he has been sent to them to smash the ""demonocrats"" and their devilishly liberal worldview.

When the New York multi-billionaire began to warm up for a second term, various think tanks were already tinkering with meticulous plans for the Trump 2.0 era in the background in order to rule out similar chaos as in the first edition. This is how, under the leadership of the nationalist Heritage Foundation, also [""Project 2025"" ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trumps-100-tage-bilanz-was-der-us-praesident-bisher-erreicht-hat-und-was-nicht-a-caa64c21-19b4-4687-9385-63bfaed4d65d)was created. , a blueprint for the authoritarian transformation of the USA into a secluded, proto-American, biblically influenced nation.The Christian nationalists among the creators of ""Project 2025"" - and these were quite a few - imagined a country in which the Christian-Evangelical family led by a patriarch is the focus, [abortion is ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/schwangerschaftsabbruch/)prohibited and homosexuality is ostracized. A country that expels other believers or demotes them to second-class citizens. In which Christian schools suppress the state and no longer spread the alleged misconceptions about [climate change, ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-landwirtschaftsministerium-stoppt-foerderung-fuer-solar-und-windkraft-a-7a5a7276-8dfd-44eb-a917-a95a8cc1476b)racism, diversity or [evolution](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/evolution/). In short: a country that replaces knowledge with faith, as if the [Enlightenment had ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/aufklaerung/)never existed.

# Not pious, but radical

""All sectors of society are to be brought under God's control according to this idea,"" says historian and book author Kristin Kobes Du Mez. This applies not only to religion, but also to politics, education, economy, family, media and the arts.All this sounds less pious than radical. It is an attempt to turn the wheel back decades, if not centuries - to a time when men were still men and solved conflicts in their own way: with trust in God and revolvers. Jesus and Jesse James. It is an attempt to resurrect an original American myth. The emphatically masculine right-winger response to an identity policy from the left, which is perceived as feminine and morally sour. And the attempt to eliminate the [democratic rule of law](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/john-legend-sieht-usa-in-autoritaeres-regierungssystem-abgleiten-a-2cc865fb-a10b-4b4b-b340-0781cf5c65b0).Trump claims to have nothing to do with Project 2025. But: He immediately prepared the way for almost every one of these ideas after his choice. Seen through the Christian-fundamentalist glasses, his political drum fire of the first months, the raids against migrants, the attacks on schools and universities, the redistribution in favor of the rich, the revenge campaign against political opponents are not pure arbitrariness. They systematically serve to create a godly state - or what the supposedly Bible faithful think to be.

# God's cleaner

Does he believe in what he does? Or is the religious leader just another role in the inexhaustible reservoir of Donald Trump?Without the votes of the Bible fanatics, he would probably never have won the election. Trump was almost forced to serve himself to them in time as God's cleaner. Already in February 2024, he said at an election campaign with religious radio makers that Christianity was ""the most important thing that this country lacks, the most important thing!"". Once in office, he will promote ""pro-God content"" in all decisions.Long before MAGA, Trump had found a kind of god. A quarter of a century ago he met the television-loving ""Televangelist"" Paula White, whom he later [made his ""spiritual advisor"".](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/video/trumps-spirituelle-beraterin-betet-gegen-daemonische-sender-video-99027884.html) She believes in the ""Prosority Gospel"", according to which [empires like Trump](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-donald-trump-nimmt-den-armen-und-gibt-den-reichen-der-anti-robin-hood-a-0c192c0f-8d29-4f34-bc37-986f9a41bbe3) must be especially high in God's favor. She also speaks ""in tongues"" or prays for miscarriages ""of all satanic pregnancies"". She is said to have a great influence on Trump.  
  
He staged himself more and more often via digital media as a sacred figure of light, who alone could save America from ruin. And if something jumped out for him, all the better: His ""God Bless the USA"" Bible finds a raging sale. It costs $60 a piece.Since the bullet [of an assassin ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-attentat-us-senatsausschuss-attestiert-secret-service-gravierende-maengel-a-b3ff0690-6cba-4024-b51e-0c20c70f2bd8)only touched him during a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania in September 2024, but did not seriously injure him, Trump seems finally convinced that he is a new Messiah. The self-exaltation culminated in his speech at the inauguration in January: ""My life was spared for good reasons. I was saved by God to make America great again.""Mummy dance or megalomania? Maybe both.

# Bible fidelity in the highest state offices

The pace at which Trump has since pierced the partition between the state and the church is breathtaking. With one of his first decrees, the 47. US president in February the White House Faith Office, which is primarily intended to fight ""anti-Christian and anti-Semitic prejudices"". His boss: his leader of the faith Paula White. When Trump had lunch with more than 60 business bosses in mid-July for the sake of good faith, White rejoiced: ""President Trump not only makes America affordable, prosperous and strong again - he also puts faith back in the center.""During a ""National Prayer Breakfast"" Trump announced that he would authorize the Department of Justice to prosecute ""anti-Christian violence and vandalism"" with the full severity of the law. Recently, he allowed federal authorities to pray and even proselytiate again.""My life was spared for good reasons. I was saved by God to make America great again.""Donald Trump, US PresidentGovernment employees, according to the regulation, should ""convince others of the correctness of their religious attitude"". Christianity is not explicitly mentioned in the directive, apparently with regard to the constitution. But everyone knows that this does not mean Mohammed's teachings first - especially since Trump has long placed his eager Christians everywhere.This also applies to some of the highest offices in the state. As in his first term, President [Russell Vought](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/donald-trump-vs-fed-chef-jerome-powell-rufmoerder-im-dienste-des-praesidenten-a-c49a7a49-4b0c-4194-94e8-415a1b88aa63) to the head of its budget office and thus to the head of the White House. Vought is one of the architects of the »Project 2025« and himself a declared Christian nationalist. His greatest concern is the ongoing oppression of Americans by ""climate change extremists"" and ""awoke militants"".

# Overlap with Jewish settlers

Another Christian nationalist, former presidential candidate [Mike Huckabee](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/mike-huckabee-us-senat-bestaetigt-ihn-als-botschafter-in-israel-a-0059a2bb-5ffa-47c2-a05b-63e9babbef85), sent Trump to Jerusalem as his ambassador. Many evangelicals maintain financial and political ties with radical Jewish settlers in the West Bank. They believe that the second return of Christ can only take place when all Jews have returned to the Holy Land.

Huckabee has not yet thought of condemning Israel's alleged war crimes in the [Gaza Strip](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/gaza_streifen/). On the contrary: he rigorously denied the hunger crisis in Gaza. Years ago, Huckabee had already made it known that ""such a thing as Palestinians do not really exist"".A friend of Huckabee - and Trump - is the evangelical businessman Johnnie Moore, who calls himself a Christian Zionist. He is the head of a Christian advertising agency that, among other things, has promoted Ark Encounter in Kentucky: a fundamental Christian amusement park in the belly of a supposedly original, 155 meter long Noah's Ark.Since June, Moore has also led the [Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/gaza-seit-ende-mai-sollen-1-373-palaestinenser-bei-der-suche-nach-nahrung-getoetet-worden-sein-a-bcb9cc75-f314-42e2-a611-a43d20ee684d) The private US organization, which works closely with Israel's army, is supposed to provide the Palestinians in the devastated coastal strip with the essentials. Near the four distribution centers of the GHF, more than 850 people waiting for food died, most of them shot by the Israeli army, which led a senior UN official to comment that the distribution points were ""sadistic death traps"".

# Minister of Defence of the Faith

One of the most ardent Christian fanatics is Trump's ""Minister of War"" Pete Hegseth, who can now always pray with like-minded people since the church to which he belongs opened a house of worship in Washington. Only recently[, ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/pete-hegseth-us-verteidigungsminister-teilt-video-mit-inhalten-gegen-frauenwahlrecht-a-bd87f51d-8d11-4115-acf7-5be7438ef78d)Hegseth released [a video ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/pete-hegseth-us-verteidigungsminister-teilt-video-mit-inhalten-gegen-frauenwahlrecht-a-bd87f51d-8d11-4115-acf7-5be7438ef78d)on Platform X in which his, as he says, ""mentor"" Douglas Wilson calls for the abolition of women's suffrage. Hegseth had his evangelical house pastor from Tennessee fly in to Washington for services in the Pentagon.Former Fox News host Hegseth [has a certain enthusiasm for »Crusaders«](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/donald-trump-nominiert-pete-hegseth-haben-seine-tattoos-eine-rechtsradikale-botschaft-a-4089ba46-1d46-480f-84ff-0104a92646db) . His steeled body, which he used to show often and gladly, is adorned by tattoos of an AR-15 rifle, two crossed muskets, a Jerusalem cross and the saying ""Deus vult"" (God wills it), with which medieval crusaders once went into battle.The strange mixing of Catholic symbols with evangelical sentiment does not necessarily have to be an oversight. In view of the reduced total number of Christians in the USA, there have been attempts for decades to bridge the theological-ideological trenches. In 1994, for example, the ecumenical paper »Evangelicals and Catholics Together« caused a stir. Scientists assume that the efforts have recently borne fruit. ""We see more and more unity across the Christian currents,"" says historian Kobes Du Mez. ""They're all raming together for a common cause.""

# The Role of JD Vance

An interesting figure in this context is Trump's [Vice President JD Vance](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/jd-vance-und-pete-hegseth-proteste-in-washington-beim-besuch-bei-der-nationalgarde-a-0c815ed2-5bd1-4914-8d10-10f68f004947), a former atheist who only found a Catholic faith in 2019, but maintains connections to the ultra-nationalist Protestant camp.During the 2024 election campaign, for example, one of the most popular currents of the Christian nationalist camp, the New Apostolic Reformation, organized so-called Courage Tours throughout the country: a kind of political-religious iterant circus of self-appointed prophets and apostles who called on their thousands of listeners to join the ""God's Army"" and ""prepare for a war"". In Monroeville, Pennsylvania, the evangelical initiators welcomed a special star guest shortly before the election: the Catholic [JD Vance](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/j-d-vance/).

Not everyone on Trump's team is so obviously flirting with a Christian nationalist ideology. But it is striking how much other high-ranking Republicans also show off their religiosity. For example, Mike Johnson, [the majority leader ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/big-beautiful-bill-us-republikaner-treiben-donald-trumps-steuergesetz-im-senat-voran-a-7e8dd5bb-d5cf-4489-bc4f-20858e996d23)in the House of Representatives and formally the third most powerful person in the state, says that he gets his ""worldview"" from the Bible. In the Capitol, the heart of the oldest still existing democracy in the world, he once had himself photographed kneeling while praying with his [colleagues.In](http://colleagues.In) front of his office stands a supposedly inconspicuous flag with green pine on a white background and the inscription ""An Appeal to Heaven"". It originally comes from the War of Independence and is considered a hallmark of Christian nationalists.[ Samuel Alito](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-supreme-court-erlaubt-fehlen-bei-lgbtqi-inhalten-im-unterricht-a-d0322d34-049e-4356-8c87-f6182184c717), one of the most controversial judges at the Supreme Court and opponent of abortion and marriage for all, had already waved the same flag in front of his private home in 2023.Trump's Minister of Justice Pam Bondi, who has to supervise the separation of state and church in office, was pleased to hold the first hearing of a government commission on religious freedom in the private Bible museum in Washington in June. Founded in 2017, the house is a ""poil for Christian nationalists"", according to research by the »New York Times«.At the same place, Trump announced his ""America Prays"" initiative in early September and called on all compatriots to intercede together so that the nation can celebrate its 250th birthday. Birthday will be strong and prosperous next year. At the same time, he promised to enforce a ""right to pray"" in public schools. Also probably part of his recently expressed plan to ""get to heaven"".

# ""Ministry of Penance and Holiness""

How shameless Trump's Republican partisans now walk between the worlds could be observed at the end of June at the Washington Hilton. There, Jesus freaks, Trump enthusiasts and businessmen, officials, dignitaries, miracle healers frolicked in windowless rooms for a weekend. At a stand, caps with the inscription ""Jesus Is My Savior, Trump Is My President"" received great attention. Right next to it, a self-proclaimed ""Ministry of Penance and Holiness"" announced pigeons who can hear again and women who have died without a uterus. One floor below, a pastor announced: ""We are not democrats, we are Bible crats.""

Invited to this bizarre fair of credulity was the arch-conservative Faith & Freedom Coalition, which was founded in 2009 out of self-defense against the alleged [Beelzebub Barack Obama ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-laesst-offenbar-portraets-der-bushs-und-von-barack-obama-umhaengen-a-2bf3c0a1-4149-4a00-969d-6b59755e1b93)and serves as a lubricant between republican right-wingers and evangelicals. The greeting to the conference was adequately sober: ""The devil works overtime to make up for lost ground. That is why we must mobilize more Christians than ever before.”On the podium during these three hellish days in the capital: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump's top [border guard Tom Homan](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/los-angeles-militaereinsatz-soll-macht-von-donald-trump-konsolidieren-a-7243ed86-d17e-45be-917e-9bc93100c9ec) , Senators [Ted Cruz ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/ted_cruz/)and [Lindsey Graham](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/lindsey-graham/), Trump's former press secretary, representatives of the White House Faith Office and many others who have been sitting on Washington's shifters since January.

# An anti-democratic movement

What Christian nationalists spread with increasing self-evidentness is ""absolutely incompatible with our democracy,"" says the religious researcher Jones. And not only because the ideology glorifies white heterosexual men as God-given rulers. Other beliefs of the Bible fanatics could also be made it impossible to agree with a free society - including the exclusion of entire population and religious groups, the denial of racism or homophobia.Above all, however, Jones is concerned that political conflicts in Trump's America would no longer be fought out as a civilized competition of ideas, but ""as apocalyptic battles between good and evil"". This could tempt you to no longer want to defeat political rivals at the ballot box, ""but by locking them up, driving them out or even killing them,"" says Jones, whose book ""White Too Long"" about racism in Christian nationalist circles was removed from the US Naval Academy at the instigation of the [Pentagon](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/pentagon/).  
  
And although the right-wing Christian seducers always emphasize that they meant only a spiritual struggle with their bellicistic oas of war and battles, Jones says: ""Our polls have shown that Christian nationalists twice as often as others think that political violence could be justified under the circumstances.""

# The Christian Storm of the Capitol

Where this can lead, the [6th ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/sturm-auf-das-us-kapitol/)showed by way of example.[ January 2021, ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/sturm-auf-das-us-kapitol/)when a mob in the belief that the Savior Trump had been cheated for his election victory, the [Capitol in Washington](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/donald-trump-warum-seine-waehler-eine-politik-gegen-ihre-eigenen-interessen-unterstuetzen-a-c3b592f2-b9b4-4dc7-ab53-020745981d5e) Stormed. Among them, many unleashed people who knelt down before their march, asked God for help and then hunted Trump opponents with waving flags - including the ""Appeal to Heaven"" flag.

In the delusions of the apocalyptics, it was a kind of exorcism. In fact, it was the first transfer of power accompanied by violence in the history of the United States. Amazingly enough: While there are numerous indications that the storming of the Capitol was essentially shaped and orchestrated by Christian fanatics at the time, this aspect almost completely fell under the table in the official investigation report. Trump has now pardoned a large part of those involved.God's work apparently also believed to be done by the father of five, Vance Luther B., when he shot a Democratic politician and her husband [in Minnesota in ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/news-des-tages-israel-iran-krieg-gewalt-in-den-usa-jeff-bezos-hochzeit-a-669488c4-7729-4655-8473-813c28235395)mid-June. It was probably only intended as a prelude to a long slaughter. Investigators later found a list of dozens of names of possible victims on the [57-year-old.As](http://57-year-old.As) is now known, B. studied at a Bible college, whose evangelical founder once demanded that every Christian should speak at least one ""violent prayer"", a prayer of violence, a day. Later, the man moved to the [Democratic Republic of Congo ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/demokratische_republik_kongo/)for a while, where he condemned abortion and homosexuality as a guest preacher, among other things. After the bloodshed of Minnesota, he texted his children: ""Dad went to war tonight.""Trump and his family treated the double murder as no more than a petitness. There was no shouting, no speech. When asked why he didn't let the flags hang at half-mast at federal authorities, the US president replied: ""For whom?"" Three months later, however, after the right-wing extremist Charlie Kirk had been murdered in a similarly tragic way, Trump participated in the front row in the de facto canonization of the ""martyr, who had openly preached xenophobic, misogynistic and queerphobic throughout his life.  
  
God willing?

It takes a very idiosyncratic interpretation of the Bible to justify what the predominantly white Christian nationalists demand and sometimes do in Trump's religiously whipped America. Why some researchers speak of ""shoom Christianity"", which coats an extremist worldview with a believing robe.

# Test Laboratory of Theocrats

In [Trump's America](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-und-der-kampf-gegen-amerikas-minderheiten-gehoeren-wir-noch-dazu-a-50133cf1-204c-4acc-b9c7-904091dd8d83) However, this form of exclusive piety has long been on the rise. May less radical currents have difficulty filling their churches on Sundays - many of the nationalistic sols do not have these worries. This is perhaps nowhere better to see than 4000 kilometers west of Washington, D. C., in the wasteland of Idaho, where the flame-throwing preacher Douglas Wilson is already well advanced on his way to an American [theocracy.Moscow](http://theocracy.Moscow) is a tidy, artistic place with cute wooden houses, where you could shoot new episodes of the cult series »The Waltons« at any time. The extensive university town with its more than 25,000 inhabitants is located on the edge of the Palouse, a gentle hilly landscape in the northwestern USA, which was once a prairie and is now a large carpet of wheat. Interrupted only by the 1500 meter high Moscow Mountain and one or the other human settlement. Moscow is the largest of them in the state of Idaho. The river that meanders through is called Paradise Creek.

On a Sunday in July, there is a lively coming and going on the northeastern edge of the town. Hundreds of people, mostly young families with three, four, five children, stroll through a huge parking lot in the direction of a simple brick church, which is large, but not big enough for the crowd of those willing to pray - which is why three services are celebrated this morning. Right next to the church, between piled up sand hills, there are wooden pallets and bricks, excavators, concrete mixers and a large shell with a column portal. On a sign it can be seen that he will become the heart of a huge new school town with manicured lawn and fountains. A football field with a grandstand is already ready. Strangers who linger around here ask a very friendly security man if he can help. He drinks from a thermo mug with [Trump portrait](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/nato-gipfel-seelenmassage-fuer-trump-als-strategie-zum-erfolg-a-eba8e064-bcc1-4684-a554-f5c6fe5fe119) and the inscription ""Best Dad Ever"".

# From the cradle to the stretcher

This is the ""Logos"" construction area, the latest expansion of what some call ""Doug Wilson's Empire"". Which is hardly exaggerated. In the 50 years since the ex-soldier settled here, he has not been inactive. The Christian Church leader founded five churches in Moscow and the surrounding area alone, and three more are planned. In total, the umbrella organization Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches maintains around 160 places of worship in the USA, Europe, Australia and [Asia.Here](http://Asia.Here) in Idaho, Wilson has also built a Christian school, a Christian college, and a Christian publishing house. He has published countless theological writings, children's books and books of poetry there. He distributes his messages through his own streaming service, his own podcast, his own YouTube channel. His parishioners, he calls them ""Kirker"", own galleries, theaters, office buildings, pubs, restaurants and shops for daily needs.If you want, you can live in Moscow from the cradle to the ley exclusively in a Christ-Church world.

And that's what many want, says Wilson, when he asks for a conversation in his office in downtown the day after the triple service. 3000 Kirkers meanwhile lived in Moscow, many of them ""fled from the repressive, tyrannical dictates"" of so-called democratic US states. To him, to Moscow, where in the meantime ""the essential elements of a truly Christian community"" are present. An ""experiment"" is that which runs a beta test in Idaho, possibly to repeat it at some point on a larger scale. Wilson is satisfied with the results so far: »God is kind.«

# Schools as ""ammunition factories""

And as he sits there in jeans and a denim shirt, in a tiny office full of books, a portrait of the Scottish primeval presbyterian John Knox and a Gary Larson cartoon calendar, Wilson has nothing of that Bible berserer that you know him from his videos. Admittedly, this is ""a bit polemical,"" says the 72-year-old almost shyly.He seems to wonder that he is suddenly a sought-after man and his ideas have become courtable. He knows who he owes it to: ""Donald Trump's presidency is like Christmas every day for me."" Not that he likes everything Trump does. But: ""He's like chemotherapy. It's poisonous, but it kills the cancer faster than it kills you.If it continues like this, the one religion, secularism, will really be replaced by a better one – its own. ""Protestant Christianity is in our DNA,"" says Wilson. Therefore, America must again be populated predominantly by Protestants and perhaps ""by a handful of Catholics and a handful of Jews"". Just as it used to be, perhaps, once. The rest should be evangelized or disappear.

Wilson has patience. And he has access to more than 500 educational institutions nationwide through the Association of Classical Christian Schools, which he co-founded, he calls them ""ammunition factories"". They are his best bet on the future. In Moscow, more than every third child is already raised Christian. Something is growing. Violence is not necessary, he rejects it - unless ""for defense"".

# A city is afraid

If you listen to Wilson like that, you could almost believe that in Moscow everything is going its peaceful and - may I write this? - evolutionary way. If it weren't for people like Sarah Bader, who says, ""Moscow has fallen. Wilson has crippled this city."" Bader herself was a student in Christ Church's ""Ammunition Factory"" before she was suspended at the age of 13 because she had criticized the smeal of [slavery ](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/sklaverei/)there. As a result, she also gave up on her parents and left Moscow, but has since returned to warn against what she calls Wilson's ""extremist cult"".

Bader can tell a lot over a cup of coffee about how Kirker gradually bought up a large part of Moscow's city center. How shop owners in Kirker houses were fired after they criticized the church or organized a fundraising dinner for a food table run by the queer community. As most of them now preferred to be silent in order not to be boycotted by Christian zealous people. Like Moscow, this once so tolerant town - an island in conservative Idaho - is about to capitulate to [fundamentalists.In](http://fundamentalists.In) her podcast ""Sons of Patriarchy"", Bader has made serious accusations against Christ Church, which also deal with multiple mistreatment and abuse of women, which Wilson denies. Bader says she has therefore been threatened anonymously several times. When she wanted to bring the podcast live to Moscow with her fellow fighters, the venue canceled her reservations shortly before. ""This city is afraid,"" says Sarah Bader.And indeed, it is not easy to find someone in Moscow who wants to talk openly about their experiences. The owner of the local comic shop speaks only on the condition that her name is not mentioned. She is lesbian and married, she finally says with moist eyes, it breaks her heart to see queer children of Kirkers in Moscow who have to deny themselves. It is ""not a contradiction to be Christian and lesbian"". She also reports of attempts at intimidation.Once, in protest, she attached a comic page from the fifties to her shop front. There you can see Superman standing in the circle of teenagers and saying: ""Remember, boys and girls, like your school, your country also consists of Americans with different skin color, religion and origin."" Moscow's Kirker would not have liked that.For the faith fanatics, the S on the superhero chest has probably stood for Satan since then.

Earlier in our relationship, I was terrified to fall in love with you, not because I didn’t feel safe, loved, seen, or heard, but because I knew that even a lifetime with you would never feel like enough. And time with you just goes by so fast.

But over the course of this long, beautiful engagement, I’ve been reflecting on these feelings, and I’ve realized what a gift it is to have this kind of love - our kind of love, one that feels like home. 

I cannot wait to continue cherishing every moment we have together: every laugh, every heartache, every milestone, every ordinary day… through all the chaos and the quiet.

So today, I make you these promises.

* I promise to never watch the next episode without you.
* I promise to get jiggy on every dance floor with you.
* I promise to visit every new coffee shop with you.
* I promise to keep creating our own traditions: with me, you and Sushi, of course.
* I promise to choose you every day.
* I promise you’ll never have to face the world alone.
* I promise to build you a boat when you feel like you’re drowning.
* I promise to be your loudest laugh and your best adventure.
* And despite how painful it may be at times, I promise to always be a Ravens fan and stand by your side through the worst disappointments of your life.

Lastly, now I know without a doubt that this kind of love isn’t just for a lifetime — so when all those promises have been kept, I make you one more: when death comes to take my hand, I will hold yours with the other, and I promise to find you in every lifetime.

Something that was stored away for a long time has finally come due, and Tristan is to retrieve it. He's so busy that he barely has a moment to breathe, so I go in his place.
What I bring back is an old roll of film. The manager warned me that if it wasn’t developed soon, its age might cause it to be ruined beyond recovery.
But when I have them developed, frame after frame is filled with Winnie Leigh, his first love. Her smile looks so sweet in those pictures that they nearly suffocate me.
What about me, one may ask? I never once appeared on his albums.
The office door slams open. Tristan bursts in, already out of breath. ""Anna, is your life really so empty that you have to dig through mine?""
I turn toward him, the man who's usually so composed. I neither question him nor break down.
Instead, I speak slowly. ""We're getting a divorce.""
Tristan frowns and thrusts the stack of photos into the shredder. He then looks back at me. ""They're gone. Do you still want a divorce?""
A bitter smile tugs at my lips. ""Yes.""


Chapter 1

Impatience flickered in Tristan Spallone's eyes. He yanked at his tie, snapped open his cufflinks, treating me not like his wife but like an opponent he had to bring to heel.
His voice was low, heavy with that familiar pressure that always seemed to shrink me. ""For a handful of old photos? Anna, don't start with me. I don't have time for this.""
""I'm serious,"" I answered evenly, holding his gaze.
Tristan didn't bother with words any longer. He closed the distance between us in a few quick strides.
Towering over me, he caught my chin and tilted my face up to his. His scent and warmth, the same things that had once unraveled me, now wrapped around me like a snare.
""Alright, sweetheart. You've been wanting to get our wedding photos taken, haven't you? We'll go once I get through these next few days.""
It was the same thing again. Every argument, every letdown, always dissolved into that empty promise, as if the words themselves carried a spell strong enough to mend every scar.
Tristan made that promise over and over again, yet not once had he kept it.
I knocked his hand aside and stepped back, forcing space between us.
""No. I don't want anything anymore,"" I said quietly.
The steady chill in my voice snuffed out the last flicker of warmth in his eyes.
""Anna, my patience has limits. Don't threaten me with a divorce. You won't be able to bear the cost.""
Tristan's voice was soft, yet laced with a dangerous edge. He didn't add another word or even spare me another glance. He simply turned on his heel and walked away.
This time, I didn't chase him, didn't clutch at his sleeve, didn't sob and beg him to stay.
I just stood there, staring after him, until his footsteps grew fainter. The sting in my nose began to spread, sharp, hot, and unrelenting.
The photos had only just been developed, and already they lay in shreds. But the face on them was already carved into my memory.
So this was Winnie Leigh. She was beautiful.
I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breaking into sobs, but the tears spilled anyway, rolling down my hand like beads from a broken necklace.
Time blurred. I couldn't tell how long I sat there, not until my eyes ran dry and the sobs finally stilled.
I sniffled, picked up my phone, and called my best friend, Lily Ludlow. She was a lawyer.
""Lily, help me draft a divorce agreement.""
On the other end, she hesitated for a few seconds before speaking, her voice heavy with concern. ""A divorce agreement? Anna, are you serious? You love Tristan. Why would you suddenly want to end it?""
""That woman's back. I suppose it's time I stepped aside,"" I murmured.
The line went still. Then, Lily whispered, ""God… She's really back.""
I hadn't spoken her name. Lily didn't need me to.
Winnie was Tristan's first love. I had never laid eyes on her, yet her name had sat in my heart like an invisible thorn for five long years.
That first winter night after Tristan and I were married was bitterly cold, yet he insisted on working late in the study.
I opened the door with a steaming cup of coffee in hand, and there he was, staring down at an old photograph. His fingers brushed over it with a tenderness so raw that it stole the breath from my chest.
At the sound of my footsteps, he shoved the photo deep into a pile of books, his face gone cold. ""What are you doing here?""
I stopped dead in my tracks, my hands shaking. ""Who is she?""
He held his silence for what felt like forever, as though torn between hiding and confessing. At last, he said in a low, detached voice, ""Winnie Leigh.""
That had been the first time I heard the name, and it became the nightmare I would never escape.
From then on, no matter how soft his words or how kind his gestures, the image of him staring at that photo in the study lingered in my mind. It held a tenderness he'd never once shown me.
Lily asked nothing more. In a careful voice, she promised to prepare the divorce agreement for me.
When I ended the call, I drew in a long breath. This time, I wouldn't foolishly wait for Tristan to open his heart to me.


Chapter 2

By the time I left the office, I felt hollowed out, as if every bit of strength had been drained from me.
When I passed the Spallone clubhouse, grief pressed down on me like a heavy weight.
After days of barely eating, my low blood sugar level sent the world spinning. My vision blurred to black, and I caught myself against the wall by the entrance, barely managing to stay upright.
Just then, a black Bentley I knew too well eased to a stop at the door. Behind the wheel was Tristan. In the passenger seat sat Winnie, her makeup flawless.
Tristan's gaze flicked past me, not stopping for even a beat, as if I were just some random stranger. He yanked the car door open and strode straight into the clubhouse.
I had no idea how much time had passed. Cold sweat was pouring down my face, and I was about to pass out when the clubhouse doors finally swung open again.
Tristan walked out with two bottles of whiskey dangling from his hand. The instant he saw me still standing there with my head down, his brow tightened.
""Come on. Isn't a ride what you were after?""
""I didn't want that,"" I whispered.
He brushed off my words, caught my wrist, and shoved me into the backseat of his car.
""Faking illness now? That's your new trick to bother me? Anna, if you want a ride, call the driver. Don't stand in my way. I don't have time for this.""
He used to always bring me coffee. Out of pure habit, he passed me one of the bottles of whiskey in his hand. I never touched alcohol, so I left it alone. Seeing this, he set it down without a second glance.
A heavy silence settled in the car.
Winnie suddenly turned from her seat in front, flashing me a courteous smile. ""You must be Anna Jovine, huh? Tristan talks about you all the time. I should thank you for looking after him these past few years.""
Her voice carried a thin layer of arrogance, the way a hostess might thank a maid for her service.
Before I could even catch my breath from the sting of it, Winnie laid a hand on her stomach and said, ""Tristan, my period just started. My cramps are killing me.""
Tristan quickly pulled out some painkillers and a heat patch, pressing them into her hand. ""Here. Take these, and put this on your stomach.""
Winnie smiled. ""You've always been the one who looked out for me. I still remember that time we were on business in Sirelia. My period started in the middle of a snowstorm. It was freezing outside, and you kept my stomach warm.""
Tristan answered instantly, as if it were the most natural thing. ""That's just what a gentleman does.""
I curled into the far corner of the backseat, small and out of place. I kept still, listening as they traded stories that belonged only to them—from a snowy night in Sirelia to the sunrise over Mount Astrelle.
I wasn't part of any of it.
Streetlights streamed past the window, one after another, like splashes of whiskey. My eyes drifted to the two bottles Tristan had set on the seat.
Our first date had been in a whiskey bar. I remembered him ordering the fiercest malt they had, sliding the glass toward me with a single push, his gaze shadowed and intense.
""Drink it, and I'll marry you.""
I wasn't a drinker. But that night, I threw the alcohol back in one reckless swallow, not knowing what possessed me. The whiskey seared my throat raw, and my heart went wild in my chest.
The rest of that night blurred into a drunken stupor.
What I never forgot was waking the next morning in Tristan's strong embrace, a ring shining on my finger. Tears of joy spilled down my face as I thought myself the happiest woman alive.
It wasn't until much later that I learned of Tristan's greatest regret—that he'd never handed that glass of whiskey to Winnie.
A bitter smile crossed my lips. Now, at last, maybe he could.
Memories surged up in relentless waves, and a bone-deep weariness dragged me under. I sank into a troubled, uneasy sleep.
When I opened my eyes again, the car was already sitting in the villa's garage. Winnie was gone. She must've slipped out without me noticing.
Tristan was turned toward me, his brow furrowed deep. His voice was low as he said, ""Anna, did you really have to pull a stunt like that just to catch my attention? If you wanted a ride back, all you had to do was say so.
""Why put on that fainting act at the clubhouse entrance?""
His tone was sharp and laced with impatience. I couldn't quite tell what had him so wound up. Perhaps he was just angry that I'd cut into his stolen moments with Winnie.
""Tristan, you've got it all wrong. I never wanted you to bring me back.""
He snorted, as though my denial was nothing but stubborn pride. ""Oh, really? And were you planning to crawl home in that state?""
I met his gaze without flinching. ""I can take a cab. Tristan, I'm not useless without you. I went along with everything before because I loved you, but that doesn't mean I can't survive if I leave you.""
He stared at me like I'd just told the funniest joke he'd ever heard, the derision in his eyes only sharpening. ""Leave me? Anna, by all means, try. Then we'll see who ends up regretting it—you or me.""
I didn't bother to argue further. Once he saw the divorce agreement, he'd realize I was serious this time.


Chapter 3

My knees gave out as I stepped out of the car. I could barely stay on my feet, let alone walk.
Only then did Tristan seem to grasp that I wasn't faking anything. Wordlessly, he scooped me up, carried me into the bedroom, and laid me down with care.
The dizziness and weakness I felt clung to me stubbornly. Eyes shut, I didn't even have the strength to lift a finger.
Tristan pressed a glass of glucose water to my lips, and in that imperious tone I'd long since grown used to, commanded, ""Drink.""
I drained the glass of glucose water without a word.
That was Tristan's modus operandi. He'd let me down, then throw me a scrap of affection as if it made up for everything. The endless whiplash between cold and warmth had left me lost in doubt for five long years.
Did he ever truly care about me? Chasing the answer to that question was pathetic, and I'd wasted five years doing it. It was time to wake up.
I couldn't be bothered to figure out what was going through his mind. I murmured, ""Thanks.""
Tristan stayed put at the foot of the bed, staring down at me. ""Aren't you going to ask me anything?""
I shook my head calmly.
He seemed a little put out by my reaction, and, unusually for him, actually started to explain himself. ""It's not what you think. Winnie's just here because our family business is in trouble, and we need her—""
I cut him short. ""As she should.""
Tristan's eyes searched my face, as if he might catch the smallest crack in my composure, but there was nothing for him to find.
""Anna, it's just work between us now.""
I nodded. ""I know.""
He went quiet, leaned down, and wrapped me in his arms. He then tried to kiss me.
He thought a kiss would smooth everything over like it always had. But this time, I turned my face away.
Blindsided by my refusal, Tristan stopped short, his face hardening in an instant. ""Anna, I'm running out of patience. Don't push me.""
I refused to meet his eyes.
That night, we slept in separate rooms. He let me have the master bedroom and took the guest room instead.
…
By the time I woke the next morning, Tristan was already gone.
I'd already made up my mind to leave, and I wanted to make a clean break. Thus, I went straight to the administration office and handed in my resignation.
Ben Fulton, the man in charge, gaped at the letter. ""Madre Anna, what are you doing? Don Spallone only reassigned you. He never told you to quit.""
I froze. ""Reassigned?""
Ben stumbled over his words. ""A few days ago, you touched something in the family vault without his permission. He was furious and fired the old vault keeper.
""But with the family short on people and no one else to fill the spot, he temporarily made you the one guarding the vault.""
A chill cut straight through me. Again, it was because of that damn roll of film.
Because of Winnie's film, I was being shoved off to guard the vault—the most thankless post in the entire organization.
I forced down the storm tearing through me and asked, ""So who's taking my place as head of intelligence?""
Ben's voice dropped to a whisper. ""Winnie.""
My legs almost gave out, and I caught myself with a palm to the wall. Even if I was already set on leaving, hearing that still struck me like a blade to the gut.
Tristan had never once given me any special treatment in the Spallone family. I had clawed my way up to head of intelligence on my own. And yet, with one word, he handed the position over to Winnie.


Chapter 4

One day, Tristan threw a lavish dinner to celebrate Winnie's official appointment.
Standing in the banquet hall, he introduced the radiant, trusted aide at his side, his praise and high hopes for her plain in every word. He told everyone to look after her from now on.
A murmur rippled through the room.
Was this truly the same Tristan who had always been so cold and uncompromising?
Meanwhile, I, his wife in name, sat forgotten in a corner, no more than a guest who didn't matter.
Tristan's gaze swept the crowd and brushed past me, light as a shadow.
Just then, Winnie's heel wobbled beneath her, and she lurched forward.
Tristan, who had been calm a moment ago, shifted in an instant. He hurried forward and caught her, his grip firm yet taut with tension.
My hand tightened around the stem of my glass. I couldn't stand to watch their closeness for another second. Turning away, I slipped out onto the terrace for air.
The cool night breeze made me feel a little better, but it also carried Tristan's conversation with his friend to my ears.
""So, another cold war with Anna?""
Tristan offered a distracted grunt.
His friend sighed. ""You're so damn stubborn. When are you going to swallow your pride and actually try to make peace with Anna? Women like her don't come around every day.""
""I know.""
""Then, why keep hyping up Winnie right in front of her? All that's going to do is make things worse between you two. What if Anna finally gets fed up and leaves?""
""She won't."" Tristan paused, then said with complete confidence, ""I'll just soothe her if she gets jealous. She'd never walk away from me.""
Tristan was still brimming with that same old confidence. He honestly believed I'd cave first and come crawling back like I always used to.
I shook my head.
Just then, Winnie's voice drifted up behind me. She'd slipped over at some point without me noticing, a triumphant smile playing on her lips.
""Fancy seeing you here, Anna. Out for some fresh air on your own? I feel bad. The moment I showed up, I ended up taking your place in the Spallone family.""
I caught the challenge in her voice and replied coolly, ""Winnie, are we even that close?""
Her smile only widened. ""I barely know you, but you should know me, right? There's no way Tristan hasn't mentioned me.""
I wasn't about to argue, so I turned to go.
When I didn't give her the flustered blow-up she wanted, she decided to put on a little act. She purposefully lurched forward and slammed into the balcony balustrade with a shriek.
""Anna! Why did you push me?""
Of course, Tristan came running at the sound.
The moment he saw Winnie's glistening eyes, he turned on me like a whip. ""Anna! What the hell is wrong with you? You dared to lay a hand on her with everyone watching?""
I met his gaze without offering a word of defense, my voice cracking as I forced out, ""Tristan, I'm asking you one last time. Do you believe her, or me?""
He didn't answer. He only looked at me with eyes cold and heavy with disappointment, then turned and gently helped Winnie up.
That was all I needed to hear.
I bit down on my lower lip until the sharp taste of blood spread across my tongue, and still I felt nothing.
A complicated look flickered in Tristan's eyes. He started to speak.
But Winnie, sagging against him, cut in, her voice small. ""Tristan, my back really hurts. We should go to the hospital.""
Tristan quickly picked her up. As he moved past me, he didn't spare me so much as a glance.
That was when the Spallone family soldati came over, courteous but firm. ""Apologies, Ms. Jovine. This is Ms. Leigh's celebration. Anyone who isn't friendly toward her isn't welcome.""
I drew a deep breath and blinked the tears back.
""I get it. Don't bother throwing me out. I'll leave on my own,"" I said, eyes red-rimmed.
When I went back to the villa for my suitcase, I spotted an elegant card on the table in the living room. It was an appointment card from a premier wedding studio, with Tristan's and my name printed on it.
I had no idea when he'd left it.
He'd finally remembered the wedding shoot he'd promised me, the one I'd pleaded for for five years. But it was too little, too late.
I tore the card to shreds, dropped it in the trash, and went straight to the airport.
On the plane, I took out my phone and sent Tristan one last text.
""The divorce agreement and my resignation letter are on your desk. Don't forget to look at them when you get back.""
After that, I popped out my SIM card and snapped it in two.
Tristan and I would never see each other again
