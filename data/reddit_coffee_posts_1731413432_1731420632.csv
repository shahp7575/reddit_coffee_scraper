I gave up caffeine(coffee) a LONG while ago and have just been drinking tea which has helped so much. But of course yesterday I was extra sleepy and decided to drink coffee. BAD IDEA. I woke up this morning with crippling anxiety, had a panic attack and just barely made it to work. 

Mini vent sesh but also wanna say if you’re in a routine that works for you… KEEP DOING IT, don’t think “oh maybe I can have ONE cup of cofeee since I’ve been doing so good” DONT. 
Trust me today has been terrible and I truly think the coffee has made it worse.

Storytime:

Marcus swept into the accounting firm as the new CFO, armed with big city ambitions and a list of changes he wanted to make. Among his targets was Sarah, a seasoned accountant who'd kept the books with quiet competence for a decade. Her methodical, traditional approach didn't align with his vision for modernization, but he needed a reason more substantial than ""she's not innovative enough.""

One afternoon, Marcus cornered Jamie, the firm's data analyst, in the break room. ""Hey, I need your expertise on something,"" he began, laying out his plan to monitor Sarah's computer activities. ""What's the best way to track everything she does? I'm sure we'll find something...""

Jamie, who'd helped Sarah troubleshoot Excel formulas for years, stirred their coffee thoughtfully. ""You know,"" they said, choosing their words carefully, ""monitoring tools are like opening Pandora's box. One CFO I knew tried this and ended up learning way more than they bargained for - everything from someone's foot fungus treatment to their fertility struggles. Trust me, once you know these things, you can't un-know them.""

Marcus waved off the warning with a dismissive laugh. ""Please. How bad could it be? Besides, Indiana's at-will. I just need something concrete to justify the change to the partners.""

Two weeks later, Marcus stormed into Jamie's office, face flushed. Jamie looked up from their database queries, already knowing what was coming. ""Found something interesting in those logs?"" they asked innocently.

""She's pregnant!"" Marcus hissed, closing the door. ""Eight weeks. She's been looking up morning sickness remedies and maternity leave policies. She hasn't even told anyone yet.""

Jamie leaned back in their chair, letting the irony sink in. ""So... about that at-will employment?""

Marcus slumped against the wall. ""I can't fire her now. It would look like..."" He trailed off, the legal implications dawning on him.

""Like pregnancy discrimination?"" Jamie supplied helpfully. ""Funny how looking for a reason to fire someone sometimes gives you the perfect reason to keep them.""

For the next seven months, Marcus had to watch as Sarah received congratulations from colleagues, arranged her maternity leave coverage, and continued her decade-long streak of impeccable bookkeeping. Every time he passed her desk, he was reminded of the analyst's warning about learning things he couldn't un-know.

Jamie, for their part, kept their schadenfreude professionally concealed - except for the occasional knowing smile when Marcus had to sit through baby shower planning meetings. Sometimes the best lessons in management came from learning things the hard way.",1,1731420284.0,antiwork,0,0.67,False

I have baristas who get away with doing nothing and no matter how much I coach them some are just “you hate me” or “you aren’t considering how I feel”. And this happens to all of our SSVs. When we approach our manager (even our second manager we randomly have right now) nothing changes. The manager says they listen to me when I bring concerns to them, considering I can put up with a lot and when I go to them that means nothing is happening after a period of time, but it their actions don’t match. I’m consistently being gaslit by upper management (managers and DM) and I am so done with all of this tug-of-war. I’m just done.

# Reading

**Childhood Reading**

> **How would you teach reading?**  
> *It would be the same way I was taught. It would be with phonics. It would be with physical activities of tracing letters, learning the combinations, all the different phonetic sounds, all the combinations of the vowels and the consonant clusters. And ultimately, once you have those basic tools, not forcing it. You have to find things that you enjoy reading. Because I mean, look, I'm a New York Times bestselling author. I've been doing since I was a teenager, if you give me a book that I don't want to read, it is physically painful for me to read that book. I don't enjoy it. I will do other things. I'll go play Minecraft. But you give me a book with a flaming sword on the cover, and I'll give it a chance. I've read and I'll read everything. I really do read, not just fantasy, but if you have to find something in it that appeals to you. And this this goes for everything in life, if you can't find a kernel of pleasure in it or satisfaction You are not going to do it. You are going to procrastinate or avoid it entirely so that ultimately would be it. If you have to shovel trashy books onto your students in order to get them to read, do it and if they really fall in love with it will lead them to greater and better things.* [2]

> **What did your reading look like at what I assume is age seven to twelve, that conditioned you to put so much detail from so many different sources in your series?**  
> *I fell in love with reading and to answer your question more specifically, I read, I read, and I read. I was one of those kids that my parents would take me to the library. I would come in on Monday I would get a stack of books and I'd have that done by the weekend and repeat on Monday. The way my parents would discipline me was by not letting me read books. I was reading so many books that they were getting concerned that I wasn't interacting with anyone. I was getting weird, which I probably was. I've noticed this especially in guys. There is a certain mentality where you hyperfixate on something when you're trying to understand it and when you're trying to really master it. That's the sort of thing I was doing with the reading. I was trying to understand it. The local library was an old Carnegie library. I asked them one time, when I would have been 23 or 24, how many books I had checked out from the library. There were books I checked out more than once, but it was somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000. That was it. I just was mainlining fiction.* [6]

> *I read fantasy because I love beautiful language. I read fantasy because I love seeing images that I've never seen before and will not see anywhere else but in fantasy. And I love reading fantasy because when it's done well, the type of fantasy I like to read, it feels mythic, it feels inevitable, it feels awe-inspiring. It leaves me with a tingle down my spine. It leaves me wanting to visit the world where the story takes place even if there is a Sauron or an evil magician or monsters. It makes me dream and I search for books that have that feeling. And there are very few books that give me that feeling. I can't remember a modern book that I've read that gave me that feeling recently, which is why sometimes I go back and reread my Tolkien or my Ursula K. Le Guin or whomever else I might be remembering from my childhood. And it's why I write books. I write books to try to give myself and you the feelings that I get when I read something that really touches me. If it weren't for that emotional response, I'd go do something easier.* [6]

> *It's very frustrating for me, but I read very little these days because I am so busy writing and I'm so busy with my family. Maybe part of that is when you're an adolescent, you're trying to find your place in the world. Like Eragon was, you're trying to understand how the world works and where you fit into the world. And sometimes you do that through fantasy, sometimes you do that through romance or historical fiction or nonfiction. And there are fewer stories aimed at 40-year-olds and our place in the world. Or once you're an adult and you've got things set, it's the fewer stories that apply to you. But I do still love reading and I wish I had time to read more. I have a huge to-read pile. The only book I've really read this year was Fourth Wing. And that was because I did an event with Rebecca Yarros.* [6]

**Blood Meridian**

> *I read Blood Meridian this past year by Cormac Mc Carthy. Still don't know if I actually liked the book. It's incredibly self-indulgent in places, but there's also some incredible actual language and writing in the book.* [2] 

**The Worm Ouroboros**

> *I really like The Worm Ouroboros by E.R. Eddison, which I have been recommending for 20 years. I don't think anyone ever reads it, because it's written in faux Jacobian English. It took me three tries to read the darn thing, but I love it to death.* [6]

**The Martian**

> *There are plenty of books that perhaps have rather prosaic writing, but the characters are interesting and the story is good. And I'm sure we can all think of books like that that have been massive best sellers. One example perhaps would be The Martian. I quite enjoyed the character and the story. Not sure I read it really for the prose style. And I'm not dinging it, it's very effective for what it does, but it's not poetic.* [2]

**Consider the Lobster**

> **Since you brough up the morality of eating, if you haven't read David Foster Wallace's Consider the Lobster---**  
> *Oh, I've read it. I have thoughts on it.* [2]

**Shelly Shapiro**

> *I'm a fantasy fan, and I really like maps. Some of you might feel the same way. In fact, I remember when I met R. A. Salvatore, I had noticed that in some of his books, his maps were drawn by someone called Shelly Shapiro. And this stuck in my head, because my edition of Lord of the Rings has maps drawn by Shelly Shapiro. And I mentioned that to him. And he said, ""Oh, yes, she's my editor!""* [3]

**Others**

> *I love Dune, just the first one. I love the Wizard of Earthsea trilogy by LeGuin. I love the Gormenghast trilogy by Mervyn Peake. ... Smilla's Sense of Snow by Peter Høeg, the Ladies Detective Agency series, Anna Karenina, lots of Jane Austen, lots of Dickens, so hard to pick just one.* [6] *Great Expectations with the original ending- I'm persnickety about some of these things.* [7] *I look up to Sanderson when it comes to productivity.* [8]


**Internal Narrator**

> **Do you read with an internal narrator or without?**  
> *Strangely enough I can do it both ways. If I'm reading really fast, especially if it's techincal stuff, non-fiction especially, I can't say I'm hearing words in my head neceerilly, but most times I'm hearing the words in my head. And when I write, I tend to intensely see the image of what I'm trying to convey, like it's a movie.* [7]

**Movies**

> *My parents wanted my sister and me to be sort of exposed to the wider world and culture a little bit, even though we were living literally in the middle of nowhere in Montana with no internet, no radio and no television reception. So what we did is we watched a movie with dinner every night. For decades. I've kind of seen everything. I once had a conversation with Quentin Tarantino, and I'd seen some films he hadn't seen. To be fair, he'd seen a lot I hadn't seen, and they weren't really ones I wanted to see either. I was recommending Communist Westerns to him, and he was recommending exploitation films from the 60s and 70s, so the conversation went exactly as you would expect.* [6]



# Writing Advice


**Plotting**

> **How do you assemble your plots?**  
> *Painfully. Usually I have an idea for a scene or an emotion, which is the key, the thing that makes me want to write a story. So, a young boy finds a dragon egg. Okay, that's what I want to write about, but that's not a story. And then I try to decide what the story is about. Is it a coming-of-age story? Is it a tragedy? Is it this? is it that? I need to know what type of story it is I'm trying to tell and then I assemble it via a whole series of if-this-then-that questions to myself, what-if questions. And it helps knowing what the character wants. Let's say Eragon wants to kill King Galbatorix, versus what the character needs. He needs to grow up. But that's what the story is. And figuring out the conflict between those and then how to stymie the character, how to show them what it is they need to achieve, but they're not ready to grasp yet, and so they retreat from it. And then how do they build toward that knowledge again and incorporate it into themselves so that they can then be transformed at the end, so they can achieve what they need to achieve, assuming it's not a tragedy? And that's assuming this is a character-driven story versus something like Sherlock Holmes or James Bond, where the character does not change. Instead, what changes is the character's grasp of the world around him. Who's committing the murders? Who's trying to take over the world? Now the character has to learn these things, and that's where the dramatic excitement comes from for the audience. I know this is all very vague in many ways, especially if you're starting out, so I would recommend a book called Story by Robert McKee. It's a screenwriting book. I found it extremely helpful and could only have written Eragon after reading it. And it's very technical in terms of what goes into building a plot. I do not recommend doing everything he says verbatim, don't be slavish to him, but it's a good guide for how to think about story.* [6]

> *Whatever it is you're doing in your story, you should have a deep understanding of it so that before you write your book, if you had to, you could sit down with someone and verbally tell them the story and it would make sense. If you don't have that ability, I would say you don't know what your story is and you're just gonna get yourself into trouble trying to write it. So that would be one. That is plot, plot, plot.* [4]

> **What would be your main advice for someone who insists on writing their own series?**  
> *You kind of have to insist if you're going to put that much words or pages. I like your admission that you're asking about a series and not just one book. You're going for a series. That's impressive. Most of the advice I would give would be the same as if you're writing a stand-alone novel, just go right back to plotting. You want to know where you're going as much as possible so you don't kill a character in book one that you need book three.* [4]

> **Writers have plot points that to go to book four where you're definitely setting it up in book one. What does that look like in your thoughts? I'm imagining a lot of red string, clips hanging, and a whiteboard. What does that look like for you in practicality?**  
> *Just like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia? It's not quite that insane. Mostly, I just have a bunch of notebooks that I write in, and then I transfer my thoughts to the computer. And I keep a file where I dump worldbuilding and plotting ideas, and as those tie together, I accumulate more and more. But the thing is, most of it is in my head. If someone were to come into this and try to write the next four books based on the outline that I have, they'd have to invest some serious labor to pull that together from what I have around. Because it's so many pieces. And I actually have been meaning, I just don't have a chance. I've been meaning this year to sit down and write out one big document so that I can show it to my team, I can show it to my editor, and if something does happen to me, someone else can come in and say, oh, well, here's a general plan, and this is where we're going.* [4]

> **How does your brain work?**  
> *I like patterns. I visualize stories in interlocking shapes. I love three-dimensional puzzles, like interlocking wood puzzles. But ultimately all of it is driven by the emotional reaction I get to stories.* [7]

**Worldbuilding**

> *If you're writing sci-fi fantasy, you should know how you're breaking the laws of physics. Whether it's with magic or technology. Because if you are doing something different than the physics we know then that determines what is physically possible in your setting. It's really good to know what that is and what the implications are before you start writing, because that will influence everything from combat, to perhaps travel times, industry, religion.* [4]

> *The challenge one would encounter in writing any character who's from a different culture or a different species is that you both want to stereotype, but don't want to stereotype. And if you end up writing a non-typical member of a larger group, specifically to make the point that while an individual is different, you may actually lose what makes that group distinctive in some way. Star Trek ran into this problem quite a bit when they would write about, let's say, Llamas or Klingons or Vulcans, where you can end up having a whole group feeling very similar, but you do meet the individuals who feel distinct. So I think that would be the biggest challenge I'd have in my mind, that the Urgals are not going to react the way you necessarily react, but at the same time it's not like they're completely alien. Every time someone says that if we meet aliens, they'll be so incomprehensible that we won't be able to understand everything. Look, we pet dolphins. I know what my dog is trying to communicate with me. I've seen jumping spiders that look happy. We do already have experience communicating with non-human intelligences. Knowing humans, we'll go, ""can I pet it? can I eat it? will it try to eat me? can we be friends?"" I think all of that would play into it.* [1]

**Writing Schedule**

> **What does your writing schedule look like?**  
> *Basically, get up in the morning, grab coffee, answer business emails for about an hour, try to read the whole entire internet, always fail, and then nine to five it's work. I used to work a lot in the evenings but now that I have kids that's not really an option because I need family time. They need family time. So that's probably costing me at least a book here or there, but that's okay.* [6] *After 20 years of working one way, I'm still kind of trying to figure out how to get my brain to work in another way, but it's getting there. But mainly it's butt in seat, put words on paper, and if I'm not actually writing, then it's other business-related activities.* [2] *I'm very very consistent with it and I usually work weekends and holidays and birthdays. That's the only way to get anything done, especially with books this big. This year I've been doing nothing but write the screenplays, so that's been interesting.* [6]

**Insecurities**

> **Do you still struggle with imposter syndrome? If so, how do you get around it?**  
> *Dude! Let me tell you a story. When I was 19 or 20, I was at San Diego Comic Con, and I got to meet Alan Dean Foster. He's a science fiction and fantasy author. At the time I met him, I think he had written 120-some books. He did the novelizations for some of the Star Wars movies, and he's very well-established. I asked him, ""Does it ever get any easier?"" And he stopped in the middle of a crowd of thousands and started laughing. And he said, ""I always start every book thinking I know exactly what I'm doing, and it's going wonderfully, and I get about halfway through the book, and I feel like I'm a horrible writer and I'm a fraud, and everyone's going to realize what a horrible writer I am. I'm never going to figure this out. I'm never going to be able to finish it. But I keep working, and somehow it all works out in the end."" So absolutely. I will say the more success you have, the more confident you get that you can pull it off. ... The main thing is to accept that you're going to make mistakes, that mistakes are inevitable, and that's a natural part of the process. So if you can accept that, then you don't get discouraged when you make those inevitable mistakes, and then you just keep working and don't give up. That's really the main thing, persistence. Persistence is a superpower.* [1]

> **What do you to get past the fear of screwing up the story that's been in your head?**  
> *It is an issue. But my fear of not telling the story in the long run is greater than my fear of telling it imperfectly. It's something every author deals with and at a certain point you just have to put your insecurities to the side and say, ""I'm not perfect, I'm going to do my best. If there's something wrong, I will do my best to fix it. At the end of the day, that's as good as I can do. And I'm shoving it out into the world and moving on to the next project."" I still take great care with editing, revising, rewriting, but at the same time I don't want to spend 20 years obsessing on one thing.* [4]

**Motivation**

> **Do you have any advice for staying motivated to write?**  
> *If writing a story is desperately important to you, you can find 30 minutes to do it. You can find an hour to do it somewhere. You just have to find some joy and enough to do that. I don't believe this whole idea of discipline. Look, someone who gets up at five in the morning to go for a three mile run is A, crazy, and B, getting some sort of psychological pleasure out of it, whether it's from the fitness, they get some enjoyment out of it. Otherwise they wouldn't do it. Even if it's temporarily miserable, they're doing it because they get some enjoyment out of it. Just like when I sit down for three years and work on a book, I actually get enjoyment out of it day to day. It's not that I'm waiting to be published. I'm not waiting for the book to come out, because that's too far in the future. The actual day to day process gives me pleasure. So you have to find what it is that gives you pleasure that lets you pursue your goals. And that will give you motivation to do it. Trying to force it just doesn't happen. Stories are incredibly important to me. I have a ton of stories I want to tell, and I'm aware that I'm going to die someday. We call it a deadline for a reason. I also put food on the table by writing. So the combination of knowing my life is limited and wanting to eat gives me enormous, oh, and the fact that I love stories. So I have the carrot and the stick, which means I am a workaholic. So I hope that answers your question. Ultimately, you have to find the answers in yourself. I can't give them to you, but if you do find them, you will be unstoppable.* [4]

**Editing / Technical Writing**

> **I'm editing a book right now. What advice do you have for editors?**  
> *I suppose it depends what sort of problems you're encountering in the manuscript. If there are story problems, those have to be addressed before any sort of line editing. Assuming the story is sound and the characters are sound, then I would say pacing and then just the line by line work of chasing beautiful prose. And then of course you have to understand that when you suggest a change, it is just that, a suggestion. And hopefully, the author will look at some of those suggestions and say, ""you're right, there's an issue, but I can fix it this way."" And it ends up being a better solution because hopefully, they understand the material better than anyone else and thus can provide a new solution. I think the main thing is, and this is what I've been very fortunate with my editor, is that even when she's had to tell me that large sections of a book aren't working and need to be rewritten, she finds a way to do it in a non-personal way, in a very kind way, so that I never feel as if I'm being personally attacked. There's a separation between who I am and my worth and quality as a person, versus the worth and quality of the work. That's a very helpful distinction for the ego. So I never feel like ""I wrote something that doesn't work. I'm a bad person."" or I'm being attacked personally for it. Instead, it's like, ""oh, all right, it needs to be fixed."" There's work to be done. But it's not personal. And that is a hard thing to do. I've had to work on that myself. But if you can help your dear author in that way, that will help guide them in the direction they need to go. Hope that's of some use. Also if you do a prepositional phrase or a comma'd-out phrase after a conjunction and it's already going to be a comma, you don't need the comma after the and. Technically you use the comma, but you don't really need it, so I usually omit it. So if you do: ""I went to the store, bought a box of cereal, and on the floor I saw an ant."" You technically could comma-out the ""and"". You could go ""..., and, on the floor,"". That's just too much. The funny thing with commas is if you go back and look at earlier fiction, like Robinson Crusoe, or even Jane Austen, they comma'd by feel. So if they felt a pause in the sentence, they just put a comma there. And in some ways it's more naturalistic. Like, Robinson Crusoe, there are so many commas in that, but you get used to it and your brain goes right over it, and you don't even see it anymore. And then of course you have Cormac McCarthy who says, ""Commas? What's a comma? I use periods.""* [6]

**Switching POVs**

> *Personally, I dislike stories that ruin suspense by cutting away from the main character too much. My classic example of this is if you've ever seen the original Bourne films, the first Jason Bourne film is so much more interesting if they don't show you anything of the CIA. If you're just watching Jason Bourne trying to figure out who he is and what's going on, it becomes a much more interesting film than if you're seeing the POVs, the perspectives outside of his.* [1]

**Fantasy Species**

> *I don't like to say a different race. In fantasy we often say, well, we have different races. We have elves and dwarves. I think that papers over the fact that we really are talking about different species.* [1]

# Writing and promoting the books

**Initial idea**

> **When you were writing Eragon, did you create the world first or did you start writing the story first?**  
> *Story always comes to me first because the world is there to support the story. To be fair I didn't have all the story, all I had was the idea of a young man finding a dragon egg, and then I started building out what consequences of that would be and what type of story it was going to be and who else will be looking for the dragon egg? And of course, what sort of a world would dragons live in?* [5]

> *A young man who finds a dragon egg in a forest is not a story, but it's enough to get me interested.* [7]

**Emotion**

> **The part where Thorn yells ""At last!"" and then ""I thought you would never ask."" I was hitting my steering wheel and yelling in my truck because I was so happy and there was tears in my eyes. So what was that like as a writer? After all those hours on the less desirable part of the book, to then getting to write that scene. What's the emotion like as a writer for that?**  
> *The word is cathartic. If I'm not feeling what I'm writing, I'm doing something wrong. And it's hard because you read it faster than I write it. So however hard or happy, whatever it is you think it is when you're reading it, it takes me so much longer to write it. If I write a fight scene and let's say it's a ten page battle, which is a lot. Let's say it's a four page battle. That might take me a couple days to write. I might write it in an afternoon as well. Let's say I write it in an afternoon. You will probably read it inside of 15 minutes. So I live with it much, much longer. So by the time it does come in time for a cathartic moment, boy, is it a release. And I've talked with a lot of other authors about this. We find that getting to the midpoint of the book is really hard. It's a push. And once you get to a certain point, it starts feeling like a downhill slide to the end, because everything's gathering momentum. And then, of course, you get, as they call it, your crowning moments of awesome for your characters. And, yeah, it's a lot of fun. And then I sit there going, oh, I can't wait for people to read this. This is going to be awesome.* [4]

> **What scene emotionally affected you when writing it?**  
> *Brom's death. That hurt. When Eragon and Saphira see the curve of the earth? Anything to do with the burrow grubs. The end of Inheritance. The very last scene. The last few pages. Writing that, I didn't expect it to be difficult, I thought it might be but I didn't expect how hard it hit me. I literally was swearing and crying as I finished it. And then there's a lot of stuff in Murtagh that was just intense. I think in Murtagh, the one that got me the most, there's a flashback scene pretty late in the book regarding his mother. And yeah, that one hit hard. My feeling is that if I don't feel what I'm writing, you won't either. So I only try to write things that affect me.* [6]

> **Was there a scene in Murtagh that you had so much fun writing?**  
> *The stuff with the fork at the beginning was fun. There's a fishing scene in the book I really enjoyed writing. And the end, I really enjoyed the end. It wasn't joyful joy, it was meaningful joy, writing the ending sequence and events. I enjoyed a lot of that book for certain definitions of enjoyment.* [8]  
> *I love when he's underwater fighting Muckmaw and then when he went back down to look at the bones.* [5+]

> **What is your favorite relationship reveal in your series that you were most excited to show us?**  
> *There's one or two in Murtagh and some stuff in the deluxe edition material that I was quite excited for. In the second book, when Eragon realizes who he's fighting in the end, that was a lot of fun. When Oromis and Glaedr first show up in book two, that was fun. I was sitting there going, ""This is awesome! Hopefully you'll have the same reaction."" There's a couple of things coming up in the next few books that I have the same feeling for.* [5]

**Returning** 

> **Did you ever struggle with reconnecting with some of the elements of the world and the characters when you came back to the World of Eragon, and how did you work around it?**  
> *Getting to write The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm was a great reintroduction to the world. And then coming back to Murtagh a few years later, it was very easy to slip into it. And I think that's because I worked on the Inheritance Cycle from the age of 15 to 27. Those are really formative years, and I was literally doing nothing, but either working on or talking about or thinking about the series that entire time. So I'm pretty sure it rewired my brain. I'm not exaggerating. It really did. Just like if I'd been practicing piano that whole time, or doing gymnastics or something, it rewired how I think about things. So as a result, it's very easy for me to reactivate those old circuits and get back into it. The biggest difference was, A, I'm older, so I had more to bring to what I think, and B, Murtagh is a different character than Eragon and his relationship with Thorn is different than Eragon's relationship with Saphira. Nailing that down, getting it just right was very important, and that did take a little bit of work. The biggest thing though was just that after 20 years you get hazy on details. So trying to make sure that I didn't forget some things that I really shouldn't forget, that's where my assistants were very helpful.* [6]

**Touring**

> *I have been doing these presentations in public, in various places, since I was 17. My grandmother lived in Dallas. And I have driven from Montana to Texas to Houston to Austin more than once. And I am never going to do it again. And I am well acquainted with the humidity here. There's a reason I still live in Montana. In this area, I actually said, you know what? I'm going to tell you the story about Houston. Does anyone know what the population of Houston is these days? Four million? Okay. Montana is the fourth largest state in the Union, and we have just around a million people in the entire state. So when my family and I self-published Eragon and I was going through schools, and libraries, and some book stores to promote the book, it meant a lot of driving. If you're from Texas, you know driving. But there just weren't that many people or schools to go to and it was hard. And so my dad and I ended up driving down here and I got invited to the library at Holland, and I cold-called some schools here in the Houston area, and in Katy as well. Man is the traffic bad in Katy. And I ended up having a whole bunch of schools that wanted me to do presentations in the Houston area. And I came down and apparently the librarians liked for me, and as some of you probably know, there's a really strong librarians organization here in the state, and so they all talked with each other, and before two or three days had passed, we had an entire new book tour already scheduled from all the other schools that wanted me to come and visit. And so I spent an entire month on the first trip, just doing two to three one-hour-long presentations in schools here in the Houston area. And then I ended up coming back. After Random House had bought the books, I got a special dispensation for them to keep selling self-published editions to meet the commitments I had here in the Texas/Houston area. So I did a bunch of stuff in the Houston, Katy, went down to Corpus Christi and even went out to Anahuac. The kids were awesome. It was an amazing, amazing experience. And it sort of burned into my brain walking into all of these schools. I went to one school down in Corpus Christi that was so poor, they turned off half the lights in the school to save money. This high school district was so poor, they cancelled football. Yeah. And those kids were some of the best behaved and most interesting kids I ever met on any of my tours. So all of which is to say, that's why I'm surprised a couple of self-published editions are popping up today because I've sold a lot of them around here. And that's a large part of why I was able to get Eragon off the ground back in the day. It's fun to be back and not stuck on freeway in Katy at 6 in the morning.* [5]




# About Christopher


**Christopher's Dragon (possessive)**

> **If you were in that universe, if you lived on the planet, what would your dragon look like?**  
> *Well, she'd probably be large and blue, named Saphira. Or Vervada. I do like Vervada. That is Saphira's mother's name.* [1]

**Christopher's Dragon (contraction)**

> **The dragons see the way you do. Is that your hint that you are also a dragon?**  
> *Am I also a dragon? Well, it depends how annoyed I am, then I might start breathing some fire.* [2]

**Favorites**

> **Who are your favorite characters to write about?**  
> *On the sci-fi side of things, Gregorovich. Delight to write. On the Eragon side of things, Saphira, of course, she's the reason I wrote the series. But Elva was just wonderfully creepy to write. And Nasuada was great. Angela was always fun to bop around with. But mostly Saphira, I think.* [2]

> **Who are your favorite species to write?**  
> *I've always loved the dwarves. I love their language, I love the way it sounds. I'm becoming increasingly fond of the Urgals as time goes on. And I want to do more with them as well. The elves are okay. It's like yes, they're beautiful, they're graceful, they're strong. You really don't really want to hang out with them though, so. They're judging you.* [2]

> **There have been many theories over the years, some pretty crazy, about what the Menoa tree took from Eragon. Do you have a favorite theory you have read?**  
> *I've heard some pretty crazy ones. Probably the craziest one isn't that the Menoa tree took anything from him, but that it impregnated him. Or another one was that it took an Eldunarí out of him, or Saphira's Eldunarí. All of which are kind of off the wall. Those are not the answers.* [1]

**Clothing**

> **Do you know what color your shirt is?**  
> *Purple. But I have a feeling it looks different to you than me. I did have my friend once tell me that I was brave to wear purple. I was like, ""Why?"" I don't know. It worked when I met my wife. So...* [2]

> **I have a question.**  
> *Is that a cape of a cloak?*  
> **It is a cloak.**  
> *Excellent. We should wear more cloaks these days. I was married in a cloak.* [4]

**Politics and Religion**

> **Are you a Christian?**  
> *I make a habit to never discuss politics or religion in public. So I respect your beliefs, I hope you respect my beliefs, and my belief is to not talk about it at the moment. Especially not around an election. No matter what I say, no one's going to like what I say.* [3]

> [paraphrased] We spent a little bit of time discussing his policy of not talking about politics and religion. He said that if he were to talk politics, he would have to ""win"", which wouldn’t be good for anyone. [3+]

**Guns**

> **What's the story behind you dodging gunfire?**  
> *I live in Montana. And every once in a while, people come to Montana from the cities, usually out of state, and they think they're in the middle of nowhere. And so they start target practicing without realizing the bullets keep going. And I will tell you, there's nothing that gets your adrenaline going or wakes you up quite as much as seeing puffs of dirt around your feet as bullets are hitting the ground or hearing bullets or shotgun slugs going over your head, or seeing the holes in the side of your house where the bullets hit. This happened three times. I'll happily admit I've never been in combat, and never had anyone trying to shoot me directly. But honestly, it doesn't really matter when you're actually seeing the bullets skipping off the ground around you. So intentional or not, it was pretty dicey. It was pretty dicey.* [2]

> [paraphrased]  I asked him if he was a hunter or not, and he smiled and was like I typically don’t talk about that but here one sec, pulls out his phone and starts showing me pics of him elk hunting. [1+]

**Fatherhood**

> **How has becoming a father influenced your writing?**  
> *It's made me more focused because there's less wiggle room in life right now. And I don't have extra time or energy. And although I've always had people who depended on me, it's a lot different when there's a kid that wakes up at three in the morning crying, and if you don't feed them, they might die. And your feelings and your need for sleep don't matter in that moment. You really have to be selfless in the way you weren't before. So it's interesting, because I've heard other authors talk about how becoming a parent, changed their attitudes toward violence, for example, and things like that. And it really hasn't for me. If anything, it's solidified my views that if you are going to defend your family, if you need to, or if you need to do things, you cannot afford to hesitate because the cost of failure is too high. There's an old saying that the child is the parent of the father or mother, in the sense that they make you an adult in a way you weren't before. And it's true. It's true.* [2]

> *I don't want [the Eragon show] to be Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon. I actually, I can't watch those shows. It goes too far for me. Part of that is when I tried to watch House of the Dragon, the first episode, my wife had given birth three days before. We started heading into that scene and I just said, ""you know, we really don't need to watch this."" My wife was like, ""no, we really don't.""* [2]

> **Would you ever have characters inspired by my kids?**  
> *Possibly, I mean, they're still kind of in the larval stage. As they are growing, feeding, pooping, they're becoming more and more their own selves, which is a delight to watch. I grew up in the public eye in many ways, and so I am very protective of their privacy. If they wish to be public, someday that can be their choice. But I have no immediate plans to base any characters on them, mostly because my characters are so much older than them. I saw somebody said, you know, when I say I sleep like a baby, people should really understand that means waking up at 3am screaming covered in my own urine. But being a parent is actually well worth it.* [8]

> **What are some of your favorite books to read to your kids? Eragon?**  
> *No, Eragon's too long. Grandfather Twilight, I really enjoyed that one. Peter in Blueberry Land. She was like Swedish. She did a whole line of books. [Elsa Beskow]. Love those books. They're a little older. Beatrix Potter, a lot of the classics. Dragons Love Tacos is a favorite of my son. Look, dragons do not love tacos. I'm sorry. They like the meat. They're obligate carnivores. They're not eating tortillas.* [8]

**Minecraft**

> *We're all very good at practicing the things we want to do. The problem is sometimes what we get really good at doing are things that aren't maybe the best at progressing toward the goals we claim we actually want. I'm very good at playing Minecraft. If you go to my YouTube channel, you can find a video of the storage system I built. It's automated. It uses shulker boxes. It sorts every item in the game, including the unstackables. It's gigantic.* [4] *Probably cost me a novel.* [6] *I also built a machine that kills the Ender Dragon with one arrow. That was fun. I built a machine that auto-kills the Wither. I got tired of being attacked in Minecraft, so I put a mob switch that turned off all the hostile mobs. I'm not going to go through all the machines I built. Anyway, I don't play Minecraft anymore. Writing and telling stories, taking care of myself physically, spending time with my family, getting to do some art on occasion. These are the important things for me in life. And I attempt to put every moment of every waking hour toward those goals.* [4]

**Puzzles**

> *I love three-dimensional puzzles, like interlocking wood puzzles. My parents got me at one time this interlocking wood puzzle, it looks like two pyramid stuck base-to-base and it's like 51 pieces. I would take it apart and put it together blindfolded when I was a kid or a teenager.* [7]

**Genies**

> *When I was a teenager I've probably spent more than a few days daydreaming about how to word a wish to a genie. Here's what you do. You tell the genie that when you say you want something, and of course you have to make this very complicated, but it will happen the way you wish it intended to happen, and then you say you want an infinite number of wishes. The genie probably wouldn't like that, but alternatively you can say either give me all the wishes I want or I wish genies don't exist.* [6]


**Collection**

> *We've got a couple of thousand books in the house. A lot of them are editions of Eragon, but still.* [6]",1,1731420105.0,Eragon,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I exercise regularly, and not a single person in my family has diabetes. It’s been about 2 years of not knowing what’s going on. My job requires me to do an annual physical, and in 2022 they told me my A1C was high at 5.9. I was confused, but made the necessary changes. Only drinking water and occasionally coffee, cutting out white breads/pastas/rice/potatoes. Watching my carb and sugar intake, doing all the research into glycemic indexes, etc etc. One year later, in 2023, I went to my physical and they said my A1C was up to 7 (based on a blood sample they had taken two months prior). I was devastated and confused and frustrated beyond belief. I got an at home kit and tested it myself and got 5.7. I started monitoring my sugar levels daily, noticing a morning level of 110-120. When I gave into my cravings and ate things I knew were bad for me, I’d see it go up to 250 at the highest. For the most part it stayed around 180 after meals and went back down relatively steadily. A got an appointment with my pcp a few months later, who said my A1C was 6.5. She diagnosed me as type 2 and put me on 2,500mg metformin daily. For about three months I was horribly sick, my sugar levels crashed to the 60s on a regular basis, and I just wanted to die. I went back 3 months later for a new doctor to tell me my A1C was 5.5 and that the previous doctor misdiagnosed me. She told me to stop taking metformin but to continue my diet and exercise routine. My physical this year came around, A1C was back to 6.4. Tested it myself again (since they do the blood draws months before the actual physical) and I got 5.9. Went to my pcp, it was 6.6. She referred me to an endo with concerns for LADA. My appointment is in two weeks, and just last night I saw my sugar get the highest I’ve ever seen at 366 after eating pasta. To be fair, I knew I shouldn’t have had pasta, but it was date night. Anyways, I’ve been really struggling with accepting this new life and these new worries. I’m trying to be mentally prepared for a diabetes diagnosis but I can’t get past the “why me” mindset. I tried my whole adult life to eat decently and exercise and care for myself. Now I cry every time I eat a cookie or a bite of my husband’s dessert because I feel disgusted with myself.",1,1731419021.0,ladadiabetes,0,1.0,False

Last week I was offering to listen to founders and company owners for half an hour and try to give them some pointers in regards to marketing. It might not seem like much, but sometimes it requires only an unbiased perspective and someone with a fresh set of eyes to look over the website, product, promotional activities, to find something which can lead to large improvements.  
  
To be frank it was a great experience, met quite a few people from different verticals in different business lifecycle stages.  
  
Before the sabbatical I have spent 15 years in early and earliest stage startups, with 2 stints in corporate of around 2 years each.

2. I've been using fasting salts. Based on past experience I'm doing small amounts with lots of water to avoid diarrhea. If I don't reach the recommended amount of fasting salts does that really matter? It recommends between 2 and 4 scoops a day, but considering the amount of water I've been drinking with it, I think it's unlikely I'd reach that level.

Honestly if I don't consciously make the effort to drink more, I'd probably end up just drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea and or coffee a day. Based on past experience. I'm guessing that wouldn't be enough fluid intake.",2,1731418953.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

This happened after he told me my own boyfriend had cheated on me. We were out at a party with a group of friends, and Sam was acting strangely all night. Eventually, he pulled me aside and said he needed to talk to me in private.

Sam began by telling me that my boyfriend had hooked up with another girl after his graduation party. My boyfriend had previously explained that he was with this girl that night because she was upset and drinking heavily. He’d told me he helped her into an Uber after she asked him to come over for coffee, but he’d declined and gone home instead. But according to Sam, my boyfriend went to her apartment and had sex with her. Then, Sam added that his own girlfriend had cheated on him with her ex. He suggested that we get back at them by sleeping together.

Sam told me he had more details to share, but only if we went back to his apartment. Foolishly, I agreed to leave the party with him. I didn’t want anything to happen between us, but every time I tried to leave, he’d reveal more “information.” I was in shock and wasn’t looking for revenge, but after hours of listening to him, I eventually gave in. I let him kiss me, and one thing led to another until we slept together.

The next day, I met his girlfriend—who he’d claimed was his ex. She encouraged me to confront my boyfriend, so I did. But when I checked the details, everything my boyfriend had told me lined up perfectly. The messages, the Opal card tap times—everything matched. That’s when it hit me: I had made a terrible mistake by not talking to my boyfriend first. I was devastated.

That night, I confessed to my boyfriend, and he immediately called Sam to confront him. Sam denied everything, telling his girlfriend that I was making it up. He’d covered his tracks well; he had no messages or calls from me, as he’d told me to delete them—and I did, not realizing he was manipulating me.

Now, Sam’s girlfriend and I aren’t on speaking terms. Recently, she reached out, saying she was pregnant with Sam’s child, and she asked me again if I had slept with him. She didn’t believe me because Sam had manipulated her too.

My boyfriend forgave me after I apologized profusely, but things are still rough. He says he doesn’t fully trust me, and sometimes he treats me poorly, which I accept as something I deserve. He took me back after I cheated, and I know rebuilding trust will take time.",2,1731418765.0,TwoHotTakes,5,1.0,False

“It’s out there,” the strange man pointed to the sky.

*Lonesome Henry,* Edwin Tanker chuckled. That’s what his friends were calling this guy. They warned him this wacko was hanging around, spouting bizarre ideas about life.

 Ed was walking to exercise his leg after knee surgery. He had some time to blow. “Really,” [The young man put his leg on the park bench where the man sat. He stretched. ]()“What’s out there?”

“Love… Love is out there my friend.”

The man’s reply was… unexpected.

Ed couldn’t decide if the guy sounded crazy or rational. Was this some sad, pathetic broken man, or a forlorn, forgotten scholar? He knew there was a fine line between insanity and genius.

“Hmm, okay,” The idea made Ed smile. Maybe Lonesome Henry had some answers. Yeah, he could use some clues about love… His heart had been broken far too many times.

   Love, like everything else in the world, is sold by the media, marketed as a concept, offering happiness, and joy. Romance movies and novels play out love as life’s greatest gift… And yeah… he had to admit… maybe it is.

   He certainly had not planned to start a conversation with this pitiable, tragic creature, but he was curious. What was this man seeing?

“We all know love is out there,” Ed said. “But how do we capture it...? How do we make it real for the world to see?”

Expectations formed as Ed finished his question. Henry was going to tell him $20 would make love real…  a donation to help him buy food or drugs… that was this guy’s idea of love… But Ed was wrong.

“Love,” the man pulled on his scraggly beard. “Its energy is everywhere, hidden in hearts and souls… It could power the world, end poverty, make weak men strong, and save the planet from its illusions.”

“Ya know…” he went on. “It’s more prevalent than the billions of neutrinos passing through our body every second… Like dark energy it dominates the universe… But people can’t see it… They ignore it… Love remains hidden… hidden behand the dream of reality.”

“What?” Ed staired at the man. He realized this guy wasn’t that old, maybe thirty-five or forty. With a shower and a shave Lonesome Henry might even look… human.

“That’s…” Ed didn’t know what to say. “That’s nice.”

“Ahh,” he tried again, debating, if he should just nod and walk away… He considered returning to his first instinct and offer the man money. That’s likely all he really wanted anyways. But Ed had questions … and he had time. “Do you want to get a cup of coffee or something?”

No one could have been more surprised than Ed was asking him this. Really? What the hell was he thinking?

Somehow, they ended up at Dad’s Diner. Again, Ed studied this strange soul. He didn’t know what it was, The man’s deep blue eyes held an unknown, esoteric look like he had seen real truth, beyond reality, and found love unveiled in its purest form. The idea made Ed laugh. Yeah, his imagination got carried away at times. But Ed did like to dream of hope… And he always hoped to find some profound revelations about life.

“So,” Ed began. “They call you Henry… Is that your real name?”

“Hank,” he smiled. “This is very kind of you… I do like to talk,” the man admitted. “I like to share my thoughts… my soul when people listen.”

Hank chuckled. “I guess most people think I’m kinda crazy.”

“It’s a pleasure, Hank,” Ed was still unsure how to deal with this guy. What had he gotten himself into? He couldn’t figure out why this bizarre figure seemed so compelling. “Did you want some breakfast.”

“No thank you… Coffee is fine.”

Hmm, another surprise. Who was this guy?

“So, Hank… I guess you’re not presently working.

“Ha,” he released another chuckle. “I suppose you’re taking about working for monetary gain… No, I’m not doing that… I am working though… harder than you can even imagine… It’s just on a more subtle, transitory level.”

Again, he laughed. “Yeah, I know that sounds weird… But I do seem to find projects which engage me.”

“Really? What kind of projects?

“Well,” his look was penetrating. “Today, my project is you.”

 

  “Me,” Ed laughed. “I’m not somebody’s project.”

“Ed Tanker,” Hank said. “Twenty-five years old, working as a sports therapist. After blowing out your knee in a high school football game you became interested in sports medicine and graduated early, landing a job at H & L Medical Associates. Your knee went out again three weeks ago playing basketball. Last Thursday you had surgery replacing your kneecap… You’re doing remarkably well… by the way.”

Ed was stunned. Who was this guy? “What the…?”

“Relax, Ed,” he held up his phone with a chuckle. “I’m not some kind of stalker… Really… It’s all here in your records.”

His I-Phone showed a picture of Ed with a Wikipedia-like report. “I like to make sure I’m not going for coffee with a lunatic. You should really do the same.” His smile was disarming. “Although, I’m kinda off the grid… You likely won’t find too much info about me,”

“Well then, tell me about you.” Ed knew he sounded irritated, but this guy was suggesting he was some kind of project. Yeah, it was disturbing.

“I’m sorry,” he sipped his coffee. “I guess, I caught you off guard.”

Ed gave him a hard look. He nodded, his sparkling blue eyes unwavering, filled with humor.

 “So,” Hank began. “I know they call me Lonesome Henry… Well, it’s not because I’m lonely… not me… It’s my people… I kinda have a way of finding lonely people… and curing them.”

“Curing them?” Ed’s stare softened. Curiosity taking over. “Loneliness is not some kind of disease,” his tone was flat, unemotional.

“Sure, it is,” Hank never hesitated. Despite looking like a bum, he was remarkably self-assured. “Loneliness is probably the most proliferate disease on the planet. Everyone’s lonely… We’re all isolated souls… Connection with community, friends, and even lovers is a superficial remedy at best. We’re trapped inside our-Selves… And sharing Self is terribly difficult in this crazy social environment. People want to fit in, but they’re all so distinctly unique… So, finding Love is… well… it’s challenging.”

“Are you kidding me,” Ed didn’t know what to make of this guy. “So, what the hell… You’re like Dr. Love or something?” His sarcasm was obvious.

“OMG,” hank put a napkin to his lips. “That’s funny… No, no, no… I guess I see myself as more of a personal guide.”

“I didn’t ask for any kind of personal guide.” Ed’s annoyance was showing.

“You didn’t,” Hank seemed surprised. “You said you know love is out there… you asked me, how do we capture it… how do we make it real?”

“Eh,” Ed paused. Did this guy have answers? “I- ah, I suppose I did…”

“I’m sorry,” The man tilted his head, confused by Ed’s response. “I forget people are caught up in this reality syndrome thing… facing emotional soul truth can be… unsettling.”

“What? What are you talking about?”

“Why… Love, of course,” he answered. “Consider how it’s presented… and how it plays out…”

Ed’s mind drifted… So many things… Everything… is based on the concept of love… Pop music is all based on seeking love, losing love, or simply wanting to find love. Yet in reality… can the hope of love ever reach the levels of expectation presented in these dreams… or is the idea of falling in love only a fanciful illusion?

 “Fulfillment of love in life is perhaps the most longed for gift on the planet,” Hank’s words fell into Ed’s ponderings.

“No one wants to be lonely. At a young age, we’re not aware of the difficulty involved with the intimate details of uniting souls. We experience the heartbreak and emotional pain involved. Yet, we become aware of sex and the pleasure that can bring.”

Ed was well aware, sex too, was a marketed concept. Sold as offering happiness and incredible pleasure… Once again, this idea is based on truth… and once again… all that was involved with it had to be experienced to know the hidden suffering it can bring.

“The full impression of love and relationships are rarely considered when we are young, “Hank continued. “But we soon find love-seeking liaisons are like a superhero movie… with great pleasure comes great pain and hurt. It takes the strength of [two souls committed ]()to each other to make love work.

“Love and marriage often fail,” he said simply. “Combining mind and soul with one another is a challenge. It’s difficult, even when we are aware… that making love work provides happiness and satisfaction… We still find it still requires pain and suffering.”

“More coffee,” the waitress leaning over the table brought Ed back to Dad’s Diner,

“Ah, yes, please,” he slid his cup up to accommodate her. “Where are you from Hank?”

 

  Where had he come from? He thought back…

There was nothing. Hank was aware… but there was nothing. Nothing to describe… Nothing to see… There were no sounds, no children playing… There were no aromas in the air… There was no air, no wind. Nothing changed… because nothing… is all there was…

 How do you explain nothingness? How do you communicate or illustrate nothing? Nothing is emptiness. Henry tried to recall… but even emptiness is something. A void may be a hollow, baren space… but subatomic particles still danced in a vacuum.

 Meaningless awareness… aimless… pointless… purposeless emptiness… vast and overwhelming… nothingness…  It was all that existed… this was all of everything. to Hank… There was nothing else.

Feeling… he recalled no feeling… that was the worst of it… there was no feeling.

 It was emotion which first generated being. Awareness… was ignited by feeling. He wasn’t sure if it began with loneliness or with hope. It was feeling though… It began with feeling… Motion began with emotion. Was it loneliness or hope? Both were undefined.

Consciousness was an abstract artifact, unformed and uninformed. Self was a presence; the stirring of emotion making him aware. He was… that was all.

   He remained asleep for thousands, no millions… perhaps billions of years… It didn’t matter in endless space/time… there was no one to care.

  Was there magic in the beginning? Was there some powerful extract seeping from the Creator? A touch of inspiration… longing began to manifest.

And then… he sensed her… It was perhaps his first real memory. It was the only thing he truly recalled. The prior emptiness did not really exist… How could it? It was nothing… Hank laughed at the memory.

She was there… that was all he knew… She was there… undefined but present. And he was drawn to her.

 The swirl of feelings began. Confusion was one of his early impressions… What was this? What was happening? He could not as yet, define desire… but it was compelling.

 Hank vaguely remembered laughing, or at least something like laughter. There was mirth, joy… purpose.

  The process of finding her, uniting with her, was God inspiring awareness. Hank was discovering who she was… who he was… Or perhaps… he was becoming… becoming Self, becoming Self-aware. Emotions ignited, flaring off in a thousand different directions. Hank chuckled, there was no direction… until he fell… in love with her.

  He supposed it should be noted, if he were to document this, the concept of gender was not yet a thing. Personhood, and humanity had not been conceived… No, there was only emotion, and it was glorious… a place later described as heaven, or at least as far as human words might describe it.

Yeah, Hank now knew… consciousness, awareness… Love had sparked the realization of being… it all began with Love.

But anyone can tell you… it’s only during hard times that we become truly aware of our Selves… our independent thoughts and feelings. It’s only during hardship and pain that we discover Self.

  Hank experienced a moment next to eternity in love with his partner. But she too needed to discover Self. With his concept of God and the eternal Maker… he was proud of her and the reality she formed. Still, there were children here now.

The sad concept of loneliness, once the only thing he knew, sprinkled outward. Hank could not recapture or contain it. It was released. So, he reached out. a guardian of love… a healer of emptiness.

At first… he believed containing the disease would be easy. Who would not choose love over emptiness? But loneliness, hope and confusion were the first impressions of being. Self and individualism were inherent properties.  Hank underestimated the power of the individual essence of spirit. He misjudged pride, the personal smugness of dignity and self-esteem. It seemed souls needed a distinct awareness of individuality.

The need to share love required a kind of duplicity. Prerequisites had to be met. The initial necessity of identifying the unique distinctive personality of Self was required for true love awareness to manifest.

Love was muted by reality if such prior precautions were not fulfilled.  The indulgence of uniting with another soul completely in love needed to be inexplicably bond… Yet a subjective awareness of an autonomous personal Self had to be maintained.

Hank underestimated this process. Finding and understanding love relationships as a human creature were challenging. Identify Self… recognize soul… discovering the niche and the place where relationship fits… Determining balance… measuring and affording mutual affection… binding it beyond the fallibility of nature and humanity… Then working and praying that its authenticity can be maintained as time will either cultivate or corrode all the hopes and ideals contained in its essence.

Lasting love is not always dependent on choice, but on tolerance, understanding, perseverance, and forgiveness.

However, within the past year I’ve twice had post from Singapore be returned or lost.

Earlier in the year a friend of mine tried to send a package which only contained paper, some decorative tape and some candy. After a few weeks with no word on my end, it was returned to them with an An Post stamp on it, confirming that it had at least made it to Ireland. They tried sending it again with the candy removed, and it worked fine from there. I got the package in the end.

This time, the package (containing art and a packet of instant coffee) seems to have ended up in the void. It was shipped on the 29th of August and neither of us have received any word since. My only hope at this point is that it gets returned to them, because it doesn’t look like it’s showing up here any time soon.

I’d never had this issue before, and my friend has only ever experienced this with packages to Ireland.

I have no idea why right now on this day I have the urge to share it, but hey, here goes.

I will preface this to say I have my own beliefs and experiences when it comes to spirtiuality & the existence of things other than ""just human"". That said, though I firmly do believe there is life on other planets and that earth has its fare share of visits and influences - it is not something I actively pursue to find or reach out to? I am not sure how to explain it but I hope that gives some insight into where I am coming from, and forgive me for the gaps those more experienced in this area may have. 

Back to the story -  
It was super early in the morning, in the town of Worcester, South Africa. It was dark out and I had just finished setting up some technical equipment for an event taking place that day. It was Winter, and particularly chilly this morning but no cloud in sight. I have always loved the evening sky and I was busy chatting to a colleague over a cup of coffee outside during a smoke break.

I was looking up for a long time, then back at my colleague talking about whatever, when movement caught my eye. There was a row of lights moving in the night sky - first from a far but getting closer quite fast - not zapping fast, but fast for what I assumed must be a laaarge plane. The best I can explain it, imagine a plane with all the lights on on the inside, passing very closely (I say close because the lights were getting bigger and my brain was trying to explain what I was seeing) like so close you were standing a few meters away from it on a runway - yet it was flying in the sky and somehow the body of the plane was not visible, yet the windows were. It was like it had an invisible cloak or was reflecting the night sky around it, yet the ""window shutters"" were open showing the lights on the inside of the plane? 

I actually zoned out and poked my colleague to look at what I was looking at. He is what I would say a very intelligent and rational man, and both of us were looking at these ""plane windows"", in a neat row, moving towards and past us in the night sky, with no actual plane body and seemed to be VERY CLOSE to us and had to be huge but...there was nothing? If an actual plane was that close to justify the size of the ""plane's windows"" we were seeing...It must be about to crash not far from us.  
Yet, there was absolutely no sound. 

Just these lights from the inside of a giant invisible plane passing silently. 

He did take a photo with his phone, I left my phone inside the building as I actually don't like walking around with a phone. But the picture on his phone wouldn't make sense for anyone who wasn't there and doesn't quite show what we saw. I am thinking of asking him but we don't really converse casually so no idea how to start that conversation LOL. 

Has anyone seen something similar to this? Or can point me to some reading material others have that sound similar?

This is the only event in my life so far where I have seen something I cannot easily explain in the night sky, with the added bonus of a witness lol.",1,1731417957.0,HighStrangeness,4,0.67,False

1gpk9lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1gpk9lb/i_regret_inviting_my_crush_over_to_visit_me_i/,I regret inviting my crush over to visit me. I regret acting the way I did. ,"I’m starting to hate myself for this. I invited my crush over to visit me so we could talk and speaks about each others lives and what we’ve been doing and she is friends with my brother and actually promised to visit someday in the future back when we met her by chance in public lol. 

I asked her for Sunday. She said yes. She tells me she needed to cover a work shift that day and acted super embarrassed that she couldn’t come. Proposed to come over later that day. I told her that it’s better not to if she felt very tired. I said I’d understand anyways. Veteran’s day she’s free. Asks me if I am too. I tell her I won’t until 6pm after finishing my new job entry training shift. 

6pm rolls around. And from 6pm to 8:16 ish pm I called her like 6 times and left her 2 voice notes asking if she’s going to come. I MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERBOARD FOR THIS AND I HATE MYSELF FOR IT UGHHHHH. I wasn’t mad at her. I am not angry at her. I wish she could just have told me no instead of leaving me waiting. I told her that we could be alone and she didn’t decline the invitation. My intentions were not to have her do anything she didn’t want btw. I don’t want to make her anything she’s not comfortable with. I decided to archive our chats bc I was too embarrassed with myself for the way I acted. I even called her sister to ask if she was ok or if anything had happened to her. I was worried, concerned even. 

I waited long amounts of time but time felt that it had passed so slow. I spent 3 hours recording karaoke songs, playing Minecraft, reading books, writing in my diary and even drinking the coffee that I had prepared for her. I don’t know why I bothered to speak to her in the first place. I let my social anxiety to get the best of me and I might have made myself look like an obsessed/intense person. 

I want to apologize even though I know it’s not my fault. I want to be mad at her for stupidly leaving me disappointed instead of rejecting me. I was expecting too much I guess. She didn’t tell me yes or no, and I think I would have preferred she turned me down rather than leaving me waiting. I bet we’re both mutually embarrassed with each other most probably. But omg I woke with an awful feeling in my heart, like as if I had done things wrong in the first place. 

Luckily I was able to vent to my grandma over the phone and I told her how hurt I had felt that she disappointed me. That I had tried to become friends with people but always felt that I was the only one reaching out and putting in the effort to connect with people, never being the one contacted back unless it was every once in awhile. She comforted me and we spoke for an hour to put my mind at ease. I was grateful for both her, and also my mother, who listened to me after I had spoken to grandma.

I have decided to ignore my crush for the time being. I do not have the courage to speak to her anymore. If she wants to come over, good. She can speak with my brother, but I’m upset. Maybe more at myself than I am at her. I regret being so intense when I shouldn’t have been. ",3,1731416734.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1gpk9ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gpk9ao/how_can_i_get_back_her_interest/,How can I get back her interest?,"There is a lady who joined our company a couple of months ago. Since she was the only female in our office, everyone used to take care of her with respect, including me. To summarize, I noticed that she had an interest in me. I was not into this thing, however, I started dropping her to her home, and on the way, we used to go to cafes to have coffee together. She started opening up herself to me, like her past etc. However, every second day I used to ignore her because I was not ready for this thing, as she was from a completely different background - Eastern European, and I'm from South Asia.

Every time we went to a cafe, she used to show her intentions that she wanted to visit different places. Even though I understood it, I used to ignore what she was saying. Once I ignored her for a whole month in office, without any chit chat etc. But after a month, I started dropping her again. Last Wednesday was the last time I dropped her home. While sitting in the cafe, I realized that probably it was my last chance with her, and she had made up her mind. Again, I ignored her few signals, and then we went back to our homes. This was the first time she didn’t shake hands with me, even though I brought my hand in front of her.

The reality is that I always liked her because she was so kind and beautiful. I loved each and every moment I spent with her. And I realized it more when I lost her. Now she doesn’t reply to my messages; she ignores me in the office. I requested her if we could meet for 10 minutes only, and that I wanted to tell her something. She agreed; we went to a cafe. I opened up my heart and thoughts to her. I told her that I loved each and every moment I had spent with her and wanted to continue. She completely ignored me, as if we had nothing between us, and asked me if she had ever given me any message like this.

I am so sad; I am actually in pain. I have contacted her again one time, but she doesn’t reply back to my messages anymore. It’s just one time after that. Now I realized how much I like her, how much I miss her laugh, how precious she was to me. Is there anything I can do to get her back? I never wanted to lose her again.",1,1731416703.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Whenever I go to his workplace for coffee he asks me how I am and we try and have a decent conversation about work, promos, etc. One time he came to my work and asked me how a coffee was that he had made (he's a manager, not a barista) and then said he was glad because he made it.

\-------‐--------------- 

I didn't wake up this morning feeling like I want to die. S cuddled me and made me coffee before he had to leave to meet some of his friends. He asked if I wanted to come. I did not. Instead, I'm at his place, engulfed by his surroundings, awaiting his return. The house smells like him, which is vaguely comforting.

I drank my coffee, I called my parents, and I took a shower. I stared at myself in the steamed mirror as I started applying my serums and creams, things I used to care about a great deal about at some point. And out of nowhere, it began. The tears, and the incessant feeling of being done with everything. I stood in the bathroom for a while, staring at my reflection in the mirror, asking myself what's wrong. The truth is, nothing is wrong yet somehow everything is. And the tears refused to stop.

All things considered, my life is technically great. I have loving parents who've given me the world, a wonderful partner who wants to build a life with me, and caring friends who check up on me even when I fail to keep in touch. I live in a nice country, I'm financially comfortable, and I'm doing what I've wanted to all my life. Everything is good. Then what even is the problem? Do I just reek privilege when I talk about feeling hollow?

Somehow, everything feels fleeting and meaningless. Perhaps it's the nature of my job, and the endless vastness that contributes to this feeling. In the grand scheme of things, what does any of it really even matter? Or perhaps depression really is just this: ugly crying on the couch for no apparent reason, with a bowl of cereal while staring at the endlessly gray skies outside. There's no romanticized version of depression, there's also no ""fun"" version of it as I always like to joke. It's just ugly and soul-sucking, almost like having a monster lurking in your shadows, ready to attack at any given point of weakness.

What then, is the solution to it all? I am a scientist after all, and finding answers is part of my job. I certainly don't have all the answers yet, but on days when I can muster up the energy and with the support of loved ones, I test various hypotheses to see what might be it. In some sense, I think we're all just scientists, just trying to stay afloat in this impossibly small yet big world, worrying about such meaningless yet enormous problems, caring about nothing yet everything.

*Flight: ₱2,180* 
I used my Mabuhay Miles to book a flight to Siargao. Amount paid includes carry-on and check-in baggage, plus taxes and other charges. 

*Van transfer, ₱600*
The hostel arranged this for me. 

*Accommodation: ₱3,170, Hostel Bajala*
I cannot recommend this hostel enough. 

**Location**
It is a bit far from town but I didn’t mind the location since the hostel offers free bikes for guests, and it was fun to bike around Siargao. BUT, it gets really dark at night since there is no street lights so make sure you’re back at the hostel before 6pm. If you don’t want the bike option, tuktuk is available which costs ₱100 per trip to town during daylight, and ₱150 at night. 😅 The hostel is a beachfront property AND is also close to the Secret Beach. 

**Amenities**
I stayed in their female-only dormitory which has six beds and an ensuite toilet and bathroom. The hostel turns off the air-conditioning of the dormitories from 11am-4pm. They have an air-conditioned cinema/music room where you can stay in during this time. In my experience, this did not bother me at all since I spent all day naman outside. 

The hostel gives out free drink every night! Options are sodas, beer, and sparkling drinks. 

They also have a shared kitchen where you can cook/reheat your food. They provide for a set of utensils for the exclusive use of each guest as well. 

*Tours: ₱6,600, Colz Travel*
I availed of the Sohoton Tour and Land Tour. 

I suggest to skip the Sohoton Tour during off-season. I availed the tour because I wanted to swim with the jellies but was only able to see 1 jellyfish. Travel time to Socorro was 2 hours, 4 hours for the whole trip. We only stayed in Socorro for 2 hours. 

(ps: it was provided that go pro and insta360 is free of charge for the guests to use but colz said that these were not available; BUT the tour guide was in possession of these the whole time and were only used to take group pics of the guests by the end of the tour lol)

Firefly watching, ₱200
There were only two of us who went to watch the fireflies. We both chickened out halfway through the tour because it was really dark and there were no other people around. Let me know if you need a contact for the activity, I can give you our contact. 

*Surf lesson ₱600, photo-ops ₱250, entrance to cloud 9 ₱100)
We went there around 5pm and it was lovely to surf during sunset hour! 

*Food ₱5,000*
Food in Siargao is a bit pricey especially if you are eating alone. One meal costs around 300 pesos. Thankfully I met some friends in the island with whom I shared a few meals with. 

Places I went to:
1. Cumin
2. Bebies BBQ
3. Halika Siargao
4. Cev
5. Smoking Joint
6. Siargao Beach Club
7. Yohi
8. Shaka Cafe
9. White Beard
10. Kermit Siargao
11. Little Roti 
12. Saint Thomas Coffee

It had not occurred to Alex that showing up in a rare classic ship, escorted by six alien ships would generate interest. But as it turns out, gliding up with four shuttles and two things that had been transports but were obviously for interdiction based on the racks of missile pods and very large point defense cannons that were taking up space where the cabin would normally go... That sort of thing turned a lot of heads.

He landed it like a champ, at least. Followed the landing protocols exactly. Rotated it at five kilometers, shut down the four inboard engines and used the remaining four to gently decelerate, gliding into the hanger bay in reverse. Anyone who wasn’t familiar with this style of ship would probably assume he was showboating, or getting ready to leave after a robbery. 

All it took from there was a handful of taps to the maneuvering thrusters bringing it to a stop, and gently easing the gravitics back to set them down right on the pad he was assigned. All that sim time had paid off.

Eleya let him open the hatch. It was his last chance to delete the intrusion package, but he was too far in at this point. The betrayal by the ONI was too big. He still considered himself a nobody, despite all the titles. Just some kid from the Arc who managed to get lucky a few times and land his dream job. If they’d do it to him, he assumed at this point, that they would do it to anybody.

A few moments after he cracked the exterior door, the ARGUS software that he was absolutely not aware of detected a public wireless signal and started up r_probe, which began trying to connect to that wireless network. Empire intel had figured out how it worked despite not having a proper wireless system, receiving signal with the threads that ran to his near-field connections, and resonating those same connections in concert to transmit. 

It was actually a very impressive feat of engineering. No indication it was possible until the system was actually in use.

Another thing that had not occurred to Alex was that all that interest would actually translate into people showing up. Part of that was things that made sense to him immediately: the station commander, a guy from Diplomatic Security Service, and a bunch of regular station security showed up to greet Eleya specifically and him as well because he was standing behind her. It was nice to be the pilot again. They barely even looked at him, just scanned his ONI badge. They got a very polite ‘please leave the guys in power armor here in the hanger, but do bring as many of your soft security as you need.’

The Royal Guard posted up at the stairwell into the ship and waited.

He was roughly aware of the existence of paparazzi until now. An annoyance for famous people. The observation window a floor above the entryway to the station proper was currently packed with people, and there were a lot of lenses pointed their way. Several of them were clearly focused on the GX, which he understood at a very visceral level. That had been him in the past.

The rest were interested in all the aliens and that guy that popped out of that weird old ship with them. He assumed none of them were ship-heads, the most unfortunate slang term Alex had been called by his brother for being a big spaceship nerd, and would not recognize a classic when it landed in front of them.

Alex kind of didn’t care for that level of attention. Maybe he should have dressed a little nicer. Unless they all just thought he was a pilot, like some kind of chauffeur. Came with the ship. Probably wouldn’t have an ONI badge, though, or continued into the station. Was nice to sail through customs, at least.

It was way more normal when they were in the station proper. Eleya’s personal security team had opted for clothing that was more traditional military - kept the gray tunics, pants, and what have you, but shed the combat hardware. He assumed there was loads of armor and shielding hiding in their clothes anyway. They were covering him right now as well, as they were all headed to the same place.

The corridors had been cordoned off, a bank of elevators reserved to take them up to the conference room. There was more security up here, starting with the Diplomatic teams in conspicuously bulky business suits at intersections, and eventually more Tsla’o mixed in that had come over with Carbon’s flight this morning.

They were a solid thirty minutes early when they arrived. A DSS suit and portions of that early contingent were already there. It was a very nice suite. Spacious, brightly lit, nice wide table to keep everyone from fighting with each other or something. A spread of snacks and beverages off in one corner, too.

All the Tsla’o inside snapped to attention when they stepped in, the handful that were sitting down jumping up immediately. Rigid spines, fist clutched to their sternum. The Empress dismissed this with a wave of her hand and they mostly went back to doing whatever they had been engaged with, though Colonel Lehnan made a beeline for them.

“Colonel. Updates have been coming in clear, I assume that you have not had any issues since the last?” She tipped her head at him.

He bowed in return. “No changes in readiness. After the initial perimeter setup approximately three hours ago, all scans and comms have remained clear.”

“Excellent. Thank you.” She gave him another nod and he returned to the armored laptop he had been sitting at when they arrived.

Eleya turned her attention back to Alex. “And how do you fare, young pilot?”

“It’s good to be back. I appreciate the hospitality, of course, but... There’s just something about the familiarity, you know?” Alex knew better than to assume they could have a private conversation here. No way. Not just what was being recorded by the ARGUS, but the room must have had recording facilities - both covert and overt - so he wasn’t about to start talking about what they were actually talking about. Maybe Eleya and all her Intelligence personnel were starting to rub off on him. A week ago he would have started talking about any damn thing without a second thought. 

His real reply to that question was him casually nodding along in the affirmative as he spoke. *Yes, the upload was underway.* While it was a very elegant system, it was not a very fast one. About two-thirds of the way done now.

She gave him a nod back, just as she had done to the Colonel. “I believe I do. While this space does not feel truly alien, it is... different. Little things pull at my senses. It seems to be a recurring theme today.”

“That is a very succinct way to put it.” It was, in his estimation. The biggest changes were the smells and the colors. They were not so technologically different that corridors on ships were unusually built, Human machines had fabricated parts for the *Sword* without issue. “The use of red on the support ribs always throws me off.”

“Is it so? It is a classic naval color for the Tsla’o.” She seemed actually interested in that.

“Yeah, we stick with very light grays, cream, off white... That sort of thing.” He gestured at the walls, a very generic off-white. Eggshell? Maybe. Sported that blue stripe most Navy ships had running everywhere. Though here it was at about shin height, making room for paintings of famous naval-related ships and events.

“This color, it is a bit... Macabre, is the phrase? Grim. Walls of bone. It does have a nice shade of blue.” She pointed out the stripe.

He hoped that the ONI was enjoying this conversation. “The stripe is supposed to be calming, for some reason. Never understood why. Doesn’t make me mad looking at it, at least.” Alex shrugged.

“Reminds me of the sea.” Eleya stared at it intently before looking to a dark painting of a old sailing ship in tumultuous waters. “Another thing our kind have in common.”

“Indeed.” Was it sea related? Who knows. Alex pondered the list of things he could talk about, as Eleya perused the paintings. Everything felt like it was a secret now. “So... Got any plans after the reception?”

“No.” She had moved on to a painting of an Aircraft Carrier. “Nothing aside from returning to my flagship.”

“Last time Carbon was on station, we were having dinner with an old friend - a mentor, really - that got cut short. It’d be nice to finish that. And if I come back on station without at least saying hello, he’ll kill me.” Alex found a smirk curling the corner of his mouth, paired with a faint chuckle.

She turned to look at him slowly, just a faint dusting of confusion on her face as she determined that was not literal. “Are you... Attempting to include me in this?” 

Was he? Sure seemed like it. “Yeah. I am. He’s a good fellow, I’m sure my mother would be up for it. If Carbon was having any problems with her I’m sure we would have heard about it by now. You can meet some of the people who have had a hand in shaping me.”

Eleya’s desire for normalcy surfaced in her eyes for a moment. Sitting down with family members without pretense, even ones who were pretending to just be doing outreach, was something she obviously missed. “Is there an appropriate dining facility here?”

“Oh, sure.” There had to be some kind of dining room for brass and dignitaries. He had only been to the commissaries and Noonan’s... and as much as he wanted to go back to Noonan’s, that was not a joint to take the Empress. Even if she probably would have wanted to go there. Alex did find himself amused by the idea of dragging her into the retro sci-fi pastiche of that tourist trap restaurant. “I assume. I’ll ask around.”

“Very well. If arrangements are made, I will go.” She turned to Alex and gave him a single nod, her word final. Her attention was quickly drawn away, leaning to the side with brows furrowed as she tried to make sense of what she was seeing behind him.

“Oh, well look at this motherfucker!” That was Sergeant Zenshen. Shouting in English. In the hallway.

Alex turned to look. Sergeant Zenshen was in fact standing in the hall, and he saw her standing toe-to-toe with someone who was clearly a Confed Marine, based on the green camo BDU’s and very close cut hair. Stana gave the Human woman a shove, arms tossed out to the side and glaring hard, daring her to take a swing. They were exchanging words that were very much something Eleya would love to learn about as the Human stalked back up into her face. “Oh shit hang on I’ll be right back.” He blurted that out as a single word as he hustled his ass to try to divert this impending disaster.

About halfway to the door he realized that the flow of cussing from both sides also included an extremely involved handshake, and that both of them were now grinning as they insulted each other in a more conversational tone. 

“Sergeant. Looking sharp, I must say.” The Marine spoke as she pulled Zenshen into a friendly hug, slapping her back carefully to avoid the antenna.

Zenshen had opted for the uniform update that he had suggested. She was part of his security detail, and could slot into Carbon’s if needed. She had recognized the name of the films he had dropped when making those recommendations as well, so her adoption of the charcoal three-piece suit was not surprising at all. 

She went with the black shirt and tie. Even had the silver collar bar. It did look sharp, which had been the point. Less military invasion, more individuals that you don’t want to mess with. Real Baba Yaga shit.

“The green suits you.” Stana was still smiling as she turned to Alex. “Mister Sorenson. This is the Marine I’ve told you about, Lieutenant Williams.”

“So it is.” Alex could tell that they were already familiar with each other now, at least. He bowed. Fuck. That’s not how you greet a fellow Human. “Nice to meet you, Lieutenant.”

“Likewise.” Williams smiled as well, dark skin crinkling around deep brown eyes as she extended a hand, not calling attention to his faux pas. “Alex Sorenson? I’ve heard a lot about you.”

He shook it, of course. It had been awhile since he’d physically interacted with another Human and that realization was actually more unsettling than having someone he’d never met already knowing about him. “Hah, really? All good things, I hope.”

“Good enough.” The Lieutenant sounded like she meant that as a compliment. “If you both will excuse me, I need to make sure everything is prepped before the Admirals arrive.”

Williams parted ways, leaving him standing there with the Sergeant. “How’s the uniform working out?”

“Base gear needs some work, got a lot of technology tucked away in here that is not as comfortable as it could be. They reworked a bunch of stuff because, you know, new threads mean new layout. Thermals are good, lots of pockets. The vest is growing on me. Visually? Badass. Humans love it. I’ve had to scoot more folks away because they wanted pics than because they were encroaching on the diplomat.” She was pretty pleased with that, fiddling with the top button on the waistcoat.

“Well, you wanted something less aggressive. Maybe we overshot a little bit.” If people were approaching the security teams specifically, that would present a very different problem than the one they were originally trying to solve. 

“It does seem so.” She shrugged. “I’m keeping this suit either way.”

“Williams was right, it does look sharp.” The *eetaleeahn* cut suit, from the waist up anyway, was actually very handsome even outside of the movies. It was growing on him.

“Thank you. Ah, speaking of the diplomat...” She nodded down the hall to Carbon, Amalu and Tenar in tow. Those two had opted for the white shirt and wore a refined version of their armored combat goggles over their eyes, a suite of sensors giving them more information about their surroundings than plain old flesh and blood could. It was still a good looking outfit.

Maybe he would consider a tie. If Carbon liked it.

Maybe.

“*Lan* Tshalen. Good to see you again.” He smiled pleasantly and gave her a little bow, fighting off the urge to greet her in a far less formal manner. They were keeping up appearances of just being something more like friends, after all. “I hope my mother wasn’t a bother?”

“As I expected, she was a delight. Very informative about the finer details of Human clothing, as well.” She grinned, bowing in return.

“Oh, well that’s good.” Why did that make him anxious? Was it the grin? Yeah, just a little too toothy for her not to be leaving some details out. It was also weird to be talking to her like this.

Man, he was not cut out for spy stuff.

“Indeed it is. I may require a trip to somewhere with a wider variety of stores in the future. I have been apprised of the fact that there are many fashion capitals on Earth.” She said, looking into the meeting suite and changing the subject. “I assume the Empress is here as well?”

Oh no, was she getting into fashion? Had she been into fashion before but he didn’t know anything about Tsla’o fashion so he had been completely oblivious to it? Shit. Neya would know. Neya would love it if she was. “Yeah, I left her in there when I thought Zenshen was out here picking a fight.”

Carbon turned back to him with a raised eyebrow, a hint of alarm in her voice. “Why would she be doing that?”

“She wasn’t. The Marine she had worked with is here too and... Human military personnel greeting each other can get a little out of hand. Clearly she picked that up.” He shrugged. Took all sorts to make a military run.

“Ah. Curious.” She put the eyebrow away and relaxed. “If you will pardon me, Pilot Sorenson, I should check in with the rest of the delegation.”

“Of course. See you inside.” He did the formal bowing thing again. She returned it and the security team followed her in.

He went to get a snack. Breakfast had been too damn long ago, and some mediocre food that he already knew sounded like it would hit the spot. The platter of Danishes left him with a strange sense of melancholy, perfectly baked and gleaming in the bright overhead lights. He missed *Human* stuff, and the flakey crust on the pastry he set on a little china plate taunted him. 

*Not going to be seeing the likes of me very much from now on, are you*?

Alex got a cup of coffee with a splash of cream and circled back around to the Confederation side of the table, his mere Intelligence Specialist rank leaving him at the end of the table next to Williams. In good company at least, according to the Sergeant. “Excuse me, Lieutenant... Have you heard if there’s a name for this operation yet? I’ve been a bit out of the loop so far.”

“As of this morning, it is being called Shadow Steppe.” While she did not roll her eyes at that, there was a certain tone in her voice that intimated it. “Like a prairie, not walking.”

He recalled the rolling hills and hundreds of acres of grasslands that had greeted them on the other side of the portal onto the artifact. That wasn’t obvious at all. “That feels a little on the nose. Like somebody got their thesaurus out and just sifted through words until something sounded kinda spooky.”

“Better than the first two I heard floated.” She finished that under her breath as she stood to salute the arrival of Admirals Argueta and Serrat.

Alex did not join her, being a civilian and all. He had no idea how his integration into an alien society would change that reaction, effectively being a dual citizen now. Probably would be the same, though. 

Neither Admiral seemed to mind, dismissing the Lieutenant and giving him a nod. Alex watched the two of them, in their crisp dress whites with a tasteful amount of ribbons and medals, approach Eleya.

Both of them bowed, about as deep as he would expect from one of the Empire’s own Admirals, though Serrat’s was deeper and more crisp. They could have gotten away with less, but had no doubt been coached to ensure they weren’t being insulting, particularly not on the first meeting. It was Argueta that spoke first. “Empress Tezhan. Thank you for coming here in person. It was a surprise to find that you wished to take a direct interest in this project, but we are pleased that you have.”

Eleya waited a beat, before she gave the Admirals a nod in return. “Given the importance of the task, it was clear that I should be personally involved. Particularly when one considers how our previous joint effort yielded such an unusual outcome.”

\*\*\*\*\*

There we go, back in stride. This changed a lot from where it had been, mostly pacing and rearranging things that had been in previous chapters. Also a little more character depth for both Alex and Eleya. He's starting to feel that isolation from his old species, and she really does want family back.

Also, I'm going to be real with you all... I don't remember if I've used Eleya's surname yet, or if I've changed it. So that's an original first draft name right there.

So actually not a barista here, just someone who makes their wife coffee every morning. I would love a few tips on how to make a design that isn’t just pouring the milk foam into the coffee. 

For some background, I used to make drawings with a little pen that dispensed powder (like cinnamon or other) but then the flavors of the powder became too overpowering. Then I tried a stamping method of sorts but it never quite came out correctly. Most recently, I’ve been putting the foam on the top of her coffee and then using a toothpick dipped in some espresso to draw a faint image. This most recent method is tedious and I’d love something that was a little darker.

Especially at the end. There was just a whole lot of nothing in between the first coffee date/scene. I just feel like there was sooo much they could have done that was a missed opportunity. 

I’ve seen a few comments saying that they are surprised because his romance should “write itself” which I agree with. Possessed by a demon, secretly soft and sweet, part of an organized crime family, the fact that he doesn’t want to open up at first etc. just the whole spite thing is spicy in itself. 

SO that being said, what did you think was going to happen with Lucanis romance storyline? And/or what did you WANT to happen? I’d love to hear other people’s ideas. Also I have started writing a fic because of all the ideas I have, so I may be also looking for more inspo if anyone is wanting to see a certain scene play out?! Is that allowed to ask on here lol 

Edit: one thing that I thought might happen or would have been cute is that Rook could have taken on the role of watching over Lucanis while he tries to get some sleep every night. There could be some really cute/spicy stuff with that. Maybe all the companions would rotate keeping watch, but spite takes a special liking to rook and causes the least amount of chaos when she is the babysitter.

# OCT. ~2024~CRITICAL MINERALS AND GREAT POWER COMPETITION

[Critical Minerals and Great Power Competition](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/critical_minerals.pdf)

***Great powers have always sought to organize the world in their interests, influencing production systems and value chains well beyond their individual borders. That is a large part of why colonial empires were built. Today, amid renewed global turbulence, division and competition between the great powers and their respective allies are increasingly influencing policy and action beyond the military-industrial sector, reaching into the wider economy. This politicizes supply chains, including those in clean energy, advanced technology and other strategic emerging industries. Securing the mineral inputs that are necessary for all these downstream applications has thus become a subject of growing attention by great powers. Understanding how they define and pursue mineral security is, therefore, essential for better understanding and anticipating key trends in commerce and international security. This report contributes to that wider understanding. In assessing critical and strategic mineral policies of China, the European Union, Russia and the United States, it covers both national and cross-national dynamics that go well beyond the minerals sector.***

***The authors—SIPRI’s Jiayi Zhou and André Månberger of Lund University—thus provide a timely, fact-based input to better unpack the drivers and implications of the increasingly securitized and even weaponized web of economic relations between great powers. Their work also illuminates how security policy is simultaneously expanding into new domains and returning to conceptualizations reminiscent of the cold war. As they highlight, discussion of mineral security must be global in scope, but is too often national in approach. With its broader approach and its close attention to the evidence, the report offers a foundation for dialogue on how to approach issues that are matters of both economic and security policy.***

Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division has put forward a new notional vision for a stealthy pilot-optional aerial refueling tanker. This comes as the U.S. Air Force is refining requirements for a future [Next Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS)](https://www.twz.com/air-force-says-it-needs-more-survivable-tankers-by-2040) ‘system of systems’ and amid serious concerns [about how the service expects to pay](https://www.yahoo.com/news/crisis-brewing-over-air-force-013824006.html) for that and other modernization priorities.

[Skunk Works](https://www.twz.com/21791/for-lockheed-martins-skunk-works-its-all-about-getting-to-the-prototype-stage) provided a rendering of its latest tanker concept refueling a pair of [F-35A Joint Strike Fighters](https://www.yahoo.com/news/f-35-deliveries-finally-cleared-192456919.html), seen at the top of this story and below, to *The War Zone*. A different view of this same conceptual design was first shown publicly at the [Airlift/Tanker Association’s](https://www.atalink.org/) (ATA) recently concluded annual symposium, [as reported by *Aviation Week*](https://aviationweek.com/defense/aircraft-propulsion/skunk-works-shows-new-optionally-crewed-tanker-concept).

*Coffee drip? Set or basta yung naka box na coffee drips in diff flavors
*Scented candles
*himalayan salt lamp. (I knoooow, very ninang sa kasal hahaha)

1gpjfau,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1gpjfau/job_searching_strategies_uk/,Job searching strategies [UK],"Hi,

I've been working at a small company for a few years after graduating, and have been trying to step onto a larger stage. I'm interested in product (sales/client service, think client portfolio manager-esque) roles at asset managers.

**I want to improve the efficacy of my job search. Can you provide feedback on my strategies and let me know if there are avenues I haven't explored?**

Over the last year, I've sent 150+ applications via career portals (I use linkedin/indeed to search), and have had three interviews. Each week I send out 2-3 applications for suitable roles.

Recruiters have reached out a handful of times, and one led to multiple rounds of interviews. However, when approaching recruiters myself I haven't got any responses to my outbound messages. 

Another strategy I've tried is 'cold messaging' on Linkedin. This led to going for coffee with three people who supervise the sorts of roles I'm interested in. However, it appears that in large orgs. the careers portal is the go to interface, and I've been pointed there when broaching my interest in their teams.

Is this a productive use of time? How can I do a better job of leveraging these meetings?

I've also recently become a charter holder and will start attending CFA UK events. Does anyone have any advice on how to attack industry events such as these?

Thanks,",1,1731413975.0,FinancialCareers,0,1.0,False
1gpjcrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/comments/1gpjcrx/spices_seasonings_and_recipe_cards/,"Spices, seasonings, and recipe cards...","I went through a cupboard today where I keep spices and seasoning, and realised that I had a bunch that expired over 3 years ago!

After clearing that out, I remembered that a chunk of them came from a meal delivery service that also sends out recipe cards (SimplyCook here in the UK, they send you spices/seasoning and the recipes, you buy the ingredients as appropriate so you're not surprised by expiration dates). So I went through those too—turns out I had a thick enough pile to be a really chunky edition of InStyle magazine. I found the 4 that I was interested in/had in date meal prep kits for, and the rest have gone in the recycling!

It's not a huge amount of improvement, but I have most of a shelf in a cupboard back—and found the manual for the coffee maker that I gave to my parents at the weekend as well.

1gpjadz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gpjadz/healed_after_1year/,Healed after 1year,"I was cured after one year. It all started when I occasionally felt the need to vomit after eating, along with pain in the upper middle of my chest. I didn't take it seriously and continued my normal routine until, one to two months later, I found that I couldn’t eat anything without feeling extremely nauseous. 



My problem was my daily diet, which mostly consisted of Dr Pepper,Pizza, Fast food made the mistake of not changing my eating habits and continued consuming whatever I wanted. I lost over 20 kg, going from 75 kg to 55 kg within a few months. 



Two months ago, I started eating only rice, potatoes, and eggs. I also stopped drinking coffee and soft drinks because I can’t walk straight due to the pain. Unfortunately, I often made the mistake of drinking coffee anyway, which delayed my recovery. 



Three weeks ago, I had my gastroscopy, and everything turned out fine. Now I’m back to full health and can eat and drink whatever I like. A few weeks ago i was very close to go  to the hospital because I was in so much pain that I could barely stand up straight. Healing clay and chamomile tea helped me significantly.



I am truly grateful for this experience. I was so afraid that something was seriously wrong, and now that I have recovered, it feels like I’ve been given a second chance at life.",6,1731413506.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False
