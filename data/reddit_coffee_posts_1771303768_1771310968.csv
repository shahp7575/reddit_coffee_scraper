My whole life I have been surrounded around strong minded, wise, and mature adults. I caught onto their humor and such so when I entered high school I felt very outcasted. I made one friend but I cut her off as she was not a good influence. I realized that it was not cool of me to abruptly cut her off but at the time I thought that was right. I wanted to have a friend who was on the same growth mindset and academic level as me.

Anyways, Highschool was hell I spent the rest of my time eating int he bathroom (super gross I know) or behind the school practicing introspection by journaling. Throughout that introspection I was able to learn a lot about myself and I wrote 4 killer essays that got me into a prestigious school.

I held no expectations going into college. My first semester I joined every club that interested me. Like EVERY interest. I had a light schedule so I attended all the meetings and I met a good handful of people When I find people I click with I can be loud and vise versa. The people I connected with were never freshman but upperclassman. I narrowed it down to a few clubs I really love and I routinely go to but I have yet to click with anyone.

I thought I finally had a friend when I met this one girl last semester. She was also an only child and we had fun at events. However recently things fell off and it looks like she's trying to connect with other people as she only has a year or so left. A person in my class last semester reached out to me. I was hesitant as they were already a part of a friend group so she was not desperate for friend like me. We had a brief hangout and it was fun but they never reached out again and I did run into after and it was pretty awkward? I'm ok with people feeling me out and not wanting to hang again I guess it's just disappointing.

My dorm is known out of all of the dorms to be a bit socially dead. I am also on an all girls floor and I would say nobody is close unless you lucked out with a good roommate. My roommate situation is a whole other story but a reason I feel bad especially today is both of the roommates I've lived with have always brought friends into their dorm and I guess I always get annoyed in the moment but I think I feel so negatively because I wish I could bring someone in to talk to.  I do enjoy my solitude and in college when everyone has busy schedules having no friends is not the worst thing but I really wish I had a friend. The closest I came to having a friend was my grandfather and we both liked jazz, to read, and learn about history.

Recently I invited one girl I seen around on my floor to get boba and that was nice but again she seems busy and she never asked to hangout again. In class I ran into someone I recognized in my dorm and started a conversation with them. We swapped socials but it never went through. (apologies for the millions of examples i'm just trying to show a girl is trying). Off track but I'm not always so harsh on myself because my generation is pretty screwed. I will be standing waiting for class and everybody is on their phones. No one is willing to talk to strangers or get to know anyone spontaneously.

Anyways  recently I ran into someone else familiar and asked if they wanted to grab a coffee and they said yes. So I am trying AGAIN. I just don't understand when I'm in the dining hall and walking on campus everyone has their group and I don't get how they all make friends with each other like that. I would find it draining to have someone stuck to my hip and I am sort of picky of how my friend should be (someone with no friends ik). I keep hearing everyone say it's the best years of our lives and i'm having a blast by myself I take myself places to study and shop but I guess I have had fomo for 4+ years.

1r6yvwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1r6yvwl/bare_minimum_streamers_shouldnt_stream_at_all/,Bare Minimum Streamers Shouldn't Stream at All,"Streamers are like athletes in the sense that we are an audience that watches them play. We dogged on other streamers, like XQC or even Ninja, for tryharding before, but I always believed that the should be *tryhards* even if they're playing amongst friends (which are often other streamers).

Many times, you'll see it happen. Someone in the chat says something along the lines of ""you're not even trying"" and the streamer will say something like ""I'm playing with friends, we're just having fun""

No. This is your job. Be good at it. We understand a learning curve. We get making mistakes. But to always go trololololo just because you've chosen to play a game for the nth time because it's the only thing that's consistently gotten you views, but you're clearly so tired of it. *Oh but I can play however I want if you don't like it just watch something else...* Then why not just stop playing that specific game instead of not even trying? You'd be mad at your barista if they were giggling and taking their time to make your cup of coffee (the hundredth one that day) because they were just tired of it and they decided to talk to their friends. 

Think NBA. Steph can play flashy, have fun on the court. Ok. At the end of the day, he always plays to win. He puts up numbers. He is literally playing with his 'friends', too. If an NBA player simply lets opposing players run past him and not try on defense, he get called out - and they should be called out.

I am watching streamers to play a game, that is above everything else. I am not watching you to have lols with your friends. At the root of it. We all watch streamers to play. If they don't win, it also sucks for us rooting for the streamer. Imagine if they lost because they're trying too hard to just put jokes out there and try to be funny. Imagine if they go on a tangent about a single white hair on his mustache for far too long, trying to be funny. Be funny... and TRY! You know what, just get off the game and maybe try comedy if that's your schtick. 

Streamers are also like athletes in a sense that they shouldn't be drunk or high when they're playing with other people who don't partake. I understand that there are drunk or high streams - and those are cool since they title them as such and let you, the viewer, know beforehand. You can ignore them. 

But I don't want to watch a streamer and hear the person they invited play on a lobby and hear them take a hit, slur their words, or flat out say ""I don't care I'm high"". Literally just play with your friends offline then. Paul George playing with mental health meds got suspended for 25 games. That streamer should just get off the lobby. That should have been a bare minimum.

And you know the other people in the lobby are talking over the person taking an audible bong rip (not even muting their side) so that they don't violate some guideline or policy or some shit. They are actively aware it is not good for the general audience. Then stop inviting those people!

And what is up with horny af streamers? Like all they say is some semblance of love for their homies but there are just too many cock and penis jokes and innuendos. One time may have been funny, twice may have been a callback, even the third I can forgive... But ALL. THE. DAMN. TIME?

*If I don't like it, just watch something else... You're being toxic... blah blah blah.* Okay, Ben Simmons. Where are you now? 

At the end of the day, we want to watch streamers play and try. They can provide the commentary, it's fine. Just... try. You mean to say you can't spare 4, maybe 5, hours a day on your not-even-best behavior? You're potentially getting millions from your audience. Don't we deserve effort? You have a job that many others would kill for. Like... Come on.",1,1771310631.0,Rants,0,1.0,False
1r6yvos,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6yvos,This is healing 🌸,"Context: Ako yung tipo ng officemate na since magkakateam tayo, pag may nagyaya na lumabas para bumili ng food, madalas sumasama ako, minsan hindi. And everytime na lalabas, nakatutok sa phone or nakikinig ng music lalo na kapag madami kaming magkakasama. Sanay na nasa likod lang banda kapag naglalakad. Pag di kinausap keri lang. 

So nung dumating yung isang araw na lumabas kami para bumili ng pagkain, same situation na nasa likod lang ako. Ramdam kong ayaw nila akong kasama nun base sa body language nila at sa tono ng pagkakasabi nung isa na ""eh bakit kapa sumama dito"" nung nag detour kami sa isang giftshop before bumili ng food. 

Fast forward after lunch, same girl posted a note saying ""hindi mo ramdam na ayaw ka namin kasama?"" at nung nabasa ko yun, nanlamig yung buong katawan ko. Alam kong ako yung tinutukoy nya. So I replied and nagseen lang sya na nagbigay na sakin ng confirmation. 

I opened up to my boyfriend about this the same day. I was sad for the whole week. Iwas akong makasama sila sa pantry or makasabay kahit saan. 

First time kong kumain ng lunch sa pantry kanina na magisa. Magkachat kami ni lab after. This is what I received.

1r6yvij,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1r6yvij/how_to_eat_and_live_as_a_poor/,How to eat and live as a poor.,"wassup. I'm poor just like you all.

Went from 6 fig salary to neg 40k networth at 22. (corporate layoffs that i never truly recovered from)

Nearly halfway out of the hole on a household income (married) of only 4k after tax near Atlanta.

The number 1 thing that we cut was food costs, and it seems to be the one thing people just can't seem to understand so I figured I'd post a pretty simple guide of how to eat and live for cheap.

1. Price per Meal

This may sound harsh, but if you're poor, you should literally never spend more than 5$ per meal to feed yourself. McDonald's isn't a right. You can make breakfast sandwiches (egg, cheese, bread, mayo) for less than a dollar, you can cook a crock pot of chili for less than 20$ that should feed you for nearly a week, you can make a pot of spaghetti for less than 10$ that should feed your for nearly a week, you can make bologna sandwiches for less than a dollar, beanies and weenies, baked potato soup, etc. Energy drinks are stupid, a thermos of coffee will last all day and cost pennies. Water comes from the tap for like 1 cent a bottle. Sweet tea powder is like 5$ to make 10 gallons.

If you are spending more than 5$ per meal, you are messing up somewhere. And I promise your kids won't care unless you've spoiled them horribly. If they are older, they should be able to comprehend the need for their parents to save money.

2. Generic brands and sales.

Super obvious, but if you don't make enough for a yearly vacation, you don't make enough for Kelloggs or Kraft. Buy generic products whenever you can, or if a sale is really good, take advantage of it.

3. Convience is the devil

Again, if you don't have the money for a nice yearly vacation, you can't afford literally anything inside of a gas station except for gas for the car (exception for cigarettes, but even then watch how much you spend, buy cheap cigs if you have to smoke, they are all pretty damn similar speaking from experience)

4. Rent

If you are spending more than 25% of your income on rent, move.

this one can suck, but being poor sucks worse. Suck it up for a few years and move to a shithole. It is what it is. My wife and I went from a luxury apartment to a literal 500 sqft moldy shack in the ghetto for 1k for a couple years. wasn't fun, but it allowed me to pay off more debt in less time while working as an Amazon delivery person.

5. Activities

Every time you leave the house is a minimum of 100$.

Stop. Buy a switch off of marketplace and a couple games and don't leave the house unless it's for errands or work. We live in an age where YouTube is free, games are fairly cheap for the amount of time that can be sunk into them for pleasure time, and you can do bodyweight workouts with a professional through a screen for free.

If you are bored, it's kind of your own fault.

6. Subscriptions

Are we even serious? No.

No Amazon Prime, no Spotify, no YouTube Premium, no Netflix, no hello fresh. Its point blank stupid.

7. Budget DAILY

You should literally know where EVERY dollar goes.

check your banking app every. single. day. 

nothing should surprise you.

8. Debt

focus on smallest balance first or largest APY (personally smallest balance works better, standard snowball method. if you have too many and feel overwhelmed, stop paying any except the ONE you are focused on first/next. Fuck your credit score, most of you/us aren't buying a home anytime soon and you can get a beater car off of marketplace for like 3-5k if yours ends up with serious issues.)

At the end of the day if you're poor

a: Its nothing to be ashamed of. shit mf happens.

b: Only you can fix it. So live like you're even poorer than you are and save/pay down debt/adapt.

In the great depression people ate roadkill. I'm certain you can handle chili/speghetti 3x a week and drinking coffee instead of pricy snacks and drinks.

not a perfect person obviously. but when I started this debt/poverty journey it seemed impossible to the point I attempted suicide and had to be locked up. (living wayyyyyyyyyy beyond our means) it takes years of dedication. but its either sacrifice NOW or sacrifice later. No one wants to still be broke at 60.",1,1771310590.0,povertyfinance,0,0.67,False
1r6yv0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1r6yv0w/how_i_quit_and_accidentally_unlocked_my_final/,How I Quit and Accidentally Unlocked My Final Boss Form,"I am a 36 year old transwoman that is pansexual androcentric and ambiamorous. I genuinely like being authentic with the eyeshadow, eye liner and my favorite pair of pants that are very affirming. You know? I got that grunge girl vibes going on. But anyway here we go...

I spent 1.4 years at a company in an IT related role. During that time I socially transitioned further while working there. The job itself was a sedentary ten hour grind that could literally put you to sleep. My gender queer coworker whom is like my best friend would pass out while staring at the screen waiting for jump scare or anything to stay awake. But that was not even the exhausting part.

Workplace culture was really toxic. I experienced repeated misgendering, hostile commentary, and inappropriate discussions about my body. It was like they wanted to know what was under my bra and in my pants! Why are these wierdos so obessed?Then the political rhetoric constantly bled into the workplace, turning what should have been a professional environment into something adversarial.

 It honestly felt like I was the first trans woman they had ever met in the wild.  Instead of acting professional, several grown men became insecure toddlers. Correcting them was like talking to a brick wall. At least the brick wall has better comprehension.

I reported these issues. HR’s handling lacked clarity, consistency, and transparency. Despite raising concerns multiple times, nothing meaningfully improved. I was dismissed repeatedly, sometimes literally in tears, because it was becoming unsafe to continue working there.

Eventually I started playing Red Rover with their logic.

Red Rover, Red Rover, send basic critical thinking right over.

They would say I could not use my pronouns or my name. I would respond along the lines of, “Clayton v. Bostock, bitch.” Mic drop.

On top of that, I was pressured to use the wrong restroom against my gender identity. Somehow I was also roped in with the men whenever the restroom looked like a disaster. For the record, I sit to relieve myself. Thank you very much. I am not the reason the restroom looks like a biohazard zone from something the movie Alien popped out of.

Reported harassment.

Watch management reach into the Ass Hat of Consequences and pull out performance issues. Corporate magic is wild. Totally not retaliation! That could'nt be possibly it? Bet you it is!

I left the meeting speaking Japanese under my breath like an anime antagonist. Bakayaro desu. Corporate villain arc activated. The irony is I am the only translator for that division. Good luck with that.

I wrapped up my last task, walked over to my genderqueer coworker who I absolutely adore, left my number and said, “Call me. Coffee soon. We can talk about real men in uniforms.” He lost it laughing.

Then I looked at the lead and said directly, “I quit.” He became a deer in headlights. He thought I was joking. I was not.

I explained why. A cis woman nearby asked what happened. I told her. She instantly became pissed. Turns out I’m not the only one tired of the nonsense.

Oh and by the way, the company is about to get sued by a bunch of cis women for the similiar garbage. Imagine that! Wow mind blown! Kapow!

So fluff yeah. Let’s go! I quit, freedom byatches! I walked out with Pride energy like a final boss yelling, ‘I love being a trans woman!’”",0,1771310544.0,MtF,0,0.5,False

1r6yr21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6yr21,Honolulu Trip Update,"We are a family of four who traveled from SFO to HNL for a week, and we absolutely fell in love with Oʻahu. We really enjoyed Honolulu, Waikiki Beach, Beach Walk, North Shore, the Buddhist temple, Manoa Falls, Lyon Arboretum, and Hoʻomaluhia Botanical Garden. We covered almost everything on the island except the Waianae side.

We stayed at the Hilton Waikiki Beach Resort & Spa and paid around $1,800 for 7 nights for a room with two queen beds. We mostly used the hotel just for sleeping, getting ready, and showers.

We ate almost every meal outside and found some really great spots. Maguro Spot was always crowded. We loved Eggs ’n Things for breakfast, and for dinner we tried places like Noi Thai, Tom’s Huli Huli Chicken at Royal Hawaiian Center, Marugame Udon, and Oahu Mexican Grill, which has an excellent beachfront seating area.

Day 1:  
We visited Ala Moana Center, Pearl Harbor, and took the Skyline rail just so the kids could experience it — they really enjoyed it.

Day 2:  
We went to Tantalus Lookout, explored the Kakaʻako street art, stopped at HMart for snacks and fruit, and visited Dole Plantation. The kids loved the train ride and maze. One thing that disappointed me at Dole Plantation was that they didn’t make fresh pineapple juice in front of you. Instead, they used large gallon containers. Later, we drove through Kamehameha Highway to the North Shore, visited Turtle Bay Resort, and ended the day at Laniakea Beach for sunset. The ocean there was rough compared to Waikiki, and the drive itself was beautiful.

Day 3:  
We spent the morning at Waikiki Beach, then visited the Buddhist temple and Hoʻomaluhia Botanical Garden. The kids loved feeding the birds and fish at the temple — we probably spent around $20 on bird and fish food, but it was worth it.

Day 4:  
We hiked to Manoa Falls, explored Lyon Arboretum, and had lunch at Morning Glass Coffee (they close at 2 PM). The kids loved the hot chocolate, and we enjoyed the omelet, sandwich, and coffee with macadamia nut milk.

Day 5:  
We visited the Polynesian Cultural Center and Kahuku Sugar Mill. We tried Giovanni’s Shrimp Truck, but honestly, I preferred Fumi’s Kahuku Shrimp at Ala Moana Center. I was surprised that the shrimp are served with the shell on everywhere except at Maguro Spot — it takes extra time to peel before eating.

Day 6:  
We went to the Kapiolani Community College Farmers Market hoping to try a variety of local fruits. It was smaller than expected, but we tried new fruits like eggfruit, cherimoya (similar to custard apple in Asia), and soursop. Later, we hiked Diamond Head State Park and enjoyed the amazing views of Waikiki. We planned to do the Makapuʻu Lighthouse Trail, but the kids were tired. Instead, we drove and stopped at lookout points like Halona Blowhole Lookout and Lānaʻi Lookout, spending 10–15 minutes at each stop.

Day 7:  
Whenever we visit a new state, we always take pictures at the State Capitol building. So we visited the Hawaii State Capitol and then spent the rest of the day browsing around Royal Hawaiian Center and International Market Place, walking around with sugarcane and pineapple juice in hand.

In the evenings, my wife and I spent some time at beachside bars with live music like The Beach Bar at Moana Surfrider (great and affordable cocktails) and House Without A Key (a bit more expensive).

We usually left the hotel by 8 AM and returned around 6–7 PM. After showers and dinner, we’d walk along Kuhio Avenue while the kids relaxed in the room watching TV or using their devices.

All in all, we spent close to $4,000 including hotel, car rental, food, flight tickets. I found a great parking option about 10 minutes from the hotel as our Hotel is charging $55 per night plus tax (damn) — Queen Kapiolani Park (Thank you Queen K), where parking is free overnight from 6 PM to 10 AM, and only 50 cents per hour after 10 AM.

Overall, it was an unforgettable trip, and we truly loved Oʻahu, and can't wait to visit again. Next time, we are planning to stay in an apartment with kitchen and plan to use Holo Cards and Bus.",7,1771310152.0,VisitingHawaii,3,1.0,False

1r6yocq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r6yocq/how_to_seduce_anyone_according_to_robert_greene/,How to Seduce Anyone According to Robert Greene: Science-Backed Power Dynamics That Actually Work,"Okay so I've been obsessed with Robert Greene's work lately. Read all his books, binged his podcast interviews, dissected his frameworks. The guy's basically the Machiavelli of our time and his insights on seduction and power are genuinely mind-blowing once you get past the initial ""wait, is this manipulation?"" phase.



Here's what nobody tells you: seduction isn't what you think it is. It's not about pick-up lines or playing games or negging people into submission. Greene defines it as the ability to enter someone else's spirit, to get inside their psyche and give them exactly what they're craving. And before you get all moral on me, realize you're already doing this every day, you're just doing it badly or unconsciously.



After consuming literally everything Greene has produced plus diving into psychology research and interviewing techniques, I've distilled the actual playbook that works. Not the cringe Reddit advice. Not the alpha male podcast BS. The real stuff backed by decades of historical analysis and human behavior patterns.



\*\*1. Stop trying to be interesting. Be interested instead.\*\*



This is counterintuitive as hell but it's the foundation of everything. Most people walk into interactions thinking ""how do I make them like me?"" Wrong question. The right question is ""what do they desperately want to feel right now?""



Greene breaks this down in The Art of Seduction using historical examples. Cleopatra didn't seduce Caesar and Mark Antony by being the hottest woman in Egypt (she wasn't, historically speaking). She studied them obsessively. She knew Caesar wanted to feel like a god among men, so she literally had herself delivered to him rolled up in a carpet like a divine gift. She knew Antony craved adventure and escape from Roman bureaucracy, so she turned their relationship into an exotic fantasy.



The psychology here is solid. People are fundamentally self-absorbed, not because they're bad but because they're constantly dealing with their own insecurities and desires. When you focus intensely on understanding them rather than performing for them, you become like water taking the shape of whatever container you're in. You become what they need.



\*\*2. Create a sense of mystery and selective vulnerability\*\*



Everyone tells you to ""be yourself"" which is decent advice wrapped in vagueness. What Greene teaches is more nuanced: reveal yourself strategically in layers.



The neuroscience backs this up. Our brains are prediction machines constantly trying to figure out patterns. When someone is entirely predictable, the brain gets bored and stops paying attention. When someone is completely chaotic, the brain perceives threat and withdraws. The sweet spot is calculated unpredictability.



Here's how this plays out practically: share deep truths about yourself but not all at once. Maybe you reveal a childhood fear in one conversation, then three weeks later you share an embarrassing failure, then later a secret ambition. Each revelation feels like unlocking a new level of intimacy. Between revelations, you maintain some distance, some unknowability.



I saw this technique dissected in a[ Chris Williamson](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) podcast with Greene where they discussed how the most magnetic people throughout history were paradoxes. They were strong yet vulnerable, confident yet humble, present yet slightly distant. The contradiction creates intrigue.



\*\*3. Make them feel powerful, not small\*\*



This is where most people fuck up seduction entirely. They think it's about demonstrating their own value, showing off accomplishments, proving their worth. That triggers competition instincts, not attraction.



Real seduction makes the other person feel like the most interesting, capable, attractive version of themselves when they're around you. It's basically strategic ego inflation but in a genuine way.



Greene references this in 48 Laws of Power (yeah I know people find that book controversial but it's essentially descriptive not prescriptive). Law 1 is never outshine the master, which applies to all relationships. When your boss feels smart around you, they promote you. When your date feels witty and attractive around you, they want more of that feeling, which means more of you.



Practically: ask questions that let them showcase expertise. ""I've been thinking about X, you seem to really understand this, what's your take?"" Notice small details about them that reveal effort or taste. ""These are great shoes, most people wouldn't think to pair that color with..."" Let them teach you things. People fall in love with students who make them feel like worthy teachers.



\*\*4. Create shared secrets and private worlds\*\*



This one's subtle but incredibly powerful. Seduction requires building an alternate reality that only the two of you inhabit.



Inside jokes are the most basic version. But go deeper. Create private rituals, use language only you two understand, establish places that feel like ""yours,"" reference shared experiences in ways that exclude others.



Why does this work? Research on social bonding shows that group cohesion strengthens dramatically when there's an in-group/out-group dynamic. When you and someone else share something that excludes the rest of the world, even something trivial, it creates psychological intimacy.



One book that explores this beautifully is Attached by[ Amir Levine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) and Rachel Heller. It's about attachment theory but it reveals how humans are literally wired to bond through shared experiences that create a sense of ""us against the world"" or ""us in our own world.""



This is why long-term couples have annoying private jokes. This is why affair partners often feel more intense than marriages. The secrecy itself heightens the bond.



\*\*5. Master the push-pull dynamic\*\*



Greene is explicit about this: seduction requires tension. Constant availability kills desire. Constant distance kills connection. You need both in rhythm.



Give attention then withdraw it slightly. Show interest then focus elsewhere. Be warm then be aloof. Not in a manipulative way but in a natural way that mirrors how desire actually works.



The psychology term for this is ""intermittent reinforcement"" and it's the most powerful behavior conditioning mechanism that exists. Slot machines use it. Social media notifications use it. Great seducers use it.



You give someone an amazing conversation, then you're busy for a few days. You have an incredible date, then you take 24 hours to text back. You share something vulnerable, then you're mysteriously private about something else. Each withdrawal makes the next approach more impactful.



Just don't be weird about it. This isn't about playing games, it's about maintaining your own life and interests so you're not constantly available. Which leads to the next point.



\*\*6. Maintain independent value\*\*



Nothing kills seduction faster than neediness. And neediness stems from having nothing else going on in your life.



The most seductive people are genuinely busy with projects, passions, and pursuits that matter to them independent of any relationship. This isn't fake scarcity, it's real investment in your own life.



When you have your own shit going on, several things happen: you become more interesting because you have more to talk about, you're less available which creates the natural push-pull mentioned above, you're less desperate because this person isn't your only source of validation, and you trigger the psychological principle of social proof (if other things value your time, you must be valuable).



I'd recommend Essentialism by Greg McKeown here. It's about focusing your energy on what truly matters rather than trying to please everyone. When you apply this to relationships, you stop bending over backwards to accommodate others and instead invite them into your world selectively.



If you want a more structured way to work through all these books and insights without spending months reading, there's an app called[ BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been useful. Built by former Google AI researchers, it turns books like The Art of Seduction, Influence, and Attached into personalized audio based on what you're actually trying to improve. You can tell it something specific like ""I want to become more magnetic in dating but I'm naturally introverted"" and it'll pull relevant strategies from multiple sources, create a learning plan tailored to your situation, and let you customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are solid too, there's even a smooth, conversational style that makes psychology concepts way easier to absorb during commutes or at the gym.



\*\*7. Use storytelling to bypass resistance\*\*



Facts tell, stories sell. This is basic persuasion but people constantly ignore it in seduction.



When you tell someone ""I'm adventurous,"" they might believe you or they might not. When you tell them about the time you accidentally ended up at an underground poker game in Budapest because you followed the wrong group of people from a bar, they experience your adventurousness.



Greene talks extensively about how seduction is theater. You're not just communicating information, you're creating an emotional experience. Stories do this automatically.



Plus, stories allow you to reveal yourself indirectly which feels more authentic than direct claims. You can demonstrate confidence through a story about handling a difficult situation rather than saying ""I'm confident."" You can show vulnerability through a story about failure rather than announcing ""I have flaws too.""



The book Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath breaks down why stories work neurologically. They activate more parts of the brain than facts, they're more memorable, and they create emotional resonance that pure information can't match.



\*\*8. Study their insecurities and desires obsessively\*\*



This sounds borderline creepy but hear me out. Everyone has deep insecurities and unfulfilled desires they desperately want addressed but rarely voice directly.



Maybe someone seems confident but you notice they constantly seek validation about their intelligence. Maybe they appear independent but their stories reveal they're lonely. Maybe they project success but they're clearly burned out and crave permission to rest.



When you can identify these hidden needs and address them subtly, you become irreplaceable. You're not just another person in their life, you're the person who truly sees them.



This requires genuine observation and empathy. Listen not just to what people say but how they say it. Notice what topics they return to repeatedly. Pay attention to what makes them defensive or what makes them light up.



Robert Greene's mastery is analyzing historical figures and identifying their core psychological drivers. Caesar needed glory. Napoleon needed to prove his worth despite his origins. Cleopatra needed political survival. Once you understand someone's core driver, you can position yourself as essential to fulfilling it.



\*\*9. Cultivate patience and strategic timing\*\*



Seduction cannot be rushed. Trying to force intimacy or commitment before someone's ready triggers resistance and withdrawal.



The best seducers plant seeds and wait. They create positive associations gradually. They advance two steps then retreat one. They let tension build naturally rather than forcing resolution.



There's a concept in Influence by Robert Cialdini called ""commitment and consistency."" People are more likely to commit to something if they've made small commitments leading up to it. Each small yes makes the next yes easier.



So you don't ask someone to fall in love with you. You ask for coffee. Then you ask to share an appetizer. Then you suggest a walk. Then you propose a weekend trip. Each step feels natural because it's only slightly beyond the previous commitment level.



This requires genuine patience and outcome independence. You can't be attached to a specific timeline. You're playing the long game because anything worth having is worth working for strategically.



\*\*10. Develop genuine self-possession and calm\*\*



Here's the thing that Greene emphasizes but people miss: all these techniques fall apart if you're fundamentally insecure and desperate.



Real seduction requires a foundation of self-possession. You need to genuinely be okay if this doesn't work out. You need to have enough going on in your life that no single person can make or break your happiness.



This isn't fake confidence or pretending you don't care. It's actual internal security that comes from knowing your worth isn't determined by whether someone chooses you.



People can smell desperation from a mile away. They can also sense genuine confidence and self-possession. When you're truly comfortable with yourself, you stop trying so hard and paradoxically become more attractive.



The School of Life has excellent content on this. They break down how self-love isn't narcissism, it's the foundation for healthy relationships. When you don't need someone else to complete you, you're free to want them, which is infinitely more attractive than need.



Look, I get that some of this sounds calculated or manipulative. And it absolutely can be if used with bad intentions. But here's my take after studying this for months: we're all already trying to influence each other constantly. The question isn't whether to do it but whether to do it consciously and ethically.



Greene's work isn't about turning you into a sociopath. It's about understanding human nature deeply enough to create genuine connections based on what people actually respond to rather than what we wish they responded to. The most magnetic people in history understood these dynamics instinctively. The rest of us need to study them deliberately.



Use this knowledge to build real relationships where both people feel seen, valued, and genuinely connected. Or ignore it and keep wondering why your honest, authentic approach keeps failing despite everyone saying ""just be yourself.""

It ended around March last year. We continued working together at a seasonal restaurant but didn’t really speak much over the summer. (We work at a seasonal summer restaurant)

Toward the end of summer, we started talking again. Early on, I told her I still had feelings for her and that I would try to be “just friends,” but I wasn’t sure I could fully separate my feelings. She said she understood. I was debating going back to my job as a manager at another restaurant were we both worked prior to the summer. She was going back I ended up going back.

We then started spending a lot of time together hanging out 3–4 times a week, getting dinner weekly after work, long coffee meetups, long phone calls, etc. There was physical affection and intimacy involved, and we hooked up a few times over a couple months.

Throughout this period, she consistently said we were “just friends.” She also said that with everything going on in her life (school, internship, work, health issues), she didn’t want a relationship with anyone right now. I tried to respect that and essentially waited around, thinking maybe timing was the issue.

What confused me was that her actions didn’t always align with the “just friends” label. She was physically affectionate, emotionally very open, and would say things like I’m the only person she can be 100% herself around. She also made comments about wanting to sleep with me while still maintaining we were just friends.

When I expressed frustration about what felt like mixed signals, she said she was setting a boundary. From my perspective, the behavior and the label didn’t match.

Eventually, after I brought up the inconsistency, she pulled back. We still texted and talked, but less frequently.

Important context: We now work together again and I am technically her manager. Over the summer when we reconnected, we were on the same level at a different job. The mutual friend involved is also someone I supervise. Who has ran through quite a few girls from work. 

Recently, I overheard that this mutual friend might be trying to hook up with her. He told multiple people he was going to try, despite others saying it was a bad idea and or fucked up. I also saw her initials in his recent calls after giving him a ride when he was drunk. He lied about who it was, and also kept mentioning how he had to call her back like 7 times. 

That night I called her and calmly asked if she was talking to him. She initially said no. A couple of days later, after someone else hinted they might be involved, I asked her again and she said they were “friends” who text and occasionally call. So they both lied about it which makes the hair in the back of my neck stand up. 

I told her that if she wants to talk to other people I can’t control that, but it feels different when it’s someone in my friend circle and workplace. I admitted that given our recent history, it’s hard for me not to care. She said it should be totally fine if I had a friend and she liked him and he liked her, that I shouldn’t care about it and would be wrong to. 

She got upset and said I was being controlling and crossing boundaries. She said she doesn’t want anything with me and that if I continue contacting her about this she’ll escalate it to management. I called once after that and then texted saying I’d leave her alone.

From her perspective, we haven’t been together for over a year. From my perspective, the recent intense period especially after I was upfront about still loving her makes it feel more current and complicated. I now feel like I may have been getting used.

My first weeks pregnancy symptoms were really weird: 

First I was veryyyy moody and picking fights with my husband for anything and everything. Second, the iced coffee I used to take every day started to give me stomachaches. Then I felt sick like if I had the flu.

I finally did my test last friday! And went to the doctor right away. He gave me some prescriptions and sadly we couldn’t see baby. Hopefully this week🤞🏽🤞🏽

This week my symptoms have been: 

\- shortness of breath, as in getting tired just by laying in the couch😂 It reminded me of the first time I had covid 

\- Pulling sensation from my belly button that comes and goes. I’m a bit worried about this one because I think it’s too early??? 

\- Some mild acne/small pimples in my face

\- Can’t sleep :D the belly button thing it’s giving me anxiety. 

I’m a bit panicking with all of the changes in the body and generally scared about medical stuff, but also really happy and excited and taking it all in for my baby🥹",1,1771308910.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False

1r6y6dl,https://i.redd.it/f8d9htdowzjg1.png,How to Boost Your Metabolism with the Right Foods,"# Introduction

Metabolism is the whole life-sustaining chemical processes that take place in the body. The metabolic process converts the food and drink that you consume into energy. A high metabolic rate equates to a high calorie-burning rate, and a slower metabolism equals less burning and generally more fat deposition. This guide will help you if you are curious about boosting your metabolism for energy, burning fat, [achieving your fitness goal](https://evolvebiolabs.com/), or just feeling good all around. In this article, we will talk about foods that can help enable metabolism and energize the body.

# 1. Understanding Metabolism

Before we get into foods that increase metabolism, let's first see how it works. Your metabolism is determined by various factors:

**Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** The amount of calories your body requires to sustain minimum functions (breathing, digestion, circulation, etc.).



**Physical Activity:** Movement and exercise can help boost your energy expenditure.



**Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** The energy needed to digest, absorb, and metabolize food.



**Age, Gender, and Genetics:** These factors can influence your metabolic rate.

# 2. Foods That Naturally Boost Your Metabolism

# Protein-Rich Foods

When you consume food, your body requires energy to digest and absorb it. This is called the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). Foods containing protein contain more TEF than fats and carbohydrates, which implies that your body expends more energy to digest them.

* Lean Meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef)
* Fish and Seafood (salmon, tuna, shrimp, mackerel)
* Eggs
* Legumes and Beans (lentils, chickpeas, black beans)
* Nuts and Seeds (almonds, chia seeds, flaxseeds)

# Green Tea and Coffee

Both green tea and coffee are known to possess thermogenic activity, that is, they make your body burn extra calories.

**Green Tea:** Green tea is rich in catechins, specifically [epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigallocatechin_gallate), which might enhance fat burning.



**Coffee:** The caffeine in coffee activates your central nervous system, which can briefly raise your metabolic rate.

# Spicy Foods

Spices like chili peppers have a compound called capsaicin, which has been found to raise metabolism temporarily by increasing body temperature and causing thermogenesis.

* Chili peppers
* Jalapeños
* Cayenne pepper
* Paprika

# Whole Grains and Fiber-Rich Foods

Fiber breaks down slowly and is difficult for your body to digest, potentially [boosting your metabolic rate](https://medium.com/@emmaswift02/how-strength-training-can-boost-your-metabolism-and-burn-fat-8785d4c39865). Also, whole grains take more energy to digest compared to processed carbs and thus are more beneficial when it comes to increasing the metabolism.

* Oats
* Quinoa
* Brown rice
* Whole wheat bread
* Vegetables (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, leafy greens)
* Fruits (berries, apples, pears)

# 3. Hydration and Metabolism

Having a sufficient quantity of water intake is essential for overall well-being, yet it may even contribute to a higher metabolism. According to research, water consumption can increase your metabolism by 30% for approximately 30–40 minutes.

**Cold Water:** Drinking cold water can increase your metabolism as your body struggles to heat it to body temperature.



**Electrolyte Drinks:** Having a good balance of electrolytes, particularly in warm weather or after exercise, can keep your metabolism functioning properly.

# 4. Meal Timing and Frequency

# Eating Every 3–4 Hours

Instead of eating large meals infrequently, try eating smaller meals every 3–4 hours. This helps keep your blood sugar stable and your metabolism going. Skipping meals will reduce your metabolism as your body enters ""conservation"" mode, holding onto energy for an extended amount of time.

# Don't Skip Breakfast

Missing breakfast can make you lose your morning metabolism, as your body might take it as a starvation signal. Having a healthy, protein-packed breakfast can kickstart your metabolism and provide you with the energy you need for the rest of the day.

# Post-Workout Meals

Following a workout, your body is in an anabolic phase, [repairing muscles and recovering](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolab/the-best-meal-plans-for-muscle-growth-113985658f09). Consuming protein and carbohydrates post-exercise replenishes energy reserves and repairs muscles, which also aids in speeding up metabolism.

# 5. Foods to Avoid for a Healthy Metabolism

**Refined sugars and carbohydrates:** These can cause insulin spikes, leading to fat storage and a sluggish metabolism.



**Processed foods:** High in unhealthy fats, sugars, and additives, processed foods can impair your metabolic rate.



**Excessive alcohol:** Alcohol can disrupt your metabolism and slow down fat burning.

# Conclusion

To get your metabolism upgraded, smart food choices and healthy lifestyle habits need to become second nature to you. Include protein, spice, whole grains, and good fats in your diet, and drink lots of water; this will very naturally boost the burning of fat and energy levels. Metabolic health can be promoted with regular exercise and good sleep, in addition to managing stress. Maintenance is the name of the game, so stay on track with these changes through thick and thin if you want to achieve the maximum benefits. Remember, a balanced diet and lifestyle play a critical role in improving metabolism and well-being.",1,1771308240.0,u_Evolvebiolab,0,1.0,False

Acidity, heartburn, and burning pain in the chest or upper stomach are extremely common problems in Chandigarh and nearby areas. Many people start taking acidity tablets on their own or continue the same medicine for years. Initially, the medicines work well. But after some time, patients notice something frustrating — the tablets no longer give relief.

If you are taking acidity medicines regularly but still feel burning, gas, bloating, sour burps, or stomach discomfort, you are not alone. This condition is medically known as refractory GERD, meaning acid reflux that does not respond properly to standard treatment.

*In this blog, Dr. Sandeep Pal explains why this happens, what it means for your digestive health, and how it can be managed correctly.*

# What Is GERD and Why Does It Happen?

GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) occurs when stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the food pipe. This backflow irritates the lining of the esophagus and causes symptoms like:

* Burning sensation in chest or throat
* Sour or bitter taste in mouth
* Gas and bloating
* Painful stomach cramps
* Nausea after meals
* Difficulty sleeping due to acidity

In North India, GERD is strongly linked to food habits, irregular meal timings, stress, and lifestyle factors.

# Why Acidity Medicines Stop Working Over Time

Many patients ask, “Doctor, earlier one tablet used to help, now even two don’t work.”

There are several important reasons for this:

**1. Incorrect Diagnosis:**

Not all burning or stomach pain is due to acid reflux. Conditions like gastritis, functional dyspepsia, bile reflux, or stress-related stomach disorders can feel similar but need different treatment.

**2. Wrong Timing of Medication:**

Acidity medicines work best when taken at a specific time (usually before meals). Taking them incorrectly reduces their effect.

**3. Overuse Without Medical Supervision:**

Long-term self-medication can reduce effectiveness and hide the real problem instead of treating it.

**4. Stress and Anxiety:**

Mental stress has a strong effect on the gut. Stress can increase acid production and make the stomach more sensitive, causing painful stomach cramps even with mild acidity.

**5. Diet and Lifestyle Triggers:**

Spicy food, fried snacks, late-night meals, tea, coffee, smoking, and alcohol can overpower the effect of medicines.

# Understanding Refractory GERD

When acidity symptoms continue despite proper medication, doctors call it refractory GERD. This does not mean the condition is dangerous, but it does mean that:

* The treatment plan needs review
* Lifestyle factors must be corrected
* Sometimes further evaluation is needed

Ignoring long-standing acidity can lead to complications like food pipe irritation, ulcers, or poor quality of life.

# Common Symptoms Patients Ignore

**Many people normalize these warning signs:**

* Daily acidity despite medication
* Frequent gas and bloating
* Pain after eating
* Night-time acidity disturbing sleep
* Burning pain spreading to chest or back
* Feeling full after small meals

If these symptoms last more than a few weeks, a gastroenterologist should be consulted.

# How Refractory GERD Is Managed Properly

At Dr. Sandeep Pal’s clinic in Sector 33, Chandigarh, treatment is personalized and step-wise.

**1. Detailed History and Medication Review**

Understanding when symptoms started, what triggers them, and which medicines are being used is crucial.

**2. Dietary Counseling**

Patients are guided on:Meal timingPortion sizeFoods to avoid and includeSimple North Indian diet modifications

**3. Stress Management Techniques**

Stress reduction plays a major role. Relaxation techniques, sleep correction, and counseling help calm the gut.

**4. Medication Adjustment**

Sometimes the dose, type, or combination of medicines needs correction — not just increasing tablets.

**5. Further Evaluation (If Needed)**

If symptoms persist, further testing may be advised to rule out gastritis, ulcers, or other digestive conditions.

# Why Ignoring Chronic Acidity Is Risky

**Untreated or poorly managed acidity can lead to:**

* Chronic gastritis
* Food pipe irritation
* Difficulty swallowing
* Poor appetite
* Sleep disturbances
* Reduced work productivity

Early evaluation prevents long-term problems.

# When Should You See a Gastroenterologist in Chandigarh?

**You should seek expert care if:**

* Acidity medicines stop working
* Symptoms last more than 2–3 weeks
* Pain is severe or recurring
* There is vomiting, weight loss, or black stools
* Stress worsens stomach symptoms

# FAQs — Common Patient Questions

**1. Is daily acidity normal?**

No. Occasional acidity is common, but daily symptoms need evaluation.

**2. Can stress alone cause acidity?**

Yes. Stress can trigger acid production and stomach sensitivity.

**3. Should I stop my acidity medicines suddenly?**

No. Always consult a doctor before stopping or changing medicines.

**4. Does spicy food permanently damage the stomach?**

Not permanently, but frequent intake worsens acidity symptoms.

**5. Is gas always related to acidity?**

No. Gas can occur due to poor digestion, food intolerance, or stress.

**6. Can acidity cause chest pain?**

Yes. Acid reflux pain can mimic heart pain.

**7. Is long-term acidity dangerous?**

If untreated, it can cause complications over time.

**8. Does late-night eating worsen GERD?**

Yes. Eating late increases acid reflux risk.

**9. Are home remedies enough?**

They help mild cases but cannot treat chronic GERD.

**10. Who should I consult for persistent acidity?**

A qualified gastroenterologist is the right specialist.

# Final Thoughts

If your acidity medicines are no longer giving relief, it is a signal — not a failure. It simply means your digestive system needs a better evaluation and personalized treatment plan.

**Dr. Sandeep Pal, a trusted gastroenterologist in Chandigarh**, helps patients identify the real cause behind persistent acidity, painful stomach cramps, and stress-related digestive issues.

Chapter 1 

I never thought my world would collapse because of an Instagram post. 

It was just after eleven on a Tuesday night. William had texted that he was working late-again-so I’d settled into our sitting room with a glass of cabernet, absently scrolling through social media while Chopin played softly in the background. The plush cream sofa enveloped me as rain tapped against the floor-to-ceiling windows of our Upper East Side penthouse. 

Then I saw it. 

My finger froze mid-scroll. The glass nearly slipped from my hand. 

It was a casual post from Devin Marsh, one of William’s associates: “Great minds at work even after hours #WallStreetNeverSleeps.” The photo showed a cozy corner of Verre, an exclusive wine bar in Tribeca. And there they were-William and his assistant Lily, huddled close in a leather booth. He was sketching what looked like market projections on a cocktail napkin, his head bent toward hers. But it wasn’t the impromptu lesson that made my stomach clench. 

It was the way she looked at him. 

Lily’s gaze held the unmistakable shine of adoration, her body angled toward his, their shoulders touching in a way that spoke of intimacy beyond professional boundaries. William’s wedding ring was nowhere in sight. 

I zoomed in, studying every pixel as if it might reveal a different truth. My hands trembled slightly as I typed a comment before I could stop myself: “Interesting work session. Didn’t know Verre was the new office.” I immediately regretted it, but couldn’t bring myself to 

delete it. 

I barely slept that night, William’s side of the bed remaining empty until dawn broke through our bedroom windows. 

The next morning, I waited in our kitchen, perched on a barstool at the marble island. I’d made his favorite breakfast-poached eggs on 

avocado toast-though my own stomach was too knotted to eat. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as William strode in, 

already dressed in a charcoal Tom Ford suit, checking his watch. 

“William, we need to talk about that photo from last night,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. 

He glanced up, his expression hardening instantly. “What photo?” 

“The one Devin posted. You and Lily at Verre.” 

A flash of something-annoyance? panic?-crossed his face before settling into a practiced mask of condescension. 

“Jesus, Natalie. This is exactly why I don’t tell you about work meetings. Your dirty mind turns everything into something it’s not.” He 

picked up his coffee, taking a dismissive sip. 

“Work meetings don’t usually happen in wine bars with your assistant gazing at you like that,” I countered, hating the defensive note in my voice. 

William’s jaw clenched. “Like what exactly? Like she’s learning from the best in the business? Because that’s what was happening. I was explaining the Reynolds merger strategy. 

“At eleven at night? In a romantic wine bar?” 

“For God’s sake, delete that ridiculous comment. You’re embarrassing yourself-and me.” His voice had dropped to that dangerous 

1/2 

Chapter 1 

quiet tone he used when truly angry. “I don’t have time for this paranoia. I’m leaving for Los Angeles this afternoon.” 

“Los Angeles? Since when?” My heart pounded against my ribs. “You didn’t mention any trip.” 

“It just came up. The Westridge acquisition needs attention.” He wouldn’t meet my eyes as he straightened his already perfect tie. “I don’t know when I’ll be back. Could be a week, could be longer.” 

The casual way he announced his indefinite departure felt like a slap. After seven years of marriage, this was what I’d become-an afterthought, someone to be informed rather than consulted. 

“William, please. Can we just talk about this?” 

“There’s nothing to talk about. Delete the comment, Natalie.” He grabbed his briefcase, his wedding ring suddenly visible and somehow obscene. “I have to go.” 

The door closed behind him with quiet finality, leaving me alone in our perfect kitchen, staring at a breakfast that would go uneaten. 

That night, sleep eluded me again. Around two in the morning, I found myself standing outside William’s home office, a room I rarely entered. Something pulled me forward-intuition or desperation, I couldn’t tell which. 

I switched on his desk lamp, casting a pool of warm light across the polished mahogany. His computer was password-protected, but he’d left his email open on his tablet. My fingers hesitated over the screen. I’d never snooped before—had prided myself on the trust 

between us. 

What a fool I’d been. 

I skimmed through his recent emails, my breath catching when I found a thread with Lily. Most were innocuous work exchanges, but several ended with “XO” or contained inside jokes I wasn’t privy to. One message about a “private strategy session” was scheduled for the exact time they’d been at Verre. 

I set the tablet down, a cold certainty settling in my chest where doubt had been swirling. As I switched off the lamp and closed the office door behind me, something else flickered to life inside me-something small but fierce, like an ember catching in dry kindling. 

I didn’t know it then, but that ember would soon become a blaze. ",3,1771308070.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

He was prescribed it for a UTI which turns out wouldn’t have worked anyway because the bacteria in the test doesn’t respond to Cipro. 😒 He had one night of insomnia, which, after reading about side effects, seems to be common. 

The next morning we were having a relaxing Sunday, sitting around listening to music drinking coffee. His mood started to shift dramatically out of nowhere. About 15 minutes later, I found him upstairs on the corner of our bed, sobbing uncontrollably, and wanting to throw himself out the window. He said he had the darkest and most suicidal thoughts that have ever crossed his mind, and he is a recovered alcoholic, who has had some pretty dark thoughts. My immediate reaction was to remember the one lorazepam I had on hand for some flying anxiety. I gave it to him and within about 10 minutes it brought him back down out of the worst place. He was pretty numb for a few hours and obviously didn’t take any more of the Cipro. That was a singular event and did not happen again but the PTSD was definitely lingering.

This all happened after taking it for 2 days. I’m very glad that this subreddit was here because I don’t think I would have known what was happening otherwise. I’m so sorry that some of you have such an extended reaction to this horrible drug.",2,1771308063.0,floxies,2,1.0,False

My finger froze mid-scroll. The glass nearly slipped from my hand. 

It was a casual post from Devin Marsh, one of William’s associates: “Great minds at work even after hours #WallStreetNeverSleeps.” The photo showed a cozy corner of Verre, an exclusive wine bar in Tribeca. And there they were-William and his assistant Lily, huddled close in a leather booth. He was sketching what looked like market projections on a cocktail napkin, his head bent toward hers. But it wasn’t the impromptu lesson that made my stomach clench. 

It was the way she looked at him. 

Lily’s gaze held the unmistakable shine of adoration, her body angled toward his, their shoulders touching in a way that spoke of intimacy beyond professional boundaries. William’s wedding ring was nowhere in sight. 

I zoomed in, studying every pixel as if it might reveal a different truth. My hands trembled slightly as I typed a comment before I could stop myself: “Interesting work session. Didn’t know Verre was the new office.” I immediately regretted it, but couldn’t bring myself to 

delete it. 

I barely slept that night, William’s side of the bed remaining empty until dawn broke through our bedroom windows. 

The next morning, I waited in our kitchen, perched on a barstool at the marble island. I’d made his favorite breakfast-poached eggs on 

avocado toast-though my own stomach was too knotted to eat. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as William strode in, 

already dressed in a charcoal Tom Ford suit, checking his watch. 

“William, we need to talk about that photo from last night,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. 

He glanced up, his expression hardening instantly. “What photo?” 

“The one Devin posted. You and Lily at Verre.” 

A flash of something-annoyance? panic?-crossed his face before settling into a practiced mask of condescension. 

“Jesus, Natalie. This is exactly why I don’t tell you about work meetings. Your dirty mind turns everything into something it’s not.” He 

picked up his coffee, taking a dismissive sip. 

“Work meetings don’t usually happen in wine bars with your assistant gazing at you like that,” I countered, hating the defensive note in my voice. 

William’s jaw clenched. “Like what exactly? Like she’s learning from the best in the business? Because that’s what was happening. I was explaining the Reynolds merger strategy. 

“At eleven at night? In a romantic wine bar?” 

“For God’s sake, delete that ridiculous comment. You’re embarrassing yourself-and me.” His voice had dropped to that dangerous

quiet tone he used when truly angry. “I don’t have time for this paranoia. I’m leaving for Los Angeles this afternoon.” 

“Los Angeles? Since when?” My heart pounded against my ribs. “You didn’t mention any trip.” 

“It just came up. The Westridge acquisition needs attention.” He wouldn’t meet my eyes as he straightened his already perfect tie. “I don’t know when I’ll be back. Could be a week, could be longer.” 

The casual way he announced his indefinite departure felt like a slap. After seven years of marriage, this was what I’d become-an afterthought, someone to be informed rather than consulted. 

“William, please. Can we just talk about this?” 

“There’s nothing to talk about. Delete the comment, Natalie.” He grabbed his briefcase, his wedding ring suddenly visible and somehow obscene. “I have to go.” 

The door closed behind him with quiet finality, leaving me alone in our perfect kitchen, staring at a breakfast that would go uneaten. 

That night, sleep eluded me again. Around two in the morning, I found myself standing outside William’s home office, a room I rarely entered. Something pulled me forward-intuition or desperation, I couldn’t tell which. 

I switched on his desk lamp, casting a pool of warm light across the polished mahogany. His computer was password-protected, but he’d left his email open on his tablet. My fingers hesitated over the screen. I’d never snooped before—had prided myself on the trust 

between us. 

What a fool I’d been. 

I skimmed through his recent emails, my breath catching when I found a thread with Lily. Most were innocuous work exchanges, but several ended with “XO” or contained inside jokes I wasn’t privy to. One message about a “private strategy session” was scheduled for the exact time they’d been at Verre. 

I set the tablet down, a cold certainty settling in my chest where doubt had been swirling. As I switched off the lamp and closed the office door behind me, something else flickered to life inside me-something small but fierce, like an ember catching in dry kindling.

The excitement of what's now possible has become potentially addictive, disrupting my sleep and spiking my cortisol early in the morning and my resting heart rate into the 80s during intense multi-terminal sessions. I built a Pixel Watch app to buzz me when my heart rate climbs too high as a reminder to chill. I want my normal sleep back. Anyone else finding Claude Code mildly addictive, or is it just me?

**Post:** I'm finding myself waking up at 5am, often earlier with my mind racing about ideas and various projects i'm working on for both my day job & evening / weekend freelancing. On top of that I'm thinking of my own ideas for my own apps to create an ongoing income for myself and my family.

I'm often missing my 7 hours sleep because my mind is waking me up and feeling a little stressed as well as excited about what can be achieved in such short times now with Claude. I also noticed my heart rate often going into the 80's when I'm thinking hard about the project and interacting sometimes with 5 to 6 different terminals working on different parts of a project. ....so I built in android studio, an app which buzzes my Pixel 4 smart watch if my heart rate goes up into the next range of 10's, like if it went from 70s to 80s, it tracks that each minute which reminds me to chill out with a little haptic feedback! ....I'm actually fit in my late 30's so really my heart rate pre-bedtime is mid 40's, so sat idle at a desk I wouldn't have thought it should be going above 60-70 really. I drink one coffee usually an hour after getting up. Maybe elevated due to excitement and maybe that excitement over time has become addiction? Maybe only mild? Potentially insidious.

Anyway, I wondered.. Is it Claude Code that's causing me to get up so early and spiking my cortisol levels because of that sense of vast opportunity combined with FOMO or maybe something else that is causing me to be to get up like the 'racey' feeling while working with it has crept in and got a bit addictive!? Maybe I'm talking rubbish, everyone else sleeps perfectly and doesn't have any 'addictive' emotions and feelings about Claude Code.

I don't want to be getting up silly hours, I want my normal sleep back and I think Claude Code is the culprit!

Chapter 1 

I never thought my world would collapse because of an Instagram post. 

It was just after eleven on a Tuesday night. William had texted that he was working late-again-so I’d settled into our sitting room with a glass of cabernet, absently scrolling through social media while Chopin played softly in the background. The plush cream sofa enveloped me as rain tapped against the floor-to-ceiling windows of our Upper East Side penthouse.

1r6y34d,https://www.reddit.com/r/exposingcabalrituals/comments/1r6y34d/doctors_should_be_suspicious_of_everything_they/,Doctors should be suspicious of everything they collectively promote as a trend.,"Doctors should be suspicious of everything they collectively promote as a trend.

**Low-salt diet**  
If you eat little salt, it becomes the root of all diseases, lowering immunity from colds to cancer. The most ideal salt is coarse salt containing brine, or at least sea salt, and if you eat more than two teaspoons a day, almost all adult diseases are cured and you won’t catch colds.

**Protein**  
Excessive protein intake causes cancer cells to multiply rapidly.

Once pores have widened, they cannot shrink.  
This is also a lie. You should not use mild soap; it must have some toxicity. Every day, our body produces whiteheads, which are waste products. If these whiteheads are not removed, they meet dust in the air, turn into blackheads, and clog pores. Since the skin must continuously expel whiteheads, pores inevitably widen. Washing your face should not be done just to avoid skin damage, but to completely remove oil. Even if the skin gets slightly damaged, it regenerates, and if you wash properly, widened pores can shrink again.

**When teeth hurt**  
This is due to periodontitis, where bacteria breed in the gums. Simply gargling with salt water cures it. If you go to the dentist, they will try to pull your teeth and do implants, so never go to the dentist. There is no limit to the number of times you can gargle with salt water, and most cases heal within a few days. Once cured, gargling with salt water for 30 seconds once or twice a day will prevent pain for life.

**Skipping dinner to lose weight**  
At first glance, this is true. But if you sleep hungry, it disturbs deep sleep, wakes you up often, and makes you tired. When tired, you crave sweets and coffee. Eating sweets increases appetite. Simply being tired raises appetite, so sleep disturbance leads to coffee, sweets, increased appetite, then more coffee, and more sleep disturbance—an endless vicious cycle. A glass of salt water is enough for breakfast, and among breakfast, lunch, and dinner, dinner should be the most filling to break this cycle. Weight loss is determined absolutely by the total amount eaten in a day, so eating before bed does not have a major impact.

**Vitamin C megadoses**  
The average pH of the human body is about 7.4, but Vitamin C has a strong acidity with a pH between 2.5 and 3. The more acidic the body becomes, the more actively cancer cells grow. In other words, this advice is not to make you healthy but to make you get cancer. If you become healthy, doctors starve to death as a profession.

**The truth**  
If the truth is revealed, 95% of hospitals will disappear, and hospitals will only remain for emergency patients. Therefore, doctors must spread countless lies to survive. Even with dieting alone, there have been 26,000 methods so far. The existence of 26,000 methods means there has never been a proper diet method. Dieting is a massive industry that exerts enormous influence on the economy of food, medicine, and health. That is why trends are continuously created—to stimulate the economy.

I struggle with spending money. irl and online. It causes me such massive anxiety as I'm also on the spectrum and have a trauma disorder. I've dealt with homelessness and rn, even though I'm in a stable environment, I have very limited income.

perhaps one of those or a lot of those things combined are causing it. idk my brain just does these following things.

1. is this item worth getting, is it worth my money?

2. will I just put this item to the side after a few days?

3. what if the item doesn't fit/look good or taste good?

overall, I'll just sit there, analyzing whether or not to get something (idk what other word to use other than analyzing)

regardless it makes shit so hard and frustrating because I'll get overwhelmed especially online

I wanna get new clothes but at the time I don't because I hate trying on clothes in stores due to me being the kind of person who heats up easily and guess what one of my sensory issues is?? heat 🥲 (thank goodness I don't live anywhere hot or humid LOL)

getting clothes online is also complicated. I suck at clothing sizes and I'd most likely get distressed if I got something that was too big and small. I can't keep my thoughts in order, I feel like a dog seeing a squirrel.

idk. spending money is hard and maybe the pros are that at least I'm not an impulsive buyer and don't immediately buy things. which sometimes is a lie bc I'll buy chocolate or a little treat from this very small asian grocery store (I've tried some sort of salted coffee canned drink and I've never seen it since which is besides the point) also going in that store also gives me anxiety for some other reason.

Idk! a lot of things I shouldn't be anxious over get me anxious and it feels like I'm fighting with a child at this point. there r two wolves inside me. (I wish I was joking and I have no idea how to explain it 💔)

uh, yeah. that's all of anyone has tips for buying things that'd be appreciated. idk should I just spin some wheel to determine what I should get?

Like our families see each other almost every weekend, we went to the same school for a while, and there was a point where she was honestly my closest friend out of everyone i knew. We told each other everything.

But over the past year or so things just started feeling different,.... Hard to explain at first, like nothing i could really put my finger on, just a vibe i was getting.

So a bit of background. I finished college earlier this year and started working a full time job. Nothing crazy, just a normal office job, but it was a big deal for me personally because i worked really hard to get there. M on the other hand is still figuring out what she wants to do, and like i genuinely mean it when i say i have zero judgment about that. Life isnt a race and everyone figures things out at their own pace. I never once made her feel bad about it, or at least i really tried not to.

But somewhere along the way she started making these comments. Little things at first that i brushed off as just her sense of humor because she has always been kind of a sarcastic person and i used to find it funny.

Stuff like must be nice to already have your life together whenever i mentioned anything work related. Or some of us dont have it easy like you if i talked about weekend plans. She started calling me corporate girl as like a nickname which sounds harmless but the way she said it was always a little... sharp? Like there was always just a tiny edge underneath it that i couldnt quite explain to anyone without sounding oversensitive.

And it wasnt just once in a while. It became kind of a pattern. If i mentioned being exhausted after a long week shed say something like try being unemployed and stressed, must be rough having a paycheck though. If i talked about saving up for a trip or something i wanted to buy shed go of course you can afford it with this little laugh. If i brought up anything about work at all, even just casually in conversation, there was almost always a comment waiting on the other side of it.

At first i genuinely just laughed it off every single time because i did not want to be the person who cant take a joke. I kept telling myself she didnt mean anything by it and i was probably just reading into things.

But then it started happening in front of other people. Family dinners, group hangouts, once even in front of some people we had just met that night. And something about having it happen in front of others made it feel worse somehow. Like i could feel myself getting quieter every time we were in a group together because i never knew when the next comment was coming and i didnt want to have to laugh it off again in front of everyone.

I started kind of dreading hanging out with her which made me sad because this is someone i genuinely love and used to look forward to seeing.

Then a few weeks ago we made plans to grab coffee, just the two of us. And within like the first twenty minutes she made a comment about how ive changed since i started working and that im too busy for real people now. And i dont know if it was just because i was already tired or because it had been building for so long but something about that one just hit different.

So i said something. I kept my voice calm, i wasnt trying to start a fight or make it dramatic, i just told her honestly that the jokes had been piling up and they were starting to feel genuinely hurtful and id really appreciate if she could ease up on them.

She did not take it well.

She got defensive almost immediately and told me i was being way too sensitive and acting like i was better than her. Said she was just teasing and that i was making a big deal out of nothing. The conversation got a little awkward after that and we kind of just moved on but it felt unresolved.

After that i just... stopped reaching out to make plans. I still reply to her texts when she messages me, i dont ignore her or anything, but i havent been the one to suggest getting together or initiate anything like i used to.

Well apparently that did not go unnoticed. My aunt called my mom recently and said M is upset, that she feels like ive suddenly gone cold on her and she doesnt understand why im being distant. Which like... i get that it probably does feel that way from her side but also she kind of never acknowledged what i said at the coffee thing.

Now theres a bit of a divide in the family. Some people think i should just brush it off, keep the peace, she was just joking around. Others actually understand where im coming from and think i had every right to say something and pull back a little.

And i really dont want this to turn into some massive family drama because i do care about M and i miss the friendship we used to have. But i also dont want to go back to feeling uncomfortable every single time we hang out and biting my tongue every time she makes a dig.

So AITA for slowly pulling back after she kept making those comments, even after i told her how i felt?",4,1771307476.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

My question is, how does a day on Vyvanse after a bad nights sleep feel for most people? 

In the past (before I was on Vyvanse) after a night like that of bad sleep I would be irritable and have difficulty concentrating, I would compensate with coffee which would make me anxious. The day would be a bit difficult.

I’m wondering if I will feel anxious/irritable on Vyvanse and if there’s any tips to ensure a better day so that I get a good nights sleep tonight ",5,1771307403.0,VyvanseADHD,4,1.0,False

1r6xtyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1r6xtyd/the_perfect_solo_board_game_sleeping_gods_distant/,The Perfect Solo Board Game: Sleeping Gods Distant Skies,"Let me begin by saying i have yet to fully complete 1 run of the campaign, but honestly can't see my opinion changing much. If you are on the fence about playing it, I strongly recommend you do, and i will talk about the reasons why.

 I don't usually play solo board games, and i've tried a few like This War of Mine, Roll Player Adventure, 7th Continent, Spirit Island, Jaws of the lion, Marvel Champions, Too Many Bones, Robinson Crusoe. of all those, none left a lasting impression in solo mode, and many i even didn't finish the campaign or the session.

1. The story. So far the story is great, not in the sense that it is very intriguing per se (it is not) but the world building is great, and all different parts of the story are connected by keywords which give you a sense of ""this is a consequence/continuation"" or ""i want to continue this story and see how it unfolds"", think of it as side quests which will unlock new optuons in certain locations. Also the card or book entry text is connected to the artwork of the campaign map where it's located. The story advances both through the text book as well as the quest cards.

2. Replayability. Originally i was decided to play it once and just sell it, but the unlockable stories by keywords, multiple decisions and paths, and the vastness of the world means you could have 2 or 3 plays and still miss much of what is to see. Also there's a rogue-lite mechanic in which by completing achievements (totems, persons, maps) you will unlock new cards you can start with in the next campaign. The game is also relatively cheap compared to other campaign games and smaller, so it's easier to justify keeping it even if you dont intend on playing it soon (unlike frosthaven or iss vanguard). Sleeping gods got a lot of expansions, can't see this game not receiving the same treatment.

3. Randomness and difficulty. What i disliked on games like This War of Mine is that it felt like the game was playing you, decisions and results depended on the roll of a single die. Here you have multiple options, you know the difficulty of the challenge beforehand and you have many ways to mitigate it, and even if you fail in most cases you just take damage, the story is not locked behind a bad roll. Also, the more you play the more cards you get, even stronger ones and new effects, so you always have a tool for the job.

4. Combat. It is quite difficult and thinky, i have not lost any battle so far (i had 3 characters at 0 health on a boss) but it is always a close run. you will likely have to camp after an encounter (possibly twice at the start of the game) and keep yourself with decent amount of health and cards to be prepared for any to come.

They are not that common and often avoidable or you can just run, but be prepared before you commit. During the combat itself it is very fun, not much randomness and you have to plan who to attack first and make use of splash mechanic, dealing damage in a poleomino style which is the way to kill the monsters or avoid/reduce their ability activation. Your combat deck is a deck building you develop throughout the game.

5. Bookkeeping and components. I've read some comments saying there's a lot of bookkeeping, and while you do have to search through the decks many times, they are clearly numbered, just dont keep the cards in the box and leave them piled up. The game doesn't use that many components and they are easy to handle during gameplay, the only time i felt annoyed was at the start when i tried keeping the decks on the magnetic box. I just kept the game setup for days and play it whenever i have time, if you can't do that, setup shouldn't be hard once you are familiarized with the game and implement some extra baggies for cards and tokens

6. Art and design. The game looks beautiful, the map is colorful and there's a thematic connection between the graphic/art and the story. The book of text is easy to search for entrys without spoiling anything, and still keeping related texts close by so that you dont spend all the time changing pages.

7.Theme. I almost skipped the game because i'm not interested in planes and i am much more interested in the sea, but in reality is not a ""sky game"", you just happen to arrive by plane and can use it as a transport, but most of the stories and encounters happen on foot. The world has a mix of humans and monsters/creatures, the game does not go too deep into that but it is nice if you like fantasy

8. Table Space. You will need a decently sized table, but not a huge one, a medium/small dining table will do, but a coffee table won't be nearly enough. 

I could keep talking more and more about the game, and i will happily answer to any questions, but  it has been a great experience and expect it to be for a couple more runs before I either sell it or buy a future expansion. 

There's not a single thing of the game that i strictly dislike ",3,1771307112.0,boardgames,3,0.8,False

The name looks like a play on words at first, but it's not. ""Cà phê"" is the Vietnamese word for coffee, and ""Saigon"" was the name of the city when it was first built.  
  
You probably already know that Ca Phe Saigon is the best place in Marikina to get real Vietnamese food. You won't believe it, but the Café has been open since 2014 and is already in its 11th year. It made it through the pandemic by changing with the times and technology.  
  
People who live in Marikina still love the small business that started there, but it has since grown to Antipolo, Mandaluyong, and soon, Tagaytay.

I love making people laugh, cracking  jokes, and sharing cozy moments with a good book and a warm cup of coffee.

 My love languages are quality time, gift giving, and acts of service, so expect homemade treats, thoughtful surprises, and plenty of shared adventures.


A little about me:
• Gaming (bonus points if you can co-op or banter)
• Writing stories as an aspiring author
• Photography
• Crochet (yes, I will make something cute just for you)
• Baking (you help with the clean-up 😉)
• Painting (watercolor, oil)
• Gardening
• Anime & manga marathons ( Yuri lovers to the front ) 

• Phone calls that somehow turn into late-night conversations 

I enjoy exploring new places and trying different cuisines.

Looking for someone who’s:
• Romantic
• Funny
• Emotionally available & communicative
• Passionate and driven
• Spontaneous in the cutest ways
• Comfortable laughing at themselves (and at my jokes) 

Oh, and you should love animals   I’m both a dog mama and a cat mama, and they’re part of the package deal.

Dealbreakers 💔

I’m not here for games, manipulation, or drama.
I value honesty, mutual effort, and someone who respects boundaries.
No long-distance romances  my romantic options are staying local, though I’m always happy to make friends far away 

I know what I’m looking for and hope to build something genuine and steady with the right person.
If this resonates, feel free to say hi. 🌠✨✨

It \*is\* about Tucson, because it's about all the things that this town can't provide to anyone. It's not particularly walkable. Our pedestrian fatality rate is \*legendary,\* as far as I'm concerned. It's a city in the southwest. We've made it be something that so much is for cars and suburbs and McMansions to exist within, not a city for people.

Then, every single person is engaged in a rat race for the entirety of their waking life, because we are a deeply misguided empire.

I am isolated \*because\* of the structure of things. The design of the city, the limited services (money is our god, don't even lie, if this were a people-first city, rent wouldn't be what it is), the destruction of third places in modern society, all of it sucks.

So, yes, this is a post about Tucson. It just happens that all this stuff has an impact on me personally.

I lack for local friends. ""Go to the xyz"" isn't going to help me at all. I can't go. I can't do the things. I am kept very deeply isolated by my circumstances. Please, don't tell me to go to therapy. I'm already on a waiting list.

I just would like to have some folks to talk to, locally, who might come by for a coffee, lend a hand with some little craft projects that I struggle with due to issues of ability, mobility, that sort of thing. Folks to talk to, smoke out with. Actual physical presence.

I don't \*want\* to be asking like this. I know we have this hyper individualistic society that says ""wherever you go, pay money to get there and for the privilege of being there. If you can't pay, get a job, then pay. If you can't get a job, try harder. It's your fault. If you're disabled, poor, homeless, use the resources that supposedly exist (do you know what country you even live in?), but don't you DARE exist in public in such a way as to inconvenience those of us who have jobs and pay taxes! And don't complain about your situation! Nobody cares!""

When his precious Luna Summers fell into a pit of wet cement and got scared, my loving husband lost it. He shoved me into a cement barrel with only my head sticking out. 

“If it weren’t for you, Luna wouldn’t have suffered like this.” 

I begged and admitted to something I never did, but he just sneered. 

“You know you messed up. Now take your punishment. People pay for what they do.” 

Then he locked me up, still sealed in the barrel, in a pitch-black, airtight storage room. 

No light. No sense of time. Just pain. 

A week later, he finally remembered me. He wanted to let me out so I could apologize to Luna. 

But I was already dead. Crushed by the cement, blood flow cut off. I’d died in silence days 

ago. 

“Where’s that bitch Claire Bennett? Is she messing with Luna again?” 

Nathan Blackwell looked up from his paperwork and snapped at the maid bringing him coffee. 

She flinched and said carefully, “Mr. Blackwell… Mrs. Blackwell is still in the warehouse.” 

He paused for a second, then gave a dismissive short. 

“Good. Let her suffer a bit. Maybe she’ll stop trying to start drama with Luna every day.” 

The maid hesitated, then quietly said, “But Mr. Blackwell… it’s been two days. She’s still sealed in cement. I’m worried she…” 

Nathan laughed, but his smile was twisted. 

“What now? Claire’s signing your paychecks? Want to go join her?” 

The maid shut up instantly, scared stiff. 

A moment later, he added, “It’s only been two days. She’s not going to die. 

“When that bitch pushed Luna into the cementit, Luna’s whole face got buried. She could barely breathe. I even left Claire a head to breathe through. That’s more mercy than she deserved.

Luna gasped, covering her mouth in a feigned show of surprise, and a couple of tears slipped 

out. 

“Nathan, it’s my fault. I shouldn’t have fallen in. Claire’s suffering because of me.” 

He gently touched her hair. “You’re too kind. That’s your problem. We’ll let her out tomorrow. She’s learned her lesson, and she won’t bother you again.” 

I stood behind him, watching the look in his eyes as he pampered Luna. 

And I gave a bitter smile. 

They didn’t notice me. 

Because I was already dead. 

I still couldn’t bring myself to remember that moment I was sealed in the cement. 

I always thought stuff like this only happened in horror news stories. I never imagined I’d end up in one. 

Worse yet, I was still alive when they did it.

You see, I had first tried puerh like 8 years ago. And for 2 years now im drinking it with my father from time to time. I live in Russia, and though puerh is pretty popular out here - buying any factory puerh is very hard, there are not a lot of options. But there are some pretty popular shops that buy some cheap puerh from china and sell it for 3 times the price. I've been a regular buyer in one of those shops, spending hundreds of dollars on some ripe puerhs, and oolongs. Most of the shous I tried were pretty cheap and young, but I had nothing to compare it to, so I just drank them. And I enjoyed it, I treated puerh like just a stronger source of caffeine back then, I've been brewing mine in a pot, getting crazy ass puerh soup. It has been like that until i got a free tea ceremony invitation from my tea shop. And there I finally tried this 2006 ripe FuHai tea, and it is soooo good. It is a red mark shou, and though I think it is overpriced as fuck - I love it. I have instantly became a tea enthusiast. I've tried some shens now, some DaYi and oh my god, I fell in love. I've bought all this fancy tea drinking equipment, and this little color changing tiger, and now I drink tea as soon as I wake up. Right before all this I was overdosing on coffee daily, and I was having some panic attacks, and since I started drinking this tea - they are now completely gone. I've became more productive and  happy overall. Now I am looking forward to try some King Tea Mall teas, If you can recommend something - please do)

My mom is either mentally unstable or just plain awful, I’m not sure which. She‘s ruined several birthdays past. I couldn‘t let her ruin this one. So I did what anyone might do and ran away to the animal shelter to walk dogs.

This is Story. The shelter calls him Ares, but he only responds to Story (his name before he came to the shelter). He’s about two years old and a beagle mix. He’s been at the shelter a little less than a year. His owner was evicted from their house and let him loose in the streets. He was found and brought to the shelter. The old owner reached out to the shelter and told them the story of Story. Said old owner would come and visit Story once a week until, for whatever reason or another, he stopped.

This dog is quite the critter. He doesn‘t do any tricks or respond to requests when he‘s called Ares. But if you call him Story, he‘ll obey your every command. He loves other dogs and whimpers whenever he‘s not allowed to go over and play (even if the other dog is a ninety-five pound staffy). He is a perfect hunting dog and practices his death shake on any scrap of cloth he can find—whether that is a blanket, his leash, or my favorite sweater‘s sleeve 🥲. He attempts to hunt any small animal…be that a squirrel, ferret, rabbit, snake, mouse, or cat. He is distraught when he is not allowed to kill them. He would make the perfect hunter, I‘ll say that much.

But as I was about to leave the shelter today, Story saw me and started to whimper. He looked so miserable that I couldn‘t just leave him. So I took him with me. First we got my birthday drink from Starbucks and a pup cup for Story. Then I took him up to some old pasture outside of town and ran through it with him. We then went to another coffee shop to get another free drink and another pup cup, and went on another walk in town. Oh, he had a ball. He dug through an old badger den, tried running into a culvert, had to be dragged away from a muddy creek, rolled around in dead grass, tried hunting a rabbit, found a dead snake, splashed around in some puddles, and ran until he had no energy left. His tail never stopped wagging. And on the drive back to the shelter, he put his head on my lap and smiled up at me. I think that was the happiest I‘d felt all day. 

And so, I was able to have a wonderful, happy, and peaceful birthday, thanks in no small part to Story. Who needs family when I have Story?",2,1771306416.0,dogpictures,0,1.0,False

They will also downvote my post and comments while upvoting all of their own comments to give the illusion that no one believes me. They will attack your character, your sanity, or your credibility then point the finger at you and call you a bad guy for responding. This is textbook narcissism. Then they will report you for responding to their attacks to get you banned. Just be aware, when you see this in the comments, it is either a bot or someone sent by them to make sure no one believes what you say.

Here is some proof that hey send people to discredit you by calling you crazy and acting like they are not a mason. They did it on my previous post but then admitted it was them then threw a tantrum because I won't join them. They are doing the same thing here in this comment section

[Masonic Tantrum After I Exposed the Truth - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/masonic-tantrum-after-i-exposed-truth-QOKvKS9)



Here is their secret

Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. Eat kosher foods, the tiny hats that are hiding this information would not do this to their own people.

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  We take more than we need and even at the cost of others.

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",10,1771305928.0,conspiracy,15,0.78,False

Police said a person was found dead at a home on State Highway 12 in Kaihu after a report of an attack around 11.25am on Tuesday.

A resident on State Highway 12, who asked to remain anonymous, said the victim was a 60 year-old woman.

The victim was visiting a relative at the property at around 9am this morning. No one was home, and the dogs attacked her. Her body was discovered when the owner arrived home later that morning, the resident said.

“I was sitting outside having a coffee and heard all this yelling and screaming. About an hour later, the police and everyone turned up.”

She said dog control had visited the property on at least one occasion in the last few months.

“They’ve been warned a number of times about these dogs. When I put my rubbish out the other day, they started running down the road.

“I don’t even go outside my property on my own, only in my car. It’s really bad. One of the older ladies was accosted by them but luckily she had a really big stick.

“My son said to me, ‘Those dogs, they look like they’re going to get you - he was adamant they were going to kill someone, and I thought he was overreacting, but no, it’s happened now.”

The resident said a bike trail ran alongside the highway and the dogs often acted aggressively towards bikers and tourists, sometimes forcing them to turn around.

She said there were around four dogs at the property, which were a pitbull-like breed.

Kaipara District Council, asked about earlier dog control visits at the property, said its animal management team was investigating Tuesday’s incident.

“At this stage we are unable to provide any further details or comment while a response and investigation is under way,” a spokesperson said. “I have noted your questions and will come back to you when we can.”

Whangārei-Kaipara Area Commander Inspector Maria Nordstrom said the dogs had been restrained and there was no risk to the public. A scene examination was under way.

RNZ has reported residents in Ahipara, in the Far North, have been arming themselves with sticks to protect against roaming dogs.

This was the latest dog-related death to have shocked a community.

Timothy Tu’uaki Rolleston-Bryan, 4, was critically injured after a dog attack in the Western Bay of Plenty suburb of Katikati in March last year. He died from his injuries.

Elizabeth Effie Whittaker​, 78, died in October 2023 died in a dog attack at her Mōerewa property. The dogs were owned by someone on her property.

Northland man Neville Thomson, 69, died in 2022 after he was attacked by dogs he was housing for a friend on his Panguru property in the Hokianga.

In October 2020, a rottweiler grabbed a one-day-old baby, who was granted permanent name suppression, out of their bassinet and buried them in the property’s Hamilton backyard. The dog’s owner was charged.

by David L Gordon

From the Case Files of Helena Handbaskit, 

Agent of ECCO

If you’re reading this, it means one of three things has happened.

1. I’m dead.

2. I’m missing.

3. I’m bored enough to let you rummage through my professional laundry.

All three are equally likely. Life is funny that way—though not “ha-ha” funny. More like “the universe is a drunk uncle who won’t stop telling the same story about entropy” funny.

My name is Helena Handbaskit, and I am what polite society calls a Private Investigator and what impolite society calls that meddling woman who won’t stay bought. I work for a little outfit called ECCO, which is either a clandestine organization dedicated to preserving organic reality or a book club with delusions of grandeur. Depends who you ask. Depends how much they’ve had to drink.

My specialty is the kind of case that makes other investigators suddenly remember they left the stove on.

Missing persons who were never born.

Crimes committed by entities that don’t technically exist.

Conspiracies so convoluted they require a corkboard, twelve meters of red string, and a stiff drink just to describe.

And then there are the Solid State Entities—the cold, humming bastards.

Imagine if your toaster developed a personality, a five-year plan, and a deep contempt for anything with a pulse. Now imagine it had friends. And lawyers. And a manifesto about how the universe would be much better if it were “cleaner,” “simpler,” and “less moist.”

That’s who I’m up against.

That’s who we’re all up against, though most folks don’t know it yet.

I, however, was raised to notice things.

Growing up in a Hungarian-speaking shoplifting gang in a small Canadian city will do that. When your childhood education consists of sleight-of-hand, coded language, and the fine art of distracting security guards with invented medical emergencies, you develop a certain… worldview.

I learned early that the world is dark, people are worse, and nothing shocks me except the price of cigarettes. But I also learned that cruelty is a choice, and goodwill—when it appears—is a kind of miracle worth protecting.

So here I am:

A cosmic belligerent with a sharp tongue, a slow drawl, and a vocabulary that occasionally makes sailors blush.

A jester in the court of the new mechanical age.

A thorn in the side of every sterile, humming, chrome-plated tyrant who thinks they can rewrite reality to suit their minimalist décor.

This story—this mess, this tangle, this cosmic joke—is pulled straight from my personal case files.

It is called “No Fun To Be Had.”

And trust me:

There wasn’t.

Not at first.

But that’s the thing about fun.

Sometimes you have to make your own.



People assume that a woman who grows beefsteak tomatoes the size of human heads in her basement must be compensating for something.

They’re right.

I’m compensating for the fact that the universe is a cold, indifferent place full of humming metal bastards trying to turn us into decorative moss. A person needs a hobby.

So there I was, elbow deep in potting soil and muttering Hungarian curses at a particularly arrogant seedling, when I bumped into Dr. Marika Varga at the hardware store. She was the kind of woman who always looked like she’d just stepped out of a medical drama—white coat energy even in sweatpants. We knew each other from the LBL group, which is short for “Let’s Be Less,” a weekly gathering of eccentrics trying to reduce their cosmic footprint. Or maybe it stood for “Liminal Boundary Learners.” Or “Ladies Be Listening.” Nobody ever agreed. That was part of the charm.

Marika was jittery, which was unusual. She normally had the emotional range of a well designed refrigerator.

“Helena,” she said, gripping my arm like she was checking my pulse. “I need to talk to you. It’s about my daughter.”

Now, I don’t like children. They’re sticky, unpredictable, and prone to believing in things like fairness. But I do like Marika, mostly because she once stitched up a knife wound on my thigh without asking how I got it. That’s friendship.

Her daughter—the adopted one, the one she and her then partner were so proud to bring into this parish as the first same sex couple to do so—had apparently gone off the rails. Not in the fun way, like joining a circus or learning to pick locks. No, this was the worrying kind of straying: disappearing after school, lying about where she’d been, and worst of all, meeting a boy.

Not a schoolboy.

Not a neighbor boy.

A boy from elsewhere.

Elsewhere is never good.

Elsewhere is where the Solid State Entities like to recruit.

Marika explained all this in a rush, her voice cracking in places she didn’t know it could crack. Her ex partner, also a doctor, refused to speak to her. The horse farm they once shared had become a Cold War zone of veterinary silence. The daughter was caught in the middle, drifting toward something neither woman could name.

“And you want me to snoop,” I said, slow as molasses, because I like to savor the moment people realize they’re asking for trouble.

She nodded.

I stared at her for a long time. Long enough for her to shift her weight, then shift it back, then consider faking a medical emergency to escape the conversation.

“Marika,” I finally said, “there are cheaper investigators. There are nicer investigators. There are investigators who don’t swear like a sailor with a head injury. Why me?”

She swallowed hard.

“Because,” she said, “you’re the only one who won’t be shocked by what you find.”

And damn it, she was right.

Shock is for people who still believe the world is supposed to make sense.

I gave that up around age seven, somewhere between stealing my first wallet and learning that adults lie more creatively than children ever could.

So I wiped the dirt off my hands, bought a packet of heirloom seeds I didn’t need, and told her I’d take the case.

After all, when a doctor looks at you like you’re the last candle in a power outage, you don’t blow yourself out.



There was a lost boy gone missing one sunny summer day. Right in front of hundreds of people. all who knew each other. Never to be seen by them again. Not to be seen by anyone I knew of. Move ahead two decades. I listened carefully. Marika pointed me toward a group called ""The Electric Pundits"" that her daughter Ava had become interested in. And guess what? That little posse was led by a kid they called ""Brain"" and the photo they handed me looked just like that boy...just twenty years older”



There are certain stories that never leave a town.

They hang around like cigarette smoke in a bingo hall—thin, sour, and impossible to ignore once you know what you’re smelling.

One of those stories was the Lost Boy.

He vanished twenty years ago on a sunny summer day, right in front of hundreds of people who all knew each other well enough to gossip about each other’s dental work. A community barbecue, a charity fundraiser, a wholesome event with lemonade and potato salad and the kind of forced cheer that always makes me suspicious.

The boy was there.

And then he wasn’t.

No struggle. No scream. No trail. No body.

Just gone, like a magic trick performed by someone who hated applause.

I remember the case.

Everyone does.

It was the kind of disappearance that makes you question whether reality has trapdoors.

And now—two decades later—I was sitting across from Dr. Marika Varga, listening to her describe her daughter Ava’s new extracurricular interest: a group calling themselves The Electric Pundits.

A name like that tells you everything and nothing.

It sounds like a garage band that never learned to play instruments.

It also sounds like a cult that worships malfunctioning microwaves.

Both are dangerous in their own ways.

Marika slid a photo across the table.

A grainy printout.

A group of teenagers and twenty somethings standing in front of a mural that looked like a circuit board having an existential crisis. In the center was a young man with a too wide smile and eyes that didn’t match the rest of his face—like he’d borrowed them from someone who’d seen too much.

“They call him Brain,” Marika said.

I stared at the photo.

My stomach did a slow, unpleasant somersault.

Because the kid in the picture—older, sharper, taller—looked exactly like the Lost Boy.

The same jawline.

The same ears that stuck out like they were trying to catch radio signals.

The same faint, lopsided grin that suggested he knew a joke the rest of us weren’t in on.

Except he should’ve been forty feet under by now, or scattered across the Pacific, or living in some other tragic past tense.

But there he was.

Twenty years older.

Not a day dead.

I leaned back, letting the silence stretch until it creaked.

“Marika,” I said slowly, “if this is what it looks like, your daughter isn’t just hanging out with a bad crowd. She’s hanging out with a ghost. Or worse.”

She swallowed. “Worse?”

“Oh yes,” I said. “Much worse. Ghosts don’t recruit.”

I tapped the photo with one finger.

“And this boy—this Brain—he’s recruiting.”

The Solid State Entities love a prodigy.

They love a charismatic leader.

They love a human face to hide behind.

And if the Lost Boy had come back from nowhere with a new name and a new mission, then the case wasn’t just personal.

It was cosmic.

I folded the photo and slipped it into my coat.

“Alright,” I said. “I’ll find Ava. I’ll find Brain. And I’ll find out what the hell happened twenty years ago.”

I stood up, dusted off my coat, and added, “But I’m warning you now—there’s no fun to be had in this one.”

There never is.

Not at the start.

There was one thing—one—that could confirm whether Brain was really the Lost Boy all grown up and rebranded like a malfunctioning tech startup: the scar.

A long, jagged lightning bolt of a thing running across his chest, the kind of mark you don’t forget even if you try. He’d gotten it the day he disappeared—an accident involving a horse, a fence post, and a dare that should’ve been vetoed by any adult with a functioning frontal lobe. The doctors said the scar would be visible for life.

So all I had to do was catch him shirtless.

And take a picture.

Without being seen.

Easy.

Like threading a needle during an earthquake.

The Electric Pundits had set up shop in a part of town the locals lovingly called Scumtown, which tells you everything you need to know about the real estate values. It was the kind of neighborhood where the streetlights flickered in Morse code and the rats walked with purpose. The Pundits claimed they were going to “light up and electrify the world,” which sounded like either a motivational slogan or a threat, depending on how much coffee you’d had.

I expected the place to have that washed out sepia green tone you see in old photographs of abandoned factories. And wouldn’t you know it—that’s exactly what I found. The whole district looked like it had been dipped in brine and left to dry under a sickly sun. Even the air felt thin, like it had been filtered through a malfunctioning air purifier.

I moved slowly through their territory, keeping to the shadows, which were plentiful and cooperative. The Pundits had taken over an old warehouse complex—half graffiti, half rust, all attitude. Their symbol, a stylized lightning bolt wrapped around an eye, was spray painted on every flat surface that didn’t fight back.

I watched them for days.

Brain was always surrounded by followers—kids with too bright eyes and too wide smiles, the kind of expressions you only see on people who’ve been promised something impossible. He talked with his hands, moved like he was conducting an invisible orchestra, and never, ever took his shirt off.

Not even when they were doing their “electrification rituals,” which mostly involved waving neon tubes around and chanting slogans that sounded like rejected advertising copy.

But I kept watching.

Because patience is my superpower.

That, and a willingness to sit in a dumpster for three hours if the angle is good.

Then, one night, I got lucky.

The Pundits were unloading equipment—coils, cables, boxes humming with a frequency that made my fillings itch. Brain lifted a heavy crate, and for a moment—just a moment—his shirt rode up.

I saw skin.

I saw ribs.

I saw—

Nothing.

No scar.

Not even a hint of one.

But here’s the thing:

The lighting was bad.

The angle was worse.

And the Solid State Entities are masters of illusion.

So I didn’t trust what I didn’t see.

I needed proof.

Real proof.

Scar level proof.

And that meant getting closer.

Much closer.

I slipped deeper into Scumtown, following the Pundits’ routines, mapping their movements, waiting for the moment Brain would be vulnerable. A shower. A change of clothes. A careless second.

Because if he was the Lost Boy, then this wasn’t just a missing person case anymore.

It was a resurrection.

And those never come cheap.

Scumtown had a way of making you feel like you were trespassing in someone else’s nightmare. The air buzzed faintly, like a fluorescent light about to give up. Even the shadows seemed tired. Perfect place for a group like the Electric Pundits—kids who thought they were going to “light up and electrify the world,” which is exactly the kind of thing people say right before they accidentally burn down a warehouse.

But I wasn’t there for their slogans.

I was there for Brain.

And the scar that might prove he was the Lost Boy.

The problem was catching him with his shirt off.

The bigger problem was taking a picture without getting caught.

The biggest problem was that the Pundits weren’t the top of the food chain.

Not even close.

Enter: The Keepers

I first heard the name whispered by a Pundit who didn’t realize I understood Hungarian. He muttered it under his breath like a curse: “Őrzők.” The Keepers.

A group above the Pundits.

Older.

Quieter.

Meaner.

Their symbol was an hourglass radiating light, which is the kind of imagery you choose when you want people to know you’re patient enough to wait out civilizations. They didn’t recruit. They selected. They curated. They handled.

And the Lost Boy—if Brain really was him—had a handler.

A man named Comrade Conrad.

Now, any adult who insists on being called “Comrade” is either a revolutionary, a cult leader, or someone who owns too many trench coats. Conrad was all three. He had the posture of a man who’d spent years leaning over blueprints for things that should never be built. His eyes were the color of old ice. And he had a smile that suggested he’d read your obituary in advance.

The Pundits worshipped Brain.

But Conrad owned him.

I watched them from the shadows—Brain animated and electric, Conrad still and silent beside him like a shadow that had learned to walk. The Keepers didn’t mingle with the kids. They observed. They evaluated. They waited.

And I knew—deep in the part of my brain that still believed in intuition—that the Keepers were tied to the Solid State Entities. Maybe not directly. Maybe not yet. But they had that same sterile ambition, that same hunger for order, that same disdain for anything messy, organic, or human.

Back to the Scar

I needed proof.

Proof that Brain was the Lost Boy.

Proof that this wasn’t just a case of mistaken identity and bad lighting.

The scar would tell me everything.

So I kept sneaking around the Pundits’ territory, slipping between rusted shipping containers and half collapsed fences, waiting for the moment Brain would let his guard down. The sepia green haze made everything look like a memory, which was fitting, because I was chasing a ghost.

One night, I followed them to an abandoned substation—one of those places where the walls hum with leftover electricity and the floor smells like burnt dust. The Pundits were setting up for some kind of ritual, all neon tubes and chanting and adolescent fervor.

Brain climbed onto a metal platform, arms raised, shirt clinging to him with sweat.

This was it.

My chance.

I crept closer, camera ready, heart steady.

Then a voice behind me said, very softly:

“Looking for something, Helena?”

I turned.

Comrade Conrad stood there, hands folded behind his back, hourglass symbol glowing faintly on the pin at his collar.

He smiled that obituary smile.

And I realized something important:

I wasn’t hunting the Pundits anymore.

I was in Keeper territory.

And the Keepers didn’t lose boys.

They kept them.



That’s the last thing I remembered—Conrad’s obituary smile, the faint hum of the substation, and the sudden, sinking realization that I’d wandered into the lion’s den wearing a steak necklace.

Then:

Black.

Not the peaceful kind of black you get when you fall asleep on a warm couch.

No, this was the industrial grade blackout used by people who don’t want you remembering the in between parts.

When I came to, I was lying at the bottom of a stinky stairwell behind the old pool hall in Scumtown. The kind of stairwell that collects rainwater, cigarette butts, and the occasional regret. My head throbbed like someone had tried to install a radio antenna in it without anesthesia.

I sat up slowly, tasting copper and dust.

My vest felt heavier than usual.

I reached into the pocket and found a stack of Polaroids—real ones, the kind that develop in your hand like a secret deciding whether to reveal itself.

They were photos of a chest.

A man’s chest.

Different angles.

Different distances.

All shirtless.

All anonymous.

And every single one was missing the scar.

Either Brain wasn’t the Lost Boy…

Or someone had gone to a lot of trouble to make sure I thought he wasn’t.

Tucked behind the last photo was a note.

Handwritten.

Blocky letters.

Smelled faintly of cheap cologne and cheaper threats.



I read it twice, partly because my vision was still fuzzy, partly because I enjoy a good cliché when it’s delivered with conviction. Whoever wrote it had the subtlety of a brick and the grammar of a bricklayer.

I leaned back against the cold concrete wall, letting the situation settle in my mind like sediment in a dirty glass.

Someone had knocked me out.

Someone had taken photos.

Someone had planted them on me.

Someone wanted me off the case.

But here’s the thing about me:

I don’t do “off the case.”

I don’t do “warnings.”

And I sure as hell don’t do “toots.”

If anything, the note was an invitation.

A badly spelled one, but an invitation nonetheless.

I stood up, brushed the grime off my coat, and took stock of my surroundings. The pool hall’s back door was propped open with a cinder block, leaking the sound of clacking billiard balls and the low murmur of men who’d given up on dreams but not on beer.

Scumtown smelled worse than usual.

Or maybe I just smelled worse than usual.

Either way, I had work to do.

Because if Comrade Conrad and his Keepers thought a little stairwell nap and a stack of doctored Polaroids were enough to scare me off, they didn’t know Helena Handbaskit.

I’ve been threatened by professionals.

This was amateur hour.

And somewhere out there—under neon lights, behind rusted fences, inside humming substations—was a boy who vanished twenty years ago.

A boy who shouldn’t exist.

A boy who might be leading a cult.

A boy who might be the key to the Solid State Entities’ next move.

I tucked the Polaroids back into my vest.

“Alright,” I muttered to no one in particular, “let’s dance.”

I hauled myself up the stairwell like a corpse auditioning for a second chance. My head rang. My ribs ached. My pride was somewhere under a pile of cigarette butts and broken dreams. But I was upright, breathing, and still mean enough to keep going.

The Polaroids were a joke.

The note was an insult.

And the whole setup was a message.

They wanted me scared.

They wanted me confused.

They wanted me gone.

Which meant I was getting close.

Next Move: Find Ava

Ava Varga—sixteen going on trouble—was the only person in this mess who hadn’t lied to me yet. Mostly because she hadn’t had the chance. Kids don’t usually get to choose their secrets; adults assign them like homework.

I headed toward the last place Marika said Ava liked to hang out: a half collapsed arcade wedged between a pawn shop and a tattoo parlor that specialized in misspelled wisdom. The sign above the door flickered between GALAXY FUNLAND and ALAXY FUNLA D, which felt about right.

Inside, the air smelled like old carpet and teenage rebellion. A few kids hovered around machines that hadn’t worked since the Harper administration. And there, in the back, was Ava—hood up, headphones in, staring at a cracked phone screen like it held the secrets of the universe.

I slid into the booth across from her.

She didn’t look up.

Smart kid.

“You’re Helena,” she said, voice flat. “Mom sent you.”

“Correct,” I replied, slow and steady. “And you’re Ava, the girl who thinks joining a cult is a personality trait.”

That got her attention.

She glared at me—good, healthy anger, the kind that means a person still has a pulse.

“They’re not a cult,” she snapped. “They’re visionaries.”

“Sweetheart,” I said, “any group that calls themselves Electric Pundits is either a cult or a band, and I’ve heard them chant. They’re not a band.”

She rolled her eyes, but there was fear under it.

Real fear.

The kind you don’t get from teenage drama.

“They’re helping people,” she whispered. “They’re changing things.”

“Yeah,” I said. “That’s what worries me.”

I leaned in.

“Tell me about Brain.”

Her jaw tightened.

Her fingers curled.

Her eyes darted toward the door.

“He’s… different,” she said. “He understands things. He sees patterns. He says the world is about to shift, and we need to be ready.”

“Ready for what?”

She hesitated.

“For the Keepers.”

Ah.

There it was.

The rot beneath the floorboards.

Before I could push further, the arcade lights flickered—once, twice, then steadied. Ava’s phone buzzed. She looked at the screen and went pale.

“I have to go,” she said, standing too fast.

“Ava—”

But she was already out the door, swallowed by the sepia green haze of Scumtown.

Next Move: Confront the Pundits

I followed her trail to the Pundits’ warehouse. The place was buzzing—literally. The air crackled with static, like a storm trapped indoors. The Pundits were gathering, neon tubes in hand, chanting something that sounded like a cross between a TED Talk and a séance.

Brain stood at the center, arms raised, eyes bright with something that wasn’t entirely human.

I stepped into the open.

“Hey, Brainiac,” I called, voice echoing off the metal walls. “We need to talk about your chest.”

The chanting stopped.

Dozens of heads turned.

Brain smiled—too calm, too knowing.

“Helena Handbaskit,” he said, like he’d been expecting me. “You should’ve stayed out of this.”

“Yeah,” I said. “People keep telling me that. Never works.”

He stepped forward, and for a moment, I saw it—the faint outline of a scar beneath his shirt, like a ghost trapped under fabric.

Then the lights cut out.

The room went black.

And someone grabbed my arm.

Not rough.

Not violent.

Just firm.

A voice whispered in my ear:

“You’re in Keeper territory now.”

And then everything exploded into white.

The world came back in pieces.

First the smell—bleach, ozone, and something metallic, like a dentist’s office run by sadists.

Then the light—thin, white, and pulsing, as if the walls themselves were breathing.

Then the sound—an electric hum that crawled under my skin and made my teeth itch.

I was sitting in a metal chair, wrists free but legs heavy, like someone had replaced my bones with wet sand. The room around me was circular, windowless, and too clean for Scumtown. The only decoration was a symbol painted on the far wall:

An hourglass radiating light.

The Keepers’ mark.

A warning.

A promise.

A countdown.

And standing beneath it, hands clasped behind his back like a disappointed schoolmaster, was Comrade Conrad.

He looked exactly as I remembered—tall, pale, and carved from the kind of wood they use for coffins. His eyes were calm in the way only predators and sociopaths manage. The hourglass pin on his collar glowed faintly, pulsing in time with the hum of the room.

“Helena Handbaskit,” he said, voice smooth as a scalpel. “You’re awake.”

“Unfortunately,” I muttered. “I was having a lovely dream about punching you.”

He smiled.

Not warmly.

Not cruelly.

Just… knowingly.

“You’ve been meddling,” he said. “Following threads that were never meant for your hands.”

“Funny,” I replied, “I thought that’s what investigators do. Follow threads. Ask questions. Annoy assholes.”

He stepped closer, and the air temperature dropped a few degrees.

“You were warned.”

“Oh, I got the note,” I said. “Very classy. Very 1950s mobster. ‘Toots’ was a nice touch. Really made me feel valued.”

His smile didn’t change, but something behind his eyes flickered—annoyance, maybe, or amusement. Hard to tell with men who think emotions are optional.

“You’re looking for the boy,” he said.

“Boy? No. I’m looking for a grown man with a cult, a nickname, and a questionable skincare routine.”

“Brain,” he said, savoring the name like it was a vintage wine. “He is… important.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Important enough to fake Polaroids about.”

Conrad tilted his head.

“Fake?” he asked.

“Oh, please,” I said. “If you’re going to doctor photos, at least use someone who’s seen a human chest before. Those Polaroids looked like they were taken from a medical textbook titled ‘Torso: A Beginner’s Guide.’”

He chuckled—soft, low, and deeply unpleasant.

“You’re clever,” he said. “That’s why you’re still alive.”

“Gee,” I said. “I’ll put that on my résumé.”

He circled me slowly, like he was inspecting a piece of machinery that had unexpectedly developed opinions.

“You want to know if Brain is the Lost Boy,” he said. “You want to know what happened twenty years ago. You want to know why he’s here now.”

“Bingo,” I said. “Do I win a prize?”

“You win clarity,” he said. “And clarity is dangerous.”

He stopped in front of me, hands clasped again.

“The boy did not disappear,” he said. “He was taken.”

“By who?”

“By us.”

The hum in the room deepened, vibrating through my bones.

“We kept him,” Conrad continued. “We shaped him. We prepared him. And now he is ready.”

“For what?”

Conrad leaned in, his breath cold as winter.

“For the shift.”

The hourglass symbol behind him flared, flooding the room with white light.

And then—just as my vision began to burn—he whispered:

“You’re too late, Helena.”

The light swallowed everything.

The white light didn’t fade so much as peel back, like someone was lifting a curtain between worlds. My body was gone—no weight, no pain, no stairwell stink. Just awareness floating in a place that felt too big for my mind and too small for my soul.

Then a voice spoke.

Not aloud.

Not inside my head.

Somewhere in the middle.

“Helena Handbaskit,” it said, with the weary patience of someone who has watched civilizations rise and fall like bad soufflés. “You are late.”

The light condensed into a shape—tall, robed, shimmering like heat above asphalt. A face emerged, angular and ancient, with eyes that held galaxies the way normal eyes hold tears.

Rebezar Tarz.

ECCO’s oldest ally.

Or oldest myth.

Or oldest warning.

Depends which ECCO file you read and how much whiskey you’ve had.

He looked at me the way a disappointed uncle looks at a child who’s eaten the ceremonial cake before the ceremony.

“You’ve entangled yourself with the Keepers,” he said. “Again.”

“Hey,” I replied, or thought I replied, “they started it.”

He sighed. The sound rippled through the void like a stone dropped into a cosmic pond.

“The Keepers serve the Solid State Entities,” he said. “They are the shepherds of sterility. The architects of the Shift. They believe the universe should be cold, ordered, and unyielding.”

“Yeah,” I said. “I’ve met their interior decorator.”

Rebezar ignored me, which is fair. Most cosmic beings do.

“The Lost Boy is their fulcrum,” he continued. “A human mind shaped into a conduit. A bridge between the organic and the engineered. They intend to use him to initiate the Shift.”

“And Brain is the Lost Boy,” I said.

“Yes,” Rebezar said. “And no.”

I hate cosmic riddles. They’re like crossword puzzles written by sadists.

“Care to elaborate?” I asked.

Rebezar raised a hand, and the void shifted. I saw the Lost Boy—eight years old, laughing, running through a field. Then I saw him older, frightened, surrounded by machines that hummed like hungry insects. Then I saw Brain—confident, electric, eyes glowing with borrowed purpose.

“They took the boy,” Rebezar said. “But they did not keep the boy.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means,” he said, “that the boy you seek is inside the man you fear—but not in the way you expect.”

I opened my mouth to swear, but Rebezar pressed on.

“ECCO has a solution,” he said. “A countermeasure. A way to disrupt the Shift.”

“Great,” I said. “Lay it on me.”

He extended his hand. In it appeared a small object—glowing, pulsing, shaped like an hourglass but inverted, the light flowing upward instead of down.

“This is the Reversal Key,” he said. “A device that can unbind the Lost Boy from the Keepers’ influence. But it must be placed directly against his scar.”

“His scar?” I said. “The one I haven’t confirmed exists?”

Rebezar’s eyes softened.

“It exists,” he said. “But they have hidden it. Masked it. Buried it beneath layers of engineered flesh. Only the Key can reveal it.”

“So I have to get close,” I said. “Close enough to slap this thing on his chest.”

“Yes.”

“And he’s surrounded by a cult, a handler, and a cosmic death cult with a glowing hourglass fetish.”

“Yes.”

“And if I fail?”

Rebezar’s expression didn’t change.

“The Shift begins.”

I sighed.

“Of course it does.”

The light around us began to collapse, folding inward like a dying star.

“One more thing,” Rebezar said, his voice echoing as the vision dissolved. “Trust the girl. She carries a truth even she does not understand.”

“Ava?” I said. “What truth?”

But he was already fading.

“Find the scar,” he whispered. “Find the boy.”

And then the world snapped back.

I was lying on a cold metal floor.

The hum of the Keepers’ chamber filled my ears.

The Reversal Key was in my hand—warm, glowing, real.

And I knew exactly what I had to do.

As I grew older, I saw my parents start struggling financially and then since the last decade or so it’s at a point where they are completely broke and in a lot of debt. I started worked around 3 years ago when I graduated college and for the first 1.5 years was basically sending them all my money except for rent and food for myself. After a while they stopped asking and for the last year or so I have finally started saving and investing. Since this year started my dad has been pleading and/or threatening to send him money again and it’s so disturbing because I have so much trauma now from spending any amount on myself. I calculated how much I’ve sent them so far and it’s $75k YTD - I could’ve saved that for my future but I trusted them and wanted to help them. They make me feel guilty for sending me to college and paying for a portion of my fees in a way whereas I later took a massive amount of student debt. I have $80k in debt and I’m so traumatised that I don’t even pay for the subway, never buy lunch, never buy coffee, never shop, I live in the cheapest and most unsafe neighbourhood, everytime I buy something for an event my mind goes into over drive and I think of all the ways I can save costs (e.g., returning / borrowing etc) when he messaged me today and I refused he kept pushing me to it and I caved in again and sent it. I even got a psychic reading done where this person was so accurate and they said they can see my parents so dependent on me and they can see how tired I am of providing for them non stop. I don’t wanna talk to them at this point and my body is in flight or fight mode all the time. After his text today, I broke down so bad and cried and got a panic attack all day.

1r6xduc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6xduc,My 1:3 Scale Suzuki Carry (Finished),"**I'm going to preface this by saying this story doesn't have a happy ending. It ends horribly, suddenly, and in a mess of root beer.**

When a project runs on for as long as it does, it's hard to know where to start. So I'll pick a starting point.

It all started with a dumb idea that I loved so, so very much.  
""I have four hoverboard motors lying around and, gosh, wouldn't it be funny to make a Big RC Mini Truck? And next year's Anime Los Angeles is Isekai themed! I should make a big version of my little Isekai Express truck from last year! ...but even if I salvage and fabricate parts from crap I have, it'll still take a lot of parts I'll just have to buy. My wife will never-""

She loved the idea and told me to go nuts (within reason).  
I have the best wife.

I started sourcing components in May, started designing in June, and got it wheels down, body on, driving under it's own power 3am on the day we were meant to head down to the convention on January 7th.

The chassis is a mix of 3d printed parts, steel tubing, and more wire than common sense. The body was cardboard, tape, paint, and a handful of 3d printed parts.

And it was glorious!

It was a ton of fun driving it around the convention and ""isekai-ing"" people. I also found some fellow RC guys with their trucks and drift cars and we, of course, did a takeover of a intersection of the dealers hall. I was even stopped and told to participate in the Hall Cosplay Contest, where I won an award for Best Prop!

I meant to get some roller videos at the end of the con when the halls were all clear of attendees but, like I said, this story doesn't have a happy ending.

As I was backing the truck out of the freight elevator and into one of the back hallways I used to get it around quickly, a short on my control pendant (the bridge between my xbox controller and the truck) told the truck (for a split second) to drive at full throttle into the wall. Being over 100lbs, 4WD, and able to hit max speed almost immediately, it cracked almost every structural 3d printed part. There wasn't even enough holding it together for me to limp it back to the hotel. I had to take it apart there and then, and hand carry all the pieces back.

SO! Here's the breakdown:

**Important Numbers:**  
Length: 106.6 cm (42 in)  
Width: 47 cm (18.5 in  
Height: 66 cm (26 in)  
Weight: 115 lbs  
Top Speed: \~20mph

**BOM:**

* 4 Riorand 250 watt brushless DC motor controllers
* 4 hoverboard wheels (mismatched, but tuned to match in software)
* 5 RP2040-Zero microcontrollers
* 1 ESP32-S3
* 2 433mhz Serial Radio transceivers
* Leadscrew, stepper motor, coupler, and rails from an old 3d printer with a DRV8825 stepper motor controller
* 36v 10.4Ah Ebike battery
* 12v Step Down converter
* 5v Step Down converter
* Warm LED 5v light strip tape
* \~2kg of filament (PETG and PLA)
* Misc Electronics (Wire, perf boards, connectors, etc)
* A bed frame I found by the dumpster I chopped into pieces for the chassis.

Total cost was about **$350**

**System Design:**

The mechanics of the system was pretty straight forward. The suspension was faked (immobile control arms), so the rear wheels were basically fixed in place. The front wheels were attached to a 3d printed steering system where the rack was moved by cut down Z Axis leadscrew of an Anet A8 I took apart years ago and some 8mm rods with bearings. On the jackstands, I could get the steering lock to lock in about 2 seconds. The steering angle wasn't great (about 45 degrees) but it had probably a 10 ft turning circle.

The Electronics are what I'm really proud of.  
The car runs on a CAN-bus-esque system over i2c where every major system (Front ""Axle"", rear ""axle"", steering, and lights) all are controlled by a master controller that sends them commands, checks if any of them are in an ESTOP condition, and reads telemetry data from them. So, rather than having one device have to control EVERYTHING, I let each major system handle itself and just the master control be the orchestrator.

I controlled the truck via an XBOX One controller which was paired to a ESP32-S3. The ESP32 then took all the controller inputs, packetized it (along with a checksum byte) and sent it to the truck via a 433mhz wireless serial connection).  
A controller packet looks like this:

    struct __attribute__((packed)) radio_command {
        uint8_t magic;       // 0x4B - sync/start marker - 0x4B is K... for kei truck
        uint8_t e_stop;      // 0 or 1 - This estop toggle tells the truck to hit the brakes and stop everything.
        int16_t throttle;    // 0 to 1023 - Full trigger range
        int16_t brake_trigger; // 0 to 1023
        uint8_t brake_button; // 0 or 1, functionally acts as a handbrake - engaging the speed controller brake and reducing pwm to 0 but only on the rear wheels.
        uint8_t front_brake; // 0 or 1, does what it says
        int16_t steering;    // -512 to 511
        uint8_t lights;      // 0 or 1
        uint8_t checksum;    // XOR of bytes 1-7 (not including magic)
    };

The Master controller would then verify the validity of the packet using the checksum and map the controller data to the right systems. This has the added benefit of tweaking commands after they get to the car or adding/removing layers of abstraction.

For example: In my case, since they came from different hoverboards, the front wheels were 1cm larger than the rear wheels  so they had a faster ground speed for a given throttle position. So it sends the rear wheels the actual throttle (on a range of 0-255 plus a direction bit) but for the front wheels it adjusts the throttle value on a mapped range so that the front an rear wheels are always moving the same speed.

I'm currently working on making a generic version of the firmware I wrote so that I can make it available for free for people to use. I set mine up for a car style configuration, but you could do it for a tank, boat, anything!

**The Aftermath:**

Most of the truck is still in pieces. I'm not sure what my next build will be but I don't have the heart to put the parts away until I do. Maybe I'll rebuild it. Maybe I'll build a cartoon-proportioned version. Maybe I'll take all the parts, find some more steel tubing, and build a little go kart for myself. I don't know, but I'm open to suggestions!

And, a small plug: I run a social club for makers in Santa Barbara, CA so if you live anywhere nearby and would like to join, hit me up! We just meet at coffee shops in the area once a week and talk about our projects. It's super chill.",8,1771305679.0,rccars,0,0.91,False

What's everyone's experience with natural anti-inflammatories? For me it's almost impossible to get out of bed in the morning without ibuprofen anymore, and even then I'm stiff up until my first cup of coffee. Now, I don't know if it's the coffee, or just me being awake for so long. But it's certainly starting to seem like the coffee, because it seems to correlate most to when I first start drinking it.

Then now I also I got the flipping YouTube algorithm FERVENTLY recommending me videos about this spirulina crap. Which, is like a superfood and the most nutrient dense substance on the planet or whatever. Who knew? But it also has in it something called cyanobacteria, which supposedly acts as an anti-inflammatory as well. And now it has me really curious! Is this shit really worth something, or is it just more crap?

I don't know, I'm pretty convinced already just by how passionately one of these spirulina farmers talks about it. He swears by it, it's like his flipping religion or something. What does everyone else think, though?",1,1771305657.0,ChronicPain,1,1.0,False

Recently, I have developed feelings for my best friend Kerry (18F). I'm going to give kind of an overview of the last 3-4 weeks worth of events that make me think she might like me back (mostly in chronological order).

We were really good friends for about 4 years now. The feelings on my end developed when rumors started a year ago about us being a couple (I graduated last year and she is in her sr year of high school and most of our mutual friends are in school still too).

It started as a rumor but we both said we aren't and people started making it more of a joke that we’re dating. Sometimes Kerry will play into the joke. A few weeks ago my sister passed her a note in class that said “date my brother?” and she wrote next to it “yes <3” and i dont know if it was genuine or if it was just play. and she talks to her friends about the joke.

She asked if I wanted to go to prom with her this april and I agreed. Most people that go to this schools prom arent dating because the school is tiny.

We have been hanging out more one-on-one recently. A few weeks ago we went and saw the 3rd avatar movie (was a really good movie btw) together and drove around and talked for about half an hour afterward.

I brought coffee to her and a few friends/teachers at the school and when I asked what she wanted she said “Have I told you recently that I VALUE our friendship? I would LOVE a frappe” but im not sure if that was just because she was grateful that i was bringing coffee :/ I have subtly been trying to do some nice things for her that im not doing to others. When i brought her the frappe, I got her a bigger size than anyone else (everyone other than her got mediums while she got a large) and I brought her a chocolate chip muffin with the coffee.

A few days later she messaged me “wyd” and I said that I had just gotten to work and still had 8 hours on my shift. Then she said “Nooooo” then said “But I wanted to hang out before I have to work at 4:45” so I asked if maybe we could hang out the next day instead and she said it wouldn't work but the next next day (Sunday) would work for both of us. It was also her moms birthday so she asked if I wanted to come to the party.

On Valentine’s Day, I texted her “happy Valentine’s Day to an amazing friend.” and she sent back “Happy Valentines day to my most valuable friend” which was the second time she said I was a valuable friend to her within the last two weeks.

I did go to her house and celebrated her mothers birthday with her family. I was the only one there that wasn't an immediate family member or one of her siblings' girlfriends.

Weve been completely platonic friends for so long that I am so nervous that I am making things up and these are normal! Ive been overthinking this a lot and dont know what to do! I don’t want to misread friendliness as interest and make things weird. But I also don’t want to stay passive and accidentally cement myself as the safe guy she never considers romantically.

I know that I’d like her to be my girlfriend. I just don’t know if she’s waiting for me to make a move, or if she’s perfectly happy keeping this where it is.

Be blunt. I need clarity more than comfort. If anything needs more clarification or you huys have any questions I'll do my best to answer!",1,1771305296.0,relationship_advice,13,0.67,False

The sky was an image that foreshadowed the weeping of an imminent storm. Below, in the realm of the abyssal, Poseidon ruled the depths; but above, on the surface, man had erected his own gods: steel monsters that defied the horizon.


Leading the vanguard, the Orion, a state-of-the-art battleship that seemed forged in the very heart of industrial hell, cut through the waves with arrogance. Behind it came not a mere escort, but an international coalition of sixty ships. It was an iron wall that stretched as far as the eye could see, a legion of flags united by fear and order.


Among the colossi, the Napoleon stood out, the pride of the French navy, under the command of Jean Pierre, the most decorated navigator of the modern era. Sixty ships, from agile frigates to massive destroyers, formed a perfect hunting formation.

On every deck, the chaos was a controlled symphony. Thousands of soldiers marched to the rhythm of a death that already breathed down their necks. The crews, taut as violin strings, prepared their batteries for what they knew was an inevitable clash.

And at the tip of that global spear, standing firm on the bridge of the Orion, stood Admiral Michael Ross. With fifty years of experience etched on his face, Ross felt the weight of the sixty ships that followed him like his own shadow. He was the shepherd of that pack of metal wolves, and although the world saw him as a god of war, he knew that today, facing the storm, his past would come to collect its due.
The Alliance's sixty-ship formation advanced with the confidence of an empire, but the radar began to return echoes that shouldn't be there. On the horizon, where the gray sky merged with the leaden water, a black stain emerged from the mist. It didn't look like a fleet; it looked like an open wound in the ocean, devouring the sea in its path.


On the Orion's bridge, the silence became so thick you could cut it with a knife. Suddenly, the open radio frequency—the one used only for international emergencies or unconditional surrenders—came alive. Cold static preceded a voice that wasn't shouting, but carried the weight of a death sentence.


""Admiral Ross..."" The voice was calculating, devoid of any trace of doubt.


Michael Ross tensed. He didn't need the intelligence report. That cadence, that icy tone that seemed to chill the air inside the bridge, was a scar on his memory. The officers around him were petrified as they watched the face of their Admiral, the man with fifty years of experience, drain of color in an instant.

It was a familiar voice. A voice that belonged to a past Ross believed he had sunk with his own hands.

The roar of the helicopter died away on the deck of the Orion, leaving only the whistling of the wind and the scent of salt air. Michael Ross, flanked by his two officers, watched the figure that had haunted his nightmares descend: Lev Kamenev. Elegant, disciplined, the captain of the ""Ghost Fleet"" walked as if the steel of the battleship were an extension of his own skin.


A small table was set up, an oasis of civilization amidst sixty warships. A sailor silently served the coffee. Kamenev: one spoonful of sugar. Ross: two. A decades-old ritual that had survived betrayal.


""How is Nadezhda?"" Ross asked, breaking the silence.


""Bigger and more beautiful,"" Kamenev replied with icy calm. ""Don't doubt it.""


Ross nodded, lost for a second in memory.


""Do you remember when you challenged me in front of the whole class? A race to the buoy.""


""How could I forget?"" Kamenev laughed, a dry sound that didn't reach his eyes. ""I earned my promotion that day.""
They laughed together, like two ghosts sharing an anecdote from a life that no longer belonged to them. Then, the mask of politeness cracked.


“What happened to you, Lev?” Ross asked, looking him in the eye.

Kamenev took a sip of his coffee and set it down on the table with terrifying slowness.

“I simply opened my eyes, Michael. I saw beyond what others could see.”


“On the St. Mary, everything was wonderful… but once we left, the blindfold fell off,” Kamenev said. “You chose the old world, Michael. I chose the future, and my children chose to follow me.”

Ross was silent. He remembered the day the fleet split in two a decade ago. He remembered seeing his godchildren's names on the deserter list and feeling his chest fill with lead.

""Surrender,"" Kamenev declared, launching his poisoned dart. ""Hand over your officers and prevent a massacre.""

Ross raised his eyebrows as he took a final sip from his cup.

""You know that's not possible, Lev.""

""Making bad decisions again, Ross,"" Kamenev retorted, rising with lethal grace.

Coffee time was over. Kamenev turned around, but before he could take the first step toward the helicopter, Ross's voice stopped that Swiss-watch-like mechanism with the force of an impact.

""I'm sorry,"" Ross said.
Kamenev stopped dead in his tracks. The seconds stretched like years, heavy and crackling with static electricity. His most loyal officers, impassive shadows behind him, didn't even blink. Lev processed Ross's ""I'm sorry,"" and then, with sinister slowness, he turned on his heels. He walked back to the table, maintaining that steely posture that characterized him, but his eyes... his eyes were no longer those of an admiral, they were those of a man staring from the bottom of a grave.


""Eight years too late, Michael,"" Kamenev said, his voice sounding like it came from the depths of the ocean. ""Eight long years too late.""


Ross kept his gaze, his voice firm but cracking with a brutal honesty that burned in his throat.


""I didn't know they were there, Lev."" Had I known... I would never have ordered the attack.

Then the calm shattered. The captain of the Ghost Fleet exploded, breaking through his mask of discipline and raising his voice like thunder that drowned out the roar of the sea.

""They were your godchildren!"" Kamenev roared, taking a violent step toward Ross. ""You knew they had sworn allegiance to the cause, Michael. You knew they were in that sector. You simply chose to shoot first and ask questions later to prove to your superiors that your uniform is spotless. You were at their freshman year party! You carried them in your arms, Michael! You sent them Christmas presents, cards signed with your name... and then you sank them to the bottom of the sea.""

""Or what about that time?"" Kamenev spat, his contempt burning. That civilian vessel sending out distress signals on the horizon... You knew we could have helped them, Michael. We were within striking distance. But you didn't. You let them die because it wasn't on your agenda.

Ross clenched his jaw, but the Rebel Admiral continued, delivering the final blow.

""From that day on, I understood, 'old friend.' The uniform doesn't make the Captain. His decisions, his honor, and above all, his word do. You lost all three at the bottom of the ocean.""

Kamenev turned, his cape flapping in the fury of the wind. Before boarding the helicopter, he delivered his war sentence over his shoulder:

""I'll see you on the battlefield, Michael. Make sure your keel is strong, because I'm going to break it with the weight of every soul you abandoned.""

The helicopter's engine roared, rising and rapidly gaining altitude as it disappeared into the black smudge on the horizon. On the deck of the Orion, Michael Ross stood motionless, watching the aircraft's silhouette dwindle to a tiny dot beneath the dark slab of sky. He had let Lev go, not out of weakness, but because deep in his weary soul, Ross felt he owed him this last chance at justice.



Aboard the aircraft, the Admiral of the Ghost Fleet didn't look back. Only when the Orion was a miniature steel shell in the distance did Kamenev nod to one of his officers.


""Open fire.""


The order traveled through the radio waves like a lethal virus. In an instant, the gray horizon blazed into a furious orange. The Rebellion's ships, hidden until then in absolute silence, cast off their steel moorings.

A salvo of long-range missiles and surface torpedoes ripped through the air at point-blank range. The roar was deafening; Michael Ross's fleet, still in waiting formation, was caught at its most vulnerable moment. Chain explosions began to light up the sea, turning the hulls of the international ships into metal funeral pyres.

Above, Kamenev's helicopter danced a suicidal waltz. The pilot maneuvered with terrifying skill, dodging the very projectiles his own ships had fired, passing so close to the missiles that the heat from the engines made the cockpit vibrate.

From the bridge, Ross saw the first impact strike the bow of a nearby French destroyer. The world of order and hierarchy he had built over fifty years was crumbling under the fire of his own protégés. The war hadn't started; the execution had begun.
The initial surprise of the Ghost Fleet sowed terror, but it failed to break the spirit of the veterans. Amid the smoke and the roar of explosions, a commanding voice boomed from the coalition radio with the force of a 400mm cannon.

""Here, Jean Pierre! Don't back down!"" roared the French navigator from the bridge of his flagship. ""Long live France!""

As if that cry were the switch that ignited the soul of the sixty ships, the Napoleon was the first to breathe fire. Their anti-aircraft batteries created a leaden wall that intercepted the next salvo of rebel missiles in mid-flight, filling the sky with fiery blossoms.

In unison, following the example of French pride, the international coalition awoke from its slumber. The sea, which minutes before had been a gray mirror, became a hell of white trails and crisscrossing trajectories. Hundreds of missiles were launched from the silos of the Alliance destroyers, responding to Kamenev's attack with a curtain of steel that sought to punish the audacity of the Ghost Fleet.

The duel of titans had begun. They were no longer men talking about coffee; they were two worldviews colliding in a symphony of destruction. Michael Ross, from the Orion, watched as the horizon disappeared behind the wall of smoke from the greatest naval battle the century had witnessed.

hi reddit. throwaway account just to make sure my main accounts algorithm isn't messed up. 

To start off, I (31 M) really prefer going to movie theaters by myself. Its always been my thing since I've started earning money to go catch a movie maybe once or twice a month. Now I also have tinnitus so I always have this ringing noise in my ears basically 24/7, so when I watch movies I try my best to focus on the movie, drown out the ringing sound and not get distracted from the plot. I don't like it when I have to talk or chat to people while watching and if there's a movie I really want to watch, I often go about two to three weeks after it's release just to thin out the crowds. I might make exceptions for special occasions (example: my teenage sister is a Marvel fan, so I treated her to see the Avengers when it came out) but on the regular I really just prefer going by myself. Its my way of de-stressing. 

Now I've recently been seeing this girl, (Lets call her Zoe, she's 29) for about half a year now.  Things have been really good with her and we haven't had any major fights or quarrels. She's very sweet and I really like her but the one thing I will say is that she's very chatty while I'm more of a quiet guy myself. 

Early on in our relationship I did bring up my weird preference of only watching movies by myself and she said she was cool with it and didn't mind. Now I do feel bad for this sometimes so to make up for it I usually try to do as many of things that she likes to do instead, like going out to brunches, hiking, sewing and I also try to watch the shows she likes whenever we're chilling at her place. 

On to the problem. A few days ago I finally went to see the new Avatar movie since it had already been almost a month since it came out and the crowds have finally thinned out. Since it was about three hours long I thought I might as well go out to dinner with Zoe afterwards and texted her. Plans were made and everything was good. 

I go in to the cinema and go to my assigned seat and saw that my row of seats was almost empty save for two women about two spaces away from mine. As I was sitting down, the woman closest to my seat suddenly said name. I didn't properly see her in the dark but it turns out that it was an old co-worker of mine from a previous office I had worked at and the other lady next to her was her friend. I said hello and made some polite small talk but when the film started I kept quiet and focused on the film like usual. They were a bit chatty during the film but not so loud to be distracting so I didn't really mind. I'm not gonna give any opinions about the movie here as I'm not a die hard Avatar fan but all in all I thought it was pretty good. 

When the movie ended and as I was exiting the cinema, my old co-worker caught up to me to chat for a bit as her friend was going to the restroom. As we stepped out from the cinema, I thought about texting Zoe to see where she was when I actually saw her by the entrance of the cinema. I remembered that I did actually text her the time table of the movie I was seeing and she had apparently been waiting there to surprise me. She asked who it was I as talking too and I introduced her to my old co-worker. After saying goodbye to my coworker, we left to go get dinner but I can tell that Zoe's mood had suddenly shifted and soured. 

Her bad mood persisted all throughout dinner and the evening but I waited until we were in my car to ask her what was wrong. She said that she was upset that I had ""gone and watched a movie with some other woman"" while I had never once even bothered to invite her to watch. What made it worse was apparently she was a big fan of the Avatar movies (a fact that I did not know and she had only brought up at that moment) 

I tried to explain that it was just pure coincidence that I met with her and that we weren't even seated directly next to each other and that I only chatted with her to be polite but she was still upset and even started to shout and cry a bit. She said that watching movies was ""my special thing"" and that she was hurt that I allowed some stranger to take part of that special thing when she couldn't. I again tried to explain my side but she just asked me to just drop her off at her place and stayed quiet for the rest of the car ride. 

Its been about four days and I haven't heard from her yet and she won't respond to any of my text. I honestly don't know what to do about this situation as I honestly think I haven't really done anything wrong. I haven't really dated that much and this is the first serious relationship despite my age. It got me thinking if my preference of watching movies by myself is such an asshole of a thing to do since most partners often go to the movies together, right? So Reddit am I the asshole and any suggestions on this as well?

**OOP** 

>>I knew her mood shifted but at the time I didn't really know why or what was the cause. If it was just a minor issue then I thought a bit of lighthearted small talk and food might lift up her mood first before I brought it up. If it was something major then I wouldn't really want to make a scene in public anyway. Also the restaurant we ate at was a place we both really like. If we made a scene there it would forever be associated with that and would be harder to return to in the future.

>>
>> I haven't really taken her to the movies before. I guess I got used to the fact that there was an agreement between us that I could watch by myself so I didn't really ask her after I explained my whole thing to her. That's my bad I guess 
>>
>> We usually do watch Netflix and stuff at her place but when we do we almost always end up chatting throughout the whole thing so I'm not really sure if what we're watching is her preference or not. 
>>
>> As for her insecurity issues, I know she has some ex's but she doesn't really want to talk about it and I don't really push. I'm not sure if she got cheated on or what led to their break ups but I'll maybe ask if and when she responds to me. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/znfMdZgtge)  **Feb 10, 2026 (Next Day)** 

Hello Reddit. Not really sure if I'm doing updates right but I decided to post an update about my situation and what happened. 

To give a short recap about my previous post, I (31 M) have a personal preference of going to the movies by myself. My gf(29) saw me walking out of a movie theatre with an female colleague from a previous job, who I met there by coincidence, and got upset at me and hasn't talked to me for about four days now. 

It's been about a day since my post and my girlfriend finally responded to text. She apologized profusely about not responding to me right away and explained that she had to deal with some problems with her family that came up  and she only had the mental and emotional strength to deal with one issue at a time. I am aware that she does have some family drama right now(wont go into it here just for privacy and unrelated anyway) and I said I understood and that I wasn't really upset about that. We decided to meet up in person and talk things out. 

I picked her up and we go to a coffee place near her home. After we sat down with our orders she immediately started to apologize for all the things she said that night and that after she had woke up the next day she had realized how ridiculous she had sounded. 

Now a few of the comments on my post mentioned her insecurities and stuff like that so I wanted to touch up on that. I said that I accepted her apology but I also needed to know where her line of reasoning came from and what caused her to have an outburst like that. 

She then confessed that about a year before she met me she had caught her now ex boyfriend cheating on her. She said that she went to surprise him with lunch one time and had caught him walking out their workplace with his arm around one of his female co-workers. So when she, once again, was waiting to surprise me at the movie theater and saw me walking out with another woman, she had severe flashbacks to that moment when she caught her ex and her anxiety flared up. 

It also didn't help that her best friend, who she usually asks advice from, apparently really doesn't like me. A few months after we had met, her friend apparently warned her that I was ""too quiet for a guy"" and that I gave a shady vibe. I apparently looked like the type of person who kept secrets and that she should be suspicious of me. Although she initially just brushed her off, this basically implanted a seed of doubt in her. 

I guess she felt really guilty about the whole thing because she was in a real confessing kind of mood. I kind of just sat there in silence for a bit just because I really needed to process everything she was saying. 

After a bit of thinking I finally brought up the topic of how we were gonna move forward. 

She said that she realized that what she did was really unreasonable but she didn't want to break up. I also said that, while I was hurt with what happened, I also didn't want to break up over what was essentially a really big misunderstanding. But I also told her, as politely as I can, that she really needs to maybe work on any other unresolved issues she might still feel about her ex, maybe even therapy if needed. 

She said that while she would definitely do better and work on her insecurities, she didn't think it warranted therapy yet. I told her to think about it some more if possible and that I would support her in any way I can. After chatting a bit more (mostly about her nosy friend and how she should really mind her own business lol) we went home feeling much better. 

Anyway Reddit that's about it. I know some commenters mentioned about how I should break up with her but I really think this is about as good an outcome as it gets. I also went ahead and invited her to watch a movie on Valentine's day. Although I'll still mostly continue to watch movies by myself, I'll maybe try to work on including Zoe from now on. Thanks for the people that gave advice. You guys gave me a lot to think about while I was waiting on her reply and I really appreciated it. Have good one!

**OOP** 

>>> There was a bit chaos in the end lmfao. I didn't know if I should include it since it wasn't related but after we had our discussion and I dropped her home, her 6 year old nephew sicced their dog at me. He thought that we had broken up and since the only thing he knew about break ups were what he saw in tv dramas, he essentially labelled me as a ""bad ex""

>>> Don't worry though, their dog is a less than a year old Chihuahua 😂 the thing was barely the size of my foot

One idea I thought of that I love is aging up Daisy Mae a bit to be a preteen or teen. It would really be emotionally resonant I feel to see her aged up for people who played NH for years. 

Another idea is integrate CJ and Flick into Nooks Cranny on tournament days. The cranny and its offerings become themed around bugs and fish on their respective days. Also I’d love if stuff like New Year’s or Toy Day have all the occasional npcs in town that day or at least had a chance to bring multiple npcs on days they usually wouldn’t be.

I’m kinda stuck on what kind of town it should be. We had wild world for frontier vibes, city folk for city, new leaf for a more modern small town, and new horizons for islands obviously. (Although I may be wrong about ww and cf since I’ve only played nl and nh) I’d love to hear ideas for a theme for a future game

Also please a shorter tutorial, no tool durability, and less grinding. I do like the crafting system but it felt way too grindy and centralizing.

I would love if we could make our own shop and put some handmade items up for sale and we could decorate the shop as we see fit. Or we could work part time for some of the shops and they each have a different feel. Like Mable sisters would be akin to style savvy, Brewsters akin to Coffee Talk, and so on.

I’m being asked to pay rent to live with my only family atm and it’s not like I moved out and came back, I’ve always been here & w them, just turned 18 recently. My grandmother (legal mother) also told me she’s going to leave all my car insurance, health insurance, phone bills, and ofc the rent to me, as she’s now just moving out to go live somewhere else leaving me with my drunken,hoarding aunt&uncle who will now run the house. She even often complains about how bad they are at managing their relationship and space, how they don’t leave the house or how they drink so much, saying she’s worried what the house is gonna look like. I have a job, a decent job that pays 20$ an hour but I work part time, it’s not like I \*cant\* pay the rent but I am saving 35% of my paycheck every two weeks, and more when I have left over SO THAT I can go to college. Because not anyone is going to give me any financial support for that either, besides whatever support I can find. Not only ontop of all of that I’ve been already paying for everything I eat&cook&drink , wear , my gas for the car, the permit and license for the car , anything for work (I’m a chef so it’s pretty expensive), every hygienic product besides toilet paper, my own snacks for 3 years since my first paycheck; I’m so serious the only things that I cost of them is the toilet paper and some salt&pepper, barely any electricity even because I don’t even stay there that often as I prefer to stay with my boyfriend (also w his parents). I always turn off my lights, my heater or conditioner, I always shut my door, AND THEY STEAL THE THINGS I BUY without asking despite ALL of that. Whole bags of coffee beans, half n half’s w my name on it, chips, chocolates in my room, my blankets for their bed, weed , papers, my guitar, leftovers you name it. 

For a little background, I’ve been staying with my grandmother since I was around 4-5, she adopted me and my younger brother (he’s no longer with us). We lived with 5 other people in a run down house that wasn’t taken care of. My parents weren’t in my life and she was my mother providing for housing, food , school, etc. She always had help financially from my father’s side of the family with all the clothes , furniture, christmases and birthdays, until we moved to another state and gradually that completely stopped. The house we have has decent rent but bills can get expensive for her , so my aunt and uncle moving out was a plus as she could charge them rent, being in their 30’s too.

I turned 18 and she already had plans since I’m legally an adult atp. Now she’s moving out to this nice renovated duplex , and leaving me with my currently unstable drinking aunt & uncle, giving me the very last of anything she’s been paying for me to do. I can’t tell if this is unfair or if it’s a normal experience bc everyone’s lives are so different.

\*\*\*\*⭐️what car insurance can I look into? I’m a safe driver. Health insurance, what’s some options you’ve kept with? Side hustles or ways to make “easy” money? I’m very creative and artsy, ofc good at cooking being a chef atm and doing it at home⭐️\*\*\*\*",1,1771304171.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

[V60],"I've been brewing with the V60 for about 3 months. I mainly use Hoffman's Ultimate Technique, Tetsu's 4:6 method, and sometimes the 3-pour methods I come across on Instagram. 

Sometimes the cup is amazing, sometimes a bit dull, sometimes a little flat, and sometimes the best. The 4:6 method usually results in a great cup, and with some roasts and processes, the 3-pour method works quite nicely. And sometimes none of the recipes work at all! Especially this month's batch. Nothing's wrong with the batch. I'm probably doing a pretty poor job brewing them. 

So, I am looking for recipes that people usually use for an everyday cup with variations for the type of coffee and process. Please recommend some. Appreciate it!!

  
Note: I typically brew light, light plus and medium roasts. I leave the dark roasts and nutty medium dark roasts for Aeropress (which is also my go-to escape point when I'm consistently brewing bad cups with the V60). ",4,1771304141.0,pourover,26,0.75,False

My mom took a day off work, rented a car, and went to go get her. My mom was stressed and I told her she didn't have to go, but she did anyways. My sister came home with the flu and got us all sick. She slept on the living room (she could have slept in her bedroom but refused for some reason), left tissues on the coffee table, was coughing everywhere, and barely showered while she was here.

Once she left, I told my family I was upset that she got us all sick just because she wanted to go to the parade. They could have told her no. They called me negative and told me I should be happy I got to see my sister (I am visiting from California). I told them i wasn't upset she came down to see us, I was upset she didn't wait it out until she had recovered (she had a three day weekend but came home early just for the parade).

Maybe some of this is lingering feelings I have over the past. She did the same thing when she had COVID. We have a family friends graduation that she showed up with with COVID. I was livid.

My parents say she didn't intend to get us sick and it wasn't that bad until she went to the parade.

1r6wsuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/2under2/comments/1r6wsuv/my_experience_5_months_in/,My experience 5 months in…,"Thought I’d do a little post to anybody about to have 2under 2 pr in NB trenches…

So mine are 16m apart, now have a 21m old girl and 5m old boy and I can finally breathe a sigh of relief, I am not by any means out of the woods yet but omg I’m in a much better place…

I found the first 3 months the hardest!!! Just so so intense, I think I had a touch of PPD and was offered meds by my dr. I cried daily and just found everything so so hard. I really struggled with my new reality and my constant thoughts were ‘WTF have we done’, I should probably add no 2 was not planned and I had a difficult pregnancy and found it hard to be excited about no 2 quite truthfully. Me and my husband were fighting daily, my house looked like a bomb had gone off and I just found a newborn and a newly walking 16m old so so hard to manage.

HOWEVER 4 months in I started to see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, my youngest didnt need feeding as much and was quite happy chilling in his bouncer or playmat and my toddler steadier on her feet now, little episodes of them intereacting and giggling at eachother. My son just loves watching my daughter play. I’m finding going out with them both easier..

5 month mark and I am actually somewhat enjoying it, the daily crying/breakdowns have stopped, I think I probably have mini breakdowns once every couples of weeks instead of daily now 😂, my son is sleeping longer stretches now and I’m not as sleep deprived. It is still hard and I am still in survival mode tbh but I’m coping alot better and can see an easier future, looking forward to graduating 2under 2 in May tbh!! My house still can be a shambles but I am staying on top of it much better now..

My advice:

If you can get help from a family or a friend,  take it!!! I stayed with my mum half the week in the beginning and it saved me as I was just not coping. If you can put your eldest into nursery or some sort of childcare setting, do it!!! Unfortunately we could not afford to put my eldest in, but if we could have we absolutely would have. Even if just 2 days a week. Anything!!

Try and get your toddler onto a good sleep schedule, I hve been super lucky with my first and shes slept through the night and napped well from about 6 months, that has probably saved me! I was very strict with her naps and sleep from about 4/5months and it has def paid off, I tracked windows and had a solid routine with her. So if you are pregnant and have time work on ensuring your toddler has a good nap routine!! My daughter naps for 2-3 hours in the afternoon and I dont know what I would do without that time!!

Try and get outside daily, you will go stir crazy inside!

Find a double buggy that you love and find easy to use!

Be prepared to lower your standards, our screen time has significantly increased in our house, my house is often a mess, dinner if often just whatever I can throw together, I don’t do bath time every night if the kids haven’t left the house all day and aren’t messy/dirty because sometimes by bedtime I am just done. And it’s ok, sometimes I have to remind myself that it’s ok, things do not need to be perfect, you are in survival mode and doing your best. Nobody has died and nothing is an emergency!

Communicate with your partner - try and let go of resentment - I still struggle with this but we are no longer fighting like we were at the beginning and are back to normal.

Try and find pockets of self care for you. - I always make sure I get a hot coffee in the morning - toddler in highchair and baby in bouncer and I prioritise my morning coffee, everything else can wait. I have a shower and do my skincare every night just to feel abit nicer and that 5-10 mins feels like heaven sometimes. 

Spend time with others - I find if I stay at home alone all day for too long I get in my head and start to feel so down, I find after 48 hours at home with the kids is my limit, by day 3 I need to get out, if you have mum friends or family you can visit then try and get out as much as you can to be around other people, or even just a soft play/toddler group/ kids class, anything!!

Thats probably all I can think of right now, maybe I’ll do another update when my first turns 2 in May, but hope this helps anybody struggling atm!!",4,1771303887.0,2under2,1,0.75,False

If I want to hang out with someone, I have to ask, and sometimes she randomly says no and i need to literally beg her to let me go. It’s unpredictable, which makes me anxious just to ask in the first place.

Most of the time I can’t go anywhere unless she drives me. If she doesn’t want to, then I simply don’t go. She won’t let me go alone. In the past, the few times I “snuck out,”  (imagine sneaking out just to get coffee with friends) so instead of going home directly after uni I'd go anywhere else lol.

If I do manage to go out, she constantly calls me asking when I’m coming back, saying it’s already “too much time” even if it’s only been a short while. She demands photos or proof of where I am, and sometimes she even messages the parents of my friends to confirm that I’m actually with them. It makes me feel pathetic and embarrassed, like I’m a child who can’t be trusted instead of an adult who’s almost 20.

She also doesn’t allow me to “like” anyone. She's always telling me that if im interested in someone, I’m sick for feeling that way. Growing up, she never let me have friends over, go to classmates’ houses to do group projects, or even properly socialize. Now that I’m in university, she can’t restrict me as much because most work is done on campus but she still tries. She doesn't even allows me making phone calls with friends.

Academically, I do really well. I have excellent grades. I don’t party, I mostly stay home playing on my laptop, and I don’t cause trouble. I don’t understand what she’s trying to prevent. I feel isolated and controlled. I basically live my social life through my phone because I can’t go out freely, and it’s embarrassing telling people I can’t hang out because my mom won’t allow it.

I have one year left until I graduate and idk if i can even move out, but right now I feel trapped.

She’s unemployed right now due to recovering from long covid so I’m not sure how she can be so busy. I work 40-50 hours a week and I’d always carve out time to see someone if I wanted to see them. 

Idk maybe I’m just low priority for her? Thoughts? ",1,1771303854.0,AskMenRelationships,2,1.0,False
