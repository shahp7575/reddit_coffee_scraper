1qvktrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/everesttrekings/comments/1qvktrc/how_much_does_it_cost_for_everest_base_camp/,How much does it cost for Everest Base Camp?,"I see this question **all the time** on Reddit:

>

Short answer: **it depends a LOT** on how you trek.  
Long answer: here’s a real, no-nonsense breakdown based on current prices and real trekking experiences.

If you’re planning the **Everest Base Camp trek in 2025**, this should help you budget properly without surprises.

# Average Cost of Everest Base Camp Trek (2025)

Most trekkers fall into one of three categories:

# 1. Budget / Independent Trek – USD $1,100–$1,400

# 2. Guided Group Trek – USD $1,400–$2,200

# 3. Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek – USD $3,000–$5,500+

Let’s break down where that money actually goes.

# 1. Permits & Entry Fees (Mandatory)

No matter how you trek, these costs are fixed:

* **Sagarmatha National Park Permit** – \~$30
* **Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality Permit** – \~$20

**Total permits:** \~$50 per person

No TIMS card is required anymore for the Everest region.

# 2. Flights: Kathmandu to Lukla (Big Cost Factor)

This is usually the **most stressful and expensive part**.

# Lukla Flight Cost

* **$220 one way**
* **$440 round trip**

During peak seasons (March–May & Sept–Nov), flights often operate from **Ramechhap instead of Kathmandu**, which adds:

* 4–5 hour drive each way
* Extra hotel night
* Transport cost \~$20–$40

👉 **Budget tip:** Many trekkers forget to include Ramechhap logistics.

# 3. Accommodation on the Trail

Everest Base Camp is a **teahouse trek**.

# Typical Cost:

* **$5–$10 per night** (basic room)
* Rooms get more expensive as altitude increases
* Heated rooms = extra cost

Most lodges make money on food, not rooms.

# 4. Food & Drinks (This Adds Up Fast)

This is where many budgets fail.

# Average Daily Food Cost:

* **$25–$35 per day**
* Meals cost more the higher you go

Examples:

* Dal bhat: $6–$9
* Fried rice/noodles: $6–$8
* Tea/coffee: $2–$5
* Bottled water (avoid if possible): $3–$5

💡 **Pro tip:** Bring a water purifier — bottled water is expensive and bad for the environment.

# 5. Guide & Porter Costs (Optional but Worth It)

# Guide Cost

* **$25–$35 per day**
* Usually includes insurance, salary, food, accommodation

# Porter Cost

* **$20–$30 per day**
* Carries \~15–20 kg

# Guide + Porter Package

* \~$30–$40 per day total

For a **12–14 day trek**, expect:

* **$350–$600** for porter/guide services

Many trekkers say this is **the best money spent**, especially for safety and altitude awareness.

# 6. Everest Base Camp Trek Package Cost (All-Inclusive)

If you don’t want to organize everything yourself:

# Standard Guided EBC Trek

* **$1,400–$2,200** Includes:
* Permits
* Domestic flights
* Guide & porter
* Accommodation & meals on trek

# Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek

* **$3,000–$5,500+** Includes:
* Best lodges available
* Private guide
* Kathmandu 4–5 star hotels
* Better meals
* Optional helicopter return

# 7. Extra Costs People Forget

These sneak up on you:

* Hot showers: $3–$8
* Charging devices: $3–$6 per hour
* Wi-Fi cards: $5–$10
* Tips for guide/porter: \~$100–$150 total
* Travel insurance (must cover high altitude): $100–$200

# Total Everest Base Camp Trek Cost Summary

# Budget Trek (Independent)

**$1,100–$1,400**

# Guided Group Trek

**$1,500–$2,200**

# Luxury Trek / Helicopter Return

**$3,000–$5,500+**

# Is Everest Base Camp Worth the Cost?

Honestly?  
For most people — **yes**.

You’re walking through:

* Sherpa villages
* Buddhist monasteries
* Glaciers and suspension bridges
* Views of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Ama Dablam

And you don’t need technical climbing skills — just **fitness, patience, and good acclimatization**.

# Final Advice from Someone Who’s Seen It First-Hand

* Don’t choose the **cheapest option blindly**
* Budget extra days for weather delays
* Spend money on **safety, not luxury**
* Everest Base Camp is not just a trek — it’s a **life experience**

If you’re planning for **Everest Base Camp in 2026**, start budgeting early and be realistic. It’s not cheap — but it’s also not as expensive as people think when done right.

1qvkqxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qvkqxy/theres_a_course_teaching_the_universes_secrets/,There’s a course teaching the universe’s secrets. Lesson 1: How to survive when facing a primordial god,"High school was the worst years of my life. It was a nightmare being a teenager with raging hormones, always in confusion about your own self, and constantly stuck in a make-believe social battleground for attention and recognition. Unfortunately, no matter how much I hate that awful time and place, how much I want to leave all the painful memories behind to move on with my life, I simply can’t. I can’t because there is still someone, a ghost of my past, an apparition of my regret, chaining me to a small high school in the countryside.

Ivy and I were best friends from childhood. I had always been the oddball, struggling to find my place in any class since kindergarten. Ivy, meanwhile, was a social butterfly who could immediately captivate anyone she met. Yet, despite our contradictory natures, we were thick as thieves. 

Upon entering teenage years, however, something changed in our relationship. My feelings toward Ivy were no longer those of a mere friend. I realized I love her. Even so, I never mustered the courage to confess, partly because I was a coward, but mostly because I thought two girls like us wouldn’t have any future in our heavily conservative community. I decided to withhold my love for Ivy so as not to damage our friendship. That choice was my gravest agony, haunting me for the rest of my days.
 
Ivy took her own life not long after we entered our senior year. Apparently, her parents found out she had been pregnant and cut ties with her, pushing Ivy to a desperate decision. Her funeral was perfunctory. As I said, we lived in a heavily conservative community where people’s faith blinded their humanity, and Ivy just committed two of the greatest sins: getting pregnant before marriage and taking her own life. Nobody grieved for Ivy - nobody except for me. 

I left my hometown soon after, but I returned every year to tend Ivy’s grave for the last eight years. This year, I was cleaning her faded gravestone when I noticed a strange black envelope stuck to its back. It was an odd sight, as no one else ever visited Ivy besides me, not even her own family. Even stranger, the envelope was addressed to me by name. Inside was a small piece of paper, written in a style identical to my friend’s: “Meet me in the classroom. Signed, Ivy.”

I furiously stormed to my former high school. I didn’t know who left that note and what they wanted from me. Maybe it was a cruel prank by an old classmate. Perhaps it was some criminals luring me in to rob me dry. I couldn’t care less. They dared to mock my friend’s tragedy, to mock our friendship, and all I wanted was to make them pay.

It was winter break, so the building was void of any students. I bribed the security staff to let me in with a few bucks and an excuse about wanting to reminisce. After making my way through barren hallways, I was shocked to find a group of people in my old classroom. Eleven adults were sitting on school desks with attached chairs that were too small for them. Their expressions showed stress and anxiety, yet also focus. There was an empty desk in a corner, so I suspect they were still waiting for one more person.   

The situation’s bizareness caught me off guard, diverting me from my anger. Was this a class reunion, a filming set, or some nostalgia therapy group? I almost turned around and left them alone before noticing a certain someone. Sitting next to the empty desk was a beautiful young girl with round blue eyes and smooth, long black hair. She wore a simple, white dress and cream jacket that complemented her blushing skin. Her face, even when nervous, still radiated an aura of joy and kindness, the energy I knew too well.

As if hypnotized, I rushed toward the girl and aggressively grabbed her hand while shouting Ivy’s name outloud. For a moment, I honestly thought it was my friend returning to me in a hyper-realistic dream of sorts. I immediately realized my mistake as the girl looked up to me, full of awkwardness and confusion. At a closer look, her blue eyes were a shade darker than my friend’s.

“Uh, hi, uhm, my name is Rachel. You must have mistaken me for someone else, haha…”

“I, uhm, I thought you were someone I knew… I’ll, uhm, leave you and your friends to, uhm, whatever you guys are doing. Sorry for the trouble!” I clumsily apologized, cursing my social ineptitude.

“Hey, no worry! I was just a little startled!” Rachel gave me a sympathetic smile. “I’m not blaming you. Everyone here has their own story, after all!”

“Right. So anyway, I’m leav…”

Before I could finish my sentence, a sudden chill ran down my spine, freezing me in place. Something just entered the classroom. My eyes told me it was a middle-aged bald man in casual business attire, wearing thick glasses. Every other part of my body, down to the most minuscule cell, instinctively told me that thing was not human. I felt as if I was a mouse facing an eagle, a rabbit facing a tiger, a prey facing its predator. 

“Class will soon begin. All students must return to their seats! Standing up during class is a rule violation and will result in severe disciplinary actions.” 

The entity spoke in an otherworldly dominant voice, echoing inside and bending my mind to its will. As much as I wanted to get out of there, I had no other choice but to sit down on the remaining desk. 

“Very good. Now then, since everyone’s here, let’s start the lesson with a quick introduction. My name is Thoth, and I’ll be your homeroom teacher for this class, the ‘Secrets of the Universe 101.’ By the end of this course, students will learn a secret knowledge of the universe that no other living human should have known. The curriculum consists of three lessons, extending over three days, including today. The first two classes will have practical homework. On the final day, we’ll have a short exam to determine if you are qualified to pass the course. You can only acquire the secret you design after completing all three lessons and the final exam. Any questions so far?”

I had many questions, but my mouth was too trembled to speak up. However, as scared as I was, my mind had already started processing the situation. Thoth was clearly not human, so he must either be a pagan god or a demon. If my knowledge of the occult through media were applicable, I would have a very high chance of dying and getting my soul trapped for eternity. Still, if I made it through the whole ordeal, I could finally learn why Ivy had to die, who was responsible, and how to exact my vengeance on them. Were these answers worth risking my life for? Did I have any other choice? I wondered to myself as Thoth continued his speech.

“Now then, I will go over the class rules. I highly suggest memorizing them by heart because failing to comply will result in severe disciplinary action, or, in your kind’s words, death. There are five rules as follows:
- No talking, eating, sleeping, or standing up and moving around during classes!
- You will work in pairs to finish your assignments before the next class. If one of you fails, the other will suffer the same fate.
- You can drop out at any time, consequence-free, after finishing your homework. Just don’t show up to the next class, and I’ll just assume you quit. However, if you continue to show up but your partner doesn’t, well, it’s such to be you.
- You can ask for outside help with your assignments.
- The secret you learn at the course’s end will be decided by your heart. Only those with a worthy strength of heart may receive their answers.

As for the pairing, the closest person to your side will be your partner, simple as that.”

So, Rachel was going to be my partner, just what I needed! I turned and awkwardly waved at her, hoping to give a friendly signal, despite still being ashamed of what I had done before. Rachel smiled and waved back at me, easing my embarrassment. 

I was going to introduce myself to Rachel when suddenly, the two people sitting in front of us’s heads exploded. I had to force my mouth closed using two hands to prevent any scream from slipping out. Apparently, one of them was doing the exact same thing I had intended to do, which violated the first rule of no talking in class. It could have been me had I spoken up just a second sooner. Even with blood splashed all over my face and clothes, I sat motionless in fear, afraid of moving even one muscle. Around me, a heavy atmosphere fell over the classroom as others also realized the fragility of their lives. Still, the teacher couldn’t care less about the incident and proceeded with his lesson.  

**Lesson 1: How to survive when facing a primordial god.**

“Primordial deities are divine cosmic entities possessing nigh omniscient and omnipotent capability, representing the most fundamental forces creating the universe. Despite their immense power, progenitor gods of opposing natures have constantly struggled against each other in perpetual conflicts since the dawn of time, creating a delicate balance that limits their influence on the material plane, allowing your universe to survive and thrive…”

“... by distributing pieces of their aspects among servants to do their bidding, primordial gods can affect the mortal world in hope of tipping the scales against their primal rivals…”

“... a progenitor deity’s domain is where their servants have the strongest connection to the master and thus are the most powerful…”  

Thot kept going on and on with his lecture, most of which I couldn’t understand and refused to digest. Instead, my mind sank into the sea of its own horrifying thoughts. After an eternity, our teacher finally finished monologuing. I expected him to explain the homework, but Thot just dismissed the class, and with a snap of his finger, the whole classroom vanished into thin air.

I found myself alone in an empty classroom. Every desk except for mine was neatly stored at the back, showing no sign of recent usage. I looked around for Rachel, but she had also disappeared without a trace. My brain struggled to process what had just happened, wondering if it was all a nightmare. 

A security guard came and hurried me out, saying he had seen me dozing off all afternoon but was too embarrassed to wake me. So, the ‘Secrets of the Universe 101’ class was just a nightmare reflecting my disdain for high school. But then something felt wrong. That’s right, blood from before still covered my entire body. That meant I actually attended that strange class. 

“Hey, er, I was thinking if you notice anything different about my appearance?” I probed.

“What do you mean? Oh, are you flirting with me? Hehe, alright, I’m free tonight, so why don’t we go out for a cup of coffee?”

“No, I mean, how can you not see that I’m covered in blood!?” 

The guard’s face fell, figuratively at first. A nanosecond later, his face literally fell onto the floor like a skin mask, revealing a blob of muscle and blood where it was supposed to be. The guard’s entire body started mutating. Giant flesh tendrils pierced out of his limbs. His skin and muscle melted together into a black, viscous substance. His bones stretched upward, snapped rapidly, and then healed back as the guard became a giant, slimy abomination covered in goo and tentacles. The environment outside the classroom also changed, revealing a hellish landscape of ruined buildings, black sludge, and horrendous monsters, enveloped by a sickening green sky. 

“You think you’re so smart, puny human? I could have given you a merciful death had you just walked out. But now, it will be a long and painful one! Thot’s little game won’t protect you much longer! You are in my master’s domain now!” 

Even without a mouth, the monster released horrendous screams by vibrating its body. It slammed tentacles into an invisible barrier covering the doorframe, shaking up the entire room. The presence of this thing, despite not being as overwhelming as Thot’s, still terrified me to my core. As the walls started cracking down, I could do nothing but huddle into a ball, awaiting my inevitable doom. 

Suddenly, a roaring gunshot stopped the monster in its tracks. It was Rachel holding a dessert eagle outside. She emptied her magazine, temporarily stunning the mutated guard. A  new sense of hope bloomed in my heart, allowing my body to move again. I wasted no time jumping out of the classroom and toward Rachel. We raced for another ruin as the monstrosity chased right after us. Rachel kept reloading her gun and unloading bullets at our pursuer while also avoiding puddles of black goo on our way. I would never have imagined a delicate girl like her could handle a gun in such a skillful manner.

Despite my lungs almost giving out on me, we managed to cut off the guard by hiding inside an abandoned convenience store. It was my first chance to rest after entering that bizarre classroom and to speak to Rachel properly.

“Hey, thanks for saving my life. I owe you one!” 

“Don’t mention it. Besides, our lives depend on each other now, so let’s do our best to keep each other alive, okay!”

“Agree! But like, what was that thing?”

“The monster chasing us? Probably just some parasite leeching on the master of this domain. Lucky for us, it wasn’t a real servant, or we’d already be dead. But we'd better hurry and get out of here before an actual one shows up.”

“Cool, cool! But how do we get out of here?”

“You don’t remember what our teacher said during class?”

“I got a little distracted…”

“Distracted? You went through all the trouble preparing the ritual just to throw your life away on the first day by being distracted?”

“What ritual?” 

“What do you mean? The ritual to access the Secret of the Universe, of course! Why else are you here?”

For the hundredth or so time of the day, I was shocked and confused. I told Rachel I didn’t know of any ritual, which made her equally baffled. Still, we decided it was best to find our way out first before continuing this discussion.

“Okay, so according to the lesson, the only way to survive a primordial god is to call upon protection from their complementary opposition, i.e., another primal deity of reversed nature. To invoke their power, carve out their sigil on any surface with living blood, then pray to them.” Rachel explained, pulling out a notebook containing various sigils she had noted during class. 

“Can we be sure they’d answer?”

“Not really. But Thoth said if a primordial is directly targeting you, their adversary’ll be more likely to help out. Think of it as another way for them to mess with each other. Real mature, if you ask me.” 

“So I guess the first secret of the universe is that our creators are a bunch of tantrum-throwing babies. No wonder lives suck ass!”

“Amen, sister! Amen! Anyway, we need to pinpoint who to call before drawing the sigil. Any idea…”

Before Rachel could finish her sentence, the ground trembled. The entire building, including ourselves, flew upward. Above us was a vast sea of black sludge hanging upside down. Except, it wasn’t a sea, it was an open mouth of some snake, worm thing so humongous, I couldn’t even make sense of its head. This entity sucking us up was a real servant, unlike the parasite we had faced before, and we stood no chance. Our body hit the slime, and we started to drown hundreds of feet above the air.

Strangely enough, dying this way almost felt nostalgic. It was a feeling I had constantly experienced for a long time following Ivy’s death. ‘Sink into depression’ may just be a figure of speech, but the sense of hopelessness and suffocation was so real, as if I were sinking in actual water. Worse, even if I wanted to move on, depression still clung to me, dragging me back down, like sticky glue. Being engulfed in this black substance felt exactly the same.

“Can this be the nature of the god we’re fighting? But how can depression be a fundamental force of the universe? Regardless, I must try!” 

I struggled my way to the surface and reached for Rachel’s note. After frantically searching, I finally found something: Apoph, the god of darkness and negativity (including negative emotions), opposed by Amon, the god of light and positivity. Grabbing the nearest piece of brick, I carved Amon’s sigil onto my own palm and prayed. I didn’t know what the correct invocation was. I just prayed I got to live another day so there would still be someone alive to remember Ivy. 

Everything went black, and then a blinding light filled the sky. All of a sudden, I found myself in front of my old high school’s gate. There was no slime, no monster, only Rachel by my side, gasping for air.

Loved the coffee shop life until I realized my laptop couldn't survive a 2-hour session without hunting for an outlet.



Battery: 100% → 15% in 90 minutes. Fan running the whole time. Couldn't even hear my calls.



I assumed the battery was shot. 2-year-old MacBook Air, probably needed a replacement. Started pricing new laptops.



Then someone on Reddit told me to check Activity Monitor.



Chrome: 7 processes, 5GB RAM, constant CPU usage.



I had maybe 40 tabs open. Research for work, Slack, email, random articles I'd ""read later."" Normal stuff.



What I didn't know: those ""background"" tabs aren't sleeping. They're running timers, refreshing, eating battery even when you're not looking at them.



The fix was embarrassingly simple: tab suspension.



Keeps all my tabs in the bar but unloads them from memory. Click to restore. Takes like half a second.



Results after a month:

\- 90 minutes → 4+ hours of battery

\- Fan barely runs during normal work

\- Laptop stays cool on my lap

\- No more outlet hunting



I do the coffee shop thing 3x a week now. Haven't needed to buy a new laptop.

That's the only time I ever go out. This was different because, we had to wake up very early, and be at the hospital before 7 am to get her blood tested. 

I was surprisingly calm and not anxious at all throughout the time I was outside. I had been exercising this past couple of months, doing kettle bell workouts, and continueing with my green tea drinking habit. So, I was in the best shape I've been in a long, long time. 

I was able to eat out, surrounded by strangers without breaking a sweat. I did feel a liitle uncomfortable when I bought a coffee latte, and the food area, was full of nursing students. But, aside from that, I was doing surprisingly alright. 

But, as I arrived home. I felt at first, dizzy and weak. Drinking tea and eating a snack brought some energy back. But, I had to lie down, to rest my body. An hour later, my whole body is aching. My joints, tendons and muscles feel specially painful. I feel worse than when I finished a session of kettlebell workouts, the day after. My body must have been under immense stress, while I was out. I also takes lexapro. Maybe the meds is doing a great job in covering up my anxiety. ",1,1770199393.0,Agoraphobia,0,1.0,False

Lesson 1: How to survive when facing a primordial god,"High school was the worst years of my life. It was a nightmare being a teenager with raging hormones, always in confusion about your own self, and constantly stuck in a make-believe social battleground for attention and recognition. Unfortunately, no matter how much I hate that awful time and place, how much I want to leave all the painful memories behind to move on with my life, I simply can’t. I can’t because there is still someone, a ghost of my past, an apparition of my regret, chaining me to a small high school in the countryside.

Ivy and I were best friends from childhood. I had always been the oddball, struggling to find my place in any class since kindergarten. Ivy, meanwhile, was a social butterfly who could immediately captivate anyone she met. Yet, despite our contradictory natures, we were thick as thieves. 

Upon entering teenage years, however, something changed in our relationship. My feelings toward Ivy were no longer those of a mere friend. I realized I love her. Even so, I never mustered the courage to confess, partly because I was a coward, but mostly because I thought two girls like us wouldn’t have any future in our heavily conservative community. I decided to withhold my love for Ivy so as not to damage our friendship. That choice was my gravest agony, haunting me for the rest of my days.
 
Ivy took her own life not long after we entered our senior year. Apparently, her parents found out she had been pregnant and cut ties with her, pushing Ivy to a desperate decision. Her funeral was perfunctory. As I said, we lived in a heavily conservative community where people’s faith blinded their humanity, and Ivy just committed two of the greatest sins: getting pregnant before marriage and taking her own life. Nobody grieved for Ivy - nobody except for me. 

I left my hometown soon after, but I returned every year to tend Ivy’s grave for the last eight years. This year, I was cleaning her faded gravestone when I noticed a strange black envelope stuck to its back. It was an odd sight, as no one else ever visited Ivy besides me, not even her own family. Even stranger, the envelope was addressed to me by name. Inside was a small piece of paper, written in a style identical to my friend’s: “Meet me in the classroom. Signed, Ivy.”

I furiously stormed to my former high school. I didn’t know who left that note and what they wanted from me. Maybe it was a cruel prank by an old classmate. Perhaps it was some criminals luring me in to rob me dry. I couldn’t care less. They dared to mock my friend’s tragedy, to mock our friendship, and all I wanted was to make them pay.

It was winter break, so the building was void of any students. I bribed the security staff to let me in with a few bucks and an excuse about wanting to reminisce. After making my way through barren hallways, I was shocked to find a group of people in my old classroom. Eleven adults were sitting on school desks with attached chairs that were too small for them. Their expressions showed stress and anxiety, yet also focus. There was an empty desk in a corner, so I suspect they were still waiting for one more person.   

The situation’s bizareness caught me off guard, diverting me from my anger. Was this a class reunion, a filming set, or some nostalgia therapy group? I almost turned around and left them alone before noticing a certain someone. Sitting next to the empty desk was a beautiful young girl with round blue eyes and smooth, long black hair. She wore a simple, white dress and cream jacket that complemented her blushing skin. Her face, even when nervous, still radiated an aura of joy and kindness, the energy I knew too well.

As if hypnotized, I rushed toward the girl and aggressively grabbed her hand while shouting Ivy’s name outloud. For a moment, I honestly thought it was my friend returning to me in a hyper-realistic dream of sorts. I immediately realized my mistake as the girl looked up to me, full of awkwardness and confusion. At a closer look, her blue eyes were a shade darker than my friend’s.

“Uh, hi, uhm, my name is Rachel. You must have mistaken me for someone else, haha…”

“I, uhm, I thought you were someone I knew… I’ll, uhm, leave you and your friends to, uhm, whatever you guys are doing. Sorry for the trouble!” I clumsily apologized, cursing my social ineptitude.

“Hey, no worry! I was just a little startled!” Rachel gave me a sympathetic smile. “I’m not blaming you. Everyone here has their own story, after all!”

“Right. So anyway, I’m leav…”

Before I could finish my sentence, a sudden chill ran down my spine, freezing me in place. Something just entered the classroom. My eyes told me it was a middle-aged bald man in casual business attire, wearing thick glasses. Every other part of my body, down to the most minuscule cell, instinctively told me that thing was not human. I felt as if I was a mouse facing an eagle, a rabbit facing a tiger, a prey facing its predator. 

“Class will soon begin. All students must return to their seats! Standing up during class is a rule violation and will result in severe disciplinary actions.” 

The entity spoke in an otherworldly dominant voice, echoing inside and bending my mind to its will. As much as I wanted to get out of there, I had no other choice but to sit down on the remaining desk. 

“Very good. Now then, since everyone’s here, let’s start the lesson with a quick introduction. My name is Thoth, and I’ll be your homeroom teacher for this class, the ‘Secrets of the Universe 101.’ By the end of this course, students will learn a secret knowledge of the universe that no other living human should have known. The curriculum consists of three lessons, extending over three days, including today. The first two classes will have practical homework. On the final day, we’ll have a short exam to determine if you are qualified to pass the course. You can only acquire the secret you design after completing all three lessons and the final exam. Any questions so far?”

I had many questions, but my mouth was too trembled to speak up. However, as scared as I was, my mind had already started processing the situation. Thoth was clearly not human, so he must either be a pagan god or a demon. If my knowledge of the occult through media were applicable, I would have a very high chance of dying and getting my soul trapped for eternity. Still, if I made it through the whole ordeal, I could finally learn why Ivy had to die, who was responsible, and how to exact my vengeance on them. Were these answers worth risking my life for? Did I have any other choice? I wondered to myself as Thoth continued his speech.

“Now then, I will go over the class rules. I highly suggest memorizing them by heart because failing to comply will result in severe disciplinary action, or, in your kind’s words, death. There are five rules as follows:
- No talking, eating, sleeping, or standing up and moving around during classes!
- You will work in pairs to finish your assignments before the next class. If one of you fails, the other will suffer the same fate.
- You can drop out at any time, consequence-free, after finishing your homework. Just don’t show up to the next class, and I’ll just assume you quit. However, if you continue to show up but your partner doesn’t, well, it’s such to be you.
- You can ask for outside help with your assignments.
- The secret you learn at the course’s end will be decided by your heart. Only those with a worthy strength of heart may receive their answers.

As for the pairing, the closest person to your side will be your partner, simple as that.”

So, Rachel was going to be my partner, just what I needed! I turned and awkwardly waved at her, hoping to give a friendly signal, despite still being ashamed of what I had done before. Rachel smiled and waved back at me, easing my embarrassment. 

I was going to introduce myself to Rachel when suddenly, the two people sitting in front of us’s heads exploded. I had to force my mouth closed using two hands to prevent any scream from slipping out. Apparently, one of them was doing the exact same thing I had intended to do, which violated the first rule of no talking in class. It could have been me had I spoken up just a second sooner. Even with blood splashed all over my face and clothes, I sat motionless in fear, afraid of moving even one muscle. Around me, a heavy atmosphere fell over the classroom as others also realized the fragility of their lives. Still, the teacher couldn’t care less about the incident and proceeded with his lesson.  

**Lesson 1: How to survive when facing a primordial god.**

“Primordial deities are divine cosmic entities possessing nigh omniscient and omnipotent capability, representing the most fundamental forces creating the universe. Despite their immense power, progenitor gods of opposing natures have constantly struggled against each other in perpetual conflicts since the dawn of time, creating a delicate balance that limits their influence on the material plane, allowing your universe to survive and thrive…”

“... by distributing pieces of their aspects among servants to do their bidding, primordial gods can affect the mortal world in hope of tipping the scales against their primal rivals…”

“... a progenitor deity’s domain is where their servants have the strongest connection to the master and thus are the most powerful…”  

Thot kept going on and on with his lecture, most of which I couldn’t understand and refused to digest. Instead, my mind sank into the sea of its own horrifying thoughts. After an eternity, our teacher finally finished monologuing. I expected him to explain the homework, but Thot just dismissed the class, and with a snap of his finger, the whole classroom vanished into thin air.

I found myself alone in an empty classroom. Every desk except for mine was neatly stored at the back, showing no sign of recent usage. I looked around for Rachel, but she had also disappeared without a trace. My brain struggled to process what had just happened, wondering if it was all a nightmare. 

A security guard came and hurried me out, saying he had seen me dozing off all afternoon but was too embarrassed to wake me. So, the ‘Secrets of the Universe 101’ class was just a nightmare reflecting my disdain for high school. But then something felt wrong. That’s right, blood from before still covered my entire body. That meant I actually attended that strange class. 

“Hey, er, I was thinking if you notice anything different about my appearance?” I probed.

“What do you mean? Oh, are you flirting with me? Hehe, alright, I’m free tonight, so why don’t we go out for a cup of coffee?”

“No, I mean, how can you not see that I’m covered in blood!?” 

The guard’s face fell, figuratively at first. A nanosecond later, his face literally fell onto the floor like a skin mask, revealing a blob of muscle and blood where it was supposed to be. The guard’s entire body started mutating. Giant flesh tendrils pierced out of his limbs. His skin and muscle melted together into a black, viscous substance. His bones stretched upward, snapped rapidly, and then healed back as the guard became a giant, slimy abomination covered in goo and tentacles. The environment outside the classroom also changed, revealing a hellish landscape of ruined buildings, black sludge, and horrendous monsters, enveloped by a sickening green sky. 

“You think you’re so smart, puny human? I could have given you a merciful death had you just walked out. But now, it will be a long and painful one! Thot’s little game won’t protect you much longer! You are in my master’s domain now!” 

Even without a mouth, the monster released horrendous screams by vibrating its body. It slammed tentacles into an invisible barrier covering the doorframe, shaking up the entire room. The presence of this thing, despite not being as overwhelming as Thot’s, still terrified me to my core. As the walls started cracking down, I could do nothing but huddle into a ball, awaiting my inevitable doom. 

Suddenly, a roaring gunshot stopped the monster in its tracks. It was Rachel holding a dessert eagle outside. She emptied her magazine, temporarily stunning the mutated guard. A  new sense of hope bloomed in my heart, allowing my body to move again. I wasted no time jumping out of the classroom and toward Rachel. We raced for another ruin as the monstrosity chased right after us. Rachel kept reloading her gun and unloading bullets at our pursuer while also avoiding puddles of black goo on our way. I would never have imagined a delicate girl like her could handle a gun in such a skillful manner.

Despite my lungs almost giving out on me, we managed to cut off the guard by hiding inside an abandoned convenience store. It was my first chance to rest after entering that bizarre classroom and to speak to Rachel properly.

“Hey, thanks for saving my life. I owe you one!” 

“Don’t mention it. Besides, our lives depend on each other now, so let’s do our best to keep each other alive, okay!”

“Agree! But like, what was that thing?”

“The monster chasing us? Probably just some parasite leeching on the master of this domain. Lucky for us, it wasn’t a real servant, or we’d already be dead. But we'd better hurry and get out of here before an actual one shows up.”

“Cool, cool! But how do we get out of here?”

“You don’t remember what our teacher said during class?”

“I got a little distracted…”

“Distracted? You went through all the trouble preparing the ritual just to throw your life away on the first day by being distracted?”

“What ritual?” 

“What do you mean? The ritual to access the Secret of the Universe, of course! Why else are you here?”

For the hundredth or so time of the day, I was shocked and confused. I told Rachel I didn’t know of any ritual, which made her equally baffled. Still, we decided it was best to find our way out first before continuing this discussion.

“Okay, so according to the lesson, the only way to survive a primordial god is to call upon protection from their complementary opposition, i.e., another primal deity of reversed nature. To invoke their power, carve out their sigil on any surface with living blood, then pray to them.” Rachel explained, pulling out a notebook containing various sigils she had noted during class. 

“Can we be sure they’d answer?”

“Not really. But Thoth said if a primordial is directly targeting you, their adversary’ll be more likely to help out. Think of it as another way for them to mess with each other. Real mature, if you ask me.” 

“So I guess the first secret of the universe is that our creators are a bunch of tantrum-throwing babies. No wonder lives suck ass!”

“Amen, sister! Amen! Anyway, we need to pinpoint who to call before drawing the sigil. Any idea…”

Before Rachel could finish her sentence, the ground trembled. The entire building, including ourselves, flew upward. Above us was a vast sea of black sludge hanging upside down. Except, it wasn’t a sea, it was an open mouth of some snake, worm thing so humongous, I couldn’t even make sense of its head. This entity sucking us up was a real servant, unlike the parasite we had faced before, and we stood no chance. Our body hit the slime, and we started to drown hundreds of feet above the air.

Strangely enough, dying this way almost felt nostalgic. It was a feeling I had constantly experienced for a long time following Ivy’s death. ‘Sink into depression’ may just be a figure of speech, but the sense of hopelessness and suffocation was so real, as if I were sinking in actual water. Worse, even if I wanted to move on, depression still clung to me, dragging me back down, like sticky glue. Being engulfed in this black substance felt exactly the same.

“Can this be the nature of the god we’re fighting? But how can depression be a fundamental force of the universe? Regardless, I must try!” 

I struggled my way to the surface and reached for Rachel’s note. After frantically searching, I finally found something: Apoph, the god of darkness and negativity (including negative emotions), opposed by Amon, the god of light and positivity. Grabbing the nearest piece of brick, I carved Amon’s sigil onto my own palm and prayed. I didn’t know what the correct invocation was. I just prayed I got to live another day so there would still be someone alive to remember Ivy. 

Everything went black, and then a blinding light filled the sky. All of a sudden, I found myself in front of my old high school’s gate. There was no slime, no monster, only Rachel by my side, gasping for air.

Eventually, **Miss P and Mr X hooked up on Mr X’s birthday**, while he was still in a relationship. My boyfriend and I actually **witnessed this whole thing develop over months**. My boyfriend used to update me about everything, and we both judged their behavior heavily. He **disliked them and considered their actions immoral**.

Fast forward a few months:

* Mr X got a job and moved to **City L**
* Miss P stayed back initially (not sure why)
* Around November, she also moved to City L
* They didn’t live together (some issue according to my bf) some leasing problems

Now recently, **my boyfriend also moved to City L for work**. He rented a private room in a house.

The incident:  
yesterday evening , I asked him to call me once he got off work so we could talk. He **didn’t call**. When I woke up and called him, he **cut my call** and just texted **“wait.”**

Around **40 minutes later**, he called back while returning from somewhere. When I asked where he was, he said:

>

Then he casually told me that **he called her, asked to meet, and had just come back from meeting her**.

I was shocked.

He said:

* They went for **coffee**
* Walked around the area
* She showed him the neighborhood
* She **invited him to her room**, but he claims he refused

He said he met her because:

* He’s new in the city
* He has **no friends**
* He wanted to “get back in the friend group”
* Mr X (his ex-roommate) hadn’t been meeting him the last 2 times
* Miss P was the **only one responding**, so he went ahead

What bothered me:

* He **did not inform me beforehand**
* He **cut my call instead of explaining**
* He chose to meet **this specific girl alone**
* He suddenly started saying things like *“She lives nearby so we can hang out”* — despite previously **hating her**

When I questioned him, he got defensive and said things like:

>

He then brought up how he’s **saving money for our wedding**, and said:

>

That felt like **emotional pressure**, not reassurance.

Later, I had a gut feeling and asked him:

>

He got shocked and said:

>

Turns out:

* She suggested they **go to the gym together**
* She suggested that since both hate their rooms, they should **rent a flat together**

This made me completely lose it.

When I questioned this further, he **lost his patience**, got angry, and actually **removed some money from the wedding fund**, saying:

>

This behavior is **completely new**. He has **never**:

* Hung out with another girl alone without informing me
* Used money or marriage as leverage during arguments
* Got hostile instead of reassuring me

To make things more confusing, later that evening, **Mr X finally texted him**, saying he’d meet and they could all go out on Saturday. My boyfriend then said:

>

He keeps insisting:

* He just wants friends
* These are the only people he knows in the city
* I should trust him because “you know me”

But I’m deeply disturbed by:

* His sudden change in behavior
* His willingness to get close to **someone we both knew had boundary issues**
* His defensiveness
* Using marriage savings as a threat
* Ignoring my discomfort instead of addressing it

I feel **heartbroken, confused, and unsafe emotionally**.

1qvkeni,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qvkeni/being_tired_for_reasons_sleep_cant_fix/,Being Tired for Reasons Sleep Can’t Fix,"I love how the day always ends with hope. Like, tonight is the night. I’m going to bed early. I’m going to be responsible. I’ll crash at 10 p.m. sharp, full eight hours, no doomscrolling, no “one last episode.” I’ll wake up refreshed, glowing, reborn. A new person. A person who drinks water and stretches.

Then morning comes. Alarm rings. And my body wakes up, sure, but my soul stays in bed like, no, you go ahead. I feel like I got hit by a truck, but not the dramatic, movie kind. More like the slow, bureaucratic kind. The kind that runs you over, backs up, checks paperwork, then runs you over again just to be sure. Eight hours of sleep. Still tired. Wild. Seriously.

That’s when you realize this isn’t the sleepy tired. This is the other one. The one sleep doesn’t touch. The kind of tired that laughs at melatonin.

Everyone loves to talk about work-life balance. Companies especially. They’ll slap it on posters, email signatures, maybe a Zoom background. “Wellness Wednesday.” “Mental Health Matters.” Free yoga once a quarter, but only during lunch break, and please be back on time. Meanwhile, the real exhaustion isn’t from staying late. It’s from smiling at a boss who drains the room the moment they open their mouth. It’s from nodding in meetings that could’ve been an email, but weren’t, because apparently everyone needed to “align.” Align to what, exactly? Our shared confusion?

You spend the whole day pretending to care at a level that deserves an Oscar. You throw in a “Sounds good!” and a thumbs-up emoji like it costs nothing. It costs something. It costs battery. Emotional battery. And yours has been stuck at 3% since February.

Monday emails hit different. You open your inbox and feel your stomach drop, even if nothing bad is there. It’s just the anticipation. The “what fresh nonsense is waiting for me today” feeling. Team chats light up with “Good morning, team! Let’s crush it!” and you reply “Good morning!” because that’s what functional adults do, but inside you’re already planning your escape to a life where emails don’t exist and mornings are just mornings.

You come home and there’s another shift waiting. Family wants stories. Kids want energy. Roommates want conversation. Someone asks, “How was your day?” and you do the math. Do I give the real answer, or the short one that keeps the peace? You choose the short one. “I’m fine.” Classic. Polite, efficient lying.

Then you scroll. Because of course you do. And suddenly everyone else is thriving. New job. New business. New body. New beach. Smiling faces, soft lighting, captions about gratitude. Meanwhile your highlight reel didn’t load. Probably deleted. You start wondering if you missed a life update where everyone else figured it out and you were in the bathroom when it happened.

They say sleep is the best medicine. Yeah, tell that to the anxiety that wakes up before your alarm. Must be nice if problems could just sleep peacefully. I’ve had full ten-hour sleeps and still felt like I needed another vacation, not from work, but from my own head. My body’s rested. My thoughts are not. They’re running laps at 4 a.m. like they’re training for something.

I’m not innocent here. I’m the guy who says “I’m fine” like it’s a personality trait. I’m the genius who thinks one more coffee can fix an existential crisis. I’ve looked at my calendar, seen it packed wall to wall, and said, “I can handle it.” Then wondered later why everything feels heavy. I thought being tired was just part of being an adult. Like taxes. Or back pain. Or pretending you enjoy small talk.

But there’s a deeper tired that sneaks up on you. The tired from carrying things you never talk about. The regrets you keep folded neatly in the back of your mind. The plans you postponed so long they quietly expired. The pressure to be resilient, to be resourceful, to push through. We love those words. Endure. Hustle. Grind. They sound strong. They don’t ask follow-up questions.

No one really asks how you’re holding up. They ask if you’re busy. As if busy automatically means okay. As if productivity is proof of wellness. So you translate your feelings into something acceptable. You don’t say, “I’m exhausted in a way that scares me.” You say, “Just a bit tired.” You make it smaller so it fits the room.

And that translation is tiring. Constantly editing yourself. Adjusting tone. Making sure you’re not “too much.” Laughing at jokes you don’t find funny because it’s easier than explaining why you’re quiet today. You start to forget what unedited feels like.

The wild part is, from the outside, everything looks fine. You show up. You deliver. You function. So even you start doubting yourself. You think, maybe I’m just weak. Maybe everyone feels this and I’m just bad at handling it. So you double down. You push harder. You add another layer of pretending on top of the old one.

Until even the pretending gets heavy.

That’s the moment that scares you a little. When rest doesn’t help. When weekends disappear too fast. When Sunday night feels like a countdown instead of a break. When you’re not even sad exactly, just numb and tired and weirdly angry at nothing in particular.

No inspirational quote fixes that. No “just be grateful” speech. Sometimes all you can do is notice it. Name it. Admit that this tired has reasons. And those reasons don’t fit neatly into sick leave forms or productivity apps.

Maybe the real problem isn’t how many hours we sleep. Maybe it’s how many hours we spend pretending we’re okay. Smiling through it. Powering through it. Carrying it quietly so we don’t inconvenience anyone. Because you can only run on empty for so long before even the act of pretending starts to feel like work.

And when that happens, you start wondering, half-joking but not really: if rest can’t fix this, and pretending makes it worse, what’s left to put down first?",1,1770198567.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

To give proper background, I’ll use fake names.

There was my boyfriend’s **ex-roommate (Mr X)** and a girl **(Miss P)**. Mr X had a **long-distance girlfriend** at the time. Miss P studied in the same university and initially started hanging out with them, saying she just wanted to be friends.

Over time, Miss P and Mr X grew closer:

Like the title says ; im gonna message my (19m) ex gf (19) of 1.5 years tommorow evening. She broke up with me about 1.5 months ago. She was pretty hostile at first but whenever we have messaged recently she seemed quite nice. I plan on leading the conversation to a really low pressure coffee invitation. I really hope it goes well. We are eachothers first bf/gf and i wanna try again. Not aiming to talk about anything deep with her , just light topics to open up our line of communication again. 

The message i plan on sending is this:“Hey Liv, hope you’ve been doing well.Random question,  do you know any good coffee spots like black sheep coffee (this is a memory we share) nearby? I’ve been meaning to try some nicer ones.” 

If she responds well ill try give her an subtle invitation. 
If the message goes well ill request her on insta either after messaging or after meeting.

She had also viewed my tiktok profile after our most recent conversation , which she hadnt done before. If
If you want more context on the break up look at my profile.

What do you think ? 


* update* i ended up sending this message ""Hey Liv, hope you're well. I finished rayman legends earlier and it reminded me of when we used to play. It made me smile. What have you been up to ? "" 

The conversation was pretty dry and just when i was about to react to her reply and end the conversation instead of dragging it out , she double messages saying she got a belly piercing and even sent a photo of it. Her replies became instant. I complimented her on it , and asked general questions about it. She then asked me about my new tattoo( why i got it etc etc) then she went dry soon after. I ended up reacting to her chat instead of dragging the conversation on too long. 

Im thinking of messaging her again in 4 days, not sure exactly what. Maybe something about a bar she recommended i go before we broke up. I recently started going to after we ended things.

What do you all think ? Is there a chance shes interested in reconnecting ? Think its a good idea to message her in 4 days?

I go to the gym at least 4 days a week and do 15 minutes of cardio on the treadmill, jogging at an 8:00/mile pace each day. I’ve always had intermittent Tinnitus with a higher pitch but it has now evolved into something low toned and more predictable as it usually accompanies the rest of my symptoms.

I am diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, which has been dormant for the past 15 years. When it was active, I never had these symptoms and the test results have no pointed to it being the cause

Whenever I am about to go to sleep, somewhere between 10-11pm, I’ve noticed my veins becoming more apparent. In addition, I sometimes have quick heart flutters, but not to an alarming extent.

But This has been going on for at least a month now and it’s bothered me so much to the point where I just could not sleep until like 2am because of how uncomfortable my symptoms, especially my pronounced veins, made me feel. At the beginning it was so bad, it also had me waking up at around 5am, even after going to sleep at 2am. I’ve been to the doctors about 3 times for the tinnitus, cardio, and Gerd symptoms, where they’ve given me an EKG, CBC, and everything came back normal. My heart rate was a little low, but the doctor explained that’s mostly because of how active I am. Ive also noticed this is worst when I eat at night (especially white rice), around 8-9pm, prior to sleep. As a result, I’ve stopped eating at night.

1qvk8hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tranquilindiaglobal/comments/1qvk8hg/why_modern_interiors_are_choosing_pet_acoustic/,Why Modern Interiors Are Choosing PET Acoustic Panels,"https://preview.redd.it/f8ej2ty57ghg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=38491a44a1878af60b324c69bdb3cb891beea2d9

When you walk into a coffee shop that looks really nice or a fancy office or a fancy hotel lobby you will see something. These places are not just nice to look at. They are also really quiet. Even though they have a lot of surfaces and you can see everything the sound, in these places is soft and easy to listen to. The sound is also very clear and comfortable to hear. You can talk to people. You will be able to hear them easily which is really nice.



This is not an accident. It is a design secret. The secret is easy to see. The chances are that the calm and peaceful atmosphere is made possible by acoustic panels. PET acoustic panels are likely the reason why the atmosphere’s so serene.



You will see these panels on the walls as really cool geometric art or you will see them overhead as a floating ceiling made of PET panels. People call these panels many different things, like [PET polyester acoustic panels](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/pet-acoustic-panels.html) or acoustic PET panels but the effect they have is the same. The acoustic PET panels are really important, for design and here is why the acoustic PET panels are so popular.

# The Modern Design Problem: Beautiful, but Noisy



Let us set the scene. When we think of homes we think of how great they look with simple decorations. We really like the look of concrete big glass windows, shiny floors and plain walls. The contemporary interiors and the minimalist drywall and the polished floors and the exposed concrete all look really great.. What about the sound? The contemporary interiors with the exposed concrete and the big glass windows and the minimalist drywall and the polished floors are not good, for sound.



These materials are really good at bouncing sound. When sound waves hit them they jump back like a ball, in a game. This makes a lot of noise like a mess of sounds people talking all at once and a constant humming noise. This is what happens when we have something called reverberation. Reverberation is a problem because it makes people tired when they listen they do not get much work done and the space feels really crazy even if it looks nice. The reverberation is what causes all these problems.



The old solutions just did not feel right. They had bulky foam, metal with holes in it that looked like it was, from a factory or fabrics that seemed old. Designers of the solutions had to pick between how the solutions looked and what the solutions could do. The old solutions often clashed with the vibe of the solutions.



I am looking at PET panels that’re acoustic. The people who made panels acoustic found the answer to the problem. They figured out the equation, for PET panels acoustic.

# Reason 1



The company is a story about being good to the earth that you can really see happening with the sustainability efforts of the company. This is a part of what the company is doing with sustainability. The company is making a difference, with sustainability.



Today design is a responsibility. People who buy things and the people they are for want to know that the things in their space are good for them and the world. The materials used should have a story behind them. [PET acoustic panels](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/pet-acoustic-panels.html) really do this. They show that the materials, in our space can be good and have a story. PET acoustic panels are an example of this.



Most of the materials are made from recycled -consumer plastics. Think about water bottles that are diverted from landfills. These water bottles are melted down. Then spun into dense fibers that absorb sound. This is not a claim that the materials are eco-friendly. The process of making these materials is direct and circular it is a process. The post-consumer plastics, like the water bottles are recycled and used to make these sound-absorbing fibers.



When you are a designer picking these panels is a way to get certified with LEED or other programs that focus on green buildings. The people who use the space will really like it. The PET panel ceiling is not just pretty and quiet it is also a sign that the person who chose it really thought about what they were doing with the materials. The PET panel ceiling is a choice because it looks good and it is good, for the environment.

# Reason 2



# Unmatched Design Flexibility (Goodbye, Boring Beige)



This is the place where really cool things happen for people who like to create stuff. We do not have to use those boring foam things anymore. Now we have these sound panels made of PET polyester and they are like a brand new piece of paper for designers to work with. The polyester acoustic panels are really great, for designers because they can make them look however they want.

These things come wrapped in much any color or pattern of fabric you can think of. You want a bright burnt orange felt for a wall? That is possible. You need your company logo put into a wall in the lobby in a way? That can be done. They can be cut into custom shapes like circles or hexagons or weird shapes.

Put together to make really cool 3D art installations. Fabric colors and patterns are very versatile. You can make a wall with fabric in a burnt orange color. Corporate logos can be put into lobby walls with fabric. Custom shapes, like hexagons can be made with fabric. Used to make 3D art.

The acoustic solution is what really makes the room look nice. The panels do not just fit in with everything they make the space look better. A PET panel ceiling can change from a tile that just does its job into a beautiful sculpture that looks like a cloud.

# Reason 3



Solar panels can go where other solar panels can not go. For example solar panels can work well in weather. Hello humidity is not a problem, for panels. Solar panels can be used in places where it’s really humid.

**Here is a big deal for projects:** *moisture resistance.* The old type of materials like wood panels or some kinds of mineral wool can get all bent out of shape or sag or even get mold on them when it is damp. This is a problem because moisture can really hurt these materials. Moisture resistance is important for projects because it helps materials, like wood panels or mineral wool last longer.

PET panels that are acoustic are naturally really good, at keeping water. They do not soak up water all. This means that [PET panels acoustic](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/pet-acoustic-panels.html) can now be used in a lot of different ways:

* That stunning restaurant with an open kitchen
* The spa, pool area, or luxury locker room
* Exterior covered walkways
* High-humidity regions

Designers do not have to worry about limitations. They can now put high quality sound systems in places that get wet or are really tough on equipment, like bathrooms or swimming pools without thinking about it. Designers can bring acoustics into these wet and demanding environments.

# Reason 4



# Health and Hygiene Built-in



People really care about their health. Wellbeing these days. Wellness-centric design is no longer something that’s just popular it is something that people need. PET panels are very good at helping with this. They support wellness-centric design in a smooth way. [PET panels](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/pet-acoustic-panels.html) are really useful, for wellness-centric design.

The fibers are safe. They do not cause any irritation. They are different, from some materials because the fibers do not send bad things into the air. The fibers are also very easy to take care of. The fibers have surfaces that are covered with fabric and these surfaces do not catch dust or things that can make people sick. You can clean the fibers by using a vacuum cleaner by wiping them with a cloth.

In places like schools and healthcare facilities and offices having air and being able to clean easily is a big plus. Clean air and easy cleaning are good for the health of the people who use these spaces, like schools and offices. This is because clean air and easy cleaning help keep people healthy.

# Reason 5



# Simple, Clean Installation



We should remember the people who build these spaces. Contractors and installers really like PET panels. A lot of systems are made to be efficient. PET panels can be very light they can use a clip-in grid system or people can stick them on with adhesives. PET panels are very useful, for contractors and installers.

This means that the job site will be less crazy things will get done faster and we can budget better. If something is hard to put in people usually decide it is not worth the trouble. They find something else. But PET panels are easy to install so they usually stay in the plan. [PET panels](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/pet-acoustic-panels.html) are a choice because they are easy, for the people who install them to work with and that means PET panels often stay in the plan.

# The Main Point is This: This Tool Fixes a Lot of Issues



This tool is really good because it can fix problems that we have.

* The tool is very helpful. It makes our life easier.
* We can use this tool to fix things.
* This tool fixes a lot of issues. That is why it is so useful.
* We like this tool because it solves problems and it is easy to use.

When we think about designing the inside of a house it is not about choosing one color or one piece of furniture. It is, about finding things that can do a lot of jobs. PET acoustic panels are an example of this idea. They can do things at the same time, which is really useful. [PET acoustic panels](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/pet-acoustic-panels.html) are the example of something that can do many jobs and make the inside of a house look and sound great.



***They are not merely a sound fix. They are:***



1. A sustainability credential
2. A key aesthetic element
3. A durable material for tough spaces
4. A contributor to indoor wellness
5. A practical choice for builders

Designers do not have to make sacrifices with these things. They do not have to choose between quiet and beauty or, between sustainability and performance. Designers can have designers get the best of designers design with beauty and sustainability and performance all at the same time. Designers can really have everything designers want with designers design.



***So next time you’re in a beautifully quiet modern space, look up. Look at the walls. That sense of calm you’re feeling? It’s by design. And it’s likely thanks to the quiet revolution of PET panels from Tranquil Global.*** [***Enquire now***](https://tranquilglobal.com/)***!***",1,1770197913.0,u_tranquilindiaglobal,0,1.0,False

Some counterarguments I can think of:

1. ""They didn't have time to search every building in an entire district as they were on alert for the Scouts to come to them"" Bertholdt, Reiner, and Zeke spent most of the time sitting on the walls drinking coffee, and the latter two even had time to fight in titan form once. Hell, Pieck was around and probably could have found it in under a day in Cart form. There were Marleyan soldiers on the island as well - they could have formed a search team. Not like they were doing anything else.
2. ""Zeke didn't want it to get out that Eren was his brother and the basement's contents would have confirmed it"" The Marleyan military already knows Grisha is Zeke's father and would have likely deduced something was up when Gross and Kruger's ship didn't return from the island. If Zeke didn't want the other 3 Warriors finding out, he could have gone in alone after they found it.
3. ""They didn't see it as necessary as long as they captured Eren."" Surely a failsafe wouldn't hurt? Heck, it'd make more sense to destroy whatever was in the basement than it did for Reiner and Annie to kill Sawney and Bean!

Edit: Counter 4: ""It'd still take too long to find it"" Then have the 4 warriors transform and destroy everything. Eventually the Yeager's basement would get crushed as well.",0,1770197820.0,ShingekiNoKyojin,31,0.5,False

Two semesters in, here’s a reality check no brochure prepares you for.

**Expectation:**  
You’ll become a strategic thinker who speaks in frameworks and makes billion-dollar decisions.  
**Reality:**  
You spend 3 hours deciding whether this is a “case question” or a “discussion point” while your coffee gets cold.

**Expectation:**  
Classes will be intellectually stimulating debates with professors guiding the discussion.  
**Reality:**  
Half the class is preparing for quizzes, one-fourth is networking on LinkedIn, and the rest are calculating relative grading in their heads.

**Expectation:**  
You’ll finally have a balanced, disciplined lifestyle.  
**Reality:**  
Your sleep schedule is a joke, dinner happens at 2 a.m., and you measure time in “deliverables”.

**Expectation:**  
Placements will reward hard work and merit.  
**Reality:**  
Hard work helps, but luck, shortlists, prior work-ex, and interview vibes matter more than anyone admits.

**Expectation:**  
Everyone around you will be collaborative and supportive.  
**Reality:**  
People are nice, but competition is always in the room — silently, politely, constantly.

**Expectation:**  
MBA will magically make you confident and sorted.  
**Reality:**  
It magnifies your insecurities first, then (slowly) teaches you how to manage them.

That said — no regrets.  
You learn more about **people, pressure, and yourself** here than anywhere else.  
It’s messy, intense, and sometimes exhausting… but it does change how you think.

MBA isn’t a glow-up.  
It’s more like a stress test.

1qvk1lr,https://i.redd.it/qgbuv29g4ghg1.jpeg,"Old trails, fresh blood.","The sun hangs low over the academy, turning the grass gold and the shadows long. Arthur Morgan is sitting on a nearby bench, coffee in hand. He gazes his eyes around the academy, calm—but alert. Arthur always is.

He hears the footsteps before he sees him.

Slow. Careful. Familiar.

Arthur straightens, one hand resting near his revolver, though he doesn’t draw. When John suddenly comes into view, his breath catches despite himself.

“John.”

John Marston stands there for a moment, like he’s not sure if he’s welcome in the world anymore. He looks older than Arthur remembers—harder. Not just from time, but from weight.

John’s voice comes easy, almost too easy.  
“Well I’ll be damned. Thought you were dead. Again.”

Arthur lets out a quiet huff, forcing a crooked smile.  
“Yeah… folk keep sayin’ that.”

Arthur gestures toward the bench with his chin.  
“You ridin’ with ghosts now, or you gonna come sit?”

John hesitates—just a fraction of a second too long. Then he walks over, every step measured. He keeps his coat closed, hands visible. Friendly. Careful.

Arthur notices all of it.

They sit next to each other, the silence crackling between them like a third presence that doesn’t trust either man.

John‘s hand shakes—barely—but Arthur sees it anyway.

“So,” Arthur says, staring into the sky, “last I heard, you were playin’ family man. Rancher. Law-abidin’ citizen.”

John swallows.  
“Tryin’ to be.”

Arthur smiles faintly.  
“World don’t usually let folks like us do that.”

There’s silence. Wind through the grass. A bird calling somewhere far off.

John finally speaks, voice low.  
“You been keepin’ a low profile?”

Arthur chuckles.  
“As low as a man with my face can. Ain’t hurtin’ no one who don’t deserve it.”

John nods. That answer hurts more than a lie would’ve.

Arthur looks at him now—really looks.  
“You alright, John? You got that look. Like you’re ridin’ with a rope round your neck, just waitin’ for someone else to pull it tight.”

John forces another smile, wider this time. Practiced.  
“Guess I learned from the best.”

Arthur’s eyes soften—but there’s suspicion there too. He doesn’t miss the way John keeps angling his body. The way his right hand never strays far from his holster.

Still… Arthur doesn’t call him on it.

“Listen,” Arthur says, voice quieter now, “whatever you’re mixed up in—if it’s trouble—you don’t gotta shoulder it alone. Not with me.”

John’s chest tightens. For a second, the act almost breaks.

Almost.

He nods slowly.  
“Good to know.”

They talk like old times after that. About horses. Umas. About places they’ve ridden. About nothing that matters, because neither of them dares touch what *does*.

As dusk settles in, John stands.  
“I oughta get goin’. Got a way’s to go.""

Arthur rises too.  
“Yeah. Me too.”

They stand there, facing each other. Two men shaped by the same past—now pointing toward different ends of it.

Arthur reaches out, claps John on the shoulder. Solid. Trusting.  
“Was good seein’ you, brother.”

The word *brother* lands like a bullet John doesn’t dodge.

John meets his eyes, jaw tight.  
“Yeah… good seein’ you too, Arthur.”

He slowly turns around, and walks off. not once looking back.

Arthur watches until John disappears behind a wall. Then his hand drifts—slowly—to his revolver.

He doesn’t draw it.

But he doesn’t relax either.

Somewhere far away, John walks with a friendly smile still on his face… and Agent Ross’s voice rattling in his skull, counting down the days Arthur Morgan has left.

Arthur slowly sinks back down onto the bench, as he leans over and rests a hand on his forehead.

Dear Friends, Kind Strangers, and Compassionate Hearts,

I never thought I would have to write something like this. My loving mum — the woman who has always been my strength, my comfort, and my safe place — is now in the fight of her life. About a month ago, our world was turned upside down when she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, an aggressive form of cancer that has spread throughout her body.

This illness has taken so much from her. She can no longer walk without help. She can no longer care for herself the way she once could. Each day is a battle — for breath, for strength, and for even a brief moment without pain. Yet despite everything, she continues to fight with courage, hope, and a quiet determination that inspires me every single day.

But we can’t do this alone. Her treatments, medications, and essential care are almost entirely out-of-pocket, and the costs are far more than we can manage. Without help, she cannot get the treatments she needs to have a fighting chance.

Your support can truly make a difference. Every dollar raised will go directly toward:

• Urgently needed cancer treatments and medications

• Pain management,  physical therapy and home assistance

No matter the amount — whether it’s the cost of a cup of coffee or a month’s rent — every gift matters. Each donation is more than money; it’s a message of love and solidarity that says, “You are not alone in this fight.” If you’ve ever watched someone you love suffer and wished you could take away their pain, you understand the ache in our hearts right now. Today, you have the power to bring light into this darkness. Please take my mum’s hand, walk this road with us, and be part of her fight for life.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your kindness, your prayers, and your generosity. Your compassion means more than words can express, and I pray it returns to you a hundredfold.

With love and gratitude,

Chelsea Ekpe

Perfect for a slow afternoon away from the crowds.

**Zabeel Park**  
This one is huge and has plenty of walking and jogging paths. You can also find playgrounds, picnic spots, and even some outdoor art installations. It’s a nice escape if you want to stretch your legs and enjoy some greenery without leaving the city.

**Al Barsha Pond Park**  
A smaller park, really calm and relaxing. It has a nice pond in the center, walking paths, and benches where you can sit with a coffee or read a book. It’s perfect if you want a quiet break from the usual touristy spots.

**Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary**  
A total hidden gem. You wouldn’t expect to see flamingos right in Dubai, but this sanctuary is home to hundreds of birds. There are viewing hides and trails, and it’s especially magical during sunrise or sunset when the birds are most active.

Dear Friends, Kind Strangers, and Compassionate Hearts,

I never thought I would have to write something like this. My loving mum — the woman who has always been my strength, my comfort, and my safe place — is now in the fight of her life. About a month ago, our world was turned upside down when she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, an aggressive form of cancer that has spread throughout her body.

This illness has taken so much from her. She can no longer walk without help. She can no longer care for herself the way she once could. Each day is a battle — for breath, for strength, and for even a brief moment without pain. Yet despite everything, she continues to fight with courage, hope, and a quiet determination that inspires me every single day.

But we can’t do this alone. Her treatments, medications, and essential care are almost entirely out-of-pocket, and the costs are far more than we can manage. Without help, she cannot get the treatments she needs to have a fighting chance.

Your support can truly make a difference. Every dollar raised will go directly toward:

• Urgently needed cancer treatments and medications

• Pain management,  physical therapy and home assistance

No matter the amount — whether it’s the cost of a cup of coffee or a month’s rent — every gift matters. Each donation is more than money; it’s a message of love and solidarity that says, “You are not alone in this fight.” If you’ve ever watched someone you love suffer and wished you could take away their pain, you understand the ache in our hearts right now. Today, you have the power to bring light into this darkness. Please take my mum’s hand, walk this road with us, and be part of her fight for life.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your kindness, your prayers, and your generosity. Your compassion means more than words can express, and I pray it returns to you a hundredfold.

With love and gratitude,

1qvjtsi,https://v.redd.it/bptq06il2ghg1,Most budgets fail because they treat savings as what's left over. Here's the counter-intuitive approach that actually works,"You know the pattern: You plan to save money this month. You pay your rent, groceries, bills. Maybe grab coffee a few times. Buy that thing on Amazon. And at the end of the month... there's $47 left. Better than nothing, right?

Except next month, there's $12. The month after? You actually overdrafted.

**This is why traditional budgeting has a 80% failure rate.** When savings comes last, life always finds a way to eat it.

# Enter: Pay Yourself First

The concept is simple but counter-intuitive: **Save money before you spend it, not after.**

When my wife and I were using the 50/30/20 budgeting method (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings), we kept falling short on that 20%. We'd hit 12%, maybe 15%, but rarely the full amount. We knew what we *should* save. We just couldn't make it happen consistently.

Then we discovered Pay Yourself First and flipped the script: The moment income hits our account, 20% goes to savings. *Automatically.* Before we see it. Before we spend it. Before we can talk ourselves out of it.

**It worked.** Suddenly we were consistently hitting our savings targets.

# But then we realized something even more important...

Not all savings are created equal.

Some savings are urgent: emergency fund refills, retirement investments, insurance premiums. Others are important but flexible: vacation funds, celebration money, wish-list items.

We were treating a $2,000 emergency fund gap the same as $2,000 for a beach vacation. That didn't feel right.

**So we created a tiered system:**

**First Priority:** Critical savings (emergency fund, investments, essential sinking funds)  
**Second Priority:** The month itself (bills, groceries, living expenses)  
**Third Priority:** Fun savings (trips, celebrations, wish-list stuff)

The rule: Total savings must hit ≥20% of combined income, but the critical stuff gets funded first, every single time.

**What changed?**

Less stress. Easier planning. And most importantly: *I feel secure.* I know the foundation is solid before we think about the vacation.

# Why this works

PYF works because it removes willpower from the equation. You're not deciding whether to save each month. You're not hoping there's money left over. You're not fighting your impulses.

**You've already paid yourself.** The rest is just managing what remains.

The tiered approach works because it acknowledges reality: Not all financial goals have the same urgency. Your emergency fund matters more than your Christmas budget. Retirement matters more than a new TV.

# How to start

**1. Plan your priority savings first**  
At the beginning of each month, decide what's critical: emergency fund, investments, down payments, sinking funds (insurance, car maintenance, annual expenses). These are non-negotiable.

**2. Pay yourself first when the month begins**  
Transfer those priority savings immediately. First day of the month. Before anything else. These funds are now protected.

**3. Live the month**  
Pay your bills, buy groceries, handle your needs and wants with what remains. This is your 50/30/20 framework in action.

**4. Sweep the surplus into fun savings**  
Whatever's left at month's end? That goes to your flexible goals - personal spending money, vacation fund, Christmas budget, wish-list items.

**The guideline**: Your total savings (priority + fun) should hit at least 20% of your combined income.

That's it. Critical savings are guaranteed. Fun savings grow when you have good months. And you've just reversed your entire financial trajectory. 🚀",1,1770196365.0,monnetta,0,1.0,False
1qvjtmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fit_Wallaby_9624/comments/1qvjtmz/10_herbal_remedies_for_adrenal_fatigue_natural/,10 Herbal Remedies for Adrenal Fatigue (Natural Stress & Energy Support) — what actually helped me stop feeling wiped out,"A couple years ago, I hit that weird phase where I was “technically fine” but constantly exhausted. Sleep didn’t help, coffee barely touched it, and stress felt like it lived permanently in my shoulders. A friend casually said, “Sounds like adrenal fatigue,” and while I know that term is debated, it sent me down a rabbit hole of lifestyle changes and herbs that *actually* made a difference.

That’s why I found myself nodding along while reading about **10 Herbal Remedies for Adrenal Fatigue (Natural Stress & Energy Support)**. Not because it promised a magic fix (it doesn’t), but because it focused on gentle, supportive herbs instead of stimulants that just push you harder when you’re already depleted.

What stood out to me is how many of these herbs are adaptogens—things like ashwagandha, rhodiola, holy basil, and licorice root. The idea isn’t to hype your body up, but to help it respond better to stress over time. When I first learned about **10 Herbal Remedies for Adrenal Fatigue (Natural Stress & Energy Support)**, it reframed how I thought about energy. More caffeine wasn’t the answer; better balance was.

I’ve personally tried a few of these herbs (not all at once), and the biggest change wasn’t sudden energy—it was fewer crashes. Mornings felt steadier, and that wired-but-tired feeling faded. That’s why I appreciate lists like **10 Herbal Remedies for Adrenal Fatigue (Natural Stress & Energy Support)** that explain *why* each herb is used, not just what to take.

Another thing I liked is the emphasis on pairing herbs with basics: sleep, food, boundaries, and stress management. No herb works in isolation, and any realistic discussion of **10 Herbal Remedies for Adrenal Fatigue (Natural Stress & Energy Support)** should acknowledge that. This guide does a solid job of that without sounding preachy.

If you’re curious, this breakdown of [**10 Herbal Remedies for Adrenal Fatigue (Natural Stress & Energy Support)**](https://successformulalab.com/10-herbal-remedies-for-adrenal-fatigue/) goes into each herb in a practical, easy-to-digest way. It’s more “here’s what people traditionally use and why” than “do this and you’ll be fixed.”

I’m really interested in hearing from others though—have you tried adaptogenic herbs for stress or low energy, and did you notice subtle changes over time or nothing at all?

This is my first experience with the Canadian roastery September, and the result was outstanding.

Very juicy and clean in the cup balanced, not overwhelming and not thin either.

The flavor is beautiful: clear peach notes, a juicy aftertaste, and elegant lavender character 😍👌🏻.

And let’s talk about the price 😉

Some roasters sell seasonal Ethiopian coffees for around 18$ with far less quality…

This one delivers both flavor and value.

Excited to try more from this roastery 😍☕️

1. Made a LOT of cringey/unneeded jokes that nobody at the table enjoyed (maybe 15-20 total throughout the visit) - often with the people at the table themselves being the butt of the jokes (e.g. one person ordered two things at once and the server ""jokingly"" corrected them by saying ""Ah ah ah, you skipped a part! Did you want to super-size that first one?"" - or another time one person was on their phone and he came by to ask how the food was and he wagged his finger in her face and said ""You're not even eating the food! You're just texting!"" In both cases the person later said it made them uncomfortable)
2. While I was ordering my food I asked for ""the dressing that has like garlic and basil and stuff in it. I'm not sure what it's called"" and he said ""The basil ranch?"" and I was like ""Yeah that one!"" and he responded by pointing at my menu and saying ""All the dressing options are listed right there"" in a very blunt tone. I responded ""Is it?"" and he said ""Yep. It says 'choice of salad' right there."" then immediately asked the next person to order. The thing is, the dressing options were *not* listed *anywhere* on the menu, and especially not where he pointed, which is why I was unsure of the name to begin with. I had already asked 2 of the other people who were dining with me and they confirmed that it was nowhere to be found on the menu.
3. He didn't bring us the bread that is standard until we explicitly asked for it, at which point he again made a stupid joke: ""Nope! I won't bring it. You asked too nicely."" which made us all uncomfortable again. He then took more than 10 minutes to bring it out. We later had to ask him for a refill (which you aren't supposed to have to ask) and he said he'd bring it right out - he never brought it out for the rest of the meal.
4. Two of the people at my table asked for black coffee with their dessert which is usually free, but when he later brought out the checks he exclaimed ""Oh! I forgot to put your coffees on there."" and took the checks back from the two guests. We all thought he was just making another dumb joke and waited for him to hand the checks back but he actually took them back into the kitchen and came back with a $3 markup on both
5. Right before we left he asked ""Who here feels like being awesome today?"" to the whole table and then essentially held us all captive while he gave us a 45-second lecture about how we can go on their website and leave him a good review

None of these things are necessarily *poor* service (except for the bread), they're mainly just things that my specific group didn't enjoy. He was attentive and good about refilling our waters and he took our orders quickly and all that, just his personality made the whole meal significantly less enjoyable.

I tipped 15%, but I'm wondering what the general concensus on this is. Should I have tipped more or less? I honestly wanted to tip 10% but I felt that would be rude.",3,1770196068.0,etiquette,2,1.0,False

Not complaining really, just... adjusting I guess. Nobody warned me that in your 40s the lifting part is easy. It's everything else that gets complicated. Sleep matters way more than it used to. If I eat like garbage I feel it in my lifts two days later. Work stress shows up in the gym whether I want it to or not. And that shoulder thing from years ago? Yeah that never fully went away, it just becomes part of you.

I've had to completely change how I approach this stuff. More warmup sets than I ever thought I'd need. Actually taking deload weeks instead of skipping them like I always used to. Listening to my body when it says not today instead of grinding through. I run programs I find on Boostcamp but honestly half the skill now is knowing when to back off the prescribed weights.

The ego part was probably the hardest. Accepting that a PR some weeks is just showing up four times. Or adding 2.5lbs to something I've been stuck on forever. Progress looks different now and I'm slowly making peace with that.

* **Flow Profiling:** I designed a custom **Scale** that fits *inside* the drip tray. The machine reads the weight in real-time and adjusts the pump to hit a specific flow rate (e.g., maintain 2.5g/s).
* **Feed-Forward PID:** Standard PIDs react to temp changes. This one predicts them based on the boiler physics, making it much more stable than the stock one.
* **Touchscreen HMI:** I added a HMI device that sits in a custom 3D printed housing next to the coffee machine. I can graph the shot live, change profiles, and adjust settings without opening the machine.
* **WiFi & Home Assistant:** Because if my coffee machine isn’t on my local network, does it even exist?

I’m not selling kits. I’ve published everything—the PCB schematics (KiCad), the 3D print files (STLs), and the firmware code—on GitHub. If you’re handy with a soldering iron and not afraid of voiding your warranty, you can build this.

* **Main Controller:** [https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution](https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution)
* **HMI/Screen:** [https://github.com/andia89/maraxevolution-hmi](https://github.com/andia89/maraxevolution-hmi)
* **Scale:** [https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution-Scale/](https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution-Scale/)

Honestly, I had way too much fun doing this. I want to do it again with a different machine (maybe a Marzocco? another Lelit (Bianca)). I’ve set up a way for the community to vote on which machine I should reverse-engineer next—check the GitHub readme if you want to chip in on that.

Let me know what you think! I’m happy to answer questions about it, please check out my github",8,1770195706.0,Lelit,4,0.91,False

*^(This is my first time attempting a RiShree fanfic. A few HCians nudged me to try my hand at FF, so here I am stepping slightly out of my comfort zone and giving it a shot.)*  
*^(Sharing this with love, a little nervousness, and a lot of sincerity. Gentle feedback is always welcome.)*

  
The Mumbai rain fell in relentless sheets, drumming against the floor-to-ceiling windows of their Bandra apartment. Bhagyashree stood by the balcony door, arms wrapped around herself, watching the city blur into gray. It had been exactly one year since the day Rishabh had stood in front of her, his voice cracking as he put a ring on her finger and said, ""I choose you every single day, Boss Ma'am. Flaws, fears, all of it."" They had gotten married privately with no grand ceremony, just them, their fathers, a simple mangalsutra, and promises whispered like secrets.

Yet some shadows lingered.

She heard the front door click open, then the soft thud of his shoes being kicked off. Rishabh appeared in the hallway, soaked through, and his hair plastered to his forehead, white shirt clinging to his broad shoulders. He carried a paper bag from her favorite South Indian place in Andheri, the one that still made filter coffee the old-fashioned way.

""You're late,"" she said, voice quieter than she intended. Not accusatory but just tired.

""Traffic. And I stopped for extra sambhar. You said last week it was too runny."" He set the bag down, peeled off his wet jacket, and hung it carefully. His eyes searched hers, always did. Its like he was still proving he would never disappear.

Bhagyashree turned back to the rain. ""Naysa's lawyer called the office today. Said she's appealing the last judgment. Something about new evidence.""

Rishabh froze. The name still carried weight, even after everything although Naysa's schemes were exposed, her obsession dismantled in court, her final defeat when the truth about Gautam's framing came out. But some old wounds didn't heal clean.

He stepped closer, not touching yet. ""Shree … I handled it. My team already filed the counter. It's noise. She has nothing left.""

Bhagyashree's laugh was brittle. ""She always finds something. And every time something from the past resurfaces, I wonder if she will""

""If she'll, what?"" His voice sharpened, hurt flashing across his face. ""If she'll make me go back to her and be a man who lied to you? Who used you to hurt your family because I thought you hurt mine?""

She spun around, eyes glistening. ""You almost did ruin me, Rishabh. You came into my life with a plan. I fell in love while you were plotting revenge. And even after you chose me… sometimes I still feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.""

The room went silent except for the rain.

Rishabh closed the distance in two strides, gently cupping her face. His thumbs brushed away the tears she hadn't realized were falling. ""I know. I live with that guilt every day. But Shree, look at me. I burned that plan the moment I realized I couldn't breathe without you. I chose you over revenge, over my anger, over everything. And I'd choose you again. A thousand times.""

She searched his eyes, the same eyes that once hid secrets, now open, raw, pleading. Slowly, she leaned into his touch. ""I want to believe it. I do. But the fear… it creeps in when things get quiet and specially when Naysa that pagal comes back to our life""

""Then let's not let it stay quiet."" He pressed his forehead to hers. ""Come. Eat first. Then talk. Or scream. Or whatever you need.""

They ate cross-legged on the living room rug—idli, chutney, steaming coffee with rain pattering like applause. Rishabh fed her a bite, teasing, ""See? Perfect sambhar. No runny nonsense."" She rolled her eyes but smiled, the tension easing inch by inch.

After dinner, he pulled her to the couch, wrapping them both in a thick blanket. She curled against his chest, listening to his heartbeat steady, familiar.

""Tell me what scares you most,"" he murmured into her hair.

""That you'll wake up one day and remember why you hated me at first. That my past betrayal ,my testimony against your dad, even if it was manipulated will always be between us.""

He tightened his hold. ""I hated what happened to Dad. I hated the system that let Naysa twist everything. But you? You were never the villain, Bhagyashree. You were kind. You believed victims who were paid to lie. You gave your statement thinking it was justice. When I learned the truth… it broke me. But it also freed me to see you clearly. The woman who took a gold loan for my father's treatment when I couldn't even look at you without guilt. The woman who fought for us when I didn't deserve it.""

She lifted her head. ""You fought too. You chose to stay.""

""Because I love you."" Simple. Fierce. ""Not because of revenge or redemption. Just you.""

The words settled over her like warmth after cold. She traced the line of his jaw. ""I love you too. Even when I'm scared.""

He kissed her then slowly, deep, pouring every unspoken apology and promise into it. When they parted, breathless, he whispered, ""Marry me again. TOMORROW. No waiting. Just us, a small pandit, our families if they want. Remind ourselves this is real.""

Bhagyashree laughed softly, surprised. ""We already did that last year,  didn't we?.""

""Then do it every year. Until the fear has nowhere left to hide.""

She nodded, tears mixing with a smile. ""Ummm Okay. But this time, you cook the dinner afterwards. No ordering in.""

""Deal."" He grinned, that boyish, heart-stopping grin that had first cracked her walls. ""I'll even attempt your terrible vada pav recipe. The one where I burn the oil.""

She swatted his arm. ""It wasn't terrible!""

""It was charcoal.""

They dissolved into laughter, the sound chasing away the last shadows.

The next morning it dawned clear. Sunlight spilled across the kitchen as Rishabh, shirt sleeves rolled up, hair still sleep-tousled, stood at the stove attempting idli batter. Bhagyashree leaned against the counter, watching him fumble with the steamer.

""You're doing it wrong,"" she teased, stepping behind him to adjust his hands. Her arms wrapped around his waist from behind. ""Like this.""

He turned in her embrace, pulling her close. ""Or like this."" He kissed her forehead, then her nose, then her lips so soft, lingering.

The pandit arrived that evening. Their apartment was decorated simply with marigolds strung across the balcony, diyas flickering. The family came quietly, Gautam, healed and proud; Padma and Vinayak, finally at peace; Purav and Reevu with their twins and Kartik and Saumya with their daughter laughing in the background.

Rishabh slipped the mangalsutra around her neck again, fingers trembling slightly. ""Bhagyashree I. Kapoor… I promise to protect your heart, not break it. To listen when you're scared. To choose you, always.""

She placed her hand over his. ""Rishabh K. Iyer… I promise to trust you. To forgive the past. To build our future with you. Bade acche lagte hain… tum aur ab hum.""

They exchanged rings under the setting sun, the city lights twinkling below like stars brought closer.

Later, after everyone left, they stood on the balcony. Rishabh wrapped his arms around her from behind, chin on her shoulder.

""No more shadows?"" he asked softly.

She turned in his arms, resting her head on his chest. ""Some days, maybe. But we'll face them together.""

He kissed the top of her head. ""Together.""

The rain had stopped. Only sunlight remained.

**you cannot ""think"" your way out of an anxious nervous system.**

i tried journaling for months. i tried analyzing my childhood. i tried ""no contact.""  
but my body was still shaking. my chest was still tight. i was still addicted.

the turning point happened when i stopped trying to fix my mind and started fixing my body.  
i discovered ""Somatic Release.""  
it sounds fancy, but it’s basically speaking the language of the nervous system. instead of saying ""i shouldn't text her,"" i used specific breathing and tension-release techniques to literally flush the cortisol out of my chest.

**The Result:**  
Week 1: The morning dread (that feeling of waking up wanting to die) dropped by 50%.  
Week 2: I could look at my phone without my heart racing.  
Week 3: The ""Urge"" to check her social media just... vanished. It wasn't a struggle anymore. I just didn't care.

I remember sitting in a coffee shop on Day 30, and realizing i hadn't thought about her for 4 hours.  
I felt safe. I felt whole. I felt like me again.

**The Guide:**  
Because so many of you asked, i compiled the exact routine, the somatic exercises, and the 30-day plan i used into a guide called **""From Anxious to Calm.""**

I’m not a guru. I’m just a guy who escaped the hell of anxious attachment.  
If you are suffering right now, please know: you don't have to live like this.

Only to call, asking me to return it.  

She has a poor memory, I think, 

forgets the birthday of a mutual friend,  

then finds her way to my door,  

pretending she came for comfort.

I've learned not to correct her.  

When she says she forgot where she left it,  

I don't mention how carefully she draped it  

over the back of my chair,  

how her fingers lingered on the fabric  

before she said goodbye.

She forgets many things:  

her umbrella when the forecast is clear,  

her keys on my table,  

her earrings by the windowsill, 

little anchors she leaves behind  

so the tides will bring her back.  

The time, always the time,  

so she has a reason to stay longer.

But she remembers the theatre where we first met,  

the exact shade of my shirt that afternoon,  

the song I hummed while walking her home.  

She remembers how I take my coffee,  

the crack in my voice when I'm tired,  

the way I look at her when I think she isn't watching.

I've stopped asking why she forgets.  

Maybe memory is just another name  

for what we choose to keep,  

and forgetting is just another way of asking  

can I come back?

She's decided I'm worth the forgetting, 

worth the calling, the returning,  

worth every small excuse to stay.  

And I'm always fool enough to say yes…

1qvjhqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qvjhqj/moving_from_manual_grinder_to_electric_single/,moving from manual grinder to electric - single dose or bean hopper? [~$800],"Hello everybody,

After having received my Profitec Go just a few weeks ago, I am now looking to upgrade from my old 1ZPresso JX Pro manual grinder to one an electric one. I am eyeing one of the Profitec grinders, mainly because I have a trusted distributor here in my country which is important to me in case of warranty and after-sales service; besides, it matches my Go aesthetically and is build very solidly.

Where I live, and due to import taxes, the A54 and the SD54 cost basically the same.

I live on my own and usually go through a 200g bag after 6-7 days. I usually drink between 1-3 espresso a day, sometimes one of them gets swapped for a cappuccino. Either way, I never swap beans as I usually start and finish a bag before eventually trying a different roast. If the girlfriend is around and up for a coffee on a weekend, then we use the same beans here again.

So far I've single-dosed with my JX Pro and kept the remaining beans in an Airscape. I am unsure what grinder would best suit my use-case. I could get the A54 hopper version and if I can't really get on with it, replace the hopper with the optional bellow and basically use it as a single dose. The A54 does have a single dose mode.

Any feedback and suggestions are appreciated.",1,1770195139.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

This thing is loud. Ita definitely a ""main character energy"" piece for around the house. The terry cloth feels heavy, and the baroque print on the cuffs/belt is classic Versace.If you want to feel like a high-end villain while making coffee, this is it. It鈥檚 a bit over-the-top, but thats the point.

Score: 7.5/10

2. Acne Studios Stockholm 1996 Windbreaker

I love the boxy, retro silhouette on this. The contrast between the plaid body and the grey sleeves gives it a nice ""dad style"" aesthetic that's very on-trend. The material feels durable but light.Solid layering piece. Very versatile for spring/autumn weather.

Score: 8/10

3. Stussy ""Big Logo"" Knit Sweater 

Hands down my favorite piece in the entire haul. The knit is surprisingly thick, and the way the logo wraps around the side and sleeve is just elite design. It's that perfect oversized fit that doesn't look sloppy.Absolute 10/10. If youre only getting one thing, make it this. Its cozy, iconic, and goes with literally everything.

Score: 10/10

4. Chrome Hearts Long Sleeve (White/Floral) 

Classic CH. The sleeve prints are crisp, and the cotton is soft. However, compared to the other items, it feels a bit ""safe."" Its a staple, but it doesn't have the same ""wow"" factor as the knits.Good for a clean, monochromatic fit. A bit basic, but high quality.

Score: 7/10

5. Hellstar ""Path to Paradise"" Flare Sweats 

These are interesting. The flared bottom is a bold choice, and the vintage-wash/distressing looks authentic. The graphics are heavy-duty screen prints.They are definitely a specific vibe. If you aren't into the flared look, these might feel a bit awkward, but the ""star"" details are cool.

Score: 7/10

6. Hellstar Logo T-Shirt 

A much easier wear than the flares. The faded black/grey wash is perfect for that worn-in vintage look. It has a nice heavyweight feel to it ot a flimsy tee.Great everyday shirt. Low effort, high style.

Score: 8.5/10

7. Balenciaga ""01"" Jersey Long Sleeve 

The sporty/moto-cross aesthetic is hit or miss, but I think the grey tone here works well. The branding is bold but the colors are muted enough to not look like a literal race suit.Very high-fashion ""street"" vibe. A bit boxy in the shoulders, so keep that in mind.

Score: 7.5/10

8. Carhartt WIP Essential Crewneck 

Nothing much to say here Carhartt. The cream color is gorgeous in person. Its the kind of piece you'll still be wearing in five years.The definition of a reliable basic. Quality is top-notch.

Score: 9/10 (for what it is)

9. Cole Buxton ""CB"" Knit 

A really nice, heavy wool-blend feel. The mock neck is tight (in a good way) and the branding is simple. Its a very ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic.Sophisticated and cozy. It's a bit itchy if you have sensitive skin, but the silhouette is perfect.

Score: 8/10

10. Distressed Wide-Leg Painted Jeans 

These have a very ""Balenciaga-adjacent"" aesthetic with the heavy fading and paint splatter. The wide-leg cut is perfect for the current silhouette trends, especially if you're trying to hide the bulk of some chunky boots.Great if you're into the grunge/streetwear look. The paint detail feels intentional rather than messy.

Score: 7.5/10

11. AMI Paris ""Ami de Coeur"" Grey Hoodie

This is a classic ""if you know, you know"" piece. The oversized heart patch on the grey heathered fabric is clean and recognizable without being obnoxious. The hood looks structured, which is a big plus for me.A premium essential. Its the kind of hoodie that makes a simple outfit look expensive.

Score: 8.5/10

12. Chrome Hearts ""Sun-Faded"" Crewneck 

The fading on this is the highlight gives it a genuine vintage, sun-bleached look thathard to replicate. The circular logo patch  on the chest is a nice alternative to the usual sleeve prints.If you want Chrome Hearts but don't want to look like a walking billboard, this is a more tasteful choice.

Score: 8/10

13. Goyard ""Steamer"" Style Backpack/Bag 

The Goyardine pattern is iconic, and this specific structured shape is a bit more unique than the standard totes. It looks like a solid travel or work companion for a ""quiet luxury"" (or not so quiet) vibe.Very high-end. It鈥檚 a statement accessory that elevates everything else you're wearing.

Score: 7/10 (Mostly because it's hard to style casually).

14. Maison Mihara Yasuhiro (MMY) ""Hank"" Lows 

The ""melted"" sole is a love-it-or-hate-it design, but its a  modern streetwear staple. The chunky laces and warped midsole give a standard canvas shoe a complete avant-garde makeover.Super trendy right now. They look great with the wide-leg jeans from earlier in the haul.

Score: 9/10

15. Timberland 6-Inch Premium Boots (Triple Black) 

You can't go wrong with ""Constructs,"" and the all-black colorway makes them much more versatile for darker, monochromatic fits. They look rugged, waterproof, and ready for winter.An absolute tank of a boot. Every wardrobe needs a pair of Timbs.

1qvjew3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntegratedInsights/comments/1qvjew3/budget_2026_explained_what_costs_less_and_what/,Budget 2026 Explained: What Costs Less and What Costs More,"The Union Budget 2026, presented on 1 February, brings a mix of relief and restraint. Some everyday expenses are set to come down, especially in areas like healthcare, education, and clean energy. At the same time, the government has raised costs in certain categories to discourage luxury spending and excessive speculation.

Put simply, Budget 2026 tries to make essentials easier to afford while nudging people to spend more thoughtfully elsewhere.

**Where You Can Save**

* **Critical medicines** \- One of the most important changes is the full exemption of Basic Customs Duty on 17 cancer medicines and 7 drugs used for rare diseases. For families dealing with long term treatment, this can meaningfully reduce financial pressure and improve access to necessary medication.
* **Overseas travel and education spending** \- Taxes on foreign travel and education related remittances have been softened. TCS on overseas tour packages has been brought down to 2 percent, and the same cap now applies to remittances for education and medical treatment abroad. This reduces the upfront cash outflow for individuals and families.
* **Mobile phones and tablets** \- To support domestic manufacturing, customs duties on several key components have been reduced. Over time, this is expected to reflect in the prices of locally assembled smartphones and tablets.
* **Electric vehicles and clean energy products** \- Clean energy continues to receive policy support. Duty relief on EV batteries, lithium ion cells, and solar related inputs is aimed at encouraging adoption and gradually lowering costs.
* **Manufacturing and export inputs** \- Many raw materials and components used by Indian manufacturers can now be imported duty free. This helps businesses manage costs better and stay competitive in global markets.
* **Leather footwear** \- Inputs such as Wet Blue leather can now be imported without customs duty, which may help reduce the prices of high quality leather footwear and accessories.
* **Microwave ovens** \- Certain parts used in the manufacture of microwave ovens have been exempted from customs duty, which could bring down production costs and, eventually, retail prices.
* **Personal imports** \- Customs duty on personal imports has been reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent, making items ordered from abroad for personal use more affordable.

**Where Prices Have Increased**

* **Tobacco and pan masala** \- Prices of tobacco products and pan masala have gone up due to the higher National Calamity Contingent Duty. This aligns with the government’s long standing approach of discouraging consumption through taxation.
* **Imported luxury watches and alcohol** \- Higher customs duties on premium watches, along with increased duties on imported wines and spirits, will make these products more expensive. The intent is to curb excessive luxury imports and encourage domestic value addition.
* **Futures and options trading** \- The Securities Transaction Tax has been increased on both Futures and Options. This raises trading costs for frequent market participants and encourages a more measured, long term approach.
* **High end cameras and filming equipment** \- Importing professional cameras, filming gear, and sound recording equipment will now cost more due to higher duties on select items.
* **Coffee machines** \- The withdrawal of earlier duty exemptions on coffee roasting and brewing machines may push up prices for home and small business coffee equipment.
* **Certain fertilizers** \- Import duty exemptions on inputs such as Ammonium Phosphate have been removed. This is expected to increase costs for certain fertilizers, which could affect agricultural input prices.

**What This Means for You**

For most households, Budget 2026 offers relief where it matters most, especially in healthcare, education-related expenses abroad, and clean energy adoption. At the same time, higher costs on luxury goods and speculative trading signal a clear push toward more responsible spending.

Manufacturers and exporters continue to benefit from duty rationalisation, helping them improve efficiency and remain competitive.

# Conclusion

Budget 2026 takes a balanced route. Essentials become more affordable, long-term growth areas get continued support, and non-essential or speculative activities become more expensive. The overall message is straightforward. Spend wisely, plan for the long term, and focus on what truly adds value.

These platforms are engineered by some of the smartest people on earth to be as addictive as possible. You're not weak. You're up against billion-dollar companies that employ psychologists specifically to keep you scrolling. But once you understand the game, you can beat it.

## Step 1: Understand What You're Actually Addicted To

Social media doesn't give you pleasure, it gives you dopamine hits. Every notification, like, comment, it triggers a tiny reward in your brain. Over time, your brain gets conditioned to crave these hits constantly. This isn't different from how slot machines work.

The book Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke (Stanford psychiatrist and addiction expert) breaks this down perfectly. She explains that we're living in a time of ""dopamine overload"" where our brains are constantly overstimulated. The solution isn't just to quit, it's to reset your dopamine baseline. This book is insanely eye opening. It'll make you question everything about how you consume content and why you feel so restless all the time.

Here's the brutal part: your brain has physically changed because of social media use. The neural pathways for instant gratification are super strong now. Breaking free means rewiring those pathways, which takes time and intentional effort.

## Step 2: Track Your Usage Without Judgment

Before you quit, you need to face the truth. Install a screen time tracker like RescueTime or use your phone's built-in tracker. Don't change anything yet, just observe for a week. How many hours per day are you actually spending? Which apps are the worst offenders?

Most people are shocked when they see the numbers. Five hours a day on Instagram? That's 35 hours a week, basically a full-time job scrolling through other people's highlight reels. You're trading your life for dopamine crumbs.

Write down what you're actually getting from each platform. Be honest. Connection? Nope, you're getting the illusion of connection. Entertainment? Maybe, but at what cost to your mental energy and focus?

## Step 3: Do a 30-Day Dopamine Detox

This concept comes from Dr. Cameron Sepah, a psychiatrist who popularized the idea of dopamine fasting. The goal isn't to eliminate all pleasure, it's to reset your brain's reward system by removing the most addictive stimuli.

For 30 days, delete all social media apps. Not just logged out, fully deleted. This removes the friction of ""just checking real quick."" Your brain will freak out the first few days. You'll feel phantom vibrations, reach for your phone constantly, feel bored out of your mind. Good. That discomfort is your brain recalibrating.

During this time, replace social media with literally anything else. Read physical books, go for walks without headphones, have actual conversations, stare at walls if you need to. Your brain needs to relearn how to be unstimulated.

The Jordan Harbinger Show has an incredible episode with Cal Newport (the guy who wrote Deep Work) about digital minimalism. Newport explains that boredom is actually productive, it's when your brain does its best creative thinking. Social media has stolen your ability to be bored, which means it's stolen your ability to think deeply.

## Step 4: Identify Your Triggers and Build Defenses

After the detox, you'll notice patterns. Maybe you reach for Instagram when you're anxious, TikTok when you're bored, Twitter when you're angry. These are your triggers, and you need alternatives ready.

Trigger: Anxiety
Alternative: Try the app Finch, it's a self-care app that gamifies healthy habits. Instead of scrolling, you take care of a little bird and do mood check-ins. Sounds dumb but it actually redirects that need for quick engagement into something constructive.

Trigger: Boredom
Alternative: Keep a physical book in your bag or by your bed. Make it something you actually want to read, not some self-help book you think you should read. Fiction works great because it satisfies that narrative craving without the toxicity.

If you want something more interactive that keeps you engaged without the brain rot, there's BeFreed. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni that turns books, research papers, and expert content into custom audio episodes. You tell it what you want to work on, like ""break my doomscrolling habit"" or ""build better focus,"" and it creates an adaptive learning plan with podcasts tailored to your pace. You can choose a 10-minute summary or go deep with a 40-minute episode loaded with examples and science-backed strategies. The voice options are addictive too, you can pick everything from calm and soothing to sarcastic or even that smoky, sexy voice like in the movie Her. It's basically designed to replace scrolling with something that actually makes your brain sharper instead of mushier.

Trigger: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
Alternative: Realize that what you're actually missing out on is your own life. The time you spend watching other people live is time you're not spending building your own experiences worth sharing.

## Step 5: Delete Permanently or Use the ""Friction Method""

Here's where people split into two camps: total deletion or strategic friction.

Total Deletion: Delete your accounts entirely. Not deactivate, delete. This is the nuclear option and honestly, it's the most effective. Yes, you'll lose your photos and connections, but ask yourself, what are you really losing? Most of those ""friends"" are acquaintances you wouldn't recognize at a coffee shop.

Friction Method: If you absolutely need to keep certain platforms for work or specific communities, make them as hard to access as possible. Use website blockers like Cold Turkey (this app is brutal, once you set it, you literally cannot bypass it even if you try). Only access social media on desktop, never on your phone. Log out after every use. Remove all apps from your phone. Make it so inconvenient that you only use it when truly necessary.

## Step 6: Replace the Void With Real Connection

Social media tricks you into thinking you're connected, but you're actually more isolated than ever. The research is clear on this. Studies from the University of Pennsylvania found that limiting social media use to 30 minutes per day significantly reduced loneliness and depression.

Start small. Text one friend and make actual plans. Join a local meetup group, take a class, go to the gym at the same time each day and talk to the regulars. Real connection feels awkward at first because your social skills have atrophied, but it gets easier.

The Book Recommendation: Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport (NYU computer science professor, bestselling author). This isn't some anti-tech manifesto, it's a practical philosophy for intentional technology use. Newport interviewed people who successfully quit social media and rebuilt their lives around offline activities. The book gives you a step-by-step plan for a ""digital declutter"" that actually works. This is the best book on this topic, hands down.

## Step 7: Prepare for the Pushback

People will think you're weird for not having social media. They'll say things like ""How do you keep in touch with people?"" or ""How do you know what's going on?"" Prepare your responses now.

""I keep in touch by actually reaching out to people I care about.""
""I get my news from curated sources, not algorithmic feeds designed to enrage me.""

Stand firm. You don't owe anyone access to your attention. Your time and mental energy are the most valuable things you own. Stop giving them away for free to Mark Zuckerberg and whoever runs TikTok now.

## Step 8: Notice the Changes and Protect Them

After a few weeks, you'll notice shifts. Your attention span gets longer. You stop comparing yourself to others constantly. You have more time, like actual hours in your day. Your sleep improves because you're not scrolling before bed. Your anxiety decreases because you're not mainlining outrage and envy.

Document these changes. Write them down. Because there will be moments of weakness where you think ""maybe just Instagram, just to see."" In those moments, read your notes. Remind yourself what you gained by quitting.

The App Recommendation: Insight Timer is a meditation app with thousands of free guided meditations. It sounds cliche but meditation literally strengthens the part of your brain responsible for impulse control. Even five minutes a day makes a difference. And unlike social media, it actually makes you feel better instead of worse.

## Step 9: Build a Life Worth Living Offline

This is the real work. Quitting social media creates space, but you have to fill that space with meaningful stuff. Otherwise, you'll just find another addiction.

What did you used to love before screens took over? Drawing? Playing music? Cooking? Sports? Start there. Join communities around these interests, offline communities. Invest in hobbies that require your hands and full attention.

The goal isn't to become some off-the-grid hermit. It's to use technology intentionally instead of being used by it. Maybe you end up using some platforms again, but on your terms, not because an algorithm decided you should.

## Step 10: Accept That It's Hard and Do It Anyway

Quitting social media is uncomfortable. Your brain will throw tantrums. You'll feel disconnected and out of the loop. Society will make you feel like a weirdo. Do it anyway.

The discomfort of breaking an addiction is temporary. The discomfort of wasting your life scrolling is permanent. Every hour you spend on social media is an hour you're not spending becoming the person you want to be. That's the real cost, and it's way too high.

You've got one life. Stop spending it watching other people pretend to live theirs.

At the start of this year in college, I met this girl at party who I really liked and we had a really great convo and got each other's social media. 

Afterwards, the girl never got into contact and we saw each other around campus often.

A couple of months later, I was at my place and she phoned on social media (she had been drinking) asking me to come over to hers. After coming over to her place, we had a convo and the reason why she didn't get back to me after we meet was because she gets really awkward.

Later that night, we hooked up and I couldn't get it on for her due to stress and other things going on. She eventually gave up and I went home.

The next day in class, we saw and walked past each other and she looked at the ground. Numerous occasions happened in class where she couldn't even make eye contact and she still couldn't.

***Lirevle Redwing***

The first character I created in the gold box redux play, Lirevle was based on my Alura Dawn character from the early 90's, but would be dualled to Cleric rather than Mage instead. She's the secret daughter of one of the Alias clones from Azure Bonds, and looks a little like her mother, being a tall, fit redhead somewhere between Red Sonja and Supergirl Kara in personality - a cheerful, larger-than-life party girl who lives to excess and revels in danger. She's a tall warrior with a mane of red hair framing a slightly masculine face, fit and strong with a dancer's grace.

[The gaudy costume armour is kind of a homage to the Azure Bonds cover and the 80's in general](https://preview.redd.it/m8o73qr2wfhg1.jpg?width=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28e747e471135ee0e25865bdcf6718b352077d87)

Ten yeas after the liberation of Phlan, Lirevle is now 28, a little older and more seasoned and slightly less careless to run in where angels fear to tread. An accomplished warrior who took up the priesthood after an argument with her partner about *Dispelling*, she is a worshipper of Liira, the goddess of the festival, and shares her Chaotic Good alignment. The goddess of revelry has few warrior followers, so she joined the Scarlet Mummers faction, those Lliirans who actively hunt down and slaughter those who would harm their more peaceful members. A firm believer in 'pay evil to those who do it', Lirevle rather scares a lot of her fellow worshippers who lack her ruthlessness and thirst for spilling blood.

Comfortable in all kinds of armour – or none at all – her preferred outfit is the gaudy suit of mail and plate (the equivalent of *Banded Mail +5*) lacquered in the colours of her goddess. Although she is skilled at many weapons, including the composite longbow, her favourite ever blade was the *Flame Tongue +2* longsword she found in a well in Valjevo Castle, and she laments its loss to this day. Her time spent training as a priestess gave her a new appreciation for blunt weapons however, and her current favourite is a *Flail +4* as she enjoys its impact on her luckless foes as it splatters her with their blood. Now Hayley knows the new *Flame Touch* spell, she can even have it coated in flames in battle!

Now an accomplished divine caster, she retains a great fondness for *Flame Strike*, especially against spellcasters who start casting. She doesn't use reversed spells much, focusing on healing and buffing.

She still misses her 'fathers' – the elf Elathaen and the dwarf Thoradin, now retired to run a cosy tavern in the Dales. She has no memory of her parents, although Elathaen did tell her that her mother was an Alias clone named Jade, who died around the same time as Xiao's family. She grew up with Xiao as her adopted sister, although that changed in their late teens after they ended up in a hayloft during a wild festival celebration. They have been a couple ever since, and are faithful to each other, although they bicker like an old married couple, that being the nature of Chaotic types. Together they spent a year doing the 'Fairy Light Nights' tour of festivals, many of which were held near sylvan glens and other places sacred to Lliira. Lirevle is now more careworn than in her youth, but mostly remains cheerful, enjoying the party lifestyle of hard liquor, sweet smoke-weed and the arms of her lover most of all.

In terms of personality, she is outspoken, overconfident, brash and volatile – but also kindly and good-natured, quick to trust with a ready smile. Hurt innocents however, and she's quick to show her ruthless and bloody side, something every few ever survive.

***Xiao Shang***

https://preview.redd.it/55nx68kdwfhg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf30abbc038cfb6ff0e84e10c0e9f0bcb45c0285

Like her lover, Xiao barely recalls her parents, though her father adventured with her foster-fathers and died around the same time Jade did. Thoradin said he was a monk from Kara-Tur, but reading between the lines, she feels he was more likely an adventuring thief. She keeps a few Shou traditions, but mostly dresses and speaks like any Moonsea native and lacks any accent. Back home, her name would have been *Shang Xiao*, that is Xiao of the family Shang, but now she uses her given name first in the western tradition.

Xiao is a smallish, slight woman whose delicate appearance belies a steely toughness. She is now thirty, but Shou women look the same between seventeen and seventy anyway. She thinks of herself as the unappreciated, long-suffering big-sister to the others, the 'designated driver' for all the Swanways. She knows most occidentals expect a Shou woman to be demure and submissive, so she plays up to that sometimes, although she's almost as committed to the party life as her lover and shares her Chaotic Good alignment.

As a priestess of Mystra, she has lately started learning arcane magic, and is fascinated by spells and artefacts of all kinds and the magical traditions of others. She is compassionate and caring (if mercurial and unpredictable) and tends to the emotional well-being of her party as well as their physical hurts. As a cleric, she is used to armour and weapons, although she's never taken fighting as seriously as Lirevle does.

Lately, she's become a little clingy and needy, which festers into being envious and jealous, and feelings of insecurity. Privately, she feels a little taken for granted, and finds herself always struggling to keep up - a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. Lirevle and Kalara now outstrip her as clerics, and she's nowhere near as accomplished a mage as Haleh or Rizarli. She wouldn't even begin to know what to do with herself outside of the Swanmays however, so bears it all with her usual good humour. She finds herself wondering if having an affair would liven herself up, but she's too loyal to stray, contenting herself with idle fantasies about nearly every woman she meets on her adventures.

***Haleh Cashal***

https://preview.redd.it/b6wzusqkwfhg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bc76df0f0a27e36f5baf7b93f40104bc52052b4

Born to a common thief and a prostitute in Calimport, Haleh ran away from home in her early teens, heading for the Moonsea. She spent a year with Princess Fatima's nomad tribe serving as a scout, but despite enjoying her time with them, found she preferred the cities to the wilds and headed for Phlan to make her fortune. She was caught by Elaethan trying to steal his spell-book – the elf complimented her daring and offered to give her some pointers. He took her under his wing (along with his lover, the dwarf Thoradin, both accomplished adventuring thieves) and she learned much from them. They already had two adopted daughters around her age, and she essentially became a third. She had already seen something of the world however, and while she was always extremely grateful to her new companions, she felt a little like a third wheel, especially compared to their favourite, Lirevle, with whom she developed both an awkward friendship and a competitive rivalry.

After the liberation of Phlan, she felt ready for a change, and following the Azure Bonds incident, she felt glad they were striking out on their own. Elathaen had begun teaching her magic too – unlike the elves, she had to stop practising thievery to fully commit to sorcery. She found herself revelling in the sheer power of it, the delicious rush of reducing her foes to smoking ashes with fire and lightning.

Before she left, Elaethan bequeathed her his *Silver Sword +5;* the last tie to his former role as Prince of Ilefarn, gifted by his father, elven-king Elorfindel. She initially refused the honour, saying that it surely had to go to Lirevle. But he convinced her to take it, admitting that she needed it more than Lirevle ever would – she was a natural warrior, while Haleh needed every edge she could get. Despite that being a back-handed compliment, she saw the sense in it, and they parted on good terms.

As a young thief, Haleh was tomboyish and scruffy, keeping her hair short. All that changed as a sorceress – she grew her hair out (and eventually wore it in a Turmish style with beaded braids after meeting Sabri). She dressed stylishly, accentuating her beauty with kohl cosmetics. perfume and oils, preferring slinky black dresses and gowns that showed off her supple body and coffee-coloured skin. She likes showy jewellery and gaudy decorations, as if daring thieves to try their luck in taking it.

Haleh's *Bracers of Defence* give her great freedom of movement (and clothing), allowing her to manoeuvre in battle to set up *Lightning Bolts* and *Cones of Cold.* She prefers to stay out of melee, unless she can try for a backstab - one of which put an end to the Dreadlord himself in the Great Glacier. These days she rarely runs out of magic, but while learning her sorcery, she supplemented her spells by sniping with the small-bow Elaethan taught her. She misses the *Sling of Seeking +2* given to her when she left the nomads. She also misses her *Efreeti Bottle,* and hopes whatever is left of Tyranthraxus is suffering in some foul afterlife for taking her stuff away.

Haleh is somewhat defensive, cynical and sarcastic compared to the others and is the only Swanmay not of Good alignment. Truly Neutral, She thinks of herself as a realist and a pragmatist, a much-needed voice of reason and the art of the possible. The others sometimes find her lacking in empathy and compassion; she learned early on that the only person she can ever *really* rely upon is herself. Despite liking the others, she still sees them as friends rather than family, and wonders if one day she will move on – or if she's stuck with them forever.

Her name is pronounced in the Calishite tradition as 'Hally', although the others insist on calling her 'Hayley', much to her annoyance. Even more annoyingly, when she was starting out, and hesitant with her magic, they'd call her 'Today Hayley' when they couldn't hear the reassuring rush of her fireballs detonating: *“Today, Hayley, that would be great... Any time now, in fact, right now would be fantastic, thanks!”*

A quiet, private, acerbic woman, she looks younger than her thirty years, although small care-lines have started to form around the corners of her eyes. Not even her friends know her romantic inclinations, although they are always trying to pair her up with Sabri so they can be a third couple. She's beginning to wonder if she's lonely and desperate enough to agree to that. More than once, she's felt like she'd enjoy some really good hate-sex with Lirevle, with whom she's always had a spiky rivalry. She's also irritated by how Rizarli masters magics so easily – today, they have the same level of power, despite Haleh having practised it far longer than the Rashemi.

Haleh is a surprisingly good singer and dancer, and deep down wishes she had become a Bard. But she feels self-conscious when performing and is easily embarrassed, so when they drag her to festivals she spends all her time drinking and smoking instead.

Many expats come from extremely privileged backgrounds, yet they still claim Hong Kong as their own.

How much do they really know about ordinary Hong Kongers’ struggles? Do they shop at local shopping centres? Do they eat at 大家樂 or at 大牌檔? Are they genuinely curious about the everyday local culture and customs of Hong Kong? Do they put in the effort to learn Cantonese? Do they try to befriend locals outside their own western English speaking bubble?

I come from an ordinary Hong Kong family, and we have all experienced hardship in the past. It is deeply upsetting to see so many outsiders waltz in and claim Hong Kong as their own while making little to no effort to understand the lived experience of the majority. Instead, they flaunt their privilege. Yet if we were to go to the UK, our culture would likely be frowned upon. I feel they cannot claim to be Hong Konger unless they put effort in understanding our culture when we our families worked hard to carve a space here for decades and they just walk around with their privilege getting the best out of our city. Meanwhile, us ordinary hong Kongers live a live of misery and get exploited by these outsiders that never stood with us when it mattered like in 2019. All they do is live eat shop at the same yoga studio, fancy coffee, French dinners, and speak English all day and expect us to speak English back to them when English isn’t our mother tongue.",0,1770194228.0,HongKong,26,0.32,False

I'm essentially posting here cuz my social circle is basically a dumpster fire on wheels: one (1) flesh-bag human I used to spam daily (r.i.p.), a shady rotating council of large language models that yap about Schrödinger’s fanfiction and isomorphisms at midnight, plus whatever eldritch demon inside possesses the ""send"" button at 3am...likely, Azathoth, my sphincter bro turning my thumbs into fleshy upvote sticks. 👍📱 Oh, I must add I am schizophrenic w/ very mild autism, which means I have developer tools open in this psyche.

Interests / what I'll happily ramble about till the sun explodes:

■ Symbolism / myth / anthropology ( pattern-spotting like hacking the human OS's ancient glitchy UI, spotting archetypes in your morning coffee stains)

□ Philosophy (mustache-twirling, Jung shadow-dancing, epistemology rabbit holes like ""what even counts as real, bro?"", why humans invent meaning like it's a zombie apocalypse survival guide)

● Tech + AI (I'll talk about this in any sort of domain of your choosing, you are allowed to get as technical as possible and I'll still understand and expand 🤖)

○ Systems thinking (watching people, cultures, and institutions self-destruct with flair)

♡ Music (I am a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter, I can tawk all day about it. I have recorded over 200 songs, so I can thoroughly discuss writing processes)

♧ Absurdist humor (Deadpool energy: irreverent AF, self-aware like a mirror that's judging you back, but not just edgy for the sake of poking bears with sticks—like...I'm not gonna call you or your Grandma fat, but I'll think she is and you too) 🃏

1qvj7si,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qvj7si/how_to_hack_your_hormones_the_science_nobody/,How to Hack Your Hormones: The SCIENCE Nobody Talks About,"I spent months diving into research papers, podcasts, and books about hormones because I kept wondering why some weeks I'd be insanely productive and other weeks I couldn't drag myself out of bed. Turns out, most of us are walking around completely clueless about the chemical messengers running our lives. Your hormones control literally everything: your mood, your weight, your sleep, your sex drive, your energy levels. And the wild part? Most of the advice we get about health completely ignores this.

The thing is, our modern lifestyle is basically designed to wreck our hormonal balance. We're constantly stressed, we eat at random times, we stare at screens until 2am, we don't move enough during the day but then try to compensate with brutal workouts. It's like trying to run high performance software on damaged hardware. But here's what I learned from endocrinologists, neuroscientists, and actual research: once you understand how this system works, you can work with it instead of against it.

**Cortisol is probably ruining your life and you don't even know it.** This stress hormone is supposed to spike in the morning to wake you up and drop at night so you can sleep. But most people have it completely backwards. We hit snooze five times, chug coffee on an empty stomach, check our phones immediately, and wonder why we feel anxious all day. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. The fix is annoyingly simple: get bright light in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking up, ideally sunlight for 10 minutes. No sunglasses. This literally resets your circadian rhythm and starts the cortisol curve properly. At night, dim the lights after 8pm and use blue light blockers if you must use screens. I know it sounds too basic to work but the research on circadian biology is insanely solid.

**Your insulin sensitivity changes throughout the day.** Most people don't realize that eating carbs late at night is metabolically different than eating them in the morning. Your body is way better at processing glucose earlier in the day. The book [""The Circadian Code"" by Dr. Satchin Panda](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37534452-the-circadian-code) breaks this down with actual studies. He's a circadian biology researcher at the Salk Institute and his work on time restricted eating is fascinating. Basically, if you eat all your meals within a 10 to 12 hour window and stop eating 3 hours before bed, your insulin sensitivity improves dramatically. Your body gets better at burning fat, your sleep quality goes up, and inflammation drops. I started doing this six months ago and the difference in my energy levels is honestly ridiculous.

The app Zero is super helpful for tracking your eating windows. It's got different fasting protocols built in and sends you reminders. Way better than trying to remember when you last ate. The interface is clean and it's got tons of educational content about the science behind it.

**Leptin and ghrelin are why you can't stop thinking about food.** Leptin tells your brain you're full, ghrelin tells you you're hungry. When you don't sleep enough, leptin drops and ghrelin spikes. This is literally why you crave junk food after a bad night of sleep. It's not willpower, it's hormones. The research on this is pretty clear: people who sleep less than 6 hours consistently have way higher obesity rates. Your body thinks you're in some kind of emergency situation and tries to make you store fat. [Dr. Matthew Walker's book ""Why We Sleep""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) has an entire section on metabolic hormones and it's genuinely terrifying. He's a sleep scientist at UC Berkeley and this book will make you question everything you think you know about sleep. Best book on sleep I've ever read, hands down.

Protect your sleep like your life depends on it because metabolically it kind of does. Keep your room cold, like 65 to 68 degrees. Use blackout curtains. If you live in a noisy area, get a white noise machine or use the app Insight Timer which has tons of sleep sounds and guided sleep meditations. The free version is solid.

**Strength training is the most underrated hormone hack.** When you lift weights, you increase testosterone and growth hormone naturally in both men and women. This helps you build muscle which then increases your metabolic rate and improves insulin sensitivity. It's like a positive feedback loop. Cardio is fine but it doesn't have the same hormonal benefits long term. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon talks about this a lot. She's a functional medicine physician who specializes in muscle centric medicine. Her approach is that muscle is basically the organ of longevity. More muscle equals better glucose disposal, better hormone production, better aging.

You don't need to become a bodybuilder. Three times a week, 45 minutes, compound movements like squats, deadlifts, presses. That's enough to see significant hormonal changes.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI learning app that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books on topics like metabolic health and hormone optimization to create personalized audio episodes and adaptive learning plans. It's built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers. What makes it useful is the flexibility, you can get a quick 10 minute overview or switch to a 40 minute deep dive with more context and examples depending on your schedule. The voice options are addictive too, there's a smoky Samantha style one that's weirdly engaging for commutes. Since it adapts based on what you highlight and how you interact with the virtual coach, the content actually evolves with your specific goals. Covers all the books and research mentioned here plus way more.

**Magnesium deficiency is everywhere and it tanks your sleep and stress response.** Most people are deficient because our soil is depleted and we don't eat enough leafy greens. Magnesium glycinate before bed helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system and improves deep sleep. It's also a cofactor for like 300 enzymatic reactions in your body including ones that produce serotonin and melatonin. I take 400mg before bed and it's made a noticeable difference in how fast I fall asleep and how rested I feel in the morning.

The thing nobody tells you is that all these systems are connected. Better sleep improves insulin sensitivity which helps you lose fat which improves hormone production which gives you more energy which helps you sleep better. It's all one system. You can't hack one part and expect everything else to fall into place, but once you start aligning a few of these things, the momentum builds fast. Your body actually wants to be in balance, you just have to stop fighting against its natural rhythms.",2,1770194104.0,MomentumOne,1,1.0,False
