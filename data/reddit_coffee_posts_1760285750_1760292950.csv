Café Desolation Disclaimer

 Disclaimer:

Everything you hear in Café Desolation is fiction. The monsters are metaphors, the demons are just bad habits, and the miracles are exaggerations brewed alongside the coffee.

Nobody here has actually seen a gorgon, a skinwalker, or the so called Desert Son. Those are just stories people tell when the caffeine hits too hard and the desert heat starts to bend the air.

Any resemblance to real people, places, or events is purely coincidental, accidental, or the result of long nights and too much espresso.

Believe what you want, but remember: this is a story.

Management, Café Desolation

*****

The ex skinhead kid from the other night left my keys on the café table. I fold my body up, take them, and move for the door like I have been practicing the exit my whole life.

The café hums with the low throb of dying neon. Dust floats through the sunlight cutting across the cracked tile floor. The smell is half coffee, half burnt sage. Every time I come here it feels like a confessional booth that never learned how to forgive.

I nod at the gorgon behind the counter and slap a greasy twenty down, hard enough to sound like a declaration. His polite gaze never meets mine. He takes the bill and lifts it like a toast, the serpents on his head hissing quietly as if offering their own benediction.

He does not say it out loud, but I know what he is thinking. Do not come back until you have cleaned your aura, sinner.

The skinwalker in the corner lifts its head. The patchwork of stolen flesh around its eyes shifts like wind through paper. I lean close enough to make the words a blade, “Your sins can be forgiven. All of them.”

The creature’s fingers close around my hand, cold as desert shade. It does not speak, but the wave that hits me is raw and heavy, a pulse of gratitude, shame, and hunger. Nobody has ever told it forgiveness was on the table before. I give its hand a squeeze before pulling free.

The bell over the door chimes as I step out, and the sunlight hits me in the teeth. It tastes like rust and gasoline. The parking lot shimmers like a mirage that is tired of pretending to be water.

Closer now. The Desert Son is out there somewhere, borrowing my old name, scrubbing it clean enough for the desperate to drink from. Working with kids who tattoo hate like it is a sacrament. Spreading inspiration the way a plague spreads, slow, quiet, unstoppable.

My car coughs when I turn the key, like it is remembering all the sins it has carried. The engine sputters, wheezes, then gives up a grudging growl. I pat the dashboard.

“Soon, you can rest, my shitmobile,” I tell it, and for once I mean it.

The freeway stretches ahead like a scar through the desert. Billboards rot under the sun, old promises peeling into nothing. The heat turns the road into a living thing that breathes and wavers.

Halfway to Victorville, the thought to call Tommy crawls into my skull, hungry, noisy, desperate. I push it down. No use getting him wound up without a destination first. We have been chasing ghosts and whispers for too long. He needs focus, not fire.

The radio is busted, so it is just me, the hum of the road, and the whisper of something ancient that still remembers my name. The Desert Son thinks he can wear it better. Thinks he can play prophet with borrowed bones.

I am rattling cages. Time to drag this party to Mr Snake’s new empire, catch him with his pants down, and kick his neo Nazi raising ass until he remembers why snakes stay underground.

The car lurches forward, heading east into the glare.
The sun bleeds across the windshield, and for a moment I swear I see shapes in the light, scales, wings, something burning just beneath the horizon.

Then it is gone.
And it is just me again, chasing ghosts down the 15.

I met someone at work, we worked together for a year then grew close to each other, as the work place was toxic, and going through financial issues. We were all we had and we supported each other through it, I guess you could say we trauma bonded.

One day, 2-3 months into the relationship we go out on a coffee date and we start talking about our future. She was insistent on getting married fast, I wanted marriage too but the situation at work was just too unstable (by unstable I’m talking the company started running out of cash because our boss was a dumb knucklehead and we were actually going months unpaid). I kept stressing that I want her, I want the future together, I just needed time to get myself out of the mess onto something stable so I am anchored in myself.

At first she was patient but then she started being cold and pulling away and I could feel it. It got worse and worse over time, all the while I was trying to keep our relationship together, keep the office together (so many people quit) and look for another job. She got an offer for another job and broke up with me a few months later. 

Someway somehow I go stuck in that job for a couple more months before I got an offer an moved out. I took the first offer I got with less pay but more stability. We were casually texting each other and just checking in each other during this time, and I never stopped wanting her. 

Five months into my new job, we were texting and she told me that there is a position vacant at her company (an international office, better than where I was) and that she recommended me. I got an interview and got the job. A couple of months into getting the job and getting through the probation period I proposed.

She said she would think about it, and it’s been a month now and she hasn’t gotten back to me at all. I gave her space because I asked a week in and she said she wanted time to think. All this time we were doing well at work and communicating well. She would flirt and I would flirt back and all the signs indicated that this could be it. I just learnt today through a mutual friend that she didn’t want marry me anymore. 

I feel so heartbroken because I during the last year and a half I worked my ass off to never be in a situation like I was financially. I built myself up, I anchored myself in so I could provide for her and love her. I felt so betrayed and hurt. She didn’t talk to me all this time, I’ll open up the conversation this week and end it for good.

The thing is we would still be in the same office. All the advice I read about blocking her out of all social media and cutting all contact is fine but I would still be seeing her everyday.

Any advice on how I can move on in a situation like this?

However the immense conspitation, nausea and gas from Day 1 was bad. I couldn’t eat anything (but I was hungry).   

Day 2 my stomach felt iffy after I had a coffee so I decided to use the washroom. Didn’t know I was going to be BARFING my whole coffee and breakfast (banana). Unexpected. Also I cannot eat hard foods. 

Day 3 I did my last barf and now I’m having massive diahrea. No matter what I eat or drink I will have diahrea. Day 3 I can slowly eat more hard food like chicken and beef but I can’t finish my meal due to nausea. 

Day 4 (today) I drank a glass of water for breakfast and immediately pooped it out. It was all water.

Try #2","I’m a 38-year-old from the East Coast of the U.S. looking to find someone who enjoys a thoughtful, consistent email exchange - the kind that makes checking your inbox feel a little more meaningful than just deleting newsletters and shipping updates.  I posted last week and had some responses but most have fizzled out and now i'm back seeking that elusive unicorn penpal. 

A little about me:  
I’m introverted, work remotely from home, and like conversations that go a bit beyond “how’s your day.” Some of my hobbies include basketball (watching and playing), card collecting (sports and some nostalgic stuff), photography (mainly street and travel), hiking, and traveling when I get the chance.

I’m also into movies - especially romantic comedies - though my favorite might not technically qualify: the *Before Trilogy* (*Before Sunrise*, *Before Sunset*, *Before Midnight*). There’s just something about the slow burn of dialogue and character growth that really sticks with me.

I enjoy giving advice, playful debates, and a little friendly back-and-forth. I’m definitely looking for someone who doesn’t mind a bit of banter and can hold a good conversation without needing to be prodded with questions every time.

**What I’m hoping for:**  
I’d really like to connect with someone who enjoys writing **medium to long emails**, who’s okay with sharing small moments of everyday life, and is up for exchanging the occasional “this is what my day looked like” photo (nothing fancy - think coffee mugs, a walk outside, a new book, or an unreasonably messy desk). Bonus points if you like to write every couple of days and don’t let the conversation fade for a week at a time.

I'm not looking for anything romantic - just a steady, friendly exchange with someone who’s thoughtful, curious, and maybe even a little competitive in a fun way (whether that’s who takes the better photo or who makes the better random observation about life).

If this sounds like a good fit, feel free to send me a message with a bit about yourself and your interests. Happy to start slow and see where the conversation goes. No pressure, just good vibes and a more interesting inbox.

Just signed the divorce papers yesterday, so no worries. Also happened to be the one year anniversary of the day we moved into this house I just had built for her. 

I (M42) have been married to my wife (F36) for 13 years. We dated for 2 years. Separated once 8 years ago for about 5 months. We have 3 children together, ages 2 1/2, 11, and 13. I loved her like crazy. I was obsessed with my wife. I couldn't wait to come home to her. I bought her anything she wanted even if we didn't really have the money. Even if I had to sell my things to get it. I told her I loved her every day. I told her she was gorgeous every day. I supported her for all the time we were together. 

About 2 months ago, she returned from a trip to visit family out of state that cost me $4K. I tried to convince her it wasn't a great idea, but she lashed out at me and called me names. She was there 2 weeks. I missed her hard and she appeared to miss me as well. Sending nudes, having phone sex, telling me she couldnt wait to get home. I finished all my honey do lists and the house was spotless and I even worked a ton of overtime because no one was home so the paychecks were chunky. 

The night I picked her up from the airport I could sense something was a tad off. She was frustrated with me very quickly. It was a far cry from the energy we shared on the phone. We did have sex that night so i just chalked it up to it being a rough trip. She said she didn't have much fun and being on a plane with 3 kids is stressful. 

We were in marriage therapy at a wonderful place and had gone to maybe 15 sessions before the trip. It was mostly for a mild porn addiction I have and her spending problems and routine maintenance. She came to one session after the trip and then she just quit. She decided she didn't want to go anymore. She made excuses. She was tired. Work changed her schedule. She didn't feel well. I went to the last 3 sessions by myself. The therapist had to end it because it was unethical to see me and talk about her. I get it. But in the very last session she said something that was very unnerving. My mom is a narcissist and she and my wife hate each other. But they're very similar. She asked me if I was afraid that my wife could possibly be a narcissist. I thought no way. I didn't bring it up to her. 

Over the course of the next 2 weeks I witnessed alarming changes and glowing red flags. I work a hard job and its 2nd shift, so I come home kinda late. Around 10pm. I came home one night and found her in the bathtub shaving her bush. I was immediately like, ""Who is THAT for? I didn't ask you to do that."" I like the bush. She claimed she just wanted to groom to feel cleaner and prettier. She had also gotten on Ozempic about a month before the trip so I was noticing an obvious weight loss. She was around 185 before and around 160 when she got back. Then she started using workout equipment in the garage. And doing it naked. When I'd go in there to say something she'd get an attitude with me and tell me to leave her be. I started noticing the Victoria's Secret and Sephora bags. Constantly. I never got to see her in any of these items, but it was hundreds of dollars per visit. Close to $1k per week in spending on lingerie and makeup.

More weight started to fall off and our bedroom was all but dead and that's when I confronted her. She called me crazy. Assured me nothing was going on. It's also important to note she started her first job about 9 months ago waitressing at a popular brunch spot for extra cash and the schedule was great for the kids school schedule. She started getting very involved with her coworkers. All of them very attractive, but much younger girls. 12-15 years younger and all single and wild. Always hanging out with them. Spa days. Activities. Mimosas on her days off. She said she was starting to feel alive and feel like a real person. I was happy for her. It got excessive quickly. Even when our household got sick. We were sick for about 4 weeks straight. It didn't stop her at all. Started drinking regularly. Using different words and dressing differently. It was a drastic and sudden change that jarred me. 

Then she started talking about getting a tattoo. That was about 5 weeks ago. She showed me a guy that's pretty well known locally that she happened to have grown uo with. A sloppy looking fellow, but his work was good and she said he was a good dude. She was very promiscuous before we met and after all the red flags I had been seeing, I had to ask. ""Did you ever sleep with him?"" Man, she exploded. It was like I accused her of murder. She assured me that I was insane for asking such a thing. He was very unattractive. I believed her. Moved past it. She started talking to him more and seeing him to work on ideas for this massive double sleeve neck piece. She says her mom is paying for it. Her mom pays for a lot so that wasnt alarming. 

She was upset about her mom being sick and one night begged me if she could go hang out with this coworker she liked. She said they were gonna grab a few drinks and talk and I let her. I thought nothing of it. This event will come back into play later. 

Like I mentioned before, we were sick. Strep throat. One night I can hear her coughing upstairs. I guess I should also mention she started sleeping in another bedroom upstairs because the 2 year old sleeps with us and because she has to be up early she says he makes it hard for her to sleep. Again, that leads to our bedroom being completely dead. And when I'd go up to check on her she'd be awake on her phone. She'd get furious at me for checking on her and she'd say I was treating her like a child. I'd say I was upset that she was sleeping elsewhere and I missed her and she would call me selfish. So, one night shes coughing bad and I'm concerned so I go check on her. I tell her she needs to go to the doctor and get on antibiotics because we have strep and over thr counter meds aren't gonna cut it. She says she's going to work and she'll go to the doctor if she still feels bad. 

So the next day I get up and take kids to school and head to work. Again, I should note that I pass her restaurant on my way to work. Its so easy to see if her truck is there. This day it's not. I swing in to grab my lunch at the restaurant next door and I see her manager standing outside. I asked him if she went to the doctor and he said she wasn't scheduled today. My heart sinks and my stomach turns. I started calling and texting to no avail. I check the parking lot at her doctors office and both emergency rooms nearby and she's not there. I finally hear back from her about 2 hours into my shift. She claims to have gone to see her mom and sister. I asked if she went to the doctor and she said yes. I said you weren't at the places I checked. She said, oh I was at the small ER closer to our house. Our older kids were so sick they stayed home from school. I said so, you passed our gouse where our sick kids are waiting on you to visit your mom and sister? She's like yeah. It's not weird. Dont act like it's weird. Alarms are going off. Her mom is also very sick. She was just diagnosed with lung cancer. So I let it slide. 

We were watching a scary movie one night in the living room. That felt nice. It was very good and when the movie ended I tried to cuddle with her and she pushed me away and said we just watched a scary movie and I'm very overstimulated. But she didn't say it nicely and her face said much more. Then she casually asked me to get her something from the pantry. I got up to go get it, opened the pantry door, and just started bawling. Sobbing uncontrollably. She whipped her head around and started screaming at me. ""Whats wrong? What's wrong with you? What is happening?"" I told her I didn't know, but I know now. I could feel the disconnect. I could feel her slipping away. 

My birthday passes and I'm very sick and still had to work. I never got a gift from her. Never even the words happy birthday. When I got home from work that night she said to me, ""Why does your birthday always suck?"" Maybe because you dont give a shit to make it decent? I dunno. I get a bonus around her birthday every year and its always extravagant. She does nothing for me. Never even cooked me a meal. Never even worn a piece of lingerie for me. 

Then things start to get real weird. Always on her phone. Never looking at me. Never sitting on the same piece of furniture I'm on. Always smiling at her phone. I cant get her attention for anything. She won't look at me. She won't speak to me. Bedroom dead, but she looks amazing and is always naked. New Victoria's Secret bags everywhere. She even had me take her to the big one in the mall and let me help her pick out some stuff. It's almost $500, but I don't even care. Nothing happens that night. I don't get to see her in any of it. She did give me the most random oral ever about 2 nights later. I figure its just a rough patch because we were all sick and her trip was bad and the money kind of hurt us. Maybe things will go back to normal. 

Then the freeze out continues. But it's even worse. It doesn't last long. Tattoo day comes. It's Friday September 26th. My sister's birthday. But she's isolated me from my family so I have no plans with her.  I work all day and I don't hear from her once. I get home and she's not home. I ask my older kids where she is and they have no idea. I know in my gut something is going on and I call her absolutely livid. She picks up and I said ""Where the fuck are you?"" She literally responded, ""I'm done. I'm just done. I've checked out and I'm finished with you."" She hangs up, gets home about 20 minutes later. She claims to have been at this coworker girls apartment. She still has the saran wrap around her new tattoo. I don't care to see it. I try asking what happened? Can we work on this? We were in therapy, let's go back. She said that place sucked and I hated that bitch. All she did was give you excuses for your abuse and excuses for your porn when you're just a pervert and you don't love me. I leaned into it. I told her she was right. I'm horrible. I'll fix myself. Ive ruined everything. Please let's work this out. She was cold. Unfeeling. Checked out. 

The next day I'm determined to do something about this. I'm bawling. Sobbing uncontrollably. Didn't sleep much. Not hungry at all. I call her mom. We start talking and I asked about the day she came to see her. She says she hasn't seen her in months. Boom. I knew it. My spidey sense was right. I confronted her when she got home from work. She says there's another man and she loves him. She says intimacy with him is transcendent and she has never felt this way about another person. 

Our kids are crying. My 13 yo son is threatening to kill himself. My 11 yo daughter told her to get her cheating ass away from her dad. She admitted this right in front of them. They stay in my room crying with me while we try to figure out what's going on and what we can do. She walks in naked after showering upstairs like nothing is wrong. She's down to 115lbs now. Nipples hard. Fresh tan. Tiny little landing strip. New tats. New nose piercings. Just all out in front of the kids. She gets ready in some very skimpy and completely see through nighty. With thick heels on and leaves. She went to see him looking like that. She even turned and smiled at me on her way out the door. She did this again Sunday night as well. 

Monday I call my company lawyer and have him start getting divorce papers ready, but I'm nowhere near done. She's claiming this is a guy she met while working at the restaurant. She says he had been coming in for a while and was very persistent and one day she caved and fell for him immediately. There has been so much lying that I don't buy it. There are days of me researching. Begging her and pleading with her to stay. Think of the kids. I just built you this house. You have health insurance with me. Youre safe with me. I tried everything. She's desd set. She's in love. She goes out with him every night. She won't stay in the house at all anymore. So I'm parenting all 3 kids and working the bread winning job. All while being emotionally destroyed, sleep-deprived, and starved. Constantly breaking down and sobbing. Even at work. I got sent home twice that first week and even fainted for the first time in my life. I am eviscerated. My kids are devasted. My little one just crying for momma constantly. But getting drunk and new dick is much more important. 

She says she wants to carry on with a divorce and she done and keeps bringing up fights from 12-14 years ago. She even admits to me that she slept with 5 guys including 2 of my friends during our separation 8 years ago. Crushed again. Just a gut punch. She says shes going to get an apartment in a couple months and she knows shes legally allowed to stay in the house until the divorce is final and I have no choice but to allow it. I threw away all the VS lingerie and sex toys I could find though since I paid for it. She said she doesn't care. She'll just buy more. She does. Every time she comes in my door she has a new VS bag in her hand. This woman never once did that for me. Not even in the beginning.

Let's get to last Thursday. I can't take not knowing what happened to me. I have her followed after work. She goes to all her regular spots and comes out of all of them with bags. I should note that our youngest is in daycare and they close at 6pm. She gets off around 3pm. She never picks him up until 6pm though. She's not interested in being a mom anymore and that part is driving me crazy. She was always very invested in our kids. Even her family is shocked by her behavior and we even become concerned that she's having a manic episode coupled with a Midlife Crisis. Thursday night I ask a coworker to follow me home from work and then follow her when she takes off. She agrees. 

I get home and she always wants to come outside and chat for 10-15 minutes before she abandons us for her new life. Won't even stay in the room put together for her even though she claims to have work early in the morning. Going out for drinks and dick is much more important. She even caused major problems sleeping in the other room because she claimed she needed the peace to sleep to ready for work. That was a lie. So we chat. She says shes meeting her sister for drinks. She leaves, and I see my coworker on her quickly. She calls me immediately. She says okay, I'm on her. She tells me she is absolutely booking it. 95mph on the freeway. She can keep up though. She follows her all the way to a bar in downtown. About 25 minutes away. She sends the address and I meet her there. 

I get there and relieve her. I thank her and promise to get her coffee and lunch all week. She's just excited to find out what's been going on. I wait outside this shitty litte nothing ass bar for almost 3 hours when I see her come out. Clearly drunk. All hoed out. I see her following a small black Audi. An old one. They speed and drive erratically to another bar about a mile away. A cooler spot. I see them park. She gets out. He gets out. Its her tattoo artist. Hes like 3-4 inches shorter than her. Thinning hair. Dressed like a teenager. Horrible fat gut. Almost looks medical. Seriously? This guy? You threw me and your kids and your brand new house away on this troll? Ugh. I see them dancing sloppily, stumbling across the street to this bar where they don't come out until 2:20am. They stumble across the street and immediately start making out with their hands in each other's pants in the parking lot. Then they seemingly go to get into their cars, but he stops and goes around the front of her truck and she gets on her knees. In the fucking parking lot. I'm gutted. I blew my horn and started my car and startled the shit out of them. They got into their cars and again drove clearly drunk and very erratically to his apartment. Shitty old tiny apartment. I Google the place and they only have efficiencies. This is what she left me for? 

I confronted her and told her I knew who.it was. She admitted that it started the day she met with him to discuss tattoo ideas. She literally told me to my face that the instant he touched her arm she threw herself at him. I told her okay. The timeline doesn't add up. What about the day you lied about being at your mom's? She said ugh. That really WAS a guy she met at the restaurant. I said okay. So what about the night you claim to have been at a friend's house because you were upset about your mom? She said that was a different guy she met at the restaurant. She said she was eith him on my birthday too. So wait 3 guys? And you left your sick kids at home and used your dying mom as an excuse to go fuck someone? What a vile repulsive creature.

We signed all the papers last night. I just don't even know where to go from here. How do you recover from this? I'm sure I'm leaving things out, but this was a lot and I'm emotionally and physically exhausted.

I've started looking more and more into narcissistic abuse and the more I read the more familiar it seems. She cut me off from friends and family. I was always walking on eggshells around her and keeping the peace. She's constantly bringing up fights from over a decade ago. She plays tit for tat with everything. Made me quit bands I was in. Made me throw away friends. Made me get this job. Made me buy this house. Wouldn't let me decorate the house at all. Very controlling and manipulative. Always weaponizing sex and withholding it. Then I look at some porn and I'm a pervert and she's the victim. She was always secretive with her phone, but I trusted her. She always  had a password I didn't know, but I never had a password on my phone. She always kept her maiden name on social media, but I wasn't allowed to have social media. Her friends lists and follows are all guys and exes. When I would confront her about it she'd turn it on me and tell me I'm overreacting. She's a slob. Blows her nose in her shirt. Leaves food everywhere. Doesn't cook or clean anything. Constant skid marks and snail trails in her underwear. Which is nuts because she's a knockout. You'd never guess. Smelliest genitals I've ever encountered. Turns out I've been with a narcissist for 15 years and the person I thought I loved doesnt exist. My therapist is certain she is based on recent events. I guess this was the discard and the new guy is the new supply and what's going on now is called love bombing. How did my life get here? ",1,1760292319.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

I’d wake up tired, drag myself through work, and crash the second I got home. I’m 42, living in Denver, Colorado, and I used to think this was just part of getting older — that afternoon energy crashes, bloating, and that foggy feeling were just something I had to live with.

It got bad enough that my kids started teasing me about how I’d “fall asleep faster than Netflix could load.” I laughed it off, but honestly, I hated it. I missed feeling alive. Coffee stopped working, and even after eating “healthy,” I didn’t feel any better.

[One night, I was talking with my friend Melissa, who’s into health supplements. She mentioned she’d been using something that targeted mitochondrial health — basically, the little “energy factories” in our cells. I had no idea what that meant, but she said it helped her feel like her body finally woke up again. She told me about Mitolyn, which she’d started taking a few months earlier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1ix10k4/i_was_always_tireduntil_i_tried_mitolyn_for_30/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I didn’t jump on it right away. I researched, read through a few personal experiences online, and eventually decided, “Why not?”

The first couple of weeks, I didn’t expect much. But around week three, I started noticing I wasn’t crashing as hard in the afternoons. My focus at work improved, I wasn’t reaching for sugary snacks all the time, and I even started going on evening walks again — something I hadn’t done in years.

By the end of the second month, the difference was honestly surprising. My sleep felt deeper, my mornings were easier, and for once, I felt like my body was actually working with me, not against me.

It’s not a magic pill — nothing is — but for me, it felt like my system got a reset. I’ve tried so many things over the years, but this was the first time I noticed a real, steady improvement without feeling jittery or off-balance.

If you’ve ever felt like your body just won’t keep up no matter what you do, you might get what I mean.",1,1760292307.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

1o4w233,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Ideas/comments/1o4w233/ice_creamcoffee_stand_what_am_i_missing/,Ice cream/coffee stand. What am I missing?,"There is a commercial property for sale near me that I have always thought would make a great spot for an ice cream and/or coffee spot because it overlooks a waterfall and has nice mountain views. We are in a rural area but the property is on a state highway that is the main artery through the area. Its also only 10 minutes from a much higher population density area with a state university. There is no local competition in town for ice cream and the only coffee competitor is a gas station with no drive through. 

The asking price for the lot is $45k, it is basically empty but does have an older parking lot and concrete pad that would need to be torn up and re done There is also a pole and frame for a lighted sign by the road for whatever business was there years ago. I would also want to take down a few trees at the back of the lot to open up the views a bit more. My plan would be to clean up the lot as described, bring in the town sewer, water, and electric from the road, install a smaller pre fab building, preferably with a separate drive through window for coffee and an ice cream window on the other side. Build a medium to large deck for outdoor dining looking down at the water. 

I plugged all that into ChatGPT (roast me if you must) with some assumptions and instructions on estimating and it came up with about $240k as initial outlay. I have some home equity I could pull on and the rest would be a business loan. I had it do some prospective cash flow plans and even the conservative ones show the business turning a profit very quickly assuming I am staffing it myself and with family. I’m not sure I believe it though, what am I missing here?

1o4w1w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/1o4w1w1/tates_yellowcard_review_is_so_well_written_it/,"Tate's Yellowcard review is so well written, it deserves to be posted.","This blank screen terrifies me. The cursor blinks. I search for the words. And in the back of my mind, there’s a cold little voice telling me it’s pointless. That I’ve said everything meaningful I’ll ever say about music. That I’m washed up and irrelevant. That the music I care most about, and the medium by which I communicate my love for that music, has passed me by. The voice whispers. And I hear the soundtrack to my life softly echo through my head like an abandoned radio station hallway. The florescent marquee sputtering, fizzling, and coughing up the bygones of a lost era. My era.

The empty space sits like a verdict — relentless, accusatory.

This is the kind of tension that comes with age. No one ever told me my youthful anxiety of never amounting to anything would morph into being worried I’ll only be remembered for what’s behind me. And it’s a funny kind of cruel, because I’m a little ashamed to admit it. But, honestly, I’ve been thinking about all of this a lot lately. The past, the glory days of the punk and emo scene. Growing up, giving in, the bands that have come and gone. And I’ve been thinking about the pressure that builds over time, how the momentum of *not doing* becomes intoxicating. By not doing, you never have to worry about failure. You can make up stories in your head about all the reasons it’s not worth trying, and your ego stays nice and protected.

But I’ve also been watching all these artists push against that pressure, lean against that momentum, and emerge bursting with creativity and a newfound sense of purpose. Freed of the shackles of needing to live up to the expectations of being the next big thing, or having to follow up their massive hit records, they’re able to tap into a creative force and deliver music that moves beyond just being a nostalgic feint. And it inspires me. I’ve been spending the past few months immersed in new music from the bands only we knew. Bands with funny names like Motion City Soundtrack, The Format, and The Starting Line. Little gems from our youth that always felt like a shared secret — ours and ours alone.

And that voice in my head? That one that tells me to stop trying, that no one reads anymore? That asks if our past is the best we will ever know? I know the antidote. I’ve known it most of my life. It involves headphones, a volume slider, and a great fucking song.

When I [last wrote](https://chorus.fm/reviews/yellowcard-yellowcard/) about [**Yellowcard**](https://chorus.fm/tag/yellowcard/), I did so thinking it would be the last album I ever reviewed from the band. I wrote about how endings hurt, but how that pain is a reflection of the beautiful thing you once held close. It stays with you *because* you care. I wrote about goodbyes and how closing the Yellowcard chapter of my life felt like saying goodbye to my youth. I was not just saying goodbye to the band that got me through the college years and into adulthood, but goodbye to the feeling their music imprinted on me like very few in history.

And that really did feel like the end.

Yellowcard, like me, internalized their goodbyes, played their final shows, and closed the book. For years, that chapter seemed sealed. But some endings pave way to new beginnings. What started as a [one-off reunion show](https://chorus.fm/news/yellowcard-reunite-at-riot-fest/) turned into a reminder, for them and for us, that their music still meant something. That spark led to [new songs](https://chorus.fm/news/yellowcard-announce-new-ep/) and before long the band was back in the studio, this time with [Travis Barker](https://chorus.fm/news/travis-barker-working-with-yellowcard/) behind the kit and the console. Out of what was once finality came something unexpected: another chance. What makes this second chance so compelling is how it reframes their history.

Because Yellowcard will always be the band with a runaway hit, a song that crowned and confined them in the same breath. “Ocean Avenue” was the kind of success so massive that it risks overshadowing everything else. And while in the years that followed, Yellowcard kept releasing great albums, I’ve always felt an internal tension running through them. A push and pull between wanting to replicate that success and the urge to stretch, evolve, and forge new paths. Across their career, they walked that tightrope gracefully.

And that’s what makes this new chapter so exciting. *Better Days* doesn’t sound like a band still chasing *Ocean Avenue*, it sounds like a band embracing the best of who they are. And in that freedom, they’ve created their catchiest, most immediate collection of songs since that breakthrough. It’s an album that embraces the joy of being Yellowcard.

It starts with “Better Days,” the lead single and title track. A song that stands as a mission statement for this new era and a song that gave the band their first number one hit in [twenty-two years](https://chorus.fm/linked/yellowcard-set-record-on-alternative-airplay-chart/). It sets the tone for a brisk thirty-two minutes of music that showcases a little of everything from the Yellowcard catalog. Energy, emotional resonance, soaring choruses, and big cinematic moments. A new anthem for a band that said goodbye only to return with an unexpected hit waiting for them on the other side. It’s a triumphant victory lap and a new beginning.

Where Yellowcard has always stood above the pack is in crafting incredible melodies that bounce out of the speakers. There is no better example than the chorus of “Take What You Want,” a song that positively punches the soul and ascends to pop-punk heaven. Sean’s violin leads the verses before exploding into an instantly hummable chorus with just the right amount of restraint from Travis. I started laughing the first time I heard it. Just to myself, muttering, “ok, so that’s a goddamn hook.”

Never a band to let up, “Love Letters Lost” is another early album highlight. Featuring guest vocals from the inimitable Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio, the guitar-forward track weaves in and out, reminding me of the best parts of *Paper Walls*. The vocal trade-off works perfectly with Matt’s gruff vocals blending with Ryan’s shine. The violin skirts tastefully throughout and using Matt on a track that opens with a line about vampires, and carries a verse like, “I was a photoshoot / just something for you to use / to show everyone how far you’ve come. But I wasn’t good enough / you wanted a royal one / And I didn’t have it in my blood,” is an inspired decision.

The album’s cackling energy pauses in the heart of the track listing with “You Broke Me Too” and “City of Angels.” The former, a power ballad featuring guest vocals from Avril Lavigne, almost plays as a counter-weight to *Ocean Avenue*’s “Only One.” Where “Only One” was youthful desperation — all-or-nothing heartbreak screamed into the void — “You Broke Me Too” comes from a place of lived-in understanding. The emotions are still sharp, but they’re tempered by experience. The chorus lifts with: “What I’ve been through, led me to you. You found me when I was broken / you let a little bit of hope in,” before crashing back to earth with the heartbreaking “but you, you broke me too.” The use of a guest vocalist here adds gravitas to the song as both parties come to the same crushing conclusion. It’s a grown-up kind of pain. And, this two-song run gives an otherwise very upbeat album a nice dramatic interlude.

“City of Angels” calls back to the electronic elements on *Lift a Sail* with its pulsating opening and ethereal feel. And whereas “City of Devils” on *Lights and Sounds* cursed the city, here Ryan sings of the hope that returning has given him. The song feels like an answer to that earlier bitterness, replacing frustration with gratitude. As the layers swell, the song begins to feel like a prayer — a soft utterance to oneself to remember the dreams you had all those years ago. To hold on to that ambition. To believe again. To fight the inner-voice of doubt and see the past not as a mountain you’ll never crest again, but the foundation of who you are.

In many ways, “Bedroom Posters” feels like the emotional center of the record. It’s a song about looking back without getting stuck. Travis Barker’s production keeps it grounded; it sounds modern without ever feeling overstuffed. The best thing about it is that you don’t really notice it working. It just lets the song breathe, giving space for the nostalgia and restlessness to sit side by side. And it’s within this nostalgia that I think about just how long this band has been in my life.

When I wrote about [*Paper Walls*](https://chorus.fm/reviews/yellowcard-paper-walls/) over eighteen long years ago, I talked about how the band has a knack for writing better pop-punk songs than just about anyone else. The core, base, Yellowcard experience can be defined not by the singles, but by the late album track that, in less capable hands, becomes filler. A song like *Paper Walls*’ “Afraid,” or *When You’re Through Thinking, Say Yes*’ “Hide.” These are songs that anchor and elevate these albums. They do it again here with “Skin Scrapped.” It’s quintessential Yellowcard. Building to a chorus punctuated by an unmistakable Travis Barker drum pattern. The transition between the chorus and verse pulls back, and the vocals distort through an almost unintelligible shout. It’s a small touch. The guitars lock in, the hook lands exactly where it should, and it’s a reminder of how effortlessly Yellowcard can make it look.

*Better Days* clocks in at just over 30 minutes. It feels fast. But it’s a tight thirty with every song feeling pertinent and considered.

The album closes with “Big Blue Eyes,” a mostly acoustic song written for Ryan’s son. It’s tender, stripped back, and unguarded. It lands like a quiet exhale — a reminder that the rawest moments aren’t just in breakup songs and summer anthems, but in the milestones of adulthood. That’s the thread running through *Better Days*: a record about the trials of life and finding new reasons to keep singing. Life happens, responsibilities pile up, but there’s still magic in capturing those fleeting moments and turning them into song.

We spend our youth waiting to grow up. Our elders warn us of the trappings of doing so too fast. And yet we speed along, only reflecting later, on lonely sleepless nights, of those days gone by. Along the way, we fall in love with music, and that music ends up becoming our tether to our former selves. Our former selves peer back at us in coffee shop windows, in collected rainwater, and in the sing-alongs we still have with those star-crossed songs.

But somewhere along the line, we’re told the story ends. That new music can’t matter the same way anymore. That the bands of our youth are finished, or that anything they release now is just a footnote in a career defined by our teenage hormones and heartbreaks. And so people write off late-career albums before they even hear them, or more often, never even realize the bands that meant so much to them are still releasing great music today.

Fuck that.

If you let them, late-career albums can take on their own kind of power. Maybe you don’t hear them the same way you did when you were 17 and summer felt stretched like a lifetime. Maybe they aren’t the balm to a life you’ve yet to define for yourself. But that doesn’t have to mean they matter less. The emotions are just as real, just as raw. These are albums to get married to. To raise a family with. To drive to baseball practice with, to change careers with, to play as you realize your parents are aging, or maybe just to spin on the grocery store drive before sitting outside with a mortgage and a beer.

Life doesn’t get quieter as you age, and your musical journey doesn’t have to be over just because your back hurts. It just looks different. And that’s the beauty of it. You’ll have the rest of your life to reminisce on this time right now. I’ve found that some of the best memories are made during moments you didn’t even know you’d miss. It’s why we can look back at our bad haircuts, strange outfit choices, awkward MySpace photos, and pathetic Facebook status updates with embarrassment and affection. The lived life looked back on is where we find the color, where memory paints in what the present couldn’t see. Where the blurred edges start to make sense and the moments arrange themselves into something that feels like ours.

Because what grew out of those nights in sweat-soaked halls, out of burned mixtapes painted with bold Sharpie stars, and long drives where your entire personality sat neatly in a CD binder stuffed under the seat, wasn’t just a phase. A generation of bands emerged that shaped us, that bind us to who we were, and that still have the ability to saturate who we are becoming. And maybe watching all the bands reunite and put out new music makes me fight off my own morality for just a little longer. But maybe that’s all we need. These songs are proof that we lived. Proof that we loved. Proof that this scene — our scene — meant something.

And that’s why albums like *Better Days* matter. They remind us that Yellowcard isn’t just a memory frozen in 2003. They’re a band still capable of greatness. They deserve their flowers now, not just as a nostalgia act, but as proof that creation and connection don’t expire. That we can always face down the voice telling us our better days are behind us. That favorite bands and new albums can still shiver our spines at all stages of life.

I want to believe we’ll be remembered for both the spark and the fire. Maybe it’s what we did in our youth, maybe it’s the second chance we never saw coming. But what Yellowcard proves is that you don’t have to choose. You can carry both.

It’s too easy to let the past define you — to sit back and let the highlight reel stand in for a whole life. It’s comforting to stay trapped in a celluloid memory. To point to the accolades of the past and say goals were achieved, dreams were reached. Another day passes. But what I know now is that goals and dreams aren’t fixed points.

I am not an oldies station.

Or maybe I am.

Or maybe I’m both things. A collection of who I was, what I did, and the music that I brought along with me. And when I spin that together with who I’ve become, I get to experience my life not with regret or tales of the way it was, but with an eye on the horizon. The unwritten story of your life needs you to live it. To write it. It’s there, ahead of us, just waiting for you to hit play.",0,1760292225.0,poppunkers,0,0.43,False

I wasn’t the brightest kid in the block. Average student kaya it’s a no-brainer that I landed an average job that pays just enough not to starve. And before shit happens, that was honestly enough. I can pay my bills and may tira pa. But with my mom’s recent health developments and my spiraling mental health, ang hirap hirap maging kapos. A 10K monthly medication expenses + oxygen refills + utilities + daily food expenses. Sabi nga ni Regine, hindi ko na alam kung makakaya ko pa. Hahaha.

Tbh, gusto kong magpuntang psych for assessment. There are days when I would just wake up and start crying. There are days when the anxiety runs so deep I wasn’t able to eat properly for days. Anything that I would try to digest during those times, isusuka lang ng katawan ko. I would sleep late and wake up early. I get so jumpy over messenger calls or whenever I get chat from my brother. That little “Ate, gising ka?” because that usually means another trip to the hospital. Minsan I would just wake up in the middle of sleeping – my heart beating so loudly while I check my phone. Or I would go down to check on my Mom if she’s still fine.

Alam kong hindi naman ‘to notmal kaso ang hirap. Oo nga’t may mga libreng hospital and consultations, pero paano ang pamasahe? Kung may gamot na irereseta? Saan ko ‘yon isisingit sa nakakalunod na gastusin sa bahay?

There are times na I would just downplay everything, na baka I just need to unwind and switch off everything for a moment. I’m working from home and only needs to report to office once a month. Baka naman malungkot lang ako? Baka…I’m just lonely and needs to meet my friends. But that needs money too. But they all live in a different cities. Best bet na magkita half-way. Kaso kailangan pa din ng pera para makita sila. A coffee date? How I wish. Kahit 7/11 na kape pa yan. Sometimes they would offer to pay for my share pero nakakahiya naman. May sarili din silang gastusin sa bahay. Kaya pag nagyayaya sila, I would just simply decline. Or hindi na lang ako magsi-seen.

I just turned 30 and haven’t really dated properly and sometimes, I want to. I wanna go on dates. I want my own kismet moment. But I know for a fact that love and relationship needs time, commitment, perseverance and money. And with all that’s been happening, love is something that I cannot simply afford right now.

Nag-chat sa akin yung friend ko, asking kung kumusta na ako kasi it’s so unlike me to be silent on socmed. She was worried I might do something stupid. I jokingly said “Huwag kang mag-alala, di ‘ko gagawin ‘yon teh kasi mahal ang kabaong at palibing. Mukha ba akong may pera para ‘don?”.
And it is true.


Sabi nila, money can’t buy you happiness pero para sa mga taong gaya kong pinanganak na hindi naman kagalingan at walang yaman, mali sila.

1o4vzr5,https://i.redd.it/efbwfzk50quf1.jpeg,PNW Halloween Car-Camping Weekend (Seattle → Kelso → St. Helens),"We’re heading out from Seattle for a Halloween weekend that blends cozy camping, horror flicks, and a few classic Pacific Northwest fall stops — all powered by our 2026 Rivian R1S. It’s our annual “campfire-and-creepshow” tradition, and this year’s setup is simple but dialed-in.

We’re base-camping at Seaquest SP near Castle Rock, WA, keeping the footprint light: the Kammok Crosswing stretched off the driver’s side, our North Face Wawona 6 tent for gear and hangout space, and sleeping in the R1S itself on Hest Rivian Float pads with our usual Kelty Wayback 20s and Rumpl blankets. Lighting is all BioLite — string lights and multicolor lanterns — plus the warm glow of our Ignik Fire Can. Water’s handled by the Dometic GO 11 L jug + faucet, coffee and meals by the Nuwave induction and Jackery 1000. The dogs are, of course, along for the ride.

⸻

The Plan

Friday night:
We’ll leave Seattle mid-afternoon and aim to reach camp before dark. Once the Crosswing’s up and the fire can’s lit, we’ll roll out to the Cinema of Horrors Drive-In for a showing of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (2003) — nothing like watching that classic under the fall sky. Afterwards it’s back to camp for drinks and s’mores by the fire.

Saturday:
Slow morning with coffee and chai and maybe a short trail walk nearby. Then we’ll drive down to St. Helens, Oregon, to wander through Halloweentown — it’s fully decked out this time of year with props from the movies, live events, and plenty of small-town charm. On the way back north, we’ll swing by the Kelso Tesla Supercharger (R1S + NACS adapter works great) for a top-up before heading to the Cinema of Horrors Haunted House that night. After that, it’s straight back to camp for drinks, firelight, and decompressing under the BioLites.

Sunday:
One last lazy morning, a rinse with the Dometic spout, maybe another quick hike, then a final top-off before cruising home to Seattle.

⸻

It’s the perfect kind of weekend: no heavy setup, just a warm car, good lights, good company, and a few intentional scares. If anyone’s planning a similar Halloween road-camp from Seattle, the Kelso area makes a great hub — lots to do within an hour’s drive and easy charging all weekend.

Any can’t-miss dog-friendly fall spots between Kelso and St. Helens? Or favorite coffee near the Kelso Supercharger? Always down to add another spooky detour to the list.

👻 See you out there, and happy haunting!

1o4vzmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1o4vzmx/aita_for_being_upset_my_exhusbands_mom_keeps/,AITA for being upset my ex-husband's mom keeps commenting crying emojis on all my social media posts after he exposed me?,"I thought my husband would come crawling back but instead he disappeared and now his mom won't stop commenting crying emojis on every single one of my Instagram posts.

I cheated. There it is. Six months ago I reconnected with my ex at a work conference and we slept together twice. My husband found texts on my phone while I was in the shower. He didn't yell or throw things. He just asked me if it was true and when I couldn't lie he said okay and left.

That same night my sister called me. She'd heard from someone that my husband was upset. I broke down and told her everything but instead of talking about my marriage I spent two hours crying about how my ex had been texting less and acting distant. She told my mom. My mom told my dad. Next thing I know my whole family is calling my husband weak and saying he needs to man up and forgive me because marriages go through rough patches.

My dad actually showed up at my husband's new apartment. My husband wouldn't let him in so my dad stood in the hallway yelling about how real men fight for their wives. A neighbor called building security.

I kept texting my husband. He wouldn't respond. I called thirty times in one day. Nothing. Then I got desperate and posted on Facebook about how hard marriage is and how people give up too easily. I didn't mention the cheating obviously. Just vague stuff about fighting for love.

That's when everything exploded.

My husband posted screenshots. All of them. The texts between me and my ex. The messages where I told my ex I'd leave my husband if he wanted me to. My family's threatening messages to him. Even a voice note where I was crying about how my ex wouldn't commit while my husband was literally packing his stuff in the background.

He captioned it all with one sentence. ""For everyone asking why I left.""

His friends shared it. His coworkers saw it. My coworkers saw it. My boss saw it. That post got over four hundred shares before I reported it and got it taken down but the damage was done.

Now everyone thinks he's this strong guy who respected himself enough to walk away. Women comment on his posts calling him king and saying he deserves better. His gym buddy posted a photo of them together with some caption about real strength and it got thousands of likes.

Meanwhile I'm the villain. My friends barely talk to me. Two of them blocked me completely. My cousin uninvited me from her wedding. Someone left a note on my car that said ""home wrecker"" and I don't even know who.

But the worst part is his mom.

She comments on everything I post. Recipe video. Crying emoji. Selfie. Crying emoji. Motivational quote. Crying emoji. She's not even saying anything just crying emojis but everyone sees it and knows what it means. I blocked her on Instagram so she moved to Facebook. I blocked her there so she started commenting on my Pinterest boards.

My ex won't talk to me anymore either. After everything came out he said I was too messy and he couldn't deal with drama. He's already dating someone new.

My family still thinks my husband overreacted. My mom keeps saying he's being vindictive and cruel. My dad wants to call his work and report him for harassment even though posting screenshots isn't illegal. They don't get that they made everything worse.

I wake up every day in our house surrounded by his stuff that he didn't take. His coffee mug. His books. His toolbox in the garage. Sometimes I smell his cologne on the couch and it makes me physically sick. Not because I miss him exactly but because I destroyed something good and now I'm living in its rotting corpse.

He changed his number. Deleted all social media except the one post that ruined my life. Moved two hours away. I heard through mutual friends that he's doing great. Going to therapy. Dating. Happy.

I'm still here defending myself to strangers online and dodging crying emojis.

Was I wrong to expect my family to have my back even though I was the one who messed up?

1o4vxoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1o4vxoz/wildest_story_youve_ever_heard/,Wildest story you've ever heard,"Just signed the divorce papers yesterday, so no worries. Also happened to be the one year anniversary of the day we moved into this house I just had built for her. 

I (M42) have been married to my wife (F36) for 13 years. We dated for 2 years. Separated once 8 years ago for about 5 months. We have 3 children together, ages 2 1/2, 11, and 13. I loved her like crazy. I was obsessed with my wife. I couldn't wait to come home to her. I bought her anything she wanted even if we didn't really have the money. Even if I had to sell my things to get it. I told her I loved her every day. I told her she was gorgeous every day. I supported her for all the time we were together. 

About 2 months ago, she returned from a trip to visit family out of state that cost me $4K. I tried to convince her it wasn't a great idea, but she lashed out at me and called me names. She was there 2 weeks. I missed her hard and she appeared to miss me as well. Sending nudes, having phone sex, telling me she couldnt wait to get home. I finished all my honey do lists and the house was spotless and I even worked a ton of overtime because no one was home so the paychecks were chunky. 

The night I picked her up from the airport I could sense something was a tad off. She was frustrated with me very quickly. It was a far cry from the energy we shared on the phone. We did have sex that night so i just chalked it up to it being a rough trip. She said she didn't have much fun and being on a plane with 3 kids is stressful. 

We were in marriage therapy at a wonderful place and had gone to maybe 15 sessions before the trip. It was mostly for a mild porn addiction I have and her spending problems and routine maintenance. She came to one session after the trip and then she just quit. She decided she didn't want to go anymore. She made excuses. She was tired. Work changed her schedule. She didn't feel well. I went to the last 3 sessions by myself. The therapist had to end it because it was unethical to see me and talk about her. I get it. But in the very last session she said something that was very unnerving. My mom is a narcissist and she and my wife hate each other. But they're very similar. She asked me if I was afraid that my wife could possibly be a narcissist. I thought no way. I didn't bring it up to her. 

Over the course of the next 2 weeks I witnessed alarming changes and glowing red flags. I work a hard job and its 2nd shift, so I come home kinda late. Around 10pm. I came home one night and found her in the bathtub shaving her bush. I was immediately like, ""Who is THAT for? I didn't ask you to do that."" I like the bush. She claimed she just wanted to groom to feel cleaner and prettier. She had also gotten on Ozempic about a month before the trip so I was noticing an obvious weight loss. She was around 185 before and around 160 when she got back. Then she started using workout equipment in the garage. And doing it naked. When I'd go in there to say something she'd get an attitude with me and tell me to leave her be. I started noticing the Victoria's Secret and Sephora bags. Constantly. I never got to see her in any of these items, but it was hundreds of dollars per visit. Close to $1k per week in spending on lingerie and makeup.

More weight started to fall off and our bedroom was all but dead and that's when I confronted her. She called me crazy. Assured me nothing was going on. It's also important to note she started her first job about 9 months ago waitressing at a popular brunch spot for extra cash and the schedule was great for the kids school schedule. She started getting very involved with her coworkers. All of them very attractive, but much younger girls. 12-15 years younger and all single and wild. Always hanging out with them. Spa days. Activities. Mimosas on her days off. She said she was starting to feel alive and feel like a real person. I was happy for her. It got excessive quickly. Even when our household got sick. We were sick for about 4 weeks straight. It didn't stop her at all. Started drinking regularly. Using different words and dressing differently. It was a drastic and sudden change that jarred me. 

Then she started talking about getting a tattoo. That was about 5 weeks ago. She showed me a guy that's pretty well known locally that she happened to have grown uo with. A sloppy looking fellow, but his work was good and she said he was a good dude. She was very promiscuous before we met and after all the red flags I had been seeing, I had to ask. ""Did you ever sleep with him?"" Man, she exploded. It was like I accused her of murder. She assured me that I was insane for asking such a thing. He was very unattractive. I believed her. Moved past it. She started talking to him more and seeing him to work on ideas for this massive double sleeve neck piece. She says her mom is paying for it. Her mom pays for a lot so that wasnt alarming. 

She was upset about her mom being sick and one night begged me if she could go hang out with this coworker she liked. She said they were gonna grab a few drinks and talk and I let her. I thought nothing of it. This event will come back into play later. 

Like I mentioned before, we were sick. Strep throat. One night I can hear her coughing upstairs. I guess I should also mention she started sleeping in another bedroom upstairs because the 2 year old sleeps with us and because she has to be up early she says he makes it hard for her to sleep. Again, that leads to our bedroom being completely dead. And when I'd go up to check on her she'd be awake on her phone. She'd get furious at me for checking on her and she'd say I was treating her like a child. I'd say I was upset that she was sleeping elsewhere and I missed her and she would call me selfish. So, one night shes coughing bad and I'm concerned so I go check on her. I tell her she needs to go to the doctor and get on antibiotics because we have strep and over thr counter meds aren't gonna cut it. She says she's going to work and she'll go to the doctor if she still feels bad. 

So the next day I get up and take kids to school and head to work. Again, I should note that I pass her restaurant on my way to work. Its so easy to see if her truck is there. This day it's not. I swing in to grab my lunch at the restaurant next door and I see her manager standing outside. I asked him if she went to the doctor and he said she wasn't scheduled today. My heart sinks and my stomach turns. I started calling and texting to no avail. I check the parking lot at her doctors office and both emergency rooms nearby and she's not there. I finally hear back from her about 2 hours into my shift. She claims to have gone to see her mom and sister. I asked if she went to the doctor and she said yes. I said you weren't at the places I checked. She said, oh I was at the small ER closer to our house. Our older kids were so sick they stayed home from school. I said so, you passed our gouse where our sick kids are waiting on you to visit your mom and sister? She's like yeah. It's not weird. Dont act like it's weird. Alarms are going off. Her mom is also very sick. She was just diagnosed with lung cancer. So I let it slide. 

We were watching a scary movie one night in the living room. That felt nice. It was very good and when the movie ended I tried to cuddle with her and she pushed me away and said we just watched a scary movie and I'm very overstimulated. But she didn't say it nicely and her face said much more. Then she casually asked me to get her something from the pantry. I got up to go get it, opened the pantry door, and just started bawling. Sobbing uncontrollably. She whipped her head around and started screaming at me. ""Whats wrong? What's wrong with you? What is happening?"" I told her I didn't know, but I know now. I could feel the disconnect. I could feel her slipping away. 

My birthday passes and I'm very sick and still had to work. I never got a gift from her. Never even the words happy birthday. When I got home from work that night she said to me, ""Why does your birthday always suck?"" Maybe because you dont give a shit to make it decent? I dunno. I get a bonus around her birthday every year and its always extravagant. She does nothing for me. Never even cooked me a meal. Never even worn a piece of lingerie for me. 

Then things start to get real weird. Always on her phone. Never looking at me. Never sitting on the same piece of furniture I'm on. Always smiling at her phone. I cant get her attention for anything. She won't look at me. She won't speak to me. Bedroom dead, but she looks amazing and is always naked. New Victoria's Secret bags everywhere. She even had me take her to the big one in the mall and let me help her pick out some stuff. It's almost $500, but I don't even care. Nothing happens that night. I don't get to see her in any of it. She did give me the most random oral ever about 2 nights later. I figure its just a rough patch because we were all sick and her trip was bad and the money kind of hurt us. Maybe things will go back to normal. 

Then the freeze out continues. But it's even worse. It doesn't last long. Tattoo day comes. It's Friday September 26th. My sister's birthday. But she's isolated me from my family so I have no plans with her.  I work all day and I don't hear from her once. I get home and she's not home. I ask my older kids where she is and they have no idea. I know in my gut something is going on and I call her absolutely livid. She picks up and I said ""Where the fuck are you?"" She literally responded, ""I'm done. I'm just done. I've checked out and I'm finished with you."" She hangs up, gets home about 20 minutes later. She claims to have been at this coworker girls apartment. She still has the saran wrap around her new tattoo. I don't care to see it. I try asking what happened? Can we work on this? We were in therapy, let's go back. She said that place sucked and I hated that bitch. All she did was give you excuses for your abuse and excuses for your porn when you're just a pervert and you don't love me. I leaned into it. I told her she was right. I'm horrible. I'll fix myself. Ive ruined everything. Please let's work this out. She was cold. Unfeeling. Checked out. 

The next day I'm determined to do something about this. I'm bawling. Sobbing uncontrollably. Didn't sleep much. Not hungry at all. I call her mom. We start talking and I asked about the day she came to see her. She says she hasn't seen her in months. Boom. I knew it. My spidey sense was right. I confronted her when she got home from work. She says there's another man and she loves him. She says intimacy with him is transcendent and she has never felt this way about another person. 

Our kids are crying. My 13 yo son is threatening to kill himself. My 11 yo daughter told her to get her cheating ass away from her dad. She admitted this right in front of them. They stay in my room crying with me while we try to figure out what's going on and what we can do. She walks in naked after showering upstairs like nothing is wrong. She's down to 115lbs now. Nipples hard. Fresh tan. Tiny little landing strip. New tats. New nose piercings. Just all out in front of the kids. She gets ready in some very skimpy and completely see through nighty. With thick heels on and leaves. She went to see him looking like that. She even turned and smiled at me on her way out the door. She did this again Sunday night as well. 

Monday I call my company lawyer and have him start getting divorce papers ready, but I'm nowhere near done. She's claiming this is a guy she met while working at the restaurant. She says he had been coming in for a while and was very persistent and one day she caved and fell for him immediately. There has been so much lying that I don't buy it. There are days of me researching. Begging her and pleading with her to stay. Think of the kids. I just built you this house. You have health insurance with me. Youre safe with me. I tried everything. She's desd set. She's in love. She goes out with him every night. She won't stay in the house at all anymore. So I'm parenting all 3 kids and working the bread winning job. All while being emotionally destroyed, sleep-deprived, and starved. Constantly breaking down and sobbing. Even at work. I got sent home twice that first week and even fainted for the first time in my life. I am eviscerated. My kids are devasted. My little one just crying for momma constantly. But getting drunk and new dick is much more important. 

She says she wants to carry on with a divorce and she done and keeps bringing up fights from 12-14 years ago. She even admits to me that she slept with 5 guys including 2 of my friends during our separation 8 years ago. Crushed again. Just a gut punch. She says shes going to get an apartment in a couple months and she knows shes legally allowed to stay in the house until the divorce is final and I have no choice but to allow it. I threw away all the VS lingerie and sex toys I could find though since I paid for it. She said she doesn't care. She'll just buy more. She does. Every time she comes in my door she has a new VS bag in her hand. This woman never once did that for me. Not even in the beginning.

Let's get to last Thursday. I can't take not knowing what happened to me. I have her followed after work. She goes to all her regular spots and comes out of all of them with bags. I should note that our youngest is in daycare and they close at 6pm. She gets off around 3pm. She never picks him up until 6pm though. She's not interested in being a mom anymore and that part is driving me crazy. She was always very invested in our kids. Even her family is shocked by her behavior and we even become concerned that she's having a manic episode coupled with a Midlife Crisis. Thursday night I ask a coworker to follow me home from work and then follow her when she takes off. She agrees. 

I get home and she always wants to come outside and chat for 10-15 minutes before she abandons us for her new life. Won't even stay in the room put together for her even though she claims to have work early in the morning. Going out for drinks and dick is much more important. She even caused major problems sleeping in the other room because she claimed she needed the peace to sleep to ready for work. That was a lie. So we chat. She says shes meeting her sister for drinks. She leaves, and I see my coworker on her quickly. She calls me immediately. She says okay, I'm on her. She tells me she is absolutely booking it. 95mph on the freeway. She can keep up though. She follows her all the way to a bar in downtown. About 25 minutes away. She sends the address and I meet her there. 

I get there and relieve her. I thank her and promise to get her coffee and lunch all week. She's just excited to find out what's been going on. I wait outside this shitty litte nothing ass bar for almost 3 hours when I see her come out. Clearly drunk. All hoed out. I see her following a small black Audi. An old one. They speed and drive erratically to another bar about a mile away. A cooler spot. I see them park. She gets out. He gets out. Its her tattoo artist. Hes like 3-4 inches shorter than her. Thinning hair. Dressed like a teenager. Horrible fat gut. Almost looks medical. Seriously? This guy? You threw me and your kids and your brand new house away on this troll? Ugh. I see them dancing sloppily, stumbling across the street to this bar where they don't come out until 2:20am. They stumble across the street and immediately start making out with their hands in each other's pants in the parking lot. Then they seemingly go to get into their cars, but he stops and goes around the front of her truck and she gets on her knees. In the fucking parking lot. I'm gutted. I blew my horn and started my car and startled the shit out of them. They got into their cars and again drove clearly drunk and very erratically to his apartment. Shitty old tiny apartment. I Google the place and they only have efficiencies. This is what she left me for? 

I confronted her and told her I knew who.it was. She admitted that it started the day she met with him to discuss tattoo ideas. She literally told me to my face that the instant he touched her arm she threw herself at him. I told her okay. The timeline doesn't add up. What about the day you lied about being at your mom's? She said ugh. That really WAS a guy she met at the restaurant. I said okay. So what about the night you claim to have been at a friend's house because you were upset about your mom? She said that was a different guy she met at the restaurant. She said she was eith him on my birthday too. So wait 3 guys? And you left your sick kids at home and used your dying mom as an excuse to go fuck someone? What a vile repulsive creature.

We signed all the papers last night. I just don't even know where to go from here. How do you recover from this? I'm sure I'm leaving things out, but this was a lot and I'm emotionally and physically exhausted.

I've started looking more and more into narcissistic abuse and the more I read the more familiar it seems. She cut me off from friends and family. I was always walking on eggshells around her and keeping the peace. She's constantly bringing up fights from over a decade ago. She plays tit for tat with everything. Made me quit bands I was in. Made me throw away friends. Made me get this job. Made me buy this house. Wouldn't let me decorate the house at all. Very controlling and manipulative. Always weaponizing sex and withholding it. Then I look at some porn and I'm a pervert and she's the victim. She was always secretive with her phone, but I trusted her. She always  had a password I didn't know, but I never had a password on my phone. She always kept her maiden name on social media, but I wasn't allowed to have social media. Her friends lists and follows are all guys and exes. When I would confront her about it she'd turn it on me and tell me I'm overreacting. She's a slob. Blows her nose in her shirt. Leaves food everywhere. Doesn't cook or clean anything. Constant skid marks and snail trails in her underwear. Which is nuts because she's a knockout. You'd never guess. Smelliest genitals I've ever encountered. Turns out I've been with a narcissist for 15 years and the person I thought I loved doesnt exist. My therapist is certain she is based on recent events. I guess this was the discard and the new guy is the new supply and what's going on now is called love bombing. How did my life get here? ",1,1760291976.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

1o4vvqb,https://youtube.com/watch?v=A8G8QrtQ43c&si=0geI9XMem17vpJUz,It Was Interesting,"It had its moments... or maybe, It was interesting. That’s the joke.

A Canadian’s perspective on the man in the big house.
A specific flavor of hate, a global tension,
The constant noise from south of the border you can’t turn off.
It’s not just politics; it’s a personal annoyance, a loud, vulgar stain.
I am waiting for the news flash, the collective sigh of a worried world.
No explanation needed, yet all the explanation in the world.
The relief will be palpable, a quiet shift in the planet's orbit.
We all have our own reasons, but this one is universal exhaustion.

The old man in the black cloak is also waiting,
Sharpening his scythe with a grin that stretches forever.
He has a VIP section reserved, a special table.
He can’t wait to get his hands on that particular soul.

Waiting for him to die.
Waiting for him to die.

He just turned 24, but he stopped growing at 15,
A street-smart kid coasting, milking the system dry.
Drug addiction and alcoholism, a black hole of take, take, take.
He's sailing straight for the cliff, the age-out limit looming large.
No high school diploma, no job, just a rude awakening on the sidewalk.
We love him, but he’s already lost, a ghost in the community.
It’s a merciful thought, a way to end the endless taking, the slow burn.
The family, the neighborhood, even the system itself is waiting.

Death is leaning on a lamppost, checking his watch,
A hungry Grim Reaper ready to collect on a long-past due invoice.
He sees the future: homeless and cold, a predictable end game.
He’s excited for this one; they always taste the sweetest when they've suffered.

Waiting for him to die.
Waiting for him to die.

Two years since the stroke, a near-vegetative fraction of a man.
The intimidating figure of my youth reduced to a 95-pound weakling.
Strangely, the estrangement ended, replaced by affection and quiet Sunday readings.
We bring him coffee and donuts, a gentle ritual for a fading memory.
He still manages a smile, a fleeting glimpse of the old personality.
He hangs on, defying the doctors, a surprise to my brother and me.
A gentle soul now, agreeable and kind, but this slow fade is cruel.
We go every week, bringing stories and waiting for the bed to be empty.

Death is sitting bedside, patiently, knitting a shroud.
He finds this one a little boring, a soul already three-quarters gone.
But a soul is a soul, and he will wait for the final, rattling breath.
He respects the longevity, but he's ready for the curtain call.

Waiting for him to die.
Waiting for him to die.

Age 52, a hermit, a misfit, sending over a thousand résumés.
A middle-aged white male society doesn't want to hire.
Financially supported, my self-esteem and confidence in the basement.
My children don't have much use for me; my relationship is just mediocre.
This deteriorating body, this constant struggle, this suffering from my own choices.
I’ve had glimpses of joy, but the party must be better on the other side.
I look at that guy, the reclusive one, and feel the truth of the wish.
It’s been a theme, a quiet thought: just let this stupid life experience end.

Death is standing right behind me, peering over my shoulder.
He sees the longing, the weariness, the desire for the ultimate exit.
He thinks this one is an eager customer, a willing volunteer.
He is preparing the clever note himself: ""It was interesting.""

Waiting for him to die.
Waiting for him to die.

1o4vtqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emilie_Kiser/comments/1o4vtqo/grief_doesnt_always_look_like_grief/,Grief doesn’t always look like grief,"I only learned about this influencer after the tragic accident. I came across this page by chance, and since I’m a certified therapist, I feel I should share a few thoughts. First of all, I completely disagree with using children in content creation. Every child has a right to privacy and autonomy, and it’s a parent’s duty to protect that. A child is not an extension of their parent they are a separate human being with their own identity and sense of self. Involving a child in content, especially when money is being made from it, is a form of exploitation and to put it mildly, it’s unethical. When it comes to grief, I want to share something important. I’ve noticed there are many people who judge the way she grieves and her content. In the most devastating, unimaginable moments in life, when it feels like the ground has completely fallen away, what helps the most is routine and the familiar rhythm of daily life. Any therapist will tell you that. Finding small, ordinary moments that once brought comfort or joy can be deeply healing. For her, that might be TikTok, makeup, home decorating - things like that. And honestly, I can almost guarantee these are recommendations from her therapist: go outside, meet friends, do your makeup, decorate your home. These are all small but powerful ways to stay grounded when everything inside you feels broken. And with ten years of experience as a therapist, I can tell you with absolute certainty — you cannot measure someone else’s pain from the outside. You can’t know how much another person is suffering. The fact that she doesn’t talk about her grief or about what happened doesn’t mean she doesn’t care. It means she’s not ready not that it’s unimportant to her. In fact, it’s usually the opposite, she’s so deeply wounded that she simply can’t talk about it yet. And honestly, if she could, so soon, that would be far stranger than seeing her try to find small moments of normalcy - a coffee, a bit of shopping, tiny glimpses of everyday life.

1o4vrlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EthericMinds/comments/1o4vrlt/chapter_4_cracked_open/,Chapter 4 - Cracked open,"I was walking around in my new life like a zombie. I had nowhere I needed to be, nothing I had to do – just floating around in limbo-land. This made me attach to Albert like a leech, and my independence vanished. It still amazes me how fast it happened, and that I somehow had no control over it. My soul was indeed fighting it,  but like a moth – he was my light and I was stuck in his orbit, swirling endlessly. I was so lost in the sauce that Albert was the only one who could make me feel confident, loved, valued and worthy. My days had no meaning if I wasn’t with him. It pains me thinking back on this, but it is the truth, and that was my reality. Without understanding why, I gradually felt more lost, grumpy and just overall destructive every time I felt not chosen, not prioritized and not important. I was drowning in confusion, sorrow and emotional torture – and I did a good job dragging Albert down with me. Nothing and no one could reach me with logic. I was screaming for help with one hand, while shoving everyone away with the other. No wonder my guides struggled to get through to me. Here I was, desperate for help – yet, I never took the time to stop and listen. That’s when divine intervention has no other choice than to become physical.  
  
I was running away from answers, so naturally my guides had to pull the emergency breaks on my life, and threw me headfirst into a wall of truth. Before all this I was never really sick. I was as healthy as one could be. But now – my body was constantly fighting something. And the more I “ignored” silence, solitude – listening, the worse it got. Since I was 14 years old I had been struggling with sleep paralysis. I thought I had befriended this phenomenon, but during this time it made its return. More intense each time. My entire body started to tense up – aching, migraines, heart palpitations, constantly feeling off and exhausted. Eventually I was walking around like a sluggish Quasimodo – again, blissfully ignoring the messages I had been asking for. The final straw was when I started feeling this intense pulling in my chest. A mixture of anxiety, fear, heart failure – however, there was a mystical, slightly hidden sense of motivation and hope mixed in the soup. It was extremely uncomfortable and I had a few moments thinking this had to be the end of me. Which – funny enough – was true. The beginning of the end if you will. It started very subtle, but grew to become a constant aching. Stronger and stronger, until I no longer could ignore it. This was the point I was forced to the ground – I waved the white flag, paused, and slowly opened up to listen.  
  
In a moment of defeat I had a sudden download about the term shadow work. I had heard about it a few times, and how hard it is to go through, but I never really understood how to go forward with the process. I also had a smug attitude of “how hard can it be” – as if shadow work was a weekend project I could do with a cup of tea and a moody playlist. I had already lost the battle with the cosmos, so I figured it couldn’t hurt to dismantle myself a little longer. In fact, it was probably the best time to do it – my ego was already bruised up, and too weak to stand guard. I surrendered to the impulsive thought and started looking into it. You probably know the feeling: you start researching something online, and the deeper you go, the more confusing it gets. This was no exception. I ended up with more questions, and nothing seemed to give me enough to fully capture the essence of the concept. Everything felt too “basic”, like I couldn’t get to the real down-and-dirty core of it.  Regardless, I kept scratching this surface, because it was the first time I felt pulled towards something else than my dear Albert. And that felt good.   
  
One day, Albert and I had a nice 15 minute lunch before he had to run back to work. Like a loyal echo – I skipped drinking the rest of my coffee, and followed him. As I walked a few steps behind him – sulking and recasting his completely reasonable need to work as a personal rejection –  I felt a sudden veil entering my field. It was like I walked into a soft blanket.  This surprised me as I was so used to running into brick walls. But no, this felt gentle – although strong enough to make me stop walking. Since my subconscious armor of self-destruction had slightly cracked open, I was finally open to receive a tender whisper. Coincidently – or not – I had stopped right in front of a cute little shop I had been wanting to check out for a while. All of a sudden I get a glimpse of realization that I am my own person. I didn’t have to leave just because he left. Why did I leave? I was standing on the sidewalk, muttering to myself like a lunatic having a board meeting, as my brain was breaking free from whatever autopilot setting I’d been stuck on. For the first time I stopped following Albert’s path, and started walking my own.  At least for a hot minute.   
  
I entered this beautiful, vibrant shop – absorbing all the colors and the artsy objects. It was a very small step for humanity, but a pathetically huge step for me. Like a kid in a candy store – wide eyed and curious – I had to touch everything. I was beaming as I was led forward hand in hand with something far greater than me. I expressed my love for this place to the girl who worked there, and we started talking. After a little while she went over to the book shelf, and picked out a book that I personally think is way too big. She didn’t say much about the content, but recommended that I read it. Without looking at it I said “absolutely” and brought it home. Can you guess what the book was about? I was in complete shock as I was skimming through this massive thing. The search was over. Here I was, holding the book of answers to my questions. A 12 week program on how to drastically change your life, by facing the shadows that keep you stuck. I had to peel my jaw off the floor and sit down just to take it all in. After staring at the wall for a good twenty minutes, trying to process what had just happened, I started reading. This was it. This book was going to save my life from blowing up completely. I was so excited. I felt a spark light up inside me again – I was re-energized and convinced that everything was going to be okay now. Wouldn’t it be amazing if I could say that this changed everything for the better, and we lived happily ever after? Nope. This was just the very, very beginning. Remember me and my cursed nut from the Ice Age? Of course, I wasn’t done. Not even close. There was still plenty of mountain left to demolish beneath my own feet.   
  
I had been working with my shadow-book for a little while, and I was still so excited about the process. Even though Albert was very tired of my extreme ups and downs, he was very supportive and happy for me – until he wasn’t, of course. I started digging deeper and deeper, and I had a few realizations on the way. About both myself as well as other people. Things started to make sense, and it gave me hope. But here’s the twist – the more I felt like I was accessing the hidden parts of myself, gaining insight and becoming more aware of my patterns, the more my outer world collapsed. Strange, right? It was like one of those nightmares where you’re running toward a door and never getting closer. The faster you run, the further away it gets. I couldn’t understand why this was happening. Why did the process of me trying to improve myself just destroy everything around me? My friendships, my relationship to Albert, my family, my life – just slipping through my fingers. The irony was brutal: the deeper I dove into the dark night of my soul, the tighter its grip became. My words, my actions, my state of mind spun out of control – more than before. It was as if I’d stepped into a cold, perfect intelligence – programmed to push everything away, while I desperately tried to hold on. The confusing part was that I wasn’t just trapped inside it – I *was* it. I was both the cold intelligence and the desperate one. Probably not something you should put on your résumé. Anyway – it’s almost eerie how each chapter of the book was literally inviting more disasters into my life – like every paragraph was unleashing some kind of dark spell. In between the witchy gut punches, I was however overwhelmed by the loving signs and synchronicities from the universe. I had never felt more protected, guided and loved, by something I still don’t fully understand. There was an intense presence of a higher power surrounding me, still holding my hand, as I was crossing a burning bridge behind me. The worse everything became, the stronger the presence. And every time I thought I had reached rock bottom, I felt a little pat on the back, and a gentle nudge telling me to keep going – don’t look back.   
  
To be honest, those weeks, even months, are kind of a blur. Everything unfolded so quickly. I was so eager to face my darkness, surrender to it, and determined to release it. What I didn’t realize was that, in doing so, I had also opened the door for Albert’s darkness to slip in too. It wasn’t just a crumbling of me and my life, it happened to him as well. The events that simultaneously  happened in his life were unbearable, excruciating – and of course had a very peculiar timing. As I saw everything dissolving around me, he had the same experiences. It naturally came to a point where he no longer could sacrifice himself for me. I don’t blame him, but back then – the beast in me convinced me this was the ultimate, grand betrayal. I could not comprehend how he could turn on me – not while I was doing the work to improve myself for us. I thought I was doing something for our relationship, and saw it as unfair that he would “check out” now. He constantly tried to tell me that if he does not take care of his life, we won’t make it. His words didn’t reach me – and mine didn’t reach him. We were mirroring each other perfectly, yet the wall between us had grown too high. We were too divided, too disconnected, to use that mirror to rebuild what we’d lost.   
  
We could no longer communicate – the misunderstandings, tension and frustration just kept growing. Conversations had turned into fights, laughter had turned into tears, and love had turned into resentment. To this day, I still remember how his eyes changed – how he looked at me like I was the monster under his bed, spoke to me like I was his worst enemy, and avoided me like a pest. Words cannot describe the pain I felt every single day – obviously, a feast my shadows devoured with delight. Once again, I thought I had reached a maximum threshold of pain. A level I didn’t believe was humanly possible to survive. That was until the day Albert left. We were flying home from a trip that was supposed to be good, with a few layovers on the way. On the last one, Albert stood up and walked off the plane – without any hesitation. He was done. The unshakable mountain finally split at its core, and collapsed.  As he walked away, my heart was ripped from my chest, dragged behind him by the invisible cord that tied me to him, leaving me hollow and shattered.

While ordering the female cook (like for fries, doing everything themselves) asked if we need a bag. We just nodded to each other and said no thank you. 

Then my roommate started elaborating that we just live around the corner, so it's very close and not necessary. I found this information a little unnecessary as the conversation kinda ended so I was a little surprised and actually found it quite funny to just elaborate even further, adding smth like ""oh yeah we could give our adress and room number and such, yk for some coffee haha"". This atleast to me seemed kinda funny as it's hella unreasonable since we don't know that person working there if you guys get what I mean. Additionally, I said it to my roommate and not the worker in a playful/funny and ironic tone.
Then my roommate said that this exchange was uncomfortable and I asked her to explain since I didn't get why. Summing up and paraphrasing, she said smth like ""ah typical man"" (not deragetory tho) and then shared stories of how when asked all the men after the local folks fest do not recount cases of sexual harrassment and when women are asked they all say ""yeah my friend and here and more"". That this situation in any way resembled that confused me so I asked if to her my comments created such an impression/undertone (sexually). She stayed quiet, kinda confirming what I said basically. Although she was very light hearted with everything the whole time and didn't bring it up afterwards.

So right now I feel somewhat mistrusted, falesely accused and or put into a group of people I do my best to be against (sexual predators/harassers). I do kinda get how my joke could be understood that way as inviting a woman for coffee is (often) typical for dating tho I genuienely don't think that's likely as I wasn't even talking to the staff. I also apologized and asked the staff if she felt uncomfortable, but she actually didn't listen and said I don't need to worry about it. Idk I just wish my roommate would have explained more as it can happen that I am just unaware that something can make someone else uncomfortable tho I didn't get an explanation or stepped aside to point it out, just compared/lumped in with obvious sexual harrassment and idk how te feel about it (and about how I feel lol). 

Any opinion would be helpful, just please be polite in the comments. If I am overreacting or in the wrong I am open to explanations, I am more lost than anything.",1,1760291532.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

My type of woman is someone who is emotionally intelligent, chatty, empathetic and can communicate well.
Prefer someone who is working, and can manage their own expenses. It doesn't mean you won't receive the occasional surprises but I want to ensure that you are someone who is financially stable enough to survive on your own. Also I prefer someone who is into fitness, if not already, then plan to be. We could be workout partners and hype each other up and grow together :) 

We could go out together, try out different variety of food, taste coffee, watch movies, travel to different places, and try out new things and experiences. 

I could say a lot of fancy things to attract you, but I would rather not do that and over commit giving you false hope. I would rather build a relationship with a strong foundation based on understanding and the person who you are. Loyalty and trust is important to me.

My entire world is usually a simple equation: find blood, avoid the clap. Last night, however, I hitched a ride that fundamentally changed my understanding of volume and chaos.

I was resting comfortably on the rear-view mirror of the little white Indrive car. The driver—a polite-looking MBA student—was focused, checking his phone. It was quiet. Serene. I was contemplating a snack when five passengers climbed in.

The moment the car pulled away from Coffee Bean near Lake City, the environment changed from ""library"" to ""concert .""

The air in the car thickened with ""chaotic energy"" and then shattered into sound. The humans began producing a high-pitched, vibrating wail—a full-throated performance of ""Sabko Sab Nahi Milta"" The volume was so intense that my antennae, which usually sense the most delicate vibrations, were completely overloaded. I had to brace myself against the glass to avoid being flung into the air.
I watched the driver. He didn't move. He became a stone statue of professional resignation. He was driving through DHA Phase 5, experiencing a spiritual journey not of peace, but of sonic endurance. His eyes were wide, and I swear, I saw a single tear well up, though it might have just been the reflection of a streetlight.

The passengers were singing at the top of their lungs, entirely unaware of the effect they were having on the ecosystem—both the driver and me. The car was vibrating with so much sound that it was impossible to focus on finding a vein. Survival became the priority.
When they finally arrived and the humans departed, the sudden silence was so immense it felt like the whole world had stopped spinning. The driver sat there for a long moment, breathing slowly, staring into the dark.

I flew off his mirror and landed on the steering wheel, trying to recover. I didn't get any blood, but I got a story. Next time, I think I'll hitch a ride on a rickshaw. It's much quieter.",2,1760291486.0,IslamabadSocial,1,0.67,False

•	⁠Share cool dad-friendly spots around the Nashville area (parks, hikes, breweries, kid-friendly coffee shops).
•	⁠Ask questions, trade advice, or just vent about dad life.

I’ll kick things off soon with a few meetups and giveaways, but for now — introduce yourself below.

•	⁠Where in the Nashville area are you from?
•	⁠How many kids and what ages?
•	⁠What kind of dad hangout sounds like your thing (beer night, hiking, BBQ, whatever)?

Even though that could’ve been a fun little plot twist – unfortunately, it’s just the natural result of me aiming for romance and landing in restraining order territory. Anyway. The day my very own “Mr. Big” came into my life wasn’t really that big of a deal. Yes, it was cool to meet this lovely guy – and his best friend (who I thought was his boyfriend), who had traveled all the way from across the world. They were just casually vacationing in my home town, and coincidently walking into the gym at the same time me and my friends were there. Even though the conversation was short, we made a surprising amount of plans together. So it felt completely reasonable to swap numbers with these two strangers we met 10 minutes ago. We agreed to travel to the other side of the world next summer to visit them, and they would come back in a couple of months. To be real, it didn’t feel more than those moments when you meet an acquaintance on the street and throw out the mandatory “let’s get a coffee sometime”. They left, and that was it. We were definitely never meeting them again. As the days slipped past, the uneventful meet slowly faded into the abyss – but like a bad cologne, there was still a lingering memory about his eyes that never really went away.   
  
Days, weeks, months went by – and guess who came back. He actually meant it when he said he would come back.  Just imagine – how do you even react to that? Is it giving romance, or is it giving psychopath? But there he was. Just an innocent man unaware of his part of some  cosmic-level nonsense. We all went out together, and circumstances only allowed this to be a one time event. During the night, we sat next to each other and started talking. I told him about my life, my boyfriend and about our plans to take the next step. I wasn’t sure who I was trying to convince – him or myself. But he was not buying it.  His eyes were just piercing through the bullshit that even I wasn’t aware of. I felt naked. He saw me, behind the mask I didn’t know I was wearing. He asked questions and challenged my thoughts in a way nobody had ever done before. You get the picture, you’ve heard these stories before. I’ll say it as it is, it was fucking magnetic. After this night, the silence and the peace I had felt the past few months was gone. As I was walking home I could feel some type of force entering my body, everything I thought I knew was crumbling, the lies I had kept telling myself were surfacing, the silenced voices in my head were now louder than ever, and the fog that had felt like a veil of safety was gone – everything became clear. And when I realized what I had to do next…gosh. Remember that scene from Twilight when Edward saw Bella walking into the classroom? And you can’t quite tell if  he’s reacting to inhaling a moth or experiencing acute diarrhea? …felt like something like that.  
  
The thing is – there are so many details, feelings, chaos and magic in this epic love story that definitely can trigger your gag reflex. As I am writing this, I have to keep reminding myself that this part isn’t really the point. It was never the point. So I have to keep it short, and fast forward a year – I broke up with my boyfriend, sold the house, the car, left my job – and moved across the world to be with this man. This left many people confused, and it’s safe to say that my family were probably regretting their choices of not having me tested as a kid. As for me and my Mr. Big – we were just happily unaware of our path into the most intense, divine shitstorm that was about to rip our souls into galactic stardust. While we were too busy falling in love – the universe was sharpening its teeth, and our guides preparing the snacks for this cosmic apocalypse. Here we go.",1,1760291362.0,u_EthericMinds,0,1.0,False

1o4vnnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1o4vnnd/i_met_the_love_of_my_life_through_an_affair_and/,I met the love of my life through an affair and was too afraid to blow up my life.,"By all appearances I have a good life - a great job that I secured through a college education, married my high school sweetheart, a few wonderful kids, an idyllic home in a wholesome community.

Somewhere along the way my wife and I drifted apart. She cheated on me once when we were first married, and we worked very hard to get past that. Couples counseling was important and it helped that I'm someone who is very easy to forgive. A feckless people pleaser to some extent.  We made it through the other side and made a life together. I forgave her but in retrospect I don't think I ever fully recovered and don't think I ever will. 

I blamed myself for playing a part in her cheating on me. I was distant and lacked emotional intelligence during a very difficult time in her life. I didn't actively do anything to hurt her, but my generally passive and stoic nature made it hard for her to confide in me. So, I positioned our lives so I could provide everything possible to make her happy. I became an avid runner, got in shape, learned how to dress myself, and had a moderate glow up as we transitioned to the part of our lives where we had kids. I excelled in my career and proudly marched my way to the fiscal purgatory of the middle class. Got us new cars, a house, all the creature comforts a millennial family could want. 

Things seemed fine, partially because I was always so hyper focused on succeeding. Completing every mission I laid out for myself. That included making sure my marriage didn't fail. 

Then at work, I made a friend. She was married too, had a kid around the same age as mine, and we hung out with the same circle of friends. One day she missed out on a lunch with our other friends, so I invited her to lunch on my own. Things started out harmless, more DMs at work, texting occasionally outside of work. Then the chats became more suggestive, more personal. She confided in me how unhappy she was in her marriage. Her husband did nothing - she felt helpless in a life she created but didn't want. I genuinely didn't think her feelings were as strong as they were until she kissed me. We had a short fling, one that confused me because up until then I considered myself happy. I had achieved so many things I had set out for myself to do, so why would I do something so reckless and emotional?

My friend gave me an ultimatum - either blow up my life for her or I couldn't be a part of it anymore. I knew I wasn't going to ever blow up my life for her. I asked myself if it was because I didn't feel that strongly for her, or if it was because I'd never be able to do something like that to my family. 

I suppose that was the driving force for me to actively seek out an affair here, on reddit. Was I now someone who had affairs? Was I that the kind of person I was, or was this a fluke situation with a friend IRL that I just had to experience and move on?

I browsed the appropriate subreddits and eventually made an ad. I got a surprising amount of messages, some of which were thoughtful enough to warrant a response. But nothing really materialized. I was going through a life-or-death family medical emergency and was just about to give up on finding someone when she reached out to me. 

I got a message from a woman bold enough to open the dialogue with pictures. She was so beautiful I legitimately thought I was getting catfished. I left the messages on read for a day before deciding to answer. 

We started talking on a separate app and immediately hit it off. We exchanged messages for hours. We connected so deeply and so quickly. We agreed to meet right away in person. It was supposed to just be a quick coffee date. A meet-and-greet. What followed was the most intense, loving relationship I've ever had. We talked every day for hours. I started every day by texting her good morning and ended it by texting her goodnight. My every thought was consumed by her and how perfect we felt together. I opened up to her in ways I never did with my wife, any of my friends, anyone else in my life I had ever encountered. 

She was perfect to me. An infectious smile, deeply blue eyes full of warmth, addictively soft lips. A kind soul, cut from the same cloth - a people pleaser, but one who knew how to emotionally connect with people. We had incredible, mind-blowing sex that I still think about every day. 

She had her reasons for seeking an affair. I understood and sympathized. We fantasized about being together one day. I never felt that way with the friend I previously was intimate with. It never felt real, not like this. It genuinely felt like I found my person.

I had no plan. It was easy to think we could just do that for years and years, until we both worked up the gumption to change our situations. I had no intention of leaving my wife, but I found myself actively thinking about all the different circumstances in which I could somehow be with my newfound soulmate. We saw each other multiple times a week. Spent trips overnight together. We were genuinely and truly happy together. Every moment apart felt like the space between the actual story of our lives. 

My wife had been struggling with alcohol for years. She would go on benders, and it got progressively worse after COVID. Whether or not my affair actually contributed to it worsening further, it did start to become untenable and I eventually blamed myself when she became a danger to me and those around her. Drinking and driving. Binge drinking during the day and passing out before noon. Not attending our kids activities because she blacked out. 

It became too much. I tried not to put it on my shoulders, but I knew eventually I would. I had a hard time facing it head on. This confident handle I had on my life started to crumble slowly. It got to the point where I thought the only way to fix my life was to let go of the only person who really knew me and understood me. 

Our relationship wasn't perfect. We both made our mistakes. But she was perfect for me. Every inch of her, inside and out, every word she spoke, every sound she made, every heavy breath she took when we held each other - she was made just for me. 

No one in my situation deserves pity, let alone sympathy. I'll make my life work. I always do. I've never had regrets in my life, not substantive ones anyway. Until now. Not just for myself, thinking about what could have been. But for her, what I put her through, the pain I caused her. And the fact that if I never came into her life, she probably would have already run off with someone else and started building herself a better life. Any other sane man in my situation would have. I know I'll think about her every day for the rest of my life. Some part of me thinks the universe will construct some way for us to cross paths again, as unlikely as it was that we ever met in the first place. That's part of what keeps me going, even if I know deep down it's just a construct in my head. But I will always wonder what could have been. And wish I was with her.  

Sometimes I think I'm a sociopath, and that all of my relationships are a reflection of that. Or I say that to myself as a rationalization for what I've done and the decision to carry all that scar tissue all alone. When I'm old and gray, I wonder what I'll think of myself. And if I ever will forgive myself as easily as I've forgiven everyone around me. 

I just know no matter what happens, I won't deserve that forgiveness. From me, or anyone else.",2,1760291334.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

In this, they go to Far Far Away, where Princess Fiona was born. This is a comedy movie, so they put Far Far Away up like the Hollywood sign (in the picture).

Ella (blue) is on an escalator in a mall. The camera pans out to show you that the escalator is being operated by two men turning a crank (brown and red in the bottom left of the photo). This is an example of a rube goldberg-esque way to include modern tech despite the implausibility.



High fantasy is a completely separate world.

Low fantasy is a world hidden within our own.

This means that this is high fantasy. Mid-fantasy isn't right, because this is a completely separate world... but there's to much modernity to not have its own sub category, right?

Only LTR people.,"There' this girl, she sent me  proposal letter with her no. few days ago. And I liked it . I didn't know her before. Proposal was anonymous only with her no.


We started having conversation on call and chats and she seems nice girl  upto  this day 

In last two days, I have asked her many times to meet in person  but she doesn't seem to be interested in meeting.

You would think , may be she lives far or any family problem , nothing man

She lives in a same PG on same floor but she  never ever invited me to her room. ( Co living pg)

Even I have invited her to my room a lot of times but she seems to avoid it.

I thought may be she's not comfortable meeting here in the pg.

So i invited her to meet at nearby coffee shop but no she's uinterested

During one of the conversation happened in last two days..
She said she would like to go on a night ride without any destination 

Few hourse ago ,she was sitting on common balcony, so i invited her for a ride. This is the first time me meeting her after her proposal.

I offered her for a ride, again she started making excuses, like raat bohot hogyi h, sab band hogya hoga, it was 10 pm and she herself go for a coffee till 11pm.

And yaha 10 bje sab band nahi hota h. 

She calls me , chats with me but  do not feel encouraged to meet in person

Shes on periods rn. That s the reason she told me after asking 5-6 times but man we live in a same PG , same floor. 

She's ok to travel on rapido to meet her friends , she ok to go for work  but not meet me 😭 😭 😭 

Sabse badi baat, when I asked her for a ride . She doesn't even bothered to look at me.  She doesn't even shown any kind of excitement. 

Dull face. Kept scrolling on phone without looking at me. 

aisa lga I am criminal and koi interrogation chal raha h 

Itni negative energy kaise ho sakti h yr.

Phone pe to bohot sahi baat krti h ..

First time in person mila hu...or itna khrab experience h ..

Aage baat krne k bhi man nhi kr raha 


Please help .isko kya samjhu mein .

Should I keep pushing efforts?

Please advice jo long term  relationship m hai .ya rahe h .

The other night he stayed at his work until 2 in the morning (even though the place closes at 10), drinking, without letting my friend know that he’s there or who he’s with. 
When she woke up and texted him where he was he said he forgot to tell her, came home and was very cold, and continued to tell her he doesn’t know if he wants this anymore. 
The next day when she was at work he packed all his thing and left. 
They talked that evening, he said he can’t open up or talk about his feelings and can’t change so that’s why the relationship won’t work. 
This morning me and my partner were having a coffee on the balcony and saw him running his usual route, only this time with a blonde pretty girl. 
I follow him on strava so I could see who it was with and it’s a girl from his work. 
It all feels super fishy to me, and he’s blaming this whole breakup on my friend and she’s not doing well. 
Tomorrow I see her for a girls night, should I tell her? So she can bring it up with him? Or should I stay out of it.

Recently he went off to college around a month ago and is going to college on the other side of the country. He will be home for Christmas break but I miss him a lot.

I met his parents pretty early on in our relationship. And we became official soon after. He has two brothers, one of whom is in high school with me.

Over the summer I was at his house pretty much every day, so I saw and interacted with his parents. I’ve gotten invited to dinner with them twice, which both times I’ve gone to. I went on a trip with my boyfriend and them.

I know they like me, his mom always wants me to chat with her and takes every opportunity to do so lol. The day he left she made me an iced tea and told me I could come over anytime 😭.

Even though my boyfriend has reassured me that his family loves me I still feel awkward asking his mom if she wants to get coffee with me after work sometime. Like idk if I’m overstepping or not.

I haven’t talked to any of them since yesterday when I dropped off some of my homage rice crispy treats. But I’m just scared of it being awkward.

I asked her just yesterday if she wanted to get a coffee and she said sure and she brought everyone in the family. His brothers looked bored af, didn’t really talk to me. But his parents seemed happy enough to see me. They sat down and talked to me for around 30-40 minutes. And laughed at some of my jokes and asked me questions about my plans in life. At the end his mom said it was great seeing me. Then I sent a text apologizing for being awkward and boring his younger brothers, and she told me not to worry and that I was funny, that she had a good time and good luck with my new job.

They had just left a place called Coffee Bean, full of caffeine, warmth, and plans that probably won’t all come true. Yet in that moment, they had everything: youth, freedom, friendship, and me — echoing softly through the car.

 My nervous system is still super wired, my caffeine sensitivity is through the roof, and the tension in my body makes it feel like I’m constantly on edge. I definitely started drinking coffee again way too early and I have learned my lesson lol (I hope)

I’ve been fighting anxiety and hyper-vigilance for a long time, and it’s popping up in every moment. 


It’s kind of intimidating when I think about how long I have trained myself to look for quick “relief”, but I’m trying to let my body do its work and let my system reset properly. 

It’s uncomfortable, but I try to keep reminding myself that this is part of the process.

I’m trying to be patient with myself, cut back on caffeine, and give my sleep schedule some attention. 

It’s not perfect, and I still have moments where I feel like I’m losing control.

But just making it through a day without reaching for nicotine is huge.

It’s a slow path, but I know on some level the payoff is worth it. 


Real relief isn’t instant, and real healing comes from letting my body and mind adjust at their own pace. I just wanted to say that out loud, and hopefully it helps someone else who’s in the thick of it too.

I’ve been into puzzling lately and realized it would be nice to meet others who enjoy it too. Maybe swap puzzles, share techniques, or just relax over coffee while solving one together.

Right now, I’m just **testing the waters** to see if there’s interest. If enough people are into it, I’d love to try organizing a **small casual meetup** (nothing formal yet, just a chill get-together in a café or co-working space).

If that sounds like something you’d join, comment below or DM me so I can get a sense of how many fellow puzzle lovers are out there 

Who knows... this could grow into a regular thing if people enjoy it!

We were kids and I was really childish. I mean I was 16 and I was just thinking, he is so cute and I want to hold his hand. I was horribly naive. Started out very sweet and innocent, ended horribly. He was verbally and physically abusive a few times and then he r*ped me. We never spoke again after that. I’d avoid him and hide if I saw him and he never tried to find me or talk to me. Very short lived traumatizing nightmare of a relationship. It just got horrible very fast. I think we dated for 2 or 3 months but I knew him for a few years. I never told my parents or anyone what happened until I started therapy. 

I recently got a random text from him. He apologized for everything and said he was heavily abused at home and m*lested as a child and it all screwed him up. He became an alcoholic and is in recovery now and currently trying to stay sober. And I didn’t deserve any of it. He said I was kind and full of light and it made him jealous in a way because he was so messed up. And he never talked to me again because he was ashamed and scared and embarrassed. He said he hoped I was okay and he thinks about me a lot and I’m the sweetest person he ever knew and our relationship was the biggest mistake of his life. 

To be honest, I felt sorry for him because of his abuse and we were kids. So I told him that I hope he can work through his trauma and addiction and I forgive him. He said thanks and asked if I could get coffee with him one day and I just said maybe. 

I myself went to therapy and started working out to build some strength and confidence. I’m not the same person for sure but I worked through it. 

I was thinking about all this and remembered everything and my boyfriend caught me crying so I told him everything and showed him the texts. He comforted me and I felt a lot better and he told me to please not get coffee with this person. I said okay and then he brought up reporting him to the police. And I told him it was years ago and he apologized and he said I still should. He was really pushing it. He offered to do it with me and said it has to happen because at least there will be some sort of record or history if he does it again. I don’t know if it’s necessary or if I want to. He texted me today again asking when I’ll be free to go together. I don’t know what to do. I told him that he’s in recovery and I don’t want to make him relapse and maybe we should move on. He said I have to stop seeing the best in people.

I'm playing a Kethek, Crucible Goliath Brawl deck focused on stealing my opponents creatures to sac to him. My opponent is playing Flubs the Fool, and their turns last longer than some entire games I've played. 

Now, this is fine with me, because I'm watching youtube and sipping my morning coffee while I watch them play card after card after card, chucking things in their graveyard, and play lots of mana ramp and small little creatures. 

Then their deck starts getting really low... and I'm thinking to myself ""Surely, they have a bomb or something here, right? Or some way to shuffle their graveyard back into their deck and keep going for some sort of payoff?""

Nope. They just keep going and going and going and eventually... Run out of cards. One last spell triggers Flubs, there's nothing left to draw and... I win. 

So now I'm wondering... Does this deck actually have a win con or did they just.... not play it well? Best I could see as bombs was Hangarback Walker and a Stonecoil Serpent but even then they had no way to stop the most basic removal.

Many of my siblings have disability’s and standing for Divine Liturgy isn’t exactly an option for my family. I’ve been in a loving God centered relationship with a girl from my previous church who has grown in the fairly Protestant world view just as I had but she has been very clear that it is my duty as a boyfriend and perhaps future husband to lead her in her faith and I am being led to the Orthodox Church I have thus fear that she won’t convert. Her father is a pastor at the Nondenominational church. It will be a huge thing for both of us and our lives. The things we indulge in, and the music we listen to. This is all good but I have practically made up my mind on the matter but I’m in this season of waiting for her to get out of college so we can attend together.

We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more career wise and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. Just back on the position I was in. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

It’s very much an **MVP** but we are still improving things and adding extra features.

“We’ll figure something out,” I said.

“We won’t.”

“I can handcuff you or tie you up. The road might still think it’s against your will. We could trick it.”

“That won’t work,” Autumn said. We were still in the cab of my truck after learning how lane-locked drivers could escape Route 333 from the pregnant hitchhiker woman (from her newborn baby, technically).

“What if we―”

“Stop!” She slammed a fist against the dashboard. The hanging air freshener shuddered. “You can’t fix everything! It’s not your responsibility.”

“But we’ll figure this out.”

“There is no *we.* You barely even know me. It’s too late. I give up.”

“But―”

“How long do you think until the road takes you out, huh? You *know* now. It can't be happy about that. Go save the others while there's time.”

“I'm not leaving―”

“STOP!”

She clambered over the black, amniotic birthing fluid, puddled on the passenger seat and leapt from my rig.

“What are you doing?” I called.

She didn’t respond. She marched the opposite direction.

“Let me at least give you a ride,” I said. Autumn didn’t slow. “Where are you going? I can get you there safely. Autumn―”

“Leave me alone!” she screamed. “It’s only a few miles. I’m walking home by myself.”

Not to *town* or to *my apartment.* She’d accepted the town she’d been staying in as *home*. The place she now and would always live, like how Tiff had found a diner and settled down.

Autumn was giving up.

She was right. I couldn’t fix everything. I couldn’t even fix my *own* problems, and now, I’d gone and ruined her life too. By involving her in my plan, I’d taken away any chance she had of escaping Route 333. I couldn’t fix everything.

I could fix one thing.

It was the same destructive frenzy that had entered me before I’d assaulted Randall. There was no reasoning. There was no calming down and second guessing. There was only the single-minded obsessiveness that would consume me until I accomplished what I had to. I knew the secret. Route 333 had warned me once what would happen if I tried to interfere. 

I got the sense it wouldn't bother with a second. 

“What are you doing?” Randall approached me at the truck yard. His nose cast was finally gone, but there was a distinct *askewness* to his face now.

“Hooking up an empty trailer.” I crawled out from where I’d finished making sure the jaws were locked.

“Over my dead body.”

“Easily arranged.”

“You’re already deep in overtime,” Randall insisted. “We’re not financing the entirety of your starter home. Didn’t Deidree already try this?” When I ignored him, he continued. “Look, Brendon, you’re not doing anything for Chris by setting off on a fool’s errand. He’s only a year out. We’ll even keep him on as an employee. This―”

“I’m not going for Chris.”

“No?”

“Not yet, at least. Not first. I’m going for Tiff.”

“How many times have we discussed this? You’re not―”

“I know how to save her.”

His mouth, no joke, *fell* open. Apparently, that’s a thing that does happen in real life. “How―what―how do you know?”

“No time. The road knows I know. I need to go for her before it decides to take the two of us out, but if I don't make it back, radio Autumn. She can explain more to you.”

“So you *have* met that girl. Regardless, you can't just barrel into this like always. Management is already screaming at me because of you. Calm down. Let's talk about a strategy.”

I jabbed him in the chest with a finger. “You never really tried to help Tiff, did you? That was a lie. Just like everything else. You say you want to help us to make yourself feel better, but you never have. For once in your miserable life, admit the truth, Randall: you don’t care about us. You never will.”

His face flashed through a dozen emotions: confusion, anger, hurt, grief, etc. “Of course, I do.”

“Then let me go.”

He stood there. He jabbed me in my own chest. “Don't you dare make me hire your replacement. I'm busy as it is.” Then he nodded once.

I left.

Dear readers. If you were hoping for something a bit more cathartic in Randall’s and my relationship, then it’s my displeasure to inform you that’s all you’re going to get. There will be no enemies-to-BFFs story arc. No tear-jerking *he-sacrifices-his-life-for-me* or *I-take-a-bullet-for-him.* 

I don’t especially like Randall. I doubt he likes me. Likely, neither of those opinions will ever change, but turning out of the parking lot that day, there was at least something akin to *respect* between us. 

He had his job. He was good at it.

I had mine.

For lack of a better term, my mom and dad were helicopter parents.

I haven’t talked much about them. There isn’t some deep, dark backstory surrounding my childhood or anything. It simply hasn’t been relevant to my time on Route 333 until now. 

In elementary school I played soccer. My dad attended every game. On one particular Saturday morning, he stormed on the field and screamed in the referee’s face, spit flying, for yellow-carding me.

Guess who got a red card?

In fifth grade, Garrett invited me to his birthday party at the bowling alley. Parents weren’t invited. We were eleven, after all, but my Mom insisted on accompanying me anyway to make sure nothing got out of hand. She sat right at my side, between me and the other boys. When it was my time to bowl, she shouted pointers and cheered when I knocked over a single pin.

I never got an invite to Garrett’s next birthday party.

I could go on. Dentist appointments, friend issues, first dates, high school football games―there was virtually no aspect of my life they didn’t investigate, advise, or meddle in.

Don’t get me wrong. They were good parents, *great* parents even, but by the time I ever so much as mentioned the possibility of detention, they’d already contacted my teacher, the principal, and the school board for separate, outraged meetings. Very rarely did their intervention ever actually *help*. Mainly, all it taught me was that there would always be somebody else to solve my problems for me.

I won’t claim it’s their fault I’m the way I am: unable to handle life unless something with teeth is chasing me forward. I’ve seen crappy parents end up with all-star kids and vice versa. Each of us has a nature and a potential, and a moment (or a dozen) when we decide to fulfill or not to fulfill that potential. It would, however, be dishonest to say they didn’t *influence* who I am. I never quite had the chance to learn to swim before I was being thrown in front of a wave.

All of that to say this: sometimes, it's the things we do to protect people that end up hurting them.

Isn’t that what I’d done with Autumn? I’d wanted to save her. I’d tried to give her a chance, but instead, I’d taken that very chance away.

Was that what I was doing with Tiff? Would my helping her hurt her? It was possible, *likely* even, but what else was I supposed to do? At what point did aid turn into overbearing and help turn into obsession? 

That was the truth of it, I suspected. My parents. They’d loved me, but their vulture-like circling had never been about me, not entirely. It had been about their need to fix. To feel they were *good* parents doing the *right* thing for their child. Was that me? Was I the vulture? 

There were too many sides to every equation. For years, I’d been unable to tell what I should do and how I should do it. It had crippled me, knocked me over at the knees. All I did know was that I had to do *something*. If that thing wasn’t helping somebody… then what?

“Brendon?” Tiff said as I entered her red and white diner. She was wiping crumbs off one of the tables. “Could’ve sworn Deidree told me she saw you headed to dispatch.”

“Do you miss it?”

“Huh?”

“Do you wish you could go back?”

She paused mid-swipe. “Brendon, if something’s up, I’m always free to talk. You know that.” 

“No. This isn’t about me. I don’t want it to be. Tiff, I just need to know if, well, you miss it. The *real* world. Life, people, all of it. Do you wish you could go back? Would you risk your life to get there?”

Her eyebrows crinkled. She clasped her hands and the tattoos along her forearms flexed. “I’ve built something for myself here. When I got stuck, I imagine nobody in the real world asked about me much. That’s the curse of a life on a road. You’re gone so often, people tend to forget you. Relationships fade. The only person I’ve ever cared about is my daughter. If I could be with her, I’d go wherever.”

Her daughter. The one who’d passed away from cancer. Tiff rarely talked about her, but I knew it was the reason she’d started hauling on Route 333.

“I don’t mean to be insensitive,” I started, “but you can’t be with her.”

“Don’t reckon I can.”

“So you wouldn’t risk it?” My stomach unclenched. “If you had the choice? You’d stay here.”

She stared at me. She looked up at a burnt out light fixture, at the employee smiling unnaturally behind the cash register, at the fake family laughing in a corner booth. She blew out of her mouth. 

Her face grew gravely dark. “What sane person would stay?”

I nodded.

“Don’t you go doing something stupid,” she said.

I snorted and plopped myself onto a table, swinging my legs off the edge. “If only I could.”

We talked for a while. She brought me some pie. We shared a pot of the only good coffee on Route 333. It wasn’t until evening was setting in and the automatic outside lights had switched on that I said, “can I get you to check on something with me?”

“What’s that?”

I led her to the back of my truck and rolled up the trailer. She peered in. “There’s nothing in there, is there?”

“Nothing dangerous, nah. It’s…well…it’s kind of hard to explain. Can you just go check on it?”

She shrugged, climbed in, and sauntered to the back. “What were you asking about? I don’t see anything.”

I slammed the door closed.

“Brendon?” Her voice was quiet at first, inquisitive. The doors trembled, but I’d already snapped closed the padlock. “You let me out.”

“No can do.”

“This isn’t funny.”

“It’s not,” I agreed.

The banging came soon after. Then hollering. Controlled at first but increasingly more frantic. “*Brendon*!” A piece of me drooped, withered, and flaked to dust.

*It’s for your own good,* I wanted to stay, but that would be too dangerous. I couldn’t risk Tiff thinking I was doing this to help her. No more chances. I’d already wasted them on Autumn. Tiff had admitted herself she would risk her life if it meant a chance at getting home.

In the distance, clouds were rolling in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Within minutes I knew the pregnant hitchhiker woman had been telling the truth. Nothing about the desert we sailed through was new. Each landmark was familiar. Tiff now counted as unwilling cargo, and we were no longer lane-locked.

The realization should have thrilled me. This was the thing I’d fought for weeks and weeks for. My time on Route 333 hadn't been wasted.

Instead, I glanced in my rearview window periodically at the rumbling clouds growing both closer and less visible in the deepening twilight. It had been bad with the crying thing in my trailer that made other inhabitants more restless. Now Route 333 would be against me as well. 

By the time the first drops of blood hit my windshield, I knew it was too late. The road had no intention of letting me leave.

The blood turned chunkier, splatters instead of drops. I drove on. That had been my promise, hadn't it? Whatever happened, as long as there was someone to protect, I would keep my foot on the pedal.

Overhead thunder rumbled. My headlights filled with red. The asphalt was barely visible. We jostled and shuddered over debris raining onto the highway.

“Hold on!” I screamed to no one in particular. Tiff couldn’t hear me. She was alone, afraid, imprisoned in the back.

*You will not die there.*

Desert morphed into redwoods. It was a good thing Deidree had been the one to transport Chris. Otherwise, I’d have an extra hour of driving. As it was, we still had a chance.

Except we didn’t. 

Organs and ligaments were raining down now. The front window cracked and splintered in two separate places. My very cab groaned in the same way I imagined Autumn’s had. Any second and the whole thing would collapse inwards

*You will not die like this. I will not let you.*

I rolled down the windows and let loose a bellow. “You have no right! I broke none of your rules!” The storm continued to rage. “*How dare you!*”

The debris stopped falling.

The raining ceased.

My rig broke from a clear line of gruesome destruction into a fresh, untouched stretch of forest.

It had worked. My screaming had convinced the road to let us go―or so I thought. For one, glorious, relief-studded moment I truly believed Route 333 had really decided to allow us free.

Then my engine cut off. My rig slowed and stopped. My stomach joined my feet on the floor.

Route 333 hadn't let us go at all. It had merely acknowledged that for the next minute and forty-seven seconds, something *else* had claim to us first\*.\*

Since the incident with the thing in the trailer, the forest-dwellers had left me alone. They hadn't tried to speak to me or even so much as stop my truck. It was unusual; that’s what the other truckers said. All of them still experienced the same minute forty-seven slow down as they had for years. It was almost like the forest-dwellers were *embarrassed* by their last failed attempt.

They weren’t embarrassed now.

They didn’t even wait for the end of the time limit to skitter around the truck, looking for a way in. I didn’t bother hiding. What was the point? We’d spoken before. They had my scent. They *knew* I was here. Whatever happened was inevitable.

My time on the road had begun with another interviewee skewered to the roof of his vehicle. Every haul I’d made, I’d passed through here, the forest-dwellers domain. All of it, every drive, and swerve, and twist of the ignition key, had all been leading to this last confrontation.

After what seemed hours, but was probably minutes, the pattering slowed. My eyes remained firmly shut. Something low and gravely spoke from what sounded like directly on my hood. Like last time it was no voice, not truly. It was the rumble of gravel under tires, of sand sprinkled onto paper, and wings fluttering against an air current.

“Let us speak.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Alright then.”

“You will not pass this time. You know this. There is no option of escape, He Who Dwells on Stone.”

“Nah. I don’t reckon there is.”

“Once more, we demand you relinquish the life force you carry.”

“So you can trade it to the road?” I asked. “You want to get out of here the easy way, yeah? To go terrorize people in my world instead of here. Why do you all want to go there so bad? That’s what I don’t get. Do you eat us or something? Why not forge a new life for yourself here?  Why are all of you so obsessed with escaping?”

Silence.

My eyes were closed. I had no idea what was flashing across the forest-dwellers expression (if it even had a face), but I imagined conflict.

“Why are you?” it finally asked.

I found I had no good answer either.

“*Please*,” the forest-dweller said. “We have been trapped for so many turnings of this planet. We have no grievance with you. You have never gazed upon us. Relinquish her and we will have no cause to harm you or the remaining of your kind.”

“And what happens if I don’t? What if I refuse?”

“We will take her anyways.”

Outside the cab, a branch snapped in the distance. A breeze rustled the trees as if in slow ponderous consideration.

“Then you’d better do it,” I said.

“Very well.”

All at once, the slap of bare feet began once more. From all directions muttering rose up like the thing on my hood, but once more, none of them were voices. They were crackling, burning leaves and boulders crashing down mountains. They were the whisper of snow and the roar of avalanches. The sounds were everything and nothing all at once, from every direction and from nowhere, inescapable and non-existent.

The cracks in my windshield splintered. The whole thing crashed inwards. Wispy hands surrounded me, unfastened my seatbelt, and dragged me out through the windshield. Glass slashed my arms and cut into my bare calves. I screamed out.

The forces pushed me against my hood. My back arced against the curve. I tried to yank my arms and legs free, but like the hitchhikers, they were too strong. I had no chance. I never had. I was human. These impossibilities were something else entirely. 

An eyeless face flashed through my mind. A man, mouth gaping, with an entire tree trunk rammed through his chest. The pain on his face. The terror.

“We did not wish to hurt you,” the world whispered from every direction at once. “You have made this necessary.”

There was the snap of something from the side of the road, like a thick branch being yanked from its tree. I had perhaps seconds now. After everything―traversing the road, confronting Randall, learning the solution―this was where it all ended. The injustice of it all coursed through me, and I committed my one, final act of defiance.

I opened my eyes.

Above me hovered… well, *nothing.*

Not exactly. The forest-dwellers *were* there. Clear as the clouds in the sky. They stared at me from every direction, full of eyes and snapping jaws, but they were also *not* there. 

How do I explain this?

Imagine a mirage. At a glance, you clearly see the oasis. It’s so obvious, and yet, you know it’s not there. It doesn’t exist, and yet it does―except, even that's not a good example for the forest-dwellers, because a mirage is still something that’s possible and explainable. The forest-dwellers simply weren’t. They were a paradox that would drive you mad. An *impossibility*. 

Already, my mind was slipping. If we’d been in the real world, it would already be dripping out through my nose but something about the road helped me handle it. Either way, it didn’t matter. They were still going to kill me, these things that weren’t there.

But how could something hurt you if it wasn’t there?

“You don’t exist,” I whispered. And then louder, “You don’t exist.”

“We do.”

“You don’t.”

They flickered. Their tenuous state of being wavered.

“You exist as much as I believe you do, and I don’t. You can’t do anything to me.”

The world around me shuddered. The truck lurched side to side. *We exist,* they seemed to scream. Their every action was another subtle cue to convince me we inhabited the same physical realm. *We are here, and we will hurt you. We have wants. We are alive. Believe in us.*

I laughed. The force pushing me down lessened.

“You’re my late night fears,” I said. “You’re my loneliness, and the terrible things I repeat in my head about myself so I never forget them. The only power you have is the power I *decide* to give you. I refuse.”

*She is ours.*

“Of course, she is. Tiff belongs to no one and nothing, and that’s exactly what you are.”

They shrieked―or tried to. It was the impression of a shriek. The memory of a dream just moments after you wake up. *Was it real? Did that happen?*

I woke up metaphorically speaking. The grogginess faded. The footsteps and the screaming dissipated. They were the barest of impressions in the smallest recess of my mind. I ignored them.

I slid down the hood and dusted the glass from my shirt. I got in the cab. 

We continued.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Truth be told, it wasn’t the most enjoyable experience driving without a windshield. I slid a pair of sunglasses over my eyes, and brushed my cheek whenever a leaf slapped my face. Humans didn’t evolve to experience such high speeds without a screen protecting us.

It didn’t matter.

We were so close to dispatch and we’d already gone through so much. What was a bit of wind? 

Twenty minutes later I pulled into the truck yard and parked us on the non-Route 333 side. We’d officially made it.

Randall waited for me, arms-folded. “The truck looks like it got pounded with a dozen sledgehammers.”

“I got her.”

“You mean she’s―”

“In the back.” I handed him the rearview key. “She still doesn’t know what’s going on. It was sort of unavoidable, but, uh, well you should probably be the one to talk to her.” *Oh so* *comforting as you are.*

He approached the trailer. There was the sliding of a metal door. Muted talking. 

I waited near the cab. Tiff would, no doubt, be incensed. She had a right to be, but even so, wouldn’t this be a good thing? However it had happened, I’d gotten her out. Eventually, she would forgive me, and if she didn’t, that was fine too. She would still be free.

Randall approached me. “You should come.”

“Why are you so pale?”

“Just come.”

I prepared myself and followed him.

Tiff had slumped down against a wall. Her arms were around her knees, and she was sobbing. The scene reminded me of Chris all over again. 

“You’re safe.” I rested a hand on her shoulder. “It’s hard to believe. The way I had to do it was terrible, but it’s true. You’re finally back.”

“I abandoned her.”

“Huh?” I glanced at Randall. He said nothing, but his face was still white.

Tiff shrugged off my hand and glared up at me. “My daughter. She’s still in there. I’m safe, and she’s trapped.”

“Your daughter?”

1o4umon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/1o4umon/brod_taylor_sourdough_home_molding/,Brod & Taylor Sourdough Home Molding,"Hi all, I am celiac and have been trying to make this delicious gluten free sourdough that someone I knew once made! I’m using the same recipe with rice flour and water twice a day. I bought a Brod&Taylor sourdough home and some Weck jars with coffee filters on top like the person I got the recipe was using. I was so excited to get started!

However, after three weeks of trying, I have now gone through three separate starters that have molded. I first thought it might be contamination from reusing my tablespoon and possibly old flour, so I replaced my flour, started using a new tablespoon everyday, and now pour my flour directly into a small container that I’m storing airtight on my counter to scoop from for the starter. I fill this container up every few days. I also thought it might be my water since I was originally using water that was room temperature that had been sitting in my kettle overnight. I now am using Fiji water as I heard somewhere that mineral water can yield really good results. I am pouring directly from the bottle and then resealing with the cap each time. I thought things were going okay this time, but it’s day three and I opened my sourdough home and saw a little bit of mold growing. The sourdough starter has started to smell a little off, but not nearly as bad as the last time. I am getting a little exasperated at this point. I realize this sourdough home does not have great ventilation and I’ve been using it at 78deg because I wanted fast results. It’s kind of a recipe for mold growth because condensation and moisture seem to build on the inside, and I’m wondering if anyone has had an experience with this unit? Every review seems to be positive so I’m just curious how I could be failing so badly.
In addition, I was reading on this subreddit and am wondering if maybe I should sterilize my jars and tablespoons with boiling water followed by isopropyl and then use the weck lids instead. I just wonder if there’s a way I might be able to use this unit? It gets pretty cold at night in my apartment. I do have a warming mat I could use instead, but it feels like a waste to have purchased this unit and just not be able to use it. Also, it’s a brand new building so I doubt there’s a mold problem here, although I know that my dishwasher could also be a culprit…",1,1760288959.0,Sourdough,1,1.0,False

“We’ll figure something out,” I said.

“We won’t.”

“I can handcuff you or tie you up. The road might still think it’s against your will. We could trick it.”

“That won’t work,” Autumn said. We were still in the cab of my truck after learning how lane-locked drivers could escape Route 333 from the pregnant hitchhiker woman (from her newborn baby, technically).

“What if we―”

“Stop!” She slammed a fist against the dashboard. The hanging air freshener shuddered. “You can’t fix everything! It’s not your responsibility.”

“But we’ll figure this out.”

“There is no *we.* You barely even know me. It’s too late. I give up.”

“But―”

“How long do you think until the road takes you out, huh? You *know* now. It can't be happy about that. Go save the others while there's time.”

“I'm not leaving―”

“STOP!”

She clambered over the black, amniotic birthing fluid, puddled on the passenger seat and leapt from my rig.

“What are you doing?” I called.

She didn’t respond. She marched the opposite direction.

“Let me at least give you a ride,” I said. Autumn didn’t slow. “Where are you going? I can get you there safely. Autumn―”

“Leave me alone!” she screamed. “It’s only a few miles. I’m walking home by myself.”

Not to *town* or to *my apartment.* She’d accepted the town she’d been staying in as *home*. The place she now and would always live, like how Tiff had found a diner and settled down.

Autumn was giving up.

She was right. I couldn’t fix everything. I couldn’t even fix my *own* problems, and now, I’d gone and ruined her life too. By involving her in my plan, I’d taken away any chance she had of escaping Route 333. I couldn’t fix everything.

I could fix one thing.

It was the same destructive frenzy that had entered me before I’d assaulted Randall. There was no reasoning. There was no calming down and second guessing. There was only the single-minded obsessiveness that would consume me until I accomplished what I had to. I knew the secret. Route 333 had warned me once what would happen if I tried to interfere. 

I got the sense it wouldn't bother with a second. 

“What are you doing?” Randall approached me at the truck yard. His nose cast was finally gone, but there was a distinct *askewness* to his face now.

“Hooking up an empty trailer.” I crawled out from where I’d finished making sure the jaws were locked.

“Over my dead body.”

“Easily arranged.”

“You’re already deep in overtime,” Randall insisted. “We’re not financing the entirety of your starter home. Didn’t Deidree already try this?” When I ignored him, he continued. “Look, Brendon, you’re not doing anything for Chris by setting off on a fool’s errand. He’s only a year out. We’ll even keep him on as an employee. This―”

“I’m not going for Chris.”

“No?”

“Not yet, at least. Not first. I’m going for Tiff.”

“How many times have we discussed this? You’re not―”

“I know how to save her.”

His mouth, no joke, *fell* open. Apparently, that’s a thing that does happen in real life. “How―what―how do you know?”

“No time. The road knows I know. I need to go for her before it decides to take the two of us out, but if I don't make it back, radio Autumn. She can explain more to you.”

“So you *have* met that girl. Regardless, you can't just barrel into this like always. Management is already screaming at me because of you. Calm down. Let's talk about a strategy.”

I jabbed him in the chest with a finger. “You never really tried to help Tiff, did you? That was a lie. Just like everything else. You say you want to help us to make yourself feel better, but you never have. For once in your miserable life, admit the truth, Randall: you don’t care about us. You never will.”

His face flashed through a dozen emotions: confusion, anger, hurt, grief, etc. “Of course, I do.”

“Then let me go.”

He stood there. He jabbed me in my own chest. “Don't you dare make me hire your replacement. I'm busy as it is.” Then he nodded once.

I left.

Dear readers. If you were hoping for something a bit more cathartic in Randall’s and my relationship, then it’s my displeasure to inform you that’s all you’re going to get. There will be no enemies-to-BFFs story arc. No tear-jerking *he-sacrifices-his-life-for-me* or *I-take-a-bullet-for-him.* 

I don’t especially like Randall. I doubt he likes me. Likely, neither of those opinions will ever change, but turning out of the parking lot that day, there was at least something akin to *respect* between us. 

He had his job. He was good at it.

I had mine.

For lack of a better term, my mom and dad were helicopter parents.

I haven’t talked much about them. There isn’t some deep, dark backstory surrounding my childhood or anything. It simply hasn’t been relevant to my time on Route 333 until now. 

In elementary school I played soccer. My dad attended every game. On one particular Saturday morning, he stormed on the field and screamed in the referee’s face, spit flying, for yellow-carding me.

Guess who got a red card?

In fifth grade, Garrett invited me to his birthday party at the bowling alley. Parents weren’t invited. We were eleven, after all, but my Mom insisted on accompanying me anyway to make sure nothing got out of hand. She sat right at my side, between me and the other boys. When it was my time to bowl, she shouted pointers and cheered when I knocked over a single pin.

I never got an invite to Garrett’s next birthday party.

I could go on. Dentist appointments, friend issues, first dates, high school football games―there was virtually no aspect of my life they didn’t investigate, advise, or meddle in.

Don’t get me wrong. They were good parents, *great* parents even, but by the time I ever so much as mentioned the possibility of detention, they’d already contacted my teacher, the principal, and the school board for separate, outraged meetings. Very rarely did their intervention ever actually *help*. Mainly, all it taught me was that there would always be somebody else to solve my problems for me.

I won’t claim it’s their fault I’m the way I am: unable to handle life unless something with teeth is chasing me forward. I’ve seen crappy parents end up with all-star kids and vice versa. Each of us has a nature and a potential, and a moment (or a dozen) when we decide to fulfill or not to fulfill that potential. It would, however, be dishonest to say they didn’t *influence* who I am. I never quite had the chance to learn to swim before I was being thrown in front of a wave.

All of that to say this: sometimes, it's the things we do to protect people that end up hurting them.

Isn’t that what I’d done with Autumn? I’d wanted to save her. I’d tried to give her a chance, but instead, I’d taken that very chance away.

Was that what I was doing with Tiff? Would my helping her hurt her? It was possible, *likely* even, but what else was I supposed to do? At what point did aid turn into overbearing and help turn into obsession? 

That was the truth of it, I suspected. My parents. They’d loved me, but their vulture-like circling had never been about me, not entirely. It had been about their need to fix. To feel they were *good* parents doing the *right* thing for their child. Was that me? Was I the vulture? 

There were too many sides to every equation. For years, I’d been unable to tell what I should do and how I should do it. It had crippled me, knocked me over at the knees. All I did know was that I had to do *something*. If that thing wasn’t helping somebody… then what?

“Brendon?” Tiff said as I entered her red and white diner. She was wiping crumbs off one of the tables. “Could’ve sworn Deidree told me she saw you headed to dispatch.”

“Do you miss it?”

“Huh?”

“Do you wish you could go back?”

She paused mid-swipe. “Brendon, if something’s up, I’m always free to talk. You know that.” 

“No. This isn’t about me. I don’t want it to be. Tiff, I just need to know if, well, you miss it. The *real* world. Life, people, all of it. Do you wish you could go back? Would you risk your life to get there?”

Her eyebrows crinkled. She clasped her hands and the tattoos along her forearms flexed. “I’ve built something for myself here. When I got stuck, I imagine nobody in the real world asked about me much. That’s the curse of a life on a road. You’re gone so often, people tend to forget you. Relationships fade. The only person I’ve ever cared about is my daughter. If I could be with her, I’d go wherever.”

Her daughter. The one who’d passed away from cancer. Tiff rarely talked about her, but I knew it was the reason she’d started hauling on Route 333.

“I don’t mean to be insensitive,” I started, “but you can’t be with her.”

“Don’t reckon I can.”

“So you wouldn’t risk it?” My stomach unclenched. “If you had the choice? You’d stay here.”

She stared at me. She looked up at a burnt out light fixture, at the employee smiling unnaturally behind the cash register, at the fake family laughing in a corner booth. She blew out of her mouth. 

Her face grew gravely dark. “What sane person would stay?”

I nodded.

“Don’t you go doing something stupid,” she said.

I snorted and plopped myself onto a table, swinging my legs off the edge. “If only I could.”

We talked for a while. She brought me some pie. We shared a pot of the only good coffee on Route 333. It wasn’t until evening was setting in and the automatic outside lights had switched on that I said, “can I get you to check on something with me?”

“What’s that?”

I led her to the back of my truck and rolled up the trailer. She peered in. “There’s nothing in there, is there?”

“Nothing dangerous, nah. It’s…well…it’s kind of hard to explain. Can you just go check on it?”

She shrugged, climbed in, and sauntered to the back. “What were you asking about? I don’t see anything.”

I slammed the door closed.

“Brendon?” Her voice was quiet at first, inquisitive. The doors trembled, but I’d already snapped closed the padlock. “You let me out.”

“No can do.”

“This isn’t funny.”

“It’s not,” I agreed.

The banging came soon after. Then hollering. Controlled at first but increasingly more frantic. “*Brendon*!” A piece of me drooped, withered, and flaked to dust.

*It’s for your own good,* I wanted to stay, but that would be too dangerous. I couldn’t risk Tiff thinking I was doing this to help her. No more chances. I’d already wasted them on Autumn. Tiff had admitted herself she would risk her life if it meant a chance at getting home.

In the distance, clouds were rolling in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Within minutes I knew the pregnant hitchhiker woman had been telling the truth. Nothing about the desert we sailed through was new. Each landmark was familiar. Tiff now counted as unwilling cargo, and we were no longer lane-locked.

The realization should have thrilled me. This was the thing I’d fought for weeks and weeks for. My time on Route 333 hadn't been wasted.

Instead, I glanced in my rearview window periodically at the rumbling clouds growing both closer and less visible in the deepening twilight. It had been bad with the crying thing in my trailer that made other inhabitants more restless. Now Route 333 would be against me as well. 

By the time the first drops of blood hit my windshield, I knew it was too late. The road had no intention of letting me leave.

The blood turned chunkier, splatters instead of drops. I drove on. That had been my promise, hadn't it? Whatever happened, as long as there was someone to protect, I would keep my foot on the pedal.

Overhead thunder rumbled. My headlights filled with red. The asphalt was barely visible. We jostled and shuddered over debris raining onto the highway.

“Hold on!” I screamed to no one in particular. Tiff couldn’t hear me. She was alone, afraid, imprisoned in the back.

*You will not die there.*

Desert morphed into redwoods. It was a good thing Deidree had been the one to transport Chris. Otherwise, I’d have an extra hour of driving. As it was, we still had a chance.

Except we didn’t. 

Organs and ligaments were raining down now. The front window cracked and splintered in two separate places. My very cab groaned in the same way I imagined Autumn’s had. Any second and the whole thing would collapse inwards

*You will not die like this. I will not let you.*

I rolled down the windows and let loose a bellow. “You have no right! I broke none of your rules!” The storm continued to rage. “*How dare you!*”

The debris stopped falling.

The raining ceased.

My rig broke from a clear line of gruesome destruction into a fresh, untouched stretch of forest.

It had worked. My screaming had convinced the road to let us go―or so I thought. For one, glorious, relief-studded moment I truly believed Route 333 had really decided to allow us free.

Then my engine cut off. My rig slowed and stopped. My stomach joined my feet on the floor.

Route 333 hadn't let us go at all. It had merely acknowledged that for the next minute and forty-seven seconds, something *else* had claim to us first\*.\*

Since the incident with the thing in the trailer, the forest-dwellers had left me alone. They hadn't tried to speak to me or even so much as stop my truck. It was unusual; that’s what the other truckers said. All of them still experienced the same minute forty-seven slow down as they had for years. It was almost like the forest-dwellers were *embarrassed* by their last failed attempt.

They weren’t embarrassed now.

They didn’t even wait for the end of the time limit to skitter around the truck, looking for a way in. I didn’t bother hiding. What was the point? We’d spoken before. They had my scent. They *knew* I was here. Whatever happened was inevitable.

My time on the road had begun with another interviewee skewered to the roof of his vehicle. Every haul I’d made, I’d passed through here, the forest-dwellers domain. All of it, every drive, and swerve, and twist of the ignition key, had all been leading to this last confrontation.

After what seemed hours, but was probably minutes, the pattering slowed. My eyes remained firmly shut. Something low and gravely spoke from what sounded like directly on my hood. Like last time it was no voice, not truly. It was the rumble of gravel under tires, of sand sprinkled onto paper, and wings fluttering against an air current.

“Let us speak.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Alright then.”

“You will not pass this time. You know this. There is no option of escape, He Who Dwells on Stone.”

“Nah. I don’t reckon there is.”

“Once more, we demand you relinquish the life force you carry.”

“So you can trade it to the road?” I asked. “You want to get out of here the easy way, yeah? To go terrorize people in my world instead of here. Why do you all want to go there so bad? That’s what I don’t get. Do you eat us or something? Why not forge a new life for yourself here?  Why are all of you so obsessed with escaping?”

Silence.

My eyes were closed. I had no idea what was flashing across the forest-dwellers expression (if it even had a face), but I imagined conflict.

“Why are you?” it finally asked.

I found I had no good answer either.

“*Please*,” the forest-dweller said. “We have been trapped for so many turnings of this planet. We have no grievance with you. You have never gazed upon us. Relinquish her and we will have no cause to harm you or the remaining of your kind.”

“And what happens if I don’t? What if I refuse?”

“We will take her anyways.”

Outside the cab, a branch snapped in the distance. A breeze rustled the trees as if in slow ponderous consideration.

“Then you’d better do it,” I said.

“Very well.”

All at once, the slap of bare feet began once more. From all directions muttering rose up like the thing on my hood, but once more, none of them were voices. They were crackling, burning leaves and boulders crashing down mountains. They were the whisper of snow and the roar of avalanches. The sounds were everything and nothing all at once, from every direction and from nowhere, inescapable and non-existent.

The cracks in my windshield splintered. The whole thing crashed inwards. Wispy hands surrounded me, unfastened my seatbelt, and dragged me out through the windshield. Glass slashed my arms and cut into my bare calves. I screamed out.

The forces pushed me against my hood. My back arced against the curve. I tried to yank my arms and legs free, but like the hitchhikers, they were too strong. I had no chance. I never had. I was human. These impossibilities were something else entirely. 

An eyeless face flashed through my mind. A man, mouth gaping, with an entire tree trunk rammed through his chest. The pain on his face. The terror.

“We did not wish to hurt you,” the world whispered from every direction at once. “You have made this necessary.”

There was the snap of something from the side of the road, like a thick branch being yanked from its tree. I had perhaps seconds now. After everything―traversing the road, confronting Randall, learning the solution―this was where it all ended. The injustice of it all coursed through me, and I committed my one, final act of defiance.

I opened my eyes.

Above me hovered… well, *nothing.*

Not exactly. The forest-dwellers *were* there. Clear as the clouds in the sky. They stared at me from every direction, full of eyes and snapping jaws, but they were also *not* there. 

How do I explain this?

Imagine a mirage. At a glance, you clearly see the oasis. It’s so obvious, and yet, you know it’s not there. It doesn’t exist, and yet it does―except, even that's not a good example for the forest-dwellers, because a mirage is still something that’s possible and explainable. The forest-dwellers simply weren’t. They were a paradox that would drive you mad. An *impossibility*. 

Already, my mind was slipping. If we’d been in the real world, it would already be dripping out through my nose but something about the road helped me handle it. Either way, it didn’t matter. They were still going to kill me, these things that weren’t there.

But how could something hurt you if it wasn’t there?

“You don’t exist,” I whispered. And then louder, “You don’t exist.”

“We do.”

“You don’t.”

They flickered. Their tenuous state of being wavered.

“You exist as much as I believe you do, and I don’t. You can’t do anything to me.”

The world around me shuddered. The truck lurched side to side. *We exist,* they seemed to scream. Their every action was another subtle cue to convince me we inhabited the same physical realm. *We are here, and we will hurt you. We have wants. We are alive. Believe in us.*

I laughed. The force pushing me down lessened.

“You’re my late night fears,” I said. “You’re my loneliness, and the terrible things I repeat in my head about myself so I never forget them. The only power you have is the power I *decide* to give you. I refuse.”

*She is ours.*

“Of course, she is. Tiff belongs to no one and nothing, and that’s exactly what you are.”

They shrieked―or tried to. It was the impression of a shriek. The memory of a dream just moments after you wake up. *Was it real? Did that happen?*

I woke up metaphorically speaking. The grogginess faded. The footsteps and the screaming dissipated. They were the barest of impressions in the smallest recess of my mind. I ignored them.

I slid down the hood and dusted the glass from my shirt. I got in the cab. 

We continued.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Truth be told, it wasn’t the most enjoyable experience driving without a windshield. I slid a pair of sunglasses over my eyes, and brushed my cheek whenever a leaf slapped my face. Humans didn’t evolve to experience such high speeds without a screen protecting us.

It didn’t matter.

We were so close to dispatch and we’d already gone through so much. What was a bit of wind? 

Twenty minutes later I pulled into the truck yard and parked us on the non-Route 333 side. We’d officially made it.

Randall waited for me, arms-folded. “The truck looks like it got pounded with a dozen sledgehammers.”

“I got her.”

“You mean she’s―”

“In the back.” I handed him the rearview key. “She still doesn’t know what’s going on. It was sort of unavoidable, but, uh, well you should probably be the one to talk to her.” *Oh so* *comforting as you are.*

He approached the trailer. There was the sliding of a metal door. Muted talking. 

I waited near the cab. Tiff would, no doubt, be incensed. She had a right to be, but even so, wouldn’t this be a good thing? However it had happened, I’d gotten her out. Eventually, she would forgive me, and if she didn’t, that was fine too. She would still be free.

Randall approached me. “You should come.”

“Why are you so pale?”

“Just come.”

I prepared myself and followed him.

Tiff had slumped down against a wall. Her arms were around her knees, and she was sobbing. The scene reminded me of Chris all over again. 

“You’re safe.” I rested a hand on her shoulder. “It’s hard to believe. The way I had to do it was terrible, but it’s true. You’re finally back.”

“I abandoned her.”

“Huh?” I glanced at Randall. He said nothing, but his face was still white.

Tiff shrugged off my hand and glared up at me. “My daughter. She’s still in there. I’m safe, and she’s trapped.”

“Your daughter?”

It’s not even about the money at this point; it’s the principle. Everything used to last. My parents still have a microwave from the ‘90s that could probably survive a nuclear blast. Meanwhile, my “smart” devices can’t survive a light breeze or a software update.

And when you try to get it fixed? The repair cost is usually higher than buying a new one. They’ll cheerfully tell you, “It’s not worth repairing, you can just upgrade!” Upgrade to what? Another overpriced gadget that’ll give up the moment it turns one? It’s like the entire industry is designed to make you spend forever on an endless replacement loop.

I am not even asking for lifetime quality just make something that lasts longer than the damn warranty card it came with.

Sitting here, away from any bustling system, is not an easy job for ordinary individuals. In order to be qualified, each candidate was a spacer, having many years of experience in combat, before being selected by the GCNI. After the selection step, each of them must have undergone multiple extensive background checks and psychological evaluations. These tests were to ensure that no unsuitable individual could expose this location and the job due to its sensitivity and confidentiality. Therefore, only a handful could remain after that stage. One more fact, this station was near Sol, the humanity home system, and, thus, most employees were humans.

Standing next to me was my station commander, Adam Martin, whose duty was overseeing all activities of this station and this system. He had been working here for many years, even before I was chosen. Despite being a senior worker here, he was actually an easygoing person and friendly to everyone. To the point that I could hear that my commander was drinking something, and that drink could keep me awake for a day just by smelling its strong aroma.

“Umm… This coffee is definitely something!” He exclaimed excitedly.

“I thought you did not like that drink?” I asked.

“No, no, no… I said I do not like processed coffee. But this one?” He pointed his finger at the glass. “This is pure, Robusta coffee, and even smelling its powder can make you awake immediately. So, it’s definitely something.”

“Maybe I should try that drink someday.”

“Actually, this is a gift from a friend of mine living in District 75…”

I ignored his yapping and continued with my duty as a station operator. My job was just sitting in a room and monitoring multiple screens, which collected data from satellites in the outer system boundary, to alarm the GC early if we detected something or anything went wrong.  

“So, anyway, status update?” He asked after finishing his story. 

I leaned forward and carefully read out the status. “No anomalies detected, everything is normal.” 

“Alright, continue.”

When I was about to lean back in my chair, one of the monitors constantly flashed red. I quickly reacted and checked the data from that monitor.

“What is the current status?” My commander asked seriously after putting his cup down.

“One of the reconnaissance satellites has detected an anomaly,” I answered.

“Which one?”

“TRNS Listener 1, and there is also an FTL message embedded with the data package.”

“Put it on the screen.”

My paws quickly operated the console in front of me to decrypt the data package and put the message on the central monitor.

*Terran Republic Navy Satellite “Listener 1” (AI):*

*This is a high-priority package for the Grand Coalition. Embedded with the package are a detailed preliminary report, data including images, a video, and audio as evidence. This information was collected from an anomaly I detected a moment ago.* 

*The following section will summarize all my findings.*

*At 02:43:03 on 01 January 2130, Atlas Universal Time, an anomalous space noise was detected during my daily observation mission. My first course of action after the discovery was triangulating this anomaly’s origin, and the result indicated that its source potentially came from a star system designated as Gliese 832, approximately 12 Ly away from Alpha Centauri and approximately 16 Ly from Sol. After the initial scan, I quickly ran an analysis of this anomaly, and it was identified as a radio transmission after a few calc-frames.* 

*Upon deeper analysis, this transmission contained a video with audio. However, its content and the audio were unintelligible, but there was one crucial detail that I must have filed this report. Unknown figures were found in the video. Thus, I ran other analyses and scenarios to determine the possibilities. From the results of these multiple runs, I could confidently say that we have discovered a new alien species. Additionally, my first assessment of this new species was that their diet is possibly herbivorous.*

*The details of this discovery are in the report attached to the data package. My recommendation after this message is to immediately send this data package to the Grand Coalition Naval Intelligence Committee (GCNIC) to determine the next course of action.*

*TRNS Listener 1 out.*

That was something which I would not expect to happen today. I looked at Martin, and I only saw silence and pensiveness from him after that message.

“Send this message and data package as the highest priority to the GCNIC to be decided by the higher-ups.” My station commander said.

“Yes, sir,” I said while my paws were dancing on the console. “Already sent,” I confirmed after a few seconds.

“Could you show me photos of this new species?” He asked.

“Let me check.” I paused to check the package. “Alright, everything is fine to be shown.”

After I had typed in the console, the central screen changed the message to display multiple images of this species, and my first impression of these new guys was… mixed.

*A new alien species. We have not had that since the Znosian.*

*But these guys are also grass eaters like the Znosian.*

However, when I took a glance at the commander, a little curve formed on his lip, and I could even smell something from him.

“Alright, let me guess. You want to pet them, right?” I joked. In return, he chuckled and gave my shoulder a gentle pat. 

“I will take the silence and the pat as a yes,” I told him.

“Alright, Mr. I-have-a-good-sense-of-smell. I have a question for you.” He said.

“What is it?”

“What do you think about them?” He asked me after a few seconds of thinking.

“Well… At first, I was excited that we had just discovered a new species. However, that immediately turned to suspicion when the report indicated they were possible grass eaters.” I stopped to think for a moment. “As you already know, the Granti and my species have a negative impression of grass eaters because of… the Znosian and their thousand years of exterminating carnivorous species,” I said honestly.

“That makes sense. So, I hope these new guys are different from the Bun.”

“Yeah… I hope so.” I replied hopefully.

My commander and I stared at the screen in silence to process all the things that had just happened for a few minutes before he picked his cup and left. Then, there were my other colleagues in the room. While they were doing their job, I turned back to my duty and was lost in thought about an optimistic future.

*Well… I hope they will be different from the Znosian.*

*So… we don’t have to worry about the future.*

1o4uhl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1o4uhl1/earning_with_browser_referrals_no_experience/,Earning with Browser Referrals (No Experience Needed),"I wanted to share a straightforward method I've been using to generate some extra income online. This doesn't require any special skills or upfront investment.

**What This Is About**

There's a new AI-powered browser called Comet from Perplexity that has a referral program. When someone downloads it using your referral link, you earn a commission. The browser itself is legitimate and actually useful for automating repetitive online tasks.

**Why I'm Sharing This**

I've been using Comet for a few weeks and genuinely find it helpful for my online work. The referral program is a nice bonus, and I figured others here might want to know about it.

**Getting Started - The Basics**

To earn from this, you need to:

1. Download and install Comet yourself first
2. Get your unique referral link from the settings
3. Share that link with people who might find the browser useful
4. Earn when they sign up and download

**First Step: Get the Browser**

**Full disclosure**: The links below are referral links. If you find this guide helpful and want to support the time I put into it, using my link costs you nothing extra:

* **My Referral Link**: [https://pplx.ai/dmalecki0371729](https://pplx.ai/dmalecki0371729)
* **Non-Referral Link**: [https://www.perplexity.ai/comet](https://www.perplexity.ai/comet)

Download it, test it out, and then you'll get your own referral link to start earning.

**Where to Share Your Link**

Some places that work well:

* Reddit communities focused on side hustles and online work (always check their specific rules first)
* Facebook groups about productivity or making money online
* Twitter when discussing productivity tools
* Your personal network if they do online work
* Tech-focused Discord servers

**What Makes People Download**

People actually download when you explain the value, not just drop a link. The browser has AI that can:

* Auto-fill forms across websites
* Summarize long articles or terms and conditions
* Compare information across multiple tabs
* Help with research tasks
* Automate repetitive browsing activities

So your message should focus on solving problems, not just ""click my link.""

**Realistic Expectations**

Don't expect to get rich from this. Realistically:

* Casual effort: maybe $20-50 monthly
* Consistent posting: $100-200 monthly
* Building a real audience: potentially more

**Important Tips**

1. Actually download and use the browser yourself so you can answer questions authentically
2. Follow each platform's rules about referral links carefully
3. Focus on helpful content, not just link dropping
4. Be transparent that it's a referral link when asked
5. Don't spam - quality over quantity

**Common Mistakes That Get Posts Removed**

* Copy-pasting the same message everywhere
* Not providing value beyond just a link
* Ignoring community rules about self-promotion
* Being too aggressive or salesy
* Posting only referral content without engaging in communities

**How to Actually Start**

If you want to try this:

1. Use the link above to sign up: [https://pplx.ai/dmalecki0371729](https://pplx.ai/dmalecki0371729)
2. Download and test it out for a day or two
3. Find your referral link in the browser settings (usually under Account or Referrals)
4. Create one good post explaining why you find it useful
5. Share it in appropriate communities

**My Experience**

I've been using it primarily for research and form-filling. The AI assistant saves me probably 30-60 minutes daily on repetitive tasks. The referral income is secondary but covers my coffee budget.

**Your Turn**

Once you've signed up and gotten your own referral link, feel free to share it in the comments below. Let's help each other out!

**Questions Welcome**

If anyone has questions about getting started or the browser itself, happy to help in the comments.",1,1760288644.0,OnlineIncomeHustle,1,1.0,False

1st winner will receive 6 spots

2nd winner will receive 5 spots

3rd winner will receive 4 spots

There are NO Spot limits.

I bought a super basic Breville Cafe Roma a few years ago and have been upgrading parts to make the perfect latte for my wife.

I bought a Shardor Coffee Grinder, a 51mm bottomless portafilter with puck and 18g filter basket. I got a WDT tool and tamper.

I use the grinder on the lowest setting, since I still can’t get a creamy shot.

I’m also thinking I don’t have enough coffee in the basket. I’m using about 17g in my basket for a double shot.

Thanks for all the advice. My wife appreciates it.

She invited me for a date and she ""gave me the cheek"" at the end. Did I ruin everything ?","Okay so let me explain

First, I'm french please forgive my 

Two years ago, my cowoker and I started flirting. At some point we ended kissing in her car after a party, then saw each other again at 2-3 occasions and kissed at each of these moments. But she had a boyfriend and had children so one day she told me that she didn't want to continue seeing each other because she wanted to keep her relationship. I told her that it was painful but that I understood completely.

Two years have passed and I thought we would never see each other again.

But two months ago she texted me saying she was thinking about me. 

Two weeks ago she invited me to come to eat with ancient coworkers. We had a good time. I learned that she was no longer with her boyfriend. Then I texted her that it was a pleasure seeing her again after two years. I suggested we go for a coffee. She was OK with this and even invited me to eat at her place the next day (her children weren't here.)

We had a good time, laughed and talked a lot about different things. Then was the time for me to leave. We kissed each other on the cheek (it's a common way to say goodbye in France, not sure if it's the case in other places). Just after that I waited a few seconds and tried to kiss her on the lips. She gave me her cheek. There was an awkward moment, we joked about the elevator or something and then I leaved.

I then texted her that I had a great time and that we could hang out again another day. She didn't reply. I tried to call her and leaved her a message saying I was sorry for trying to kiss her and that I hoped it didn't make her uncomfortable. She then sent a message telling me that she didn't want a relationship at the moment and that she invited me to chit chat and nothing more. She also accepted my excuses and told me not to worry. But she didn't tell me if she wanted to see me again in the future. 

One week ago I asked her by text if she would like for us to just talk over on the phone but she didn't respond.

Things seem pretty simple. My questions are : did I ruin the possibility of a relationship ? And will I come off as insisting if I try to call her again ?",1,1760288445.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
1o4ue6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1o4ue6y/highly_sensitive_toddler/,Highly sensitive toddler,"My 2.5 girl seems to have mild to moderate sensory sensitivities that present in public places or when she is not in her own home like her grandparents house . She gets incredibly anxious and jumpy when at the grandparents and is all over the place with jumping from excitement and not being able to do much else so we have to leave after 1 hour . She plays really well with her peers , always waits her turn and shares nicely . No hitting , pushing etc ever . 
She is sensitive about food but as a few staples like home made bolognese pasta , egg muffins with courgettes and cheese . Lasagna with spinach , carrots , apples . Yogurt , fish cakes , curry with rice , noodles with broccoli 
She is  calm at home and plays on her own a lot , sleeps 15 hours a day , eats well etc. 
I know she might have sensory processing disorder but not a lot can be done at this stage . She struggles in a lot of places and we can’t go to restaurants or coffee shops . We can only manage food shopping . She has been having more tantrums lately . 
I know she might need an evaluation along the way but the fact that she scored really well on the five areas of development they can’t do anything about it . No OT unless private.  Her paediatrician said she has a sensory profile that leans toward cautious and active because she can focus really well on different things and self regulate but she is more sensitive than the average kid . What it actually means for her future I don’t know . 
I did mention SPD but she is not sensitive to light , touch , texture , noise to the extent of impacting her functioning  ( for now ) . 
I’d like to know please how’s school like for kids like her ? Will she ever grow out of it or improve ? ",1,1760288443.0,UKParenting,11,0.67,False

Heading to Samara in December for 2 weeks just before Christmas. Family w/ two young children. Been to Costa Rica twice before but Sámara is our first time. 

Looking for recommendations on must see’s, must do’s and must eat’s. 

Any leads on sanctuary tours ?

Best sodas, beachside restos, coffee shops & bakery’s?

Any leads on farmers markets in the area and best supermercados for stocking up on local groceries?

Best day trips in the areas? Waterfall / jungle hikes?

Anything else I would happily take - interests in fishing tours, or a sunset cruise with the family, private shuttles from Liberia to Samara (good cost), surf board rentals, and just the most family fun. 

Lots of questions - but looking for the best intel.

1o4ubgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1o4ubgd/pitfalls_of_asking_people_out_who_work_at_places/,"Pitfalls of asking people out who work at places you frequent: doctor/dentist office, coffee shop, etc.","I (52M) am new to this group and am noticing how many of us struggle with approaches “in the wild”. (As ridiculous as that term is, it seems to be well understood, so I’ll stick with it.) I think this is especially true for those of us who need to get to know someone and feel them out before we feel attracted, and can’t fathom cold approaching random strangers in the frozen food aisle.

For those of us in this camp, ample opportunities arise to get to know people on a deeper level when you regularly encounter them at businesses you frequent. Maybe they are your dental hygienist or receptionist, your barista, your server or hostess at your favorite cafe, the librarian, the trainer at your gym.

Maybe you make small talk about hobbies or other interests or activities and find commonality. You find that their energy matches yours. You don’t see a ring or hear any mention of boy-/girlfriends. There are obvious clues that there is more there beyond them just being superficially pleasant and engaging with you as a customer.

This is where I hesitate, though. Sure, you can take the plunge and ask them out. Who knows, maybe a whirlwind romance blossoms. However, what if it doesn’t? You’d like to think that at this age, we can move on like adults if it doesn’t work out and maybe even share a laugh when we see each other again. But this is real life, with human beings. And if it does go south, you risk a situation so awkward that you have to forsake a favorite business.

I have first hand experience with this. I had gotten to know my endodontist’s assistant quite well over the course of a number of root canals. (My endodontist has, no doubt, named his yacht after me.) I dug her and we had charisma, but I never worked up the nerve to ask her out—partially because I didn’t want to cross the customer/provider line. However, on one particular visit, as she was doing my standing radial x-ray, she noted how tall I am (6’6”) and that I must only like tall women. I can be dense, but even I saw that for what it was—one pitched low and slow. And in the moment, I swung at it. One thing led to another and I got her number.

We went out a few times, but it eventually fizzled out with her ghosting me. I didn’t take it personally, though. C’est la vie. Wouldn’t you know it, though, half a year later, I had another toothache and found myself dreading returning. She had revealed some gossipy things about the office to me (nothing bad about the doctor, just office drama type stuff), and since what goes around comes around, I figured she had given all sorts of dirt about me to the others at the office. (I had revealed a few private things to her.) And I didn’t know where we stood, since she had ghosted me. My endodontist is second-to-none and I wasn’t about to roll the dice with someone new, though.

I noticed she made herself scarce as I went through the preliminary visits, up to and including the actual procedure. I would see her working as I passed by her room, but they scheduled me with her coworker. I didn’t make a point to stick my head in and say hi, not wanting to make an awkward situation even worse.

I’ve been back a time or two for more root canals since then, and have noticed this pattern repeating. I don’t know if they intentionally schedule me with her coworker instead of her, but I have to think it’s not a coincidence. It’s almost like she hides when I’m there. (Previously, she would come out to chat with me, even if I was scheduled with her coworker.) I also think the receptionists smile at me funny, but that’s undoubtedly all in my head.

At any rate, I have since gotten over any awkwardness by reframing it as her problem to get over, not mine. In hindsight, though, I wish I had never pursued it. The risk was just not worth the reward. And since then, I’ve had two similar situations (one at my regular dentist, ironically) where I have great chemistry with women who give me not-so-subtle positive signs, that I end up choosing not to pursue because I don’t want to risk the business relationship.

Given how difficult it is to meet quality people in the wild, though, letting these fall through the cracks is tough. Made even tougher considering that these situations aren’t as cut-and-dry as, say, never dating a coworker, business associate, or your kid’s teacher, because there is no ethical or HR angle—just the potential for extreme awkwardness.

How have others navigated these situations? Do you draw the line like me and avoid them, or throw caution to the wind?",0,1760288278.0,datingoverforty,27,0.43,False
1o4uale,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1o4uale/sign_the_no_milk_tax_petition_to_end_the/,Sign the 'No Milk Tax!' petition to end the surcharge for plant-based milk at US coffee chains,"Petition [here](https://www.nomilktax.com/). Great (and cheering) news [article ](https://www.gcrmag.com/destroying-the-dairy-alternative-tax/)about the campaign here.

Default petition message that you can personalise sums it all up nicely: 

'I’m writing to ask that you to eliminate the upcharge for non-dairy milk. It’s unfair that customers including myself are penalized for making a choice that’s better for my health, better for the planet, and more inclusive.

'More than 350 US chains including Starbucks, Dunkin, Dutch Bros, Gregorys, and Blue Bottle already offer non-dairy milk options at no additional charge, acknowledging that dairy is one of the largest contributors to their carbon footprint. Dairy also consumes disproportionate amounts of water and land compared to plant-based alternatives.

'But this isn’t just a sustainability issue. It’s also about equity. Nearly 50 million Americans—disproportionately people of color—are lactose intolerant. Millions more live with milk allergies. Charging extra for an option they need is not just unfair—it’s discriminatory.

'If you truly care about sustainability, inclusivity, and your customers, the non-dairy tax doesn’t align with your values. Until this policy changes, I’ll be taking my business to competitors who’ve embraced more forward-thinking pricing.'

1o4u97d,https://i.redd.it/32nwxfzdopuf1.jpeg,"Sanjay's Cafe, Tunbridge Wells - ""Tummy Teaser"" £11.50","Went to Tunbridge Wells to do some Sunday shopping and fancing a late breakfast. Saw this Cafe had good reviews and it did not disappoint. This was the smaller option, with the big breakfast costing an extra £2, but pretty much doubling all the portions.

Bacon and sausages were perfectly cooked and of a good quality, juicy yet with a good crisp to them. Mushrooms were excellent, and the hashbrown was super crispy and fluffy on the inside. Only slight disappointment was the egg which had yolk that looked a tad pale, but still went down well. Beans were cooked well, not watery at all. I can't comment on the tomatoes as I'm not a fan but they did look appetising. Only wish there was some black pudding included too. 

The toast was great as well. The photo probably doesn't do it justice on how toasted it was, but it was thick cuts of fresh bread and toasted (in my opinion) just to right level, although I could see how people might like it toasted for longer. There was also an extra slice of toast but I was hungry.

The coffee here was good too, strong and smooth, without much of the bitterness you sometimes get. 

I've paid a lot more for considerably worse, and I would recommend to anyone who lives in the surrounding area or is passing through to visit Sanjay's, although bear in mind it is a very small cafe seating only around 15 max. ",29,1760288136.0,fryup,9,1.0,False

Most days, I settle for just being near them, hiding this quiet storm inside me. I don’t expect anything, I don’t want anything but I can’t stop imagining what it would be like if I dared.

1o4u49j,https://www.reddit.com/r/baristaexpress/comments/1o4u49j/sage_barista_express_impress_grinder_problem/,Sage Barista Express Impress: Grinder Problem?,"Hello everyone,

I've been using my Sage Barista Express Impress for almost a year and I'm very happy with it.

I use beans from the Supermarket/Lidl. Nothing special. But they're fine for me. I've tried a variety of beans.

For the first few months, I used the machine with the included double-walled 2-cup coffee filter and the factory settings it came with. (Inner burr 6 / & grind setting at 17).

Later, I used the included single-walled 2-cup coffee filter and adjusted the grind setting slightly accordingly.

No problems so far.

Until now....

A few days ago, I changed my mind and went back to my double-walled 2-cup coffee filter.

Now I'm having the problem that the coffee runs through with the original settings (inner burr 6 / & grind setting at 17) are going through faaaaaar too fast. (FYI: I made a note of the grind setting for all the beans I used.)

So I set the grind finer and finer. The results didn't improve. Actually the different burr/grinder settings don´t seem to change anything.

I even changed the internal grinder settings from 6 (factory settings) to 5, 4, 3, 2, and even 1. I lowered the main grind accordingly.

The inner grinder starts making strange noises at settings 2 and 1. I think this is intentional, as a protective mechanism.

Regardless of the settings, the shot is still faaaaar too fast. In fact, it doesn't seem to make any difference which grind setting is selected.

The outer grinder setting seems to be working; I can see the changes in the distance between the inner and outer grinders when I look inside the grinder.

Sounds crazy. I know. I've spent two days cleaning the grinder with my vacuum cleaner, making sure nothing is clogged.

After grinding 1 kg of espresso beans for the trash, I'm at my wit's end.

The only conclusion I can draw is that the grinder is worn out after less than a year. Is that possible?

I use the machine privately. In a single household. So, it's really average.

I'd be very grateful for any suggestions, tips, and tricks.

Thank you very much.",1,1760287822.0,baristaexpress,0,1.0,False

In the same way, One Hundred Years of Solitude uses fantasy to illustrate its own Realist sort of issues in regards to colonization, isolation, modernity, etc, I use the speculative elements to enhance the Realist, or in my case, the psychoanalytical framework of the novel as a whole. 

Does anyone find that writing works that tread that line of character based fiction that takes bits and pieces from genre fiction, specifically genre that is focused on ideas/setting/plot over the inner lives of the characters to be an exercise in abstractness? That is to say, the color that makes certain genre fiction books/movies/games feel especially *of their genre* gets lost when I move the focus of the overall text to the inner vs purely the outer. 

Specifically, in the case of a text that uses cyberware as a commonplace sort of thing, you think that it would be just as common and nonchalant  as a character drinking coffee, or brushing their teeth, and so it becomes mundane in its own right...and yet in most genre fiction, the speculative trope becomes a sort of wondrous obsession in its own right, rather than just a quasi-monotonous object in the character's life. It seems that genre fiction knows it is genre fiction and uses its speculative elements as a sort of amusement park, which gives us, the reader, a perception of color and space and familiarity, when in reality, I find that, as a Realist author in the vein of Tolstoy, Hugo and Eliot, it's not the object itself that should give the text meaning, but the way the character deals with the monotony of the event.

1o4u1j7,https://v.redd.it/h2h9mgsxmpuf1,A fine offering from blue tokai after a long time.,"Brewed my first cup from the Producer Series today — and it was almost perfect.
Right off the bat, you get hit in the face with jasmine, followed by a subtle apple juice sweetness. (Not sure why they’ve listed custard apple on the bag — I’m definitely getting apple juice vibes here.) 🍎
Here’s how I brewed it:
Coffee: 17.5g @ 15 clicks on Timemore C2 (slow fed)
Hack for clarity: Since the C2 produces a lot of fines, I sift them out using a tea infuser basket. Makes a night-and-day difference.
From 17.5g, I get about 15g of consistent grounds and 2.5g of fines.
Recipe (Iced V60 / Samo Bloom):
Add 80–90g of ice to the carafe.
Start with a cooler bloom (aka Samo bloom) — 45g water at 75–80°C for 45s.
Raise temp to 92°C:
At 0:45 → Pour to 90g
At 1:30 → Pour to 150g
At 2:10 → Pour to 200g
At 2:50, reintroduce the 2.5g of fines, and with 88°C water, pour up to 250g total.
Total drawdown: ~3:50
Result:
A medium-light bodied cup, almost tea-like in texture.
Clean, floral, and complex — with great clarity without sacrificing body.
Sifting out the fines early prevents stalling and astringency. Adding them back later keeps the mouthfeel intact — especially since the brew’s already ice-bypassed.
Water: 90ppm
Cup profile: Floral-forward, clean, jasmine-heavy with a crisp apple finish. 🌸🍏",5,1760287652.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Vegas for a few years now — moved here on my own and have pretty much been solo since! I’m a single woman working full-time downtown, so between work and life, it’s been hard to meet new people or build a solid circle out here. It’s not that I don’t want to — I just work a lot, and I’m not really into the whole bar scene.

So here I am, trying to put myself out there and find some genuine friends — people who actually want to do things together.

A little about me:
	•	I live near Craig & Rancho.
	•	I love hitting EOS (would love a workout buddy 💪).
	•	On Friday nights, there’s a car show across the street from EOS that I always think would be more fun with a crew.
	•	I’m into pool days 🏊‍♀️, dancing 💃, and trying new food spots.
	•	I’d also love to have friends who are into outdoor stuff — hiking, day trips, exploring nature, all that good energy.
	•	I’m even open to chill things like a book club, movie nights, or creative hangouts.

Basically, I’m just looking for good people who have similar interests and want to build real friendships — the kind where you can text someone last minute like, “Hey, wanna go for a hike or grab coffee?”

If that sounds like your vibe, comment or DM!

We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more career wise and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. Just back on the position I was in. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a boy . He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

[Recording Begins]

I think it's getting light outside. The storm has not stopped. All night it hammered the ground, and now at dawn it is stronger. 

Water rushes past the pod in brown sheets, carrying reeds and branches that knock against the hull. Seams weep and the walls drip with condensation so that it rains in the pod. I’ve given up trying to stay dry because my bedding is a sponge.  My clothes are soaked against my skin. The air smells of rot, mud, and metal.

The ditches overflowed in the first hours. So I cower here inside this coffin.. Condensation gathers at the roof, then falls on me in fat drops. The air grows fouler by the hour.

I look into the clay jars where I keep the flour and figs. The flour is clumping already, mold at the edges. The figs sweat and shine with moisture. Soon they will spoil. The work of days undone in one night.

The noise is worst of all. The storm is not only raw sound pounding into my mind. It has a presence, pressing in from every side. The hammering on the hull drowns my thoughts.

I whisper to you, Witness, so I do not drown in silence too: 

I am trapped

End of Log


[Recording Begins]

Its dark. That's all I can say about the time, Witness. The rain has not weakened. If anything, it has grown angrier. The sound is endless, a roar that beats into my skull until I hear it even when I press my hands to my ears.

The pod stinks now. Rotten grain, mold, sweat, and metal. Every breath tastes sour. I tried to eat some of the flour before it turned, pinched between my fingers and swallowed dry. It stuck in my throat like clay and caused horrific cramps. I drank from the purifier until the pain eased.

I have no fire. No light. No heat but my own. My bedding is soaked through. When I lie down, water squeezes from the reed and insulation mat and soaks my side. When I sit, condensation drips from the ceiling onto my shoulders.

The pod was my salvation. Now it feels like my tomb. The air is wretched, each breath heavy. I cannot see the sky, cannot hear anything but the storm.

Nan’s words come back to me: “The storm always passes, but it always takes something with it.” 

I wonder what this one will take from me.

I tell you, Witness. I want to endure, but I am being worn away. A little more with every drop.

Year One, Day Sixteen

[Recording Begins]

The rain hasn’t stopped. I have simply been sitting here, rotting in my own filth The pod walls are slick and sweating, you practically drink the air. I am on the floor, knees against my chest, rocking to keep warm.

I’m so tired. My head is full of water hunger aches at my insides. Yet the rain has not stopped. 

Nan?

 I see her in the corner of the pod, her hair wrapped in a patterned cloth. She’s looking at me the way she did when I was a boy caught out in a storm. Her eyes are full of patience but also disappointment. She's shaking her head at me. 

Nan, I dug the ditches like you said. I tried to keep the fire banked. I tried. 

She sits there. Staring at me in silence. Only the hiss of water running down the walls.

I’m not crying, I’m not crying, Nan. I’m just wet. Just wet.

Her voice.. I hear her in my head. ""Keep your hands busy, Odwa. The storm will pass."" 

I can’t keep them busy in here. Everything’s gone. The figs, the flour, the fire. Even my strength wanes. 

Witness? I don’t know! Am I talking to a machine, to Nan, or to myself?

I’m not ready to die, Nan. But I’m tired of being alone. Tired of being trapped in this coffin! How can I go on year after year like this? Alone without th nothing but my thoughts and not go mad?? 

She's fading Witness! The corner is empty again. The storm rattles the pod. Only one word echoes in my mind.

 ""Endure."" 

I close my eyes and whisper to you, Witness: 

If you ever play this back, know that I tried. Tonight I tried to keep my mind whole. I tried to endure.

Year One, Day Seventeen

[Recording Begins]

It's morning, Witness. There is the smallest sliver of light showing through the viewport window. 

The storm is still here, but it has softened. The pounding roar is only a steady drumming now, like fingers on a roof instead of hammers on steel. I opened the pod hatch just enough to let air in. It smells like mud and rot, but it is not the stale coffin-breath I’ve lived in. I keep my face near the hatch and breathe deep. 

I feel hollow. My stomach twists with hunger, my limbs shake. What worries me is  that my head feels most fragile. I almost spoke aloud to you as if you stood beside me. Perhaps I did. Perhaps I imagined Nan too clearly. Her eyes, her silence, the word she left me: 

Endure.

The figs are gone, a puddle of sour paste. The flour has clumped and darkened; I spat it out this morning, too bitter to swallow. Only a few roots remain, half-spoiled, and the two ration packs. I swore I wouldn't eat them. But if I do not I won't have the strength to rebuild. So I accept my failure and tear open a pack and pour the gruel paste into my mouth, hating myself for the weakness. 

The pod is slick with condensation, but the rain is easing enough that I may try to step out later, gather wood, dry it under shelter, coax fire back to life. Without flame, I am no better than the apes whose shadows haunt this valley. With fire, I am still a man.

Witness, I will not let the storm unmake me. My Nan said when the water passes, it takes something with it. I think this one took my pride. What is left is stubbornness. I am a man, with a mind and the ability to adapt. I must adapt. I close my eyes and retreat into myself and do a mental check. 

 I am here with a spear I laced with wire stripped from a pod that fell from a sky I once only watched. I bank my fire because heat can be trapped, held, harnessed. Slow the air and that keeps the ember from racing to ash. I store  water in clay because capillary pull is a slow thief and clay resists it when you pack it tight. 

These are not tricks. They are ideas I learned before I could name them, hammered into me by a woman with a tin cup and a knife and a voice that said touch the world until it tells you what it is.

I am supposed to be a man of numbers and plots. I am that. I am also a boy again when I crawl through the grass and taste the wind. My work has never changed. Translate. Take what the world is doing and say it out loud where a mind can hold it. I used to do that with a microphone and a link. I do it now with you, Witness. A black box full of light. A patient ear that will not answer back. I speak so I do not forget who I am.

The storm lashes at the pod, Witness. It rattles and shakes in the gusts. The air is quite foul and stale in here but to open the hatch further means the pod will be flooded in minutes. I need to keep my mind off of it. 

Good night, Witness. Keep this one safe. If anyone ever hears it, tell them I was not only lost. I was doing what I always did. I was listening, and naming, and learning the shape of things until I couldn't any longer.

Year One, Day Eighteen 

[Recording Begins]

Good Morning Witness! 

Today I was given a gift.

I dragged myself out of the pod when the rain eased this afternoon, cut some branches, stripped bark, stacked the wet wood under the porch. It smoked more than it burned, but with patience, I nursed a flame from the few dry shavings I found. The fire is back. My hands stink of smoke, and I welcome it.

While I waited for the wood to catch, I set to cleaning the pod. The walls are slimy with condensation, my stores ruined, my bedding a sodden mat. I wiped and wrung, muttering curses, and that is when I found it.

A packet wedged deep in the supply netting. Silver foil, wrinkled and half-torn. I thought at first it was more rations, but no. 

It was coffee! Instant, powdered coffee. Four servings, maybe five if I stretch them.

I boiled water in a cup I fashioned from pod metal and then poured the black dust in, stirred with a reed. The smell hit me first. Not the sour rot of figs, not the must of mold, not the metal stink of rainwater. Coffee. Sharp, rich, beautiful coffee.

I drank slowly, burning my tongue, letting the heat seep into my bones. It carried me back to nights at the lab, papers stacked high on my desk. My hands shaking with equations and exhaustion. It carried me back to Nan’s porch, where she sipped hers with sugar and laughed at my grimace.

For a few moments, Witness, I was not in a drowning world of mud and storms. I was myself again.

It is a small thing, but it feels like salvation.

The rain has broken at last. The grass around the pod is matted flat, pressed into the soil, and I can finally see across the valley again. The slope runs down into a plain of waterlogged green.

There are silver streams winding everywhere. They combine into a great complex of rivers and marsh land, grass and reeds already beginning to grow and stretch. I sit now on the pod with my few swallow s left steaming in my hand looking out onto the plai...

Witness! Witness! I wish you could see this! 

At first it was just a single line moving out of the far hills. But then I spotted another, and another! The plain is filling with bodies! Antelope, zebra, buffalo, all coming out of the hills in steady procession!

I try to count, but there are too many. Hundreds, thousands! A flowing tide of animals spilling across the grass. As if called by the plain itself for some great convocation of nature. 

They are not as I knew them. Every one larger, stronger, brighter. Ten, twenty percent greater than the animals I studied in my own time. Their horns sweep wider, their coats shine richer, their hooves pound the sodden ground with more weight. It is as if the earth here has poured more of itself into them.

And now the elephants come!

I thought I knew what an elephant was, but I was wrong. These are giants! Bulls with shoulders higher than any modern elephant's head. Giant tusks longer than a man is tall. They move slow and steady, and with each step the ground seems to quake beneath them. One lifts its head toward me, ears wide. His tusks are gleaming wet. I can feel the air shift with its breath. His trumpet booms out, announcing his families arrival. The smell is overpowering despite the distance. 

In this land of predators, perhaps only such size keeps them safe. I can imagine the sabertooths testing them, lions circling their calves, hyenas following the herds. Predation has not made them weak. It has made them titans! 

I sit on the pod, feeling small and silent. Wide eyed I watch them pass below. I feel awe, but also fear. If the land can raise beasts of this scale, what chance does a man have here?

Witness, I record this so I will not forget. The storm stripped me down. Today it gave me this vision. The world before decline, the world as it once was.

 It is vast. Abundant. Magnifcent. I am nothing but guest at its edge. Just another animal trying to stay alive.

Year One, Day Nineteen

[Recording Begins]

Good morning, Witness.

I cannot sit idle. The valley floor is too wet, the wood too waterlogged to burn. If I am to live, I need dry fuel, and that means climbing higher up the ridge.

I keep the spear in my hand. It steadies me, not because it will stop a lion or a sabertooth, but because it gives me something to grip. I move in short bursts, crouching from rock to bush, pausing in every patch of cover. I watch, I listen, I sniff the air. Nan’s voice is in my mind again: “Never walk proud when the grass whispers, Odwa. Keep low. The hunter that shows his back first does not come home.”

So I keep low.

The air is damp with the smell of mud and dung. The herds passed this way last night. I can see their prints, wide and deep, pressed into the wet slope. A huge patch of dung steams. The grass is torn, the soil churned. I follow, but not far, always stopping to scan the ridgeline.

There is silence here, but it is not peace. It is the silence of eyes watching from places I cannot see. I grip the spear tighter and press on.

At last I find it. An isolated patch of thorn scrub clinging to a rock face. The rain has not reached all of it. I snap branches, dry and sharp, and stack them under my arm. They smell of resin, sharp and clean. They will burn.

I tell you this, Witness, because my hands still shake. The climb, the silence, the knowledge that death can come from any shadow. It all presses close. But Nan’s words carry me. “Fear is the thread that keeps the mind sharp. Hold it, but do not let it bind you.”

I descend slowly, darting from cover to cover with the weight of fuel in my arms. My eyes never stop moving. The storm took much, but today I will steal it back.

[Recording Begins]

Witness… I froze just now. I came down the ridge, fuel in my arms. I am tired but proud, ready to see smoke again. And then I saw them.

A pride of lions sprawled across the slope. Three females, their bellies full and heavy. Cubs tumbling between them. And stretched along the roof of the pod, as if it were a rock outcrop, the male. His mane dark and wet, his paws hanging down the side, tail flicking with the ease of a king.

My shelter, my little foothold in this world. My pod has been turned into a throne for lions.

They did not see me. I dropped flat in the grass, the spear pressed against my chest, the bundle of thorn digging into my ribs. I did not breathe. I watched their sides rise and fall, listened to the low rumble of their growls, the coughs of cubs.

I am downwind. If that shifts, I am dead.

Nan’s voice again: “When the great cats lie in your path, Odwa, you are not the hunter. You are the shadow.”

So I lie here, Witness, hidden in the wet grass, hoping theyndecide to move on. The fire will have to wait. My hunger will have to wait. Even my pod, my drowning chamber, belongs to them now.

[Recording Begins]

I moved higher into the rocks, Witness. The grass gave me no cover and the wind began to shift. I could feel my scent drifting. Better stone under me than mud. From here I can see the pod below, and I can observe the lions.

They are patient creatures. The females lie flat in the reeds. Their eyes fixed on the herds moving at the valley’s edge. Buffalo graze careless, unaware of what waits. The male stays on the pod, lifting his leg and casually licking his balls. Finally he scans the slope like a king surveying his realm and my pod his watchtower.

I sit in shadow, still as I can, my spear across my knees. I can hear the low rumble of the lioness closest to the porch. It is not a sound made for me, but it makes my skin crawl all the same.

Nan whispers in my mind: “Let the cats eat, Odwa. Their teeth are not for you if their bellies are full.”

So I wait. I watch as they shift, tails twitching, shoulders low. The cubs have gone still, sensing the hunt. The buffalo draw nearer, and I know soon there will be a charge, a cry, a kill.

It is strange, Witness. I am cold, wet, hungry, trapped in the rocks with nothing but a spear. Yet part of me feels wonder. To see this plain as it once was, to watch lions hunt in a world not yet diminished. This is something no modern man was meant to see, let alone live in. 

Still, if they turn their eyes from the herd to me, wonder will not save me.

 Year One, Day Twenty 

[Recording Begins]

I've been here all night Witness.

The lions are still here. At dawn I eased myself to the lip of the rocks, hoping they had moved on, but no they have not. They stand over their kill which lies not two hundred meters from the pod, and they are still feeding. The area around my pod is alive with predators and vicious scavengers. If I went there I would have to lock myself inside the pod. So instead I wait here in the rocks up the ridge, unseen and unnoticed. 

The pride tears and gnaws, their faces black with blood. The cubs drag scraps into the grass, growling like little adults. Around them the scavengers wait. Hyenas slink low, jackals dart back and forth, vultures circle and land nearby. The lions guard their feast, they snap and roar at anything that dares approach.

I will have to  watch this dance of predator and scavenger all day until the lions had their.... 

Wait.. Something is moving in the grass near the kill. Shapes are rising, at least ten maybe more! 

Not beasts, not predators of claw and fang. These were altogether different. Shapes that stand upright. Hunched, shaggy, yet unmistakably human in their outline. They rose from nowhere out of the grass in a wide arc carrying branches like clubs, rocks heavy in their hands.

They did not skulk or hide. They screamed. A chorus of raw, furious cries, echoing across the slope. They waved the branches high, jumping and slapping the ground. Several began hurling rocks. 

The lions snarled and held their ground, manes bristling, teeth bared. For a moment I thought the pride would strike and kill them all.

But one rock struck the male square in the shoulder. Another glanced off his flank. He roared and twisted, tail whipping, mane wild. The lionesses hissed and moved forward, but the branches came down in a storm of blows, more rocks sailed, and at last the pride turned. With growls and lashes of their tails, they gave ground, backing away from the carcass. Hissing and gathering by their cubs. 

The apes pressed forward, screaming louder, throwing more stones until the lions slunk off into the grass. Then they fell on the buffalo themselves, driving off the scavengers and tearing at what the lions had left.

Witness, I record this with shaking hands. These are no animals. They are not yet men, but they are not beasts either. I have just seen the first people!

[Recording Begins]

Midafternoon. The hominins are gone. They left as suddenly as they came. As they shrieked and waved their clubs, they melted back into the grass with large strips of meat in their hands. The scavengers wait at the edges. The hyenas pacing low, vultures wheeling, jackals slipping closer.

And I… I did not wait.

I ran. Down the slope, heart pounding, spear in one hand, knife- in the other shouting and raising both into the air. The Scavengers backed off. Not knowing if the others were still nearby. I had mere moments.

The lions had opened the carcass, the hominins had hacked it, and a haunch hung nearly severed, dangling by a few wet tendons. I cut fast, knife edge biting, blood hot on my hands.

That was when I felt eyes on me.

From the grass not far off, one of them had stopped. A female, I think. She was smaller than the rest. She was crouched low, clutching a strip of meat to her chest. Our eyes met for a heartbeat. She had heavy brows, her face shadowed, along with a brutal scar over her right eye. 

The orb was cloudy and dead. She had long, course hair covering her head and shoulders, thinning below. I swear there was something behind that eye. I did not see fear, nor challenge, only curiosity. 

For a long moment our eyes met. Then she turned and loped after the others, shrieking.

The tendon gave way under my blade, and I staggered back with the haunch in my arms. Heavy, slick, almost too much to carry. Behind me the scavengers howled, furious at my theft. I shouted back, a raw sound torn from my throat. I raised my spear and mock charged a jackal. It padded away. I then turned and hauled the meat uphill.

Back at the pod I dropped it by the porch, chest heaving. My arms were shaking with the weight and the fear. For the first time in weeks I have more food than I can eat in a day. For the first time I feel what it means to take, not just to wait.

But I cannot stop thinking about her eyes, Witness. They saw me. Not beast, not kin, not stranger. Instead something strangely in between.

I am ashamed, strangely. I live another day. But I did it through theft like a rat. No brave struggle like the hominins. No desperate battle against a pride of lions. 

I realize now. I am beneath even my own kin on the food chain. But I am no longer invisible.

I decided to take a break from coffee since I wasn’t working. This completely full can only had one brew made out of it.  I am now back to work now so I’ll be needing my fix to combat afternoon slump.

Coffee prices have skyrocketed since I bought this.  A new one is $26 (this one was $9.99 on sale last year).  My other usual brand is now $37. It’s perfectly safe and caffeine doesn’t break down but it’s been open for 15 months (yuk).

I know it’s such a trivial thing with all the things going on in the world, but the self centred part of me wishes I could afford the luxury of throwing away stale coffee.

Honestly I felt a little intimidated so I decided to try a bunch of different recipes and figure out how, if any the resulting cup would be affected.

For each recipe I tried to keep flow rate around 8-10 g/s as to promote laminar effect for more even and consistent extraction with the exception of 5 pour aggressive brew, for that method I pushed the kettle to cause as much turbulence as possible. And poured closer to 4-5 inches above, just before splattering. Bloom for every method was 45 seconds. 

Lance’s Two pour method.
210 degrees 18 clicks 540 uhm- 3 inches above brew bed
2 pour- bergamot right away, very upfront jasmine tea caught me off guard because it didn’t taste very much at all like coffee, no citrus tea like mouthfeel, not really any sweetness (finished 2:24)

200 degrees 18 clicks 540 uhm- 3 inches above brew bed
2 pour
More jasmine tea upfront, floral, no citrus, not very sweet, tea like mouth feel almost watery.
(Finished 2:28)

3 pour method - 45 gram bloom, at 45 seconds 150 grams, 1:35 250 grams. 
210 degree 18 clicks 540 uhm- 3 inches above brew bed
Significantly sweeter upfront, sweetness and jasmine they kind of blend together, some florals, very small amount of citrus and better fuller mouthfeel not quite syrupy but more body. The ending and after taste reminds me of an almost Ethiopian earthy note. (Started to clog around 2:30 finished just under 2:58)

3 pour method - 45 gram bloom, at 45 seconds 150 grams, 1:35 250 grams. 
200 degrees 18 clicks 540 uhm - 3 inches above brew bed
-up front initially weak body, very tea like, jasmine at the front of the mouth. Some bitterness towards the end, nothing special

3 pour method - 45 gram bloom, at 45 seconds 150 grams, 1:35 250 grams. 
210 degrees 18 clicks 540 uhm low agitation very close to bed maybe an inch.
-Jasmine up front, body smooth and velvety, cup was most rounded and blended. Not very much clarity. The resulting cup lacked any layers to it.

5 pour method-I disregarded time only waited for each pour to draw down leaving the bed empty. After each pour the drawdown in between each pour became slower. (My assumption is the aggressive pours forced more fines to navigate to bottom of the brew bed.)
Aggressive agitation high pour just before splatter 
210 degrees 30 clicks 900 uhm
Longest drawdown by far 4:25, medium body not quite velvety, some sweetness mixed up front with the jasmine, and as cup cooled sweetness remained with a tiny bit of acidity coming through towards the end.

This entire experience leads me to want to try different processes of coffee and brewing all of them in various ways to figure out if there is a way  to consistently pull top end flavors and clarity out, regardless of processes to help save myself and others time when dialing in.

We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more career wise and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. Just back on the position I was in. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those...

I met my girlfriend two years ago. We’re both lesbians.
When we met, she had just broken up with her partner of nine years, because her ex is polyamorous and my girlfriend isn’t. They kept a close and friendly relationship, since they own a business together. She always said her ex was her “best friend”, and they sometimes went on “work trips” or met up for coffee.

At the time, it didn’t bother me. About a year ago, I found out they had shared a bed on one of those trips. It really hurt me — I felt it was crossing a line. She apologized deeply and swore that nothing sexual happened, that it was just her best friend and the hotel room had already been booked.

Her ex even told me the same thing , that there was nothing romantic between them, just a very strong bond, almost like a mother-daughter relationship. My girlfriend has always been sweet and loving, and her family and friends have always treated me with kindness and respect.

Then last Thursday, she had a bike accident broke her arm and lost a few teeth. I immediately rushed to take care of her and spent every day by her side.

Today, her ex asked me to help set up her new iPhone. My girlfriend also asked me to check if everything had synced to the cloud because she’s terrible with tech. That’s when I discovered the photos and messages… and eventually looked through their WhatsApp conversation.

Here’s what I found:
- I love you,” “kisses,” “my love” every morning
-Her ex sending photos like “here’s the picture from 7 years ago when I proposed to you”
-Messages about when they’d be sleeping together
-Recent photos of the two of them in bed together on “work trips” and kissing in front of a mirror at work
-Her ex saying “I’m glad you have two girlfriends who love you”
-Her ex mocking the fact that my girlfriend had made a group chat with the three of us on Instagram: “Good thing I didn’t call you ‘my love’ lol”
-My girlfriend replying “I want to share my life with you.”

When I saw all this, I woke her up screaming, O was heartbroken. She barely opened her eyes and said, “I’m sorry, she’s my best friend,” and then added that “they never kissed with tongue.” (I almost fainted when she said that.)

I left immediately and I’m now staying at a friend’s place. I feel completely betrayed and lost. I love her, she’s always been kind and caring and her family and friends have been nothing but good to me. But I don’t know how to handle this, or if I can ever trust her again.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you deal with it? Should I even consider staying in this relationship, or is it over?

I currently have a Lenovo Ideapad S340 that I purchased around early 2020. I'm pretty annoyed that it's already falling apart. I was expecting to get a couple more years out of it so I can build a gaming desktop.

I mainly used my laptop at home, but I have packed it in my backpack several times when going to the coffee shop and flying.

The screen hinges have gotten stiffer, which causes the main body to flex. The screws under the laptop don't keep the cover on tight anymore. The screw holes on the cover are broken through. So even if you tighten the screws, it doesn't tighten down the cover. Because the laptop is so loose, it makes a lot of annoying rattles and noise when typing on it. I've tried to fix this myself but haven't been successful.

1) Is this worth taking to a shop to get fixed?

2) When buying a new laptop, what should I look for to ensure I get a laptop that will stay solid and tight over the long run?

3) What laptop brands do the best job in the build quality department short of a tough book?

He’s usually meticulous: MBA student, always calculating his side-hustle earnings, obsessively quiet. So when I heard his key fumbling in the lock well past midnight, I knew he was either exhausted or high on caffeine.
He walked in, and I swear, the man looked like he'd just finished a 10-mile marathon in a tuxedo. His hair was slightly ruffled, and his eyes had that thousand-yard stare. He didn't even say salaam—he just collapsed onto the sofa.
""Don't. Ask,"" he croaked, burying his face in a cushion.
I waited. I know the drill.
""It was... five of them,"" he finally mumbled, his voice muffled. ""Five girls. From Coffee Bean. I thought, 'Easy money, straight run.' I was thinking about the down payment for the car... then they started.""
He sat up suddenly, his eyes wide.

""Ahmed, they weren't singing; they were howling. Like a pack of very melodic wolves. It was 'Sabko Sab Nahi Milta,' and I'm telling you, I was having a spiritual experience driving through Phase 5. My brain was trying to process the route, and all I could hear was a five-part harmony that kept missing the high notes. I went silent because I was afraid if I opened my mouth, I'd either start crying or join in.""

He pulled out his phone and showed me the payment screen. Rs. 580.
""Five hundred and eighty rupees,"" he sighed dramatically. ""For an hour of what the passenger called 'therapy.' She said I deserve a medal for enduring 'noise pollution and chaos.' I wanted to give her a 1-star for sonic terrorism, but then she smiled, and I swear, I forgot how to use the app.""

He shrugged, poured the water, and finally gave a small, genuine smile. ""It was the most ridiculous ride I've ever taken.”",28,1760287052.0,IslamabadSocial,35,0.75,False

Totally my fault for not knowing how to read this late in life, but seeing “$9 breakfast sandwich with no sides and we bust a warm load of cream cheese in it” on the menu kinda had me assuming there was more than egg and cheese on that sandwich you know? I feel like $9 should earn me at least some Oscar Meyer in the air fryer. I shouldn’t have been shocked at this though considering they also had a $14 turkey sandwich with probably no sides for some reason and also potentially named after some guy. It might include neither of those things, all I know is it was $14 and immediately averted my gaze. I have $14, but I would enjoy spending that more on an overpriced preroll.

“I heard from a little birdie you get to train a new hire.”

I was restocking the cups as soon as I started my shift, Tommi, sat at the small table nearby with his sketch book out and three energy drinks and two of them drank already. Tommi run the local tattoo parlor down the street from the gas station I work at, he keeps his shop open well past midnight as he says drunk people rake in a lot of money. 

“I guess so. ‘Derick or Daren’ something like that,” I said barely looking over at him as I shoved more cups into the dispensers. 

“I heard he’s some transfer from the county over. Scott said he was a bit too uppity for his liking, like a squirrel who drank an expresso,” said Tommi, completely matter of fact. “Scott doesn’t like him.” 

Scott who works on the swing shift who’s a thirty something year old man doesn’t like people in general. But I get it, a very bubbly person isn’t made for this job, especially working the overnight shift after working for the last few weeks overnight, and the weird out of this world things that tend to happen to me wasn’t going to leave a good impression on the new guy. It might traumatize him, I mean David the previous overnight guy quit stopped showing up for a week after something happened to him. 

“Well, we’ll see how long he lasts,” I said as I opened the cupboard pulling out lids. 

Personally, I’ve never trained new employees even at my last job, and I know for a fact it’s not worth the energy to do. I’ve seen previous managers babysitting the new hires and seeing how frustrating it was, but that was back at my previous job, this one would be easier to train, although trying to teach them not to do certain things would be difficult. 

I liked to be a loner, although the weird noises and Sweeper, and the homelessness that comes through here, I didn’t really have to make conversation with people, well besides Tommi. Tommi was the kind of outgoing extravert that fills the quiet space with his talking, most of his spiels are entertaining. 

Tommi’s sketches were everywhere, showing off his talent as an artist and owner of his own tattoo parlor. Inspired, I considered my own dreams until the doorbell chimed. I turned from the cash wrap and called out, “HELLO?”
A man about my age walked through the door, I didn’t recognize him as a regular, he had a long, thin face and muddy brown hair, like a mop it was everywhere as if he didn’t know what a brush was. He wore a hoodie that ironically had Sammy from Wayside School printed on the front of it, I smiled after reading the previous comments on a post I made online about my experience about Sweeper. 

He held up one hand, “hi there, I’m looking for an Arlen.” He flicked his eyes between the two of us, knowing full well I was the one he was looking for, but the worried look on his face said he wasn’t exactly sure if I was the one he was actually looking for. His green eyes were filled with innocence that I nearly lied to him. 

I hesitated for a moment, uncertain about giving myself away to a stranger. The way he lingered in the doorway, almost afraid to step fully into the fluorescent light, made me even more cautious. Tommi glanced up from his sketchbook, eyebrows raised, sensing my uncertainty but saying nothing. There was a quiet tension in the air as I finally replied, “That’s me, Arlen. What brings you here?”

Like a dog he instantly perked up, and he smiled so wide I was afraid it might crack his whole face open. “Oh good! I’m Daren Huckabee, I’m the new hire or transfer however you want to put it, it’s great to meet you. I heard you needed someone to help you at the overnight shift, so I volunteered—”

I zoned out from listening to him drone on. His voice blended with the hum of the ceiling lights, and for a moment I was more focused on the rhythm of me putting lids into the small shelf next to the cup dispensers than the words pouring out of his mouth. Still, I caught bits and pieces—mentions of previous jobs, how he was “great with late hours,” and something about being able to handle weird situations. I wondered if he’d still be so upbeat after a week here, especially if he ran into Sweeper or any of the strange regulars who wandered in at 3 AM.

Finally, after he stopped talking, I reached over and shook his hand. “Nice to meet you Daren,” I said going back to stalking the lids. “You know how to clock in, right?” 

He ran his hand through his hair, “it’s the same system I assume.” 
I nodded and he walked towards the office in the back of the store, and I glanced over at Tommi who was now grinning. His long black hair fell down his shoulders in waves as he pulled a hair tie off his wrist and tied his hair back with a grin. “Looks like a good guy.” He snarked. 

I shrugged, not ready to form an opinion just yet. “We’ll see,” I muttered, grabbing a stack of receipt paper and pretending to be busy. The shop always had a way of revealing people’s true colors after a couple of graveyard shifts. Tommi just chuckled and bent back over his sketchbook, shading in the lines with the ease of someone who’s made peace with the night. 

He claims he just comes here to sketch and unwind, but I know better—he’s hiding out, letting the buzz of my store drown out whatever daytime noise he’s avoiding. Still, his presence is oddly comforting, like an anchor when the long hours threaten to blur together. Even on the slowest nights, having someone else share the quiet helps the time slip by a little faster.

Daren’s footsteps were loud, like sneakers squeaking on clean tiled floors, it was irritating, he had pulled his hoodie off and now as wearing our store’s uniform shirt. Which was a dark maroon color with our logo in black lettering on the right chest side. “I’m all clocked in, are you one of the regulars, here?” he glanced over at Tommi sketching. 

Tommi didn’t even look up from his sketchbook, a sly grin spreading across his face. “Oh, I’m just part of the furniture. They keep me around for ambiance,” he replied, his tone light but unmistakably teasing. “If you stay long enough, you might earn your spot on the shelf too.”

Daren laughed at him, and I rolled my eyes, glancing at the clock on the wall, I knew rush hour was going to start, or more like dinner rush. It was about that time when people were either heading home or going on their overnight shifts. The cars that zoomed past out by the highway were getting a little more traffic than usual. 

“I’m giving you a fair warning, Daren, working overnight here is a bit weirder than any other place you’ve probably worked.” I said as I walked around the counter with Daren on my heels. 

He smirked, a mix of curiosity and skepticism flickering across his face. “Weird, huh? Like, haunted soda machine weird, or just customers who talk to mannequins?” His attempt at humor was decent, but I could tell he was sizing up the place, noticing every odd detail as he followed me. 

I gestured toward the front windows, where the neon reflected off the glass in distorted shapes. “Let’s just say, you’ll see things here that don’t make sense anywhere else,” I replied, letting the mystery hang in the air between us. “Here, soon Sweeper will be in the parking lot don’t mind him, all he does is sweep.” And remembering that ‘he’ in general was just a bunch of rats in a trench coat. 

Daren furrowed his brow, clearly unsure if I was joking, but the gleam in his eye suggested he was up for whatever oddities the night might bring. The neon glow made his freshly donned uniform look almost burgundy, and the hum of the store grew a little louder as the first customers trickled in, bringing with them the unpredictable energy of the night shift.

Every gas station clerk has their weird regular, besides Tommi who likes to regularly hide out here. There is the one woman who was about to come in. she walks with a limp and had has a lazy eye, she always looks like she crawled out of a dumpster, but I learned quickly not to stare for far too long. Because that lazy eye of her moves on its own, it creeps me out. 

Gina walked through the door, “Hey there Gina,” I said as she limped passed us. “This is Daren, he’s going to be working with me for now on.” 

She grunted her usual greeting, barely glancing at Daren as she made her way toward the back coolers. There was a faint scent of cigarettes trailing behind her, mixing with the tang of cleaning solution and old coffee lingering in the air. Daren watched her for a moment, clearly intrigued but also doing his best not to stare, picking up quickly on the unspoken rules for dealing with the night’s cast of characters.

I leaned toward him, “That’s Gina, don’t stare at her lazy eye,” I whispered. 
Daren leaned back towards me, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “So, should I introduce myself to the lazy eye too, or would that be staring?” He flashed an awkward grin, clearly trying to lighten the mood despite the odd tension. I snorted, shaking my head, unable to help a small smile at his persistent attempts at humor.

“The lazy eye moves on its own, just trust me, don’t look at it,” I warned him. The jingle on the door rang out and I turned to see Peter walking through. “Pete, don’t make another mess at the icee machine again, my floors are supposed to be clean not sticky.” I scolded the old man. 

Peter shuffled in with his usual half-smile, one hand clutching a plastic grocery bag and the other already reaching for the Icee lever as if drawn by muscle memory. He wore his faded denim jacket tonight; the collar turned up against a chill that seemed more psychological than physical. 

Daren gave me a sidelong glance, silently confirming that Peter was another one of the regulars I’d warned him about. The old man just grunted, not even bothering to respond as he started the ritual of filling his cup—inevitably spilling a bright slush on the tile. It was all part of the nightly routine, one that Daren was quickly realizing came with its own strange rhythm.

As the night dragged on, it didn’t seem like the weird stuff wasn’t going to happen, even Sweeper in the distance was do his usual nightly ritual by the pumps. Tommi had long gone left after a couple of hours sketching and telling Daren not to die on his first shift. Daren went pale when he heard him joke about it, I’d told Daren there had been work related accidents on the job in the pass or so I had heard. After all I’m still a new employee too, but working the overnight shift has hardened me real quick. 

That is until about 3 a.m. came around, the weird started to act up. I was in the cooler putting the cold drinks on the shelf, I was bundled up in a hoodie when I heard the door jingle, and briefly heard Daren greet the customer. My hands were trembling from how cold it was in the cooler. I left Daren on his own, figuring if he knew how to do his job, surely, he wouldn’t be stupid enough to break the rules. I had shown the rules for overnight crew to follow, he read them and asked if I was joking. 

I told him I wish I was joking, but I wasn’t. The stories from the overnight shift weren’t just weird, they were the kind you couldn’t make up, and even I hadn’t gotten used to them yet. Daren’s eyes widened as he realized I was dead serious, and for a moment, the chill from the cooler felt even sharper.
There was a knocking coming from the freezer door and a small voice calling out for help, I learned quickly to ignore the pleas of the ghost who wanted out of the freezer. When it first happened to me, I almost never went near the cooler ever again. But know I tune it out, as the knocks became rhythmic. “Shut it, I’m trying to work,” I hissed at the knocking. 

Sometimes, I swear the knocks almost line up with the ticking of the clock, as if the ghost is keeping time with us out here. It’s become just another sound in the background—like the hum of the cooler fans or the distant thuds of Sweeper’s broom against the pavement. Daren hasn’t experienced it yet, but I know it’s only a matter of time before he hears it himself and asks me about the freezer door.

That is until I heard screaming from out on the floor, it sounded like Daren. I dropped the last can onto the shelf and rushed out of the cooler, my heart pounding in my chest. The store lights flickered overhead as I hurried toward the front, half-expecting to see Daren tangled up in some mess or maybe facing one of the regulars in a panic. 

But as I rounded the corner, what I saw made me stop dead in my tracks—a shadow stretched long across the sticky tile, darker than anything I'd ever seen inside these walls. Daren stood frozen, mouth open, eyes wide in terror, while the shadow inched closer, somehow twisting and shifting against the bright fluorescent glare.

The shadow moved with no human body around; Daren was on the counter as if he was witnessing a rat running around the store. I held my hand to my chest, “you scared the shit out of me, damn it, Daren!”

He pointed at the moving shadow that shot across the store through the aisles, packages of candy fluttering as if it did so. “The—the— hell is that?!”
“it’s a shadow, what do you think it is,” I pushed my hair back from my forehead.

Daren shook his head, trying to process what he’d just seen. “No, man, that thing wasn’t normal. Shadows don’t just move like that,” he stammered, voice barely above a whisper. I glanced back at the aisle, watching the last pieces of candy settle, and couldn’t help but feel a chill creep up my spine. There were plenty of explanations for strange happenings on the overnight shift, but some things just never got any easier to explain.

“It isn’t going to hurt you unless you hurt it first,” I sighed. It was true, a shadow likes coming in here and going to the candy aisle how a shadow could eat candy was beyond me. but it comes in once in a while, although I can’t fault Daren for acting the way he did, when it first happened to me, I ignored it and told myself its not real. 

Looking back now, I wish someone had warned me just how weird things could get on the graveyard shift. You think you’ve seen it all until the unexplainable start creeping into your routine, turning a simple stocking job into a test of nerves. Daren’s reaction was a reminder that, no matter how often I told myself these things were normal, deep down, they still unsettled me just as much. The night wasn’t done with us yet, and I had a feeling it would get stranger before sunrise.

That is until we heard a banging noise in the backroom, Daren stared at me like a deer in headlights. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he whispered, his voice trembling. I could tell he was hoping I’d say it was just the pipes or maybe someone dropping a box, but I didn’t have any easy answers. The sound was too deliberate, too heavy, almost like something wanted to announce its presence. We exchanged a look, silently daring each other to go check it out, but neither of us moved at first, waiting for the noise to come again.

Then, suddenly, I heard a weird skittering noise that made me freeze. I glanced over, expecting a mouse or maybe a stray piece of plastic, but instead, I saw a mustache—just a mustache—walking on its own across the floor. It wiggled purposefully, its ends twitching like little insect legs as it made its way under a shelf and disappeared into the shadows. For a moment, neither of us knew what to say, just staring at the spot where it vanished, each silently questioning our grip on reality.

“Well, that’s new,” I said. 

Daren shook his head, “did we just see a—”

Before Daren could finish, the mustache reappeared, crawling out from beneath the shelf with even more urgency. Its bristly ends quivered as it scuttled across the linoleum, heading straight for us. I instinctively took a step back while Daren froze, eyes wide as the mustache darted closer, almost as if it had chosen its next target.

I reached for a broom Daren had conveniently left by the counter, as it leapt in the air after me, I grabbed the handle of the broom and used it like a baseball bat and smacked the mustache across the store. It smacked right into a shelf filled with peanuts, scattering the packages across the floor. The Mustache looked dazed as it wobbled, the ends of it trembling. 

For a second, I thought that was the end of it. But the mustache shook itself, regaining its composure with a strange, determined energy. Daren let out a nervous laugh—high-pitched and shaky—while I kept the broom raised, not sure if I was more afraid or amused. The whole situation felt unreal. We exchanged a look that told me he was just as lost as I was, but neither of us was willing to let our guard down just yet.

Just then a man walked inside the store, he looked at me strangely wielding a broom and Daren who was still clearly on the counter like a frightened little girl. “Is there a rat in the store or something—”

The mustache, apparently emboldened by its previous antics, suddenly flung itself at me. I ducked just in time, feeling the rush of air as it sailed passed my face—and before anyone could react, it smacked right into the customer’s face. The man stumbled back, his eyes wide in shock as the mustache latched on, wriggling furiously across his upper lip while he sputtered in disbelief.

The whole scene felt frozen for a moment, like we were watching some twisted magic trick. The man clawed at his face, trying to pry the mustache off, but it clung tight, its wiry hairs writhing as if determined to stay put. Daren scrambled down from the counter, finally finding his voice. “Sir, you might want to—uh—hold still!” he stammered, powerless to explain as the mustache seemed to settle, curling perfectly into place as if it belonged there all along.

We all just stared, speechless. The man blinked several times, then slowly ran his finger over the new facial addition, as if testing whether it was actually real. Daren and I exchanged glances, unsure if we should try to intervene or if this was simply beyond our pay grade. The mustache seemed to have calmed down, perfectly content with its new host, while the man looked more confused than alarmed, searching our faces for any hint of explanation.

But it was no longer the man in control; you could see his mouth twitching and lips moving as if he were trying to speak, yet every expression was dictated by the mustache’s odd, animating force. For a moment, his eyes flashed with panic, but then his features settled into a strange, mustachioed calm, as if the mustache had claimed him as its own.

The awkward silence hung in the air, broken only by the faint hum of the store’s refrigerator. I tightened my grip on the broom, not entirely sure what the protocol was for sentient facial hair emergencies. Finally, the man—now sporting the rogue mustache—gave a hesitant, almost involuntary smile. 

It looked like the mustache was puppeteering his expressions, twisting the corners of his mouth into shapes none of us had ever seen. Daren leaned closer, whispering, “Is it... safe now?” I shrugged, unable to answer, as we watched our newest customer morph into something equally comical and unsettling right before our eyes.

The man began to speak, but the words that came out didn’t sound like his own. His voice took on a peculiar cadence—half whisper, half theatrical flourish—almost as if the mustache was trying out language for the first time. “Greetings, humble mortals,” he intoned, his lips moving stiffly in time with the mustache’s subtle twitches. Daren and I exchanged alarmed glances, realizing that whatever was speaking through him was definitely not the man we’d seen walk in just moments before.

I stayed quiet, gripping the broom a little tighter, unsure if any response would only encourage whatever bizarre force had taken hold. Daren, on the other hand, cleared his throat and forced a shaky smile, as if determined to maintain some semblance of customer service. “Uh, welcome to the store!” he said, his voice wavering just a bit too high. “Can I, um, help you find anything today?” The mustached man’s lips curled into a dramatic grin, and for a heartbeat, I wondered if Daren’s attempt at normalcy would make things better—or much, much weirder.

The mustached man’s grin widened, the hairs twitching with mischievous intent. He leaned in ever so slightly, and in that same odd, theatrical cadence, intoned, “Your soul.” The words hung heavily between us, absurd and chilling at once, making Daren take an involuntary step back. For a split second, I thought he might be joking—but the way the mustache seemed to bristle made me wonder if it was only half in jest, and entirely in control.

If either of us made a move I knew something was going to happen. I remembered rule number eight: never touch anything that moves on its own. My heart thudded in my chest as I tried to recall the rest of the emergency manual—though, admittedly, it had never covered haunted mustaches before. Daren looked just as tense, his eyes darting from me to the mustached man, both of us frozen by the absurdity—and danger—of the moment.

The man’s eyes narrowed on us, and the dazzling theatrical smile it had been displaying on the man’s face, turned into a scowl. “Mortals are not as fun these days are they.” His tone took on a more sinister edge now, the mustache curling into shapes that seemed almost threatening. The fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting strange shadows across his face. Daren gripped a nearby display of candy bars, as if they might offer some sort of protection. I steadied myself, determined not to let fear show, even as the mustache’s sinister energy filled the tiny store.

A tense silence settled over us as the mustache seemed to almost vibrate with anticipation. I glanced at the door, wondering if an escape would trigger another attack, but the mustached man blocked the way with an unsettling, deliberate step. The air felt thick, charged with the possibility that anything could happen next. I swallowed hard and tried to steady my nerves, silently hoping that the bizarre entity would tire of its performance and give us a chance to restore some kind of normalcy—if that was even possible anymore.

“I don’t know what you are,” I said firmly. “But you are not welcomed in this store.” 

The mustache twitched as if considering my words, then contorted itself into an exaggerated frown. For a brief moment, the man's body stiffened, as though fighting for control. The atmosphere felt electric—charged both with fear and a strange, hypnotic curiosity. Daren edged a little closer to me, his hand still hovering protectively near the candy bars, while I kept my gaze locked on the mustached man, refusing to back down.

“That’s a shame,” he said as the man’s head tilted. 

For a heartbeat, the mustache drooped, quivering as if stung by rejection. The man’s fingers flexed at his sides, caught in the silent struggle between his own will and the mustache’s eerie dominance. A strange, shimmering chill seemed to ripple through the store, making the rows of cans and snacks tremble imperceptibly. In that pregnant pause, I wondered if my defiance would provoke the entity—or finally convince it to leave us be.

My job was cut and clean to make sure the store runs without any issues, keep the store clean and efficient, there was nothing that was said I had to help customers who ended up in this predicament. But in my peripheral vision I could see Daren wanting to help the man, and seeing him grabbing candy bars, I wasn’t sure how that was going to help the situation at all. 

Yet even as I tried to stick to the job description, the sense of responsibility tugged at me—maybe not for the mustached man, but for Daren, who was clearly out of his depth. I took a steady breath and tried to think fast, scanning the shelves for anything that could serve as a distraction or deterrent. The store felt smaller than ever, squeezed by the supernatural tension, but I knew we had to do something before the mustache made its next move.

Just as I predicted, Daren hurled the fistful of candy bars straight at the mustache controlling the man. The wrappers spun through the air, scattering across the linoleum with a chaotic clatter. For a moment, the mustache recoiled, its bristling form rippling in apparent surprise, and the man staggered back as if the sugary projectiles had broken the entity’s concentration. The absurdity of the assault hung in the air, but the distraction was just enough to break the tension—and Daren in all his stupidity, leapt at the man. 

Panic shot through me as Daren collided with the man, both of them tumbling awkwardly into a rack of potato chips. I dropped the broom and rushed forward, unsure whether to pull Daren away or help pin down the mustached man. The mustache writhed furiously, its ends flaring outward like the legs of some monstrous insect, and for a split second, I thought I saw sparks flicker in its twisted curls.

Summoning every ounce of courage, I grabbed the nearest item—a bottle of soda—and prepared to jump in. The stakes were suddenly real, the line between the absurd and the terrifying blurring with every frantic heartbeat. All that mattered now was stopping the mustache before it regained control—or before Daren got himself seriously hurt.

Without thinking, I lunged forward, the bottle of soda held high like a shield. The mustache lashed toward me, its wiry hairs whistling inches from my face, but I swung the bottle in a wide arc, splashing fizzy liquid across the man's chest and the pulsating mass above his lip. The mustache shrieked—not with sound, but with a visceral, vibrating energy that rattled the shelves and sent shivers through my bones. I could only hope the chaos would be enough to loosen its grip, if only for a moment.

That shot of energy threw Daren across the store, slamming his head on the table and he passed out, a huge cut on his forehead, and blood started to trickle down his face. My heart hammered in my chest, torn between rushing to Daren’s side and keeping my guard up against the writhing mustache. The mustached man crumpled to his knees, hands clutching his head as the entity spasmed, struggling to regain coherence. I took that distraction and ran to Daren’s side.  

The pulsation of the energy shot through the store again, the man tried to rip the mustache off his face, as its tendrils kept latched but I noticed the soda I had used was making it hard for the mustache to stay on the mans face. I blinked, as a realization came to my mind. Soda? 

Maybe it wasn’t just the force of my swing, but something in the soda itself—a hidden ingredient that made the mustache recoil more violently than before. I mean soda is used to clean toilets for God sake. I glanced at the label, half-expecting to find some clue, but all I could see was the usual list: sugar, caffeine, carbonated water. 

Still, the fizz seemed to eat away at the supernatural threads clinging to the man’s skin. My mind raced, searching for other quick solutions—Could I douse the mustache again before it regrouped?

I looked at the display of bottled glass soda like the one I used; it took me hours to make that display. I groaned in irritation. This was way above my pay grade. But still. “Daren you still with me?” I asked gently. 

Daren groaned from the pain. Seeing he was fine, I ran to the glass bottled soda display, my footsteps echoing in the suddenly tense silence. With shaking hands, I grabbed as many bottles as I could, determined to use whatever edge I had against the mustache's relentless grip. 

I ran toward the man, my arms full of glass soda bottles, adrenaline fueling each desperate step. Fumbling with the caps, I managed to pop one open and splashed its contents directly onto his face, the sticky, fizzing liquid drenching both the man and the writhing mustache. He clawed at his upper lip, fingers trembling as the mustache sizzled and recoiled from the fresh wave of soda. 

For a heartbeat, the mustache seemed to shrink, its wiry tendrils curling inward as if retreating from the onslaught of fizz. The air filled with the sharp scent of soda, mingling with the metallic tang of adrenaline and blood. The man gasped, his eyes wild, as the mustache loosened its grip, leaving angry red marks across his skin. Who knew that the soda filled with chemical poison, we like to drink is taking out a supernatural mustache. 

Desperate for anything that might help, I grabbed the tip jar off the counter by the register, its weight reassuring in my trembling hands. I unscrewed the lid and dumped the dollars and coins on the counter and slammed it over the mustache and sealed it into the jar. 

For a moment, everything seemed to freeze—the mustache pressed against the glass, writhing and thrashing in a frenzy, unable to escape. The jar vibrated in my hands as if the thing inside was testing the limits, but it held firm. I twisted the lid tighter, praying that would be enough to keep the entity contained until we figured out what to do next. My breath came in ragged gasps, relief and disbelief mingling as the immediate danger was finally contained.

I ended up calling for an ambulance, my hands still trembling as I pressed the buttons, barely able to string together a coherent sentence. Of course, the cops showed up soon after, their sirens slicing through the night air. I had to think fast, cobbling together a realistic story about a shelf collapsing and Daren getting caught in chaos and the customer who was now traumatized couldn’t string sentences coherently, I lied about him witnessing the whole thing. I left out the part about the sentient mustache and the supernatural struggle—after all, who would believe that?

As paramedics tended to Daren, I kept my answers simple, focusing on the confusion and panic, glossing over any details that might invite suspicion. The officers eyed the broken bottles, the sticky floor, and not seeing the glass jar with the mustache now tucked safely behind the counter but seemed satisfied with my explanation. 

I replayed the encounter over and over in my head, wondering how long my story would hold up—and what on earth I was supposed to do with the thing trapped in that jar behind the counter. 

Of course I had to clean the mess up, Daren and the customer were taken to the hospital, and for Daren’s first shift here, honestly, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it could’ve been. Sure, there was broken glass and drank soda everywhere, but at least everyone was alive, and the mustache was contained. As I mopped up the sticky soda and swept away the shards, I couldn’t help but laugh a little at the absurdity of it all—just another night at the store, right?

Until one of the glass bottles fell from the display and I nearly jumped out of my own skin, echoing off the polished linoleum. My nerves were shot, and for a split second, I thought the mustache had somehow escaped. Heart pounding, I checked the jar—still sealed, the twisted thing pressed against the glass. I let out a shaky breath, forcing myself to relax, even as my eyes darted anxiously around the store. The quiet seemed loaded now, every small sound magnified by my lingering fear and disbelief.

I'll be in New Mexico for about 48 hours from midday Nov. 15 to Nov. 17. My intention was to just go to Albuquerque, but my sister told me I have to go to Santa Fe, so I was planning on driving straight there from the airport, staying one night, and returning to Albuquerque the next day and staying for a night.

Now that I've looked up things to do in Albuquerque, though, it seems like two days would barely be enough for Albuquerque alone. My first question is, am I right? I love hiking and history and native culture, southwestern architecture and desert landscape, breweries and coffee shops, and want to run somewhere where I could see very New-Mexico things. Is trying to accomplish all this plus driving back and forth to Santa Fe too much? Or is Santa Fe an absolute must see while I'm there?  
  
My second question is about a hotel. I'm a woman traveling alone. I'm trying to book using credit card points, and, therefore, have limited options. These are the hotels I'm trying to decide between:

Old Town: TownPlace Old Town 

North: TownPlace (5511 Office Boulevard NE)

Uptown: Sheraton, Element, Fairfield, or TownPlace

I'd love to be able to walk out of my hotel and just have things to do - including run if I could see some cool historical sites or architecture -  but again, I'm a woman traveling by myself. Recommendations? Thank you in advance!

1o4tiww,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Wifefoot2share/comments/1o4tiww/friend_finds_my_wifes_feet_irresistible_full_story/,Friend finds my wife's feet irresistible! FULL STORY!,"Once I was sitting on the couch in our apartment with my wife and a friend of mine. I was in the middle, and we were playing an interactive TV game, so we all had to be able to see the TV which is why we were crowded on the sofa. We were having some drinks, too, sitting in front of us on a coffee table which ran the length of the couch. Getting comfortable and wanting her body to point toward the direction of the TV, my wife turned, laying her back against the arm rest, with her bare naked feet on my thighs.  
  
Her feet are a size 6 with toes that descend across at such a perfect angle that you could put a ruler across her round toe tips. She has nice deep nail beds and her tiny toes were painted a man-attracting hot pink. She had been doing some yoga that particular day and so had some foot jewellery strapped around her lovely ankles and adorning the tops of her feet with beads and flowers ending with ribbon gently wrapped around her dainty second toes. I put my hand across her feet and then slid my fingers under the nice high arch of her right foot. When my friend wasn't looking I cupped her toes and slid my fingers along her soles feeling their perfection with absolutely not a single bit of dry skin, just sexy softness. I cupped and released her smooth thin heel while my friend glanced down at my fun.  
  
When my friend wasn't playing, I kept noticing him glancing at my wife's feet too. While he was playing I would touch her feet and actually push them forward higher on my left thigh and closer to him just to see his reaction. As a foot guy, I know there are millions and millions of us hiding our foot love, so trying to expose a foot lover was a bit of a hobby of mine. Like most women, my wife had no foot awareness so foot fun was just being interpreted as playful teasing.  
  
Her toes were now very close to his thighs, peeking out over my leg her arches now right on top of my thighs. I could see him moving his right thigh closer to her exposed pink toes, making contact and then moving his thigh back. Several times when he got up to get a drink he brushed his hand across her toes which gave me a huge lump in my throat and made me very horny. Eventually, my wife's knees were bothering her, so she stretched her legs out. Now her feet were across his thighs and her knees over my lap. She said, ""Sorry Ralph, I had to stretch."" But as she was going to move them back he held them in place and told it it was fine. Relaxing now, she crossed her feet at the ankle and in a welcoming way he casually put his right hand over her top foot and began rubbing her arch with his thumb.  
  
It was my turn while this was going on so I couldn't fully watch, just glances from of my peripheral vision as I tried hopelessly to concentrate on the game. When my turn ended, it was the wife's turn. Ralph had to get up and doing so he hugged her feet tightly to his chest as he began to get up with what I suspect was a hard-on. He turned and placed her feet gently on his seat on the sofa before he went to the bathroom.  
  
After returning from the bathroom, I could see my buddy enter the room with his eyes happily glued on her feet which were right where he had left them. When she noticed him about to take his seat she pulled her feet back to give him room to sit.  
  
As she positioned her feet back on my thighs again, I cupped her right heel and pushed it up so her toes began sliding towards my friend. Now familiar with being allowed to touch Michelle's little feet, he lovingly held her right foot and guided it to rest once again on his legs. He didn't remove his hand either and wrapped his palm around her toes - making them disappear - and was stroking her undertoes with his fingers.  
  
She let him play with her foot for a few minutes, but pulled her right foot back shyly thinking these two men were having a little too much fun with her feet I suppose. Nothing was ever uttered about the incident. We all just acted like it was just something casual for her pleasure alone.  
  
Anyway, as we got a little drunker, he asked about her toenail color. She flirtingly pointed her toes towards him, and he touched them and guided the tiny foot to his face to get a better look at the sparkly toes. I began tickling her other foot slowly, and so he began tickling her right foot. Suddenly my drunken friend reached down with his mouth, and bit the tip of her big toe playfully between his teeth while we continued tickling her. She pulled her toe out of his mouth and began squirming and twisting.  
  
We released her just seconds later, and then she got up as it was her turn to go to the bathroom. The evening ended soon after but it is burned forever in my memory.

1o4ti7h,https://i.redd.it/9wxy8759jpuf1.jpeg,Blame Martin Instead So We Don't Spoil 'THE' Chiz,"Every time Senator Chiz Escudero opens his mouth lately, you can bet one thing’s coming, it’s Martin Romualdez’s fault. 

Flood control issues? Martin. 
Budget insertions? Martin. 
The bicam mess? Definitely Martin. 

If the coffee machine breaks in the Senate lounge, don’t be surprised if Chiz blames the former Speaker too.

It’s a blame game so consistent it’s almost impressive, if only it came with evidence. Because for all his sharp words and lawyerly flourish, Escudero has yet to show a single shred of proof linking Martin Romualdez to the budget controversies he keeps hinting at. Not one document. Not one signature. Not even a whisper from the bicam minutes.

In fact, here’s what the record actually shows, Romualdez didn’t even sign the bicam report. That’s the truth Chiz conveniently skips every time he grandstands about “transparency” and “accountability.” The final budget maneuvers? They happened under the Senate’s watch, yes, the same Senate where Escudero himself played a leading role.

So why the nonstop finger-pointing? Simple. Diversion. When your fingerprints are on the process that turned the NEP into a political wish list, you find someone else to blame. And who better than the former Speaker? He’s powerful, visible, and easy to paint as the villain.

But the more Chiz talks, the more it looks like projection. Because behind the theatrics is a senator desperate to deflect attention from his own handiwork in the bicam -- the late-night adjustments, the quiet allocations, the things that mysteriously appeared between committee discussions and the final version.

It’s classic Escudero, charm the cameras, spin the story, and hope no one looks too closely at the receipts. He’s mastered the art of the soundbite but forgotten the importance of substance. Every accusation that collapses under scrutiny chips away at what’s left of his credibility.

And Filipinos are catching on. We’ve seen this play before, the politician who cries corruption the loudest while hoping no one checks who was really holding the pen.

Let’s be clear, Martin Romualdez has been accused of everything except changing the weather. But when you strip away the noise, there’s nothing, no proof, no signature, no act tying him to the so-called “insertions” Escudero keeps dramatizing.

If Escudero really stands for accountability, maybe he should start by accounting for his own role in the bicam. Because the truth is stubborn, you can’t keep blaming the man who didn’t even sign the document.

At this point, Chiz’s routine isn’t just tired, it’s transparent. Every speech, every accusation, every sly innuendo feels less like statesmanship and more like a cover-up disguised as moral outrage.

So the next time Senator Escudero points his finger at Martin Romualdez, remember this: a man so obsessed with finding a scapegoat usually has something of his own to hide. The real question now isn’t what Romualdez did, it’s what Chiz is so desperate to make us forget. 🤫",1,1760286411.0,PilipinasUnfiltered,0,1.0,False

I'm hoping to make 100-120 drinks a day on average. We have a pretty efficient setup and most drinks on our menu require about 8oz of milk. We do have alternative milk options but they don't need refrigerated space in storage.

When we started this venture in January, my wife and I had absolutely zero experience in coffee. We bought a milk cooler back then that can store 8 crates (6 half gallons each). Our total refrigerated storage provides enough space for about 55 half gallons. Judging by the math. That'll only last us a few days.

Which leads me to my question for shops that do around that volume, or those who have a solid idea on their numbers. I know it varies, but what is a safe number (gallons of milk) that will get you through a medium average week of coffee sales?",2,1760286333.0,Coffee_Shop,0,1.0,False

“Eca! How fortunate to see you here!” Seli smiled

“It's been a while. Are you buying Beast Tamer formula?” Eli smiled in return

“Buying is a generous word,” Seli said while looking a bit down

“Hmm? What's wrong?” Eli asked in concern

“Ah, is not a problem! I merely have to gather some funding, but till then, I am merely seeing what offers are available.” Seli answered 

“Oh, you see, I just bought the formula myself, we can share it.” Eli happily told her

“Hm? How gracious! Praise the crimson moon! And what would it cost?” Seli’s face brightened

“How about we meet again, outside of the gray fog?” Eli suggested

“Hm? Ah, of course, but that can simply be arranged without the exchange. A simple meeting is worth far less than a formula. Should I prepare to bring cash?” Seli asked in enthusiasm

“You can pay however much you want. I'll even give it to you for free.” Eli smiled

Seli raises an eyebrow. “How... intriguing. It seems like this meeting is of vital importance. Then how about the Shining Star Cafe tomorrow afternoon?”

“Very well, see you, my dear friend Moon chaser, Praise the Crimson Moon.” Eli smiled calculatively

“Praise the moon!” Seli reciprocated

After talking with Seli, she now goes to find some other deal she can make 

A man said, “Revolvers for sale. 4 in total, priced at 40 pounds” 

*Oh, a gun, I am indeed in need of some offensive weapon.* “I would like to buy one. And how about the bullet?”

“I don’t currently have bullets, but I might be selling in the future.” He said

“Not even regular ones?” She asked

“I don’t currently have bullets, but I might be selling in the future,” He answerdd

“I see.” *This should be the same man from Caelastria…* She thought

“Then is the deal fine with you?” The man asks to confirm

It's cheaper than the other gun. “Well, if you could sell me some bullets next time.” She said

“I will be on the lookout for some. If there are any special bullets you are interested in, I can attempt to acquire those as well.” He told her

“That would be very much appreciated.” She replied

Not much more trade happens that day, she returned to the world below, waiting for her meeting with Moonchaser or Selinia

—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eli walked into the cafe, which looked to be very homey and comfortable, nothing too special. She sat down and ordered a drink, waiting for Seli to come

It doesn't take long until Selinia walks in, lugging around a satchel too large for her. It weighs heavily in her arms, and there is the occasional clinking sound resounding from it. Almost immediately, she sees Eli. She opens her mouth, ready to praise the moon, before halting. There are people around, and they were the unenlightened who refused her blessing. With Caelastria's ban on religion, she has to be cautious in public. “Elizabeth!” She called. Sliding into a chair, she orders 2 cups of coffee. “Or shall I call you Eca?”

*Oh, interesting, is she trying to tease me, or test me?* “Both is fine, Seli, we're not in the gray fog, why bother letting them know of our codename up there?” She lowered her voice to make sure no one heard it.

“I was simply curious about the code name. Mine is self-explanatory, but where does Eca come from?” She asked inquisitively

*Mere curiosity?* “You see, my full legal name is Elizabeth Carmilla Athanasia von Edelweiss, so ECAvE, Eca,” She answered truthfully.

Selinia raises her eyebrows but doesn't comment on it, “So? What's this about?”

“You see, we're fellows from the same era, not belonging to this one” *wait... doesn't belong to this era? Surely it's just a coincidence* “In this new world, what do you need the most? Allies”

“And what makes you think I would be a good ally? What makes me trustworthy in your eyes? We've only met once after all. Is that truly worth 400 pounds?” She asked interrogatively.

*My motive, huh?* “I don't trust you fully, nor do I trust anyone fully.” *After all, the only one I truly trust is no longer here* “But, I have to find an ally, and who's a better ally than those who have worked together? From that short moment we worked together, it's pretty easy to judge one's character, don't you think so?”

It's still hard for Selinia to separate A̶̛͒͆̓r̶͐̓̔̄u̸͊̌̌̈́n̶͂̊̎̋â̷͂́̕L̶͌̋̓̚ï̸̆̚͝l̵ith from the girl in front of her. Those red eyes are simply too similar. But she pushes away the feelings of yearning, agony, and despair. *because Eli is not h̶̤̣̤͊e̵̥̓̿̇r̶̀̊̏̍. I have to revive h̶̤̣̤͊e̵̥̓̿̇r̶̀̊̏̍. But this was a step towards advancement. and a step towards reviving h̶̤̣̤͊e̵̥̓̿̇r̶̀̊̏̍. * “I see... then what does such a cooperation entail?”

“Working together, of course, sharing knowledge, sharing formulas, it's a cooperation between the two of us, not as partners, but as friends,” Eli asked hopefully. “Perhaps the time will come when we need to do something, and we can help each other out.”

“As friends... well, as friends, I can't allow myself to take the potion formula for free.” Opening the satchel, she shows the messy pile of coins and notes sitting in there. “It should be roughly 100 pounds. It's all I can spare for now.”

Eli looks at the money, it was certainly not enough to buy a formula regularly, but she thought *Honourable* “Very well, once again, nice meeting you, Seli” she said as she pushed a piece of paper towards her.

“May I call you Eli?” Seli asked

“Naturally, have I not been calling you Seli? There's no need for excessive formality.” Eli answered while sipping her coffee.

She looks down at the beast master formula briefly before flipping it over and pulling out a pen. Scrawling messily on the back, Selinia holds it up and shows it to her. It reads ""praise the moon!""

Eli reciprocated and wrote ""praise the moon.""

—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eli arrived at Caelastria’s Auction. She browsed some items she could buy, *Auction, huh, there's not much that I can buy. Maybe I could get Vampire formula and characteristics in the gray fog, hmm.*

Looking at the items on the list, A man spots his next formula. But he doesn't have enough money. “Is anyone able to lend me 222 pounds? In return, I will share the formula I intend to buy and will pay back the remaining 22 pounds.”

Eli overheard this voice, recognizing it immediately, it's the gun-selling man, so she approached him and tapped his shoulder, “Gray fog?”

“Huh?” He is surprised to be recognized but quickly remembers the voice as well: “Yeah, you bought one, right?”

“It's quite surprising, I didn't expect to meet someone else from the same era this fast,” Eli smiled

“Likewise. Say, is there any way you can help?” He asked

“I have money,” She answered

“Thank you!” He beams with a smile, “So, is it fine if I repay the 22 pounds at a later date?”

“Hmm, I will lend you 300 pounds in case someone else bids them, return them later, surely you will uphold a deal with your future customer, won't you?” She asked

“Of course! And if you have any specific commissions, you can also ask me here,” He answered

*Perfect, one new possible ally,* she thought as the man bid 700 pounds for the formula.

After thinking for a bit, she said, “I'd like to buy some special bullets next time.”

“Any specific bullet?” He asked

“I want bullets with varieties of effects, like purification, demon hunting, and maybe ice bullets.” She answers

“I will try my utmost to create those bullets, dear customer, just after I find how to get the materials first,” He replied

“You don't have to be so formal,” She complained

“hehe, it's a habit by now.” He replied

Nothing interesting happens in the auction, the man won the bid as no one else are even interested 

“That auction went pretty smoothly, huh?” Eli looked at the man, “Oh, have we introduced ourselves yet? You can call me Eli, but up there, call me Eca.”

“Nice to meet you, Eli. My name is Cyril.” Taking out the formula, he hands the paper over to her, “Here, as part of the payment for the loan.”

Eli takes the paper, “Not going to tell me what to call you up there?”

“Cyril works as well. My old name was Daed, but both work,” Cyril replied

“I see, well, nice to meet you, Cyril. You did say that you could probably fetch me some bullets, right? Do you have any more details on that?” She asked

“The pricing will mostly depend on the material cost, but I didn't have a chance to look at those yet. I do know how to create some special bullets already as well.” He answered

“Would it be possible to preorder the bullets?” Eli asked another question

“Of course, is there a specific kind you want?” Using Recall, Cyril remembers some of the special bullets used by the church: “I currently now how to produce demon hunting bullets, purifying bullets, poison, and weakening bullets as well.”

“How much for a set of each, approximately?” She asked *I sure hope it’s not to expensive*

“Let's say 15 pounds per case?” He answered

“How many bullets in a case?” 

“Ten”

“That will be 60 pounds, yes?”

“Yes”

“You still have the extra 78 pounds from me, so I'll take the 4 cases, the rest can be considered a tip, or maybe... Gift of Friendship?” She asked somewhat teasingly *Maybe I can immediately get another ‘friend’ here*

“Thank you for the tip,” Cyril smiles, and puts out a hand. “If I ever come across new bullets or weapons, I’ll give you a notice.”

*Tough nut to crack, not enough for friendship, but enough for business, huh?* “That would be much appreciated. You can find me in Natrus. I assume you're in Oscillus? Or are you unregistered?” Eli looks with a very inquisitive look, but she turned that look off immediately

“Oscillus”

“I see, well, it's nice meeting you.”

“Likewise”
