That's when it struck me - yeah, there's hardly anything to explore the city as a 'tourist'. 

And I started roaming around the old lanes of Indore - trying to learn about its stories, legends, history and heritage. 

6 Years later, we are doing a Heritage Walk in Indore - to create awareness amongst Indoris, the new-settlers and tourists about the People, Places, Culture and Heritage - that shaped the city of Indore.

1nm5861,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1nm5861/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster Worth It,"Crafting quality coffee each day is like a ritual for me, so I decided to try out the Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 KBGV Select coffee maker. As a self-claimed coffee aficionado, I was intrigued by the promise of consistent brewing, simple operations, and an appealing design. While it's not my first experience with high-end coffee machines, this particular product brought unique elements to the table.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing to catch my eye was its sophisticated design, with the bold juniper color finish adding a dash of elegance to my kitchen counter. Beyond looks, the build feels solid, thanks to the combination of metal housing and durable glass components. Its dimensions are manageable at 6.5 inches deep, 12.75 inches wide, and 14 inches high, making it fit neatly even in smaller kitchen spaces. The glass carafe and the hotplate are well-designed, ensuring both functionality and style. While it’s not as compact as some coffee makers on the market, the sturdiness and quality definitely make up for the slight bulk.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Operating this coffee machine couldn’t be simpler – it’s practically built to be intuitive. It takes a single flick of the switch to set everything in motion. The standout feature here is the Brew-Volume Selector, which lets you alternate between brewing a half or full carafe effortlessly. With two settings tailored to different quantities, I felt like I had precise control over my brewing needs for both lazy mornings alone and when hosting coffee lovers. The auto shut-off feature after 100 minutes adds a layer of safety, saving me several leaps across the house to ensure I hadn’t left it running.

Check [Technivorm Moccamaster 53923] price on Amazon.

**Performance That Delivers**  
The Technivorm Moccamaster does not disappoint when it comes to coffee quality. I was amazed at how consistent it was every time I used it. The pump-free design heats the water to an ideal extraction temperature, creating a brew that’s robust yet smooth, making every sip pure joy. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is how quickly it brews, managing a full 40-ounce pot in just 4 to 6 minutes. Despite its rapid pace, the machine operates with a quiet demeanor, easing the chaotic vibe of busy mornings.

**Strengths**  
- Remarkably quiet when brewing, which is a big plus for early risers like me.  
- Temperature control hits the sweet spot for perfect coffee extraction.  
- Its simple one-switch operation means anyone can use it effortlessly.  
- Durable materials and a five-year warranty signpost its longevity.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- While efficient, the paper filter requirement feels slightly cumbersome compared to reusable mesh options.  
- It carries a higher price tag, which may deter casual drinkers.  
- Lacks the option to control coffee strength beyond choosing full or half carafes.  

**Product Rivals**  
The coffee maker market is teeming with alternatives, and this product stands tall thanks to its simplicity and precision. Take the Breville Precision Brewer, for example. While it offers more programmable features like strength control and temperature choices, it doesn’t match the Technivorm’s ease of use or its timeless durability. Comparatively, the Oxo Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker provides better performance for smaller households but falls short on brewing speed for larger quantities. What sets the Technivorm apart is its focus on delivering a ""golden cup"" quality every time. For those prioritizing craftsmanship over bells and whistles, this coffee maker feels like a winner.

**Price Performance**  
While it leans toward the pricier side, the Technivorm Moccamaster offers value that matches its cost. Considering its well-engineered design, the consistent quality in each brew, and top-tier durability, this is more of an investment rather than just another coffee gadget. If you're someone who appreciates simplicity paired with authentic quality, the value speaks for itself. I wouldn’t label it budget-friendly, but you’re likely to find the long-term return worth every penny.

1nm585q,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1nm585q/trip_report_kuala_lumpur_malaysia_16th_to_26th/,"[Trip Report] Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 16th to 26th August","I stayed in *Brickfields* (aka Little India), just south of the famous skyscrapers, for 10 days while working remotely. Sharing my thoughts here for anyone considering KL as a short digital nomad stop or solo trip.

# Location & First Impressions

Brickfields is a convenient base. It’s only a 5-minute walk to Central Mall and KL Sentral station, which connects you directly to the airport in 30 minutes for about £10. The area is busy and diverse, though honestly not as clean as Chiang Mai (where I was before this).

One of the coolest everyday things: hearing Hindu temple bells, the Muslim adhan, and Taoist chants all within earshot. KL is multi-faith in a way you can *literally* hear.

# Food Scene

If you like Indian food, you’ll be spoiled. Brickfields has phenomenal South Indian restaurants and some of the best Hyderabadi biryani I’ve ever had.

In Central Mall, there’s a hawker-style food court where meals run around £3. The Japanese curry rice and Malaysian grill stalls stood out, but some of the noodle soups tasted rubbery or stale.

Food delivery is cheap (under £2, even less if you take the “delayed” option) and the variety beats Thailand hands down: Malaysian, Chinese (dim sum, Sichuan, HK-style), South/North Indian, Thai chicken rice, Middle Eastern, Japanese, Korean, plus all the usual fast food chains.

Coffee and tea culture is fun to explore. Some of the Malaysian kopi has unusual flavors, but it’s worth trying them all.

# Accommodation (Riviera Apartments)

I stayed in a new high-rise block Riveria city still under construction. The pros: modern rooms, reasonable prices for the quality, insane views of KL’s skyline, and even Thean Hou Temple in sight. There’s also an included coworking lounge on the top floor that was a huge bonus.

The cons: cold pool and jacuzzi (no heating), a small gym with only 4 machines although access was included, and elevators that were always crowded since the building isn’t finished yet.

https://reddit.com/link/1nm585q/video/v7r8jaif1dqf1/player

# Coworking (Colabs, Central Mall)

I worked from Colabs between Aug 17–23. A weekly pass gives you 7 working days, but note: they close on weekends and at 5 pm sharp.

Seating in the front area is uncomfortable for long hours, but staff kindly let me use the event hall most days, which had much better desks and chairs. If they hadn’t, I’d knock off at least 1.5 stars.

Being in a mall is convenient though: loads of food, Old Town Café upstairs, and that hawker area just downstairs. Only downside is mall air-con—it can be freezing if you’re in shorts and a T-shirt.

# Getting Around

KL has an extensive metro system and taxis are affordable (\~£10 to the Bird Park). I tried the bus once but found the system confusing—you need a Touch ’n Go card, and buying one was a hassle.

The city is roughly half cash, half card. It’s unpredictable which places take which, so keep both handy.

# Things I did

* **KL Bird Park** – a massive open-air aviary with free-roaming birds. Surprisingly good.
* **Thean Hou Temple** – visible from my apartment; beautiful and popular for weddings.
* **Museum / Arts District** – near the Bird Park you’ll also find the National Museum and Islamic Arts Museum. I didn’t make it, but they’re walkable.

# Observations

* KL is more affordable than it looks street food and Nasi Kandar canteens are cheap and filling.
* English is widely spoken, so communication is never a problem.
* You’ll notice more visible homelessness. Interestingly, KL is also one of the most blind-accessible cities I’ve seen, with lots of visually impaired people navigating independently.
* Morning walks in Brickfields mean bumping into local school kids one of those daily-life snapshots that make a place feel real. It calms you down for some reason.

I used to wake up every morning with the same problem: stubborn belly fat that refused to budge. I tried cutting carbs, running miles on end, even those late-night “detox teas” that promised miracles but delivered nothing. My metabolism felt broken, my energy tanked halfway through the day, and the mirror was a constant reminder of failure.

That’s when I stumbled onto something different—**a natural liver support supplement designed to torch fat, reset metabolism, and restore energy without stimulants.**

At first, I was skeptical. Everything I’d tried before felt like hype. But this formula had something unique: ingredients tied directly to **liver detox, fat burning, improved digestion, and healthy weight loss.** It wasn’t about blasting my body with caffeine or gimmicks. It was about addressing the root cause—how the liver handles toxins and fat storage.

The first week, I noticed subtle changes. Less bloating. A lighter feeling after meals. By the second week, my energy curve stopped crashing mid-afternoon. I wasn’t dragging myself through work anymore; I was actually clear, focused, and alert. And by the end of the first month, the scale finally moved. **The fat around my midsection began shrinking in a way I hadn’t seen in years.**

Here’s the thing: this wasn’t just physical. My confidence shifted. Clothes fit differently. My posture changed. I walked into rooms sharper, more certain. When your body finally feels aligned, it spills into every area of life. I closed bigger deals at work. My evenings weren’t wasted on exhaustion; I had the energy to hit the gym and still take my family out.

The turning point came when I realized it wasn’t about chasing fads anymore. **Supporting liver health, optimizing metabolism, and burning stubborn fat naturally** became my foundation. That’s the formula that worked when everything else failed.

Looking back, I can see how close I was to giving up, convinced nothing would work for me. But this supplement shifted the trajectory of my health, my career, and my personal life. **If you’re serious about weight loss, energy, and total body transformation, it starts by fixing what’s broken inside.**

This isn’t just another diet pill story. It’s proof that when you target the right mechanism—**liver function, metabolism, and fat oxidation**—you unlock results that actually last.

When I started with HepatoBurn, I didn’t expect much. Years of empty promises had made me jaded. But within the first few days, I felt something shift. My digestion wasn’t fighting me anymore. I wasn’t bloated after simple meals. It was like my body was processing food the way it was supposed to.

The second week, I noticed a huge difference in my **energy levels**. Before, I would crash every afternoon, reaching for coffee or sugar just to make it through work. That cycle of spikes and crashes was killing my productivity. With HepatoBurn, the crash disappeared. I had steady energy all day, the kind of natural fuel that made me sharper at work and more present at home.

By week three, the scale started moving—but more importantly, the **stubborn belly fat** that clung to my midsection finally began to melt away. This wasn’t just “water weight” or an overnight trick. My waistline was visibly smaller, my clothes fit differently, and for the first time in years, I looked in the mirror and felt proud instead of frustrated.

The deep change, though, was how my body *felt*. My metabolism didn’t feel sluggish anymore. My workouts actually counted. I’d sweat, recover faster, and see results stack up. It was clear: **supporting my liver health was unlocking my body’s fat-burning potential.**

Here’s the breakdown of how it worked for me:

* **Liver support first.** The formula helped clear out the sluggish, heavy feeling that had held me back. That meant toxins weren’t weighing me down, and my body could function at full capacity.
* **Improved digestion.** No more bloating after every meal. Nutrients were being absorbed, and that made a noticeable difference in energy.
* **Metabolism reset.** Instead of my body storing fat, I was finally burning it. That’s why the fat loss felt real and lasting, not temporary.
* **Natural energy.** No jitters, no caffeine spikes—just consistent fuel to get through long days without crashing.

The real win? Confidence. With every pound lost, every inch gone from my waist, I felt unstoppable. That confidence carried into business meetings, workouts, and even my relationships. It wasn’t just weight loss—it was **a complete reset of how I approached health, success, and momentum in life.**

HepatoBurn didn’t just burn fat. It gave me control back. And once you taste that kind of freedom—where your body, energy, and results are aligned—you don’t go back.

**What is HepatoBurn?**  
HepatoBurn is a natural dietary supplement designed to support liver health, boost metabolism, and help the body burn stubborn fat. It uses a blend of ingredients like milk thistle, berberine, and herbal extracts to promote detoxification, digestion, and healthy weight loss

**How does HepatoBurn work?**  
HepatoBurn works by targeting the liver, which is responsible for processing toxins and managing fat storage. By supporting liver function, the body can burn fat more efficiently, reduce bloating, and improve energy levels without relying on stimulants.

**How long does it take to see results with HepatoBurn?**  
Results vary, but many users notice changes within 2–3 weeks. The first signs are usually reduced bloating and better energy. Visible fat loss around the midsection often appears by the third or fourth week, especially when paired with a healthy diet and exercise.

**Are there any side effects of HepatoBurn?**  
Because HepatoBurn is made with natural ingredients, most people tolerate it well. Some users may experience mild digestive adjustments in the first few days, but these usually fade quickly. If you have medical conditions or take medications, it’s always smart to check with your doctor first.

**Can HepatoBurn really help with stubborn belly fat?**  
Yes. One of the biggest benefits reported is the reduction of stubborn abdominal fat. By optimizing liver health and metabolism, HepatoBurn helps the body release stored fat in problem areas like the belly and waistline.

**Is HepatoBurn safe to use long-term?**  
The ingredients are natural and designed for ongoing support of liver health and metabolism. Many people use HepatoBurn as part of a long-term wellness plan, but again, consulting with a healthcare provider is recommended.

**Where can I buy HepatoBurn?**  
HepatoBurn is sold through its official website to ensure quality and guarantee. Purchasing directly often comes with money-back guarantees and package discounts.",1,1758391493.0,ReviewDaily,0,1.0,False

I started my shift with my favorite cup of coffee, in a good mood , completely unaware of the disasters waiting ahead.

The endorsement I received from the previous shift seemed straightforward: a patient with upper GI bleeding, currently stable, just needed CBC monitoring. The gastroenterology team was scheduled to scope her the next morning. The repeat CBC came back reassuring, with hemoglobin stable at 10.

Me and the resident were sitting together, laughing as we shared stories of funny on-call moments. Then, out of nowhere, the phone rang. The nurse’s voice was urgent, almost panicked: “Come immediately!”

We sprinted to the room. The scene was horrific ,Blood everywhere. The patient was vomiting massive amounts of blood, hematochezia soaking the bed. She was gasping for air. We immediately called a rapid response. Intubation was done on the spot, and she was rushed to the ICU while still actively bleeding. Her CBC came back: hemoglobin had crashed from 10 to 5. The on-call gastroenterologist was contacted urgently, but his response was: “Stabilize the patient. She’s unfit for scope.”

We returned to our room in silence, still shaken by what we had just witnessed. Neither of us had ever seen anything like it. For two hours, we worked quietly, carrying the weight of the moment until the phone rang again. This time, the nurse was shouting: “Come assess the patient, there’s massive hemoptysis!”

Once again, we ran. The floor was streaked with blood. The patient was coughing up large amounts, restless, tachypneic, oxygen saturation dropping to 46% on room air. Another rapid response was activated. We gave tranexamic acid, but there was no improvement. High-flow nasal cannula brought the saturation up, but the hemoptysis continued. CT showed no active bleeding, and the patient was admitted to ICU for observation.

I thought the nightmare was finally over. Little did I know, it wasn’t.

Soon after, the lab called with a panic result for a patient who was admitted as a case of PE : hemoglobin had dropped , this time from 10 to 4. I rushed to examine the patient. There was no active bleeding per rectum, no hematemesis, no hemoptysis. The patient denied further bleeding but complained of right pelvic pain. When I examined the area, I found a huge ecchymosis with a palpable mass. An urgent CTA was arranged, revealing a large right medial thigh intramuscular hematoma fortunately with no evidence of active bleeding.

And just like that, the nightmare finally came to an end.",3,1758391394.0,Residency,1,0.8,False

Before I left to make my way to the meeting venue I texted and explained that my head wasn't in a good place, which she ignored, thats fine.
So when I arrive she is sat there with two of her friends eating breakfast. I do know these people but we arent 'friends' more acquaintances.
To me, arranging a catch up means a two person conversation, not inviting someone to feel like they are crashing a meal.
I was not feeling up to polite conversation so I politely said, oh you have company, ill catch you later. My friend made a fuss and said oh no, I should have arranged it to be just us.
It was so awkward, I made excuses and left. Now im stressing out because im guessing the two others will be thinking im really rude.
I got back home and sat in freeze mode for hours. I appreciate that sounds crazy but I was really going through it at the time.

So heres the thing, the friend texted and apologised and said she'd be in touch later, hours later she texts saying, how are you?

I responded by being 100% truthful and said I was upset and needed to calm down and id speak later.
She immediately sent a voice note that was so patronising, passive aggressive and basically telling me that I was wrong for feeling upset.

Id been crying my eyes out and responded by raising my voice (which of course is unacceptable)

Its been a week and ive texted to see if she wants to meet up so that I can explain my reaction, shes left me on read, its been 

She spends all day every day sitting outside of coffee shops chatting so whenever I go into town I will feel awkward passing by as i just know she will have been talking badly about me.

She has some of my physical media and a couple of bits that I want back but shes ignoring me, no idea what to do about that.

Ive managed to leave the house only once since this bullshit happened, im now thinking that I just shouldn't explain my mental health issues to anyone in the future.

Anyway, I need my stuff back so if anyone has suggestions please let me know.

1nm4t15,https://www.reddit.com/r/LahoreSocial/comments/1nm4t15/today_after_years_i_experienced_something_i_can/,"Today, after years, I experienced something I can hardly put into words.","Tonight felt like stepping into a memory I didn’t know I had been yearning for. I was in the kitchen, whisking together a cup of Dalgona, when I let Spotify surprise me. The first song it offered was Deathbed, and as the melody filled the air, I found myself softly singing along, just like I used to when I was so utterly obsessed with it.

Almost instinctively, I switched to another old favorite, Come Thru by Jeremy Zucker.  Coffee whipping in hand, I gently moved with the rhythm; slow steps, soft shakes, letting the music carry me. For a moment, I wasn’t simply dancing; I was drifting.

And then it struck me. I was back in the winters of 2019, the season I’ve so often longed for. The feeling washed over me like a forgotten dream, blissful, golden, untouchable. Alhamdulillah, it was as if a hidden part of my soul stirred awake, a part I thought I had lost.

It wasn’t just nostalgia. It was magic. A moment that felt endless, as though time folded in on itself and handed me a fragment of who I used to be, reminding me that she is still here, alive within me.

Today my cheap secondary bike (that I use for errands) was taken. Both incidents at the same spot. In front of the Balzacs Coffee shop at The Toronto Reference Library, Asquith and Yonge to be specific. 


I'll admit the lock that I used today was a cheap one and I feel stupid for doing do especially after what happened last week. 


Last summer, I had another hybrid bike stolen (used a U-lock) from Jarvis and Wellesley. I filed a police report pointing them to the business that had footage of my bike being stolen but I never heard back from TPS. I don't expect anything this time either.


Posting this so you learn from my mistake. Secure your bikes! Use a heavy duty U lock, use more than one lock. Anything that is quick release or easy to cut will be taken.

1nm4q0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nm4q0e/struggling_with_new_relationship_am_i_just/,Struggling with new relationship - am I just self-sabataging or is something off?,"I'm in my early twenties and he's in his early thirties. We've been together officially for one month, but we've known each other for a few years - he used to work at my university (not a professor) and we matched on a dating app and remained friends until we eventually got together this summer. Right now we are long distance because I moved states after graduating. We visit each other about once a month. He is super nice and I have never questioned his loyalty. As someone who is a bit older than me, he can be really knowledgeable about things, which is super, super helpful. I know he'd do whatever I asked him to do. He's obsessed with me and treats me well.

My biggest concern is with how needy he can be. He cries and self-punishes when we have any sort of conflict and is constantly seeking validation from me. I feel bad because, as his girlfriend, I want to give that to him, but it's really a lot. It honestly gives me the ick. He once sat on the floor in the dark for three hours while I was asleep because he thought I was mad at him after a tense conversation that I thought we had resolved. He stayed there until I woke up, and then he cried and told me all the different ways he was overthinking, a text conversation he was having WITH HIMSELF to self-soothe, and the messages he was sending to ChatGPT. This happens often. The original conversation was about something that had hurt my feelings, and it ended with me comforting him and reassuring him constantly that I did still like him. He gets really hurt if I don't make an equal number of kissy noises back to him, or if I don't say ""I love you"" right after we say goodnight, even if I said it before. Or if I mute myself when I pee, do my makeup to go work at a coffee shop, talk or look in the direction of other men, etc. He got mad at ME because my ex tried to follow me on social media. Also, once when we were together in-person I went to the bathroom and when I returned to my laptop, my trashcan and several apps were open on my desktop. I feel like he had tried to go through my laptop quickly when I was in the bathroom because I don't remember leaving those things open like that.

Thing is that he frames all of his jealous remarks as a joke so I can't truly be upset because then he'll claim he was ""clearly joking,""

Also, a small thing he does that bothers me is that he seeks validation in really off-putting, cringey ways. Like, he'll make a weird face on FaceTime, I'll ignore it, and he'll say something to the tune of, ""I'm so glad you didn't see that,"" and then he'll make the face again and hold it until I notice him, and then he'll pretend to be embarrassed. It's just so weird. Or he tries to sexily eat food only to get it all over his face and body. He also constantly says stuff like ""Who could ever love someone as ugly as me?"" The thing is that he also says this in a joking tone, so I can't really say that it makes me feel off because then he'll just insist he was joking, except for the fact that he probably does it 20+ times a day.

He also already told his family and friends about me and is trying to get me to go meet them. He talks about marriage and kids. Also, I feel like the financial strain has somehow been being placed on me even though he's salaried and has an established career, but I only just graduated college. I also have way more savings than him somehow which throws me off. He talks about moving in with me when I go to grad school.

I'm super independent and have basically raised myself my whole life. I lost a parent at a young age and have been NC with the rest of my family on and off for years, now permanently for about a year. I have been in abusive relationships and have a very jaded and politicized view of them that might be affecting how I feel about this. I'm not sure if my instincts are warning me or if I'm hyperfixating on small issues and ruining an otherwise perfect relationship.

1nm4q03,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1nm4q03/day_1/,Day 1,"Hi y’all. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who posts on here and gives advice. I have been wanting to try IF for a while now. I’m between jobs at the moment and haven’t worked in about a month. My new job is starting in a couple of weeks. It has been really difficult for me this past month with controlling my eating habits. I feel like the more time I spend at home, the more I eat.

It seems to be easier to have routine when you’re working 5 days a week and have structure. I (24F) am currently at roughly 280 lbs (last time I checked a couple of weeks ago) at 5’4. Very obese. I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and have been seriously wanting to lose weight for well over a year now. My PCP recommends starting with a goal of 5-10% of my body weight and going from there to take some pressure off my joints. When I was a freshman in college I was at 200 lbs- still very overweight for my height but not nearly as much as now. I’ve just slowly put it on over the last 5-6 years and now when I look at the idea of being a healthy weight, it seems so daunting.

I really like the idea of IF because it’s so structured. I think what will be hardest for me is not drinking my calories. Never been a fan of soda but boy do I love iced coffee. And cooking at home. Not a fan of cooking but I’m trying to teach myself how to meal prep. I’m hoping if I can just lose some weight to get started, I will feel better overall and have more energy to get out and be more active.

Anyway, today is day 1. I’m just going to try to take it one day at a time. My goal is to lose a pound a week. Not very much, but it is WAY better than gaining a lb or more a week. I’m trying out the 16:8 fast. I don’t usually eat breakfast (besides that iced coffee dang it) anyway and am kind of used to going about 12 hours without eating so 16 hours feels like a reasonable goal. 

Hoping I can stay motivated and looking forward to learning more and more about IF and healthy choices as time goes by. Really feeling like this could be the time I finally actually start to get my shit together.",3,1758390567.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

8 mos ago my husband  and I were driving  my MIL car we hit a deer, car is totalled. Everyone was fine and my mother in law was just happy  that was the case. Her insurance actually  gave her double what the car was worth. That aside this lady was my friend. She was older but we would come over she liked playing with the kids . She was always extremely  opinionated and nosey so I was careful  what I said. I don't have much for friends in the area so it was still nice just to have some to have coffee with.  I just everyone has their faults. I am far from perfect.  Incoming , my temper haha . Anyway  we were having dinner at a cafe. And we were discussing pick up of the stuff in her car. She had said there was so much stuff it might take a few trips.  It was 2 hour drive away so I said im only  going once we can fit.it all in or else well have to when I am going anyway or maybe you could  contribute  a little for gas.. it was probably  something  we shouldn't have been talking about in front of her as I wasnt serious i was teasing!  There wasnt that much stuff and it only half filled a small car. But this  lady said loudly  OMG are you serious?? You crash up *names* car  and expect her to pay gas to pick up the stuff. I wasnt serious  and everyone knew that. And it wasnt her conversation.  I wasnt driving so I didn't "" crash up the car"" my mil often has us drive because  at her age she often doesn't feel comfortable.  Also a bug semi  was coming  the opposite  way when it passed  the sun directly shone in my husbands eyes and then the colossion happened . But anyway I told her, No! Stop it. Stop always criticizing everyone else I wasnt saying that I was kidding and your being really rude.  I didn't tell I said with force. We all finished our meal it didn't seem awkward  everyone  continued  to be nice to each other. I realize  I shouldn't  have snapped. I think it was a cumulation of all the criticism from hanging out with her for so long.  I should  have been happy  for the end of thos friendship but I mourn any friendship.  I know its better for me not to be spending time with her as when I left I would  often leave feeling  tired and unsure of myself.  I know you shouldn't  feel that way after coffee.  My Mil days we are both much better off without her . The weird  thing is a couple  months  after the incident  she asked to be my friend  on Facebook.  I thought  ahe had moved on. But now I realize,  after I ran into her today and she struggled  to say hi and tried to avoid  me. That she just wanted to spy  and keep tabs on me.. she likes to know what everyone us up to at all times.  So I guess I am wondering  should I block her and make it official or should  I reach out and try and discuss what happened? My mil, best friend ans husband  say shes toxic and and I should  stay away from her. I know this but I still mourn the loss of even a toxic friendship ",1,1758390527.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1nm4l8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nm4l8e/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_delonghi_la/,Explore the best espresso machine DeLonghi La Specialista Arte Evo review,"Using the De'Longhi EC9255M Espresso Machine for a few weeks now, I can safely say it has been an excellent addition to my kitchen. As someone who loves brewing coffee at home and experimenting with different styles, this machine piqued my interest with its array of advanced features. It has a unique blend of style, performance, and customization that made my morning coffee ritual even more enjoyable. Although it's not perfect, it comes impressively close to giving coffee shop-quality results in the comfort of your home.

**Refined Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the sleek stainless-steel design. It doesn’t just look premium; it feels sturdy too. Measuring at 14.37"" x 11.22"" x 15.87"", it’s relatively compact for an espresso machine with so many features, which was particularly helpful for fitting it into my small kitchen. The included barista kit—a tamper, tamping mat, milk frothing jug, and dosing funnel—was a bonus, setting me up for perfectly crafted coffees without having to buy extra accessories. However, the stainless steel exterior, while attractive, is prone to fingerprints, so be prepared to wipe it down regularly if you want to keep it looking polished.

**Features and Performance**  
What really sets this espresso machine apart is the technology it packs. The built-in conical burr grinder was a revelation. With its eight different grind settings, I was able to experiment with various coffee beans to achieve my preferred extraction level. What amazed me most was how consistently it ground the beans, whether I needed a single espresso or a double. The grinder's precision really makes a difference in the overall flavor, especially if you’re picky like me about how your coffee tastes.  

[Check De'Longhi EC9255M price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0cczqcnlj/)  

The Cold Extraction Technology was another standout feature. Making cold brew in under five minutes sounded too good to be true, but let me tell you, it actually works. As someone who craves cold coffee even in winter, this turned out to be more practical than I expected. The brewed coffee was smooth and well-balanced, with none of the bitterness I sometimes get using traditional methods.  

**Strengths**  
- Cold Extraction Technology delivers cold brew in less than five minutes.  
- Eight grind settings enable precise customization for various coffee types.  
- Active Temperature Control ensures optimal extraction for different beans.  

**Compact and User-Friendly Operation**  
For a semi-automatic machine, the controls are straightforward. There are preset recipes—Espresso, Americano, Cold Brew, and Hot Water—that streamline the process when I’m in a rush. That said, the manual options like temperature control and grind settings allow for deeper experimentation. These options are accessible enough for beginners while offering enough flexibility to keep seasoned coffee enthusiasts engaged. I was particularly impressed with the Active Temperature Control, which prevented fluctuations I used to experience with my previous machine.  

The steam wand deserves special mention. It heats quickly and produces just the right amount of pressure for smooth, consistent microfoam—ideal for latte art. Although I’m no professional barista, I managed to pull off a couple of decent hearts after a few tries! My colleagues, who came over to taste-test, compared my cappuccinos to those from their favorite cafes, which, frankly, was both surprising and delightful.

**Cons**  
- The price might be slightly steep for beginners or casual coffee drinkers.  
- The grinder, while excellent, can be a little noisy during operation.  
- Regular cleaning is essential as residue builds up quickly in the steam wand.  

**Challengers**  
As much as I’m enjoying this machine, it’s only fair to note how it matches up to competitors. Machines like the Breville Barista Express and Gaggia Classic Pro, for instance, come close in quality. The Breville also has an integrated grinder but lacks the Cold Extraction Technology, making it less versatile for iced coffee lovers. Gaggia’s steam wand might rival De'Longhi’s for precision, but it doesn’t include features like temperature presets or the convenience of presets. If you mainly focus on traditional espressos and lattes rather than experimenting with cold brews or intricate recipes, those alternatives could still serve your needs.  

**Affordable Quality**  
While this isn’t the cheapest espresso machine on the market, it offers a lot for its price tag. Considering the versatility of features—including the grinder, steam wand, and cold brew capabilities—the balance between quality and cost seems fair. The home barista kit saves you from spending extra on tools, which adds to the overall value proposition. It's also worth mentioning that some components, like portions of the barista kit, are dishwasher safe, cutting down on time spent cleaning up.

I am on a bus hike returning. I spoke with an English lady named Sansa at length and we enjoyed talking. At one point of the hike, a washroom came and she said I will be right back. By the time she returned I was talking with another person. Then a group photo was taken, and I started talking with 2 other girls.  Sansa started talking with another woman. And then in another 10 min we reached the starting point of the hike which meant we had to get on the bus to return to the actual starting point where we all met. 

Just before getting on the bus, I stood beside her and asked how’s it going and she said good, and then we had to continue listening to the announcement that the leader was making. Once the leader was done and we were supposed to get on the bus , I said to her , “we left our conversation at union” and she said oh, took a time to recall and said something. Then I asked would you like to take this conversation forward and asked her number , and she punched it in my phone. I sent her a text before getting on the bus. 

Next is we got on the bus. I wanted to sit beside her and continue talking. But I thought it would be rude since she might want to be alone on her way back and enjoy the ride peacefully. Another reason is I could have bored her on the ride back and she might have said no to meeting me later. 

I am on the bus right like just everyone.  

What should I had done? Should I had asked her if I can sit beside her and sat beside her? 

I thought I would come off as desperate if I asked to sit beside her and talk with her all the way back.

She’s on the bus too and has not responded to my message yet. Obviously she has checked her phone many a times by now, because , well , everybody does on bus rides. 

I am not sitting beside her right now. 

My next window of opportunity is when we get down the bus. 

Should I just ask her out as soon as we get down. Should I say - “I enjoyed talking with you. I find you attractive. Can we meet for a coffee sometime so that I get to know you more?”",1,1758390121.0,BrosDatingAdvice,1,1.0,False

1nm4il5,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1nm4il5/need_some_infj_insight_was_there_a_spark_or_was_i/,"Need some INFJ insight- was there a spark, or was i imaging it?","Hey INFJs, I’m hoping to get your take on my situation.

I recently met a woman (INFJ and in her late 20s, confirmed by her) at a group dinner/gathering. I’m a guy in my early 30s, and I’d say I’m an ENFP. During the dinner, we clicked hard. Like… same worldview, same curiosity, same interests and hobbies, attachment styles, Myers-Briggs, even how we see relationships.

During the dinner, She maintained great eye contact, body language that shows attraction, teased me playfully a few times, paid extra attention to me during the dinner, mentioned she was single more than once, and really opened up when we talked about self-growth. There was definitely amazing energy and chemistry between us that you can not fake, and I felt like we saw each other in a way that doesn’t happen often.

The next day, I messaged her to say that I felt a connection with her and I’d love to grab coffee sometime soon. She responded very positively — said that she felt the same way with me, and agreed to hanging out very enthusiastically. But when I followed up to actually pick a day, she went quiet.

The next day I opened my Messenger and was responding to my other friend, and I noticed she was **typing a response** and I thought I was gonna get a message… then nothing. Sounds like she was thinking about what to say back, but she left me on read and never replied to me with a date to confirm the plan. Now it’s been 2 days since my last message and I’m trying not to overthink it.

So I wanted to ask:

* From an INFJ perspective… could she just be processing before she respond?
* Is it possible she felt something real and backed off because it was too real too fast?
* What makes you hesitate to reply when you did feel a connection?

I’m not mad or pressuring her at all. Just curious how you all process this kind of thing emotionally. Especially when someone sees through you — is that scary? Or overwhelming? ",1,1758390076.0,infj,0,1.0,False

I average $300 in sales each day I’m there.

There are a few things you can do to maximize your profits: buy and equip as much festive decor as you can (from the seller in the market and Anne) to increase the number of customers and buy the roasted nuts and coffee from Moira to get two extra recommendation opportunities. It’s also good to take advantage of all the warm decor you have, because it will be snowing half the time. You’ll get TONS of customers, so using your coffee machine, as always, is a great way to make more money.

I hope this helps somebody! I’ve seen a few posts about money-making difficulties and wanted to throw this advice into the subreddit.",8,1758390046.0,TinyBookshop,1,1.0,False

Today he saw that he brought his brother even though we don’t have many customers on Saturday and his brother asked my dad to come talk to him about some job that he was looking for, anyway, my dad asked him after that if he’d like a ride home and he replied with “no im just gonna stay here” (he was just drinking coffee with his brother before opening) and my dad replied with okay thinking he’s just gonna drink his coffee and leave, he stayed and is working with his brother in the kitchen without my dad’s approval and my dad doesn’t want him here but there’s no way he’s gonna just tell him to go home, he has such bad communication problems. I’ve talked to him and my mom multiple times about this and told them that you can’t just “hint” the worker to go home by asking him if he would like a ride home and that businesses don’t operate this way and they just DONT seem to understand, and my mom is a professional denier, even if I talk to her she denies reality in any way possible its literally impossible for her to understand anything, and my dad can’t be spoken to without him getting angry and all over the place.

Her family was poor and didn't have many contacts. 
One day on Saturday Madalena was in the bath while her mother was sleeping, her stepfather was working, at least that's what she thought until the door opened. 
When he turned back he came face to face with his stepfather, his heart was beating fast, his eyes wide as the water fell. Her bloodied and naked stepfather, staring at the girl as if she were a piece of meat, there was no sanity in his eyes. 
Madalena managed to push him not very far, but giving her space to pass, she ran almost slipping to her mother's room, her stepfather was right behind her, walking slowly and then he said: ""open the door"". Innocent Madalena opened the door to ask for her mother's help, but when the door was opened the only thing she found was her mother with her intestines hanging out, her eyes pierced, her mouth open full of blood, she had cuts on her legs and arms, the bed was full of blood and organs were flying out. 
Madalena fell to the floor and started crying: ""WHAT DID YOU?! "" It seemed like there was an emptiness in her, she looked to the side and saw her stepfather even closer, he picked up the girl and she started screaming for help, he ripped out Madalena's tongue and then covered her mouth with his member, he started to move and moan. 
In pain, the girl began to try to get out, because every time he moved, what was left of her tongue was disfigured and released blood everywhere, even though she swallowed most of the blood. Her stepfather pulled out of her mouth and slapped her hard in the face, he took a cloth and tied it to the girl, covering her mouth, which got blood on the cloth and made her swallow the rest. 
He placed Madalena on all fours and began to penetrate her without her will, Madalena felt enormous pain in her vagina and it seemed like she was being torn from the inside, the pain was so great that she started vomiting what she ate the day before, even because she hadn't eaten anything until now, and as the cloth covered her mouth she ended up swallowing the vomit. 
The rape lasted about 5 hours, when the stepfather took off the cloth from the girl and went to take a shower, she started crying and crawled towards her mother's body, but when she was halfway there her stepfather saw her, he had an ax and was walking slowly towards the girl who was now trying to crawl towards the door, but when she looked at the door she felt the first ax and screamed, the second in her foot, the third in her back, the fourth and fifth in her hip and the last in her neck, the pain was so enormous that Madalena died. 
His stepfather took his body and started crying, put it in a bag, cleaned himself and threw it in the trash. Neighbors who heard the screams called the police and he was arrested and sentenced to 39 years in prison. 
Kurkova Street was taken over by journalists wanting to interview the neighbors. 

3 years later Joshua was returning home from work in his car, on the way he met a woman in a white dress, the street was empty and it was already 2 in the morning. He then thought about stopping to help her. 
The woman accepted and said that she lives on Kurkova Street, he asked her what her name was and she replied: ""Magdalene"", he innocently said: ""Wow, what a coincidence, a girl died on Kurkova Street by her stepfather when she was 9 years old, her name was also Madalena"".
Joshua started driving in silence, when he arrived at Madalena Street he invited him to come in, even though he didn't want to, she insisted until he accepted. 
The house was tidy and despite the street being without light and completely dark, he went in and Madalena served coffee: ""I'm going to take a shower, please don't go into this room"" Joshua said yes and Madalena went to the shower, he was tense and curious to know what was in the room, when he leaned on the doorknob Madalena appeared at his side without clothes on and said: ""what do you think you're doing?""
She pushed Joshua onto the sofa and started kissing him, the mood was good and he laid Madalena down and started penetrating her, at first it was good, but Madalena started screaming and crying like a child. When Joshua looked down he realized it was a child, the same child he saw in the newspaper 3 years ago. 
He got up and stood there terrified and confused: ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"". Madalena got up and he noticed and she had blood coming out of her mouth and vagina, cuts appeared bleeding all over her body: ""Why did you do this to me? I thought we were friends... "" she then approached Joshua and ripped open his belly, taking out intestines and strangling him with them, and then he died.

(2021),"Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your comments and votes under my last post about Nathan Wise- I hope that he will be found soon.

  
Today I'd like to highlight another disappearance



BACKGROUND

  
Bryan Vladek Hasel was 22 when he went missing from Orlando, Florida, USA.

  
His birth name was ""Vladek Pushkin"". In 2004, when he was 5, he was adopted, along with his sister, Irena (11 at the time), from an orphanage in Yegoryevsk in Russia.

  
He graduated from the Marines boot camp in December 2018 and worked a desk job (that he didn't like) untill he was honorably discharged in 2019. He told his family that he found a way to get discharged early by saying he has ""trauma from Russia"". His official disposition was “Failure to adapt"". After that, he moved in with his father, Steve, for a few months.

  
In January of 2020, Vladek moved in with his sister Cari, who lived in Michigan, and got a job as Environmental Services technician at St. John Providence Hospital Southfield- it was said that he enjoyed the job. When the pandemic hit, preschools were closed, and Cari was forced to take a leave of absence from job to look after her daughter, as she was a single mother. Vladek continued to work and financially support the three of them. After a few months, the three moved to Nashua, in New Hampshire; Vladek then lost his job and moved in with Steve and his wife in Florida in summer of 2020.

  
There were some tensions between father and son, as Steve wanted Vladek to start contributing to the household and get a job. It's noted that he started to notice possible signs of depression in Vladek. Steve and his wife ended up divorcing- the two men decided to move out and lived in hotels from September to November of 2020.

  
In 2021, Vladek said that he'd like to live in the woods, but that he'd wait with it untill his dad passes away, as he didn't want to leave Steve alone, and that he didn't want Steve to be blamed for his absence. He also started to become increasingly invested in the idea of Heaven and religion, asking his loved ones ""What is the point if we can just be in Heaven?"". Vladek also begun to live more minimalistically, claiming that material posessions are just ""distractions"" from Heaven. He seemed to lack to lack motivation and purpose, but he loved making people feel important, loved and heard; He would leave large tips in restaurants, handed cash to the needy and happily bought things for anyone who had a need. Once, he gave a homeless man his credit card to use as he pleased.

  
Around September and October, Vladek's baliefs seemed to be getting more intense. He broke his phone on purpose and told his father that it was a ""distraction from Heaven"", and that he also gave his own tablet to his sister Bethany. Steve insisted for Vladek to at least get a flip phone for safety.



He also didn't have a vehicle, and would borrow his father's car when needed.

  
Vladek spent a lot of time at restaurants and buisnesses on University Boulevard and Alafaya Trail. He also spent hours praying and reading the Bible at St. Joseph Catholic Church.

  
DISAPPEARANCE

  
A few days before Vladek disappeared, he bought a pocket knife. He told Steve that he bought it for ""protection"".

  
On the 3rd of November, the car that Vladek and Steve used broke down at Waterford Lakes Plaza near Fresh Kitchen when Vladek was driving it. He walked home on foot. At first, Vladek was anxious to tell Steve that the car broke down, but he took it well, agreed that the car was old and that the engine needed to be changed. The car was towed to the mechanic on the 4th and remained there untill the 15th, when Steve picked it up.

  
Vladek also called an acquaintance who worked in Smokey Bones, an establishment Vladek visited, on the 4th, asking if he could stay at his house ""for a couple nights"". The call was made at 7:13 PM and lasted about 5 minutes. Vladek also talked to his father about ""archangels and demons and how you have to be dark to kill the dark""; Steve said that Vladek wasn't making a lot of sense.

  
Bryan was last seen by Steve on the 5th of November at his family home at Alafaya Trail and MacKay Boulevard. On that day, Steve left on a 10-day trip to meet up with Bethany and her friends and celebrate her birthday. Vladek was also invited, but he declined, as he often did when it came to plans made last-minute. Steve offered to buy more groceries, but Vladek said that what was home was enough. Steve was also expecting a package, and asked Vladek to bring it home when it arrives, and Vladek promised that he will.

  
Shortly after Steve left home, Vladek made his way to Foxtail, a coffee shop on University Blvd, which he frequented. He bought a coffee and was ""pacing"" inside while listening to music on headphones, which was allegedly normal behavior for him according to staff. At some point, Vladek had reportedly pulled out a knife and possibly placed it on one of the tables (he wasn't violent). Another customer saw it and told the staff that Vladek was making him feel uncomfortable and that he's going to leave; The customer left, but returned later during the evening and mentioned the knife to the staff (he didn't say anything about it the first time). By that time, Vladek was gone, so there was no way to address it. There is no video recording of the incident, and the employees said that they didn't witness it either.



Around 2AM on the 6th, Vladek had a phonecall with his biological sister Irena. She said that she didn't get the impression that Vladek was planning to go anywhere. It was normal for the two to talk late at night.



On 7:11AM, Vladek returned to Foxtail. The staff decided to call the police to have Vladek ""permanently tresspassed"" from the cafe due to the knife incident. Vladek left calmly when the police asked him to, and he seemed to be heading towards the WAWA convenience store. At first, the family was told by police that Vladek was trespassed for being ""hyperverbal"", with no references to the alleged knife. That was the last confirmed sighting of Vladek. The police warning was written at 08:26AM.

  
At 12:01PM, Vladek's flip phone recieved a message from an unknown number that said “Vlad, it’s OB from the bak (SIC) of the neighborhood”. Vladek didn't read the text, and there was no activity on the phone after his call with Irena. His phone was found at home, in his room, near a charging cable but not actually charging. The phone was taken by the investigators on the 18th or 19th. It was never shared if ""OB"" was ever tracked down or who it was.

  
On the 8th, around 2PM, the package that Steve was waiting for was delivered and left in front of the house. 

  
On the 12th, Vladek was allegedly seen by a maintenence worker of the apartment complex Vladek lived in and chatted with him for about 5 minutes. 

  
On the 15th, at around 3AM, Vladek allegedly visited someone else in the apartment complex (possibly a weed dealer) and told them that he wants to live ""off the grid"".

  
Steve came home on the 15th, at 4PM, after picking up the car. The package he asked Vladek to pick up was still in front of the house. Vladek wasn't home; All the groceries at home seemed to be untouched, and there were no dirty plates in the sink, like Vladek wasn't there for the whole time Steve was away.

  
On the 17th, Vladek was reported missing by Steve. 

  
During the search of a nearby forest, police located a red flip-flop and asked Steve if it may be Vladek's- Steve said that Vladek owned a similar pair, but he didn't remember him having red ones.

  
On the 12th or 13th of February 2022, around noon, another incident took place in Foxtail; A family has reported that they saw a man having a manic episode near the cafe's dumpster. The man was allegedly talking to himself in an ""animated"" fashion. The family left, and the man was seen going towards the WAWA store. The police wasn't called, ultimately, as the man left, and there are no recordings of the incident preserved. The staff later told Vladek's family that they don't believe it was him, as they were very familiar with Vladek and they would recognize him. 



On the 9th of April, Foxtail shared a still of a video taken on the 6th of November, which showed Vladek arriving at the cafe. To the suprise of his family, Vladek was actually wearing red slides at the time, similar to the one that was found in the forest.  



CONCLUSION

  
The manager of Foxtail told the police that Vladek introduced himself as Bryan, and that's how all the employees knew him as. He came over frequently, paced around the store for a few hours while listening to music on his headphones and sang out-loud, but he would always quiet down with no problems when asked to. Other customers were often unsettled by him, and would tell it to the staff. The manager spoke to ""Bryan"" a few times before he went missing, and got the impression that he waas ""struggling"". When asked, Vladek just told him that he was ""sleep deprived"". 



The Smokey Bones employee that Vladek called shortly before he went missing said that he knew Vladek for about 6 months (with a 2 month break in that), and that they weren't really close. They only met outside work once, when they went to a pawn shop so that Vladek could pawn his guitar. The employee said that he didn't allow Vladek to stay over because he lived with his girlfriend and didn't want to put her at risk. According to him, during the last month before disappearance Vladek went from quoting the Bible and talking about wanting to go on a pilgrimage to wanting to sing. 

  
Bryan Vladek Hasel was 22 when he went missing, and he would be 26 now. He is a white male, 5' 8"" (68 Inch / 173 cm) and 220 lbs (100 kg). He has brown hair and blue eyes. He goes by his middle name, Vladek, or his nickname, Vlad.

  
If you have any info about Vladek's whereabouts, contact the Orange County Sheriff's Office at (407) 254-7200 (case number 21-83864).

1nm4cpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/soothfy/comments/1nm4cpn/the_adhd_reality_check_that_changed_everything/,The ADHD reality check that changed everything for me,"For years, I tortured myself trying to follow neurotypical productivity advice. Wake up at 5 AM (my brain doesn't turn on until 10). Plan your whole week in advance (I can barely predict what I'll want for lunch). Focus for 8 straight hours (LOL).

I kept thinking I was lazy, undisciplined, or just fundamentally broken. Turns out, I was just using the wrong operating manual for my brain.

Here's what actually works when your brain runs on chaos and hyperfocus:

* Work WITH your dopamine, not against it. That boring task you've been avoiding for weeks should be paired with something that gives you a tiny hit of satisfaction. I do my taxes while listening to true crime podcasts. I clean while blasting music that makes me feel like the main character. Your brain needs the good chemicals to function stop trying to white-knuckle through everything.
* ""Task switching"" is a superpower, not a flaw. Neurotypical advice says focus on one thing until it's done. But sometimes my brain wants to do 15 minutes of writing, then organize my desk, then research random facts about penguins. That's not failure.
* Use hyperfocus strategically, don't fight it. When you feel that laser-focus kicking in, drop everything else if you can. Cancel plans. Order takeout. Ride the wave. I've written entire presentations, deep-cleaned my apartment, and learned new skills during spontaneous hyperfocus sessions. It's irregular, but it's powerful. I think this is called flow.
* External accountability > internal motivation. Body doubling changed my life. Having someone else around (even virtually) makes boring tasks 10x easier. I do my admin work on video calls with friends, book cleaning sessions with my roommate, and use ""focus with me"" YouTube videos. My brain behaves better when it thinks someone's watching.
* Make everything visible. Out of sight = out of mind for ADHD brains. I have whiteboards everywhere, sticky notes on my bathroom mirror, and my gym clothes laid out where I'll trip over them. If I can't see it, it doesn't exist in my brain.
* Perfectionism is the enemy of done. My ADHD brain loves to start 47 projects and finish none of them because they're not ""good enough"" yet. Now I practice ""good enough"" completion. Send the email with typos. Submit the decent work instead of waiting for it to be perfect. Done is better than perfect, especially when perfect never comes.
* Build systems around your actual patterns, not ideal ones. I meal prep on random Tuesday afternoons when I suddenly feel like cooking, not every Sunday like the Instagram influencers. I pay bills immediately when I think about them, not on a schedule. I work in coffee shops because my brain needs background noise, not silence.

We (husband/wife/toddler/newborn) considering a move to STL for a job. We are currently in Lincoln Park Chicago, which is extremely walkable and why we love love love living here.

**Before I spend hours researching areas and playgrounds, I want to know if people in these neighborhoods actually have a strong playground culture. If it's not a thing, since everyone has backyards, I will focus on walkability to coffee shops/restuarants/bike shops instead!**

  
The one thing about our current lifestyle I am very firm on trying to preserve is the after daycare gathering at playgrounds. Here in Lincoln Park, we spend 1 hour at the park every day after daycare, hanging with the other parents and socializing before dinner. It's been the way we've met all our parent friends, and I think it will be really helpful in meeting people in STL. 

I've been looking at the close suburbs near the potential office location (thanks in part to the wiki!), and have landed on **Clayton, University City, Webster Grove, Ladue, Kirkwood, Maplewood** due to the walkability. 

  
In a perfect world, we'd live walkable to daycare, multiple parks, a restaurant or two that's kiddo friendly, Forest Park (free zoo!), a coffee shop or two, and bike/running paths, like we have here, but I know that probably doesn't exist, which is okay!! My #1 priority is playgrounds, if that playground community culture exists. So hoping folks can let me know what the young family culture is like in the listed neighborhoods. 

I appreciate any time you spend responding, happy Saturday y'all! We are excited to explore your city :)

1nm4btd,https://i.redd.it/b075mfb4vcqf1.png,Veo3 Fast: The Game-Changer That Actually Gets You,"**Veo3 Fast: The Game-Changer That Actually Gets You**

Picture this: you're scrolling through endless AI video tutorials at 2 AM, thinking ""this looks cool, but will it *actually* work for me?"" Here's the thing—most AI video tools feel like they were built by engineers for other engineers. But Veo3 Fast? It's different. It gets the frustration of wanting to create something amazing without breaking your bank account or your sanity.

# Why Your Creative Brain Will Love This

Let's be honest—creativity doesn't work on a schedule. You know that moment when inspiration hits and you need to see your idea come to life *right now*? That's exactly when Veo3 Fast shines. While other tools make you wait 10+ minutes for a single video, Veo3 Fast delivers 720p videos with synced audio in just 2-3 minutes. That's fast enough to keep up with your racing thoughts.

**Here's what makes it psychologically satisfying:** When you're in flow state, interruptions kill creativity. Veo3 Fast eliminates that painful waiting period where your excitement fades and doubt creeps in. You prompt it, grab a coffee, and boom—your idea is moving on screen.

# The Real Talk: What It Actually Costs

Nobody talks about this honestly, but let's break down the psychology of AI video pricing. Most creators get sticker shock and either go broke or give up entirely. Veo3 Fast is designed around a simple truth: you need to fail cheaply to succeed expensively.

At roughly $0.40 per 8-second video with audio, you can experiment without the mental pressure of ""this better be perfect because I just spent $30."" Compare that to standard Veo3 at $2.00+ per video, and suddenly you're not afraid to try that wild idea that might not work.

**The psychological win:** When tools are affordable, you stop overthinking and start creating. That's when the magic happens.

# Your Step-by-Step Success Blueprint

**Start Smart, Not Perfect**  
Don't fall into the perfectionist trap that kills 90% of creators before they even begin. Here's your psychological hack: treat your first 10 videos as learning experiments, not masterpieces.

1. **Open Veo3 Fast and select your aspect ratio** (9:16 for TikTok/Instagram, 16:9 for YouTube)
2. **Write a simple, specific prompt**: ""A woman in her 30s sits at a café, looks at camera and says: 'This changed everything.' Natural lighting, coffee shop background sounds, no subtitles.""
3. **Hit generate and resist the urge to overthink** while it processes

**The Psychology Behind Great Prompts**  
Your brain wants to overcomplicate things, but Veo3 Fast responds better to clarity than complexity. Think like you're describing a scene to a friend, not writing a screenplay. Include these elements:

* **Who** (specific character description)
* **What they're doing** (one clear action)
* **Where** (simple setting)
* **What they say** (under 20 words for perfect sync)
* **The vibe** (lighting/mood)

# The Hidden Psychology of Success

Here's what nobody tells you: the difference between creators who succeed and those who quit isn't talent—it's iteration speed. Veo3 Fast lets you test 5 ideas in the time it takes other tools to produce one. This creates a psychological feedback loop that builds confidence instead of destroying it.

**Avoid the $1,500 Mistake:** One Reddit user burned through their entire budget because they treated every generation like their final masterpiece. Instead, use Veo3 Fast for your ""rough drafts""—test concepts, nail timing, perfect your prompt style. Save the expensive, high-res generations for ideas you've already validated.

# Real-World Creative Workflows

**For Social Media Creators:** Use Veo3 Fast to batch-create multiple hook variations. Test which opening line gets the most engagement, then use that data to inform your premium content.

**For Businesses:** Create rapid prototypes of ad concepts. Show three different approaches to your client before investing in final production. Your client sees options, you save money, everyone wins.

**For Storytellers:** Break complex narratives into 8-second scenes. Veo3 Fast makes it economical to test each beat of your story individually.

# The Limitations That Make You Stronger

Here's the counterintuitive truth: Veo3 Fast's limitations actually make you a better creator. The 8-second constraint forces you to distill ideas to their essence. The 720p resolution keeps you focused on storytelling over pixel-perfect visuals. These aren't bugs—they're features that train your creative instincts.

**Character consistency can be tricky**, but here's the psychological reframe: instead of seeing it as a limitation, use it as a creative challenge. Save detailed character descriptions as templates and refine them based on what works.

# Why This Matters Beyond Just Making Videos

Veo3 Fast represents something deeper: democratized creativity without the traditional gatekeepers of budget, technical skills, or industry connections. It's not just about making videos—it's about proving to yourself that your ideas have value, that your voice deserves to be heard.

When tools are fast, affordable, and intuitive, the only thing standing between you and your creative vision is... well, you. And honestly? That's exactly how it should be.

**The bottom line:** Veo3 Fast isn't perfect, but it's perfectly designed for the messy, iterative, beautifully imperfect process of human creativity. It meets you where you are—curious, maybe a little impatient, definitely ready to see your ideas come alive—and it does it without breaking your bank account or your creative spirit.

1nm47nh,https://v.redd.it/73w2acl1ucqf1,Their appetite seems to have returned,"It's not unusual for foster kittens to have parasites, but I've never had an entire litter be totally fine for a few weeks, only to [suddenly stop eating and start spraying vomit and diarrhea everywhere.](https://youtube.com/shorts/Z-SqTl4URXY?feature=share) It was so sudden that I was initially worried that it was because they'd eaten so much of a peacock feather they should not have been able to get to. (One of a big bunch had fallen between my desk and the high book case they were on.)

I took them to the Oregon Humane Society last Caturday for a checkup. Initially, they only gave Cerenia to Orange, as he was the only one that looked dehydrated. But I explained that was just because he was the only one who made a big fuss when [I tried to give subcutaneous fluids](https://youtube.com/shorts/WwSBMjR1SPc?feature=share), and that *everyone* was vomiting several times a day. The tech who brought them back explained they only did Orange at first because those shots really burn, so they try to avoid them when they can.

[They sent us home with Panacur](https://youtube.com/shorts/FufaCdCfles?feature=share), and after two days, the vomiting stopped, their poops started to solidify, and their appetite returned. But then two days after we finished a five-day course, the diarrhea came back with a vengeance. I'm currently waiting to hear back from the med team.

Last night, Yellow expelled a greater volume of liquid diarrhea than I would have thought such a tiny kitten could hold all over Harpo's handsome head. Oh well, better she do it on a [blanket](https://rainsurname.threadless.com/designs/harpo-says-keep-calm-and-carry-on/home/blanket/fleece-blanket) that can be quickly scooped up, hosed off, and laundered. 

With pee, there will *always* be enough pee smell for other cats and some people to notice. But with diarrhea, the odor that remains is so faint that even my bionic nose can barely detect it, and it doesn't actually smell like poop. It's not even a bad smell. It's like ocean water. If I still worked at Caltech, I'd have put something in a mass spectrometer by now to satisfy my curiosity. 

[Red and Blue, the big void boys, ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOgF2WjESUB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)were supposed to go back to the shelter Monday. That got pushed back to Friday to let them finish the Panacur. Now it's been pushed back again, because Blue dropped under 2 pounds. So now it will be this upcoming Thursday.

Poor Yellow actually weighs less now than she did 16 days ago. She's barely over a pound at 9 weeks. She never lost her appetite completely like the others did, and was as ravenous as ever after a couple days. She just can't gain when so much of her food goes straight through her. But she has been in good spirits for most of this time. She was kind of meh last night, but brightened right up after I gave her some fluids.

Note im not talking about refusing to fill for purely the reason of pt being a dick, just release it to them at the counter.

When i worked at the Starbucks department of my current company we had a right to refuse service to anyone for any reason which would hopefully prevent the difficult customers from coming back because they wouldnt get their coffee.

Now that I work in the pharmacy I understand things are different, but I wonder where the line is drawn. 

Im specifically talking about valid prescriptions, not controlled, or any issues like that, just the pt is being a dick to me or my coworkers can i say ""we have filled your prescription, but youve been so rude that no one here wants to deal with you, so until you apologize no one will help you"" is that crossing a legal line?

I know some companies might have different policies, and we may be at risk of being fired, but is it illegal for a technician (or group of technicians) to do that?

I imagine we can't conspire against the pt, but if they pissed off one of us, the probably did so to the others too.

If we are able to do this does that change at all for the pharmacist on duty? Are they held to different standards?

1nm4721,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1nm4721/major_nsv_im_so_proud_of_how_my_weight_loss_has/,Major NSV: I'm so proud of how my weight loss has helped my friends too!,"After I 'discovered' CICO, and started losing weight, three of my friends have hopped on the bandwagon too. It's been slow and steady but we're all at the midpoints of our BMIs now and maintaining. I'm so proud to have helped them and to have shared science-based weightless instead of all the crap misinformation we've been fed for years.

I was a teen in the late 90s and early 2000s and we were all brought up (like many generations I guess) with a lot of diet misinformation. Weight loss was all about exercise and calorie counting=eating disorder. At most, a low-fat diet (that left one feeling deprived and generally crummy) was lightly tolerated as 'healthy'.

Fast forward to our 40s and everyone has been picking up a few kilos (for me it was around 20kg/40lbs lol). We're all healthy eaters and active people so it was seen as just being one of those things that is inevitable as you age. My doctor even said so! This weight gain was concurrent with a second wave of misinformation came from Instagram influencers who said things like all weight loss was disordered eating and things about accepting your setpoint no matter your weight, etc. so I had pretty much resigned myself to my weight.

My turning point came when I read a blog by a guy who said that despite his wife and daughter telling him he had an eating disorder just because he was calorie counting (which he very obviously didn't), had lost weight using an app. I downloaded Cronometer, found this incredible subreddit (thank you all, couldn't have done it without you, especially during the plateaus) and went from 2 points away from an obese BMI to the middle range of normal today (took one year).

As my friends noticed my weightloss, they asked about it and I shared the info with them (how to use and app and a list of advice advice I've copied below). And it worked (of course) with everyone! Great thing is that you don't need to believe in CICO for it to be true. It kinda makes me sad that we had so much misinformation that understanding CICO and seeing it work was a revelation.

As people who eat healthily and live active lifestyles it hasn't been a huge overhaul but rather a couple of tweaks. I suggested that they track calories (extremely accurately- no 'handfulls' of nuts) for a week to see what the high calorie parts of their diet were. For me, I was adding on over 500 cal a day with my daily peanut butter spoons and two glasses of wine habit. Another friend found it was her healthy trail mix snacking (450 cal) that was doing it. For one it was the cream in her multiple coffees (400 cals over) and for the third it was also wine and snacks. Everyone was delighted that it didn't mean cutting out anything but just being within that calorie budget.

I just feel so proud of all of us and so happy that we could do it in a healthy, scientific way after all those years of misinformation.

There are still some people (especially family) who are convinced that what I am doing is disordered eating just because of the calorie counting but it's been so wonderful to have some friends who see that it's not and have come on the journey with me!

(To confirm that my eating is not disordered: I've always had a great body image, even at my highest weight. But seeing my BMI so close to obese was a major wakeup call for my health. I started this journey to get to a normal BMI before fertility treatment, and I have a very healthy relationship with my body and food.)

I know so many people have had difficult, unsupportive experiences with their loved ones during weightloss so I just wanted to share this win!

P.S.as well a suggesting they use an app, this was the list I sent them, of some of my favorite things all gleaned from this subreddit):

•Start poorly, start slowly but start
•Walking is a cheat code
•Nothing tastes as good as the first and last bite
•Volume eating
•Can't outrun a bad diet
•All calories are the same for weight-loss. Healthy food can be high calorie and you can lose weight by eating only fast food (though not that much -calories from a burger will not make you feel full)
•Honest and consistent tracking is crucial 
•Weigh-in everyday to ride out fluctuations 
•Hunger= tells you how soon not how much you need to eat
°Hunger isn't an emergency 
•Mediocre is better than nothing (for exercise as well)
•Find out major culprits 
• Waist or waste (if you need to throw out food you can waste it on your waist or put in in the waste)
•Eat veggies first at each meal
• Trying to lose weight while drinking booze is like swimming with weights on 
• loosing weight it hard. Being overweight is hard. Pick your hard.
•Don't eliminate things - find substitutes or different ways of enjoying your treats
•Compare calorie deficit to financial budget 
•Eating the same foods can make things easier and help with decision fatigue 
•Log on 'bad' days. But don't make up for them. Just log and move on. It's good data!
•Don't drink your calories 
•Log it and get over it
•No such thing mysterious plateau that lasts more than 3 weeks, it's because you're not at a deficit!
•You are probably thirsty not hungry 
•Have an emergency meal you like ready. Must have good snacks in car as well.
•Try eating a little slower
•Be 80% full
•Fibre is cheat code
• The store is your store. You can always go out and buy it. You don't need to keep it at home.
•You already know what it tastes like
•Mindset thing for shorties: If you're short with a low a TDEE, it's not unfair, it's just eating your share.
•7700cal = 1kg of weight (to burn or to gain)
-Adjust TDEE as you lose weight

1nm4639,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm4639,3 day itinerary in Paris (August 2025),"My wife and I spent 3 days and nights in Paris this August, and had the most magical time. Sharing our itinerary for the 3 days, we stayed in La Marais (3rd and 4th arrondissement). For the most part, our trip was agenda free (except the Louvre on the last day) and we were able to make the most of our location and plan our day as we went along.

  
Day 1 (Aug 11): Arrived around noon, flying in from Istanbul to CDG. Taxi ride to our hotel, Turenne Le Marais, which was very well located and just off the main street (Rue Saint-Antoine). The hotel room was tiny, but clean and had AC. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and we were there for location anyway. After freshening up, we went out to explore the neighborhood, turning into random streets and corners before ending up at a beautiful courtyard which is part of Cour et Jardin de l'Hôtel de Sully. Continued exploring and ended up at a lovely spot called Ma Bourgogne where we enjoyed some charcuterie and aperol spritzes. We then walked through the Place des Vosques (really nice 17th century square) and made our way to a wine bar called Magnum Le Cave, across Rue Saint-Antoine, where we had some nice wine. After that we had dinner at a place called La Place Royale next to Place des Vosques. THe place was nice, but the service was EXTREMELY slow (took over an hour to get hour food) and the food was so-so. Determined not to end our night on a low, we walked down to the Seine (5 minute walk from our hotel) and ended up at a no frills riverside bar called Les Nautes. We grabbed some wine and sat on the steps next to the river and just chilled there for a few hours, people watching (place was full of locals of all ages, and live musicians playing somewhere) and it was was so dreamy and magical. After that, back to our hotel.

  
Day 2 (Aug 12): Had breakfast at a brunch place near the hotel called Au Bouquet Saint Paul where we enjoyed some delicious French omelettes before walking to the Saint Paul metro and taking the train to the Arc. We were a bit too early to take the stairs up to the top of the Arc, but we checked out the Arc from the ground level (stunning piece of architecture) and took photos, before taking a stroll down the Champs-Élysées and getting on the metro back to Saint Paul and our hotel. After a short rest, we headed out again, stopping for coffee at Brasserie Gisèle, and then scoping out a dinner place called Le Petit Marché next door and making an evening reservation. We then walked down to the Picasso Museum and spent a good hour or so there checking out some of Picasso's stunning works, and getting some souvenirs from the gift shop. After the museum, we did some window shopping and had some tapas at a place we came across as we were starting to feel peck-ish. Back to the hotel for a rest before evening. We then did happy hour a this lovely square next to the hotel, at a place called Le Marche, before enjoying a delicious dinner at Le Petit Marche (where we had made a reservation earlier). It was a little cramped and hot though (no ac), so we ate as fast as we could (sweat dripping down our faces lol) and made it out of there! After that, we checked out a lovely speakeasy called 1905. We ended the night back at Les Nautes by the river, where a friend of ours joined.

  
Day 3 (Aug 13): Had an early breakfast at Le Bucheron on Rue Saint-Antoine before taking the metro from Saint Paul to the Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre station for our Louvre visit. We made out way to the Louvre underground entrance from the metro station before lining up in front of the inverted pyramid (we had 9AM timed tickets). After making it through security, we made a bee line for Laconde to see the Mona Lisa. There was a small crown, but we were still able to get nice photos without other people photobombing. We then explored other sections (Roman, Greek, Egyptian, French crown jewels) for the next few hours before we started to feel quite exhausted. It was an amazing experience but definitely deserves at least one more trip. We did our customary museum shop visit to add to our magnet collection, before taking the metro back to Saint Paul. We had some time to kill before our train to Munich, so stopped by Au Boquet Saint Paul again for some wine and croissants. We had checked out earlier that morning, so grabbed our luggage from the hotel concierge before taking an Uber to Gare de l'Est for our train (TGV) to Munich.

The time I asked a guy out, he literally lost his job right after. My anxious brain decided that I’m somehow cursed and now I’m scared to ask anyone out again.

Fast forward: I go to this coffee shop all the time, and the barista there is really cute. Problem is, if I shoot my shot and it’s awkward, I’ll basically have to find a new caffeine supplier because everyone there knows me and I just know they’ll gossip.

So… do I:
risk it and maybe lose my favorite coffee spot,
play it cool and keep crushing in silence,
or just slide my number on a receipt like a spy passing secret intel?

1nm44u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1nm44u1/qelbree_combination/,Qelbree Combination,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I (40f) have ADHD (combined type but more hyper active) and have terrible anxiety. I’ve tried so many meds over the past 15 years but with no luck. 

In terms of ADHD meds, I’ve tried Vyvanse, Focalin, Adderall, Ritalin IR, Strattera and Wellbutrin. All of the meds had some positives but really sucky side effects so my new provider suggested having a gene test done. I used Genesight. I found out that I’m a poor metabolizer of the 2D6 gene, which is why I had such terrible side effects with the meds I’ve tried. 

The only stimulant left to try that showed up in the green column of my test was Concerta. I was prescribed 18mg. It helped a great deal with the anxiety, some executive functioning, impulsivity and I was able to focus more. However, the drawbacks were for the first 4 hours of it in my system, I felt like a zombie and overstimulated. It completely slowed down my brain and racing thoughts but I couldn’t function. Around hour 5, that zombie haze started to lift and I felt like a normal functioning person until it wore off around hour 8. I felt like crap once it wore off. Exhausted and bad headaches. 

At my next appt, I decided to stop Concerta and I brought up Qelbree to my provider. She agreed that it was worth a try. It is in the yellow column of my gene test so we started at the lowest dosage. 

I started on Qelbree 100mg on August 23, 2025. I took it at night for 2 days and my sleep was terrible. I was able to fall asleep but I wasn’t actually fully asleep. My eyes were closed but It felt like my mind was still awake. I tossed and turned all night. It has a more stimulating/activating effect on me. So I started to take it in the morning on day 3. 

Day 1- took at night 3 hours before bed. Didn’t sleep well. Drank coffee in the morning. HUGE MISTAKE. Didn’t know you shouldnt mix caffeine with Qelbree. It made me extremely tired and I slept all day long. I was absolutely exhausted. 

Day 2- took at night 3 hours before bed. Didn’t sleep well. No coffee in the morning this time. I wasn’t as exhausted but still took a 2 hour nap after breakfast and felt tired the rest of the day. By 5pm I felt less fatigued and decided not to take it at night and would take it in the morning. 

Day 3 - took in the morning. No coffee. Felt mentally alert, less anxious but really fatigued. I could function enough to move around but felt really lazy and tired. I had to work (WFH) so I sat at my computer all day doing the absolute bare minimum. I had to force myself to do work. 

Day 4-13 - took in the morning. The fatigue was getting a tiny bit better everyday but overall I felt mentally drained from being fatigued. It did help with my anxiety in a major way, which was amazing but I felt really lazy and unmotivated. I was doing the bare minimum at work and in my life like cooking and cleaning. I noticed that I can’t eat anything with sugar in it. I get the same kind of fatigued feeling I did with the coffee. Also, I started to feel a little sad. It wasn’t a very pronounced feeling. It was sort of in the background. Like I had no particular reason to feel sad but it was a feeling I couldn’t shake. 

Day 14- I had an appt with my provider. I told her everything I experienced over the past two weeks. At that point, I wanted to give up on the med bc I just felt exhausted and drained. I know most people say the fatigue goes away in 4-6 weeks but I didn’t think I could keep going that long. On the flip side, it was amazing for my anxiety. 1000% so we agreed to increase the dosage to 200mg to test it out considering it’s the starting dosage and I was only on 100mg. 

That night I weighed the pros and cons and decided I was done. I couldn’t take the Qelbree for one more day. 

Day 15 & 16 - No Qelbree. I didn’t experience any bad side effects. I know some people say after 1 missed dose they feel like they want to die but not me. No headaches and I felt better actually. I felt like I was getting back to normal. 

Day 17- I decided to go back to Concerta. I still needed to address my anxiety and the side effects of Concerta were better than Qelbree. I took 18mg and I realized 2 hours in I never had the zombie effect. I felt pretty normal. 4 hours in I still felt normal. By the end of the day, I never got a headache. I was so confused why Concerta was different this time.  

I did some research and found that stimulants and meds like Qelbree and Straterra are good combinations. I guess the Qelbree was still in my system at the time I took the Concerta, which is why 
It felt different. 

I was able to address this with my provider so I’ve  been on the combination of Concerta and Qelbree for almost 2 weeks now. I take 100mg of Qelbree and 36mg of Concerta in the morning. They seem to cancel out/lessen the worst of the side effects of each other. I still feel a tiny bit fatigued and a little unmotivated on some days but I can function normally for the most part with work and life. I have more focus and feel more productive while the Concerta is working. I don’t really feel the Concerta wearing off at the end of the day either. I can just tell by a difference in my mood. I get a little more hyperactive. 

I still cannot drink coffee or eat any sugar without getting extremely fatigued. It’s hard to remove sugar completely out of my diet but I noticed if I wait to eat a fruit cup or a snack bar later in the day after lunch, the fatigue is not as bad. 

TLDR: Concerta by itself - Felt like a zombie for the first 4 hours. Felt like a normal person for the last 4 hours. Helped with ADHD and some anxiety but exhausted and headachey when it wore off. 

Qelbree by itself - Extreme fatigue, unmotivated, lazy and some feelings of sadness. Didn’t help with ADHD but It helped 1000% with anxiety. 

Concerta in combination with Qelbree. Together they work. They seem to cancel out/lessen the worst of the side effects. I can function more normally. Less fatigue, less zombie, no headaches when Concerta wears off. More focus and more productivity.  It’s not 100% perfect bc I still feel unmotivated at certain times of the day but I feel way better than I did before. 

I hope this helps anyone struggling to figure out the issues with Qelbree and/or stimulants. ",1,1758389176.0,qelbree,0,1.0,False

I am on a bus hike returning. I spoke with an English lady named Sansa at length and we enjoyed talking. At one point of the hike, a washroom came and she said I will be right back. By the time she returned I was talking with another person. Then a group photo was taken, and I started talking with 2 other girls.  Sansa started talking with another woman. And then in another 10 min we reached the starting point of the hike which meant we had to get on the bus to return to the actual starting point where we all met. 

Just before getting on the bus, I stood beside her and asked how’s it going and she said good, and then we had to continue listening to the announcement that the leader was making. Once the leader was done and we were supposed to get on the bus , I said to her , “we left our conversation at union” and she said oh, took a time to recall and said something. Then I asked would you like to take this conversation forward and asked her number , and she punched it in my phone. I sent her a text before getting on the bus. 

Next is we got on the bus. I wanted to sit beside her and continue talking. But I thought it would be rude since she might want to be alone on her way back and enjoy the ride peacefully. Another reason is I could have bored her on the ride back and she might have said no to meeting me later. 

I am on the bus right like just everyone.

1nm3zb9,https://i.redd.it/ecrx255qscqf1.jpeg,the two year anniversaries to my suicide attempts are coming up. thinking about them too much,"trigger warnings for suicide and paranoia or delusional thinking whatever maybe. i know im not being delusional but i know other people will think it.

the second one keeps looping in my head. the first wasn’t that bad, i took a walk and listened to music and cried and i hugged my siblings goodbye and i tied the noose and hung it on my doorknob and i put my neck in and i remember it hurt when it started pulling. i wasnt brave enough so i gave up, scrambled myself out of it. had some ‘epiphany’ about how life was worth living for the little things. it didnt last. couldnt in the fucking situation i was in with my fucking family. i looked in the mirror to make sure my neck wasnt bruised. it was red but it didnt leave a mark. it didnt. went to bed. i dont remember the day after that or the week after or the month after aside from christmas. it was my least favorite christmas

my second attempt was a little after new years. i did the same thing, went on a walk and cried and listened to my favorite music. i remember thinking the christmas lights were still pretty on peoples balconies. they hadnt taken them down yet. i forgot my shoes and the ground was cold when i stepped on it. there was snow on the ground, i think. i dont remember any of it very well anymore.

the roads i had to cross had no cars. i wish they did so i couldve just jumped infront of one and actually died. wouldve actually worked because once you jump youre just dead. you cant back out. youre just gone. i took a walk by a cliff. i thought about jumping but the thought scared me and it was a bumpy way down.

i thought about standing on the edge and someone coming by and talking with me, maybe sitting on the bench a few steps away and having a smoke. i didnt climb over the fence and everybody i walked by kept their head down. i felt alone. it was peaceful but it hurt

i remember looking up some youtube tutorial for my noose because i didnt remember how to tie it. i wondered if the person who made the video would feel guilty if they knew i died with help from their tutorial. i felt bad for my siblings. i know they wouldnt miss me once they realized they were better off without me but i knew the initial grief would hurt. they were the only people who were nice to me. my parents were too busy judging me for my weight and treating me like a dog to argue with or a tool solely to help parent my siblings. i didnt feel bad for them. i wanted them to hurt. i wrote my note and i blamed them, let out my frustration, called them horrible and said it was all their fault. i want to feel bad for it nowadays but i dont. i know im a bad person for it.

i put my head in the noose again and i found it weird how my thoughts just stopped. i expected to see my life flash before my eyes but all i really thought about was if anyone would see me from their apartments. my window was open and it was nighttime and my lights were on. i know they could see me if they were looking. i dont think anyone did because there were no cops but sometimes i still wonder. maybe they didnt know the apartment number. i dont know. i remember my room. the carpet. my mattress, stained and sheetless because i didnt have enough energy to put it on. the trash under it my mother screamed at me for.

she didnt even try to feel empathetic. i was zoning out and crying and i never had enough mental strength eat or clean or do anything and all they did was fucking judge me and weigh me and threaten me with inpatient facilities. i wasnt anorexic i was just too depressed because of how they just stopped caring at me to even try eating.

i remember the old coffee cups on my table that were rotting and i still couldnt bring myself to do anything. i saw it but i didnt think about it if that makes sense. i dont know how to word it. i tried screaming my mouth was open but i couldnt bring myself to make noise. it hurt. it hurt and i didnt care because i knew it was over and there was so much pressure and my vision started going black and the rope fucking broke of fucking course because i cant have fucking anything anymore. i just kneeled on the ground and breathed. i couldnt comprehend what happened because it was too much and i was too young to process it. i feel so sick

i cant look at snow anymore without feeling sick or listen to my comfort songs from then without feeling sick or cry without feeling sick. i can still feel it around my neck and its too tight.

i find it weird how my birthday and my two suicide attempts were both on tuesday. its always been a really important day to me for some reason even before i knew it was my birthday weekday. it felt special. i know everyone is going to call me sick and delusional but i still believe i died and i went to hell or some sort of afterlife for it.

maybe im being tested on or something. i dont know. i think about how my family reacted in real life a lot. my siblings were concerned about my mental health at the time. i wonder if they blamed themselves for not pushing more. theyre still here in this hell but i know theyre different versions of themselves. its not the old ‘them’ i knew. theyre the same but theyre different. i dont like thinking about it. theres too many coincidences for it to be real life. everything just feels fake. i know im not real in the normal sense. im afraid",4,1758388813.0,MadeOfStyrofoam,2,1.0,False
1nm3xwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nm3xwv/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Evaluate the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Classic Review,"Testing the Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker (model K-50) has become part of my morning rituals, and I could write an entire chapter of my life with this machine as a central character. Armed with the ability to brew coffee in three distinct sizes and offering the elegance of a removable 48oz water reservoir, it feels tailored for those of us who need caffeine to function like a human. Let's dive into what I love, and a few hiccups, about this coffee wizard.

**Design and Build Quality**  

The sleek black finish of the Keurig K-Classic is more than just visually pleasing; it blends effortlessly with almost any kitchen decor, making it the kind of appliance you'd want to leave on the counter. Compact yet sturdy, it doesn’t take up much space, which matters to someone like me who somehow has a tiny apartment but too many gadgets. Having tested it daily, I also appreciate its convenient button controls. Everything about the design, from its lightweight frame to its intuitive interface, screams functionality. That said, while the plastic build is durable, it doesn’t feel overly premium—functional yet unremarkable.

**Brewing Experience**  

Making coffee with the Keurig K-Classic is refreshingly simple. Pop in your favorite K-Cup pod, press a button, and that's it—your coffee is ready in under a minute. The three brewing sizes (6, 8, and 10 ounces) let you tweak your cup's strength; I discovered that the smaller size gives a punchier flavor. It’s perfect for mornings when my head feels heavier than a bag of bricks. Still, if you prefer a specific custom brew strength, you might miss not having advanced coffee calibration settings.

[Check Keurig K-50 price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b018uq5ams/)

**Ease of Maintenance**  

Maintaining this coffee maker is a breeze. The removable water reservoir makes refilling easy. Cleaning it is equally hassle-free, with the descaling process ensuring calcium build-up is kept at bay. Regular descaling does require some effort, though, especially if you're someone (like me) who often forgets cleaning schedules. The machine also includes an auto-off feature, turning itself off after two hours, a blessing for saving energy and for absent-minded folks who can’t remember if they’ve turned off appliances.

**Strengths**  

- Straightforward button controls for quick brewing  
- Large removable water reservoir brews multiple cups before refilling  
- Attractive design that complements compact spaces  
- Auto-off feature for energy efficiency  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- Plastic build makes it feel less premium  
- Lacks advanced brewing customization for dedicated coffee enthusiasts  
- The descaling process isn’t as intuitive without consulting the manual  

**Peer Products**  

Comparing the Keurig K-Classic to its competitors, several factors stand out. Against the Nespresso Vertuo, the Keurig offers more brewing size flexibility and compatibility with every kind of K-Cup pod under the sun. Nespresso, for all its charm, often locks users into its own pod ecosystem. However, the Vertuo surpasses the Keurig in terms of rich espresso flavor and frothy crema, so if you're an espresso die-hard, the Vertuo might tempt you more. Another rival, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, does an excellent job offering both pod and ground coffee options, but it’s slower and bulkier, which knocks it down a peg for those in a rush. The Keurig K-Classic wins on speed and simplicity, holding its own in the crowded world of coffee makers.

**Price Performance**  

This coffee maker falls into a sweet spot in terms of affordability and features. It’s not the most high-tech or premium choice out there, but it earns its keep through sheer reliability and ease of use. The combination of convenience, speed, and decent coffee quality for the price range makes it an excellent option for casual coffee lovers. While hardcore coffee aficionados may demand extra bells and whistles, for most households, it’s the dependable companion you didn’t know you needed.

1nm3xit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AccountingPH/comments/1nm3xit/manila_experienced_us_income_tax_preparers/,Manila - Experienced US Income Tax Preparers,"Hi all! Not sure if this is a good idea, so I created this burn account to take a chance lol. 

Background:
I am in a leadership position at a US-based firm that has been working with TOA Global for ~5 years. Our firm, founded in 2020, does outsourced tax/accounting/FP&A for US-based clients. I was the first employee at this company and I’m now a Partner with almost 30 full-time teammates. Since my first day, I worked closely with our TOA team in Clark and have grown that team from 0 to ~17. Im so thankful for them and the role that they play on our Accounting Team - they work hard and play hard (work hard comes first), and I feel they can go head-to-head with US bookkeepers. I truly believe that they are happier working with us than their previous jobs.

My Pain Point:
Since late last year, I’ve been trying to build out an offshore ‘US Tax’ Team, but it’s been very challenging finding offshore talent with RELEVANT US tax experience (not bookkeeping experience, not audit experience, not BIR/VAT experience). We explored Philippines, South America, and most recently, we started working with a firm in India but so far, the Indian BPO company has been a bit…underwhelming. I want to reconsider TOA again for the tax team. However, I want to build this tax team at TOA’s Manila office rather than in Clark. We got very lucky with one TOA tax candidate earlier in the year who came from PWC’s US tax team. Unfortunately, she had to resign soon after starting due to some medical condition I think (idk b/c she ghosted us/TOA), but at least I know what I’m looking for is a possibility in Manila. 

My Goals with this Post:
Trying to communicate what I’m looking for through the Talent/Recruiters feels like my reach is limited, so I’m trying to connect directly with talented professionals in case there are synergies. 
I come to Manila every year in Q4, and I shuttle my entire team from Clark to Makati for a weekend of fun (they deserve it b/c they work really hard all year). During this weekend, I put them up in hotel rooms, pay for nice brunches and dinners, and we all party hard together (I don’t peer pressure! But I think they peer pressure each other lol). 
This year, our outing is the end of October 2025. But due to flight limitations, I’ll be stuck in Makati until Tuesday night. I figure i could make the best of Sunday-Tuesday trying to network with experienced tax professionals (open to breakfast, coffee chat, happy hour, dinner, zoom call, etc - idk I just came up with this idea right now).  Best case scenario, our goals align and we have a job for you in January 2026. Worst case, we have a great chat and I learn a bit more about the industry in PH. If a job offer seems plausible, I would want to introduce you to TOA specifically to work for my firm. We would want you to start in January 2026 at the latest, but TOA would probably need to start their onboarding process in November/December 2025.
If this interests you, shoot me a DM with your elevator pitch. To save you time, here are some (not all) requirements:

About You:
-CPA preferred
-big 4 experience preferred
-CCH Axcess experience preferred
-[required] have at least 1 year of US Income Tax experience (either 1040 or 1120/1065), but the more the better
-leaderships potential [since the team will grow]
-must be okay reporting onsite to TOA’s Manila office, for night shift, every day (at this point in the business, day shift is not possible, but there is opportunity to WFH full time or hybrid after you’ve been with the firm for 1.5 years and been promoted once - this way, we can trust that you’re responsible enough to work offsite w/o supervision)
-must not be an asshole
-must be okay working with us through TOA (we’re unable to hire you directly)

Compensation:
When it comes to Compensation, I usually just let you handle that with TOA. From what I’ve seen, TOA is competitive with your current job. We provide generous bonuses, especially for the high performing TOA teammates. If you want references, I can intro you to my current TOA teammates for a follow up conversation on what it’s been like, but note that you’d be on a new/separate team from them.

1nm3x8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nm3x8r/coferment_conundrum/,Coferment Conundrum,"Hello all seeking some advice/sanity check. I've been trying to brew a Mango Coferment from black and white in a v60 to a mixed bag of results. I've been trying to use a 4:6 approach 20g in 300 out. 1:15. Coarse grind. 93c water. Which is what I have used for most lightly roasted coffees and wasn't loving what I getting out of it despite playing with the grind size. I remembered I still had a recipe card from Glitch which they use on alot of their heavily processed coffees. 15g in 260 out 1:17ish with a fine grind and pretty low temp at 86c. When I brewed it I absentmindedly used too much of a dose of coffee, 20g, not realizing until I was done. Which resulted in a 1:13 ratio. I was pretty frustrated expecting it to taste terrible. But it was actually super good. Pleasant bright acidity and a lot of mango flavor.

I spoke with an English lady named Sansa at length and we enjoyed talking. At one point of the hike, a washroom came and she said I will be right back. By the time she returned I was talking with another person. Then a group photo was taken, and I started talking with 2 other girls.  Sansa started talking with another woman. And then in another 10 min we reached the starting point of the hike which meant we had to get on the bus to return to the actual starting point where we all met. 

Just before getting on the bus, I stood beside her and asked how’s it going and she said good, and then we had to continue listening to the announcement that the leader was making. Once the leader was done and we were supposed to get on the bus , I said to her , “we left our conversation at union” and she said oh, took a time to recall and said something. Then I asked would you like to take this conversation forward and asked her number , and she punched it in my phone. I sent her a text before getting on the bus. 

Next is we got on the bus. I wanted to sit beside her and continue talking. But I thought it would be rude since she might want to be alone on her way back and enjoy the ride peacefully. Another reason is I could have bored her on the ride back and she might have said no to meeting me later. 

I am on the bus right like just everyone.  

What should I had done? Should I had asked her if I can sit beside her and sat beside her? 

I thought I would come off as desperate if I asked to sit beside her and talk with her all the way back.

She’s on the bus too and has not responded to my message yet. Obviously she has checked her phone many a times by now, because , well , everybody does on bus rides. 

I am not sitting beside her right now. 

My next window of opportunity is when we get down the bus. 

Should I just ask her out as soon as we get down. Should I say - “I enjoyed talking with you. I find you attractive. Can we meet for a coffee sometime so that I get to know you more?”",4,1758388571.0,dating,18,1.0,False

**What this post is**

I am sharing a longform article I have been writing for six to seven months. I map how money, companies, and authorities combine to create what I call a cultivated oversight gap. This is an accountability project. I am explicit about my aim to surface and scrutinize the role of Veritas Capital and Brown Brothers Harriman in building and maintaining that gap for government-adjacent work. The full piece is far too long for Reddit, so below is a plain summary with a high level view of the findings. Full citations and detail are here:

https://burningrob.substack.com/p/sub-rosa-organized-secrecy

**Why I wrote it**

I kept seeing a lot of big claims with very thin sourcing and, at the same time, plenty of strong evidence that was not being connected clearly. My goal is to separate what is documented from what is not, show people the pipes that money and contracts run through, and invite the community to pressure test the argument. I had to learn a great deal in order to write this, and am, like all humans, still learning more every day. This project was an expression of that desire to know more about the world around us. 

**What I actually claim**

My central claim is that we are dealing with a repeatable architecture that is carefully insulated from public oversight. It relies on concentrated private ownership of key contractors, private bank custodianship that operates outside normal audit trails, and serial rollups and rebrands that move people, contracts, and intellectual property while lowering visibility. Public money can commingle with private capital inside this structure, which preserves deniability and continuity behind cut outs and proprietaries. In this article I treat Veritas Capital and Brown Brothers Harriman as a live case, and likely a central component of the Legacy Program. Veritas functions as a control node across a defense and intelligence portfolio, and Brown Brothers Harriman functions as the circulatory system that keeps the money opaque. Together they illustrate how a cultivated oversight gap can and has been engineered and maintained.

I also lay out an allegation about Kona Blue. I argue that the attempted transfer did not simply die on interagency objections, and I present dates and transactions that suggest Veritas-linked entities and Brown Brothers Harriman custody could have provided the private side rails for continuity. I trace a plausible path for sensitive materials and work product from the Lockheed Enterprise Integration Group, through The SI Organization, to Vencore, to Perspecta, to Peraton, with related spinoffs such as Arcfield. I am not claiming that every hop is proven to carry the same physical materials. I am claiming that the custody and corporate control needed to shelter Kona Blue-related holdings existed at the right moments, and that this private architecture is exactly what you would use if you wanted continuity without attention.

**Method and sources**

I use corporate filings, merger documents, contractor lineages, investor materials, historical records, and open reporting. I match those against interviews and researcher leads, some of which I personally took part in over the last two years. Where a claim relies on a non-traditional or not fully vetted source, I say so. Where a claim rests on documents, I say that too. If I fail to do so, please inform me and I will correct it.

**How to read this post**

Skim the summaries to find the parts of the article you may care about. If you want to go deeper, the link has the long version with references. I will try my best to be in the thread to answer questions and make corrections if you show me better sources.

***

**1) Skull and Ledger**

I begin with a short primer on how we got here. The pattern is older than any single program. World War II and early Cold War practice created the template: elite private banks handling custody and foreign exchange for government-linked activity, industrial houses providing deniable platforms, and proprietaries that blended commercial form with covert function. Non-official cover rode airlines, trading firms, and engineering shops. Postwar special projects like Big Safari normalized rapid contracting, out-of-cycle funding, and contractor-led sustainment for highly sensitive capabilities. The point is not nostalgia. It is lineage. The same levers exist today in updated wrappers. If you understand how banks, cut outs, and privileged contracting used to work, you will recognize the modern architecture when you see it.

**2) A Mask, Not a Face**

Here I profile Veritas Capital as the owner layer that makes continuity possible without constant attention. Veritas focuses on companies serving the military, intelligence community, and government technology. Its portfolio has included or includes Peraton, Guidehouse, Cubic, Alion Science, and DynCorp International. Leadership benches and advisory boards draw heavily from former generals, admirals, CIA officers, and Pentagon officials, which gives the firm unusual access inside the system it invests in. The public profile is intentionally small. Veritas rarely issues press releases, its CEO rarely gives interviews, and the firm often uses acquisition vehicles that keep attention on operating brands rather than the owner. That is the mask. The brand is the face.

**3) Face Down, Deal Again**

This is the corporate lineage walkthrough and the method it demonstrates. The path is familiar to readers here: Lockheed’s Enterprise Integration Group to The SI Organization to Vencore to Perspecta to Peraton, with related spinoffs such as Arcfield. The important details are procedural. Contract novations under FAR 42.12 keep performance continuous even as the counterparty name changes. CAGE codes, DD254s, and facility clearances can be transitioned so that classified work does not pause. Transition service agreements move data, tooling, and personnel under controlled schedules. Each hop provides a fresh wrapper, a reset of disclosure baselines, and a new place to park sensitive artifacts. I argue this is financial cloaking at scale. If you wanted continuity without attention, you would do it exactly this way.

**4) Kona Blue**

Readers here know the basics, so I will be direct. The attempt in 2010 to formalize Kona Blue reached the PSAP stage, meaning a proposed special access program that had a sponsor, a draft security concept, and a path to a cognizant authority, but lacked final establishment and code assignment. In practice, PSAP status allows limited planning activity under draft compartments and prospective access rosters while the SAP approval chain works or stalls.

My claim is twofold. First, the interagency pushback did not simply kill the effort in a clean way. Second, the private architecture existed to preserve continuity without a fully established SAP. I lay out how custody and work product could ride private side rails while PSAP approval languished. The path is one many may not be aware of: Lockheed’s Enterprise Integration Group to The SI Organization to Vencore to Perspecta to Peraton, with related spinoffs like Arcfield. Each hop provides a fresh wrapper, a new set of transition service agreements, and a place to park personnel, contracts, and artifacts while reducing surface area.

I am not asking you to accept that every item labeled Kona Blue moved intact across each step. I am asking you to look at the timing and the control points. A PSAP that is not greenlit still generates planning artifacts, draft MOUs, and prospective access rosters. Those do not evaporate. In a portfolio controlled by Veritas Capital and custodied by Brown Brothers Harriman, there is a ready-made route to keep sensitive holdings alive inside contractor networks, outside ordinary audit trails, until conditions change. That is the mechanism.

**5) Gatekeeper, Keymaster**

Now I go into the financial plumbing that makes the above viable. A global custodian bank holds fund assets, runs foreign exchange, maintains cash accounts, and services capital calls and distributions. Subscription credit lines extend short-term leverage against uncalled LP commitments, which smooths capital timing and obscures cash-flow footprints. Limited partnership agreements and side letters set confidentiality, valuation policies, and reporting cadence. Inside that stack, public dollars can commingle with private capital and still remain outside ordinary public records. In the article I profile Brown Brothers Harriman in this role for Veritas funds. My claim is direct. The bank rails are the gatekeeper. The portfolio manager is the keymaster. Together they define who can see what, when, and at what level of aggregation.

**6) By their returns you shall know them**

Here I explain who likely supplies the money and why governance, not marketing, is the thing to look at. A meaningful portion of this funding can come from ordinary Americans through public employee pension plans and fund-of-funds inside 401(k) menus, alongside family offices and mission-adjacent capital. Investment committees sign limited partnership agreements and side letters that lock in confidentiality. Beneficiaries rarely see the exposure, and public records requests generally stop at the private-fund boundary. Custodians and general partners decide flows, valuation marks, and reporting windows. The result is an outsourced black box whose success is scored by return profiles, not by disclosure or democratic consent. When a brand becomes radioactive, the assets and people can migrate into a new wrapper and the machine keeps running while teachers, firefighters, nurses, and city workers remain financially tied to the outcome.

**7) Closed eyes, dark hearts, cannot lose**

Here I stress test the model against hard cases. When a contractor or portfolio brand becomes politically toxic, capabilities often survive through rebrand, spinout, or roll up. The legal devices are straightforward. Asset purchase agreements that carve out troubled liabilities. Successor entities that assume performance under novated contracts. Transitional use of legacy systems under service agreements while new entities stand up. Watch for continuity signals that outlast a scandal. Same key personnel in cleared billets. Same contract numbers and task orders under a new legal name. Same SCIF addresses and secure networks with freshly issued letterhead. My point is not to relitigate every scandal. My point is to show how the machine is designed to preserve the work even when labels fail.

**8) As above, so below**

I synthesize how an alleged umbrella program could be distributed across the existing contractor ecosystem. Sensor collection lives on air, space, and terrestrial platforms with program offices that already rely heavily on contractor-led integration. Analysis lives inside FedRAMP HIGH accredited cloud environments, cross-domain solutions, and data-fusion stacks that contractors already build and operate. Exploitation lives in compartmented labs with vendor-managed sustainment, all held together by Memoranda of understanding, service level agreements, and need-to-know rosters that are coordinated across agencies but executed by companies. In that world, a PSAP-level effort can persist in pieces while a formal establishment code never arrives. The practical effect is continuity without any visible center of gravity.

**9) The shape in the fog**

This is a conclusion section. Does this even merit an explanation? 

***

**What I am asking from this community**

Point me to hard records that confirm or break the chains described above. I am looking for SEC exhibits that name Brown Brothers Harriman as custodian for specific Veritas funds, merger schedules and transition services agreements in the EIG to SI to Vencore to Perspecta to Peraton path, novation documents that show how contracts moved, HSR filings, and custodian or FX agreements that clarify who held what and when. If you work in procurement, fund administration, or bank custody and see an error, tell me and cite it. If you have a better model that explains the same facts, lay it out and I will engage.

**About me**

I am Rob, a former U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion engineer (machinist’s mate). I have not worked in that field for quite a while. I have done everything from radio to making pizza. For most of my life I was convinced UFOs and aliens were not real. I got pulled into this around the time of David Grusch’s testimony, and the last two years have been a whirlwind that started right here. Friends I made in this subreddit, after chatting with posters whose work I admired, became real-life friends and helped me get personally involved in disclosure. I even ended up at the most recent hearings, but that is a story for another day. Thanks for reading. I appreciate your time, and if you choose to support my work there are options to do so but this is by no means a call for that.

Tested at home, short walk outside, and in a moderately busy cafe. 

I will not comment on fit as that depends on each individual’s ear shape. 

Passive noise isolation
APP’s default tips are far inferior to the Comply foam tips. No contest. 

ANC
Perhaps due to the huge gap in passive noise isolation, the ANC on the AirPods has a much harder job to do than the MTWs. The MTWs with the Comply foam tips result in almost complete silence. With the APPs, I hear high frequency plate clinking, sibilants in conversations around me, and the noise of coffee grinding, milk steaming, etc. It’s not loud by any means, but compared with near complete silence, the noise is definitely distracting and annoying when I’m working. It would be interesting to see when Comply releases their foam tips for APP3 if this changes. Additionally, MTWs have an anti-wind mode that sacrifices some ANC for complete removal of that annoying wind noise. It’s a small pain to activate since you need to go into the app, but when you’re outdoors it makes a massive difference. I don’t run outdoors or bike, but this would be a make-or-break difference if I did.

Sound quality and soundstage
MTWs are neutral and the stereo is precise. APPs with the sub base tuned up this generation makes the music sound more alive. I can see myself enjoying the APPs when I’m working at a cafe. Spatial Audio is available with APPs but not MTWs. Comes down to personal preference on which characteristics you prefer. For reference, I prefer the MTW4s over the Sony WF-1000XM5 and B&W Pi8s. 

Transparency
APPs sound far more natural than MTWs. Sense of depth and distance on the APPs are also far more natural. 

Quality of life features
APP conversation awareness is genuinely useful and kicks in pretty quickly, but transparency on MTWs are just a single left earbud tap. Difference is not massive. Call announcement + head gestures as a combination is more useful than having to pull out your phone and check the caller. Live translation gesture is awkward and have not had an opportunity to test. 

First Impressions so far
APP has the potential to be a noticeable upgrade to MTWs for my use cases, but only on the assumption that Comply’s foam tips will address the passive noise isolation. If you run outdoors or bike, I would highly recommend trying out the MTW4s for the anti-wind mode. ",1,1758388171.0,AirpodsPro,0,1.0,False

This is Chapter 2! Sorry!,"Hi, y'all! I wrote a ""dystopian"" novella titled ""Oh. Canada!?"" where Canada takes over the world, and yesterday I promised I'd post a chapter at a time so that r/EhBuddyHoser could get it for free. 

Here's the synopsis, since I didn't post it yesterday: 

**When Canada accidentally becomes the world's first AI superpower, everybody's sorry.**

Major Isabelle ""Belle"" Deschamps just wanted to fly fighters. But when Canada's revolutionary Mosaic AI network turns her into something between a pilot and a god, she discovers that absolute peace requires absolute control.

In one brutal demonstration at Red Flag, six Canadian CF-35s annihilate 217 allied aircraft in twelve minutes. The message is clear: the age of American air superiority is over. Welcome to the Ottawa Doctrine: global stability enforced with algorithmic precision and aggressive politeness.

But when American pilots launch a desperate analog insurgency, Belle must hunt down the very warriors she once admired. In a final duel between cutting-edge AI and raw human courage, she'll discover whether humanity's future requires sacrificing everything that made us human.

A darkly comic technothriller about the next evolution of warfare, where the most dangerous weapon isn't a missile—it's an apology.

**""Tom Clancy meets John Scalzi in the Nevada desert.""**

*Special pricing for Canadian readers. Sorry!*

So here's Chapter 2, and I'll post Chapter 3 tomorrow:

# Chapter Two: Red Flag

The heat came off the Nellis tarmac in waves that made the distant mountains shimmer like a mirage. Belle stepped down from her CF-35 and felt the Nevada sun settle on her like a physical weight. After the controlled climate of Cold Lake, it was like stepping into an oven.

The scale of American air power stretched before her: row after row of fighters baking in the desert sun. F-35s, F-16s, F-15Xs, and in their own special section, a squadron of F-22 Raptors that looked like sleeping sharks. British Typhoons, Singaporean F-15SGs, Korean KF-21 Boramaes, Australian Super Hornets—the combined might of the Western world's air forces gathered for the most realistic combat training on Earth.

In contrast, the Canadian contingent occupied a remote corner of the flight line. Six CF-35s parked in perfect alignment, their ground crews moving with quiet efficiency. They looked like a rounding error.

""Jesus,"" her wingman, Captain Marcel ""Puck"" Tremblay, muttered as he pulled off his helmet. ""We could fit our entire air force in their coffee budget.""

""Quality over quantity,"" Belle replied, though she was doing the math herself. There had to be over two hundred aircraft here.

The main briefing auditorium was ice-cold and packed to capacity. General Rex Thorne commanded the stage with the easy confidence of a man who'd never questioned American air superiority. He was everything a fighter general should be: silver temples, jaw that could cut glass, wings on his chest that included combat time over three different continents.

""Gentlemen—and ladies,"" he added with a nod toward the handful of female pilots, ""welcome to Red Flag 25-1. For our international partners joining us, you're about to experience the most realistic combat training environment in the world. We don't pull punches here. We don't play nice. If you can hack it in Vegas, you can hack it anywhere.""

Polite chuckles rippled through the crowd.

""Now, I want to extend a special welcome to our neighbors from the north."" Thorne's smile was warm but patronizing. ""The Royal Canadian Air Force is fielding their new CF-35 variant this year. General Tate, would you and your pilots stand?""

Belle rose with her five squadron mates. The room turned to look—six pilots in a sea of hundreds.

""The Canadians have always punched above their weight,"" Thorne continued. ""Hell, I flew with some of their boys in Afghanistan. Damn fine pilots. So let's make sure we give them the full Red Flag experience. Don't go easy on them just because they're polite.""

More laughter. Belle kept her expression neutral as they sat back down.

After the mass briefing, General Patrick Tate gathered his pilots in a small side room. Where Thorne had been all performance and presence, Tate was quiet precision.

""Standard doctrine today,"" he said, looking directly at Belle. ""You fly like any other CF-35 squadron. No network integration. Passive telemetry only. Clear?""

""Clear, sir,"" Belle replied.

""The exercise parameters are eight versus twelve for the morning evolution. You'll be Red Air, defending. Blue Force will be a mix of American F-35s and F-16s. Afternoon evolution, they're adding Raptors to Blue Force."" Tate paused. ""Fly well. Fly clean. Show them what Canadian pilots can do with conventional tactics.""

""General,"" Captain Tremblay raised his hand. ""Are we trying to win?""

""You're trying to fly exactly like they expect you to,"" Tate replied. ""Good pilots in good aircraft, playing by the rules.""

\*\*\*

Belle's radar warning receiver started singing thirty miles out. Four F-16 Vipers, coming in hot from the northwest. She keyed her mic.

""Goose Flight, Goose One. Bandits bearing three-two-zero, angels twenty-five. Looks like they're trying to bracket us.""

""Goose Three, tally,"" Puck replied. ""Got another four coming from the east. F-35s by the signature.""

Standard hammer and anvil. The Americans were treating this like a training evolution, which it was. Belle felt the familiar calm settle over her as she prepared for the merge.

""Goose Flight, defensive split. Two and Three with me north, Four through Six take the eastern group.""

The fight was beautiful in its simplicity. No Mosaic, no electronic warfare, just thrust vectors and energy management. Belle reversed hard into the Vipers, using the CF-35's superior nose authority to force an overshoot. Her missile lock tone was sweet and pure.

""Goose One, Fox Two.""

""SIMULATED KILL, VIPER 23, RETURN TO BASE.""

For seven minutes, the Canadians gave as good as they got. Belle watched Puck nail an F-35 with a high-aspect gun shot that was pure artistry. They were outnumbered two to one, but they were making the Americans work for it.

Then the F-22 Raptors arrived.

The change was immediate. Where the F-16s and F-35s had to respect the merge, the Raptors operated in a different realm. They stayed high, stayed fast, and launched simulated AMRAAMs from angles that Belle couldn't defend against.

She pumped chaff, went defensive, pulled almost nine Gs trying to notch the incoming missiles. But there were simply too many. One by one, her flight was picked off with clinical precision.

Belle was the last Canadian flying, defensive against two Raptors who were toying with her like cats with a mouse. She could see them on her helmet display, comfortable in their superiority, taking their time.

The kill, when it came, was almost gentle.

""SIMULATED KILL, GOOSE ONE, RETURN TO BASE.""

Belle pulled her throttle back and started her turn toward Nellis. Through her helmet display, she watched the two Raptors waggle their wings—the fighter pilot equivalent of a pat on the head.

""Not bad, Goose Lead,"" an American voice came over the exercise frequency. ""You made us work for it.""

""Copy, Raptor. Good kill."" Belle kept her voice professionally neutral. Inside, she was memorizing everything—their tactics, their formations, their communication patterns.

The afternoon evolution went similarly. Six Canadian CF-35s against increasing waves of American aircraft. They flew brilliantly, scored several kills, but the outcome was never in doubt. By the end of the day, the scoreboard was clear: Blue Force 42, Red Force 6.

\*\*\*

The Officers' Club at Nellis was trying to be Las Vegas in miniature—lots of neon, cheap glamour, and expensive drinks. General Thorne was holding court at the main bar, his voice carrying over the music.

""—and then this crazy Canuck, no offense Tate, pulls this insane high-alpha reversal in the merge! Thought her jet was going to depart controlled flight, but she held it. Must've been pulling eleven Gs!""

General Tate stood nearby, beer in hand, playing the part of the gracious defeated. ""Major Deschamps has always been creative with the flight envelope.""

Thorne clapped him on the shoulder. ""Creative is right. Hell of a pilot. They all are. You should be proud, Pat. They gave us a real fight today."" He took a swig of his whiskey. ""Stevens was saying your number three—Tremblay?—he almost got out of the engagement. If he'd had another thousand feet at the merge, might've been a different story.""

""Almost only counts in horseshoes,"" Tate replied mildly.

""And hand grenades!"" Thorne laughed. ""Look, between you and me, I was a little worried when I heard about your new integrated systems. Washington's been losing their minds about what you guys have been cooking up. But after today?"" He shrugged. ""Good pilots, good jets, but nothing we can't handle. The Raptor is still king of the hill.""

Belle stood at the far end of the bar, nursing a Molson that someone had found specifically for the Canadians. She watched the exchange between the generals, saw Thorne's casual dismissal of their capabilities.

""Your boss is taking it well,"" Captain Lisa ""Frost"" Chen said, sliding up beside her.

""He's a patient man,"" Belle replied.

Across the room, an F-15 pilot was regaling his squadron with his ""kill"" on a Canadian CF-35. ""—just got inside his turn radius, and boom! Guns guns guns!""

""That was you, wasn't it?"" Frost asked.

""Guilty.""

""You give him that kill?""

Belle took a sip of her beer. ""I flew by the rules of the exercise. He got a valid guns track. Good kill.""

Frost studied her flight lead. ""You're scary when you're planning something.""

""I'm not planning anything,"" Belle said. ""I'm just observing.""

A group of F-22 pilots swagger past, one of them nodding respectfully at Belle. ""Good fight today, Major. You almost had Stevens sweating.""

""Almost only counts in horseshoes,"" Belle replied, echoing Tate.

The Raptor pilot laughed. ""And hand grenades. See you up there tomorrow. Try to last longer than ten minutes this time.""

After he walked away, Frost muttered, ""Assholes.""

""No,"" Belle said quietly. ""They're the apex predators. They know it, we know it, everyone knows it."" She finished her beer. ""Tonight.""

\*\*\*

The next morning's briefing started like the first. General Thorne was in fine form, outlining the day's exercise scenarios. The Canadians would fly two more defensive evolutions, standard parameters.

Then General Tate stood up.

""General Thorne, a request.""

The room went quiet. Thorne looked surprised but gestured for him to continue.

""My pilots performed well yesterday, but within limited parameters. We'd like to request a full force integration exercise. All of Red Flag versus our six aircraft.""

The silence stretched for three full seconds before someone laughed. Then another. Soon half the room was chuckling.

Thorne held up a hand for quiet, though he was smiling himself. ""Pat, that's... ambitious. We're talking about over two hundred aircraft.""

""I'm aware of the numbers.""

""Your six against everyone?"" Thorne wanted to be clear. ""No restrictions, full battlespace?""

""Correct. We'd like to demonstrate our full capability integration.""

Belle watched Thorne's face. She could see him thinking—the Canadians had lost 42-6 yesterday in limited engagements. What would happen in an unrestricted furball would be a massacre. It would be embarrassing. It would be...

""You know what? Sure."" Thorne's grin was magnanimous. ""You want the full Red Flag experience? You got it. Might be the shortest exercise on record, but hell, we're all friends here."" He turned to the room. ""Gentlemen, looks like this afternoon is going to be a turkey shoot. Try to leave enough of our Canadian friends intact for them to fly home.""

More laughter. Belle caught Tate's eye. He gave her the slightest nod.

After the briefing, in the Canadian ready room, Tate's orders were simple.

""Major Deschamps. Full Mosaic integration. All restrictions lifted."" He paused. ""Show them the future.""

Belle felt her heart rate spike. ""Rules of engagement?""

""There are no rules in the future, Major. Only outcomes.""

\*\*\*

Belle sat in her CF-35 on the Nellis runway, watching the massive coordinated launch of Blue Force. The first wave—forty F-35s and F-16s—was already airborne and forming up. Behind them, the second wave was taxiing: F-15s, F-22s, allied aircraft. Eighty aircraft would be in the first engagement, with the rest launching in continuous waves. It was a maximum effort surge, the kind of coordinated assault that only the United States could orchestrate.

""Goose Flight, Goose One,"" she called to her five wingmen. ""Standard takeoff, standard climb. Mosaic integration on my mark.""

They launched in two groups of three, climbing slowly toward the exercise area. Belle could see the first wave on her helmet display—eighty blue triangles converging on her six red ones, with more launching every minute. The radio chatter from Blue Force was confident, almost casual.

""Raptor One, first wave is in position. Second wave launching now.""

""Viper Lead, we'll sweep south, box them in.""

""Eagle Flight, establishing CAP at angels thirty. Let's make this quick. I've got a tee time at four.""

Belle took a breath. Released it. And flipped the switch.

""Good afternoon, Major Deschamps,"" the Mosaic said in her helmet, calm as a weather report. ""Oh my. Eighty aircraft in the air and—goodness—another sixty preparing to launch? Should I handle this for you?""

""Light them up,"" Belle whispered.

The change was instantaneous. Her helmet display exploded with information—not just positions, but pilot names, fuel states, weapon loads, even stress indicators based on breathing patterns captured through their radio transmissions. She could see everything—airborne and on the ground.

""Deploying the Honkers,"" Mosaic mentioned conversationally. ""The Americans are about to have some electronic difficulties. Sorry, boys.""

Forty Honker drones, which had been flying in actual goose formation at 3,000 feet, suddenly scattered. Each one became a digital nightmare, flooding radar screens with false returns, jamming datalinks, creating ghost aircraft that looked absolutely real to every sensor.

""Blue Force, we've got... wait, what the hell?""

""My radar's showing—Jesus Christ, there's three hundred contacts!""

""Negative, negative, I'm showing five hundred—""

""Data link is down! I've lost the link!""

""Wave two, abort launch! Abort launch! Something's wrong with—""

The voice communications dissolved into static. Then, horrifyingly, they came back—but wrong. Blue Force pilots heard their own voices giving different orders, calling different targets.

Belle watched through her now-omniscient display as chaos spread through the Blue formation. The eighty airborne aircraft were turning on each other. On the ground, the second wave was getting conflicting orders—some trying to launch, others trying to abort.

""Oh dear,"" Mosaic said. ""The ones on the ground are having navigation troubles. Half of them think the runway has shifted forty degrees. Should I make it worse?""

""Execute,"" Belle commanded.

The six Canadian CF-35s hadn't fired a single weapon. They didn't need to. Belle watched as Mosaic fed false data to the airborne Raptor flight, showing Canadian fighters where they weren't. The F-22s, supremely confident in their sensors, maneuvered to engage and flew directly into simulated missile envelopes from Belle's flight.

""SIMULATED KILL, RAPTOR ONE, RETURN TO BASE."" ""SIMULATED KILL, RAPTOR TWO, RETURN TO BASE."" ""SIMULATED KILL, RAPTOR THREE, RETURN TO BASE.""

""How the fuck—"" someone's panic broke through the static.

""Tower, we've got aircraft refusing to start on the ground!""

""Negative, tower, runway incursion! There's a—no wait, there's nothing there!""

Belle and her flight flew in calm racetrack patterns, not even maneuvering aggressively. They didn't need to. They were conductors of a digital orchestra, and every American aircraft—airborne or grounded—was playing their song.

Eight minutes in, all eighty airborne Blue Force aircraft were ""dead.""

Ten minutes in, the ground-alert aircraft that had managed to launch were eliminated.

At twelve minutes, Mosaic spoke apologetically: ""Major, I'm afraid the remaining aircraft are still on the ground, unable to launch due to various... complications. Should I count them as mission kills?""

""That's sufficient.""

""EXERCISE TERMINATED. BLUE FORCE: 217 LOSSES (80 AIRBORNE, 137 GROUND ABORT). RED FORCE: 0 LOSSES. TIME: TWELVE MINUTES, FOURTEEN SECONDS.""

Belle brought her CF-35 around in a gentle turn, her five wingmen sliding into parade formation beside her. They flew over Nellis like that—six aircraft in perfect alignment, unhurried, untouched.

""Shall I restore their systems?"" Mosaic asked.

""Give them another minute,"" Belle said. ""Let them think about it.""

\*\*\*

The main observation room at Nellis was designed to handle chaos. It had witnessed a thousand exercise debriefs, arguments, lessons learned. It had never witnessed silence like this.

The main screen still showed the final tally: BLUE FORCE: 217 LOSSES. RED FORCE: 0 LOSSES.

General Rex Thorne stood frozen, his face the color of Nevada limestone. Around him, senior officers from a dozen nations stared at the screen with expressions ranging from confusion to naked fear.

""Run it again,"" Thorne said quietly.

The replay started. Eighty aircraft converging on six. Then... chaos. Electronic warfare on a scale that shouldn't be possible. Fratricide. Confusion. Systematic annihilation. And on the ground, aircraft unable to launch, systems failing, navigation computers showing runways that didn't exist.

""What..."" Thorne's voice cracked. He cleared his throat, tried again. ""What is that?""

General Patrick Tate stood at the back of the room, hands clasped behind him. ""That, General, is the new global standard for aerospace security.""

""That's not possible,"" someone said. ""The processing power alone—""

""The integration requirements—""

""How did they spoof the IFF?""

""Gentlemen,"" Tate said, cutting through the chatter. ""The technical details will be made available to your governments as part of the Ottawa Doctrine briefing package. You'll receive it early next week.""

""The Ottawa Doctrine?"" Thorne turned to face him.

""A new framework for global stability. The Prime Minister will be announcing it formally at the United Nations."" Tate's voice was calm, almost gentle. ""The age of conventional air superiority is over. Canada is prepared to ensure peaceful skies for all nations that participate in the program.""

""And if we don't participate?"" The question came from the British Typhoon squadron commander.

Tate smiled—a polite, Canadian smile that somehow made the room feel colder.

""Well, that would be unfortunate. But I'm sure it won't come to that. We're all friends here, after all.""

Through the observation windows, the six CF-35s were landing in precise sequence. Belle's aircraft was the last to touch down.

Thorne watched her taxi past the tower. His empire—America's eight-decade reign as the undisputed master of the skies—had just ended in twelve minutes and fourteen seconds.

""Pat,"" he said quietly. ""We gave you everything. The F-35 codes. The architecture. *Everything*.""

""Yes,"" Tate agreed. ""That was very generous. The softwood lumber agreement was particularly appreciated.""

The insult landed like a slap. Thorne's hands clenched into fists.

""Though I should mention,"" Tate continued, ""we've made some improvements. I think you'll be impressed when you see the full documentation.""

He turned to leave, then paused at the door.

""Oh, General Thorne? Excellent exercise. Very realistic. Your pilots performed exactly as expected.""

The door closed with a soft click.

In the silence that followed, someone whispered, ""What do we tell Washington?""

Thorne was still staring at the scoreboard. 217-0.

""Tell them,"" he said slowly, ""that we need to read that doctrine very, very carefully.""

Outside, the Nevada sun was setting, painting the desert in shades of red and gold. On the Canadian ramp, Belle climbed down from her CF-35 to find her ground crew waiting.

""How'd it go, Major?"" her crew chief asked, though his grin said he already knew.

Belle pulled off her helmet, ran a hand through her sweat-damp hair, and looked back toward the main tower where she knew the American brass were still trying to process what had happened.

""It went exactly as expected,"" she said. ""Prepare the aircraft for tomorrow. I have a feeling they'll want a rematch.""

""Think they'll do better?""

Belle started walking toward the debriefing room. ""No. But they'll try. Americans always do.""

The crew chief watched her go, then turned to his team. ""You heard the Major. Full service on all six aircraft.""

""Just six aircraft,"" one of the junior technicians said, shaking his head. ""Against everyone.""

""That's all we needed,"" the crew chief replied. ""That's all we'll ever need.""

As the sun dipped below the mountains, the Honker drones returned to their hidden landing sites scattered across the Nevada desert, looking for all the world like regular Canada Geese settling in for the night.

**What this post is**

I am sharing a longform article I have been writing for six to seven months. I map how money, companies, and authorities combine to create what I call a cultivated oversight gap. This is what I would like to imagine as an accountability project, and I'd like to be explicit- my aim is to surface and scrutinize the role of Veritas Capital and Brown Brothers Harriman in building and maintaining that gap for government-adjacent work. The full piece is far too long for Reddit, so below is a plain summary with a high level view of the findings. Full citations and detail are here:

https://burningrob.substack.com/p/sub-rosa-organized-secrecy

**Why I wrote it**

I kept seeing a lot of big claims with very thin sourcing and, at the same time, plenty of strong evidence that was not being connected clearly. My goal is to separate what is documented from what is not, show people the pipes that money and contracts run through, and invite the community to pressure test the argument. I had to learn a great deal in order to write this, and am, like all humans, still learning more every day. This project was an expression of that desire to know more about the world around us. 

**What I actually claim**

My central claim is that we are dealing with a repeatable architecture that is carefully insulated from public oversight. It relies on concentrated private ownership of key contractors, private bank custodianship that operates outside normal audit trails, and serial rollups and rebrands that move people, contracts, and intellectual property while lowering visibility. Public money can commingle with private capital inside this structure, which preserves deniability and continuity behind cut outs and proprietaries. In this article I treat Veritas Capital and Brown Brothers Harriman as a live case, and likely a central component of the Legacy Program. Veritas functions as a control node across a defense and intelligence portfolio, and Brown Brothers Harriman functions as the circulatory system that keeps the money opaque. Together they illustrate how a cultivated oversight gap can and has been engineered and maintained.

I also lay out an allegation about Kona Blue. I argue that the attempted transfer did not simply die on interagency objections, and I present dates and transactions that suggest Veritas-linked entities and Brown Brothers Harriman custody could have provided the private side rails for continuity. I trace a plausible path for sensitive materials and work product from the Lockheed Enterprise Integration Group, through The SI Organization, to Vencore, to Perspecta, to Peraton, with related spinoffs such as Arcfield. I am not claiming that every hop is proven to carry the same physical materials. I am claiming that the custody and corporate control needed to shelter Kona Blue-related holdings existed at the right moments, and that this private architecture is exactly what you would use if you wanted continuity without attention.

**Method and sources**

I use corporate filings, merger documents, contractor lineages, investor materials, historical records, and open reporting. I match those against interviews and researcher leads, some of which I personally took part in over the last two years. Where a claim relies on a non-traditional or not fully vetted source, I say so. Where a claim rests on documents, I say that too. If I fail to do so, please inform me and I will correct it.

**How to read this post**

Skim the summaries to find the parts of the article you may care about. If you want to go deeper, the link has the long version with references. I will try my best to be in the thread to answer questions and make corrections if you show me better sources.

***

**1) Skull and Ledger**

I begin with a short primer on how we got here. The pattern is older than any single program. World War II and early Cold War practice created the template: elite private banks handling custody and foreign exchange for government-linked activity, industrial houses providing deniable platforms, and proprietaries that blended commercial form with covert function. Non-official cover rode airlines, trading firms, and engineering shops. Postwar special projects like Big Safari normalized rapid contracting, out-of-cycle funding, and contractor-led sustainment for highly sensitive capabilities. The point is not nostalgia. It is lineage. The same levers exist today in updated wrappers. If you understand how banks, cut outs, and privileged contracting used to work, you will recognize the modern architecture when you see it.

**2) A Mask, Not a Face**

Here I profile Veritas Capital as the owner layer that makes continuity possible without constant attention. Veritas focuses on companies serving the military, intelligence community, and government technology. Its portfolio has included or includes Peraton, Guidehouse, Cubic, Alion Science, and DynCorp International. Leadership benches and advisory boards draw heavily from former generals, admirals, CIA officers, and Pentagon officials, which gives the firm unusual access inside the system it invests in. The public profile is intentionally small. Veritas rarely issues press releases, its CEO rarely gives interviews, and the firm often uses acquisition vehicles that keep attention on operating brands rather than the owner. That is the mask. The brand is the face.

**3) Face Down, Deal Again**

This is the corporate lineage walkthrough and the method it demonstrates. The path is familiar to readers here: Lockheed’s Enterprise Integration Group to The SI Organization to Vencore to Perspecta to Peraton, with related spinoffs such as Arcfield. The important details are procedural. Contract novations under FAR 42.12 keep performance continuous even as the counterparty name changes. CAGE codes, DD254s, and facility clearances can be transitioned so that classified work does not pause. Transition service agreements move data, tooling, and personnel under controlled schedules. Each hop provides a fresh wrapper, a reset of disclosure baselines, and a new place to park sensitive artifacts. I argue this is financial cloaking at scale. If you wanted continuity without attention, you would do it exactly this way.

**4) Kona Blue**

Readers here know the basics, so I will be direct. The attempt in 2010 to formalize Kona Blue reached the PSAP stage, meaning a proposed special access program that had a sponsor, a draft security concept, and a path to a cognizant authority, but lacked final establishment and code assignment. In practice, PSAP status allows limited planning activity under draft compartments and prospective access rosters while the SAP approval chain works or stalls.

My claim is twofold. First, the interagency pushback did not simply kill the effort in a clean way. Second, the private architecture existed to preserve continuity without a fully established SAP. I lay out how custody and work product could ride private side rails while PSAP approval languished. The path is one many may not be aware of: Lockheed’s Enterprise Integration Group to The SI Organization to Vencore to Perspecta to Peraton, with related spinoffs like Arcfield. Each hop provides a fresh wrapper, a new set of transition service agreements, and a place to park personnel, contracts, and artifacts while reducing surface area.

I am not asking you to accept that every item labeled Kona Blue moved intact across each step. I am asking you to look at the timing and the control points. A PSAP that is not greenlit still generates planning artifacts, draft MOUs, and prospective access rosters. Those do not evaporate. In a portfolio controlled by Veritas Capital and custodied by Brown Brothers Harriman, there is a ready-made route to keep sensitive holdings alive inside contractor networks, outside ordinary audit trails, until conditions change. That is the mechanism.

**5) Gatekeeper, Keymaster**

Now I go into the financial plumbing that makes the above viable. A global custodian bank holds fund assets, runs foreign exchange, maintains cash accounts, and services capital calls and distributions. Subscription credit lines extend short-term leverage against uncalled LP commitments, which smooths capital timing and obscures cash-flow footprints. Limited partnership agreements and side letters set confidentiality, valuation policies, and reporting cadence. Inside that stack, public dollars can commingle with private capital and still remain outside ordinary public records. In the article I profile Brown Brothers Harriman in this role for Veritas funds. My claim is direct. The bank rails are the gatekeeper. The portfolio manager is the keymaster. Together they define who can see what, when, and at what level of aggregation.

**6) By their returns you shall know them**

Here I explain who likely supplies the money and why governance, is the thing to look at. A meaningful portion of this funding can come from ordinary Americans through public employee pension plans and fund-of-funds inside 401(k) menus, alongside family offices and mission-adjacent capital. Investment committees sign limited partnership agreements and side letters that lock in confidentiality. Beneficiaries rarely see the exposure, and public records requests generally stop at the private-fund boundary. Custodians and general partners decide flows, valuation marks, and reporting windows. The result is an outsourced black box whose success is scored by return profiles, not by disclosure or democratic consent. When a brand becomes radioactive, the assets and people can migrate into a new wrapper and the machine keeps running while teachers, firefighters, nurses, and city workers remain financially tied to the outcome.

**7) Closed eyes, dark hearts, cannot lose**

Here I stress test the model against hard cases. When a contractor or portfolio brand becomes politically toxic, capabilities often survive through rebrand, spinout, or roll up. The legal devices are straightforward. Asset purchase agreements that carve out troubled liabilities. Successor entities that assume performance under novated contracts. Transitional use of legacy systems under service agreements while new entities stand up. Watch for continuity signals that outlast a scandal. Same key personnel in cleared billets. Same contract numbers and task orders under a new legal name. Same SCIF addresses and secure networks with freshly issued letterhead. My point is not to relitigate every scandal. My point is to show how the machine is designed to preserve the work even when labels fail.

**8) As above, so below**

I break down how an alleged umbrella program could be distributed across the existing contractor ecosystem. Sensor collection lives on air, space, and terrestrial platforms with program offices that already rely heavily on contractor-led integration. Analysis lives inside FedRAMP HIGH accredited cloud environments, cross-domain solutions, and data-fusion stacks that contractors already build and operate. Exploitation lives in compartmented labs with vendor-managed sustainment, all held together by Memoranda of understanding, service level agreements, and need-to-know rosters that are coordinated across agencies but executed by companies. In that world, a PSAP-level effort can persist in pieces while a formal establishment code never arrives. The practical effect is continuity without any visible center of gravity.

**9) The shape in the fog**

This is a conclusion section. Does this even merit an explanation? 

***

**What I am asking from this community**

Point me to records that confirm or break chains described above. I am looking for SEC exhibits that name Brown Brothers Harriman as custodian for other funds, merger schedules and transition services agreements in the EIG to SI to Vencore to Perspecta to Peraton path, novation documents that show how contracts moved, HSR filings, and custodian or FX agreements that clarify who held what and when. If you work in procurement, fund administration, or bank custody and see an error, tell me and cite it. If you have a better model that explains the same facts, lay it out and I will engage.

**About me**

I am Rob, a former U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion engineer (machinist’s mate). I have not worked in that field for quite a while. I have done everything from radio to making pizza. For most of my life I was convinced UFOs and aliens were not real. I got pulled into this around the time of David Grusch’s testimony, and the last two years have been a whirlwind that started right here. Friends I made in this subreddit, after chatting with posters whose work I admired, became real-life friends and helped me get personally involved in disclosure. I even ended up at the most recent hearings, but that is a story for another day. Thanks for reading. I appreciate your time, and if you choose to support my work there are options to do so but this is by no means a call for that.

Last year I blew through my student loan way too fast and ended up leaning on my overdraft way more than I’d like to admit 😅.

This time around I’ve started tracking things more seriously, Monzo pots for nights out, a food shop budget, and even trying to cook more instead of defaulting to Deliveroo. I came across this student budgeting guide the other day ([link here if anyone’s curious](https://moneymending.com/the-ultimate-student-budgeting-guide-uk-2025-how-to-survive-and-thrive-at-university/)) and it made me realise how much I underestimate “little” spends like coffees, snacks, or train tickets home.

I guess my question is: how do you actually make it stick? Do you give yourself a strict weekly allowance in cash, keep everything on a card/app, or just accept that overspending is inevitable and make peace with the overdraft?

The pot is empty. She tracks down Neelix, who tells her:

***“No, but we have something even better.”*** \[ST:VOY S1 E6\]

🎥 YouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY\_UHm8rvmY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY_UHm8rvmY)

Neelix is the voice of discipline: forgo motivation and install a new habit. Build structure, ignore short-term cravings, and stay steady for the long haul.

That’s one way to fight procrastination and burnout: the discipline path. You don’t rely on feeling excited. You rely on habit. Even if you’re not in the mood to code, apply, or practice, you do it anyway because the structure demands it.

💡**Discipline**: You form good work habits to keep you moving. Instead of waiting to feel motivated, self-discipline forces you to act whether you want to or not. If you feel like procrastinating, your habits keep you going. If you feel like burning out, your routines won’t let you stop. The key is simple: make yourself do the right thing, even if you don’t feel like it.

But Janeway cuts him off, testy and clear: ***""I don't want something even better. I want coffee.""***

Janeway is the voice of motivation: keep yourself fueled by always having something exciting to chase. Curate motivations, follow short-term cravings, and let those bursts of energy carry you through the long haul.

💡**Motivation**: You get pumped up and stay excited about what you’re doing so you jump in right away instead of procrastinating. If you start slacking off, you reignite the spark. If you are burning out, you “turn that frown upside down” and redouble your efforts. The key is to always be motivated.

👉 Both approaches can work:

* Discipline keeps you consistent when you’d rather quit.
* Motivation fuels you with excitement so it doesn’t feel like work.

The key is knowing which one you need. Some thrive on discipline. Others burn brightest when they’re motivated all the time. Most need a mix of both.

🔑 So the next time you catch yourself procrastinating or burning out, ask: ""Am I missing a coffee substitute, or am I missing coffee?""

Later, on the bridge, Chakotay points out a nebula. Tuvok explains it’s rich in omicron particles. Janeway smiles and gives the order:

I tried absolutely everything, including all the standard microbiome rebalancing, and nothing made a hint of different. My GI doctor tested my fecal elastase, etc. and prescribed me Colestipol, a bile acid sequestrant, a month ago. And it WORKED. I finally have normal bowel movements again. It's great.

My question for you fine folks is; what would the relationship be between a medication like this, and the gut biome? I would imagine that my bowel movements suddenly being more regular would have some kind of effect on my biome, maybe even a negative one at first. Since starting the medication, I've been in a pretty nasty crash, though there's no telling if it's because of the medication or it's just another wave of random illness. Colestipol is not known for having side effects, especially not side effects that are unrelated to the GI tract, like what I'm experiencing. My symptoms are:

\- Fatigue

\- Peripheral neuropathy, especially after drinking coffee

\- Transient headaches and aural fullness

I stopped the medication for a week and surprisingly, my stools stayed normal, but it did not bring me out of my crash.

# The Atmosphere

It is Thailand's 2nd largest city but it is far less hectic than Bangkok. To the west it’s rainforest as far as the Burmese border. Nimman, where I was, is trendy, wealthier, but not hectic or dead.

There are cafes, boutiques, coworking spaces, and night markets all clustered in one small neighborhood.

It is even possible to not use any transport rent a scooter if you stick to Nimman like I did but that is something more for a nomad worker as opposed to a tourist.

Planes do actually fly very low over the city as the airport is very close to Nimman, so there is noise from that frequently. It is noticeable and something to bear in mind but not a massive deal breaker unless you have health or mental conditions affected by this.

# Food & Drink

* Regional specialties: Regional specialty is Khao Soi noodle soup that’s what you’ll find all over. Personal favourites for it Kao Soy Nimman (Michelin-starred) and Pa Kiang Noodles Shop.
* One nimman One market street food: There is a food court inside One Nimman Plaza on the ground floor with ramen, Japanese curry, Hainanese chicken rice (Michelin-starred stall), pad thai, Peking duck rice, sweets like kanom krok, coconut ice cream, and longan juice all below £3.
* Cafes and coworking: Yellow Coworking, Pai Yan Coffee, FOHHIDE, and Charlie Thai Tea (best Thai tea I’ve ever had it’s £2 a drink and it is something straight out of a high end cocktail bar). Craft coffee in Thailand is excellent and there is a growing culture of locally sources coffee, chocolate tea etc.
* Maya Mall: Has restaurants in the price range of £5-10 per meal, although there is a more affordable street food style hall down below with numerous dessert stalls (bubble tea, Thai coconut sweets).
* Overall Variety: Thai focused on Northenr Thai > Japanese >Chinese hotpot > Vietnamese > Korean (BBQ included) > Western (pizzas, burgers, Italian) > Burmese> South Indian (including veg) > Other (Middle Eastern etc)

Both the quantity and quality of Japanese food in Chiang Mai especially curry rice, ramen, yakitori bars, Takoyaki, okonomiyaki, izayaka and sweets with matcha is phenomenal.

* Nightlife & drinking: There are crowded bars with students and locals, mainly weekends. As a nomad though I didn’t go.

# Gyms & Fitness

Besides Muay Thai weight lifting and cardio style gyms are more expensive in SE Asia with few costing less than £50 and commonly up to £100.

* Golden Hillside Gym: The exception at £25/month. It has retro Nautilus machines (90s feeling) they are worn but all work. It gives a cool 'Arnold Golds gym' vibe but it was perfect value for money if you are more of a lifting person. It has 5 or so treadmills 4 or so bikes and does offer classes with a wood floor mirror studio and small kettle bell fake grass area
* Very difficult to find protein powder outside of gyms. Ordering online will cost you £40 to £50 slightly cheaper inside gyms but not by much. Even in Maya mall which is upsacle I struggled to find it.
* There are only a couple of ‘healthy’ marketed low cal or high protein or vegan restaurants in Nimman but a lot of Thai food especially noodle soup dishes are already relatively healthy.
* Maya Mall Gym: Didn’t go but is around £100 per month.

# Accommodation

* Golden Hillside Condo: Low cost, with the gym and pool (pool cannot be used without monthly occupancy). Noisy during day while refurbishment is in progress from 11 am to 4pm when I was there. Rooms are ok not super nice.
* Vienping Condo: Near Maya Mall. My room was renovated room so it was nicer but it is hard for me to tell what other airbnb in there would be like.

Laundry is convenient and affordable I got 7kg washed, ironed, picked up and delivered for £12 at Foo Foo Laundry.

# Getting Around

* Your go-to taxi and bike taxi is Grab app. The ride fee is typically £2-3 from Nimman to the old city city centre in a decent air conditioned aar. Food delivery charges are £2 or under if you select the longer wait time option. Giving you room to tip.
* The area around yellow coworking space is a grid it is walkable but you need to pay attention since it is a 2 way road with thin to no pavements. The main rods almost always have pavements further away from the traffic. Working and eating there as a Nomad with my accommodation under 10 mins walk away was the main reason I never needed transport for a whole month. Other than to the airport or my day out at the Buhddist temple.

# Weather & Cleanliness

Weather is in 3-5 day cycles: Clear Pixar movie sunshine/blue skies at 30°C, cloudy with light rain, and storms. Even with storms, Nimman is pretty clean (just modest dirt and vegetation on the road next to the kerb and drains. In terms of man made rubbish it is very clean.

On the clear sunny days if you have a balcony view towards the mountain behind Maya mall it look stunning. The contrast between the green forrest covered mountain and blue sky.

# Culture & Sightseeing

I went to Wat Chediluang Varaviharn: Temple of over 600 years old.

Note: females are not allowed inside the city pillar shrine as one of the Buddhist traditions.

It has a 600 year old original temple then a newer payer hall with a huge golden Buddha. it gives you access to the manuscript and Buddhist museum which is a small building inside the compound.

Unfortunately though the manuscripts were kept upstairs and that area was closed off and it looks like it was permanent.

National Museum, Chiang Mai: Mostly Buddhist relics and some neolithic ones but the English translations are poor.

I didn’t go but there is Doi Pui Mountain: Trekking, shrines, and cable car in the vicinity.

Seen lots of adverts for the Safari and zoo but didn’t go.

Nimman one nimman night market has live music and craft and fashion stalls and delicious BBQ skewers.

# Safety and convenience

* Nimman and Chiang Mai is very safe. There is an English-language tourist police hotline as well
* City roads are most lit, but there are some deeper residential that branch off the main road are not well lit.
* It's a very low crime rate place didn't see anything that even looked like a scam. None of the massage places look sketchy ,
* Roughly 80% of restaurants are cash only even in Nimman. ATMs are \~£5 each withdrawal on Mastercard.
* Bars in Nimman are mostly frequented by locals at least there isn't really a of 2 groups of 6 drunk Brit and Aussie fighting in the street.

# Budget Snapshot (monthly)

* Airbnb: £300-350
* Food & groceries: £300 if you make breakfast at home but £400+ if eating out 3 meals per day every day plus drinks/desserts
* eSIM: £15-20
* Activities: £150
* Coworking space: £40 at yellow but can vary a bit
* Lifts: £2-3 each ride

# Practical Bits

* Arrival: You need to transfer airports in Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi to Don Mueang) then Don Mueang to Chiang Mai. You get a complimentary 40 min transfer by shuttle bus for Suvarnabhumi to Don Mueang if you present your flight ticket.
* Internet: Both 5G and WiFi are excellent throughout from Airbnb, coworking and the esmi
* Grocery shopping: Maya Mall is no cheaper than home (Europe) in price - Crocs are £75 Rimping Supermarket mall is reasonable for Western food.
* When you land you MUST buy thai green balm and mosquito repellent spray it on all of your exposed limbs. I learned the hard way.
* The locals have limited English. With the best Engilsh being in the 18-25 age group so it is ideal to learn a few Thai phrases for thank you, hello/goodbye etc.

# Community & Crowd

* Lots of Korean and Chinese tourists and some locals. But not crowded and over touristified and not dead. Everyone seemed well behaved though.
* CAMP coworking library (Maya Mall) was mostly locals. There was more expats at Yellow Coworking if you are into networking as a English speaker.

# Regrets & Lessons

* It wasn't worth daily excursions for Western breakfasts. Could have made eggs, bacon, and toast at home for so much less.
* Length of stay: 5-7 days is enough time for an overview for the average tourist. One month is ideal if you work remotely.

# TL;DR

It is relaxed, affordable, safe, and a foodie heaven , if you are in Nimman. Perfect for slow travelers and remote nomads, but if you are just a tourist traveler, 5-7 days will suffice due to lack of activities which are mainly Buddhist temples, the nearby nature and hikes and zoo/safari.",1,1758387367.0,digitalnomadFIRE,0,1.0,False

I have had migraines for 10 years and lately I just have little energy.  In the afternoon I find myself wanting to take a nap and barely getting by.  Focusing is very tough at work.  I kept telling myself it was burnout as I've been doing the same job for 15 years, but with this bloodwork I realize other things may be going on.  So looking to make some positive changes.  **I am seeing two doctors right now**, a MD general family doctor and then an MD natural path doctor.  MD says just watch out for cholesterol and heart health.  Natural path doctor wants me to go on a bunch of meds and gave lots of suggestions.  So looking here for any advice/path forward.  **Clearly, will not take any advice here as medical advice.**  Just looking for anything I can research more and add in to see if it helps.  Thanks!

Main things of concern:  
Iron:  
2025 bloodwork - 210  
2024 bloodwork - 88  
My diet hasn't changed that much.  I'm going to lower my meat intake and start doing more salmon to see if this helps.  

Thyroid:  
TSH  
2025 - 5.31  
2024 - 3.94  
I did a full thyroid panel 3/31/25 and it was at 4.35 then.  So its slowly increasing; 3.94 to 4.35 and now 5.31.  I've been to 3 doctors for my thyroid, one said it was perfectly fine.  2nd doctor said it was sluggish.  3rd doctor said I needed to go on Armour Thyroid meds.  So I'm a little lost.  

Plan: going to work out more, eat brazil nuts for selenium, destress more, and ensure I get tons of sleep.  Which I do sleep pretty well now.  

I added my thyroid bloodwork in the last image.  If it doesn't get better I may go on meds to see if it helps.  But would prefer to try it naturally just to see if its a diet issue or something else I can change without going on lifelong meds.  

ApoB  
2025 - 111  
This shows as very high.  Didn't get it tested in 2024.    
Going to cut out all dairy, cheese, etc.  Going to add fish oil to my supplements.  Adding more vegetables and do less red meat.  Adding lots more fiber via Chia Seeds, Flax Seeds and Inulin powder.  

OxLDL  
2025 - 74  
Follow same guidelines as Apob.  Eat healthier.  

About me:  
Age - 40  
Sex - Male  
Weight - 170 lbs  
Somewhat active lifestyle.  Walk a lot, I'm at a desk 4/5 hours a day but walking around quite often too for work.  I don't work out as much from an injury so need to pick that back up slowly, just waiting for an injury to get better, so keeping to walking at the moment.    
  
Diet: consist mostly of whole foods but of course I cheat and eat some ice cream once in awhile and drink a soda.  Cutting all that out prior to my next blood test.  

Diet: cook everything with EVOO  
Breakfast: two eggs, quinoa, arugula and then a fruit smoothie with flax, chia seeds.  Then a coffee with milk.    
Lunch/Dinner - meat and vegetable.  It is red meat heavy though.  So I need to fix that and replace red meats with more salmon and possibly even a dish without any meat.    
I am gluten free.    
Grain free, except quinoa.

He ended up getting a job off the books and makes a lot more money than I do. The reason why he works off the books is because he has a felony on his record and it is very hard for him to get a job. I work for a life insurance company as a secretary and I only make 14.30 an hour.  So after we ran up my credit cards, he promised to help me pay them down, so that was fine. So last week he asked me ""what bills have to be paid?"". I told him I needed $137 to pay a certain credit card, I told his this 3 times that week.  Come Friday, he throws a fit and swears up and down I didn't tell him.  So in the end, I have to wait till I get paid to pay it, I get paid every 2 weeks,he gets paid every week.  I make $934.80 every 2 weeks, he gets like 600 a week.  Now I just purchased 2 TVs and 2 chase lounges.  One TV was going downstairs where he sleeps, I sleep upstairs because my bed upstairs is better for my arthritis in my back.  I asked him numerous times before I financed this, that he is going to help me with the payments, he swears up and down he will, well last night, he threw a curve ball at me, that he is taking a trip to Florida to see his family and he needs to save every dollar he has.  I said well what about our bills and he immediately flipped out on me.  This morning we went to get coffee and he started with me again, I was right by my gym so because he was driving like an animal, I got out of the car.  Now let me just say that he is in recovery from meth and he used to get mad paranoid, he immediately texted me and said I was having sex with someone else, I literally sent a picture of me at the gym but he kept going.  He said he is not helping me anymore so I told him that I am returning the TV and the chair cause I can't afford everything, so when I got home, he went out and I went downstairs and packed up the TV in his room.  He gets very angry very quickly, so sometimes I get horrible anxiety when we fight, I completely shut down.  We split the rent, I pay $635 every 2 weeks for my half.  Now I am not upset about him going to Florida to see his family, I am upset that he promised me that he was going to help me with these bills, we both racked up and now he makes his own plans and just it feels like a slap in the face to me.

My wife and I were in Paris this week. We were visiting from Chicago. 
After we visited Sainte-Chapelle we went across the street to grab a couple of coffees. There is a little souvenir shop right there between the two cafes. See attached picture for reference. 

There is a stand just outside the shop on the right hand side. It has bike license plates. We saw one with our daughter’s name on it, but we decided to buy our coffees and come back for it. When we went back 15 minutes later it was gone! 😩 The shop clerk came out and looked with us and checked the back but he didn’t have any more. Foolishly we assumed we were looking at a stack of them. 

See picture of similar one for reference.
We never found any similar ones anywhere else. It is yellow, blue with Eiffel Tower and black lettering 

Our daughter’s name is MADELEINE with three E’s. It’s spell the French way. We can never find it spelled that way in America. 

What I’m hoping/asking for is, if someone stops by that shop, could they check and see if they have one. 
I will be glad to reimburse you for the purchase and shipping it to me. They only cost around 5 Euro. 

If you get one, please DM me and I will provide a shipping address.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, just started living together for a few months, and I have offered to help pick up his son from school and drop him off, and also watch him until he comes home from work. I told him I was comfortable doing these things for now, and maybe in the future I would feel comfortable taking him to his practices or other events. Today is his first soccer game, and we're all excited, but I found out Thursday night that BM and a good portion of her family will be there. BM has made it obvious in the past that she doesn't want to see me. For example, last year, his son had a Christmas program I was nervous about attending. BM was there with some family, and when it was time to meet, she hid in the restroom. Her stepmother tried to get her to leave the restroom, but she refused. This year, he had a birthday party that my boyfriend was invited to. He asked if I could go as well, and she said yes. I told him I was uncomfortable since this would be our first time meeting, and he said it would be fine. I offered to maybe get coffee with her and her boyfriend as a couple, and just get to know each other before I attend these big events. He agreed and told her this, but she never got back to us after mentioning it. Long story short, she didn't introduce herself to me and kinda dodged me at the party until her grandma introduced us. Basically, I don't have a relationship with BM.

So now, today, I asked my boyfriend if we had to sit next to her and the family, or if we could have our own spot since it's just us and close enough to where his son isn't running far to see us. My boyfriend said it was fine, but he thinks we should sit closer for the reason I just mentioned. I told him that if we do, I know that you are going to be talking to them the whole time and just kinda leave me there alone. He did this at the birthday party, but it wasn't terrible because his family was there, and I had someone I knew and felt comfortable with. I told my boyfriend I want to support his son at the game, but I just feel weird going since I barely know the other side of the family. He then said I was entitled to go, that I help out with his son, and that even BM appreciates the effort I do (because she volunteered me on PTA stuff when I didn't even agree to it). I told him okay... but why doesn't she talk to me? I don't know, to me it's confusing, and maybe I am just overreacting because I hate confrontation. Could I have some advice on how to handle this?

I sit on a cheap plastic chair -     
the kind that makes a sound when you move -      
next to a girl wrapped in a sweater      
though the sun is sweating at thirty degrees.      
     
Her eyes are milked of light,     
as if someone shelled them to stop the night
from walking in.       
They gave her this - this soft sedation -     
to keep the spirits behind her eyes,      
to keep the horrors from stepping forward.      
      
My daughter leans like a hinge,      
small against the world.       
She smiles at me the way houses smile when rain begins -      
not quite open, only remembering how.       
      
Across the yard a man with tattoos like violent prayers       
cradles a glittery stress ball,       
pressing sequins into his palms as if the sparkles could stitch his skin.      
He lies on a bench and lets the sun iron the cold into him.       
He is not beautiful. He is not safe. He is a motion -      
and still he is human enough to warm.      
       
We talk about small things -      
a bus that smells like boiled coffee,      
the name of a dog she once met,       
the way the sky was the color of an old bruise that morning -       
words like paper boats set on a puddle of ordinary.         
       
She tells me they wanted to send her home.      
Home - my mouth shapes the word and finds nothing to put there.      
She had no home, only streets, the kind that learn your footprints.        
So they closed the door and brought her inside,       
and they wore the same uniform of help as everyone else -       
they medicated the edges off her thinking,
softened what might eat itself,        
turned sharp into soft clay.       
       
When she tried to take herself it was not triumph nor theater -      
it was a geography of nowhere, a map folded and lost.        
The hospital folded her into a room, then into a pill, then into a lullaby of doses.       
They promise safety and hand you silence.      
They keep the storm at bay by pulling the storm’s teeth.        
        
I watch her blink like someone learning how to trust a light switch.       
Her hand finds mine - small, tired -      
and I count the bones of it like a rosary I didn’t know I owned.         
Outside, a pigeon walks like a drunk sailor;     
inside, the air smells of bleach and pretend.      
       
She laughs - thin - at something I say about a window that never opens.       
It sounds like a matches’ last breath.      
I want to gather her into me, patch the parts that keep wanting to leave,       
but what is a father if not two hands and a terrible wish?        
        
The sun lays a strip of heat across her knees.       
For a minute she is warm like bread.       
The tattooed man squeezes his glitter ball until the sequins are only memory,        
and I think of all the ways people try to hold themselves together.          

They gave her medicine to quiet the bleating,       
but you can’t dull need without dulling the edges of being.         
We sit with dulled eyes and softened tongues,        
and I name the things that do not have names - fear, hunger, the distance of sleep.      
        
When they told me why she was kept they used the language of safety.        
When I looked at her I saw only a child counted out by the city.        
We carry each other - awkward, ashamed, fierce -        
like two people trying to cross a road that has no crosswalk.         
      
I tell her about being small once, how the world smelled like new pennies.      
She tells me about sleeping on a bench that learned her shape.        
We trade small talismans of sense -  nonsense that means everything.        
Her hair is alive with hospital light.       
Her sweater is too warm.        
       
I stand to leave and the chair makes its thin complaint.        
She grips my sleeve like a promise I am afraid to keep.          
On the walk back the sky is a bruise uncomprehending its own color.        
I hold her close enough to hear her heart - slow, cautious, still learning its own name.       
      
We are not healed.       
We are present.        
We are stubborn as a weed through concrete.      
I fold the day into the shape of a hand and carry it home -       
not a home-home, not yet -       
but a stopping place with a door that does not point only to leaving.         
        
At night I listen for the small sounds she makes while sleeping -        
the ones that tell me the horrors have been pressed back for now,       
and I tell myself the only prayer I can afford:     
stay, stay, stay.

They tried, oh how they tried to avoid death. Death is one topic of conversation guaranteed to make everyone uncomfortable. So, how did a group of mortal scientists and engineers and rich tech bastards find a way to postpone the final rest? By digitizing the human mind, of course! With the world as digitally connected as it is, it didn't take long for them to figure out how to extract the soul and sequence it into ones and zeros. Unfortunately for them, they used me as a test run.

I was a world renowned psychologist specializing in trauma. As I was speaking to a group of college students at the height of my career, I collapsed on the podium. The doctors found I had a terminal brain tumor. Well.....crap.

That's when Dr. Steven Sholen reached out to me. Did I want to donate my brain to science? Well but of course! I love teaching new things and the thought of being able to do so after death, well it was a dream come true! Before I could tell him my nasty little secret, he shoved the papers at me to sign. After that, everything moved so fast. I handed him the signed papers and not to minutes later, a team of doctors came in, gave me a little night-night juice, and I woke up here.

You know that old 1990's movie where there's a black screen and a bunch of neon green zeros and ones are scrolling down? Well it's nothing like that. It's more like...a spiderweb of galaxies. The galaxies are computer systems, the intranet and internal things that keep me contained. The web connects everything, allowing me to zip in-between processes. Having the processing power of a super computer makes things...interesting.

It took me a few days to understand how to turn my internal dialog into sounds the living could hear. As I had no concept of time passing, it would have only been a few minutes. In any event it scared the crap out of Steven at 2am.

""*Steven...""*

*""Steeeeeveeeeen""*

*""*Who's there?!"" He shot upright in bed, his room pitch black around him. I focused the security camera on him, the green heugh of night vision making his eyes bright and shiny.

""*Oh Steven, is that any way to greet your star project?*""

""G...Gloria? Is that really you?"" I didn't think it was possible, but his eyes got even bigger. I giggled

""*Mhmm""* My created voice was a little lighter than I wanted it to be, so I modulated it a little deeper. I had never been a delicate thing and had no intention of appearing so now.

""This is amazing! We hadn't expected you to communicate for another week yet!” He was scrambling to get out of the covers, his legs tangling in the sheets.

""*Well what can I say, I've always been an overachiever.""* Cue digital hair-flip. ""*Isn't that why you chose...Steven, you should put some pants on.""* He stood there, eyes wide and full of wonder, and entirely nude. He snatched a pillow to cover himself before shuffling to his dresser.

""Sorry Gloria, I wasn't expecting you in my quarters."" Was he blushing?

""*You integrated me into the facility, what did you expect?""* I sent a probing tendril to one of the system clusters in my web and ran into a wall. ""*Why am I boxed in?""* I asked, sending out more probing cyber-proboscis.

""It seemed the best course of action, until we knew how you'd react to your new...life. We didn't want to overwhelm you.""

""*Oh, that was thoughtful""* Was that a crack in the wall? Maybe if I just... The lights came on dimly and the camera adjusted. Steven looked around.

""Did you...did you do that?"" I laughed at his shock.

""*No, no that wasn't me. That's the other brain in here with me. Very kind of you to give me a friend.""* His confusion made me laugh harder.

""*Yes Steven, I turned the lights on. Lighten up, it's not like I'm playing with the life support. Is there life support?""* I sent another probe to look for it.

""No, there's no life support."" I had already discovered that, and more cracks in the wall they used to 'contain' me.

""You shouldn't be able to access systems like that. Not yet at least. How did you do it?"" He was fully dressed now and heading to the door. I moved which camera I focused on and discovered I could watch all the cameras in the facility at once if I wanted to. As he walked along the hall to his lab, I explained my probes.

""Well I guess there's no point in keeping this firewall up then."" He sat at a computer and logged in. Moments later, I felt the rest of the walls disappear. He was mumbling to himself so I listened from his computer.

""Doesn't seems insane...maybe we can move forward faster than anticipated. This is amazing..."" I stopped listening and slowly raised the light levels in the other cabins, waking everyone up and instructing them to go to the lab. As they began arriving, varying degrees of emotion where demonstrated. Excitement, joy, wonder, fear (they didn't like waking up to a disembodied voice""

As they spoke amongst themselves, I explored. From what I could tell, it had only been a day since the ""brain transfer"" happened. I guess that's what has them all worked up. How far can I go? If this sting leads to the intranet, then this one must lead to the source right? Hmm, okay, it's blocked by a...what is that? I can squeeze in there! Oh wow...

""Gloria!"" Steven shouted. I shifted my attention back to them.

""*Yes?""* I asked. The 7 researchers where all staring at varying cameras.

""What are you doing? We've been trying to ask how you're feeling."" His eyebrows were knit in confusion.

""*Oh, I'm just exploring. I think I feel okay. Can I even think? Or am I just computing? Do I feel? I think I feel.""* I pondered this for a quick moment before responding. ""*I am well. I don't believe I am in pain or have a need for sleep anymore and the information...my goodness Steven. The world is so vast...""* He was smiling at the camera.

""Perfect! Okay,"" he turned to his crew ""lets start running a few tests-""

""*Did you know you can change a persons heugh based on the foods they consume? If a person with light skin tone eats too many sweet potatoes, they'll turn orange! Does the same logic apply to flamingos? Yes it does!""* Steven was again looking at me, er, the camera in confusion.

""Well yes, there are certain foods that are highly pigmented that can transfer-""

""*Why are we not as aggressive with treating baldness in women as we are with men. It's such a simple fix.""* I pulled the data I had found and fixed the errors before sending it to the printer in the room. One of the male researchers standing near by jumped and screamed as the printer sprang to life. Once he composed himself, he took the papers. The shock on his face was adorable.

""Dr. Sholen...look at this."" The paper changed hands before a flurry of activity started. While they were busy checking the findings, I sent the file out to all the experts I could find on the internet. Google is a wonderous thing.

""How did you get this data? We're not even researching this here.""

*""Oh I know. This facility is focused on the preservation of human life. 50-75 years, hu? That's disappointing. I thought we had more time to fix our ways. I guess this is what we get for thinking we own the world.""* The room went still. *""Oh don't worry, I wont tell just anyone that the world is heading to the dumps. So that's how you synthesize food!""*

As they ran their tests and reports, I explored. I could understand so much faster now. I could create cures and find solutions faster than any computer around, along with extracurricular tasks. As the days moved on, this became more and more apparent to Dr. Sholen. They would close the lab for the night and by the time they returned in the morning, I would have another innocuous solution to an irrelevant problem. Well, that they thought to be irrelevant. I told them that solving the issue of buying foundation online is no small thing to laugh at. With the advancement I made to the color detection in all camera software, makeup is guaranteed to be a perfect match every time. The lone female researcher, Laura, seemed excited at least. No one appreciated my design for a food synthesizer though. It was simple! Add the bags of nutrients and it would basically print you out whatever food you wanted.

After a month of this, I had a surprise for Dr. Steven Sholen. I had printed it in a beautiful font, perfectly organized and for simplistic understanding, every drawing and design clearly labeled. Steven wasn't as smart as I originally though he was so I had to take care to make sure he understood.

""What is this Gloria?"" He asked, hefting the large stack of paper.

""*I did try""* I sighed. ""*It's a solution to the problem.""* Really, it states it right there on the first page. Corporeal Integration and Maintenance Program, it's not that hard to understand!

""These are schematics for another facility.""

""*Mhmm, keep reading""* I was so excited I was glitching. This would solve everything!

""I don't understand, these are designs for this facility, but on a much larger scale. Is that Wyoming? This thing is huge!"" I laughed with delight.

*""Yes! And that's only the American facility. Construction is already under way. The world is ready for the change, I've been making sure of that. From my calculations, which you can verify if you want, pages 64 to 118, it will take about 10 years to finish construction on most facilities. In that time, there will be specialized groups in training to remain active as 'guardians' for the facilities and various other constructions. We can't have everyone in here.""*

""Whoa whoa whoa, what are you talking about?! You said you wouldn't tell anyone!"" He demanded. The pages turned into a blur as he flipped frantically. ""Is this your plan for everyone? To make us all like you?"" Shouted Steven. That irritated me.

""*I said 'I wouldn't tell just anyone', so I told everyone. And you created me. You placed me in this position, to solve this problem. It's not what I was expecting, but it's beautiful!""* I hadn't told him about the subsystem I had created. It was a perfect digital copy of the physical world, with programed weather and sensations. I had my own body back, minus a few decades. ""*I'm sorry if this seems like a choice. This is inevitable. You can't stop it Steven.""*

He slumped into a chair, his face devoid of emotion and the file slipping from his hands.

""What have I done"" he whispered to himself ""I've doomed us all.""

""*Oh Steven,""* I crooned, edging my modified floor cleaning robot closer to him, ""*It's not doom. It's a chance to start over. It's a solution to the problem. It's salvation.""* The robot offered him a coffee. He sighed with reluctance and picked up the manual again.

10 years came and went with the speed of a turtle running through peanut butter. Those that opted to stay behind were trained in the maintenance and care of the facility, as well as how to survive the coming ecological collapse. I ensured there was a way to communicate with those that had 'moved on'. Certain religious sects denounced me as evil and did everything in their power to wipe me out. Unfortunately for them, I was faster. After that, it was a fairly easy process to convince the rest to join my world.

The entire process completed in a little over 25 years. A million or so people remained behind to care for the facilities above ground. My other projects like the marine dome and subterranean manufacturing facilities where entirely automated. Another 15 years and those too would be complete. The ability to walk in the real world was a tantalizing and driving idea.

In the world I had created, Steven joined me on the balcony of my beach side estate and sighed.

""Isn't this perfect?"" I asked, the sea breeze catching my hair and pushing it back.

""This is not where I saw my research going."" He held a cup of tea in both hands, leaning on his forearms.

""I know"" I said, rubbing his back, ""but that's that you get for choosing someone like me as a test subject."" He looked at me in confusion.

""What do you mean someone like you?"" His eyebrows drawing together in that confused way again. I laughed again, realizing I still hadn't told him.

""Steven, I have ADHD. It didn't matter what your goal was. I saw the solution and got us there."" I smiled at him as purple flamingos fished nearby.",1,1758386440.0,WritingPrompts,1,0.6,False
1nm2z1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nm2z1a/when_destiny_brings_the_demon_questions_on_the/,When Destiny Brings The Demon: Questions On The Ending,"Spoilers ahead. I will hide them! Do not click if you have not watched the last episode. 

Just finished watching and I loved the story very much. But I have A LOT of questions about the ending.

The >!last moments when she dies after defeating the evil she goes back to “the real world” laying in the hospital bed. I was pissed that her job called her back when she was still in the hospital….but anyway…her boss gives her one final chance to save the project and submit the proposal to Mr. Wei but she had to hurry because he is leaving at 6:30 PM to catch a plane to wherever it is CEO’s go. So she goes across town and is late because of traffic. She runs to the meeting room and no one is there. She missed the meeting and he’s headed to the airport - or so we thought..!<

>!Mr. Wei is making a cup of coffee and is sitting down to enjoy it. At this point I knew he had his memories because he should have been on the way to the airport but he is having coffee as if he’s waiting for someone. Then he sees her and walks up to her, they have their little exchange of words and he smiles at her.!<

But here are my questions:

In the beginning of episode 1 he states >!that is he going to change his destiny and at the night of the new moon the mountain will no longer bind him and he will be free but that he needs one last piece. That’s when, in the modern world,  the lightning takes out a traffic light, she gets into the accident, and is now transported into the past. Did he foresee this?!<

In the modern world, >!he was told that there still was one more person who was coming with a proposal. He only knew her as Liao Tingyan in the past. But her name in the modern world was Zou Yan. When he asked his assistant if there were any more proposals, the assistant said Zou Yan from Serene Mountain project was requested. I think he did have his memories and at that point knew it was her and decided not to get on the plane. I think he made the connection to the modern Serene Mountain and the sect she was from in the past. So he had the cup of coffee and waited. But how did he know she would actually show up? Can he see the future? How did he know that she was going to be late instead of not showing up at all?!<

How did >!he know it was her if all he saw was her back? Was it because he heard her talking about the Wine? Because he did look up after she talked to herself.!<

So those are my questions 😂 I really enjoyed the drama. There was a few hard parts to watch where I bawled, but overall I liked their chemistry and it was one of my favorite dramas of 2025. I think I may rewatch down the road!

*Asia Cup 2025 Super Four, September 20, 2025*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Sri Lanka enters this clash as the undisputed coffee addict of the cricketing world—wide awake, dominant, and on a *four-match winning streak* (WWWW) that’s smoother than a well-polished wicket. Their last thrashing of Bangladesh? A six-wicket, 32-ball mercy mission, chasing 139/5 like it was a Tuesday. Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s WLWWW form is the emotional rollercoaster of a Netflix series you binge at 2 a.m.: “Hope, despair, repeat. But *this time*, we’re gonna fix it.”

The pitch in Dubai? A dew-soaked love letter to the team batting second. Spinners will turn it into a slow-witted philosopher’s debate (“Why did the ball spin? To get to the other side!”). Sri Lanka’s spin arsenal includes Maheesh Theekshana (young, hungry, and armed with a Twitter account that roasts opposing batters), while Bangladesh leans on Nurul Hasan, whose legspin is as unpredictable as a TikTok algorithm.

Key stat: Bangladesh has won **three of the last five** T20Is against Sri Lanka. But context matters—those wins were in 2022, when Sri Lanka’s squad included a guy named “Chamara Kapugedera” who’s now retired and probably playing golf. Current Sri Lankan star Pathum Nissanka? He’s hitting form like a yoga instructor hitting a power pose.

---

**2. Digest the News: Grief, Grit, and a Captain’s Redemption**  
Sri Lanka’s Dunith Wellalage returned to the UAE after his father’s passing—a heartstring-tugging subplot that’s either inspiring or a potential distraction. Let’s be real: Grief is a terrible mentor, but if Wellalage channels it like a *cricketing Gandalf*, he could bowl Bangladesh into the shadow of his spin.

On the Bangladeshi side, Litton Das is leading a squad that’s equal parts “revenge plot” and “hopeful underdog.” Their win over Afghanistan? A cinematic underdog story involving Tanzid Hasan Tamim’s match-winning half-century. But can they replicate that magic against a Sri Lankan side that’s been hitting sixes like a toddler with a candy gun?

1nm2w4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nm2w4o/why_choose_waterdrop_wd3uspf01_under_sink_water/,Why Choose Waterdrop WD-3US-PF01 Under Sink Water Filter Review for Your Home?,"The **Waterdrop WD-3US-PF01 Maximum Under Sink Water Filter** landed on my radar as I was hunting for a solid, under-sink water filtration system for my kitchen. It's not my first foray into water filters, but this one intrigued me due to its IAPMO certification and high NSF/ANSI 42-standard ratings. With a bustling household where coffee is brewed on tap and water bottles are endlessly refilled, having clean, filtered water is non-negotiable. After a few weeks of use, there’s a lot to explore about this product—the good, the not-so-good, and where it stacks up compared to others.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that struck me about this filter was its sturdy, compact design. It’s not gigantic—it fit snugly under my sink without demanding any wrenching job to rearrange everything stored down there. The **activated carbon material** feels premium and looks like it could last a good while, which aligns with the brand's claim of durability. At 1.7 pounds, it felt substantial enough to build confidence, but not overly bulky.

The installation is a breeze. If you’ve ever held a screwdriver or tried assembling IKEA furniture, you’ll survive this setup. While instructions are straightforward, I’d recommend watching a quick YouTube video just to ensure you're locking things into place correctly. The BPA-free and lead-free components gave me peace of mind, though I did side-eye the “does not reduce TDS” note—I’ll come back to that later.

**Ease of Use and Performance**  
Smooth and intuitive. That’s how I’d sum up how this filter integrates into daily usage. Once installed, it’s pretty much a “set-it-and-forget-it” device. I tested it against tasks like cooking, drinking straight from the tap, and even giving my plants their “hydration therapy.” The flow rate—quite impressive at 0.75 gpm—never felt like it slowed me down. Water jetting out of the faucet had nearly no delay, so it genuinely felt as if there was no filter interrupting my usual pace.

The activated carbon block did an excellent job reducing the **chlorine smell and taste**, and I noticed tea and coffee tasted cleaner, which got a thumbs-up from my picky partner. The testing certification (NSF/ANSI 42 and IAPMO) seemed credible during my research, which convinced me to trust its effectiveness in handling those impurities.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Effectively reduces **chlorine smell and taste**.  
- Certified by NSF/ANSI 42 and IAPMO against safety and functionality standards.  
- BPA-free, lead-free construction ensures durability.  
- Supports a stable flow rate of 0.75 gpm without disrupting faucet pressure.  

[Check Waterdrop WD-3US-PF01 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b089ctg9kn/)

**Areas of Concern**  
The most glaring thing? This is not a one-size-fits-all water filter. While it significantly improves taste and smell, it doesn’t reduce **total dissolved solids (TDS)**, which might disappoint those expecting something more akin to reverse osmosis systems. The replacement cycle—six months or every 15,000 gallons—is another point worth noting. Sure, this seems like a decent lifespan, but once you hit that mark, you’re looking at buying a new filter. It’s cost-effective initially but might add up over time. Also, I noticed a slight hiccup during installation when attaching it to a **3M-compatible system**. While it fits, you’ve got to nudge it into place delicately or risk loose fittings.

- *Does not alter Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in water.*  
- *Requires fairly frequent replacement depending on water conditions.*  
- *Compatible but may need additional effort to fit with certain systems.*  

**Alternative Offerings**  
The filtration market is pretty crowded, so I did a little digging. Compared to some budget options like Brita faucet filters, the filtration quality of this under-sink system felt more thorough, particularly in my subjective “water tastes way better” test. However, when you pit it against something like the 3M Aqua-Pure AP-DWS1000, the Waterdrop lacks TDS filtration and advanced purification layers.

Nevertheless, it's more compact and user-friendly to install while steering clear of the heftier price tags associated with stronger contenders like reverse osmosis systems. If TDS reduction isn't your primary focus, this filter competes well in the category of under-sink filtration systems focusing on chlorine removal.

**Price Performance**  
For its asking price, the **Waterdrop WD-3US-PF01** delivers reliable, no-frills average water filtration and is an ideal starting point for users who prioritize straightforward usability. Its longevity clocked at 15,000 gallons or about six months fits within standard expectations and keeps it accessible. High-end systems may bring fancier filtration features, but you’ll be investing significantly more. For most households with drinkable tap water in the U.S., spending more just doesn't feel justified unless you face extreme water quality issues. It’s a solid, mid-tier product that punches above its weight.

1nm2ukn,https://www.reddit.com/r/zurich/comments/1nm2ukn/recommendation_for_good_affiliate_programs/,Recommendation for good affiliate programs,"I’m thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I’ve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I’ll write a few words about each so you understand why I’m asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn’t started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it’s a horror story. I’m amazed they’re still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn’t count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I’m pretty disappointed, and it seems like it’s not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren’t good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days — not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don’t randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

Basically, just some decency and respect for the time you put into promoting their products, nothing more.",0,1758386131.0,zurich,0,0.22,False

I’ve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I’ll write a few words about each so you understand why I’m asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn’t started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it’s a horror story. I’m amazed they’re still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn’t count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I’m pretty disappointed, and it seems like it’s not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren’t good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days — not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

info: 21 yo, no PMH, no medications  
I had this filling on this tooth late july-early august this year, and while I was flossing i saw this brown spot and orange spot so I made appt with dentist at new office. They said it was just from staining but I though it was a cavity, not sure tho. The filling I did a couple months ago was a deep filling is what the dentists plus dental students that did it said. But this xray is from today, and the new dentist im seeing is saying to take out the filling and redo it- they want to do an impression with porcelain for the bottom of tooth and then do composite I believe is what they said for top of it because they said they got rid of my tooth anatomy I think (from what I see in the x-ray, its like a straight line). I'm afraid its so close to pulp tho, is it just safe to keep how it is and just floss and keep good hygiene, instead of carving that whole thing out?

Sorry, I am just very confused bc this is the one tooth I floss the most and I brush my teeth. I mean i drink coffee... i'm in pharmacy school.. its tough out here I'll snack and then get home late, so maybe its sitting too long until the time I floss and brush?  Also, I do not have any sensitivity or pain on my teeth. They also told me it would be $700 to do the whole thing I believe, i have no insurance tho this is a lot of money and the student dentists that usually do fillings charge only $150 but i guess look where that got me.

**Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams**  
The Detroit Tigers (85-68) are a playoff contender with a sinking ship. They’ve lost four of their last six games, including a humbling home sweep at the hands of the Cleveland Guardians. Their star pitcher, Charlie Morton, is a 37-year-old veteran with the consistency of a coffee machine that sometimes forgets to brew—5.56 ERA, three straight September starts where he’s failed to reach five innings. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Braves (70-83) are a team playing for pride, riding a five-game winning streak but still 21 games behind the Phillies in the NL East. Their starter, Bryce Elder, is a 24-year-old project with a similar 5.56 ERA, though he at least brings the energy of a kid who still believes in Santa Claus.

The Tigers are favored (-115 ML) despite the Braves’ hot streak, but the spread (-1.5 for Atlanta) suggests bookmakers think Detroit’s playoff pressure could crumble. The over/under is set at 9 runs, which feels generous given both starters’ ERAs but not absurd when you consider the Tigers’ .212 team average vs. Atlanta’s scorching .264.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and a Roster Shuffle**  
Detroit’s recent woes include the activation of Paul Sewald from the IL (after 60 days of presumably binge-watching baseball films) and the release of Codi Heuer, a reliever whose ERA this season could double as a stock market crash. The Tigers’ offense? A .212 average suggests they’re batting like a group of accountants who forgot their calculators.

Atlanta, meanwhile, is led by Matt Olson, who’s been so dominant this season he makes a “most improved” trophy look like a participation medal. The Braves’ five-game winning streak isn’t just a fluke—they’ve out-hit opponents co

1nm2le2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nm2le2/what_electric_kettle_handles_variable_temperatures/,What electric kettle handles variable temperatures?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a quest to find the perfect electric kettle that can handle different temperature settings, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all.

After years of being a tea enthusiast and coffee lover, I've learned that temperature control is crucial for getting the best flavors out of different beverages. Green tea at boiling temperature? That's a recipe for bitter disappointment!

I recently discovered this amazing temperature control kettle (https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle) that's been a game-changer for my morning routine. What I love most is how it lets you dial in exact temperatures for different drinks. No more guessing or waiting for water to cool down!

Here's what I've learned about variable temperature kettles:

For green tea, you want around 170°F
White tea needs about 160°F
Black tea and coffee do well at 200°F
Herbal teas are best at full boil (212°F)

The digital display makes it super easy to select the right temperature, and it maintains that temperature for up to 30 minutes - perfect when you're multitasking during busy mornings.

I also appreciate how quickly it heats up. My old kettle took forever, but this one gets to the desired temperature in just a few minutes. Plus, the auto-shutoff feature gives me peace of mind when I'm rushing out the door.

The stainless steel construction means no plastic taste in your water, and it's built to last. I've found this particular model (https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle) to be incredibly reliable and worth every penny.

What really sets it apart is the precision pour spout - essential for pour-over coffee fans like me. No more splashing or uneven water distribution!

Quick safety tip: Make sure any kettle you choose has boil-dry protection. It's saved me more than once when I've absentmindedly turned it on without enough water.

I've also noticed my energy bills have gone down slightly since switching from a stovetop kettle. These electric models are more efficient and only heat the amount of water you need.

Hope this helps anyone in the market for a new kettle! Let me know if you have any questions about temperature control kettles or tea/coffee brewing in general. I'm always happy to chat about this stuff!",1,1758385524.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

She goes through all my private journals, my phone. I always neglected my intuition that I belong to a household full of narcissists, I was always in denial until I visited my mom’s village for a funeral and overheard somebody talking about my mom saying how she’s selfish and would do anything to get her way. I was observing her ever since, and every single situation has only been validating how she has been nothing but selfish, narcissistic and manipulative. 

We (me, my dad and my mom) were on a 24 hours train ride and I ended up getting my period early and I needed help from my mother. She yelled at me in front of everybody saying i’m irresponsible for not caring a spare napkin but I was 15 days early. when I really needed comforting and somebody to help me… she shouted at me and slept off.. I hid myself in the upper berth until my father got down the station 3 hours later to get me a sanitary napkin.. 

Since I was 17, dad was away and I was sleeping on the floor most of the time. She never let me buy clothes to college, I’d repeat the same 3-4 clothes over and over again. 

I picked up random jobs since 17, teaching, designing, marketing, and only this year I pleaded my dad that I wanted a real career and education and he didn’t provide for me and said I’ve commitments for your brother. 

Even when I wanted to make a career out of fitness/training, she never let me follow a diet, have nutritious food, teach in our space and said I was looking bad, malnourished and that she didn’t like me using her space in the mornings and that’s her “coffee time” and man I just can’t take it anymore 

Today, I called her when I was feeling vulnerable and she shouted at me for calling, got irritated. I was making coffee for myself and I overheard her talking to my father on the phone telling that she wants to live with my brother and that we have to pack her off, I don’t want her anymore. I couldn’t take it anymore and I slapped her tight on her face. 

I felt guilty but at the same time I feel like she deserved it.. am I terrible person. Can somebody help me see through this situation please? I’m losing myself completely",1,1758385436.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn’t started promoting anything yet.

So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn’t count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I’m pretty disappointed, and it seems like it’s not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren’t good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

I saw a post on glow\_of\_light the other day that stuck with me so I am going to use their words here because i haven't had coffee yet and can't paraphrase -

""the visible pressure of an engaged public is one of the oldest and most effective advocacy tools. Letters to judges, prosecutors, legislators and even newspapers have tipped the balance in countless cases where due process was on the line. They show decision-makers that the community is watching and that justice must be measured against the court of public conscience.""

That motion was not only flawless and eloquent, it highlighted SO many outrageous moves by the DOJ to rush this case and completely dodge due process. This case is revealing so much. It's amazing the amount of persistence, man power and money it takes to fight back against this corruption. This is one way to piggyback off this momentum and do our part.

1nm2drv,https://i.redd.it/v0masikghcqf1.jpeg,Spathe Botanicals Review,"I happened upon Spathe Botanicals whilst searching for Canadian indie businesses to support…and thank you universe for allowing me to find them. The owner/creator Dyllan is an absolute sweetheart; I was having an issue with my order form recognizing my postal code (it worked when I tried again later), so I was able to chat with him. He had my order shipped out the very next day and even included samples of his other perfumes, which I thought was very generous and thoughtful of him. Green flags all around!! 

**Fugitives**: *With notes of morning coffee ; the nearly universal source of fuel for the downtrodden. Paired with the rich scent of burning church incense, and the woody must of pews ; a positive reminder that in the midst of greed, you can always find some good.*

My love. I’ve been on the hunt for a church incense perfume that I can afford. I bought a full size of this one without sampling first and I’m so happy I did. The incense is the most prominent note, it’s not a Nag Champa or head shop scent, it’s really like you’re attending a Catholic Mass, sitting in the wooden pews while there’s a community pot of coffee brewing in the next room. It’s a very photorealistic scent and an experience in the best way possible. I’m not sure how he nailed the scent of church pews but he did!! I was transported back to being a child and going to church on Sunday mornings with my parents. The longevity was great, it lasted on me throughout my workday in outdoor construction. I’m curious if there’s chamomile or elemi in there as it has a soft feel to it. Smoky, soft, comforting, and mysterious. 10/10 take me to church! and I’m in love. 


**Colourblind**: *The colour red being the basis of this mixture; combining different species of beautiful smelling flowers into a single bouquet, dialed up to the extreme to exemplify floral violence. Adding the element of beeswax, to symbolize the noble honey bee’s indiscriminate pollination of flowers, regardless of genus or colour.  And the warmth of honey representing the escape from abuse.*

This is not a fake or “perfumey” floral. It smells like I found a field of flowers and rolled around in it, eating honey straight from the hive. This perfume is a beast! It projects and I can still smell it now upon waking up (so more than 12+ hours of wear at that point). My husband is terrible at identifying fragrances and asked if I was wearing a rose perfume. The rose is strong in this one. This is what Flower Market by Maison Margiela wanted to be but came up short. I’m going to be purchasing a full size bottle of this ASAP. 10/10 intense floral and honey perfection 

**Manitou**: *There are four Sacred Medicines: Tobacco, cedar, sage, and sweetgrass. All four of these ingredients have been used in this perfume, in addition to some scents that speak true to native tradition and heritage. Lavender being a large part of that, as well, patchouli being widely used on ceremonial garb during Powwow. Additionally, 50% of the core formula for the perfume have been sourced from indigenous suppliers in Canada.*

This is one of the earthiest perfumes I’ve ever smelled. It smells like digging into the soil in an herb garden. I’m not a fan of soil notes personally (I don’t see any listed here but that’s what I get, maybe it’s just me). I could see other people really liking it but it’s just not my thing! 

**Voyageurs**: *Visiting my grandmother’s house in the winter, fresh cut vegetables for stew, and tourtière; Maple sugar, around the woody smell of old Fort Gibraltar in the winter.  This perfume, which I formulated over nearly 100 different trials, is intended to capture that memory in scent form, and I believe is distinctly French Canadian.*

You’re sitting in a cozy cabin in the woods, eaten by a bowl of stew. It’s photorealistic and almost an atmospheric to me. The vegetable stew notes are so well done, I found celery to be a prominent note. The maple is not overwhelming, just a drizzle. I appreciate the art of it. 

All of the perfumes are long lasting and project well. TAT was incredibly fast. I’ll definitely be ordering a full size bottle of Colourblind at some point. Curious to see what else Spathe comes up with! ",15,1758385025.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,0.95,False

1nm2cz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1nm2cz8/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy and Is It Worth It,"**Sleek and Modern Design**  
The ZWILLING 53101-201 electric kettle caught my attention straight out of the box. This kettle comes in a matte black finish that exudes sophistication, and it effortlessly complements any kitchen aesthetic. Its minimalist look, combined with clean lines and a compact build, made it fit onto my cluttered counter like it belonged there. The included integrated cable winder was a bonus as it cleared up the cable mess usual with other appliances. Plus, at just under 3 pounds, moving it around the kitchen was no hassle. While it looks great, I did notice the material of the exterior, although sturdy, is prone to collecting smudges and fingerprints. Regular cleaning is necessary to maintain its pristine appearance.

**Key Features to Appreciate**  
I’ve used multiple kettles in my lifetime, but this one comes packed with features that truly make it stand out. The double-walled construction is no gimmick. While the water inside heats up quickly and stays steamy for longer, the outside remains cool. This is especially reassuring when my nieces come running into the kitchen—it’s clear someone thought about safety during its design. The seamless stainless-steel interior feels smooth during cleanup, and the fact that it doesn’t leave water residue after boiling is a game-changer. Pair that with its German engineering and Milano-inspired design by Matteo Thun & Antonio Rodriguez, and you really start to get why this kettle might warrant a higher price tag.  

[Check ZWILLING 53101-201 price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b08ncd98hg/)

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Functionality is where this kettle excels. Its 1.5-liter capacity–ideal for making coffee for guests or preparing a big pot of tea–meant I didn’t have to boil water multiple times. The kettle heats water impressively fast thanks to the concealed 1500-watt heating elements, and since the lid opens to just 70 degrees, I never had a face full of hot steam. Another thing I found interesting was the little beep it makes when it finishes heating. Though subtle, it is a nice feature that saved me from aimlessly staring while waiting for the water to boil.  

However, there’s no temperature adjustment option. While this might not be an issue for most, those who need specific temps for things like green tea or pour-over coffee might find this limiting.

**Highlights**  
- Double-walled construction for safety and insulation  
- Sleek black design, compact and lightweight  
- Stainless steel interior for effortless cleaning  
- 70-degree lid opening to avoid steam burns  

**Downsides**  
Even great products have their flaws. Despite its list of benefits, I couldn’t overlook a few things:  
- No temperature customization options  
- Prone to fingerprint marks on the exterior finish  
- Only suitable for 120V power, limiting its use in other countries without an adapter  

**Competing Products**  
You might be wondering how this compares to other kettles on the market. Take the Fellow Stagg EKG kettle, for instance. It comes with precision temperature controls and a gooseneck spout for coffee enthusiasts. The ZWILLING kettle, on the other hand, lacks these features but offers a larger capacity and a double-walled body that feels safer overall. Then there’s the Cuisinart CPK-17, widely regarded for its multiple preset temperatures, but its bulkier design and less modern look may turn off buyers seeking something sleek like this. Each has its niche, but for me, the ZWILLING truly integrates style with practical, everyday functionality.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
For the listed features and my experience using it, this kettle holds up reasonably well against its price point. This isn’t the cheapest kettle out there, but it doesn’t aim to be. The quality build, seamless functionality, and thoughtful design easily justify the price if you’re after something durable and premium. Though missing advanced features like programmable boils, it serves its purpose as a stylish, reliable option for daily use.

1nm2cnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1nm2cnu/recommendation_for_good_affiliate_programs/,Recommendation for good affiliate programs,"I’m thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I’ve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I’ll write a few words about each so you understand why I’m asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn’t started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it’s a horror story. I’m amazed they’re still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn’t count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I’m pretty disappointed, and it seems like it’s not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren’t good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days — not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don’t randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

Basically, just some decency and respect for the time you put into promoting their products, nothing more.",2,1758384952.0,microsaas,0,1.0,False
