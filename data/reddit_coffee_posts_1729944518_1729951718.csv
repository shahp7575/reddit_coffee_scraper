1gcluaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1gcluaf/family_vacation/,Family Vacation,"Good afternoon all! 

How have you been?

I know that this kind of post regarding suggestions for holidays activities and places to visit have been uploaded several times in this community and thanks to your patience responding and helping other people to plan their holidays I have been able to investigate a lot on reddit and plan my own family trip!

But of course, it's not close to be perfect or even feasible to do everything I wrote on my list. So I was hoping if you guys could check my plan and give me a feedback.

We are 3, my son of 4 y/o, my wife and me and we are from the north of Mexico. This will be their first real snow white winter holidays and that is our main purpose of this trip.

We already bought our plane ticket for the first week of January. We will stay approximately 8 days.

I read some articles about unpredictable weather Montreal have been having in the past few years which some years it really starts snowing in mid of January. is it true? that will be really sad.. 

Our plan is to book an airb&b to cook our own dinner and save some money.  I'll try to find a strategic location. 

Well.. This is my prototype to do list. 

January fisrt :

·         First hour Breakfast in good coffee shop: (I should find a good coffee shop near Botanic gardens or in the way to there)

·         Botanical garden

·         Biodome

NOT SURE IF WE NEED TO PAY AGAIN TO ENTER BIODOME... OR WITH THE TICKE FOR BOTANICAL GARDEN COVER OTHER ATRACTIONS. 

·         INSECTARIUM

·         PLANETARIUM

·         Lunch: Poutin (a MUST, SHOULD FIND A GOOD POUTIN RESTAURANT).

·         The Musée d'art contemporain's

·         Old port // White clock tower climb

·         marché jean talon. Market place



January Second:

·         café chat l’heureux : for breakfast

·         Notre-Dame Cathedral

·         Canal Lachine, walkind and bike tour (if its possible with a kid and cold weather)

·         LUNCH smoked meat in Dunn's Famous

·         walking from Crescent to Place des Arts

·         Wellington St

·         WALL OF BERLIN



January Third:

·         Good coffee

·         Mont-royal. See activities.

·         LUNCH (ABOUT 60 CAD) (I MUST THINK WHAT TO IT THIS DAY)

·         OASIS INMMERSION. (See disponibility and tickets)

·         Museum of illusion (26.5 CAD for person, kids under 5 don't pay) opens at night too. [https://moimontreal.com/en/buy-tickets/](https://moimontreal.com/en/buy-tickets/)

·         Old Montreal

·         Montreal Museum of Archaeology and History

·         Cabane Panache walk



January Forth:

·         Good coffee

·         Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal , morning is free.  Between 10 am to 1 pm ([https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/information/hours-admission-and-location/](https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/information/hours-admission-and-location/)).

·         Saint Joseph's Oratory

·         A good lunch 

·         Parc Lafontaine

·         CHINA TOWN

·         MONTREAL SUBTERRANEO. UNDERGROUND CITY

  
And the next day we will take a train to QUEBEC. I didn't plan my trip to quebec yet, but I hope I will be doing this the next week. 

I need to think about transportation, if course taking a bus will save a lot of money than UBER, but it will be much slower this way, but again it can be a good experience riding buses. What do you guys think about this? TIME > TOURING > MONEY OR MONEY > TOURING > TIME??

Thank you so much to read till here in advance !! I hope you can help me with some ideas or suggestions!

I.e. Sexting, talking poorly about me, joking about leaving me and starting a family with a different woman. I found out about these (the first big incidence was when I was 6 months pregnant with my first son and the second was 5 years after that, however inbetween there were other disrespect relationship and flirtatious behavior. He would always say it’s not serious and to basically move on from it. Thankfully we FINALLY went to couples therapy last January (7 years in) and our therapist explained to him that I basically had PTSD because of his affairs. She thought he had an avoidant attachment style and he does this cascading thing which is where you start with a “friendship” with someone of the opposite sex and try and take it one step further… starting as friends, then divulging more personal details and shared hobbies, then discussing issues you might be having in your current relationship then considering being with that person all while your real partner has no idea who this “friend” is. 

Our therapist told me I have every right to look at his phone when I feel uncomfortable about anything which I hate doing… but I looked at his phone recently and found out that he had invited a “co-worker” to a bar to hear some live music but he had also invited me separately without telling me this woman was also invited… I couldn’t go because I was picking up my sister from the airport…and then he told me that he was going to hang out with his friend Josh that night which I think that he really did… I brought it up to him very calmly and just wanting answers and of course he immediately 
exploded and told me “he couldn’t live this way “with being monitored etc. Which is NOT how he is supposed to react when I’m trying to just heal from his past actions. He later apologized but it just didn’t sit right with me. Fast forward a month and he got fired from his corporate job and this woman reached out to him to say sorry that he lost the job etc etc. and then last week he had texted her inviting her out to get coffee or go to lunch which she replied “I’d love that!” She’s also really hot, childless, apparently married (happily or unhappily who knows). But I feel insecure compared to her, even though I’m by no means ugly! Because he’s lost his job he’s been reaching out to his network and connections to “brainstorm” his next steps… so I know if I bring this up he’ll frame it as he’s just trying to find a job to support our family! But knowing his past of cascading relationships this fits it to a T. Am I overreacting over this “friendship?” 

Also I should add that we stopped going to counseling after a few really good months. And he really seemed to take to heart his actions and how terrible he’s been and how it affected me and our family and he would always say how much he loves me and wants to be in this family and how he wants to make this work. And we’ve been on a really good streak but now looking at these texts ALLL of these emotions are flooding me again. And what would I even say? “I don’t want you to go to lunch with someone who’s hotter than me” that feels so childish…  im considering waiting to see if he tells me he’s going to lunch with her or if he’s going to keep it a secret. And if he’s going to keep it a secret I fully want to just show up and be like “oh hey! I thought you were at a coffee shop job searching!” Which is what he always tells me he’s doing… I hate that I’m here again. Help! ",1,1729950946.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

We had a neighbor whose dogs were aggressive and constantly loose for a few years. So people around here are extremely fed up with unattended dogs.

It became a kerfuffle with deputies paying me a visit and rightfully chewing my butt. 

I recounted events to my WP and daughter, because I can't afford another furry jailbreak occuring. While my daughter's reaction was in line with what you might expect my WP's was an ever shifting blame game.

She was mad at the neighbor. Then she was mad at the deputies. Then she was mad at me. At no point did she even consider that I never wanted a pair of big dogs or that I had repeatedly asked for help with some form of fence.

Then it occurred to me that this is, and always had been, a trend.

She's mad at her brother for cutting contact with our daughter since d-day. She's mad at co-workers for every reason that you can imagine. She's mad at friends for no longer visiting or calling. She's mad about not being invited to girls nights. She's mad that I didn't buy her a new car. She's mad that she never got a ""mommy makeover."" She's mad that she can't seem to maintain friends.

She's always mad at others for the consequences of her own actions but never seems to accept any portion of the blame. Whenever it's pointed out that she's the cause, she just gets mad that someone pointed it out.

Shortly after getting a filling and professional clean I noticed a very salty constant taste in my mouth. I've done a lot of googling but they all describe other symptoms (bleeding gums, pain, etc). I have none of these symptoms myself but when I brush the taste is extremely noticeable or when I drink coffee/water. No drowsiness or low energy states. Food still tastes fine but particularly salty things like a chicken nugget, for example, taste excessively salty.

My dental hygeine is good now but in my younger years I destroyed my enamel quite bad and I use senstive toothepastes and floss regularly. I did notice a tiny shred of something stuff in a back tooth the other day that I managed to remove today but I am constantly poking my tongue around my mouth so I think I'd have noticed if that was causing it this long.

Initially I thought it was just a tastebud issue but during a date with my partner (note:I warned her first that I may have something up with my mouth) as we were making out she said I tasted extremely sweet and salty and it was off putting, mouthwash temporarily resolved this for her but the taste was stronger for me. She has had no symptoms after this. During a dental checkup my dentist and hygenist checked the tooth and said they saw no issues. I've had fillings before but never one of this size so I dont know if that could be the cause (composite filling). When I described the salty taste he was puzzled and didn't have an answer.



I rang my GP through 111 and he told me that considering I have no other symptoms I should wait a month to see if it clears as it may just be something routine. Its been a month and its still here and just as strong. Outside of this issue I've had no other pain except some pain in my upper left chest though I think this may be a result of how much I hunch over my desk when not working, Im also currently experiencing hemmoroids but I doubt its related. I plan on calling monday morning just wondering if anyone knows what it could be?

Ive been told dehydration by some people but I don't have a particulalry dry mouth, havent had any headaches which I usually get when low on hydration and my urine isnt dark. The only thing thats been strange is my tongue seems to be dirtier than usual after brushing (Ive always had a coarse tongue) and a few times during my day after brushing I've had a gooey white gunk appear in the corner of my gums, but in very small amounts and only rarely.

Other than the filling (which has been checked twice) the only other major lifestyle change recently was switching to Decaff coffee which I tend to drink a lot. Its lasting so long that I am beginning to worry a little.

Despite my best efforts to improve my sleep hygiene, establish a nightly routine, meditate, and adjust my sleep pattern, I still wake up wanting to roll over and spend a few minutes in bed again. It's really annoying. Getting out of bed at the last minute has affected my ability to arrive to work on time as an adult, frustrating family on vacation, and being chronically late to school as a child. This has been a recurring theme throughout my life.  
I'm fine after I get out of bed, take my medication, and have a cup of coffee, but the only other individuals I've spoken to who have the same problem were seriously depressed, which I'm quite certain I don't have.

1gclhg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1gclhg7/fasting_migraines/,Fasting migraines?,"Has anyone heard of fasting migraines? This would be a migraine that starts due to a combination of low blood sugar, low blood pressure, and an increase in histamine release (as far as I understand) and is usually accompanied by muscular pain in the back/neck. It seems like there is some correlation between muscular pain, release of histamine, inflammation and migraine. They're more common in women over the age of 30. I'm not exactly sure what constitutes a 'fast' but I'd assume it would vary based on the individual and whatever length of time is enough to drop your blood sugar low enough to trigger it. They can last anywhere from 4-72 hours and eating doesn't make them go away. I read a paper about them recently and I think this may be part of my issue. I have noticed that sometimes my migraines are preceded by significant pain/soreness in my upper back/trap areas. I always thought the resulting headaches were due to tension but now I think maybe not. I've always been a breakfast skipper and many days I can easily go from dinner to lunch without anything but a tea or coffee in between so I never gave this idea much of a thought. But as my migraines have gotten worse as I've gotten older (currently 37) I'm starting to think this could be legitimate. I'm sure it's multi factorial and also probably includes some combination of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance as well but I'm considering buying a glucose monitor and experimenting. I've also always had low blood pressure and I've wondered how much this has played a role as well. I think as migraine suffers there is definitely something wrong with how our nerves/blood vessels/metabolisms/whatever function so I think this idea has merit. 

Anyway, I just thought I'd share and see if anyone else has any experience or thoughts on this. I, like many of you, am on a never ending quest to try to figure out triggers in the hopes of decreasing frequency so I find any discussion of triggers helpful! ",2,1729950499.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

On Thursday she told me she cancelled on another guy who she views as nothing other than a friend. She cancelled because she assumed he wants more. I feel like this was her way of prepping me for what she had in mind.

We were intending to go the cinema today, but last night she sent me these texts:

Her: *Sorry, not feeling like I want to go out tomorrow.*

Me: Okay well if you're sure

Her: *Yeah I'm sure.*

Me: Is there a reason? Seems random

Her: *You said we will pay for the cinema tickets on the door. No I'm not going to pay, I don't work at the moment, and I don't pay for dates. Aww you don't want to make an effort to go out with a woman. Umm that doesn't suit me at all :)*

I didn't reply.

Her an hour later: *Also why did you unmatch with me on Hinge?*

I didn't reply. I unmatched weeks ago when we moved to Whatsapp.

Her at 1:30am: *If you got hurt in the past from your previous relationship that doesn't mean you're allowed to be insecure and treat another woman disrespectfully by ignoring her. You should just tell me you don't want to continue with me because you're not ready.*

*You should admit to me that you don't want to make the effort with me because you expect you will be treated like the past. If you don't understand that all women aren't the same, honestly that's your problem :)*

*The last thing I would ever do is leave someone unacknowledged without being clear to him. My culture has taught me to be brave and clear.*

*Wish you all the best Craig 🌹* (Not my name)

I didn't reply. 

I assume she's now blocked me because her profile picture has disappeared.

This is how one month of dating someone has ended. We'd only been on coffee dates and for one brunch. I'd paid for everything. What I noticed was that she never contended with my paying, and she never once said thank you. I originally assumed she was just traditional - she's Saudi Arabian - and I don't mind treating someone. But when paying became an unappreciated expectation of me, no thanks. That's a transactional relationship in my LifeAfterNarcissism view.

I only spent £20 on her in total over a month, but after the relationship I've just come out of, I felt extremely averse to another woman valuing me only for what I can offer her. I was going to communicate how I felt, but this happened before I even got the chance.

There's obviously not enough here to consider her a narcissist, but I'm worried there were signs. She had a lot of these stories that pertained to how desired she was from other men, how no one can believe she's single, etc. I barely responded to any of them. It could have been innocent manipulation - she could have just liked me and intended to create demand, but I recognised it and certainly felt what she was doing was a form of manipulation. 

I don't like knowing these traits are so prevalent, it's very disheartening. 

I also recognise that I effortlessly discarded her once she said something I didn't appreciate, and I felt absolutely nothing in doing it. There are recognisable behaviours on both sides.",2,1729950469.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,1,1.0,False

From my limited understanding, the drug works on the pleasure centers of the brain in addition to satiety, so the foods I normally eat aren’t appetizing. The problem is: the foods I’ve been eating and enjoying for the last decade and a half are nutritious and healthful. Of course, I enjoyed all kinds of less healthy foods, too, but my diet primarily consisted of what I made at home which included lean meats, plenty of vegetables, whole grains, etc. 
(I was a personal chef for 10 years and am well versed in nutrition, having worked with dietitians for some of my clients and working with coaches myself.)

Now, I have such a limited appetite and my body is craving foods that are easier to digest. All the delicious veggies and proteins I loved (huge carnivore over here) just don’t sound appetizing at all. Pizza was low on my list of “junk foods” that I enjoyed, but seems to be a go-to once the nausea goes away 2-3 days after dosing. But French fries are harder to get down, and that’s wild because fries are the best. Coffee and tea are also out.

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

1gcl7ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gcl7ps/my_exbestfriend_lost_her_marbles_after_she_got/,My ex-best-friend lost her marbles after she got married and aggressively flirted with my new boyfriend in front of everyone (including her husband) ,"Hello everyone! This is my first time actually posting something on Reddit... I've been lurking for many years, but I've never felt a need to get something 'off my chest'... Until now.

I wish I had it in me to just forget about this and move on, but I can't. I hope that writing this post will help. Maybe it will help some of you too. It is quite a read, I apologize about that.

**TLDR: My ex-best friend first asked me to be her maid of honour. After the wedding, she completely lost it and started trying to sabotage every new potential romantic relationship in my life, while shamelessly indulging in fantasies about being the most beautiful/desirable woman that ever lived and constantly 'micro-cheating' on her husband.**

For context, I am a 25 year-old woman who grew up in a cult. However, apart from religious indoctrination, my childhood was also highly influenced by extremely unstable parents that constantly fought every single day of their married life. After their divorce, however, the daily (verbal) fights continued, but among other family members, and soon physical altercations became commonplace as well. I spent my entire high school and college years studying, while also dealing with police, going to court hearings and driving people to the emergency room. Looking back, I don't know how I did it.

I was also taught from a young age that having too much contact with people outside the cult would 'taint my mind' and eventually lead to me 'leaving God'. Consequently, I had no real friends until college (when I became an atheist) as I had actively avoided developing any close relationships. This world can be extremely disorienting when you haven't been properly socialized. Moreover, I am also introverted and somewhat awkward by nature. I started hanging out with my ex-best-friend the year after I had finished college. I had quite a bit of extra free time on my hands, while I was looking for a job. At the time, she was constantly inviting me to different events and concerts. I went most of the time because I could and because I enjoyed the company. I had quite a few 'friends' at that point but they were all 'friends of convenience'. In essence, fellow students I went to lunch with. I knew that I would eventually lose touch with all of them because there was no deeper bond. But I was yearning for something more meaningful.

I now think that my desire to have a 'best friend' (i.e. a very close friend) and the consequent idealization that came with that desire is what brought me to overlooking the few red flags that I should not have missed at the beginning. However, the first 6-8 months of the friendship were fun. I was keeping my distance and considered her, her fiancee and any other friends in their circle my new delightful acquaintances. She and her fiancee were always on time and extremely nice to me. I knew that she had a tendency to be late to class back in college but I didn't think much of it. I took that as a sign that she 'had a life' outside studying and I respected that.

She is a very beautiful girl and also a talented singer. It would be disingenuous to deny that, though after my experience with her, I honestly can't see the beauty in her anymore. I am good looking as well - my sister is a model and there is no discrepancy in the level of our attractiveness. However, I have been praised for my intelligence since I was a child and have put my self-worth in my achievements. I have always been top of my class and while I may be naturally smart, I work hard as well. I obviously take care of my appearance but 'beating my face' to go to the grocery store is out of the question. I am only mentioning all of this because I was personally not under the impression that she was drawn to me for any other reason other than my personality. Initially, I never thought that she liked me so much because she saw me as 'below her in every way', but looking back I think that was why she initially liked me so much (even called me her 'soulmate'). I had had acne since I was 10 years old and the acne was SEVERE. It never really went away on its own and while I went to college I cared so little about my appearance that I didn't even wear makeup. How I looked seemed like a non-issue to me.

After the initial stage of our friendship, I got a boyfriend. She and another female friend in our friend group were super happy for me and I believe that they were being genuine. I was over the moon. He was my second boyfriend, though sometimes it feels as though he was my first. (My first boyfriend and I dated during college and he had a severe 'corn' addiction, which he was hiding from me. The corn addiction was the reason why he was unable to keep 'it stiff' during sex and it took us a whole year before we first had 'sex', if you could even call it that.) My 2nd boyfriend, however, was really not good for me in any way. My family pointed out that we were incompatible very early on. My 'friend', however, never pointed out how f-word up some of his actions were when I confided in her. Maybe she didn't want to get involved and that's fine... But her actions after the breakup made me realize that, perhaps, she enjoyed that I was in a much 'worse' relationship than her.

While I was with the ex-boyfriend I would still find the time to see her once every two weeks (or at the very least once a month). I finally got a job, which was not the best, but that's how it usually is with first jobs. I also decided to move away from home because I was sick of the constant fighting. There I was, a 24 year-old, a functioning member of society with a steady boyfriend, close friend circle - even a best friend, a job and living on my own. It felt like a personal victory.

However, as my romantic relationship was struggling more and more I confided in her less and less because I started feeling that she didn't really pay attention when I spoke about personal stuff. She, of course, had her own things to complain about and I was always sympathetic. My boyfriend secretly chatted with past flings on Instagram and kept deleting chats, constantly hid his phone from me and had a sadistic habit of playing songs about men cheating on their girlfriends. I broke up with him multiple times and he always came crawling back, promising he would change. There were some beautiful moments at the beginning, but I knew that the relationship wasn't healthy. Part of the reason why I was able to end it relatively quickly was because I saw the wonderfully supportive and loving relationship my friend had with her fiancee. At least that is what I thought.

So, the wedding. Me and her had been friends for about a year when she asked me to be her maid of honour because I am, after all, her best friend. I was ECSTATIC. In a way, that moment proved to me, that I was 'worthy' of friendship, that I had finally assimilated into broader society and that someone thought I was a 'good enough' person to be considered for such a role. I was no longer the little shy 'cult girl' with no social skills. Out of courtesy, they invited my then-boyfriend too. The wedding was absolutely perfect :). I was happy to see my best friend had found her soulmate and that they decided to tie the knot despite being quite young (she was 22 and he 26). After the wedding the four of us met up a few more times and all was well. They both seemed to shine with happiness. Then she went nuclear.

I broke up with my boyfriend as he had become so desensitized to my presence that he spent the entire time we were together on his phone, seemed like he wanted to reach for his phone even while we were having sex and then rolled over and opened Instagram as soon as he was satisfied. There were no more promises of being/doing better, but rather a general annoyance with having a serious girlfriend. On the other hand, he was too much of a coward to break it off with me and was biding his time. So I did what had to be done. I broke up with him and I was single once again. Getting over him wasn't very hard as I was already somewhat checked out after a few months... But I had faith during our relationship. Too much faith.

So, the next time she asked me to meet up, I obviously told her that I had broken up with him. She wanted to see me immediately. I was happy that she was such a good friend and I really needed a shoulder to cry on. But what I really got was a badly disguised interrogation session. Even back then it felt weird, in hindsight it really was odd. As she was 'comforting' me she tried to get every possible little piece of information out of me. What he said, what he did. What I said and what I did. When and where. What did he say about me? She was very interested in how he treated me and PRECISELY how he had hurt me with his words and actions. I told her everything. Then she scooped my face in her hands and very creepily said 'Oh, you look so beautiful even when you cry'. Who are you, the Joker?!?

So, some time had passed and I was trying to heal from my breakup. I had trouble eating and sleeping and resented my minimum-wage job. Life felt miserable, but there was one thing that always gave me hope. I would always think to myself that even if I die alone, get walked all over at my job and am brokedy broke broke, I still have the best friends in the world (referring to her and her husband along with her family). Her family had taken me in as though I was their daughter too, not just their daughter's friend and I got to feel a certain sense of stability that I had never felt with my family, even though I love them to bits (despite our past). That is what gave me strength. Perhaps I had to learn a thing or two about the 'real world', though, because not long after, I lost the last thing I held dear as well - my closest friend. Apart from the weird comforting/interrogation session nothing seemed out of place. To me, she was still my wonderful friend whom I adored and would do anything for.

Then it started. We would go get coffee and she would constantly complain about how a specific professor keeps checking her out during class. This was not an offhand comment either. She kept on yapping about this one professor for two months multiple times per conversation. She just couldn't stop. She never had anything else to say other than that he was looking at her as though he wanted to 'you know what' with her. She was like a broken record. Professor this, professor that. I have never personally been taught by this man, but apparently he has been accused of being inappropriate towards the faculty staff in the past but nothing ever came of it. I hope he gets punished if he did do something out of line, but the kicker is that my 'friend' was not speaking with fear, disgust or any other 'context-appropriate' emotion in her voice. It seemed as though she was boasting. However, I brushed it aside at first.

But then she started doing the same with other men and much more explicitly. For instance, my ex-boyfriend still followed her on Instagram and watched all her stories. Knowing his phone-using habits, his screen time was probably like 18 hours per day and we joked about that at first. She said 'well you did say that he's always on his phone, so of course he checked out the story and maybe he wants to keep up with you' and I agreed. And then she could not stop herself and said 'or maybe he keeps checking out my stories for some OTHER reason'. As an isolated incident this may be innocent (the word other is quite ambiguous), but during the same coffee-date we also briefly met some sleazy middle-aged music producer guy. At that point I had decided to start dating again and she said 'How about you date him?' I replied that he seemed kinda disgusting and she immediately replied 'Well, he is.' I was flabbergasted, but before I could get a word in she began with a cutesy little anecdote about how this creepy guy makes it a point to ONLY hug her before/after recording sessions, while only politely greeting the group of other female singers. Needles to say I was pretty done with her by that point, especially considering everything else that had also gone on before...

After my breakup she made it a point to always point out that it is 'so obvious that my ex never really loved me and that he couldn't wait for the day he was single again'. I am all for brutal honesty but it's uncalled for in some situations unless a person explicitly asks for it. One time (soon after the breakup), me, her and her husband were talking in their living room and after she said it he reprimanded her as he immediately saw it was inappropriate. But instead of apologizing, she sulked for a bit and didn't stop saying it (in much subtler ways) - just made sure she never said it again when he was around. He has always had a tendency to 'reality check' her on the spot but considering what happened later on I wonder how these two even got married. But I don't know the full story and I never will.

So, time went on and I was doing great, in a way. I had decided to look on the bright side. My acne had completely cleared up (I had been taking pills for more than a year at that point), I tried to embrace my personal style, went on a few dates and felt happy. At one point I even told her that I felt truly happy for the first time in my life. But I suppose the beautiful educated 22-year-old woman with a picture-perfect family, a loving husband who hands her his credit card without question whenever she needs to buy the smallest thing and a best friend who had no intention of ever hurting a hair on her body was going through HELLISH TURMOIL. I could not understand how she was constantly cranky, unhappy, on edge and found every opportunity to slide in a backhanded compliment.

I once spent my only truly 'free' vacation day to go hang out with her in the city even though I really wanted to just stay home and rest. But I felt for her because she had said to me that 'everybody' in her class had decided to ignore/bully her. When I got there she was in a prickly mood. Of course, she kept going on and on about the creepy professor. But then she added the fact that multiple girls in the class were bullying her - that they did not want to go drink coffee with her during breaks and essentially kept pointing out that she is 'dumb'. She isn't by any means, but people can be nasty. However, when she told me who was the alleged main perpetrator of these 'attacks' I had a hard time believing it, because I know the woman and she is one of the most impartial and unbothered people I have ever met. After my friendship with my 'best friend' ended, I found out the other side of the story from some college friends and oh boy... It's not hard to put two and two together.

Then we had decided to go do some shopping. I enjoy buying clothes like most women, and she loves it beyond measure. As we went towards the crosswalk, she suddenly stopped and dramatically exclaimed 'Oh my God, do I have something on my face.' I said no. And then she added 'Then I really don't know why everyone keeps looking at me.' The scene was cringy. There were many more such instances too... Anyway, we make our way to H&M (I know, not good) and the best friend in the whole universe takes a cute top from the rack and exclaims 'Oh this would look so good on you...' and I happily reply 'Thank you.' But of course she hadn't finished her statement yet '...and your non-existent boobs.' Yeah. Wow. She immediately went on to say that she has small breasts as well to soften the blow but like... What the?!?

So that was that, after that day, I was mentally done with her (pretty sure I said that already, but oh well). But my initial plan was to slowly fade out of her miserable existence. I knew it was not going to be easy, but as self-absorbed and forgetful as she is, I believed it would be possible. I had initially always told her when I was seriously talking with a guy and it seemed like it was going somewhere. But I soon stopped as I couldn't stand her immediate 'How does he look? Send a picture. How tall is he? How much money does he make? What does he do?' barrage of questions. I knew what she was doing and I was having none of it. She was getting more and more hot and cold as far as our friendship was concerned but whenever I mentioned a guy she IMMEDIATELY wanted to go get coffee. Once me, her and her husband were all having a jolly old time eating some food- a direct result of her urgently wanting to see me after I had told her that I was talking to a guy that was just one step removed from our friend circle. I made it a point to not say a word about him until she explicitly asked about him. Later on, her husband said, that there was a guy he got to know at his office building that is single. He seemed nice from the picture (an architect, and I like artsy people as I am artsy myself) and I said that I was open to going on a blind date with him. Then the ever-faithful wife jumped in immediately and proposed that our first date should be a double date. I immediately shut her down. I couldn't believe it and the husband seemed surprised that she would suggest something like that and told her that her idea was inappropriate as well.

So, once I got to know my now-boyfriend I kept him a secret. She had no idea how long we had actually been talking to each other already and our relationship had progressed quite far before she even knew he existed. At some point I confided in him about her behaviour. He said that I should talk it out with her like a grown-up (and hinted that she wasn't a real friend in the slightest) and while I (deep down) knew what was going to happen I still did it. At some point, she messaged me that she had had a horrible dream in which I hated her. That seemed fabricated, but either way, I decided to take the opportunity to tell her that I wanted to talk. When we met up her husband was also there because he had a gig nearby (he's a professional photographer/videographer). He seemed extremely distressed. Me and her went and had coffee and I mentioned all the words and actions of hers that had hurt me. She was unbelievably gracious and nice... Of course, she deflected and gaslighted and refused to take any real accountability or at least to sincerely apologize, but by then I had known that she is not quite there yet when it comes to emotional maturity, so I hoped that she would change after this conversation, even though she may be unable to actually own up to her actions irl. She also said something rather disturbing 'Me and my husband also fight all the time because he constantly takes the things I say out of context/the wrong way.'

As far as the 'childish behaviour goes', I had witnessed her child-like tantrums two times before. Once, she had gotten extremely mad at him when he slapped her hand away after she had come up to him and 'playfully' shoved a finger up his ass (he was naked in the kitchen for some reason). This happened just before all of us went to the mall to hang out (while he had a gig, as usual). (Just to clarify, no I was not there when that happened.) She stormed into the car and he took a seat in the back and once me and her were finally alone, she literally said he HIT her (implying he was physically violent, not that he slapped her hand away because he was surprised) and proceeded to tell me all the worst things he had ever done to her in their relationship. In earnest, I would have personally probably had a very hard time forgiving certain missteps he had made back then, but it truly seemed that he had matured over the years and it was obvious that he only ever had eyes for her. Later, of course, he was the one to rely what had actually happened as far as the 'hitting' was concerned.

The second time, we ended up being more than an hour late to meet my friend who had just returned from studying abroad. (After my friendship with my ex-best friend ended, this other friend admitted to me that she and the friend's husband had had a fling when they were younger but that she was too embarrassed to tell me before. I took that as a red flag from this other friend and was surprised she would agree to meet up with him and his to-be wife - if nothing else, it might end up looking like I purposefully invited her when I had no idea there was history there.) Either way, the fiancee/husband told his darling that he was annoyed that they were always late wherever they went to meet someone (note: but for some reason I was an exception to this rule back when me and her first became friends - classic love bombing). I was surprised when she didn't simply apologize... She could have said she will do better in the future or at least that they will talk about it later... But no, she threw a massive tantrum. She avoided him the whole evening, kept saying that all men are pigs (under her breath or when we were alone) and would not stop until he yielded and apologized to her. I highly doubt she had the slightest idea that the other woman (who also attended the same college as us in the past) once had a thing with her fiancee. God knows what would have happened had she known.

Moreover, she is a foreigner (she is a quarter of the nationality of the country we live in, but she grew up elsewhere, I don't care about such things either way and I am 'mixed' as well) and during our 'talk' she happily pulled the 'this is not my first language card' as if you could accidentally tell someone that they have small breasts in any language. (You probably can, but you get my point.) When it comes to the whole nationality thing, there is one thing she said at some point that has always rubbed me the wrong way... She once confidently exclaimed that 'All the women from this country (i.e. of this nationality) are cheating w-words apart from you - who grew up in a f-word-ing cult.' It felt as though she was implying that I would have been a 'w-word' as well had I not been born in a very strict religious community and even if that was not the intention... That's a CRAZY thing to say/believe. Especially considering how she acts on a daily basis.

After the conversation during which I called her out, she returned to the washed up topics of slimy professors and mean classmates as we went to shop for a bit longer. I was so tired of her. I knew it was over, though I had a tiny bit of hope that she would have a 'come to Jesus moment' and mature by like 0,5%. I was frustrated by how she treated me in private versus how she treated me in front of other people. I remembered how she had told me that everybody in elementary school had excluded her as well as everyone in high school and now, suddenly, everyone at college hated her too. She complained how her classmates held it against her that she wore shirts that were too revealing. I am not one to s-word-shame, but I also knew just how low-cut and revealing some of her outfits could be. I was torn as I had a best friend who called herself a woman with traditional family values who believed in only loving one man for the rest of her life, but, after her marriage, openly checked out other men and twirled her hair... Essentially acting as though she was single. She kept looking at who/how many people were looking at her at any given time, catching lusty glances. And after all this time, her husband was, in a way, my friend as well. However, I decided that it is not my place to talk about his wife's questionable behaviour as I suspected that he can't exactly be entirely oblivious to it. I think I did the right thing, especially after some other things came to light/happened later on.

She was very cold and snappy with me after 'the talk', but almost exclusively when we were alone/talked on the phone. When she called me to invite me to her (first - that year) birthday party she told me what we were going to do and then said 'If that's OK with you though, I don't want to offend you.' It was demeaning. I said that it was her birthday party so anything she wanted to do was what we were going to do, obviously. She was being facetious, implying I was being too sensitive about things I should not have been sensitive about in the first place. Ironic, I know. It honestly seems stupid to be even feel slighted by such a \[insert an emotionally charged word\] human being.

So, I eventually decided to let the happy newlyweds meet my new boyfriend anyway. I wanted to test my boyfriend too and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. When life gives you lemons... When we met up for a game of billiards (and had some drinks beforehand) she made it a point to talk in a weird high-pitched cutesy voice the entire time. It was far from her natural voice. Made me wince, though my boyfriend really had no way of knowing what she usually sounded like. We spent time together and the two guys clicked immediately. They got along so well, I was honestly surprised. And I felt a bittersweet sort of happiness as I knew that they would probably not get to be friends for much longer. At some point they left to get us girls something to eat and the moment they stepped through the door my ex-best-friend's voice dropped back to normal, she scanned the whole room for potential horn-y admirers and quickly blurted out 'So have you had sex yet?' It was a ridiculous question. How about you asked me if he makes me happy... Anything else other than that. I told her that since we are boyfriend and girlfriend, we obviously have. She then proceeded to ask me if it was good and I diplomatically replied that 'Yes, since we are both adults who know what we are doing, it is good. Arguably the best I've had.' I did not appreciate the interrogation, but went along with it. She then got cranky and exclaimed that she orgasms 6 or 7 times per round and also added that she is only telling me this so that I will have 'realistic expectations' for my sex life. She then sprinkled on the fact that her husband has an enormous \[male sexual organ\] and her soliloquy was (luckily) interrupted by the guys coming back.

The rest of the night she kept on with the high-pitched nonsense and kept on flirting with my boyfriend who did not respond to her advances. Her husband seemed uncomfortable and I most certainly was. At some point he (her husband) asked me if I was OK and I just said yeah. I think it was very obvious to everyone what was going on. As our meeting came to a close and me and my boyfriend went home, I told him about the things she had said when he was gone and he concluded that she must be insecure about some aspects of her relationship if she feels the need to say things like that. He also added that, while it is not his jam, he can't judge people for having an open marriage. I was in shock when he said that. Her flirting was so obvious that my boyfriend concluded that the self-proclaimed hyper-traditionalist strictly monogamous saint of a woman is in an open marriage. It was oddly cathartic to hear that.

After that, the two of them never got to meet my boyfriend again. She kept inviting us to bars and concerts and I always came up with some excuse. Then she decided to celebrate her birthday for a second time, because a friend of hers couldn't attend the first time. She explicitly told me that she did not want my boyfriend to come, while she and her other friend obviously would bring their partners. I even double checked with her just to make sure. I was fine with it as it is her birthday and since she had only met him once it is understandable that she considers him a stranger. But I hadn't forgotten about how she had once enthusiastically ranted to me about how some ex-best-friend of hers had refused to invite her then-new boyfriend (now husband) to her birthday party regardless of the fact that she had met him once before. And thus she was the only girl there without her boyfriend and she felt very excluded. (That was reportedly one of the main reasons why the two girls stopped being friends afterwards.) It must take a special talent to be that hypocritical, especially since it was her SECOND birthday 'celebration' which was essentially just us sitting around doing f-word all at the usual hangout spot. I went and acted unbothered, happy even. I am able to respect people's boundaries after all.

Unfortunately, that was not the last time we met each other. The other friend in our little 3 girl friend group also casually celebrated her birthday in a similar manner a few weeks later. In my 'plan' this was supposed to be the last time I would ever voluntarily meet her. I only attended because I didn't want to be mean to the birthday girl after I had already promised that I would come. I brought the gift and met up with them all, but I was sorry I even showed up the second I stepped in there. First it was just me, this other friend and her boyfriend and despite the fact that it was HER birthday she immediately started interviewing me about what my man is like, where he lives, what he does... It is extremely weird when somebody puts all their attention on you during their own birthday celebration, but at least she was being respectful about it. Then, half an hour later, my 'best friend' and her husband showed up. He looked exhausted, tearful even, and she was in an extremely sour mood. She sat down next to me but made sure that she put her enormous bag between us and tried to sit as far away from me as possible. She didn't even look at me. What happened then could not have lasted longer than a minute or two. The two 'friends' kept on yapping about my boyfriend and the whole thing (almost?) seemed planned. 'Omg do you know anything about him. No I don't because I've only met him once actually. Well what do we know about him anyway. Well he's 26-years-old, he lives on his own...' And eventually it seemed as though the nonsensical back and forth was over, but it was not as my 'best-friend' went off-script. She asked the other friend 'Well do you know what size of underwear he wears?' The other friend seemed genuinely surprised and replied 'Well of course not. It's probably Medium, 'all' guys wear Medium underwear.' And my wonderful angelic best friend says: 'Yes, M za majhnega.' In our language the word 'majhen' means small.

The same second she said that her husband immediately said '*Name*, no.' The other friend and her boyfriend also seemed puzzled, but didn't say a thing. I stood up and said that I am leaving. The other friend tried to stop me, asking me what was wrong. Meanwhile, my 'best friend' seemed shocked and just sat there - completely frozen and slouched over with an expression on her face that seemed like utter disbelief. She, of course, still refused to look at me. It seemed stupid to point out the obvious to the other 'friend' of mine. If you cannot see how wrong the thing that just happened is, then I really don't know what's up with you, is what I thought - but I wasn't going to say something like that to a person on such an occasion. Maybe I really should have said something more, but I also suspected that the two girls had made plans to be nasty to me beforehand, at least implicitly. It seemed like a waste of energy. Ironically, my ex-best friend had a habit of occasionally implying that this other friend was an airhead and that she did not believe that she was completely innocent when it came to some beef this other friend had with some classmate of hers. Pot calling the kettle black... I always just replied that I had no way of knowing since I wasn't there. I liked this other friend of ours even though we were not super close and I even helped her study for a difficult exam on multiple occasions. But if that other girl did agree to gang up on me based on some lies my 'best friend' told her, then I am truly disappointed. Anyway, I went home, called my boyfriend who was not all that pleased about what had happened, but quickly got over it and that was the end of the friendship.

I immediately (as I was walking away) blocked all of them on my phone, as well as any other numbers of her other friends that I rarely saw. And I thought that was that. But then, two weeks later, I kept getting calls from unknown numbers at ungodly times. At 8 AM in the evening during the week or during late afternoon on Saturday or Sunday. I knew it was her, as any unknown person would not call at such a time and would send a message after the call if the call was so important that it couldn't wait. But one Sunday, me and my boyfriend were at a restaurant and she called again and I refused to answer. However, my boyfriend believes that it is good to always answer your phone just in case. So I told him to answer it. He did and it was her. He was confused as he had genuinely forgotten her name. Then (after I blocked that number as well) she IMMEDIATELY sent him a DM. In it, she said that she is infinitely sad that her best friend had abandoned her. That I had just used her for company until I got a boyfriend (even though I went through an entire relationship while also being her friend). That I was her and her husband's maid of honour and I have now just discarded her like a piece of trash. That even though she NEVER wants to have ANY kind of relationship with me again, that she still wants to know why I abandoned her so cruelly.

He simply told her that he thought it was hilarious that she considered me to be the bad friend and also that she had the guts to message him after she had so flippantly made fun of his p-word. She then started claiming that none of that was true, that I misunderstood her. She wanted us to go out with her and her husband again and 'talk it out'. She apologized profusely - for having been misunderstood, not for what she had said. When he refused to keep hanging out, she flipped the script and said that I lied to him, that she never said that about his 'downstairs' and that I would leave him too just like I left her. That I am the worst person imaginable, he just doesn't know it yet and that he will be very sorry one day that he did not heed her warning.

I was very distressed when all of this was going down. My boyfriend gave me his phone and told me to write to her one last time just to let it all out. I did and I summarized everything that had happened in a message much much much shorter than this post. I also told her that I still wished her well and that I would appreciate it if she never contacted me or any of my loved ones ever again. The message that I got back was the most hateful attack of all aspects of my being that I have experienced in my life so far (and I hope it stays that way). She said that she does not wish me well at all because I am so rotten, that I am obviously 'intellectually impaired' if I can't understand the things she had said as she had NEVER insulted me once, that I am the worst person that was ever born etc etc. I could go back and translate it all but I don't want to look at the screenshots of her messages as they were just that vile. I want to forget the things she said just as much as I want to forget her.

So that's that. The only thing that annoys me now about this whole ordeal is that she has left the post she had made of her and me for my birthday (where she calls me 'the best person in the world') on Instagram and Facebook as though we are still friends. I have a hard time imagining somebody who had been THAT hurt by someone not deleting such a post. But hey, it's the same woman who still follows her shitty ex-boyfriend despite having gotten married and hasn't deleted all the saccharine 'best-friend' posts she had made for all her other 'horrible' ex-best friends either, years after they had fallen out.

For the ending, I might as well share what I found out about her after our friendship had ended - the reason why her entire class apparently hates her. A friend of mine from college (shocker, I have multiple friends that I am also allegedly using for friendship until I find another boyfriend I guess haha) told me that she had been extremely irresponsible and forgot to enroll in some classes on time and the whole class tried to remind her via group-chat but she had disappeared for the day. But, oh well, people like that exist. What I found out then is something I wish I could have found out earlier. Though, it probably happened during the course of our friendship. If I had known she was capable of something like this I would have never befriended her in the first place. Essentially, the girl that was later her 'main bully' had a birthday celebration and she invited virtually everyone from the class. A very close friend of this girl's does not have her own car (and probably not a driver's license either) but she, of course, wanted to attend. The party was far away, but the drive was worth it for whoever came. My gracious ex-best-friend offered the girl the opportunity go there with her and her husband (via car) and she was very happy. And then my ex-best friend bailed the day-of as she had spontaneously decided that she wanted to go bowling with her family/friends(?) for whatever reason. And the poor girl, determined as she was, spent 3 hours riding different busses just so she could attend her friend's party. I think that's a good a reason as any to not exactly like someone. As for the bullying, I doubt it happened - at least not in the form she described it. God knows what kind of ludicrous story she made up about me after I had stood up for myself - she became very distant and snappy directly after we had had 'the talk'. She might have turned her entire friend group against me long before the fateful tiny peepee fiasco. (Over time, I had noticed that she had started isolating me from her usual 'friend group'.)

Another thing that shocked me after everything was over is that my sister told me that she had always gotten weird vibes from my best friend, but she just brushed it off as her having a bad day. Back when I was with my second boyfriend, I held a party at my home. I invited the usual friend group and my boyfriend invited a female friend of his. My sister also attended and she was in full glam as she had just come home from a photo shoot. She said that she always found it weird that my best friend refused to look her in the eye and would constantly avoid her. My sister tried to start up a conversation with her multiple times but my best friend always found an excuse to scurry away. On the other hand, the 'best friend' chatted for a long time with the (excuse me for being so explicit) overweight, not-so-attractive girl that my boyfriend was friends with (who was secretly in love with him... yeah). Then, on another occasion, my sister and her boyfriend bumped into my ex-best-friend and her husband at the 'usual' billiards place. The husband was super nice to my sister, while the ex-best friend had reportedly not even stood up to greet her and sulked in the corner. Apparently, she looked as though she DID NOT want my sister to be there. I wish my sister had told me this earlier, but of course she didn't pay it that much attention just as I wouldn't have.

I finally got it all out and I'm happy that I did. I had to cut quite a bit out to meet Reddit's character limit, but that's probably for the best. I have been told by people close to me that I should stop 'carrying her with me' as that is what she wants. I know it is but it hurts to be lied to/gaslighted so thoroughly and methodically. For some time, I believed that she was planning to do this since the moment she decided to be my friend, but I have come to understand that such diabolical personalities probably do not plan all that much. It's her world and we're all just living in it. Now I am just another horrible 'bully' who cast her aside, once again confirming her skewed worldview. 'Time is a flat circle' seems to make sense after all.

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

How do I (M25) proceed with my boyfriend (M25) in our relationship? I do want an unbiased perspective but I know this is only my side of the story. 

We have been together 6 months. When we met, I was in my first year of law school and he was a barista planning on going into nursing school. I really have come to love him, but I feel like I’m kind of dating a different person entirely. 
He likes being a barista, but told me early on that he was burnt out and wants to try nursing school. He didn’t take any steps towards that so I asked him how I could help. He said I could research some stuff about local programs and discuss it with him. I did. Well, about a month and a half ago, he tells me he received an offer for a shift lead position at the coffee shop and said if he took it, he’s worried he’d like it too much and not go to nursing school. He accepted it and has been subtly hinting at not going, and said that he’s “just felt pressured to go to nursing school,” though not necessarily by me. His promotion has come with shifts extended by an hour, but I only have so much free time and when he gets off at 8, I can only spend so much time before I have to get ready for school/work the next day. When he has an early morning shift, he can’t do anything the night before. But when he doesn’t have an early morning shift, he wants to stay up late and I can’t do that. 
Additionally, when we began dating, he didn’t vape. But I was away for the first few months for a clerkship (we would see each other about every 3 weeks), and on a visit around 3 months in, I found a vape. It caught me off guard and so I asked. He explained it’s an old habit that he picked back up and he wants to quit. I kind of shrugged it off because I hadn’t known him to vape and figured it was a one time thing. I was wrong. We are into month 6 and I’ve expressed that it bothers me, but he hasn’t stopped. He says he wants to and that this is his last, and all statements of the like. But he still uses it, just secretly. I can taste it when we kiss. It just really frustrates me, and ive realized it’s a non-negotiable.

I love him and don’t want to see this relationship end, at least permanently, but I don’t know what to do. I feel like so much has changed in his vision(s) that I don’t know if we are aligned anymore. 
Do I proceed by breaking up or asking for some time? Or do I just roll with all of this? Really, any and all advice is appreciated. I don’t ever want to be the partner that is controlling or anything, but I also have to enforce boundaries that I have. ",1,1729949590.0,gayrelationships,1,1.0,False

It’s inattentive so it’s gone un noticed my whole life I’ve been ‘lazy’ and ‘depressed’. Anyway context aside ADHD medicine is not available over the counter so I’ve decided to try to create a stack with similar effects that will have at least a 60% efficacy and combined with therapy may even be the same or better. I pretty much talked to chatgpt for an hour trying to find a substitute for all the compounds and this takes in mind you’ll have to exercise for the créatine and take coffee (or caffeine) with the L-theanine.

Please rate my stack which I know nothing about and recommend anything else:

If so, what would you suggest?","I’m thinking about taking up fasting. I already KIND OF do it without thinking about it. But first let me provide some details:

I want to fast to lose fat.

If I’m doing a fast, I want to know how to prioritize what things I’m supposed to eat and also what portion sizes.

I do have an issue with portion sizes because I do a somewhat kind of basic fasting already, I’ll explain more

Im a construction worker, my job is HIGHLY physical and I also want to start lifting weights (I have a bench and squat rack with free weights in my garage)

That being said here’s my situation. I do eat breakfast. If I eat breakfast (around 8-9 am) I won’t eat until I get home or around 5-6 pm. When I eat at that time, my portion size is REALLY big. Like belly busting and feel bloated big portions because by that time I’m really hungry. 

My breakfast isn’t anything crazy. Usually stop for 2-3 tacos at the gas station with a cup of coffee. 

If I skip breakfast, I’ll get hungry around 12 in the afternoon. And then I won’t eat until around 7-8 pm and again, stupid big portion because I’m really hungry by that time. I mean that can’t be good, my girlfriend tells me my portion sizes are too big but I just get so hungry. 

I’m overweight, but not obese. I’m skinny fat. 

Since my job is HIGHLY physical, when I don’t eat breakfast or have a light lunch packed from home, my body feels so sluggish. I feel like I need energy but since I don’t have access to food at work, I wait until I get home and THATS why my portion sizes are so big. 

I want to eat good. My diet isn’t horrible but there’s lots of room for improvement. Very minimal fruits and veggies. My protein meats is good tho. I do eat more fast food than I’m comfortable with because some days we don’t feel like cooking. Maybe like 3-4 meals of the week are from fast food. 

To expand on that… if I’m fasting to lose fat, how should I structure my meals? I need to eat lower calories to lose fat…. But I also need lots of calories to build muscle if I’m gonna be working out and also to feed my body nutrients for work because it takes so much out of me.

This is pretty overwhelming but I want to make the effort to be effective in my diet and excercise

At first, sobrang ma-effort sya as in kahit wala syang tulog, susunduin nya ko para makapagkita kami. Kapag break time nya sa work, yayakap agad sya sakin para mag-rest. Pinapagtimpla ako ng coffee, etc. Nakakapagdate din naman kami sa labas kahit once a week dahil madalas nagsstay lang kami sa bahay. 

Di talaga ako pakealamera sa mga gamit nya especially sa mga personal messages pero nung nabuntis ako last year, wala akong ginagawa so gamit ko lang laptop nya lagi to watch movies/series. Until may mga email notifs and sabi nya sabihin ko na lang daw sa kanya if importante. One time nagbabasa ako ng new emails and I have to search for his SSS number email then nag appear sa result yung email nung ex nya. Series of emails na sinasabi how much she misses him up until May 2020. Never naman nagreply yung partner ko pero may mga emails na may attached screenshots ng conversation nila dati na super sweet sila and I must admit, I didn’t like it. Pero since preggy nga ako, inisip ko na lang baka gawa lang ng hormones. It bothers me until now na dati may mga nisheshare sya na painting and poem dun sa girl. Naiinggit ako kasi artsy din naman ako kahit papano and never nya nagawa yun sakin. May nadiscover pa ko na July 2020, bday nya, nag La Union sila kasama friends nya and 5 sila tas yung dalawa magjowa. Weird lang for me na silang dalawa pa nung girl yung nagsolo sa room and dun sumamasa room ng magjowa yung isa nyang friend. Do you think may nangyari pa sa kanila nung ex nya? I asked him about this pero sabi nya lang wala yun. He even told me na magkakasama sila sa room pero based sa mga nabasa ko, solo nilang dalawa yung room. I was very much willing to forget about it kaso may nakita na naman ako na receipt na nagcebu silang dalawa lang around November 2020. And may cancelled booking for a room in bacolod sa agoda. Sobrang nabobother lang ako kasi he didn’t tell me about it. Sabi nya kasi when they broke up, as in never na nagkita. They broke up 2019 yet ayan may LU, Cebu, Bacolod (di natuloy) and may nakita pa akong inquiries nya for Boracay and Thailand tickets na set to the date ng birthday nung girl. When I asked him about these, nagkataon lang daw yung date and as in wala na daw sila nun. Pero kasi, it bothers me talaga na di sya nagsabi ng totoo sakin. I’m very understanding naman and open sa mga ganyan kaso yung lies kasi and cover-ups parang masama sa pakiramdam. And naiinggit ako kasi kami, never nakatravel outside metro manila.

She was selling sex, selliimg/doimg math, shooting up/ selling Subutex, amokling fentanyl. Oh yeah and she'd lost 6 children to DFACS but somehow let her keep the last one (2 yrs old) even though the baby was born with meth in her system.
So in August we packed up and headed to Ga. When we got there my husband laid down the NO drugs were allowed to be sold or done the house. People  weren't allowed over. She's 38 and my husband is 56. She kept telling him she had to sell meth because that way she could take care of her baby and buy her milk (lol) and the people that come see (2 am) her are just friends and they are good people.So she starts hotel hopppimg and couch surfing but pops up about ones a week. She kept offering to make me coffee, eggs for the kids, etc. I politely decline. One night
My husband comes out of the bathroom freaking out bc the toothpaste tasted funny and he was worried she'd put meth in it. So 9/4 DFACS is called with allegations and take drug test for everyone in the house (Me, my husband, father- in-law, his girlfriend and after speaking with the girlfriend they wanted the hair and urine of my 17 and 16 yr old.
They made a safety plan on 9/4. Didn't have any comtact (email)until 9/25 w/results, but didn't come to the house until 10/3 with results.she never laid eyes on the kids Mine was Subutex, benzodiazepines (both prescribed) and METH!!! I was like no way!!! My husbands was THC (weed card FL) Subutex, prescribed but Meth also. I was flabbergasted. She the told me she wanted me to observe an Family Court on 10/9.They really Push it bc they get funding, it cost $2000 and $55 a month and it's 18-24 months. Somebody called 10/16 and scheduled some sort of assessment for 10/25. Again case worker has emailed me 1 time and called 1 time about the FTC. Well 10/23 she pops op and wants to see the kids. My husband's was withwm at the park. They took my children. But my main question myself, husband, teen daughter, teen son tested positive for meth.

Me and her met at a cafe and in the beginning I was really nervous, as I didn’t know what was her reaction because her reply was only “Hi, let’s talk over a cup of coffee:)” 

When I was waiting for her, I could feel my back sweating and overall, lots of emotion. Tracy arrived and I finally understood why Mark was so obsessed with her as she is definitely one of the most beautiful women I saw. She’s pretty on the pictures, but personally she looks better.

Tracy said hello to me and asked if I’m willing to go to her house to talk, since being outside for too long makes her really tired. We ordered some coffee to go and it was super awkward. 

So now let’s talk about what she told me: first of all, she apologized for being the reason why now I’m single which I assured her is not her fault. 

Tracy said she received the invitation, but was simply not interested in participating in our wedding as she was already in a happy relationship and is pointless to see a person from the past.

With the story Tom and Mark told me, I got curious and asked about them “staying friends” as it sounded like she wanted to stay with him after the break up and it’s the polar opposite of her behavior. Tracy was extremely uncomfortable with this question, but still explained to me why she said that.

In the beginning, she was really in love with Mark because he was her first love. She described him as a protector, someone trustworthy, handsome and kind as he always showered her in gifts and travels.

Everything was fine and sweet but over time, Mark started to beg her for sex so much to the point of her pretending to be sick just to avoid him. She just didn’t wanted to sleep with him and had some sort of blockage, like a sixth sense telling her to not do this.


She was sick and tired about all of this and used the fact that her parents are extremely religious to justify why sex was off the chart. This lead to a fight, which Mark never told me and them breaking up. 

But two weeks after, they started to talk again as she felt in debt with him as he helped her get a job in a prestigious company and he spent a lot of money on her with trips, foods and presents. One of the gifts was a Rolex for her 18th birthday, which made me mad since he NEVER spent so much money on me.


So when Tracy found out me and Mark was seeing each other, she felt relieved and finally had a proper reason to block him everywhere since he was still sometimes hinting about them sleeping together.


In the end, I told her in the entire relationship, Mark would sometimes talk about her and in the beginning it was kind of weird, but I just brushed it off since she was part of his story. 


Oh, I also talked about Mark’s numerous accounts and in the beginning she didn’t believed me. But I showed her the accounts I knew, which was creepy since they all had female names, followers and pictures. All of them looked real.


Her account is public, so I asked Tracy to make it private. She made a new account with her Korean name and deactivated the old one.


We had fun and became friends. She is a really sweet person and I saw how her boyfriend treated her like a queen. I’m happy she found love and got rid of Mark. ",94,1729948655.0,offmychest,13,0.95,False

Don't really think it's sexism but am looking for advice,"I'm the only woman engineer at my company (a startup). I'm fortunate that the atmosphere in the company is quite inclusive and I don't feel put down because of my gender. For that reason, **I don't believe the following issue is related to sexism**, but I am just really at a loss for how to improve the situation.

I've noticed that people really don't want me involved in meetings or discussions. I'm trying so hard not to let this devolve into a self-pity ""wah no one loves me!"" but honestly I'm going crazy. I work so hard at work to give off a confident, knowledgeable, professional vibe, but this is one huge sticking point. Concrete examples:

1. I recently led a brainstorming session. The structure of these is always the same and involves 5 minutes of rapid-fire idea-writing on post-it notes. I prepped everyone with the context, handed everyone post-its and sharpies, put the clock on the projector, hit start... and then my manager said he's going to go grab a coffee and everyone followed. 
2. I'm the only engineer on a huge project. For structured planning meetings, I make a meeting agenda but no matter how the meeting starts, I always end up as the note-taker. I struggle to see how this can be improved -- because I'm the only engineer, all discussed action items are for me alone, and I have to ensure that they're recorded carefully. Because I'm busy taking notes, I can't guide the discussion. 
3. For impromptu meetings on the aforementioned project, I'm just... not included. I'll randomly hear about some plan from my manager or someone else on another project and he'll ask me what I think - often the answer is that they didn't consider some piece of logistics that made the plan unworkable. I repeatedly ask to be included in even the impromptu discussions but this isn't enough.

I've asked for feedback on this in both my normal and skip-level 1:1s, but I always hear ""you're a valuable addition to the project"" and it's left at that. Pushing further would sound petty and self-deprecating. When I attend meetings, I do ask questions, but thoughtful ones that are usually met with a ""great question!"" I try my best to mimic ""man energy"" and, quite frankly, limit my personality accordingly in groups (limit laughing, smiling, try to exude confidence, etc.)

Because of the variance in people and projects involved, I really think this is a \*me issue\* but struggle to identify it. Of course, no one here knows me so the advice I receive will be limited - but I hope that someone has gone through this and can pinpoint what **their personal shortcoming was** so that I can identify my blind spots.

Then the jeep came, we ride, and at SMSL said my last thank yous to her for sharing her umbrella with me. But I somehow regret not asking her name.

I wanna know if i am tripping or not, i am a male i have a friend who is also a male and we have been closed friends for 2 years like we are so closed so that we sleep in the same bed when i am at his house, we basically understand each other so much, anyway after 2 days i was with him and we were talking until we fall asleep sleep on each other. Next day we were planning to go to another city so he can show me his new car, that night another friend of him was with us so the other friend slept on the couch and we both slept on my friend‘s bed. 
So the morning came and i said I cant go because i didn’t slept well so you guys can go without me, the went and i was a lone at my friend‘s house, i woke up am hour later i made me coffee and showered and I made the bed and then went to my house he texted me if i am a wake i said yes and i am heading home. So the day went okay, the next morning he texted me if i took his 500€ he was putting in his bedroom closet, i was so confused but i said no i didn’t why? He said because i put it there and i didn’t found it, i said okay and you are suspect me that i took it? 
Then he said did u closed the door well after you left? I said when u were back home did u found it open? 
He said i didn’t came home after i arrived i went to work my friend came home. 
I said okay did u asked him if he found the door open when he was there? He said no he found closed.
Then i was like okay then why are you suspected my? 
He said well i thought that u took it as a joke and you will give to me when i will realise that its not there. 
I said no i didn’t took any 500€  from you matter of fact i dont even touch his stuff even when he is a round. Anyway i was so upset that he suspected me but yeah. So i asked him what about your other friend he was also at your house alone. 
He said well i asked him he said he didn’t took it either. So last night we were talking and he said that his friend said i took the money and i went with it, and he said to me i told him no i know him very well he don’t do that, but the his friend gaslighted him that what he is thinking is wrong. Anyway i was like what about doing fingerprints so you can prove who really did it because i was very very upset and he said yeah he will do that but he is waiting for the person who is doing that because the person is on holiday. So his last words were swear to me that you didn’t took it, i was like bro i swear to got i didn’t took any 500€ from you and now i want you to do that fingerprints thing so this is what will determine who took the money. 
The thing is i have two theories the first one either his friend did this so me and my closer friend won’t be friends anymore because he is jealous or he hate me, or my closer friend made all this up so that we can never be friends again. Because i am really counting. Can anyone tell me i am tripping or what is this? I need opinions please. ",1,1729947786.0,BinIchDasArschloch,3,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

 constantly observe our surroundings...

 constantly prioritize and reprioritizing tasks....

make split second decisions in high stress environments and whether it's deemed as right or wrong making it a positive outcome.....

break down/simplify complicated tasks in order to quicken completion times.

From the sidelines we see Meggy, Mario, Ragatha, and Shiro cheering them on as they both steel themselves for what comes next. 

Ragatha: Alright, let's keep this simple. First one to knock the other out of the ring wins. 

Tari's Glaive blinks into her palm with a shower of blue sparks. In her offhand, a blue ball of flame ignites as her gauntlet forms.

Tari: Just as we practiced. You ready? 

Pomni: You kidding?

A pair of prisms begin to form around Pomni hands, creating a formittable set of gauntlets. She clashes the knuckles together with a crystaline spark. 

Pomni: I've been waiting all week to test these out! 

The air crackles with anticipation as Shiro raises his hand into the air. 

Shiro: FIGHTERS READY! 

Meggy: Give it all you got, Tari!

Shiro: THREE........

Ragatha: I believe in you, Pomni!

Shiro: TWO.......

Mario: Can I have a hotdog please? 

Shiro: ONE.......

SMG3: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

Anticipation gives way to confusion as they all turn to SMG3 flashing the biggest smile on his face. 

Clench: Dude, really?

Meggy: Ugh. This better be important, Three.

SMG3: Oh, it is! With the success of the Café (and our ""supplementary"" financial efforts) I have been working on the next big step for the past week and am proud to present said next big step to all of you. FOLLOW ME!

Pomni and Tari just shrug. It seems as though their sparring session will have to wait. The group now stands before the result of SMG3's weeklong project. The building itself looked noticeably larger. Two single-story extensions on each side and a three story extension at the back form a ""throne"" around the central Café. A new name now sits atop the massive bomb prop on its roof.

SMG3: Welcome........to THREE'S LUSTROUS LAIR!!!!

The group now seems at least somewhat interested in what SMG3 has to say as they step inside. Everything feels so much bigger now. To the sides of the Café counter we now have a fancy diner and kitchen to the right, and to the left we have a pub setup with a drink bar. And of course, you can't forget the barrels of plushies and the racks of various weapons he has for sale. 

SMG3: This marvelous venture now provides much greater amenities that'll help expand upon my brand. Along with our signature Coffee and Bombs, we now have a Devious Diner for lunch and dinner, and there's always the option of happy hour specials for the ""legally"" ambitious over at the Graveyard Shift Bar. 

Mario: OH, does that mean you make.......?

SMG3: *sigh* Yes Mario, we now serve Spaghetti. 

Mario: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!

Tari: Hm..........

SMG3: What? Too impressed to speak? 

Meggy: As impressive as it is......... this place seems awfully big for one guy to run. Especially since he's usually out gallavanting for ill gotten gains. 

Tari: Yeah, you aren't exploiting those poor Echidnas again, are you? 

SMG3: Oh god no! I'd never do such a thing to Terrance's friends and family! Besides, I'm not necessarily alone on this one. While I am still the boss, it's about time I had a more efficient system for running this place. A new manager will help things run a little more smoothly.

The rumbling of engines can be heard at the back of the complex. 

SMG3: Oh! That must be the crew coming back with our new employees!

He heads over to the back door and leads the way into the back of the complex. The first floor appears to be a workshop, complete with a working forge, several worktables, and a variety of machines meant for maintenance and construction. The second floor is a lounging area with a large projector screen and............ a double decker couch. Awesome. There's also a small bar that Rob is currently tending to.

Rob: Corn Colada?

The top floor is where things get interesting. SMG3 flips a switch and a large gate opens in the back of the building, revealing a custom made Airship dock. A bridge unfolds onto the ship's top deck where several new faces are waiting. One was a mighty tall Boo Woman in a seafoam green dress, with a much smaller Boo in a green vest and hat by her side. A pair of blue-in-black eyes peer from beneath her wide brimmed hat as she makes her way across the bridge where SMG3 is waiting. She was quite the imposing presence as she looked down upon the crew before her.

SMG3: Everyone please give a bow for Mrs. Martha Mildenhall. Pleasure to have you here, ma'am. 

Martha: The Pleasure is all mine, Mr. Three. And you must be his....... companions. I must say you are quite the colorful bunch.

Mario: Are you calling Mario gay? 

Meggy pulls his hat down over his head to shut him up. 

Tari: It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Mildenhall.

Martha: Oh please, call me Martha.

Three more figures make their way across the bridge. Two young women and one young man. They looked like triplets, all bearing the same pale skin tone, ivory white hair, radiant yellow eyes, and thin arrowtipped tails. There was also these circlets on their heads bearing a set of glowing bulbs, as well as these metallic talon-like arms and legs. The boy dawned a pilot's jacket and hat with a pair of cargo pants. One girl wore a blouse with a variety of pens in its pockets, and her hair was tied into two neat pigtails. The other wore a winter coat that extended all the way down to her calfs, with most of her face obscured by a collar that covers her mouth and nose. 

Martha: And these are my three little helpers. Why don't you introduce yourselves.

The young man came first. He was positively BEAMING as he greeted the crew with a salute.

???? Salutations new neighbors! My name is Noah, and I'm THRILLED to be working here with you guys! Over here is my antisocial sister Vale.......

The sister with the coat just waves.

Noah: ........and over here is my beloved big sis Julia! 

The sister with the pigtails does her best to look presentable. 

Julia: Ready to serve. 

Tari: What about her?

She points towards one more figure making its way across the bridge. She had all the same traits shared among the other three, but appeared much younger with a maid's dress and bonet. She ignores the crowd and rushes straight to Noah's side.

Noah: Oh, Hey there, Cyn. Didn't think you wanted to come out. 

SMG3: Now, if you would follow me, I'd LOVE to give you a tour of our newly refurbished establishment. 

SMG3 and Martha head back down to the Café, leaving the rest of the group with the siblings. 

Pomni: So......... um........., I was gonna say I like......... whatever it is you have going on here.

Noah cocks his head in confusion.

Meggy: I think she's talking about your look, like the circlets.

Noah: Oh, this little thing? It's actually an auxiliary optics array, but thank you for noticing. 

Pomni: Then there's your matching gloves and boots........ wait, is that a knife?

He looks down and notices the switchblade-like claw hinged between his knuckles. 

Noah: Oh! I'm so sorry about that.

He quickly and hurriedly folds it back into his hand with a nervous smile.

Noah: The hinges get loose sometimes.

Tari: Are those......... prosthetics?

Noah: Well, yeah. It's......... it's a long story. 

She can notice the somber look in his eyes as he says that, same as the other two.

Tari: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to strike any nerves.

Noah: Oh no no no no no. It's fine. Just.......... um..... 

Julia: We should get going. We're likely overdue for orientation. 

Noah: Right! What She said. 

And so the four head downstairs for their ""orientation,"" leaving the rest of the group in the hangar. 

Pomni: Well they were certainly....... interesting.

Last year there was a lot of gossip and drama about me and several coworkers. I did it out of friendship and the kindness of my heart but it got misinterpreted and people said I had a crush on her. Things like get her coffee once a month while I didn’t always do it for others. She was just someone I felt I befriended and admired and a part of me feels people were jealous ( I’m a straight female but probably didnt help my age and being ‘single’

So some coworkers gossiped about her being gay and me trying to woo her etc and then I got called by hr and told to stay away and not contact her. When I tried to to apologize and see her perspective just because I was confused and thought of her as a friend she ratted me and went to hr to complain. Eventually she talked to me again agreeing to be friends but when I mentioned meeting someone and dating she went to hr all of a sudden saying she felt harrassed. She is now at a different location. 

I am having struggles as I am again under contract and my boss has read emails both personal and private and some of the things were taken literally/the wrong way. Like nothing bad but more personal things I shared as a friend (not someone who is just your typical coworker) I wrote a rebuttal but now it’s part of my record. Plus I must due to my job work with the lady who told the coworker I have a crush on her and several other coworker/ know what went on. My parents encouraged me to stay as I didn’t apply to other jobs in time prior to my contract and felt if I left I would be running away and it would look more guilty. I had no intentions other than friendship and never any romantic interest in her

But for me it is a struggle as the coworker that left and the one that started the rumor and straight up told her I liked her have more friends and influence at the company. In fact both of them and our boss are friends on social media and talk and respond to posts daily. 

I now know and see there is no reconciliation with the “friend” who now I realize isn’t as much of a friend as I thought. She went from saying she hoped we work together and know each other for years to come to sharing personal info and pics with me saying I’m lovely inside and out and that she considered me a good friend to basically what I feel is hatred and turning on me. Personally I feel she has her own issues and feelings to work out regarding her sexuality etc-I’m just sorry I feel I somehow got caught in the midst of it

I thought with her gone and my own history ir would be fine but it’s all a bit much and challenging as well as stressful for me. I feel I can’t trust anyone and have to walk on eggshells especially around the coworker who is still there who talked about me because she plays and pretends to be nice but she has loose lips and is close enough with the management. I mean in some ways she’s the reason why this happened to me. The other thing is I asked her twice on separate occasions if she was the one who told and she lied to me.

""What do you want to do Captain?"" Joseph asked, rubbing his hand through his hair. 

Captain Finnegan stopped pacing and turned to them, ""We have a name, Samuel Barletta. We know he's somewhere in this city, we have his age now, and his description. Let's put out a search.""

""More than likely, he's going by a false identity. He's probably working as a veterinarian somewhere as well...how else would he be able to get that amount of rocuronium and formaldehyde that was found in his hideaway."" Joseph added. 

""Even if he managed to fake a good enough identity to get a veterinarian job, they would notice that amount of product missing."" Phil said calmly. 

""Perhaps he stole it. We can look into recent thefts..."" Detective Addison started.

""I doubt it. More than likely he purchased the stuff from the black market. With enough money and the right sites, you can purchase anything on the dark web."" Phil interrupted. 

Captain Finnegan nodded, ""We'll check and see if there have been any drug thefts in the surrounding cities and I'll have computer forensics see what they can find on the dark web."" 

""Yeah, all of his shit was destroyed by Ms. Moore in the fire. If he wants to start again, he'll have to replenish. If we could find his supplier, we could find him..."" Detective Addison said solemnly.

""Where is my husband?!""

A sultry and sonorous voice rang out from around the corner interrupting their conversation. Captain Finnegan gestured for Detective Addison and Joseph to check it out. They walked down the hall and around the corner briskly where officer Lena was calming down a tall, shapely, curly redhead with emerald green eyes. Her fair skin was covered in freckles that adorned both her face and chest. She wore red lipstick that matched her expensive red dress and heels. Holding her hand was a smaller version of her, a young girl around 10 years old. She wore a backpack over her private school uniform. 

The young girl was nearly identical to the woman except her curly hair was dirty blonde and her eyes the same piercing blue Detective Addison and Joseph had just been looking at on Dr. Remini. Detective Addison and Joseph walked over to the woman and introduced themselves. The woman introduced herself as Mrs. Mona Remini and her daughter as Ivana. Joseph smiled warmly at Ivana who blushed and shyly smiled back revealing braces and dimples. 

""My husband's secretary called me when I was at an event earlier and told me he had been arrested and to call our lawyer! I got here as soon as I could. I demand to know what's going on!"" The woman demanded angrily. 

""Please calm down Mrs. Remini...We just needed to ask your husband some questions concerning a case we're investigating."" Detective Addison replied calmly. 

""Don't tell me to calm down. His secretary said you dragged him away in handcuffs! That doesn't sound like just asking questions!"" Mona replied angrily. 

""Mrs. Remini, why don't we go to the conference room and have a talk?"" Detective Addison said calmly, gesturing down a hallway where the conference room was located. 

Mrs. Remini calmed down with a deep breath and shook her head in agreement. Detective Addison asked Officer Lena to sit with Ivana while he and Joseph led Mrs. Remini to the conference room. They all sat at a round table where they explained the case in semi-detailed terms. Mona listened intently, her pale face flushing red at the mention of Samuel Barletta's name. 

""You're telling me... Samuel isn't dead?"" She asked in a quivering voice. 

""We have evidence that suggests he is very much alive and dangerous. Have you noticed anyone lurking around? Have you seen anything unusual?"" Detective Addison asked. 

""No...not that I can recall. Oh my God, are we in danger?! I mean, he followed us to this state!"" Mona asked, her face taking on a frightened look. 

""Don't worry Mrs. Remini, we'll put some police protection at your home for the time being...Do you think your husband or anyone on his side of the family has had any possible contact with Samuel?"" Detective Addison asked softly. 

""No, of course not! Everyone thinks he died six years ago...Also, Andreas's aunt blames him... and herself for his ""death."" She's made that clear every time we've seen his family over the years."" Mona said leaning back in her chair. 

""I see...if you come across ANYTHING suspicious, I mean anything, please call us."" Detective Addison said handing Mona his card. Joseph handed her his as well. 

They walked her out to the waiting area where Officer Lena was with Ivana and told her to have a seat. She did so with the frightened look still on her face. She attempted to play it off when Ivana noticed. Detective Addison and Joseph walked back to Captain Finnegan and Phil. Captain Finnegan was in the middle of releasing Dr. Remini who was signing some forms under the careful watch of Mr. Levine. Detective Addison and Joseph walked over to join the conversation with Mr. Levine and Dr. Remini. He was advised not to leave the city and to contact the police department if he came across anything Samuel related. Dr. Remini agreed before being led to the waiting area by a uniform cop where he was greeted happily by his family. 

""Let's start the search for our suspect, Samuel Barletta!"" Captain Finnegan said looking determined. 

""Yes sir!"" Detective Addison and Joseph replied simultaneously. 

Andreas was well aware that the police weren't completely convinced he didn't have anything to do with the crimes. He had been followed back to his villa yesterday evening after his humiliating arrest and ordeal at the police station under the guise of protection. He looked out of his bedroom balcony doors at the unmarked police car stationed across the street as he sipped his coffee. He had decided to take the day off and decompress. 

Claudia had been instructed to forward any important client and patient calls to his cell. Mona had dropped Ivana off at school like normal to not alarm her and was headed back home. They had stayed up late speculating and talking about Samuel and the murders and would continue the discussion when she returned. They had even contacted his side of the family and asked if anyone had spoken to him. His parents thought it sounded ridiculous and his aunt rebuffed him and hung up. The whole thing seemed like a bad dream he needed to wake up from. 

Andreas cell phone rang and vibrated on the dresser. He walked over and picked it up. The number read ""private.""

""Hello, Dr. Remini speaking."" Andreas answered politely.

""Hello cousin."" 
 
An all too familiar voice replied on the other end, causing Andreas to drop his mug and freeze in place.

He and Joseph walked back into the hallway where Captain Finnegan and Phil waited. They both looked just as shocked as they felt. Captain Finnegan crossed his arms and paced back and forth a bit looking in at Dr. Remini who was still teary eyed and pale and Mr. Levine who was trying to comfort him. 

""What do you want to do Captain?"" Joseph asked, rubbing his hand through his hair. 

Captain Finnegan stopped pacing and turned to them, ""We have a name, Samuel Barletta. We know he's somewhere in this city, we have his age now, and his description. Let's put out a search."" 

""What about Dr. Remini, are we cutting him loose?"" Detective Addison asked. 

""For now...let's have some uniforms keep an eye on him though."" Captain Finnegan replied.

1gck7sb,https://i.redd.it/iogga6c8j3xd1.jpeg,I lost 100 lbs in under 6 months and have taken control of my diabetes.,"I started Ozempic in early May, weighing 350 lbs, and in less than six months, I’ve lost 100 lbs, bringing my weight down to 247 lbs!

When I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic early last year, I was put on Metformin to help manage my blood sugar. At the time, I had already gained a lot of weight, and the trend continued, eventually leading to type 2 diabetes. My eating habits were out of control, and my glucose levels surged, with fasting levels in the high 200s.

It wasn’t until May of this year that I began taking Ozempic. Since then, my blood sugar levels have stabilized and now fall within a healthy range. My A1C has dropped dramatically, from 10.5 to 5.2. Cutting out soda was a game-changer—my biggest hurdle in managing diabetes. Now, I limit myself to one soda a month as a reward for staying disciplined. I still enjoy coffee with a non-sugar creamer and a bit of sugar in the mornings, but it doesn’t seem to spike my glucose anymore.

Overall, I’ve adjusted well to the medication. At first, each dose increase caused some gnarly stomach issues and frequent trips to the bathroom, but those side effects eased as I adjusted to each dose. Now that I’m on the maximum dose of 2mg, I handle it much better. Occasionally, I’ll have a rough bathroom the morning after the shot, but it’s far better than when I started and less frequent.

Alongside the medication, I’ve added casual exercise, like walking miles each week with my dog and doing push-ups, sit-ups, and light weight curls at home. While I’ve made small tweaks to my diet, Ozempic has been the key to controlling my portion sizes—something I’ve struggled with for years.

I’ve also stayed disciplined with snacking, only doing so when my blood sugar levels require it or as a reward for hitting smaller goals on my way to bigger milestones.

I’m incredibly grateful for this medication. I know it doesn’t work for everyone, and I feel fortunate to see such positive results. I hope that others who are struggling with their health can find similar success and support on their own journeys. I’m still working toward losing more weight and staying on track, and I hope I can reach my goals I've set for the end of the year. ",100,1729946536.0,Ozempic,4,1.0,False

Currently preparing a cup of coffee to enjoy with some light reading or studying. I'm  a tech/computer guy job hunting after completely internship as a web developer, it's been a great experience and I'm excited to move forward. At the same time trying to broaden my horizons and develop my skills in computer science as well since I've been mostly just learning wev dev stuff. For anyone in a similar field I'd be happy to exchange stories and experiences and maybe you could help me finally decide on a couple of projects to work on, but no pressure. I enjoy reading books (though my pile of books that I've yet to finish would probably contest said claim), code (currently working on a recipe blog and also a udemy javascript course), play video games,though mainly Grim Dawn and star rail(yay new jingliu relic set). Huge fan of most From Soft games in general, albeit I've yet to play demon souls and armored core. Some other favorite games include Dragon Age, The Witcher (surprisingly all 3), Divinity Original Sin II, Dragon's Dogma, Valheim, Detroit: Become Human, Horizon Zero Dawn, Stardew Valley God of War. This went on for longer than I'd have liked so let's get back to books for a bit. I'm mostly into fantasy, and history but have also been delving into Japanese Authors over this past year and it's been great. Furthermore I listen to music a lot and would be down to share recommendations and playlists! Granted I've been listening mostly to game osts, pop and kpop but totally down to try something new. Also a fan of shows anime and impatiently waiting for the next episode of re:zero with excitement, finjdhed Love Next Door on netlfix and loved it a lot. Unsurprisingly I read manga as well and am still trying to decide on how I feel about jjk's ending. I feel that I've rambled for long enough so I'll cut this short by mentioning I love animals and would be very happy to see your pets! Thanks for reading!",1,1729946496.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

**1. Personalized Home Decor**

One of the best ways to make a wedding gift meaningful is by personalizing it. Customized home decor items can make a new house feel like a home. Monogrammed throw pillows, personalized doormats, or even wall art featuring the couple's favorite quote or their wedding vows are all great options. These gifts are not only practical but also add a personal element that brings warmth and love into the couple’s space. Personalized decor is perfect for helping the newlyweds create new memories in their shared space.

The couple will appreciate the thought that goes into capturing their likeness, and it’s a great way to bring some playful charm to their big day.

**3. Subscription Box for Couples**

Subscription boxes have grown in popularity in recent years, and they make an excellent gift that keeps on giving.

You can opt for a subscription that aligns with their hobbies or helps them try new activities together. From artisanal coffee to gourmet chocolates and date night-themed boxes, these gifts provide the couple with moments of joy long after the wedding day is over. It’s like giving them a monthly reminder of the love and care you put into their gift.

**4. Cooking or Art Class for Two**

Experiences are a wonderful gift that create lasting memories. Many couples love spending quality time together trying something new, and gifting an experience like a cooking class or art workshop is the perfect way to facilitate that. Whether it’s a pasta-making course or a pottery workshop, an interactive experience allows the newlyweds to bond while learning a new skill. If they’re interested in a more adventurous experience, consider giving them a gift certificate for a hot air balloon ride or a wine-tasting tour. These experiences can add excitement to their new chapter of life together.

**5. Personalized Recipe Book**

For couples who love to cook together, a personalized recipe book is a wonderful idea. Gather recipes from family and friends, or include the couple’s favorite dishes and give them a beautifully bound cookbook. The book could also include blank pages for them to fill in with their own culinary creations over the years. Cooking together is an intimate and fun activity for couples, and having a personalized recipe book adds a special touch to those moments.

**6. Adventure Journal**

Another meaningful gift for newlyweds is an adventure journal. A beautifully designed journal provides the couple with the opportunity to record their travel memories, weekend getaways, and adventures together. You can personalize the cover with their names and wedding date to make it extra special. It’s the perfect way to document all the milestones and adventures in their journey as a married couple. With an adventure journal, they can look back at their travels and memories for years to come.

**7. Customized Star Map**

A customized star map is an incredibly romantic gift that will touch the couple's hearts. You can create a star map of the night sky from a significant date, such as the night they first met, got engaged, or the night of their wedding. It’s a beautiful way to preserve that special moment in time. Star maps are perfect for displaying in their home, reminding them of a moment that changed their lives forever. It’s a sentimental and unique gift that’s sure to be cherished.

**8. Couples’ Massage Kit**

Starting a new life together often means juggling new responsibilities, and a couples’ massage kit is a thoughtful way to help them relax.

It’s a perfect excuse for the couple to take time out from their busy schedules to unwind and reconnect. Add a cozy bathrobe set for each partner, and you have the ultimate relaxation gift that’s sure to be enjoyed.

**9. Personalized Board Game**

Board games can bring lots of fun to any relationship, especially if they’re designed specifically for the couple. A personalized board game with trivia questions about their relationship, inside jokes, and memories can be a fantastic way for the newlyweds to relive their journey together. They’ll enjoy playing it for years to come, and it will always remind them of their wedding day. It’s the perfect way to combine entertainment with romance, creating special moments in their married life.

**10. Gift Card for a Romantic Getaway**

Sometimes, the best gift is one that helps the couple plan something exciting on their own terms. A gift card for a romantic getaway allows the newlyweds to choose the destination and dates that work best for them. Whether it’s a weekend cabin trip, a luxury hotel stay, or a scenic beach escape, giving them the flexibility to plan their dream getaway is a wonderful way to contribute to their new adventure as a married couple.

**11. Memory Box with Special Keepsakes**

A memory box is a heartfelt gift where the couple can store their treasured keepsakes from their wedding day and beyond. You can create a customized memory box with their names, wedding date, and some personalized touches such as a heartfelt letter or a small trinket that holds significance. Over the years, they can add keepsakes like photos, travel souvenirs, and other memorable items that tell the story of their journey together.

**12. Customized Wine or Whiskey Set**

If the couple enjoys a glass of wine or whiskey, gifting them a personalized set is a classy and thoughtful option. You can have their names engraved on wine glasses, whiskey tumblers, or even the bottle itself. Some companies even offer custom labels for the bottle, which can be personalized with the couple’s names and wedding date. This gift is a great way to help them toast to their future together.

**13. Handwritten Vows Print**

Many couples spend hours crafting the perfect vows for their big day, and a handwritten vows print is a beautiful way to preserve those words. You can have their vows turned into a piece of wall art that they can display in their home. It’s a touching reminder of the promises they made to each other and will serve as a daily reminder of their love.

**14. Gardening Kit for Two**

Gardening is a rewarding activity that many couples enjoy, and gifting them a gardening kit for two is a great way to encourage this hobby.

He likes being a barista, but told me early on that he was burnt out and wants to try nursing school. He didn’t take any steps towards that so I asked him how I could help. He said I could research some stuff about local programs and discuss it with him. I did. Well, about a month and a half ago, he tells me he received an offer for a shift lead position at the coffee shop and said if he took it, he’s worried he’d like it too much and not go to nursing school. He accepted it and has been subtly hinting at not going, and said that he’s “just felt pressured to go to nursing school,” though not necessarily by me. His promotion has come with shifts extended by an hour, but I only have so much free time and when he gets off at 8, I can only spend so much time before I have to get ready for school/work the next day. When he has an early morning shift, he can’t do anything the night before. But when he doesn’t have an early morning shift, he wants to stay up late and I can’t do that. 
Additionally, when we began dating, he didn’t vape. But I was away for the first few months for a clerkship (we would see each other about every 3 weeks), and on a visit around 3 months in, I found a vape. It caught me off guard and so I asked. He explained it’s an old habit that he picked back up and he wants to quit. I kind of shrugged it off because I hadn’t known him to vape and figured it was a one time thing. I was wrong. We are into month 6 and I’ve expressed that it bothers me, but he hasn’t stopped. He says he wants to and that this is his last, and all statements of the like. But he still uses it, just secretly. I can taste it when we kiss. It just really frustrates me, and ive realized it’s a non-negotiable. 

I love him and don’t want to see this relationship end, at least permanently, but I don’t know what to do. I feel like so much has changed in his vision(s) that I don’t know if we are aligned anymore. 
Do I proceed by breaking up or asking for some time? Or do I just roll with all of this? Really, any and all advice is appreciated. I don’t ever want to be the partner that is controlling or anything, but I also have to enforce boundaries that I have. ",1,1729946362.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

I can't decide whether spliting from my fiance is a good idea or something I'll come to regret.

I met him whilst I was a student at college. At this time I lived with my mother, and I had a hobby I loved- belly dancing. My mother used to come with me and watch me perform I now live with my fiance and he has banned me from dancing as he said he's jealous. This has made me feel so upset, I really really want to do it again.

My fiance has his own flat and we live together. The area that we're living in isn't the best. I have since started working after college. I've failed my driving test and waiting for another , in the mean time I'm taking the bus. I'm having to walk through this bad part of town at dark hours, there have been multiple stabbings here. On top of this the commute is 4 hours a day. I'm starting to feel fat and losing my body as I have no time to exercise except if I can muster energy up at the weekends. Im also too tired to cook every week, so we're relying on convenience food. I'm just trying to say that this is adding to my stress. He's also gone away this weekend to visit his friend, and next week he's going abroad to visit family, and with me out the house for so many hours on the week days and not being able to see him that much, I feel down.

My fiance has a relatively high paying job, and the goal is to move abroad in a few years. We both want to do that. So, I have a possible future with my fiance and I feel stable. He wants to get married, and wants children, which are my life goals too.

I find that my fiance often makes me nervous, like if we're going out togethor and someone were for instance to take our parking spot that we were about to drive into, he'll get mad and it gives me anxiety. This happens in quite a few scenarios that crops up in daily life. Hell go on to dislike the person who he feels has wronged him ( even if someone was in the right). I find that sometimes he lacks a masculine energy that I crave. 

I find that he also isn't great socially, and doesn't know how to remain friendly with people, even if it involves pretending. There was an incident between him and one of his coworkers and this involved her getting mad at him at a works party we attended, with her insisting he apologise. Ever since then he tells me of the little games that are played whenever they see eachother, e.g trying to take other people that they are both talking to off eachother. He told me at work he was watching another coworkers presentation and at the end didn't clap becuase he felt down and didn't like the person presenting. He's also spoken badly about other coworkers to coworkers he's friendly with, these conversations have been over text where he's called them names like 'cow, b*tch'. If he's speaking one on one to someone he's ok, but pretending to like people for the sake of getting on isn't something he does, and I'm finding he makes enemies. He can be a little pushy with people too. I don't think people find him very likeable.

I find him to do small things that are selfish at times in our day to day life, and he is often asking me to make him a cup of coffee whilst we're both sat on the sofa.

Having said all of this, my fiance is good to me. He cares about me, he takes me in his car to work if he can, he helps me with important paperwork e.g related to work, he's recently made an effort to do more house work as he knows how tired I get. So in a lot of ways, it's hard to fault him. I feel comfortable with him and he's a nice guy. 

So, I'm not sure whether leaving would be the best thing, or whether I'd be making a huge mistake. I'm 24 so I'm not that young anymore. Any advice I'd appreciate ",5,1729946345.0,RedPillWomen,8,0.86,False

About an hour later, we're getting more drunk, the party is winding down, and I ask again if she wants to leave, and she says no again.

 I saw true beauty in her. How she was graciously resting beside a window, how she os comfortable and effortlessly pretty, her fragile hands, her dark black hair...i was imagining how she would smell and how pretty she would be smiling. I was wondering what kind of person she would be, her personality, her interests, types of music she would listen, types of books she would read. What would it like be to love her, care for her.

Today, it's got worse again, and I just passed a clot almost the size of the bottom of a coffee mug/cup. I've had a nagging ache in my lower back all morning, gradually getting worse.

I can't imagine the bleeding is my period, as I've been in chemical menopause for 6 months and a new jab wouldn't have been due until 4 November I'd I'd have carried on (obviously stopped now due to surgery).

Woman came up behind me, and had misjudged how far she had to move forward, resulting in her blocking the junction (Criss cross lines).

Having people to chat with throughout the day, share memes, discuss serious and unserious topics and even dare I say...parallel play would be great. Currently I'm job hunting after completely internship as a web developer, it's been a great experience and I'm excited to move forward. At the same time trying to broaden my horizons and develop a broader interest in computer science as well since I've been mostly just learning wev dev stuff. For anyone in a similar field I'd be happy to exchange stories and experiences and maybe you could help me finally decide on a couple of projects to work on, but no pressure.

Huge fan of most From Soft games in general, albeit I've yet to play demon souls and armored core. Some other favorite games include Dragon Age, The Witcher (surprisingly all 3), Divinity Original Sin II, Dragon's Dogma, Valheim,  Detroit: Become Human, Horizon Zero Dawn, Stardew Valley God of War. This went on for longer than I'd have liked so let's get back to books for a bit. I'm mostly into fantasy, and history but have also been delving into Japanese Authors over this past year and it's been great. Furthermore I listen to music a lot and would be down to share recommendations and playlists! Granted I've been listening mostly to game osts, pop and kpop but totally down to try something new. Also a fan of shows anime and impatiently waiting for the next episode of re:zero with excitement, finjdhed Love Next Door on netlfix and loved it a lot. Unsurprisingly I read manga as well and am still trying to decide on how I feel about jjk's ending. I feel that I've rambled for long enough so I'll cut this short by mentioning I love animals and would be very happy to see your pets! Thanks for reading!",0,1729944965.0,Needafriend,1,0.5,False

1gcjpvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1gcjpvd/sudden_left_vision_loss/,Sudden left vision loss,"Hello guys, yesterday I was with my family and as I was walking up and down the stairs I was having trouble seeing clearly so I close my eye and open it to find I lost my vision on the left side completely. I was rushed to the emergency and within about an hour my vision came back slowly. I’m 30 years old no history of such a thing in our family my body weight/fat/muscle measurements are normal based on couple of smart scales.

I have been checked for:
- Measurement of Creatinine (Normal)
- ECG (Normal)
- Computerized Tomography of Brain (Normal)
- Spiral Angiography (My insurance won’t approve it yet)

Last thing I did before I lost my vision temporarily eating some chocolate and sweet with drinking coffee.

I’m smoker (Cigarettes, tobacco pipe, weed sometimes) I get stressed and worried occasionally and I was very depressed for a while but that was years ago, I mellowed some in last couple years but I get worried about work, health, relationship every now and then.

I don’t know what to expect or how to cope with this situation now any advice is appreciated. I met with two doctors one of them told me I have TIA and the second in bigger hospital waiting for me to do Spiral Angiography but I can’t pay for it for now I’m trying today again to get it approved by the insurance.

I followed link for updating my voter registration but everything I’m seeing is to apply to register to vote, not to update your voter registration. 

Can I just vote under my old last name? All other info is correct, it’s just the last name that is wrong. 

If I can’t do this, HOW do I update it? Maybe it’s because I haven’t finished my coffee yet but I can’t find any links that lead me to a site to *update* my registration, only to actually register. 

Today is the deadline to register or make changes so I need to do this ASAP. I didn’t bother checking until just now bc I know I’m registered, just didn’t realize I never updated my name. 

PS- make sure you’re registered and go vote!!",1,1729944750.0,AskNYC,2,1.0,False

I don’t drink juice/soda and sticking to water when I can taste something better it’s always impossible. I can only go to cafeterias where I peacefully drink coffee without struggling. Even when I go to a gas station I must avoid looking at the drinks cause if I see beer there’s a high chance I’ll take one, or an energy drink and that’s still terrible, when I go to the supermarket I must avoid going to the liquors too. The only way I can stop worrying about drinking is staying at home",6,1729944620.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False
1gcjmf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1gcjmf2/getting_around_northern_italy/,Getting around Northern Italy,"Buongiorno!

  
My partner and I are going to be in Italy mid November- mid December. We are flying into Naples. We had originally planned to spend some time in the Puglia area, but are leaning towards going full wintery vibes and heading north.

  
We don't have a big budget, 125-150 euro a day. We intend to travel slow. Stay in a place for a week or so, taking side quests and then basing somewhere else for a week or so, until our month is over. 

  
We considered taking a train from Naples to Bologna, renting a car there and exploring the Emilia Romagna region (Parma, Modena, Ravenna etc) 

  
Verona looks like maybe another good place for a base. We have heard good tings about the lakes ( Lago di Garda, Lago di Como)

  
But again we aren't the type staying in fancy hotels, more like a room in someones house thought aribnb or booking...

Also have heard good tings about the Turin area..

  
We would love to have access to some Christmas markets, and just lay low. We aren't really ""vacationing"" just want to stay places we can enjoy slow days, having some coffee, reading, visiting some small towns, and grabbing a bite out to eat here and there ( we are both big foodies, love to cook and eat new foods)

  
Any insight on these plans given the information I provided would be much appreciated!

  
Thanks
