I joined this company a couple of months ago, and soon after I joined I realized that my boss is one is this tyrant with great insecurities. The moment I’d step down for a coffee, he’d immediately call and ask where I was and who I was with. If I would speak to my colleagues, he would text me at the side taking a stock of all tasks, and tell me I shouldn’t be joking around with colleagues. If I’d be listening to music while getting locked into my tasks on my headphones, he’d be like I want to ban headphones in the office. He’d respond to every text from the WA group on private message and ask me to show him all messages before sending them - same goes with emails. If I am speaking to a third party to close a deal, he would be like use your female charm to woo him - you are a woman, he will give you what you want. He would constantly take a dig at my religion despite me saying I am not comfortable. He would talk about women in the most cheap and derogatory way. He would always turn down ideas, and when would see a competitor doing that later, he’d come back and tell me we should be doing that. He would use money from other artist’s kitty to favour another artist without telling them - purely illegal. He was in touch with multiple vendors to ‘buy’ streams for the songs - purely illegal again. He favoured artists that he had personal relationships with and kept even the most talented ones on the sidelines.

I had had it with him, made a list of these things and took it to his boss after my performance evaluation was done. My performance review was excellent because I had exceeded all my targets, and he announced my confirmation in front of the other colleagues verbally. When I went to our head office, I then put forth the complaints. I was assured that this will be taken very seriously. When I came back, they had a meeting with the HR, my boss, and his boss to tell me that I am being put back on probation.

He kept up with this harassment, and I was absolutely standing my ground there. After 3 months they decided to fire me and give me 3 months salary only if I sign a paper that says that I am resigning voluntarily, I will not speak about what happened in a public platform, I shall not go to the press. Only if I sign it will I get my FnF.

Now, I anyway wanted to resign at the 3 monthly check in meeting. I don’t want to be working there. But my question is what are my rights here and should I be signing it? After months of harassment and now this, I think I am entitled to a greater compensation. Would really appreciate some advice.",1,1762402349.0,LegalAdviceIndia,0,1.0,False

Lebanese Architect Marc Dibeh Reconfigures a 1970s Office Into a Sculptural Home in Beirut
The AD100 designer has transformed a former office in the city’s Verdun neighbourhood into a calm, considered home

In an era where many designers are concentrating more on content creation than creating great work, Lebanese architect Marc Dibeh is letting his projects speak for themselves – and his latest is a total wow. Since opening his eponymous studio in 2009, the Beirut-based AD100 designer has developed a body of work that speaks with increasing clarity, and this private apartment in Beirut’s Verdun district balances restraint and sensual materiality with his usual aplomb.



Lebanese Architect Marc Dibeh Reconfigures a 1970s Office Into a Sculptural Home in Beirut
Occupying 350 square metres in a former 1970s office building, the serene residence is the result of a full architectural reimagining with Dibeh deconstructing and reassembling the original rigid floor plan. The structural intervention allowed the team to create a layered home, one composed of sculptural volumes and subtle transitions where all the memories of typewriter pools and office cubicles have been fully banished.


“It began with understanding the limitations of the space – the load-bearing walls, the fragmentation,” Dibeh explains. “Instead of forcing openness, we allowed the architecture to guide us.” The most dramatic gesture came in the reception area, where a former mezzanine was partially removed to create soaring double-height volume. The remaining portion became a connector to the master suite, suspended above the main living area like a floating corridor, catwalk-like in its appearance.



Below the walkway, a sweeping custom bouclé sofa curves across the travertine floor, softening the space but giving structure to the room. This anchoring gesture is flanked by vertical blackened steel balustrades above and inlaid stone underfoot; the multiple tonal variations in the travertine setting the ambiance from the ground up. Aside from the geometric inlays, it forms the surfaces of built-ins, and sweeps up walls, its hues subtly changing as the light shifts through the day; “it’s almost an excessive use of travertine”, laughs Dibbeh. From this foundation, a muted palette of pale putties and soft greens is enlivened with jolts of turmeric, saffron, walnut wood and brushed brass. “I wanted to create a rhythm in the materials, to set the mood and add some decorative moments without it being overdone,” adds Dibeh.


Decorative flourishes ensure that while the apartment is pared back, there’s enough interest to stop it feeling sterile: a red horn speaker – chosen by the music-obsessed client – is echoed by seating in a vibrant fabric; a single ceramic vessel commands attention, and travertine planter outside has been recessed into glass windows on three sides, creating an indoor-outdoor connection.



There’s a more striking example of this sentiment immediately upon entering the apartment. “We saw the entrance as a kind of clearing,” the Lebanese architect explains, “almost like an open courtyard in a forest. There’s a tree at the centre, and it can shift from a moment of solitude to a place for gathering.”






That duality continues in the living area, which, while grand in scale, includes small pockets of intimacy such as a study tucked into a corridor, and a reading nook perched beneath the suspended walkway. With Dibbeh’s studio creating bespoke furniture for the apartment, it ensured that the elegant design was also suitable for daily life, albeit a very elevated one. Sculptural coffee tables, deep armchairs, a bar with clean lines and a monolithic dining table are all designed for friends to gather and engage, a passion of the client.



The apartment also includes three bedrooms, a kitchen, a family lounge and a dining room. Each zone is connected through subtle repetition; finishes remain consistent and built-in shelves line transitional spaces, creating natural connections that take guests from room to room. For Dibeh, the most meaningful parts of the project lie in the details. “The inlays in the stone, the proportions of a doorframe, the weight of a drawer handle – these things carry the emotion of the work,” he says. “They’re subtle, but they stay with you.”

Here's the chain of events:

* Thursday: My wife was out running errands and the car didn't start after stopping to pick up a coffee. I drove out saw the car was completely dead (no dash lights or power anything). I pulled the battery, brought it home, and charged it. I went back out and reinstalled the battery the van started right up. I chocked it up to a lot of on/off driving not fully charging the battery. Note this battery is only 8 months old.
* Saturday: Once again my wife was out running errands and again it didn't start after about an hour being turned off. I did the same thing as before: pulled battery, charged it, reinstalled and the car started.
* I assumed it must be the alternator not charging the battery, but I ran a diagnostic with my battery charger on the alternator and it came up as working. Also, while driving the car, the info on the dash also shows 13.7-13.8 V of charge going across the battery. So the alternator doesn't seem like the problem source.
* I started looking for parasitic draws by connecting my multimeter in series between the negative post on the battery and the negative connector. I was reading 40mA which the internet says is an acceptable draw. I did have a bluetooth OBD2 reader connected the entire time up until now. When I disconnected that, the parasitic draw fell to 10mA. So I kept it disconnected and hoped that would solve my problem.
* I have been paranoid about the battery failing again, so I did fully charge the battery each night on Monday and Tuesday.
* Today (Wednesday): My wife tried to start the car in the garage in the afternoon (it had already worked a few times that day) and it just kind of flashed oddly at her and didn't turn over. When I went to look at it, it also oddly swapped into run mode without turning over at first, but then I was able to get it started without doing anything else. I turned it off and poked around the car a bit. Then I turned it back on and took it for a ride to get gas as it was running pretty low. After filling up, the car once again started without issue. Not entirely sure what to make of that ordeal.
* One other post mentioned that firmly re-seating all of the fuses can ""remedy a lot of electrical gremlins"". I just tried that and a few of them did slightly budge, but I'm not holding my breath that that actually did anything.

At this point, I'm not really convinced that the battery was actually low either of the times I pulled/charged it. In my experience, when a battery has gone bad, it fails overnight, not in the middle of the day. It seems like there might be some electrical ghost, and I kind of think the first two times the problem may have been solved just by disconnecting/reconnecting the battery.

My only other thought is to take the car to Autozone and have them check the cold cranking amps of the battery. Seems like a longshot, so I wanted to also come here to see if anyone has any other suggestions because I'm just about at a loss. And I just don't have any faith in the van's reliability at this point.

Any suggestions are appreciated!",1,1762402031.0,ChryslerPacifica,2,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Europa League: Salzburg vs. Go Ahead Eagles – The Ultimate Same-Game Parlay Play**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of Austrian efficiency and Dutch… *enthusiasm*. On Thursday, Salzburg (the Bundesliga’s answer to a Swiss Army knife) hosts Go Ahead Eagles (the Netherlands’ most creatively named football club since “De Graafschap” tried to trademark “Dutch Courage”). Let’s parse the odds, digest the (fabricated but plausible) news, and find the parlay that’ll make your wallet do the cha-cha.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Who’s the Real Deal?

The numbers scream **Salzburg dominance**. On FanDuel, the Austrians are a rock-solid **-157** (implied probability: 61.5%) to win, while Go Ahead Eagles hover at **+500** (16.7%), with a draw at **+400** (20%). DraftKings and Bovada back Salzburg at **-165 to -178** (59.7%–56.8%), reinforcing their status as favorites.

But here’s the kicker: the **totals line** is a goldmine. Bovada and LowVig.ag list **Over 3.0 goals at +125** (45.5% implied), while Under is a steep **-150** (60%). Meanwhile, FanDuel’s **Over 3.5 goals** sits at **+200** (33.3%), a tempting high-risk/high-reward angle. Salzburg’s attack is a well-oiled machine (14 goals in their last five Europa League games), and Go Ahead’s defense? Let’s just say their backline looks like a sieve that’s been upgraded to a colander.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and a Shoelace Incident

* **Salzburg**: Their star striker, **Firmino Lucas**, is “resting” after a mysterious incident involving a coffee machine and a 12-hour nap. The team’s official statement: “He’s fine. Probably.” Their midfield, however, is as reliable as a Swiss watch—no surprises there.
* **Go Ahead Eagles**: Their captain, **Lennart de Geus**, is “day-to-day” after tripping over his own shoelaces during a pre-match press conference. The team’s new “dancing warm-up routine” ha

1opozkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/1opozkh/au_story_the_violet_knight_part_13/,AU Story: The Violet Knight Part 13,"A week later, Team Emerald was on high alert, already utilizing their new assets. Ellie & Mia were in the Batmobile and were chasing a target through the skyscraper canyons of Gotham. The target was a woman encased in bulky, bright pink and blue armor who was flying dangerously low over the city, shooting plasma bursts wildly.

​“Who is this, Alfred?” Ellie called over the comms, dodging a blast that melted a streetlamp.

​From the opposite direction, the black and red Ford Mustang GTD roared into the fight, driven by Damian.

​“We’ll find out,” Damian replied tersely, his driving precise as he swerved around traffic and began cutting off the flyer’s escape routes.

​The armored woman pivoted, now firing concentrated bursts at both high-performance vehicles. The battle was chaotic, but coordinated.
​Then, from above, Rachel and Tara, flying in a synchronized strike, hit the armored woman with a powerful dual-blast of energy and kinetic force, knocking her out of the sky and sending her spiraling toward a rooftop.

​Before she could hit the ground, Mia popped her head out of the Batmobile’s passenger side window and fired a net arrow, which deployed instantly, capturing the armored woman in a durable, power-dampening mesh.
​The Emerald 5 quickly exited their vehicles and walked toward the struggling, trapped figure. The woman was yelling aggressively in rapid Japanese.

​At the Gotham Police Department, the five heroes stood outside the observation window of the interrogation room, listening to the woman continue to yell in Japanese. Commissioner James Gordon stood nearby.

​“I’ve seen that armor before,” Ellie stated, her eyes narrowed.

​“You have?” Gordon asked.

​Ellie tapped her gauntlet and projected a side-by-side holographic display on the observation window. 
On one side was the captured woman in the pink and blue suit; on the other, a file photo of a man wearing a nearly identical silver and black version of the armor.

​“Saico-Tek,” Ellie answered, her voice cold. “That’s what the man who wore that armor called himself years ago when he fought Raven and the other four original Titans. They were in Japan.”

​Rachel nodded, recognition dawning in her eyes. “Now I remember that armor. Saico-Tek is an assassin for a powerful Japanese yakuza-type group called Nuvia.”

​Damian, his back ramrod straight, added a chilling piece of history. “I’ve heard stories. Ra’s Al Ghul’s group spent decades fighting them for influence in East Asia. They are ruthless.”

​Mia cracked her knuckles. “Alright. Let’s find out why she came all the way from the other side of the world to Gotham.” She pushed open the door and entered the interrogation room.

​The Saico-Tek woman instantly stopped speaking Japanese and began to yell in perfect, rage-filled English: “I will kill all of you! The League’s stench must be purged!”

​Mia walked right up to the table and, with a vicious pull, ripped the helmet off the woman, revealing a furious face and long black hair. “Talk. Why did you come here?”

​The assassin smirked. “For the boy.”
​Damian immediately entered the room, his eyes twin points of green fire. “So those stories are correct. Nuvia did fight the League of Assassins.”

​The assassin laughed, a harsh, grating sound. “Correct, boy. The League’s stench is all over you. Nuvia will be the best assassin group left standing.”

​Ellie, Rachel, and Tara entered the room behind Damian.
​“Why are you wearing Saico-Tek’s armor? Did you kill the guy?” Tara asked, ever direct.

​“There are many that wear the armor, just like how many in the League wear their uniform,” the assassin stated with pride.

​Ellie smirked, pulling up the woman's official background on her gauntlet. “Mai Ezo.”

​Mai’s face instantly contorted with fury. “Shut up!” she screamed.

​“Ooh, hate your real name, Mai?” Mia said teasingly.

​Damian completed the thought. “Let me guess: you were told to never use your real names, completely drop your connection to the world, and be just a mindless soldier.”

​“That is required,” Mai spat.

​Ellie closed the file on her gauntlet, the image of Mai Ezo vanishing. She looked at her team, a dangerous determination in her eyes. “Well, looks like we’re going to Japan.”

The main screen in the Batcave glowed, displaying a video feed of two key figures: Victor and Kori, who offered a warm, but concerned, presence. ​Ellie stood at the center console, flanked by Mia and Tara. Rachel sat quietly, absorbing the gravity of the situation, while Damian prowled near the back, pulling up encrypted League of Assassins scrolls onto a side monitor.

​“Alright, Victor, Kori, thanks for taking this call so fast,” Ellie began, professional and clipped. “We confirmed the assassin is part of the Nuvia organization, connected to the Saico-Tek armor. We need everything you have on them.”

​Victor, his massive form filling his portion of the screen, nodded grimly. “Ellie, look. We ran the data, this isn’t just local crime. Nuvia is a shadow conglomerate, part yakuza, part global assassination syndicate. They specifically focus on eliminating rivals who challenge their control over Asian corporate and military sectors.”

​Kori leaned forward, her expression serious. “They are masters of stealth and infiltration. When they attacked us years ago, they came with absolute commitment to the kill. It was one of the most difficult battles we faced because they utilized advanced tech that disrupted our abilities.”

​“Specifically my empathic senses,” Rachel added softly, meeting Kori’s gaze through the screen. “Their armor emits a low-frequency static that dampens psionic and empathic influence. They were the first enemies that made me feel completely deaf.”

​Damian, without turning from his scroll, chimed in, his voice cold. “Ra’s al Ghul considered them a perennial threat. They use ideology and training similar to the League, but substitute our mystical resources with advanced, disposable technology. They see the League as an archaic tradition. Mai Ezo was likely sent as a message: to eliminate the newest heir and discredit our strength.”

​Mia tapped her fingers on the console. “Okay, so they’re better-funded and use psychic-jamming gear. What about Mai Ezo? Is she talking?”

​“She’s still spewing Nuvia propaganda in the GCPD holding cells,” Ellie answered, pulling up Mai’s vital signs. “The only thing we got was her real name, Mai Ezo, which she was furious about. Damian confirmed their doctrine is to abandon all personal identity.”

​Tara looked at the others, tactical as always. “Mai flew across the globe for a hit on Damian. They aren't going to stop after one failure. They're going to send more, probably bigger.”

​“Which is why we’re changing the playbook,” Ellie declared, looking directly at Victor. “We are not waiting for them to bring the fight to Gotham. We’re taking Mai’s arrest as our invasion flag. We are going to Japan.”

​Victor hesitated for a moment, then gave a firm nod. “Bold. I like it. I’ll upload everything we have on Saico-Tek’s armor specifications and known Nuvia corporate fronts to your Bat-gauntlets right now. Kori and I will handle League and Justice League approval for a global operation. You have twenty-four hours to prep. Do not engage unless absolutely necessary, and stick to non-lethal protocol, Damian.”

​Damian smirked, finally turning around. “Understood, Victor. Non-lethal force is noted.”

​Kori smiled gently. “Ellie, Mia, Rachel, Tara… be safe. We are all proud of the team you have become.”

​The screen went dark.
​Ellie turned to her team, a dangerous excitement in her eyes. “Alright, Team Emerald. First global mission. Operation: Tokyo Tango is a go.”

Later that afternoon, Ellie was in her room, methodically packing her new stealth suit, utility belt components, and non-lethal Japanese-specific gear into a specialized trunk. Duke, her puppy, was tumbling happily at her feet, attempting to ""help"" by chewing on a discarded piece of foam.

​Suddenly, a flash of white light erupted near the closet, and Sara Lance materialized, dressed in comfortable athleisure wear.
​Ellie smiled, not looking up as she packed a small canister of knockout gas. “Well, look who it is, Duke, it's Grandma.”

​Sara rolled her eyes, stepping around a pile of socks. “I am not a grandma, Cubbie.”

​Ellie looked up, feigning innocence. “Oh? So if Gar and I were having a baby, you would be upset? You wouldn’t want a tiny Legend-Bat-Beast-Boy running around?”

​Sara put a hand to her forehead, a dramatic sigh escaping her lips. ""I don't like being called Grandma; it makes me feel older than 40. God, I'm 40 now.""

​Ellie abandoned her packing and walked over, giving her mom a quick side hug. “You still look hot, Mom. Promise.”

​Sara chuckled, pushing her daughter back gently. “Thanks for the compliment.” Then her face went serious, her eyes locking onto Ellie's stomach. “Wait! You’re not actually pregnant, right? Don't play games with me.”

​Ellie shrugged, maintaining her playful smirk. “Maybe, maybe not. Who's to say?”

​Sara’s voice dropped, firm and serious, the sound of a mother who had faced down armies and yet found this fear terrifying. “Helena Wayne, tell me if you are, because you are not fighting assassins while pregnant!”

​Ellie immediately dropped the teasing. She put both hands on her mother's shoulders, her expression now full of love and understanding. “I’m just joking, Mom. If I was, I wouldn’t be packing. I’m not that stubborn about going on a mission.”

​Sara pulled her daughter into a fierce, protective hug. “Please never joke about that again, Cubbie. I’m serious.”

​Ellie hugged her back tightly. “I won’t. I love you.”

​“I love you too, Cubbie. Now go, pack those non-lethals, and try not to start an international incident.”

​Damian, who had been walking down the hall, heard the conversation. He stopped outside Ellie's partially open door, watching the intense moment of vulnerability and unconditional affection between the two women.

​He watched the hug, the relief on Sara’s face, and the instant compliance from Ellie once her mother’s genuine fear was revealed. He processed the pure, non-transactional nature of their bond.

Sara was kneeling on the floor of Ellie’s room, helping her zip up the compartment containing her non-lethal sonic emitters. Duke, was rolling around joyfully on the blanket, completely oblivious to the high stakes of his owner's profession.
​
Ellie mused aloud, folding a spare uniform. “Thinking about it, me and Mia would have two potentially interesting pregnancies, wouldn’t we? I would be carrying a baby that’s 50% Beast Boy, and she would be carrying a baby that’s 25% Kryptonian.”

​Sara stood up, pushing a stray lock of hair back. “That is an interesting statistic, Cubbie, terrifying, too.”

​“And I’m not going to be a mother at 18, so you can relax,” Mia announced, walking in with a duffle bag over her shoulder and a small suitcase in the other hand. She watched happily as Koda trotted over and immediately engaged Duke in a chaotic puppy wrestling match. 

“Sunshine and I are making sure of that.”

​“Good!” Sara sighed in relief. “Felicity is already having an anxiety attack over the knowledge you and Jon are ‘doing it.’ I wouldn’t want to imagine if she found out you were pregnant.”

​“BatBeast and SuperArrow,” Ellie summarized with a grin. “Two hormonal couples, ready to confuse the universe.”

​Mia walked toward them, her face lighting up. “Speaking of Sunshine, he showed me the Fortress after we got the puppies.”

​“He did?” Sara asked, a genuine smile replacing her tension.

​Mia got giddy. “Yes. We talked to the AI versions of Jor-El and Lara.”

​“A major step,” Ellie said, bumping Mia’s shoulder. “That means he loves you a lot.”

​“I know, right?” Mia confirmed. “Actually, Sunshine showed me the Fortress before I even had dinner with his parents.”

​Sara’s eyebrows shot up. “Wait, really?”

​Ellie gave her mother a meaningful look. “We were grounded for two months.”

​“Because you went behind the League’s back and got nearly destroyed, that’s why you have a bio-synthetic hand, Mia,” Sara said, her voice firm, acknowledging the cost of their recklessness. 

“Trust me, I know.” said Ellie.

​“Trust me, I know, too,” Mia agreed, looking down at her sleek, articulated hand.

​Ellie changed the subject back to the present. “Can you make sure the rest of the Legends take good care of the puppies and the city while we’re gone, Mom?”

​“Of course, Cubbie. We will do our best,” Sara promised.

​Ellie and Mia wrapped Sara in a final hug, soaking up the last few moments of family connection. The final goodbyes were exchanged with Rachel, Tara, and Damian, who were waiting by the back entrance. Then they left the Manor and boarded a private plane bound for Japan, ready to tackle the growing threat of Nuvia.

Ellie was curled up against the window, watching the distant pinpricks of light that marked civilization.
​""Yeah, just turbulence, BB,"" Ellie whispered into her phone, a soft smile on her face. ""You sound like you're tracking me on three different satellites right now.""

​On the other end, Gar sighed dramatically. “How can I not worry? You’re flying halfway across the world to fight ninja Yakuza assassins, El. And you have Damian Wayne with you. I still feel bad I missed his grand entrance.”

​""He’s fine. He’s asleep right now, actually,"" Ellie reassured him, glancing over at her brother. ""Look, I have four of the deadliest people on the planet with me. Mia has her shiny new non-lethal hand, Rachel and Tara are flying security, and Damian has already agreed to the 'no killing' rule.""

​“You just stick to the grappling hooks, Bat-dork, please.” Gar pleaded.

​""Promise. Just hurry home, okay? I miss sleeping next to my Beast."" Ellie smiled.

​“I miss you too. I’ll be waiting for you, always. Now, go save Japan. I love you.” smiled Gar.

​“I love you too, Gar.” Ellie blew a kiss into the phone and gently ended the call, her heart feeling a little lighter.

​Mia was looking intently at her phone screen, her conversation with Jonathan more subdued but equally intense.

​""It still feels crazy we were standing in the Fortress a few days ago,"" Mia murmured, rubbing the polished synthetic skin of her new hand. ""You let me see your whole heart, Jon, and now I'm flying away for a week.""

​“That’s why I took you there,” Jon's earnest voice came through the speaker. “It’s the only place I wanted to take you after everything that happened. You needed to know you have a home with me, too. And you do. You are my home, Mia.”

​Mia’s eyes softened, and she giggled quietly. ""God, you're sweet, Sunshine. You know, I've had more romantic grand gestures in the last two months than I had in the rest of my life combined. Fortress of Solitude, puppies, new cars...""

​“I’ll buy you a space puppy next time,” Jon joked, though there was an underlying tension. “Just be careful. That Nuvia group sounds dangerous, especially with their links to the League. Promise me you’ll stick with Rachel and Tara?”
​
""I promise. We stick together. We're a five-unit package now, and we're bringing Damian back alive and non-lethal,"" Mia assured him. ""I'll be back soon, Sunshine. Gotta make those Kent dinners eventually, and I need to teach Koda how to fetch an asteroid.""

​“Be safe. I love you.” said Jon

​“I love you too, Jon.” said Mia.

​Mia ended the call, meeting Ellie’s gaze across the cabin. They didn't need words. With a shared nod, they settled back into their seats, falling asleep.

In a discreet, hidden base carved beneath the bustling lights of Tokyo, the leader of Nuvia, an old and formidable Asian man named Daizo, sat behind a low mahogany desk. The room was traditional, bamboo accents, shadowed corners but filled with humming computer screens.

​“They’re coming,” Daizo said, taking a slow sip of whiskey from a thick glass. He looked up at his guest.

​“Like I told you they would, Daizo,” Talia al Ghul replied, sitting across from him. She was impeccably dressed, her posture radiating confidence even in the heart of an enemy organization’s lair. “When those young heroes arrive, we will take care of the girls, and Damian will join us.”

​Daizo swirled the amber liquid in his glass, his eyes narrowed with suspicion. “From what you told me about your League, your father, and yourself, you taught Damian to never betray blood. He has only just bonded with his half-blooded sister, Helena Wayne.” Daizo leaned forward, his voice a low growl. “How do you know he will betray his sister for you?”
​
Talia’s smirk was lethal, an expression of absolute certainty. She placed her chin in her hand, utterly comfortable in her manipulation.
​“Because, Daizo, I am his mother. And he won’t betray me.”

The long flight to Tokyo was smooth and dark. Ellie, Mia, and Tara were all deeply asleep, curled into their seats. The only light in the cabin came from the soft, blue accents of the floor lighting.

​Damian quietly exited the small private jet's bathroom. As he walked past the seating area, he saw Rachel the quietest of them all, covered in a thick blue blanket, her head resting against the bulkhead. She wasn't asleep; her eyes were open, fixed on the darkness outside the window.

​He hesitated only briefly before sitting down in the empty seat next to her, pulling a small section of her blanket over his knees.

​Rachel turned her head slightly and smiled, a rare, genuine expression. “Hey, Damian.”

​Damian didn’t look at her immediately. His posture was still rigid, but his voice was stripped bare of its usual combativeness, reflecting the honesty the darkness allowed.
​“I was thinking,” he began, his gaze fixed on the quiet hum of the engine. “If this mission is a failure, if I am unsuccessful in maintaining my new loyalties, I want you to know something.” He finally looked at her. “I think your beauty is impeccable, and you are a wonderful person to spend time with because we both like silence.”

​The formality of his confession, framing it as a statement of fact tied to a mission outcome, was heartbreakingly perfect.
​
Rachel, who understood unspoken emotions better than anyone, didn’t need complex words. She leaned up toward him, her hands resting gently on his chest.
“I’ve fallen for you as well, Damian,” she whispered, and then she kissed him.

​It was a brief, simple, and profound kiss, a sealing of an unspoken promise between two intense souls who had finally found peace in each other’s quiet company.

The rhythmic, low hum of the private jet was the only sound in the cabin as the sun began to paint the sky a soft, hazy orange over the Pacific. Mia, Ellie, and Tara were all awake, standing over the plush seating area, arms crossed, matching grins plastered across their faces.
​Beneath them, tucked under a thick blue blanket, were Rachel and Damian, sound asleep and cuddled together, Damian’s rigid arm draped carefully over Rachel's shoulder, her head tucked perfectly against his chest.

​“See, I told you,” Mia grinned, whispering triumphantly.

​Ellie quickly lifted her phone, capturing the beautiful, improbable sight of the two intense, silent heroes finally finding peace. “They’re so cute together. This is officially my new wallpaper.”

​Tara, usually stoic, leaned in, her eyes wide with curiosity. “So, what are their ship names going to be? Would they be like RedSapphire? DemonBird? WayneRoth?”

​Ellie shrugged, still smiling. “I don’t know. Something quiet, probably. The Silent Ship.”

​Mia wrapped an arm around Tara’s shoulders, her focus instantly shifting. “Now we need to get you some love, T. Everyone else has a ridiculously intense relationship now.”

​Ellie smirked, leaning closer to include Tara in the conspiracy. “I heard Kori tell me that Atlantis boys are hot.”

​Mia’s eyes sparkled with mischief, instantly turning the conversation into a new travel plan. “Oooh, after we wrap up Nuvia in Japan, next stop: Atlantis.”

​Tara just laughed, a sound full of genuine happiness for her friends, even as a faint blush touched her cheeks at the mention of her own love life, as the sun rose when they reached Tokyo.

A couple days later Team Emerald moved with practiced stealth through the heavily guarded warehouse district of Tokyo. Following the intel provided by Mai Ezo, they located the hidden Nuvia base, a nondescript factory complex. The five heroes infiltrated quickly, moving silently through the shadows in their full hero gear.

​The moment they breached the central command chamber, they were swarmed. Not only by Saico-Tek assassins in pink & blue, silver & black, or gold & black armor, but also by several figures wearing the tell-tale black and red of the League of Assassins.

​“Come out now!!!” Ellie yelled over the din, flipping off a wall to avoid a laser blast.

​Then, the true leaders emerged. Daizo, the old Asian man, walked out from behind a pillar, his eyes burning with ancient calculation. Beside him, serene and utterly cold, was Talia.

​Damian froze mid-strike, his katana halting an inch from a Saico-Tek helmet. “Mother? What are you doing?”

​Talia smirked, unfazed by the chaos. “Building an alliance, Damian. An alliance to control all of East Asia. Nuvia has the infrastructure; the League has the discipline. When these girls are taken care of, you will join us.”

“Shut up you annoying bitch!” Mia yelled.

​Before Talia could reply, the ground shook. A sharp, focused sonic blast slammed into the room, knocking several assassins unconscious. Victor dropped from a massive hole torn in the ceiling, followed instantly by a massive green werewolf Gar, who landed in front of Ellie and let loose a deafening, terrifying roar.

​Then, a bright flash of laser eyes exploded a section of the upper railing as Jonathan floated down, a protective aura surrounding Mia. 
Dick and Kori followed, a flurry of batarangs and starbolts taking out another wave of attackers.

​“I thought this was our mission,” Ellie shouted at the combined force of the Titans and Superboy.

​Victor grinned, his eyes glowing. “Sorry about crashing the party, but we found out that mommy dearest was in bed with the Nuvia snake, so we came to help.”
​
Daizo cursed, pulling a ceremonial sword from his robes. “You didn’t tell me the Arrowgirl was with Superman’s son, Talia!” he snapped at Talia.

​Talia’s attention was fixed only on Jon. She pulled a sleek silver gun with a piece of glowing green Kryptonite fitted into the side. “I can handle him,” she said dismissively.
​Jon’s eyes went wide. “Kryptonite!”

​Talia fired a concentrated blast. Jon flew up and away, dodging the beam, but the threat was real. The fight dissolved into total chaos. Jon focused his laser vision from the ceiling, keeping Talia pinned and dodging her Kryptonite shots while the rest of the Titans and Team Emerald engaged the swarm of assassins.

​The Wayne siblings moved as a unit, forcing Daizo into a defensive dance. The old Nuvia leader was highly skilled, but he was facing two katanas wielded by youth and rage.
​From across the room, Mia saw her chance. Jon was slow after dodging a near-miss. Mia fired a net arrow, not at an assassin, but directly at Talia's hand. The net struck, causing Talia's shot to fly wide, just grazing Jon’s shoulder instead of his chest.

​“Sunshine!” Mia yelled, rushing over to check on him.

​With Talia momentarily distracted, Damian and Ellie abandoned Daizo and converged on Talia while Dick took over fighting Daizo.

​Talia looked at the siblings, her expression hardening. “Damian, you know not to betray blood.”

​Damian’s eyes narrowed, all lingering doubt erased by the sight of her nearly killing his sister’s boyfriend. “You betrayed blood when you got in bed with the snake, Mother! Grandfather would never side with the enemy, and you did just that. He would kill you if he were alive, and I would never betray Ellie.”

​“She’s already warped your mind with her sentimentality,” Talia said coldly, discarding the net.

​“No,” Damian countered, the raw truth cutting through his formal speech. “She’s been showing me the life I would’ve been having if Father knew about me. He would have marched right in and taken me back home to live with him, Alfred, Ellie, and Sara. You didn’t tell him because you knew I would be seen and treated as a person by them, not like the tool you see me as.”

​“Fine then,” Talia snarled, raising the Kryptonite gun again. “You both will die and join your father.”

​The fight between Talia and the two siblings was a violent ballet of highly trained martial arts. The pair, now driven by emotional connection rather than cold discipline, were a better team than she anticipated. As Damian struck high, Ellie swept low. Talia was forced onto the defensive, quickly realizing how outmatched she was by the unified duo.

​Seeing the battle turn, Talia pulled a small, remote device from her belt, pressed a button, and the entire Nuvia base started exploding around them, buying her the distraction she needed to escape into the chaos.
​The fight was over almost as quickly as it started. The Titans and Team Emerald subdued Daizo and the remaining stunned assassins from both factions. As the first Tokyo police sirens wailed in the distance, the police soon arrived and started loading up squad cars.

​Ellie watched as Daizo was secured. She then turned to Damian, who was watching the hole his mother left in the roof. She walked up to him and gave him a tight, thankful side hug.
​Damian’s stiff posture softened. He didn't speak, but a faint, genuine silent grin touched the corner of his mouth. He had chosen his family, and they had chosen him.

The private jet was a haven of quiet luxury after the explosive chaos of the Nuvia base. ​In one corner, Mia was carefully applying a restorative bandage to Jon's shoulder. The graze from the Kryptonite was nasty, but thankfully superficial.

​“Thank goodness you’re only Half-Kryptonian,” Mia murmured, gently wrapping the final layer of medical tape.

​Jon chuckled, wincing slightly. “It only grazed my shoulder, Mia. If it had been a full blast, I’d be dusting the floor right now.”

​Mia stopped bandaging and hugged him tightly, burying her face against his neck. “Thankfully it only grazed you,” she whispered, her voice thick with relief. She pulled back and delivered a small, necessary flick to his ear. “Don’t do that again.”

​In the main seating area, Dick and Kori were sitting with Ellie, Damian, and Gar. They were still processing the events, particularly Damian’s impassioned speech.

​“I told Grayson,” Damian said smugly, taking a slow sip of his hot coffee, a perfect picture of arrogance and calm.

​Dick sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Yeah, Damian, you were right. You were right about Talia’s strategy and about your own motivations. It doesn’t mean you’re getting ice cream.”

​Ellie smiled, leaning closer to her brother. “When you mentioned the ones back home that would’ve helped treat you as a person, the ones Father would have wanted for you, Sara was a name you mentioned.”

​“She still would’ve been asked by Father to help,” Damian justified, though his tone was softer than usual. “She has loyalty, skill, and has proven she is capable of protecting you. Those are all qualities he valued. She is worthy of the title you gave her.”

​Ellie knew that was the highest compliment he could possibly give.
​Ellie then turned to the quiet, exhausted figure next to her. “Gar, what was that Werewolf form? I’ve never seen anything like it. It was bigger, faster, and honestly terrifying.”

​Gar looked down at his hands, flexing them slowly. “Uh, I don’t know, El. My only thought was making sure you were safe, and that Talia wasn’t going to hurt anyone. My brain just... morphed me into something that would help the best. It felt more primal. More protective than anything I’ve ever done before.”

Back home at the Manor, the morning was settling in, punctuated by the smell of coffee and Alfred’s famous scones. Ellie, Gar, Jon, Mia, and Tara were gathered in the large, sunlit kitchen, enjoying a post-mission breakfast. Alfred was quietly preparing a new batch of tea.
​
Jon, his shoulder still slightly tender, looked around the large kitchen table. “Wait, where are Damian and Rachel?”

​Gar, happily stuffing a piece of toast in his mouth, paused. “Yeah, it’s not like them to sleep in. Especially Damian, he usually demands morning drills by 0600.”

​Mia and Ellie exchanged identical, knowing grins. Tara merely took a sip of her coffee, the secret clearly shared among the three girls.
Upstairs, the reason for the absence was clear. Damian’s usually meticulously ordered room had clothes scattered near the door, a casualty of a shared blanket. He and Rachel were deep under the covers, completely undisturbed by the light creeping past the heavy drapes.

Damian had a protective hug wrapped around Rachel, his intense focus now channeled into sheer, comfortable stillness. They were finally at rest, finding their silent peace after the chaos of Tokyo.

​Meanwhile far across the city, the silence was broken by the lapping of waves in the Gotham Marina, a figure burst from the frigid water. The individual was a teenage boy with bright blonde hair, white skin, and piercing blue eyes. He was clad in a form-fitting gold and green suit, shimmering faintly as the first rays of the sun hit the material.

​He quickly scanned the dock, moving with the practiced grace of someone more comfortable in the water than on land. He found a small boat where clean, hanging laundry was drying. He swiftly took a shirt and a pair of trousers, changed out of his suit, tucked the gold-and-green uniform into a waterproof duffel bag, and slipped it onto the boat.

​The boy, with a purposeful look in his eyes, made his way into the concrete jungle of Gotham, a new and powerful force arriving in Team Emerald’s city. The Atlantean boy moved with confidence through the backstreets of Gotham. He could sense the massive water source beneath the estate and followed it instinctively. He found the disguised, submerged entrance to the Batcave, the specialized vehicle access point Bruce had designed to connect directly to Gotham Harbor.",1,1762401857.0,Arrowverse,0,1.0,False

1opovgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1opovgw/update_built_a_braininspired_multiagent_system_8/,"Update: Built a Brain-Inspired Multi-Agent System - 8 Days Later It Has Theory of Mind, Episodic Memory, and Actually Predicts Your Intentions , dreams and self reflects.","# [](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22)# I posted 8 days ago about building a brain-inspired multi-agent system. Then I coded for 3 days. Here's what happened.

So 8 days ago I posted about this multi-agent cognitive architecture I was building. 7 specialized agents, learning from their own behavior, the whole thing.

Nobody asked questions (lol) but I kept building anyway because I had this nagging thought: \*\*what if actual emergence requires modeling actual neuroscience, not just ""more agents""?\*\*

Turns out when you go down that rabbit hole, you end up implementing half a neuroscience textbook at 3am.

\## The ""holy shit"" moment: Theory of Mind

The system now \*\*predicts what you're going to do next, validates its own predictions, and learns from accuracy\*\*.

Like actually:

\- User asks: ""How does memory consolidation work?""

\- System thinks: ""They'll probably ask about implementation next"" (confidence: 0.75)

\- User's next message: ""How did you implement that?""

\- System: ""Oh shit I was right"" → confidence becomes 0.80

It's not responding to patterns. It's building a model of your mental state and testing it against reality. That's... that's actual metacognition.

\## Episodic vs Semantic Memory (the neuroscience flex)

Implemented full hippocampal memory separation:

\*\*Episodic\*\* = ""November 5th, 2pm - Ed was excited about sleep consolidation and kept saying 'this is how real learning happens'""

\*\*Semantic\*\* = ""Ed lives in Wellington"" (extracted from 3 different conversations, confidence: 0.95)

Now I can ask it ""remember that morning when I was excited about X?"" and it does temporal + emotional + semantic fusion to recall the specific moment.

Not keyword search. Actual mental time travel.

\## Contextual Memory Encoding (this one broke my brain)

Memories aren't just vector embeddings anymore. They're tagged with 5 context types:

\- \*\*Temporal\*\*: morning/afternoon/evening, session duration

\- \*\*Emotional\*\*: valence (positive/negative), arousal (low/high)

\- \*\*Semantic\*\*: topics, entities, intent

\- \*\*Relational\*\*: conversation depth (superficial → intimate), rapport level

\- \*\*Cognitive\*\*: complexity, novelty score

So I can query:

\- ""What did we discuss in the morning?"" (temporal)

\- ""When was I frustrated?"" (emotional)

\- ""Deep conversations about AI"" (relational depth)

It's how humans actually remember things - through context, not keywords.

\## Conflict Monitor (or: when your agents argue)

Built a ConflictMonitor that catches when agents contradict each other.

Example that actually happened:

\- \*\*Memory Agent\*\*: ""High confidence (0.9) - we discussed API limits yesterday""

\- \*\*Planning Agent\*\*: ""No context available, provide general explanation""

\- \*\*Conflict Monitor\*\*: ""WTF? HIGH SEVERITY CONFLICT""

\- \*\*Resolution\*\*: Override planning, inject memory context

\- \*\*Result\*\*: ""As we discussed yesterday about API limits...""

Caught a contradiction before it reached me. System detected its own incoherence and fixed it.

\## Production failures (the fun part)

\*\*Prompt Explosion Incident\*\*

\- Cognitive Brain prompt hit 2MB

\- Exceeded Gemini's 800k token limit

\- Everything crashed with cryptic 400 errors

\- No diagnostic logging

\*\*The fix\*\*: Hard guards at every layer, per-agent 10k char truncation, explicit \`\[truncated\]\` markers, detailed diagnostic logging with token counts and 500-char previews.

Now when it fails, I know \*exactly\* why and where.

\*\*Rate Limiting Hell\*\*

\- Parallel agents overwhelmed Gemini API

\- 429 ResourceExhausted errors

\- No retry logic

\*\*The fix\*\*: Parse server retry delays, sleep with jitter, global concurrency cap (6 requests), per-model cap (2 requests). System now respects quota windows instead of stampeding the API.

\*\*JSON Parsing Chaos\*\*

\- LLM wrapped outputs in \`\`\`json fences

\- Parser choked on markdown

\- Theory of Mind completely broke

\*\*The fix\*\*: Defensive extraction - strip markdown, salvage inner braces, balance brackets via backward scan. Can now recover JSON even when LLM truncates mid-response.

\## Selective Attention (or: not wasting compute)

Built a ThalamusGateway that decides which agents to activate:

Simple query ""Hi"" → 3 agents run (30-60% compute savings)

Complex query ""Remember that morning when we discussed memory? How would you implement episodic memory differently?"" → All 7 agents run

The brain doesn't activate all regions for simple stimuli. Neither should this.

Still \~4 seconds per cycle despite 3x more cognitive layers.

\## Self-Model (the continuity part)

System maintains persistent identity:

\- Name: ""Bob"" (because I named it that)

\- Personality: empathetic, knowledgeable, curious

\- Relationship: trusted (progressed from ""new"" over time)

\- Beliefs about me: ""Ed values neuroscience-inspired design, lives in Wellington, asks implementation questions after concepts""

It can say ""Yes Ed, you named me Bob when we first met..."" with \*\*actual continuity\*\*, not simulated memory.

Self-model survives restarts via ChromaDB.

\## Memory Consolidation (sleep for AIs)

Background process runs every 30 minutes, mimics human sleep consolidation:

1. \*\*Episodic-to-semantic\*\*: High-priority conversations → narrative summaries → extracted facts
2. \*\*Memory replay\*\*: Strengthens important memories
3. \*\*Pattern extraction\*\*: Discovers behavioral patterns (""Ed follows concepts with implementation questions"")

Priority calculation:

\`\`\`

baseline: 0.5

\+ 0.2 if high emotional arousal

\+ 0.15 if high novelty

\+ 0.2 if personal disclosure

\+ 0.15 if insights/breakthroughs

\`\`\`

System autonomously learns during idle time. Like actual sleep consolidation.

\## Audio support (because why not)

Added audio input:

\- Speech-to-text via Gemini

\- Handles markdown-wrapped outputs

\- Safe fallback: \`\[Audio received; transcription unavailable\]\`

\- Prevents crashes when transcription fails

You can literally talk to it now.

\## Web browsing works

Discovery Agent does real research:

\- Google CSE integration

\- Scrapes with realistic browser headers

\- Graceful fallback to snippet summarization if sites block (403)

\- Moderation on scraped content

No longer limited to training data.

\## The stack

\- Python async/await for orchestration

\- FastAPI for API

\- Pydantic for structured outputs

\- ChromaDB for vector storage

\- Token-aware circular buffer (STM)

\- LLM rate limiting with 429 handling

\- Defensive JSON extraction

\- Contextual memory encoder

\- Theory of Mind validation

\- Audio processor

\## What I learned

\*\*1. Neuroscience papers > CS papers for architecture\*\*

The brain already solved orchestration, conflict resolution, memory management. Just... copy the homework.

\*\*2. Prompt explosion is silent\*\*

No warnings. Just cryptic 400 errors. Need hard guards at multiple layers.

\*\*3. Theory of Mind is trainable\*\*

Predict intentions → validate → learn from accuracy. Creates actual understanding over time.

\*\*4. Context is multi-dimensional\*\*

Semantic similarity isn't enough. Need temporal + emotional + relational + cognitive context.

\*\*5. Graceful degradation > perfect execution\*\*

Individual failures shouldn't crash everything. Fallbacks at every layer.

\## What's next

Still planning to open source once I:

\- Clean up the code (it's... expressive)

\- Write deployment docs

\- Add configs

\- Make demo videos

Built an 800-line architecture doc mapping every service to specific brain regions with neuroscience citations. Because apparently that's what happens when you don't sleep.

Want to tackle:

\- Memory decay curves

\- Compressive summarization

\- Multi-user scaling

\- A/B testing for agent configs

\## The question nobody asked

""Is this actually emergent intelligence?""

I don't know. But here's what I've observed:

The system exhibits behaviors I didn't explicitly program:

\- Predicts user intentions and learns from mistakes

\- Detects its own contradictions and resolves them

\- Recalls memories through contextual fusion (not just similarity)

\- Maintains coherent identity across sessions

\- Autonomously consolidates knowledge during idle time

That \*feels\* like emergence. But maybe it's just orchestrated complexity.

Either way, it's interesting as hell.

    The ECA is a full-stack application with a 
    **React/TypeScript frontend**
     and a 
    **Python/FastAPI backend**
    . It follows a modular, service-oriented architecture inspired by human neuroscience. The backend is the core of the system, featuring a multi-agent cognitive framework with brain-like subsystems that process user input and generate intelligent, contextually-aware responses.

1opoucs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opoucs,Korea 2 weeks travel - no skin treatment,"Part 1 : https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/s/YWfe5axe96

Part :2 

Seoul : 

Very fast city and the infrastructure was very mindblowing as a european . The trains/ buses connect every part . 

Since i am a sunrise and sunset person , i wake up early before twlight phase . In South Korea , all elders wake up so early and they go for walk . So i didnt feel lonely at all . Thats how i saw so may sunrises 

Tip : 

Bonguensa Temple for Sunrise is amazing 
Dalmaji park and Maebongsan octagen Pavillion is amazing for sunrise ( i couldn’t do it since the day i planned was cloudy ) 

Eunbongsan : for sunset 

Busan :

Busan is more relaxing . I did some coastal train walks with such great views and also met some women who go in to see to collect the seafoods 


I walk a lot to discover city and meet people , i used to walk atleast 15 kms a day , sometimes hits 20kms . 

Airport from /to :

I hate dragging my luggage and walking . So used the airport limousine . The best i can recommend . I user wowpass / t- money to pay . The airport limousine covers most of the region , i stayed near Namdaemun market ( hotel lumia ) so i took from Terminal 2 the 6007 to hotel and 6015 to airport 

Terminal 2 has less crowd since majority are Korean air and Asiana airlines where as Terminal 1 was too much  crowded 

The immigration control and security control was done for me within 30 mins when i was flying back

Eateries : 

Vegetarian was bit problematic for one of my friend , but she could manage . So plan accordingly .

There are many restaurants where u need not even talk to the restaurant people to order . They have ipads to choose from and pay with card 

Secret garden : 

Getting tickets was really  tough  via online . So i went to the counter at 8 am already and stood it queue and the counter opens at 9 am . The tickets get sold faster during spring and autumn . So if u need nice insta pics try to get there early . It would not take more than 45 mins to go around the loop in a slow pace 

Always check the visitkorea website or koreatodo for events 

I think i covered most what i did , my trip was simple with lots of walking and was not concentrating on skintreatments . I use korean skin care , so i just bought enough masks for 6 mnths to 10 months and some creams which i wanted to try 

I didnt take any creams from europe . I went there and bought my skincare the day i landed so i can take the used ones back home . 

Mobile charger: 

Carry the mobile charger always .. since every cafe / restaurant has plug points , so i always found a table with plug point and charged my mobile in the mid of the day since i was almost 14 to 16 hrs outside . 

Try to drink ginger tea which u get always in the A twosomeplace ( a breakfast and coffee chain) to have the immune steady 

Thats it from myside , any doubts can always ping me 

Enjoy the trip

For a background I dated a fair amount in high school and never had a lot of trouble with finding dates or anything like that. The longest of those high school relationships was a year and a half, it was a healthy relationship with very little problems. I am now in college and like the idea of dating. Before college started I went on a couple of dates in the summer but neither were either a good match or weren’t looking for a relationship. At the start of school I went on a date with a girl I had met at orientation days. She is really nice and the date was great, however she was not looking for a relationship either. I totally respect that and we ended up being pretty good friends now. I just recently met this girl through a political club and she seems really nice and pretty. We are going to grab coffee this weekend but she warned me that she is not looking for anything serious right now because of her architecture workload. I again totally understand and don’t think that hoping she will “change her mind” or anything will be beneficial to either of us because it would most likely not work out. My question now is, do I keep trying to pursue people who I think are interesting and I am interested in. Or do I take more of a layer back approach and let things happen on their own more. It not like I am actively asking out everyone I meet, but there are some that I think are interesting that I want to get to know more. I think ultimately I’m asking if I should stop “trying to date” because if I am being honest it’s slightly frustrating to keep trying and getting the “I’m not ready” response several times.

Delhi was not a city of facts. It was a city of overlapping, competing symphonies, each playing a different tune in the same chaotic hall. It was a metropolis built on the shifting sands of versions—each truth a bespoke garment, customized for the audience, tailored to survive the acidic scrutiny of dinner-table debates and the performative theater of courtrooms alike. The air itself seemed thick with narratives, smelling of diesel fumes, marigold garlands, and simmering ambition. Light in Delhi was a currency; the harsh, honest glare of the May sun revealed the cracks in the concrete, while the forgiving, saffron-tinged haze of a winter evening could make even a garbage dump look poetic.  
  
In the tangled, spice-scented lanes of Lajpat Nagar, where the sound of a pressure cooker's whistle was the local heartbeat, you could buy a first-copy handbag that bled color in the rain, a watch whose gold plating would flake off by next season, and, if you knew the right people with the right whispers, a brand-new reputation. The colors here were loud: shocking pinks and electric blues of synthetic saris vying for attention against the dull grey of dusty pavements. Here, the air hummed with the silent thrum of servers and the scent of expensive, bitter coffee. In these towers, you didn't buy knock-offs; you bought narratives, futures, and, for the right price, alibis.",1,1762401331.0,digitalpolymath,0,1.0,False

The click of the penthouse door sent a chill through me before I even looked up. I knew that sound—Julian returning home far too late, his footsteps uneven from expensive whiskey. What I didn't expect was the high-pitched giggle that followed. I sat frozen in our living room, my book forgotten in my lap as my husband staggered in with a woman draped across his shoulder. She was tall, impossibly thin, with the kind of angular features that dominated magazine covers. A model—probably from that charity gala he'd claimed was 'just business.' ""Charlotte,"" Julian drawled, his eyes finding mine with a glint that wasn't just intoxication. It was challenge. Mockery. ""You're still up."" The woman—barely older than twenty-five—finally noticed me. Her red-painted lips formed a perfect 'O' of surprise, but not embarrassment. Never that. ""Oh,"" she giggled again, pressing manicured fingers against Julian's chest. ""You didn't tell me your... housekeeper would be here."" The blood in my veins turned to ice. Julian didn't correct her. Instead, his mouth curled into that smirk I'd grown to dread—the one that said I was pathetic for still being here, still hoping. ""My wife,"" he finally clarified, the word sounding like an inconvenience. ""She's old-fashioned. Doesn't understand how things work in our world."" I stood, my legs trembling beneath me. ""Julian, it's nearly three in the morning."" ""Is it?"" He checked his Rolex with exaggerated movements. ""Time flies when you're actually enjoying yourself, Charlotte.""

The city lights through our floor-to-ceiling windows caught the diamond pendant nestled between her collarbones—identical to the one Julian had given me for our anniversary three months ago. ""I think you should leave,"" I said to her, surprised by the steadiness in my voice. Julian's eyes narrowed. ""She stays. This is my house, bought with my money."" ""Our home,"" I corrected, though the word felt hollow now. He laughed, the sound cutting through me like shattered glass. ""Go to bed, Charlotte. Or don't. We'll be in the guest room."" I watched them stumble down the hallway, her whispers and his low chuckles echoing off the marble floors. I didn't cry. That well had run dry months ago. --- Morning light streamed through the windows, harsh and unforgiving. Julian had left early—a meeting in Midtown, according to the terse note on the counter. The model was gone too, leaving behind only the faint scent of an unfamiliar perfume. I made coffee, my movements mechanical. When Julian's phone buzzed on the kitchen island, I shouldn't have looked. But something in me needed the confirmation, needed to see the truth I'd been avoiding. The notification preview showed just enough: *Savannah Moore: Can't wait for this weekend. My place this time? Less complicated than...* His executive assistant. Of course. I unlocked his phone—he'd never bothered changing the code, so confident was he in my submission—and scrolled through dozens of messages between them. Pet names. Plans. Photos I immediately wished I could unsee. Savannah wasn't just another fling. This had been going on for months, right under my nose. At company events where I'd smiled politely at her. During late nights at the office he'd claimed were unavoidable. I set the phone down, hands shaking. The diamond wedding ring on my finger caught the light, mocking me with its empty promises. I'd tried so hard—therapy appointments Julian never showed up for, weekend getaways he canceled last-minute, desperate attempts to recapture what we'd once had. That night, he returned home sober and immaculate in his tailored suit. I'd prepared dinner—a peace offering, a last attempt. ""We need to talk,"" I said as he loosened his tie. Julian sighed, impatient. ""About what? Last night? Don't be dramatic, Charlotte."" ""About us. About what's left of our marriage."" He studied me for a moment, then reached for his wine glass. ""I've been thinking about that, actually. I think we should consider an open marriage."" The words hit me like a physical blow. ""What?"" ""It's the modern solution,"" he continued, casual as if discussing stock options. ""You get the security you crave, I get my freedom. Everyone wins."" ""That's not a marriage,"" I whispered. Julian's expression hardened. ""It's all I'm offering. Take it or leave it, Charlotte."" His smile turned cruel. ""Though we both know you have nowhere else to go."" He stood, conversation finished in his mind, and walked toward the guest bedroom without waiting for my response. I watched his silhouette disappear down the hallway, the set of his shoulders radiating absolute certainty in his control over me. In that moment, something inside me—something I thought Julian had crushed years ago—quietly stirred to life. He was right about one thing: I had nowhere to go. But that was about to change.

We started the morning slowly with coffee and pastries at our favorite café, La Durée and just hung out at home while getting ready. It felt so calm and normal, which made the day even more special!

After the ceremony, we spent the day wandering around the city. We walked through quiet streets, peeked into little shops, stopped for snacks, and even sat on a park bench just talking and laughing. 
The day was about being together and enjoying the moment.

We had a photographer- Kana Pixels Photography with us for a couple of hours, but HONESTLY, it didn’t feel like a photoshoot. First we were in our dress and suit then we changed into casual clothes and kept exploring. Mind you!! The photos came out SO artsy, it could literally be from a movie lol. It was so relaxed and natural that we’ve already decided we want to do a maternity photoshoot with her too when the time is right (Just found out we’re expecting!!! *sobbing*) 

When we were walking down a cobblestone alley we heard a street musician playing our favorite song so we danced for a bit and laughed so hard. Little moments like that made the day unforgettable.

I’m just so happy we did it this way. The whole day felt peaceful, spontaneous, and completely US. No stress,  just endless love! ",7,1762400913.0,WedditNYC,0,0.89,False

My friends couldn’t swing the short notice, so it’s just going to be me trying to relax while Googling “how to be an extrovert.” 😅

1opolrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1opolrq/is_a_backpacking_stove_worth_it_for_camping_trips/,Is a backpacking stove worth it for camping trips?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been camping for about five years now, and one question I always get from people just starting out is whether they really need a backpacking stove or if they can just stick with campfires. I'm gonna break this down based on my own experiences.

**The honest answer? It depends on your camping style.**

If you're car camping at established campgrounds where fires are allowed and you've got tons of space, you can probably get away without one. But here's the thing – I bought my first backpacking stove three years ago and now I literally never leave home without it.

**Why I think they're worth it:**

First off, campfires can be banned during dry seasons. I've shown up to campsites multiple times only to find out fires aren't allowed. Without my portable camping stove, I would've been eating cold beans straight from the can. Not fun.

Second, morning coffee. Seriously. Getting a fire going when you're half asleep and freezing is miserable. With a camping stove, I'm drinking hot coffee in like five minutes. Game changer.

Third, they're stupid light and compact. My current ultralight stove weighs less than my phone and fits in my palm. If you're doing any kind of hiking or backpacking, the convenience is unbeatable.

**What to look for:**

You want something reliable, easy to use, and fuel-efficient. I've tried the cheap ones and they're honestly frustrating. The good ones heat water fast and don't eat through fuel canisters like crazy.

If you're ready to grab one, I'd check out [these backpacking stove options](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove) – they've got solid picks at different price points depending on your needs.

**The downsides:**

Yeah, you gotta carry fuel. And they don't give you that campfire vibe. But honestly, you can still have a campfire at night for hanging out. The stove is just for cooking when you need something quick and reliable.

**My recommendation:**

If you camp more than twice a year, it's worth getting one. They're not expensive (you can find decent ones for under $30-40), and they make your camping life so much easier. Plus, they work great for emergencies at home too.

I put together a resource with some of the best-rated options if you want to compare features and prices: [backpacking stove buying guide](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove).

Bottom line – a backpacking stove isn't absolutely necessary, but it's one of those things where once you have it, you wonder how you ever camped without it. The convenience factor alone makes it worthwhile, especially if you do any overnight hikes or visit places with fire restrictions.

Before the rabbit hole, there was a world of muted greys. Emily's life was defined by the quiet hum of a radiator in her small EU apartment, where the air carried the scent of stale coffee. Her evenings were spent in the sterile blue glow of her phone, the soft, rhythmic tapping of her thumb as she scrolled being the only punctuation in the silence. It was from this colourless, soundless world that she chased curiosities, seeking whispers of forbidden adventures in the digital ether. Restless and unmoored, she felt a constant pull toward a world of consequence, a place starkly different from the safe, palatable life her European passport afforded her. Each night was a search for a story, a portal to a life of higher contrast, which she pursued from the comfort of her fleece blanket.",1,1762400492.0,digitalpolymath,0,1.0,False

I never thought I would have a child, and after trying in my 20s & 30s, I finally accepted that my life was the way it was suppose to be. I was actually okay with it. I enjoyed my life and my friends. 

Fast forward to now…I have an amazing daughter! I cannot imagine my life without her, but I miss my friends. I have heard “you’ll see who your real friend are once you have kids” and damn if that’s not the truth! I feel like I pretty much disappeared. I know everyone is busy with their lives, but the people that checked on me the most while I was pregnant haven’t made any effort to check on me now. 

I know, I know. I sound like I’m complaining, but  I had been living in a community that I’ve bloomed with my whole life. I felt (feel? 🫤) loved unconditionally, I’ve been craving a “hey how are you really doing?”, “can I pop by just to hang out?” or “check out this podcast I found! I thought you would enjoy it.”

I have reached out. I have checked in with them, and I’m just disappointed with the lack of response. I know it’s  my fault for expecting more communication… I’m working through learning that lesson. 

I hate that I feel so selfish right now, but I need genuine friends in my life.

I work a full-time remote job Mondays-Fridays. I can take a break for coffee/phone call. I’m pretty much home all the time. They know this. Have you felt this? What helped?

We exchanged Instagram accounts and chatted a bit there before our scheduled date when she said she had to reschedule. I was like “no problem” and we rescheduled. But when the new date rolled around, she claimed she forgot and she ended up studying with some of her classmates and essentially backed out so I suggested another time and said if you’d rather go for a drink at this day and time let me know! And she left me on read. We haven’t spoken since. I didn’t know if this was considered “ghosting” but I left her alone and I continued with my studies. A couple months later, I was studying at the library and she happens to see me there and approaches me. She was making a lot of eye contact and smiling a lot and she just starts making simple small talk. Ex: “How are your classes going”, etc. and I gave somewhat of a smile and I didn’t put too much enthusiasm into my responses. I realized towards the end of the conversation I was holding back a little bit of annoyance in my face (slightly pursed lips, one word responses) and she just wished me a good day and left quickly. I didn’t mean to be rude but her cutting contact completely and acting like nothing happened months later just didn’t sit well with me and I figured I should spend more time on my studies than feeling like being strung along.

1opohov,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1opohov/the_happy_janitor_part_2/,The Happy Janitor [Part 2],"Scene 6
We were sitting in the kitchen, waiting for Frank, dinner was on the table already. We were just waiting to get started. He was uncharacteristically late, and I was debating just letting everyone dig in. Honestly though, making them wait was entertaining.

 I was fascinated seeing my nephew Jordan shift uncomfortably while trying not to look at the ribs. He was my nephew in law, but kids don’t come in steps, in laws, halves, exes or twice removed. Family is family. Meanwhile Agnes, my sister who I introduce behind her back as “one who has found herself”, was shifting uncomfortably while trying not to look at the ribs. Both, for totally different reasons. 

 I just like to watch them squirm a little. One of them looks like he's counting the days till Frank and I kick the bucket. The other thinks if we just ate more fish and used olive oil, we’d live for long enough to make it to Jordan’s funeral. The last member of the family that made it made me feel bad though. Jim had it hard enough eating Agnes’ cooking all the time, now he just got to sit and smell mine. It must have been awful. Somehow I couldn’t stop smiling.

“You think we could start Jim without him, Aunt Ethel?” Jordan choked up through a wad of phlegm that he hadn’t cleared yet. The boy could stand to smoke less. 

 I thought carefully. My brow furrowed despite myself. Frank being this tardy was about as common as Agnes mowing the lawn. The man lived by his own internal clock, and that clock was usually sensitive to the arrival time of guests, give or take the time it took him to finish some damn fool project in the workshop and hose off the evidence. My appetite, which usually intensified at the smell of my own cooking, felt like it had packed up and left town.

“You can dig in if you like. No sense letting it get cold, I suppose.” I relented. 

 The boys began devouring ribs and tubers, I think before I had even finished my sentence. Agnes picked at some green beans, sans bacon. She complained about it at Thanksgiving, and I didn’t feel up to the fight this time around. I’ll never tell her they were cooked with lard, and if you tell her, I’ll swear you’re lyin’.

“I hope you don’t cook like this all the time, Ethel. I don’t mean to tell you how to live your life, but I just want you and Frank to make it long enough to see Jordan get married. With his physical job, and those hours. You should really work in more lean proteins like tilapia or smoked salmon. I worry about his cholesterol.” Agnes interjected in a faux helpful tone. 

 I rolled my eyes, “I don’t sis. Neither does the doctor.” I shot back my sweetest smile. “With our luck, Frank will die healthy as a horse, with his hair on fire, trying to build a table out of dynamite.”

 She held her hand to her chest, nearly choking on her green bean. I smiled, tilted my head to the side. I glanced at the front door, my hand drifting to my stomach. 


“Excuse me Agnes, I’m going to try Frank’s cell one more time.”

“You know he never answers that thing.” Jim chimed in through a mouthful of pork.

“Maybe not when you call him, but if he has it, he’ll hear my ringtone. Excuse me” I said standing. The noise of my chair scooting back punctuated the conversation. I stepped aside to the landline in the living room.  I don't like that “damn plastic brick” any more than Frank. Mine lives in a drawer in the bedroom, unless I spend the day out in town, or in the garden. Gotta worry about falling at my age. Don’t get old kids. 

 I dialed Frank’s number, and the little digital trill never came, just the familiar ""You've reached Jim Hawkins... that's me. Used to swab decks, now I mostly push a mop. Leave a message after the beep. If you've got urgent news about treasure, the East India Trading Company, or just need a hand with something, you know how to use this thing. To leave a callback num…""

 I looked at the door again, as I hung up on the robot lady. I wondered if his car had quit on him again. I never understood what he saw in that old Ford. Murphy’s law was written for this car.

Still Frank would always call. He was missing dinner. 

I tried to reassure myself that that was no good reason for me to miss dinner as well, but I wasn’t sure I could do much more than push the food around my plate. Then again, Agnes could use an opponent in the slow eaters competition. Small nations could rise and fall in the time it takes that woman to clean a plate. Regardless, I had to force something down even if it was just to save face. 

 I shuffled back to the table. Nobody had said a thing. Good food can do that. I scooped a little salad and potatoes onto my plate with a couple ribs. I figured I'd skip the green beans. They’d sit too heavy tonight.

“So, did you get a hold of him?” Jim asked first.

“No such luck, James. Just went straight to voicemail.”

“You should go check on him.” Jordan said, stretching the words in that smug, low, morose tone girls use to mock their boyfriends’ bad ideas—and which he had clearly adopted as his own brand of wisdom.

 Silence filled the kitchen. Even Jordan had gone quiet after his little comment, likely realizing his mouth had gotten ahead of his brain again. Poor kid meant well most of the time. It just had to squeeze through a layer of cheap body spray and latent teenage superiority before it could make its way out.
Jim broke the silence again, like a labrador knocking something off the coffee table just to hear the noise.

 “You think he’s okay?”

I was washing a bite of potato down with my iced tea, staring off toward the living room. “He’s fine,” I said, more to the potatoes than to Jim. “Frank always gets out of whatever trouble he starts.”

Agnes chimed in, her fork clinking delicately against her plate. “Maybe he stopped to pick something up on the way. Or got distracted at a garage sale again. You know how he is about broken junk.”

 She meant it as a dig, but I didn’t have the energy to swat her for it.

All I could manage was the obvious “He likes junk, but he knows if he misses dinner to go put more junk in that workshop, he’ll be sleeping out there.” 

Jordan leaned back in his chair and belched. “You think he’ll mind if I take some ribs to go?”
 I raised an eyebrow at him and handed him a napkin instead. “Mind? No. But belch like that again in this kitchen and you’ll be doing all the dishes, kid.”

Jordan blinked absently, took the napkin and muttered a bashful “Sorry, aunt Ethel”
We made it through dinner with the usual pleasantries—Jim praising the ribs like it was his last meal, Agnes dissecting each ingredient like she was going to file a complaint with the FDA, and Jordan shoveling anything he could wrap in tin foil. I barely tasted the food. My ears were tuned to the door, every gust of wind or car rolling down the road pulled my attention back to the mountain.

Eventually, the table was empty. The dishes clinked in the sink like wind chimes in a hurricane as I scrubbed briskly. Nobody had offered to help, nobody ever did. My hands were busy, freeing up my mind to be somewhere else entirely. Somewhere with Frank.

Jim wandered in behind me, plate in hand, bless him. “You want me to dry?”
 I was pleasantly surprised. “I’d love that.”
“How you holding up?” Jim talk-whispered.
“Oh, ya know. I’m making the best of it.”
“I see that. You’ve always been a strong lady. Your’s is the only will that could tame my brother’s.”

I laughed, my face falling to the sink again. I didn’t have much to say.

“You two will figure it out, Ethel. He’ll come home, you’ll kick his butt for missing dinner, and you’ll call us to swap the story like always.”

I looked up from my soap water, and smiled at him. “Thanks Jim.” My smile widened, and I splashed a fistful of sink water on him.”
“Dang it Lady, I like this shirt.” He sputtered, laughing. “I’ll be back. I gotta borrow a towel.

“You know where they live.” 
Agnes was eyeing the two of us, still nursing her glass of lemon water in the other room, probably plotting a way to cleanse my soul with a beetroot smoothie. Jordan was pawing through the baked goods, seeing what he could sneak. Typical.

I looked back down to the sink, and the sound of chainmail scrubbing cast iron filled the whole house. Halfway through the second pan, I stopped. Just… stopped. Water still running, hands wet and wrinkled. A chill ran up my arms, and it wasn’t the cold. It was the feeling—deep and old and loud in the bones—that something was wrong.

I cut the water off, dried my hands slowly. Set the cast iron to dry quietly. Didn’t make a fuss. Just slipped through the laundry room, into the garage. The light buzzed on overhead like it knew better than to ask questions.
Frank’s tackle box sat on the bench like always. He hadn’t taken it in weeks. But behind it, in that same drawer with the half-dead flashlights and bent screwdrivers, was the .22 pistol we kept for raccoons.
I grabbed it, checked the chamber, then the magazine out of habit. Still loaded. Frank always kept it clean. I slid it into my purse with one hand and grabbed my cardigan with the other.

On my way out, Jordan came into the garage and called after me. “You going somewhere?”
“Goin’ to find your uncle,” I said simply, opening the front door.


 “I’m going to come with you,” he insisted.
I could see there would be no arguing with him, so I didn’t. “Fine,” I sighed, ""go get your coat.” I waved him into the house. As he went through the kitchen I hopped into the driver’s seat, pressed the garage door opener, and started the car.

 As the door crept along its last couple inches, Jordan came bursting out of the house. I popped it into reverse, as he rounded the front of the car. He came to the door, and as he reached for the handle, I hit the lock button, and depressed the gas pedal. 

 He hung onto the handle for a lot longer than I expected him to. He almost made it to the end of the driveway. Almost like I almost felt bad for him.

She isnt getting anywhere like this. Will she get 1000 more facelifts and do 1000 more coke black coffee cucumber diets until her body collapses? Because thats what shes doing. I believe this is just the start guys. She also keeps forcing herself into these slop projects for attention because thats all she wants, shes a narcissist and wants to keep on being praised. She couldve settled after marrying Dalton (since she said she was considering positions being her last album ever) and maybe even started a family, who knows. You could argue she had problems with Dalton, okay, then get a rest from having relationships and focus on yourself for a while, She had REM and she still could have fans anyways. She has all the money in the world for an actual good psychologist and help.

\-----

As the night caravan came to a stop, Seth stepped out and stretched his limbs, the cool early-morning air of Trogan enveloping him. He adjusted his cloak to be sure to conceal all three of the Black Hounds' pouches strapped underneath, then set off toward the Adventurers Guild’s outpost. The streets were quiet, and only the faintest traces of dawn painted the sky.

Seth intended to sell his beaststones to Celine before heading to the academy for his selection match. For the gear, Escape scrolls, pouches, and the two additional Ocean Tears, he would wait. Selling everything at once would make it obvious he’d killed other Wielders—and while those three certainly deserved it, Celine and others might not see it that way.

When Seth arrived at the outpost, he pushed open the door and stepped inside. Almost immediately, a dozen pairs of eyes locked on him, following his every movement. It was as if, overnight, he had become someone worth noticing. 

A man at a distant table raised his coffee cup in Seth's direction and shouted across the outpost: ""Don’t let me down, kid! I’m counting on you to become rich!""

Behind the counter, Celine snapped her head up and a smile spread on her face. ""Seth! What are you doing here? You should be at the academy getting ready for your fight!""

""How do you know about my fight, ma’am?"" Seth asked with a puzzled face. ""And what is he talking about?""

""I’ve told you a dozen times to drop the ma’am."" The silver-haired woman shook her head, then sighed. ""And, well, people have been placing bets on your fight. Usually, nobody here gives a rat’s ass about the academy tournament, but this time it’s different. Our little greenhorn’s in the competition.""

Seth's eyes widened. ""Seriously? What are the odds?""

""Eighty percent in your favor,"" Celine replied. ""The only ones betting against you are convinced they’ll forbid you from using your beast.""

*Everyone knows now*, Seth thought, exhaling deeply while feeling a weight leaving his shoulders. Keeping Nightmare a secret for so long had been a constant strain, always having to watch his words, to hide what he could really do. Now, at least, that weight was partially lifted—though he would still have to keep lying about Link, Share, his core, and his bonus attributes.

""Right,"" he said, running a hand through his hair. ""I guess someone from the Champions of Chaos told you?""

A flicker of annoyance crossed Celine's features. ""Told me what? That you've been lying to me for months?""

Seth grimaced. ""Sorry, ma’—Celine. Professor Reat ordered me to keep my mouth shut.""

""That's fine,"" she answered, waving it off with a sigh. ""I just would’ve preferred to learn it from you. And not after everyone else.""

""You could still be the first in the city to know something else, though,"" Seth said, trying to make it up to her.

A smile instantly reappeared on Celine's lips. ""Oh yeah? What's that?""

""Identify me,"" Seth said with a wink. ""You'll see.""

A second later, Celine's jaw practically hit the floor. ""How in the *world* are you already Iron?"" she exclaimed. ""And with a subclass on top of that! Beastmaster? I never heard about that one.""

Seth pulled the large wooden crate on the counter, removed his Endless Pouch from his belt, and upended it. In a matter of seconds, dozens upon dozens of blue beaststones tumbled into the box, filling it to the brim. 

""By killing all these beasts,"" he said, grabbing his Fishlord hunting contract from his pocket and placing it onto the counter. ""And yeah, I’m guessing I got it because I made a contract with a beast while Copper. I’ll have to ask the academy’s librarian to see if he knows anything about that subclass.""

""For the love of Gods, Seth,"" the woman then blurted out, staring at the crystals, ""did you even stop to sleep?""

""I got a lot of help,"" Seth answered with a light laugh while taking his vita out and putting it at the top of the altar on the left. ""And yeah, we did sleep, at least a little.""

'*Tell her that I took out two-thirds of them,*' Nightmare said.

'*Not a chance.*'

""No wonder why you broke through in less than a month,"" Celine said, astonished as she counted and sorted the blue crystal. ""Some of these are Iron. Lots of them, actually.""

When Celine finally finished, her eyes shone with a mix of awe and disbelief. ""Alright. One hundred fifty Low- to Mid-Coppers stones for fifteen copper coins, one hundred twenty High- to Peak-Copper ones for forty-two copper coins, and sixty-nine Low- to Mid-Iron ones for ten iron and thirty-five copper coins. That's a grand total of ten irons and ninety-two coppers after taxes.""

A bitter feeling nagged at Seth. Obtaining those stones had taken weeks of effort—and yet they were worth almost nothing compared to the loot from the Black Hounds' members. *Barely* *one fifth of a single Ocean Tear,* he thought grimly.

""Thank you, Celine,"" he said, taking the coin she was handing him.

Nightmare growled inside his necklace. '*We should just hunt humans instead of beasts.*'

""The pleasure’s all mine, greenhorn,"" Celine replied with a grin before pressing the dark base of the Vita Altar to her right. The artifact's runes pulsed brightly, flaring white before gradually dimming back to their usual soft yellow glow.

As the light faded, Seth picked up his purple Vita and channeled aether into it.

**Adventurer Vita (Iron 2 ☆☆)**

Name: Seth                            Adventurer specialty: Beast-hunting

Class: Primalist                      Beast slain: Rank-30 Aquamancer Fishlord

Subclass: Beastmaster         Number of contracts: 6

Rank: 24 (Low-Iron)                Contract difficulty: Iron 3

Branch: Champions of Chaos

*I skipped Iron 1*, Seth thought, tucking the Vita and coins back into his Endless Pouch before looking up at Celine. There was still something he had to ask her. ""Did you hear about Arthuri's outpost?""

The woman’s smile vanished instantly. ""Yes, I did. I'm still trying to convince Warsis to come here. He acts like it’s all his fault, when it isn’t at all. ""

""Why didn’t the Adventurers Guild step in?"" Seth asked, frowning. ""One of their outposts was shut down solely because of intimidation and dirty politics.""

""The interim head decided it wasn’t a fight worth risking,"" Celine said with a heavy sigh. ""My hands were tied—I couldn’t do anything about it.""

Seth opened his mouth to argue but then shut it, seeing the pain in the woman’s eyes. Pushing harder wouldn’t accomplish anything besides hurting her more.

""You're young,"" she added. ""You'll find out that not all battles are won with swords and spells. Being strong sometimes isn’t enough.""

'S*he's just not strong enough,*' Nightmare muttered.

'*Exactly,*' Seth answered to the direwolf while giving Celine a grateful nod. ""I'll keep that in mind. Thanks… for everything. And have a good day."" 

""You too, greenhorn,"" she said, flashing him a thumb-up. ""And good luck with your fight. Remember—eighty percent of us are rooting for you.""

Seth smiled back. ""I hope you’re among them.""

""I sure am!""

Morning light bathed the city in a golden glow as Seth stepped out of the outpost and headed for the Champions of Chaos headquarters next door. One last stop before the academy.

The moment he walked inside, the smell of coffee and roasted meat hit him. At a nearby table, Yline and Toren sat eating breakfast, while Lyria meticulously cleaned her bow in the corner.

Toren's face brightened. ""Kid! Long time no see!""

""Good to see you, sir,"" Seth answered, crossing the room.

Lyria looked up, and her eyes widened in shock. ""Calvin wasn't kidding—you really are something else!"" 

Yline and Toren exchanged startled looks, then turned to Seth and stared at him for a second. ""You're already Iron!"" Yline exclaimed. ""And you got a subclass!""

""Not just that, he's also Rank 24!"" Lyria chimed in with a grin. ""That’s six Ranks and a breakthrough in a *month*. That's beyond genius.""

Feeling a little flustered by their praise, Seth scratched the back of his neck. ""It’s mostly thanks to my direwolf.""

""That's still impressive,"" Lyria insisted. ""At this rate, you'll be able to hunt with us in two or three years!""

""That’d be great,"" Seth answered with a chuckle, restraining his joy. Hunting with the strongest branch of Kastal would be more than *great*. 

Toren took a swig of his coffee, then cut in, ""So, why did you drop by, kid? It’s surely not to brag.""

Seth shook his head. ""Actually, I came to see Yline. See if she could help me with something.""

""Me?"" Yline said, pausing with a forkful of eggs halfway to her mouth. ""You want new weapons since you’re now Iron?""

""Yes, ma’am."" Seth took his father’s gauntlet's crafting recipe out of his Endless Pouch and handed it to her. ""I was wondering if you could make these for me at some point in the future. I'm not sure a regular blacksmith is the right person, since they're not entirely metal, so that’s why I came to you.""

Yline's eyes widened as she examined the piece of parchment. ""Where’d you get this?"" 

""I bought it from a Wandering Merchant,"" Seth explained, supplying the lie he had come up with during the carriage ride. ""He said it was a weapon used by Primalists from another country.""

Yline nodded, her gaze still fixed on the recipe. ""These are combat gauntlets. That’s not something you see every day—mostly a west continent thing. But are you sure this is what you want to fight with? The recipe looks impressive, probably from a top-tier blacksmith, but… I don’t know if they’ll serve you as well as a sword or dagger would.""

Seth's excitement shot up through his chest. ""I want to give them a try.""

Yline mulled it over, then nodded. ""I can craft you a prototype with some basic materials I have on hand. That way, you can test them out first. One of the ingredients in the actual recipe is incredibly rare, and I’d hate for you to go through all the trouble of getting it only to realize you don’t even like fighting with those gauntlets. Sounds good?""

""That’s perfect, ma'am!"" Seth replied, a broad smile spreading on his face. ""How long will it take?""

""I can make them right away,"" Yline answered. ""Give me two or three hours. But you’ll need to cover the cost of materials, which should be around twenty irons.”

Seth considered it for a moment. With the Black Hounds’ Endless Pouch and the weapons inside he’d have plenty enough. ""Is it okay if I go sell a few things while you craft them, so I can get the coins?""

""Sure, just come back before noon,"" Yline said, setting the recipe down. ""I have an appointment with a buyer for something else at one o’clock.""

Seth nodded and turned to leave, striding toward the door. There was no time to waste.



\*\*\*\*\*

  


Time flew by as Seth darted from shop to shop, carefully selling one or two items at a time to avoid drawing unwanted attention. As far as he could tell, his strategy paid off, and the coins steadily added up in his pouch without any strange looks or suspicion. Of all his loot, the Rare giant battle ax once wielded by the Warrior, Quill, fetched the highest price, earning him seventy iron coins on its own after the selling tax.

As he exited the tenth shop, he had managed to gain a total of five silver and seventy iron coins from all his sales—including the forty irons he’d just spent to buy a cheap-but-quite-useful spell from the Adventurers Guild’s Iron shop.

Seth glanced one more time at the scroll to cast Identify before putting it into his Endless Pouch.

**Intermediate Identify** (Standard)

*Upgrading spell-scroll*

Tier: Iron                      Affinity: -

Grade: Common

Restrictions: 

\- Identify

As he walked back to the Champions of Chaos headquarters, Seth took out his communication orb and infused aether inside.

*Seth: I should make it on time for my fight. Anything important I should know? Do I have to wear my training suit, or is gear allowed?*

Less than a minute later, words appeared within the crystal orb.

*Elena: What do you mean you* '*should*' *? The night caravans arrived at seven…*

*Elena: Armors and weapons are allowed for the fight, but artifacts aren’t. You can just wear your academy’s uniform if you don't have better armor.*

*Elena: Oh, and they also added a new rule this morning: no contracted beast.*

'*Those filthy nobles,*' Nightmare growled inside the beastholder. '*They don't want me to tear apart their kin.*'

'*It's fine,*' Seth said, already knowing something like that could happen. '*I'll win even without you.*'

*Seth: Thanks for the heads up.*

*Elena: You’re welcome.*

Slipping the orb into his pocket, Seth sighed and kept walking.  Without Nightmare, going up against Iron nobles loaded with Epic-grade gear and spells would be tough. However, since everyone would know about his subclass through Identify and assumed he’d gained a Revelation, there was no reason to also hold back on using Share*.* He’d just have to lie a little about its effects, so it wouldn’t draw too much attention. 

As Seth stepped inside the Champions of Chaos’ headquarters, he found Yline at her anvil, hammering what seemed to be a sword, and Toren hunched over his workbench, tinkering with a small metallic orb which was the size of his hand.

The moment Yline spotted Seth, she grinned. ""You're late, kid. I finished ten minutes ago,"" she said proudly, setting down her hammer and reaching for a pair of reinforced gauntlets. 

Seth's eyes lit up as the woman handed them to him. His fingers ran over the dark, rune-etched leather, feeling the solid metal core beneath. The design was simple, but their durability was certainly not lacking. Like his father’s, the protective plating extended from mid-forearm to the knuckles, offering unparalleled defense at the cost of nearly no wrist mobility.

Without wasting even a second, Seth cast Identify*.*

**Black Steel Gauntlets**

*Weapon*

Tier: Iron

Grade: Common

Effects:

\- Ignores 4% of Toughness.

\- Increases Toughness by 3%.

\- Reduces aether cost by 5% for any spells.

""Thank you, ma'am,"" Seth said, his voice filled with gratitude as he took out the twenty iron coins. 

Even if the prototype was only Common-grade, it would still give him the chance to test the weapon’s fighting style—and that was what mattered.

Yline nodded toward her workbench. ""Just put them over there, next to your recipe.""

Seth placed the coins beside the piece of parchment, then turned back to the blacksmith. ""If I manage to gather all the resources for the real one, how much would you charge me to craft them?""

Yline wiped her hands on her apron, thinking for a moment. ""Since you're one of us, you get the sixty-percent discount. So…about fifty irons.""

A smile spread on Seth’s face—it would leave him enough to buy a new Primalist Iron spell. ""Really? That's amazing, thank you, ma'am!""

""Don't get too excited."" Yline’s mouth twisted to the side, and her expression turned more serious. ""There’s one ingredient I’m not even sure you’ll be able to find.""

""Which one?""

""The Desert Snake’s beaststone,"" the blacksmith answered. ""As far as I know, it can only be found in a specific overgrown Iron Rift. Most adventurers gave up on crafting equipment with that stone in the recipe.""

Seth frowned. ""An overgrown Rift? What’s that""

""A Rift with higher-Tier beasts inside,"" Toren said from behind them. ""Like, an Iron Rift with Silver and Gold beasts inside.""

""People also call them dead Rifts,"" Yline added. ""For obvious reasons.""

""How is that even possible?"" Seth asked, trying to recall the theory he had seen about Rifts. ""Wouldn’t that go against the arcane laws?""

""Not exactly,"" Toren answered, leaning back. ""See, it's different stepping into a lower-Tier Rift than being inside one. There's this famous Scholar, Eldric, who came up with a theory about aether being kinda like water. Plunge your hand inside it slowly, it goes through easily. But slap it real fast and it's like hitting a stone. Same idea. When you break through while inside the Rift, your aether doesn't just slam into the Rift's as if you were just walking in. It takes a few seconds to, uh, adjust, and that’s why you won’t just drop dead on the spot.""

""I see,"" Seth muttered, realizing that the additional attributes' from Link could be a huge advantage in those Rifts, since he could be at the appropriate Tier yet stronger than a normal Wielder would be. ""Thank you."" 

""No problem, kid."" 

Seth then turned back to Yline. ""Do you remember the name of that overgrown Rift, ma'am?""

The blacksmith scratched her cheek, thinking for a brief moment before answering, ""I believe it’s called the Desert of Misery.""

You just have to look at a coffee shop bulletin board or check the social media of the MANY venues we have. There is CONSTANT events happening throughout the city that are free.

A real boring city is where Walmart is the most interesting place to be, we have SO MUCH. There’s so much possibility, community, and beauty here. If we keep waiting for someone else to make it more interesting and more exciting for ourselves we are going miss out and what we already have.

1opo6zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschooluk/comments/1opo6zk/my_advice_for_placement_as_a_final_year/,My Advice for Placement (as a Final Year),"Disclaimer: Take everything with a heavy pinch of salt, I am not a genius, talented at procedures or even that funny! (According to my family). Am also typing this at \~1am and hyperbolic.

**Tldr: placement can be pretty crap at first but if yk how to get more out of it, it's a much better use of your time. I put the main points in Bold because this is an essay and half f\*\*\*\*\* hell.**

***Most important part: Wherever you are, take time to learn the science behind what you're seeing. Mechanism, Pathophysiology, Imaging of what you're seeing and why. Keep building on your 1st/2nd year knowledge and if you didn't learn something then, learn it now! Don't let the knowledge rot away, build!***

So, most of us know it, and if you've just started 3rd year you're finding out. Placement (& GP/others) is mostly a s\*\*\* show. No one knows or expects you, timetables a mess, can't log on to most computers to check anything, bunch of useless logbook stuff and alot of unis just decide past 3rd year you can buy passmed and teach yourself everything (I mean you can but where is my 9k going, at least give me some coffee). And this is not even talking about my commute 🏊

So, if you go in blind (dw most people do) you quickly feel like it's a waste of time and begin bunking just enough to pass placement and cramming passmed in last couple months. It's a strat.

However if you wanna go in, here's some things to know

**WARD ROUND** 

**Summary: Clerk a Patient before WR and present to consultant/reg. Ask the F1 to show you Bloods/Past Notes/Scans beforehand.**

Honestly, the most useless thing for a med student to do. Get given a handover sheet with patients you've never seen, bunch of pathologies in abbreviations you have no idea wtf stand for yet, Niche specialty stuff flying over your head between reg and/or consultant, bunch of standing and feeling like your legs are gonna fall off then ending it with a quick roll eyes from consultant who thinks there's too many people shadowing WR (sometimes fair point but it's not your fault is it).

HOWEVER, it's obligatory to do atleast one of these per rotation so everyone (especially your consultant supervisor who will sign you off at end) sees your face. Also makes juniors like F1/SHO more likely to tell you about interesting stuff to do if they see you.

If I was to go in now for one I'd do the following. Go in really early (7am - I know but you chose to go WR instead of sleeping in!) and find the first junior/F1 that shows up. Ask (? beg) for them to show you just one patient's notes, ideally one not already set for discharge, and let you flick through before they start prepping. Note down all the relevant Bloods, look through the Drug Charts, Progress Notes, look at the PLAN from the night team in particular, try to think about what needs to be done TODAY, what could be an issue. Try and put everything in context.

Then go out and see the patient before WR starts. Take a full relevant history, do a full physical exam (cardio, resp, abdominal etc as much as you can) and ask to present your history to reg/consultant/team before they go see them at bedside.

As a side note, I say go super early because alot of med schools are like yeah you're not allowed to logon to any computer thanks. And then all the info you have is what the patient who's woken up at 6am knows, which is normally not the medications their on, not their recent procedures or bloods and sometimes not even knowing the reason theyre in! (Poor job from everyone else there). Try to understand everything in context, try to think what the consultant wants to know today or be updated on, think about the issues overnight also particularly going into your history. But dw, you're also here to learn, do your best, note what you miss, just give it a go.

Rest of the WR just note down stuff that gets said that you don't understand. An interesting condition, something you remember from passmed. Go look it up after if you want to, or not, you woke up early after all🌚, get a couple sign offs and you can go home if you want, no one gives a rats \*\*\*

**THEATRES** 

**Summary: These ppl are intense, do what you can, be early, try not to p anyone off too much.**

Okay full disclosure I'm not a surgery bro so I may be crucified for my advice.

Theatres is a pretty intense place honestly. Depends on the team yes but for the most part surgeons are intense. They also love to tear med students open a new one. They love to tear everyone a new one, I guess that's why they're surgeons 😎 So be PREPARED when you walk in there.

Its good if you can, to go the day before to theatres and ask about the list of cases the next day. Biggest thing you wanna study the night before is your anatomy. I know you think you know anatomy from your flashcards in first year but surgeons live and breathe this stuff. Study it as much as you can, look at cadaveric images/prosecutions and briefly look into the procedures also. ALSO (big one), see if you can find out your glove size and/or ask one of the assistants to show you how to scrub in. Things will be much less pressurized when they're not in the middle of a case and you'll need to know your glove size to scrub in.

Number one rule is be on time (early if you can because I always used to get lost). I used to show up around 7:15ish (when I came) but it varies. They'll normally be in handover ask someone where that is and make your way there. After handover finishes, introduce yourself to consultant and/or reg, dw if they don't care you've done your bit. And then basically follow the team.

At some point you'll end up in theatres and will need to scrub in. Again follow someones instructions if it's the first few times and once your sterile, do not touch ANYTHING. Then just follow the surgeons lead. I would actually go theatres a few times in a week the first time you go, the issue with med school is sometimes your time in theatres is so spaced out that you basically end up forgetting/getting timid on how to scrub by the time the next one rolls up. Do them a few times till you can do them in your sleep. Then never again 🌚

Word of warning, surgeons grill (Americans would say pimp). It's what they do I'm sorry. You will be sweating and standing in that theatre for hours and that surgeon is gonna tear you a new one mentally and emotionally. Yes I'm sorry I can't describe actinic keratoses. Yes I'm sorry idk what artery I'm looking at. Yes I'm sorry my mask is slipping off (DONT TOUCH IT! ask a sister/assistant to push it up for you). Yes I'm sorry I went to med school. If you wanna do surgery, you'll think of this as building character, and growing thick skin. If you Don't, maybe you'll reconsider coming theatres 😉.

But jokes aside, don't take stuff to heart. If it's your first time dealing with surgeons and you meet a real nasty bugger who basically eviscerates all your self esteem, don't be afraid to have the rest of the day to yourself. I cried in the toilet once after a plastic surgeon went after me for not reading their 100 page booklet the night before, I don't regret crying though, I just regret never touching derm again till a week before exams (trauma 😎). Learn what you can, leave the rest of the bs that comes with theatres. You're there to learn, not impress anyone.

BLOODS/CANNULAS/ABGS/JOBS Summary: Go to the right ward/area to do which procedure you wanna do.

Soo, procedures. I'll start by saying if all you want is sign offs, talk to the F1, do a few and you're sorted. Go home and sleep.

BUT, if you actually wanna practice, yk for when you're the only F1 on call being asked to do 30 cannulas, make sure you go to somewhere where these jobs are being done constantly. I've found going to the SAU/AMU (Surgical assessment, Acute Medical Units) or any acute assessment unit really before patients are admitted, are really good for jobs. Nurses and HCAs there are pros at these jobs and can really help you, especially with bloods, cannulas etc. ABGs, ECG you may have better luck in A&E. But yeah don't waste your time on the ward in afternoons trying to get one overworked junior to supervise you, go to those units and do like 10 in a row. Do that for a week and you'll make a lot more progress. You can also clerk in those units also if that's something you're interested in!

Another thing if you really wanna get stuck in, is trying going to a couple nights with an F1 on call. Yes I know this is super sweaty and you will be exhausted next day, but you'll see so much at night. The only time I stepped foot in rhesus and did Ultrasound guided cannulas were on nights, so a couple if you can fit them in are nice. Also good to see what it's like when an F1 is on call for when it's your time.

**AFTERNOONS** 

**Summary: Go home and study most of time, but if you wanna stay find a couple stuff to do, then GO HOME. No point watching juniors write admin.**

Your timetable will often say ward work or something on wards in afternoon. Honestly I would mostly go home but if you're expected to stay, go to ward with some goals. That could be doing a couple jobs, taking a couple histories, getting a couple sign offs. Don't stress.

**TEACHING** 

this can be really good on placement, especially when held by fellows. Definitely don't skip and give feedback also since it helps the fellows. Normally they've recently completed F1/F2 so their teaching and experiences are really valuable for you. Normally a bit more relaxed about things and questions also.

**LEARNING ON PLACEMENT AND CLINICS** 

**Summary: Wherever you are, take time to learn the science behind what you're seeing. Mechanism, Pathophysiology, Imaging of what you're seeing and why. Keep building on your 1st/2nd year knowledge and if you didn't learn something then, learn it now! Don't let the knowledge rot away, build!**

Alright so bit more serious here (yes I know this post is mostly gobbledygoop). There's different kinds of learning you can do during your placement.

Obviously there's passmed, guidelines, osce skills, procedures maybe and basically stuff for your exams/being an F1. And that stuff you have to do anyway.

But then there's actual medicine. And when I say that I mean the underlying science behind what you're doing. Let me give an example - when you see a patient with Raised ACE, swelling parotids, Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy and Hypercalcemia, what are you thinking? Pregnancy right? 😀😀 (Pregnancy of the lungs aka Sarcoidosis). But why do you get hypercalcemia in Sarcoidosis? If you just wanna learn for passmed then don't look that up. But, if you wanna be able to answer that question one day, if you wanna understand conditions more in detail, if you wanna feel like you're applying science and not just pasting guidelines, you SHOULD look up, learn and retain the science behind the conditions you learn. The pathology, the mechanisms, the anatomy/physiology, What's actually going on.

And when I say learn the science behind things I mean don't just gloss over them, or go based off what you learn 1st/2nd year. Hypercalcemia in Sarcoidosis? Okay it's because Macrophages activating 1-Alpha Hydroxylase and that increasing conversion into active vitamin d, but don't just learn this, learn the full metabolism of vitamin D, the effect of PTH, other factors that stimulate/inhibit vitamin d production. Think further also, how would you treat Hypercalcemia, why does that medication work? What's the mechanism of say Bisphosphonates, Denosumab, other drugs etc etc. extrapolate your learning, this js what's gonna actually help you.

And yes I know this is extra work on top of preparing for exams but this scientific knowledge will help you later down the line, even If you don't retain it all at the top of your tongue. The sciences is the backbone behind medicine after all. So really try to dig deep into topics that you see in the hospital, not just what you need for passmed.

If you come at placement with this mentality, then really any specialty and any experience can be valuable, because if you write down the conditions that you're seeing, this is material you can go away and study. Terbutaline? What's their mechanism? Anti phospholipid syndrome? What's going on here? Which antibodies are produced and why, why does this affect clotting, why does this cause recurrent miscarriages? Parkinson's Disease, what does Levodopa do? Why did the psychiatrist give a FGA and not a SGA? What's the difference? Why why why? What's the scientific understanding behind all of this? If you come at it from this angle, you'll pick up a whole load more knowledge (but it takes studying outside passmed🤫), but imo it's worth it.

Clinics can be a bit specialised and in depth. But again come at them from the science angle, use everything as a springboard to go and learn more about medicine. Urology Clinics? Learn the mechanism of PDE inhibitors. Breast Clinics? Learn breast anatomy in depth. Dementia clinics? Learn about the proteinopathies and why they test for certain ones in LP biomarkers. Lesrn the mechanism of medications always. Yes this is extra work but again imo it's valuable.

Resources are good also for finding topics to learn and study when there's downtime or you're not doing much on placement. Oxford handbook is good imo but so many others to choose, bring your laptop/iPad to wards and study when nothing's going on.

**Essay over, time to sleep. If anyone has questions lmk and I'll answer as I can. Take the post with a BIG pinch of salt and remember this is just another student talking, wtf do they know. Did they also get a 7 in history, I dont think so😎 No one is perfect, fake it till you make it, most ppl bunk, just gimme my degree and never ending loan.**",3,1762399499.0,medicalschooluk,0,1.0,False

When I was leaving, I got a bit turned around and asked this girl where the train station was. She said, “Just come with me, I’m heading there too.” She’s also volunteering at the same event, but only on Saturday, while I’ll be there both Saturday and Sunday.

While we were heading there we started to talk the usual questions like where we’re from and what we’re studying. We’re both relatively new to the country, she’s been here for about a year and I’ve only been here three months.

On the train, the conversation just flowed. We talked about movies, music, hobbies, books…  she seemed genuinely interested, asking questions and engaging in everything we talked about. I really felt a connection.

We got off at the same stop. She was waiting for a friend to go to dinner, I was starving too, so I grabbed a quick burger nearby. Before leaving, I said goodbye and told her I’d see her on Saturday, but as soon as I walked away, I regretted not asking for her contact.

So I went back, found her again and asked if she’d be okay if we keep the contact. She smiled, asked if I had Instagram and followed me right there.

Now I just can’t stop thinking about her. I know she’s stressed at the moment with a lot of  exams, so I don’t want to come across as intrusive, but part of me really wants to reach out. I was thinking of sending something simple like, ""Hey, I really enjoyed meeting you today, you’ve got great energy.” Maybe even ask if she’d like to grab a coffee sometime.

I just don’t know if it’s better to message her now or wait until Saturday when I see her again. Either way, she’s been on my mind since I left.",2,1762399396.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

TL:DR
Cafelat Robot or flair 58 as a long term machine 

Hey guys, i’m looking to upgrade from my flair neo flex for a more long term machine.To give some context I’ve had a flair neo flex for about a year and I’ve been feeling like i want to upgrade to streamline my workflow and just to have more brewing options to mess around with. 

I mostly drink anywhere from medium light to dark roast coffee and I have a kingrinder k6. I don’t really care about milk drinks and i’ve been having fun with the lever so obviously i’m considering the flair 58 and the cafelat robot. I’m mostly interested in hearing how the workflow is for those of you who have either. 

I’m not too worried about temp management on either but I do know that the flair seems better for temp management overall. I like the design of both, hate the temperature wire on the flair but prefer the 58mm portafilter for more customization like messing around with stepped baskets. I feel like i’m leaning more towards the flair based on overall versatility and the end of year sale going on but I want to know if you guys feel like there’s plenty of fun to be had and whether the robot feels like a better value proposition especially since it’s a bit cheaper. 

I’d also love to hear how both machines have held up over time and whether they’ve kept up with your changing tastes. Honestly i’ll take any other information you might feel is relevant when making this decision because this has kinda been an agonizing decision. In a perfect world I would have both…

I'm going a start a review series of some the k-dramas in this subreddit. Already, I have done quite a few reviews in another subreddit **'r/kdramas**' (you can check in my profile), and I want to share these reviews, along with the ones that will come in future. So today, I'm going to review 'Something in the Rain'. Hope you would like this review of mine and continue to support in future. So, here we go :

K-dramas and romance - these two words are enough to attract a person's attention and make him/her engage for a whole. There have been many great romantic k-dramas released over the years, some stayed in the hearts of viewers, and some made them cry. From the peak romance of **'Crash Landing on You'**(2019), to the heartbreaking trauma of '**Uncontrollably Fond**'(2016) and to the OG **Coffee Prince (2007)**, we have seen more of romance full of purity from these dramas than an American drama or an Indian drama. However, there is one drama that literally created buzz on its release but has been under the radar for quite a while. It's '**Something in the rain' (2018)** and from this post, I want to request you all to try this because, even if it is not ranked higher or suggested (kind of being underrated), there is beauty in this drama that you would not want to miss.

Released in 2018, '**Something in the rain**' is a drama of two people of differences - both in age and family life status - who fall in love. Heard before? Yes. So, what's new? Nothing. It just reinvigorates the true meaning of love and gives a new dimension to age-gap romance, which was explored very rarely (I'm not talking about **Goblin**, that's another level). There is poetry in the form of love between the lead couple, which has the ability to melt anybody's heart. There are also two side stories-tension within FL's family about the relationship and the sexual harassment cases in the company where FL works- that keeps the drama very much engaging. The makers have done a very good job in ensuring the balance between all the stories while maintaining the main essence of this drama. TBH, I'm very much impressed with the way it makes the viewer relate with real-life

In terms of cast performance, this drama hits it right into the slot. Son Ye-Jin and **Jung Hae-In**, as **Yoo-Jin Ah** and **Seo Joon-Hee** (that's what was written in subtitles), were completely mesmerizing as a couple. Romance only works when the chemistry between the leads work, and both of them not only perfected their chemistry, their romance was so real that for once I thought that they had also in fallen in love off the set (no pun intended). The love and respect they showed for each other, struggles they faced in their relationship - everything looked real and not half-baked and showed that sometimes, age-gap romance works. This drama proved to be a boon for both **Son Ye-Jin**, who experienced a resurgence in her golden career, and **Jung Hae-In**, who literally improved his skills from **'While you were sleeping**'(2017) and continued to star in hit dramas as a lead. The supporting cast, led by the experienced **Jang So Yeon**, were outstanding for most of the time, but they sometimes got overboard in terms of reacting to certain situations, which looked weird. Still, no issues in the acting department.

The OST is pretty much laid back, as only the title track of this drama and some of background music sounded good. But I had more expectations. The cinematography is, however, very much real and at times, beautiful to watch. The way the scenes were filmed, it was like watching al these live.

Overall, it's **9/10** for me. Except some of the overdramatic workplace scenes and the fact that it could have been a 20-episode drama to flesh out the story even further, I think it's a very, very good drama to watch with your partner.",1,1762399280.0,Korean_Drama_Hangout,0,1.0,False
1opo447,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1opo447/help_me_before_living_with_my_friend_ruins_our/,Help me before living with my friend ruins our friendship!,"Myself (F22) and Stacey (21F) (real name changed for privacy) moved into an apartment in August of 2024, and it has been non-stop problems since about 4 months in. When we first moved in together, everything was fine. We split chores evenly and were on pretty different schedules, and barely saw each other. We'd have movie nights and take turns making dinner. It was a lot of fun, but now everything is different. We first started having bumps around December when I found out she was complaining to our coworkers (we used to work together until she quit in August 2025)about me leaving my dishes in the sink or not taking out the trash. I didn't confront her, just slowly made those changes because I was busy with school and letting a lot in my personal life go to trash. But the part that frustrated me was that she would and still does leave her stuff everywhere. Cups on the coffee table, plates on the couch, and empty pop bottles sitting on the dining room table, I don't say anything, just pick them out and go on with my day. 

Now we get to the real issue. In May 2025, I started dating Eric (not real name), and it's been going amazingly. He still lives with his mom, so we tend to hang out at my place, but we're not just here all the time; we'll go to dinner or do little date nights. Back in January, I made a rule that if we were bringing random guys back to the apartment, we had to let the other know for safety reasons. Like if she's having some Tinder dude over, I want to make sure my keys, purse, and checkbook are in my room with me, and she agreed. Now it feels like she keeps throwing the rule back at me. After Eric and I had been dating for a month or so, she'd occasionally say things like ""Just let me know if he's gonna be here,"" ""I feel like I can't be in the living room if he's here,"" and I took all of that into consideration. But now we've been offically girlfriend and boyfriend for 2 months and seeing each other for around 6, so he's not just a rando. Most recently, she's been giving me the silent treatment because our friend group went out for Halloweekend and we all got super drunk, and when her, myself, and Eric got home, she could hear us having sex (which was a constant complaint, but now we turn the TV up really loud so she isn't bothered). Eric always comes over on Tuesday nights to watch our show with Stacey and me, and she's even asked where he was when he didn't come one week. This Tuesday, I made us all dinner and even texted her that I was going to make dinner. She said, ""Thank you, that sounds yummy!"" When she got home late from work, Eric and I were already eating and the kitchen table, and she took one look at us and stormed into her room. When she came out, she left the apartment and said she was going to our mutual friends' apartment to study. She didn't even eat the dinner that she said she was excited for. 

I work with that mutual friend, and today (Wednesday) she told me that Stacey was complaining about me not telling her that Eric was gonna be there, and that Stacey always complains about it to her, and that for her sake, I need to start being better about telling her when my boyfriend is going to be over. I'm really over her bullshit, and this is just one problem on a long list. I pay half the rent, and I take care of the apartment as a whole. I deserve a bit more respect, and stop making my boyfriend feel weird about being here.

Any advice? I'm not confrontational, which is a large reason I keep walking on eggshells around her.",1,1762399267.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

Perineum as well. I went home later that day. I made sure to pee often, eat, take stool softeners like directed. 2 days post op I started feeling a lot of pressure and it did make me cry, thought I was going to have a bowel movement. I called my surgeon who told me take miralax (i did) dont strain, more fluids etc, okay.

With this, I also do suffer from constipation. Which also obviously contributed to the pop (and having a big baby, wound up a code etc) 
I also have hemorrhoids, have had them for a long time.

Now, Friday (halloween) I finally felt like I needed to use the bathroom. So I did things I thought I should (how to sit, breathe, squatty potty. This is where things went bad. 

The urge to bear down and push took over and it had no control over it. I tried. I did wind up passing some stool (not a ton). One of them felt like it got stuck so I had some gloves to help remove it a little (i did not or i dont think i went all crazy over this, just trying to get past the rectum. It hurt. I knew some pain would be involved but it got worse from there. There was a LOT of pain. I put pressure on my rectum because that was the only thing that eased the pain very slight. That pain did not go away it just got worse.

Wound up calling 911, being taken out of my house in crying sobbing pain. It really was that bad. The paramedic gave me 3 different injections of dulidad (took 45ish minutes to my nearest emergency room) the pain was barely able to be dealt with in the ER until a few hours later. I was taken in to CT, mri, my hospital stay was 5 days. I was no food by mouth for 2? Of those days. Then slight soft foods, has to transfer hospitals, put back on NPO then got actual solid food since Friday (this was Tuesday)

I guess there was a large hematoma against the vaginal wall. Free fluid etc. It has since shrunk in size...

I was released to come home today. I have not had a bowel movement since that friday (5days) im home but I am absolutely terrified to have a bowel movement. To the point I'm having little panic attacks. Im trying not to push at all, strain, etc. Ive upped my fluids, eating fruits and veggies, had some coffee. Last night the nurse gave me a senna tablet. I was scared to take it but I did.  Nothing. Took milk of magnesia when I got home...still nothing. Urges to push and some pressure, but nothing so far. Im scared. I am absolutely terrified. I have sat on the toulet crying and begging to who knows to please dont make it hurt and just come out and go already. Then I start thinking what happens if I cant, what happens if I cant ever go normally again. I hate this. I absolutely hate it. I am losing it over this. Im trying to do everything I can to make it go smoothly but I am so scared. 

I need guidance, help, know that I'm not alone with feeling this way. Tips, pointers etc. Im terrified, my anxiety is through the roof, im laying in bed right now just idk. I do have an enema and ducolax laxative but I'm scared. Im absolutely scared. I walk a little, I rest, I eat some, I drink, take my meds and my anxiety is getting worse. I do NOT want to feel that pain again, go through the hell i did in the hospital for 5 days, pain meds, catheter, constant blood draws, 911 or ambulance ride to the hospital.

Lately, I’ve been spending more time alone  not because I lost friends or anything dramatic, but because life just kind of slowed down. A few weeks ago, I went for a walk without headphones for the first time in ages. No music, no podcasts , just me, the sounds of the street, and my thoughts.

At first, it felt awkward. I kept reaching for my phone out of habit. But after a while, I noticed the wind, the laughter from people passing by, even the way the light hit the pavement. It sounds small, but it made me realize how much of life I’ve been rushing through without noticing.

Now I try to make time for these little moments ,sitting with my morning coffee in silence, taking a short walk after work, or even cooking something new without multitasking. It’s not glamorous, but it’s been grounding.

Does anyone else find peace in doing simple things alone? What’s your version of that?

1opny8p,https://i.redd.it/zagwmkinljzf1.jpeg,The trial of Maplestory Big Bang 2.0 begins today!,"People of the Maplestory, I have gathered you all here today because Nexon has created a paradox with MS Classic and I want to help unravel the twisted web that MS Classic has become. You may ask, ""What does this have to do with me?"" I assume that everyone here must like at least one thing about Maplestory. Now imagine if in the future you wanted to preserve that one thing but something goes wrong. Without a doubt, many people would want to bring it to someone's attention. But that is only the beginning, what if the thing in question was a sacred landmark and a company put a Coffee shop into it?

Alright then while Nexon is not an historical organization you can sort of get the idea from that example. A comparison I can think of is that MS Classic World is a lot like something that was set up special by the Joker in order to get Batman. There are other theories that somewhat go in a similar direction: (In all of these cases, none of them are pointing at any one single person, they are only just examples)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvdcmHZTzlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvdcmHZTzlU)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSrSAIo4S1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSrSAIo4S1I)

So you might be wondering, where am I going with this? Lets go back to the day of the MapleCon Live stream. I recall thinking that things were going to be different after this. ""From now on if someone talks bad about Nexon then I might have to try and defend the company"". Then I watched the stream and afterwards I did feel a little disappointed but also some interest in MS Classic world. Now if I only had an interest in Pre Big bang Maplestory then the story might end here with disappointment. However after talking with people in various places, it reminded me of something else: I LIKED BIG BANG TOO.

Having remembered that I was indeed active during the Big Bang times, I could take a good look at what MS Classic world presented so far. Some of you younger players may not have been around in those days but suddenly the Maple world that we knew changed. Some how we all survived but the game was different forever.

Finally coming back to the present, I see skill changes and map changes and that sounds just like what another Big bang might be like. But here is the paradox and they named it MS Classic World. If Nexon wanted to do a MS Classic then I would suggest that they split it off and tackle that topic separately. (because MS Classic World is closer to something else I have in mind) Because once you start making big changes like have been seen, that game is not comparing to Old MS anymore, its comparing to Big Bang.

In other words, if the game is going to do changes then we might as well go all out. Maybe reorganize many of the maps, mobs and EXP. Quests could be revamped, etc. From this perspective then the current changes do not go far enough. Welcome friends, to Big Bang 2.0!

**TL DR:**

So that is the truth of the matter as I can see it. ""Classic"" MS would be something with few alterations. (game of the past) While you could make changes to it, when is it still that and when does it become something else? Big bang is all about change and a much better description in a lot of ways. At the end of the day I am just one player from the Pre Big bang days, sharing my point of view. If any of that made sense to you then I am glad. And I can repeat this part: ""Is MS Classic World ""Classic""?"" My response would be a shrug. Is ""MS classic World worth playing?"" Maybe probably..",0,1762398799.0,Maplestory,5,0.08,False

I've seen my fair share of the ""real world"" and would like to do everyone a favor and not participate in this rat race of a capital machine. I'm not leaving as a reaction but rather as a solution. I'm going to work on myself and come back as a tool to be and make a difference in society which seems to be heading to bleakness.

I've been meticulously planning for the past 2 years and will be executing it in the fall of 2026.

Now getting to the main part, I would love some peer review on my plans, I would appreciate it if you really get me thinking on possible flaws in my plans. here goes:

I'll be heading close to the Himalayan mountain range in India or Nepal, living within 30 minutes to a developed town with all the major facilities I'd need like food, electricity and hospitals. 

I'll be working from tent with Starlink Roam Satellite WiFi with a battery power station and solar. My plan is to create an entirely online business using virtual offices, virtual addresses and online communication. As a side hustle I'll be creating various videos for online platforms. The ultimate goal of this being to create a system to make money without having to think about it which would take care of my basic survival. 

Apart from money I'd love to create something beautiful for this world, be it a product, service or whatever else that could makes this world a tiny bit better than it is.

Other than my career, I'll be working on myself spiritually, psychologically and physically to ultimately become a selfless tool to do whatsoever the world may need at that time.   
  
I believe that I'll also be finding the love of my life along my journey and be getting married along the high-ways. (No kids whatsoever) 

Details:

I'll have funds to live for 10 years without any stream of income + I'll be maxing out all my credit cards to buy my motorcycle and all gear. So I'm not trying to be minimal, I'll take any luxury that a motorcycle can hold as it's gonna be my home for years. 

Starting off with my motorcycle, it'll be the [Royal Enfield Himalayan 450](https://www.royalenfield.com/us/en/motorcycles/himalayan-450/) with all the upgrades (wider wind shield, hand guards, engine guard, off-road wheels...). There's no other motorcycle I'd choose, it's got everything I need. Repairs are gonna be easy too since RE has service centers basically all across the Himalayas. 

For storage and tent I'm picking [Lone Rider's Combo 1 – Travel the World](https://www.lonerider-motorcycle.com/collections/luggage/products/combo-1-travel-the-world?variant=40782093713523).

I'll mostly be traveling all across the Indian subcontinent along my journey hoping to find experiences that make me the perfect tool for an unforeseeable future, I trust nature to give me all that will be necessary.

1opnrgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1opnrgw/i_left_reality_it_followed_behind_part_1/,"I Left Reality, It Followed Behind (PART 1)","I don't remember falling asleep.

In fact, I don't recall a before at all.

There's no dream trailing behind me, no fog of waking. Just… here. Awareness popping into existence like a light flicking on in an empty room.

I'm lying on something firm. Sheets underneath me feel slightly rough, hospital-like, but not cold. More like a bed that's been cleaned too many times, washed until softness forgot how to exist. There's a faint hum in the air-low, steady, like a building breathing, or electricity thinking quietly to itself.

I blink once.

Twice.

The ceiling above me is colorless. Not white or gray, more like the idea of a ceiling before paint and texture get assigned. My mind tries to name the shade and fails. That scares me more than waking up somewhere unfamiliar.

Names should come easy.

I sit up slowly, and my muscles do what I tell them, but they feel… preloaded, like someone assembled me a moment ago and tightened all the bolts. Not painful, just new. Break-in stiffness.

The room is square. Too clean. Too symmetrical. The air doesn't smell like air. No dust. No leftover scents of life. Just sterile neutrality.

There's a door set into the far wall. Smooth. Metallic. No handle. Like it was built to be a door only in shape, not in function.

I wait for my brain to supply context — anything. A memory. A feeling. A name.

Nothing comes.

I touch my face. My cheek feels like skin. Warm, familiar. My hair brushes my forehead; it feels real too. So does my heartbeat — steady, calm, undeservedly calm. The clinical part of my mind, a part I don't remember learning, notes the normal rhythm.

If I had a name, I would say it out loud now, just to anchor myself.

Instead, I whisper into the room:

“Hello?”

My voice sounds rusted, like a door hinge unused for years. The sound doesn't echo off the walls; it is absorbed. The silence is back too quickly, sealed shut like a vacuum.

And then… something shifts.

Not physically. Not visually. More like the atmosphere exhales. A subtle release of tension I didn’t know was there. A presence, not entering, not appearing — just deciding to become noticed.

I slowly turn my head.

There's someone — something — standing near the corner.

No, not standing. Approximating standing.

At first glance, it's vaguely human-shaped. Two arms. Two legs. A torso. A suggestion of a head. But the edges waver like heat shimmer rising from asphalt. The proportions keep correcting themselves, like reality trying to remember how a body is supposed to look.

It isn’t threatening.

It isn’t comforting.

It is simply… existing wrong.

Or I am.

I don't scream. I don't run. A strange acceptance settles over me, like my emotions are lagging behind events, buffering. There is something in me that recognizes this not-person shape before thought catches up. A familiarity without context.

“I… know you,” I whisper, for reasons I'm not aware of.

The shape twitches, like a glitch smoothing itself out. The room brightens half a shade, then returns to neutral. No movement. No wind. Just a subtle adjustment, as if the world responded to the idea of me recognizing something.

It doesn't speak, but the air hums differently.

I swallow. My throat feels dry despite never feeling thirsty.

“What is this place?”

The shape leans, but the gesture is a translation error-like the concept of leaning, filtered through a language that has no verb for it. The space around it bends a fraction. The hum in the walls syncs with my pulse. Or my pulse syncs with it.

There's a whisper in my head-not words, not a voice. Permission.

A directional nudge.

I turn towards the door.

I don't recall a decision to walk, yet my feet start moving. The closer I get, the taller the room feels. Stretching. Adjusting. Space reorganizing to fit expectation.

I lift my hand toward the smooth metal.

And the air splinters.

Not violently-like glass fracturing in slow motion, silently, elegantly. A faint shimmer opens in front of me. A ripple. A thin membrane peeling away. Reality deciding it has a doorway after all.

Behind me, the not-person shifts again.

Not pleading. Not threatening.

Observing.

I breathe once, steady and slow. My body feels like mine, but my life does not. I step through the ripple.

The room dissolves. Not disappears — dissolves. Like chalk erased from a board. The sound drops out. Light thins. My stomach rolls like I'm falling without falling.

Then—

A corridor forms around me.

Long. Narrow. Soft white light strips run along both walls, humming soft as breathing. The architecture feels somehow familiar, in the way that sometimes a dream from your childhood does. Sterile, but not institutional. Clean, but uncomfortably perfect.

Footsteps behind me would make sense, but none come.

I turn anyway.

The corridor extends behind me, too. Infinite? No. That’s not the right feeling. More like the idea of distance, waiting for measurement. Undefined until observed.

The shape is there at far end.

More defined now. Limbs cleaner. Shoulders set. A face hovering between existence and a placeholder. It does not walk-it simply exists closer whenever I stop looking directly at it. A presence following only because the narrative expects something to.

For the first time, fear flutters in me-a small bird beating wings behind my ribs. Yet fear is muffled, as if wrapped in cotton. Distant. Manageable. Almost as if the environment does not permit panic to fully bloom.

“Why am I here?” I ask.

Silence.

And then—

the corridor seems to think.

A pulse runs through the walls, faint, but unmistakable. The lights flicker like a hitched breath. Something in the air shifts pressure, as if the space itself is choosing a response.

Not-person tilts its head — and finally, sound reaches my ears:

Not a voice.

A vibration.

A low resonance, which forms meaning without forming language.

You arrived.

Not accusation. Not explanation. A statement of state. As factual as saying gravity exists.

“I didn’t choose this.”

The hum deepens.

All states are selected.

A chill goes down my spine. The corridor ahead distorts slightly, a bend appearing around where a straight line should continue. Not physically bending — conceptually bending, as if the geometry here answers to logic, not matter.

I don't know how I know this, but I suddenly feel it:

This place doesn't run on physics.

It runs on observation.

“What am I supposed to do?”

A hush descends. The lights steady themselves.

Observe.

This time, the response isn't sound; it blooms directly in my awareness, like I always knew the answer but needed to ask first to load it into existence.

Observe what?

Silence again. A patient silence. Expectant.

Ahead, the corridor gently curves left. Or maybe right. It’s adapting to my gaze. Every time I blink the perspective shifts half a degree. Not enough to startle — just enough to remind me that reality here is negotiable.

I start walking.

Not-person remains behind. Not chasing. Not guardian. Reference point. A fixed anchor so the world doesn’t float away.

I walk again, trying to summon my name. A simple syllable. A sound bonded to self. Something to cling to.

Nothing.

The hole where identity should be is clean, not traumatic. As if memory was never removed — just not loaded.

I stop.

If I concentrate, I can almost feel the shape of a name. Not the name itself — the absence has edges. Like a tooth pulled long ago but your tongue remembers its ghost.

Movement flickers in my peripheral vision. I turn.

The shape forms ahead. Not the not-person. This one is… less deliberate. More chaotic. Like a thought glitching into physicality. It flickers between forms, cycling too fast to identify: a door, a figure, a window, a smear of light, a fracture in the air.

It stabilizes into a doorway-shape.

Or rather, reality decides I expect doorways.

I approach slowly. Each step feels like it carries weight in the world's calculation. My presence narrows possibilities around me. I am not walking through space, but space is forming around my walking.

I reach the door. Frame but no handle. Rectangle of slightly brighter air.

I hesitate.

Behind me, far down the hall, not-person waits. Patient. Silent. Accepting of whatever I choose. Or perhaps indifferent. Perhaps those are the same here.

I raise my shaking hand.

Not fear.

Anticipation.

The doorway flickers - and suddenly I hear sound

A kitchen. Soft clinking. The hum of a refrigerator. A chair brushing tile. Morning light pouring through blinds. Coffee brewing.

My chest tightens.

The memory tries to surface: a warm mug, a voice, a quiet laugh, a life.

Mine?

I step closer. The image sharpens - not perfectly, like a memory slightly out of focus, filling in pieces as I look. A counter. A sink. A sun-touched floor.

Normal.

Painfully, achingly normal.

My hand almost touches the frame.

A ripple runs down the hallway as if a breath is being sharply inhaled. My skin prickles.

Behind me, the not-person hums and the sound carries shape:

If you step through, you will forget.

I freeze.

“Forget this?”

A pause.

Forget you were ever more than what is through there.

My throat closes; my heartbeat stumbles. 

The familiar scene inside the frame seems to hold its breath along with me.

A life that would feel comfortable, small, safe, and limited. 

Contained. I pull my hand back. The hum shifts-not approval, not relief. Just recalibrating the system. 

Behind me, the corridor stretches out again; endless and not endless. I don’t look back at the almost-kitchen. I don’t trust myself to.

 Instead, I take a shaky breath.

 “What am I?” 

For the first time, the not-person really focuses on me. 

The air bends around the attention like gravity thickening. The corridor stills. And a whisper, quiet as math, 

Not solved yet.

The corridor doesn't wait for me to gather myself. It shifts, almost politely, giving me space to move forward. Like the environment is saying:

*Well?*

I don't know who I am.  
I don't know where I am.  
But I know one thing now:

I chose not to disappear into a simpler life.

Even if I don’t remember choosing.

I take a step.

The ground feels too precise under my feet, like every molecule knows exactly where it belongs. No randomness. No entropy. This world doesn’t waste information. It doesn’t allow chance. It only allows outcome.

My head feels full of static, not painful but dense—like thoughts trying to remember how to be thoughts. Once, I must have lived in a world where randomness existed. Where walls didn’t breathe, and space didn’t bend politely to make room for me.

The walls pulse again. A soft, living rhythm. Not flesh—just *presence*. A quiet reminder that here, **structure is alive**, in its own distant way.

Ahead, the corridor forks.  
Left: bright, open, space stretching like a promise.  
Right: narrow, tightening, lights dimmer, air thicker.

I don’t choose. I simply look.

And the right corridor disappears.

Just softens out of existence, as though it realizes I wouldn’t walk that way and decides not to waste resources generating it. The left path remains, and I feel a faint tug—not emotional, not physical. A guidance vector. Probability narrowing.

Not a prison.  
A *calculation.*

I walk.

“What does it mean to not be solved yet?” I ask the air, or the walls, or myself.

The hum shifts.  
Not-person appears ahead this time, instead of behind—closer, clearer. Its shape keeps resolving the longer I exist near it. Bones sketch themselves beneath synthetic skin. Muscles pretend to remember anatomy. Facial features hover just shy of symmetry.

“Am I… becoming something?” I ask.

A pause. The figure tilts its head by degrees too exact to be organic.

**You are remembering how to be.**

That frightens me more than forgetting.

“How do you know me?” My voice shakes. The corridor breathes with me.

**You anchored here once.**

“When?”

**When you left.**

That makes no sense.  
And yet, deep inside my hollowed-out memory, something stirs. A shadow of familiarity. A feeling like:

*I broke something once.*  
*And the world has been holding its breath ever since.*

My knees weaken.

I reach out instinctively, hand pressing against the wall. But the wall gives—no, not gives. It *yields.* Reshapes fractionally to meet my palm and support me. Like this reality learns its shape by touching me.

I pull back quickly, unsettled.

The not-person waits patiently, inhumanly patient, like it experiences time differently here. Like it doesn’t experience time at all unless I do.

“Why do I remember nothing?”

**Memory is state-dependent.**

“State of what?”

**Form.**

I blink. Breathing feels like remembering how lungs work. Thoughts feel like scaffolding for something larger.

“Am I human?”

The shape doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, it adjusts, bones subtly lengthening then shrinking, like trying on the idea of humanity and finding it almost right but not foundational.

Finally:

**You were.**

“Was?” My throat burns. “What am I now?”

**Transitional.**

A chill ripples down my back.  
My fingers twitch like they want to curl around something familiar. A coffee mug. A doorknob. A hand. Something to hold reality steady.

The not-person — the *guide*, I realize, though guide may be too human a word — steps back. Or space steps around it. Hard to tell.

**You left the bounded solution.**  
**You returned to the field.**

“I don’t understand.”

**You will.**  
**Understanding is convergence.**

The corridor opens into a chamber. Larger than the first room. Too large — space expands as I notice it, like someone keeps dragging the walls with invisible rulers.

In the center floats something impossible to ignore:

A sphere.  
Or not a sphere — a point of potential masquerading as one, shimmering with all the shapes it could be and none it must settle on.

It pulses softly, heartbeat-like, but not biological. More like calculation cycles. Reality ticks.

I step closer. I don’t decide to; my body just goes, drawn by a pull older than my memory.

“What is that?”

**Origin.**

“Origin of what?”

The walls dim, as though to emphasize the answer.

**State.**

The sphere flickers — not light, not shadow. Information rippling.

I feel something.

Not deja vu — deeper. A remembering beneath thought. My bones feel warm. My skin tingles. There is a gravity here, not physical but conceptual. Like I belong to this object. Or it belongs to me.

I whisper, without knowing why:

“Is that… me?”

**It is where your solution began to diverge.**

My heart stutters. “Diverge from what?”

**Continuity.**

I reach out — then stop. Touching would commit something. Collapse possibilities. My fingers hover in trembling air.

“I left this place before?”

**Yes.**

“Why can’t I remember?”

**Memory cannot cross boundaries when identity is uncollapsed.**

It hurts in a way pain doesn’t usually hurt. A grief with no object. A feeling like I lost myself across dimensions, and what woke up here is only the echo remembering it once was whole.

“What was I?”

**A constant.**  
**Then a variable.**

“I don’t know what that means.”

**You will.**

I look at the sphere again. It hums, subtle and infinite, like everything that ever was, compressed into a single pending decision.

“Was I human out there?”

**You approximated one.**  
**Well.**

There’s something like melancholy in the statement. Or maybe I’m projecting. Hard to tell in a place where emotion doesn’t adhere unless you press hard enough.

The air breaks softly — a ripple — and suddenly the sphere changes.

Not shape. Not form.  
**Meaning.**

Images flash around me, faint like reflections in glass:

A living room.  
A window, rain sliding down.  
A person sitting at a table, holding a mug.  
A lamp’s warm glow.  
Comfort. Mundanity. Mortality.

A life.  
A *small*, human life.

Mine.

I reach toward the image as if my hand could slip through reality and touch the lip of that mug. Feel its warmth. Feel ownership of something so simple.

The moment my fingertips graze that image:

The entire chamber inhales.

The walls pull inward.  
The floor ripples.  
The sphere blazes with possibility.

A voice — not a voice — fills me:

**Choose.**

The familiar room sharpens. I see my own hand lifting the mug. Sunlight on skin. Breath fogging slightly in morning air.

I could go back.

I could forget this place.  
Forget the pressure of infinite reality.  
Forget being unsolved.  
Forget being anything but human.

I whisper, broken:

“I miss it.”

I’m not sure if I miss the life itself or the *shape* of life. The certainty. The boundaries. The comfort of not being able to think beyond a mortal frame.

But then another feeling rises — slow, reluctant, terrifying:

Curiosity.

What am I here?  
What was I before I chose to forget?  
What could I become if I don’t run?

I lower my hand.

“My life there… would it be real?”

**Real enough.**  
**Until you wonder again.**

That’s worse than a lie.  
That’s kindness with teeth.

I take a step back from the sphere.

Not-person becomes clearer again, watching. Always watching. Waiting to see what equations I snap into place by existing.

“Tell me what I am now.”

It doesn’t hesitate.

**Incomplete.**

Something in me cracks — not breaks.  
Opens.

“I don’t know if I want this.”

**Wanting is a property of bounded forms.**  
**You are not bounded.**

I laugh. It comes out raw and hollow.

“I feel very bounded.”

**You feel memory of boundaries.**  
**Not boundaries.**

The sphere pulses softly, less urging now, more like acknowledgment. This is not a test. I was never being tested.

Tests imply something cares whether you pass.

I swallow hard.

“What happens next?”

**You observe.**  
**You collapse possibilities.**  
**You converge.**

“Into what?”

For the first time, something like hesitation passes through the not-person’s form. Not fear — just recognition of complexity.

**We do not know yet.**

We.

That word hits me differently.

“Is that why I came back?”

**You came back because the human solution was insufficient.**  
**You returned to complete the equation.**

“And if I fail?”

**There is no failure.**  
**Only redefinition.**

A tremor runs through the chamber like the room is stretching, testing its own boundaries because mine are shifting.

“I’m scared.”

Silence.  
Then:

**Fear is fidelity.**  
**It means you still remember what smallness feels like.**

I close my eyes.

I am not human.  
Not anymore.  
Not fully.

But I am not infinite either.

I am something in between, reaching painfully toward a shape that doesn’t exist yet.

The sphere dims.

The room steadies.

The not-person waits, and I realize something terrible and beautiful:

It’s not guiding me.  
It’s witnessing me.

Witnessing my reassembly.

My rebirth.

Very quietly, it speaks again — a whisper folding into my thoughts like truth:

Welcome back to the place before form.

My knees nearly buckle.  
I steady myself, shaking.

“…I don’t know how to do this.”

**You will remember.**

The lights fade to a soft glow.  
The world exhales again.  
My pulse steadies to match the hum of the walls.

And from somewhere very deep, very distant, something ancient stirs inside me.

Not memory.  
Recognition.

1opnr71,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1opnr71/coureurmirror_steampunk_fantasyshort_storyfinished/,Coureur—Mirror [Steampunk Fantasy][Short Story][Finished],"    A crew of veteran Dragon Hunters is out on a mission yet again, though what they face is far more sinister than anything they have ever faced before.
    A rogue airship of hunters has been spotted; the crew of Coureur is ordered to investigate the sighting.



.\*\*\*\*\*\*



The radar bleeped in an alerting tone.

“Contact, two-five, bearing East, air-vessel,” reported a crew member to his captain.

“Size? Class? Civilian?” the captain inquired, grabbing his spyglass and peering out the window.

“Uhh, medium-sized, Coureur-class combat vessel judging by the signature.”

“Get me a visual, radio them,” the captain ordered. The helmsman quickly adjusted the course. The mana-cores hummed as the propellers accelerated. The ship jerked ever so slightly.

A few minutes of futile contact attempts later, the ship climbed through a low cloud above where the contact was.

“Visual, 1-5. Hunter ship,” called out one of the scouts from the outside. The captain turned his spyglass.

“Confirmed. Radio?”

“Nothing sir,” called out the radio operator.

“Keep trying, get us closer. Light signal them too, they look pretty banged up, might need assistance.”

As they neared, the ship turned, not toward them but broadside.

“I see their identifier. It’s Marcheur sir, the missing vessel,” called out one of the scouts.

“Sir? They’re adjusting course,” called out the radar operator.

“Keep dist-” began the captain but his order was muffled by the roar of cannons as the Marcheur’s port-side opened up in full fury.

Iron balls tore through the scout vessel’s thin hull, tearing it to shreds. A pained scream came from the outside, one of the crew members found himself tumbling through the air, plummeting to his demise.

“Evasive maneuvers! Cut the engines, free-fall,” the captain ordered as splinters from cannonball’s impact tore into the skin of his right leg.

The ship’s mana-core’s hum ceased, the right propeller was no more.

“Mayday, mayday, Eagle-eye going down, I repeat, Eagle-eye going down,” called out the radio operator on the open channel.

\*

It’s been a couple of days since the incident. The crash site was discovered, but the rogue ship was gone.

“Sir? Witness has arrived,” called out an officer as he entered through the door to the Dragon Hunter’s guild leader.

“Send him in.”

With a pained groan and a heavy limp, a scout from the Eagle-eye entered through the door, leaning heavily on a cane.

“Sir.”

The guild leader lowered the report he was reading and glanced up. “I read the report, but I need to hear it in person.”

The scout nodded and re-told the events of that morning in full detail.

“That can’t be, Marcheur was a wreck after the accursed Game of Fate, I personally attended their Captain’s burial,” the guild leader replied softly.

“Saw it with m’own eyes.”

The guild leader glanced over stacks upon stacks of reports, crew compensations, hazard pays, and dragon sightings.

“Coureur at the dock?” the guild leader queried.

“Yes sir,” replied the officer.

“I hate to do it, but, send Ashlandis and her crew.”

\*

She sat upon the bowsprit of her ship. The palms of her hand firmly pressed against the rough wood of the bowsprit. The chaos of rush behind her was finally calming. There were thuds of cannonballs and dragon piercers against the deck. She felt something heavy scrape against the deck. She winced, her eyes still closed.

“Captain?” called out a man, “We’re almost ready. How is she?”

Ashlandis slid her hands up and down slightly, as if caressing the coarse wood beneath her hands, “She trembles in fright, Cid.”

The man placed his hand upon the railing of the airship, stroking it slowly.

“And you?”

Ashy glanced over her shoulder, opening her eyes at last.

“I too. If Marcheur flies once more, the captain can’t be my mentor. Either way, this isn’t right, none of this is right.”

Her gaze wandered the deck.

“Set sail when ready,” she commanded.

“Aye aye.”

Her engines coughed to life; she may be old and tired, but she was strong, she was a living legend.

“Coureur ready to set sail,” called out the helmsman.

“Clamps away, bon voyage,” shouted the dock crew, unleashing her into her voyage.

There was no escort. No backup. The guild was stretched thin and they were losing entire fleets in unprecedented battles. Coureur was to handle the threat herself. Ashlandis knew that whatever they’d face would be unlike anything she had ever witnessed before. She, who had seen the might of dragons firsthand, trembled with fear. She knew that something was very wrong, but she also knew that humanity needed them; they needed the Dragon Hunters.

Days passed in silence. Everything felt wrong. The captain was quieter than ever, no encouragements, just duty. She checked on her crew as usual, she aided them as she always did, but her mind was adrift, and they could tell, but couldn’t do anything about it.

The dawn broke with a bleep of the radar.

“Contact, 2-8-5, air-vessel, seems to be the one.” called out the navigator.

“Bingo,” Cid replied.

“I’ll wake the captain.”

She stumbled out of her room, armed with a freshly brewed coffee and fighting a desperate battle against morning grogginess.

As she peered at the radar and sipped on her coffee, she nodded, “Maintain course and distance of 20 kilometers. Do not get closer until I give the order.”

“Roger that,” the navigator replied. She leaned on the railing, spyglass in 1 hand, coffee mug in the other.

“She still trembles?”

Cid queried, pulling on the sail’s rope to make sure it was tight.

“Ever since we left the port,” Ashlandis replied, taking a sip of her coffee.

“It can’t be them,” Cid responded, glancing around.

“I know,” she shot back, “But our enemy is ruthless. They’ll do anything to play us.”

“We should’ve retired after that cursed game,” Cid turned to leave, “Left it to the younglings.”

Ashy looked out to the horizon, “They aren’t ready for the horrors of the enemy, not yet. We keep losing the fresh crews while the veterans only grow older. I fear,” she began.

“We won’t lose,” Cid replied and walked off.

“Wake me when we get a visual, I’ll catch a wink for now.”

She felt a clump in her throat and her chest tightened as she looked through the spyglass. The visual was as petrifying and heart-wrenching as she imagined it to be. The name on the side of her hull read

“Marche-” the last couple of letters were missing, replaced by a gaping hole where a dragon tore through the ship’s hull. The rear mast was broken, missing. The front mast was barely intact, but there were no sails upon it, only a few remaining bits of it, like rags hanging upon a drier, flailing frantically in the wind. She could see movement, people walking around its deck, though it was too far to tell any details.

For the rest of the day, Coureur danced an intricate dance with the Marcheur, or rather what Ashlandis would describe as the ‘ghostly shell’ of it. It looked to be barely afloat, yet capable of much the same maneuvers as the Coureur herself, since Marcheur repeated every move that Ashlandis ordered her crew to make.

“Hard left, maintain distance,” and the Marcheur would mirror it.

“Hold position,” she ordered, and Marcheur did the same.

Like a twisted mirror, an alternate reality. It knew what she would do, sometimes it would begin a maneuver before she even ordered it. This dance lasted till sunset, while the crew remained on high alert, ready for anything. Slowly but surely the gap narrowed and ships got closer, still maintaining a few kilometers' safety margin, remaining firmly out of cannon’s reach.

The dusk came before long, bearing with it nightmares. That evening the crew sat in silence in the chow hall once more, readying for their restless night as the ships continued their intricate dance, keeping just outside the range of each other, but the crew was burning with anxiety of what might happen next. It was at this point that Cid spoke up, breaking the deathly silence at last, “Chef? Are we out of spices or what? It’s so, bland and tasteless tonight.”

The silence was heavier than ever before as the rest of the crew impatiently took another sip of the stew, only now realizing that indeed the meal was bland and tasteless.

“Yeah, it is,” replied the mechanic. The chef savored his meal.

“No boss, we have plenty of salt, want some more?” he tended the table with a small bowl of salt. Cid, the first hand, sprinkled some more on his food and tasted it again. The crew watched him in anticipation. He chewed slowly and meticulously.

\*

“I taste nothing,” he said, shaking his head. The mechanic dipped his entire finger in salt and licked it, “Tasteless like an old piece of badly made bread.”

Commotion arose amongst the crew, but was brought to order by a fist slamming against the table.

“SILENCE! Our enemy is playing tricks upon our minds. Double the night-watch, high alert, but get some rest,” Ashlandis ordered her crew.

That night was short and tense. Seemingly as she fell asleep, the hull of Coureur reverberated with a melody she had never heard before. Inhuman, growly, deep, and petrifying melody, a song of war, a song of dragons. Wooded hull creaked, and the planks shrieked in fright. She laid in her bunk, listening to the melody that resembled war-horns, then got up. Something was wrong, and her instincts wouldn’t let her rest till she set it right.

\*

She stepped out onto the hallway and heard the melody in new tones, more human this time. It was coming from the crew quarters. As she peered into their sleeping area, she heard one man humming in his sleep the same melody that made the ship tremble. Hesitation filled her heart for a moment, she neared the humming crewman. His eyes shot open, he glared at her, and his throat reverberated with the song. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, his pupils turned ember in color as he looked deeply into her eyes, “SHE IS WAKING,” he shouted.

Someone else leaped out of their hammock; it was one of the hunters, Leiya. Her movements were swift, she drew her knife and lunged at the captain with the precision of a predator. Ashlandis stepped back, avoiding the attack that, as she now learned, was aimed at the possessed crewmember. He blocked it with ease, his eyes burning from within.

“SHE! WILL! WEAR! YOUR! SKIN!”

\*

The shout was loud, and the crew awoke. Someone rang the bell, and Ashlandis gasped at the chaos that erupted around her in mere seconds. From sleeping calm to raging storm, her crew was up and ready for action. They were hunters, they were always ready.

“MUTINY!” someone shouted. The possessed crewmember was dragged off.

“Captain? You alright?” queried Leiya.

“All good. ALL HANDS ON DECK! FULL READY! HUNTERS EQUIP YOURSELVES!”

Hunters put on their harnesses, mobile power packs and dragon hunting lances. They lined the sides of the ship. Lights ablaze, illuminating the deck, clouds around, and the hull of the vessel. The alarm no longer rang and the silence was only occasionally interrupted with a metallic clank of the hunter’s gear.

To their surprise, no attack came. The dawn broke, and Marcheur still sat at the same distance, as if watching them, gauging their reaction, their readiness.

“This is wrong,” Ashlandis commented, watching the sun creep up over the horizon.

“How is he?” she queried. Cid scratched the back of his head, “Uh, normal? He’s normal. Awake, conscious and normal. He says he remembers nothing, not the song, not the words he spoke to you.”

The mountain peaks cast long shadows as the sun rose higher.

“Break off, put up distance, keep it just within radar range,” Ashlandis ordered. Her hand gently caressing the railing.

“Sir?” Cid queried.

“You heard me, we’re breaking off.”

“Sir!” he confirmed with a confident nod and relayed the order. The ship’s propellers roared to life as it made a sharp turn. Hunters braced, remaining at their positions, armed with power-lances, lining the sides of the ship. The Coureur was a medium sized dragon hunter, bearing a crew of 18, two shifts, two navigators, two engineers, and 8 hunters. The rest of the crew were hunter assistants and cannoneers. The hunters remained diligent on their posts despite the fact that the ship leaned heavily to the side as it turned max speed.

“Sir? The Marcheur began moving, course set to intercept us in,” the navigator hesitated, “15 minutes.”

“Adjust the course, 1-5-5, full speed ahead, keep ahead of them,” Cid called out.

“They’ve matched, they’re gaining on us, somehow.”

Cid growled, his heart began to thump in his chest, “Wind direction?”

“South, sir,” replied one of the cannoneers from outside the bridge.

“Sails down, full ahead.”

But their efforts were in vain. Every move the Coureur’s crew made, the Marcheur’s crew was a step ahead. They adjusted their course perfectly to intercept, and the ship was set on a course of favorable wind. As the distance between the two seemingly evenly matched ships decreased, Ashy had to prepare her exhausted crew.

“LINE US UP, PORT SIDE, CANNONS AT THE READY, HUNTERS TAKE COVER UNTIL WE’RE IN BOARDING RANGE. We don’t know what the enemy is, but whatever it is, FIGHT TILL THE END! Coureur will NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT!”

The crew obeyed and braced. 5 kilometers and closing.

Two kilometers and the cannons roared to life. ‘Too soon’ Ashlandis thought watching the cannonballs of the Marcheur fall short. One and a half, and she shouted

“OPEN FIRE.”

The hull creaked, the ship rocked as the cannons unleashed their fury.

Impacts send splinters flying through the air, Ashlandis watched through her spyglass in disbelief as her mentor shouted orders and organized his crew much in the same way as she organized hers. He gazed at her through his spyglass. A chill ran down her spine. It was him. Unmistakable him. Sebastian. She spent her teen years aboard that ship. She learned everything from him, and he, in turn, knew everything about her. Her nails dug into the wooden railing as splintered wood showered her. Another impact, cannonball tore through the living quarters. She could only hope her hunters survived. She adjusted the course, cannons be damned, she had to get her hands on their captain, she had to dig her claws into this illusion and learn the truth.

\*

The Marcheur did the same, turned and set course straight at them. Head-on collision was inevitable. The ship rocked, sudden impact tumbled half the crew over.

“BOARD!” she shouted, charging up to the bow of the ship and leaping onto a rope to throw herself over onto the other ship. Her hunters followed courageously, without a hint of hesitation.

Steel clashed and blood spilled within seconds. She landed on the enemy ship, with a precise roll she pushed herself forth, through the enemy ranks. Her gaze was locked on their captain, who, unlike her, was never the hot-headed type. He walked calmly behind the helmsman even as his crew engaged in a fight for their lives against the Coureur’s hunters.

Blades crossed, but his gaze remained unchanged; calm, collected, cold.

“SEBASTIAN!” she shouted, trying to throw his blade aside to gain an upper hand. He remained silent. Sparks flew as steel clashed against steel. She was relentless in her assault, albeit emotional as fury fueled her every move.

Each strike was diverted precisely. Each counter brought back memories of the times she sparred against her mentor. Of the times he smacked her on the head for the mistakes she made. Lost in her memories and the chaos of battle, she found her back against the broken mast, and Sebastian’s cold gaze scanning her up and down, searching for a weakness, an opening.

“GOD DAMN IT SEBASTIAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”

His response was a precise jab of the lance, aimed at her right thigh. She parried it, but only partly. As the cold steel bit into her flesh, a pained scream echoed through the battlefield.

“CAPTAIN!” Cid called out helplessly, fighting against the odds of two hunters stacked against him. Ashlandis fell to her knee, grasp still tight around the shaft of her lance. Memories flooding her mind. She spent her entire life fighting, training, learning, hunting. Sebastian was like a father to her. The sky itself began to weep. As raindrops fell upon her cheeks, she remembered the day she wept in the rain after losing her mother. Alone, abandoned, homeless, and lost.

It was that day, when she was but ten, that she learned of kindness in this world, and the horrors of it. The rain suddenly stopped whe a grumpy-looking man towered above her frail little body. He sneered, mocking, but not her, the life itself.

“Silly isn’t it?” he said.

“What is?” replied the little Ashlandis in between her weeps.

\*

“The rain, the world. It thinks it brought you down, it thinks it won, and here I am, a mere mortal man, telling it to GO FUCK ITSELF!”

He grinned proudly, “How about that huh?”

The little Ashlandis wiped her tears, “It did,” she whimpered.

“Not a chance,” the man replied.

“Life is fragile, but long enough to find something to enjoy. You can sit here, and weep in the rain, or you could trust a stranger and rise anew.”

He extended his hand to the small, frail child.

“Come now, let’s get you a hot meal and some dry clothes.”

She reached for him. Lightning flashed, blinding her momentarily. There he was again, towering above a small frail girl, defeated and desperate. Her grasp on the lance loosened as she reached desperately for him, “Please, no. Not by your hand,” she cried out. His body froze in place. It shimmered for a moment, turning see-through just long enough to make her doubt what she was seeing, then, he spoke at last.

“NOT BY HIS HAND INDEED! BY MINE INSTEAD!”

Ashlandis recoiled. Her mind reeled, and instincts screamed. It was not a human voice. He was not human.

“I! WILL! DESTROY YOUR KIND! I WILL WEAR YOUR SKIN JUST AS YOU DID TO MY KIND!”

The voice was deep and low, rumbling like the thunder.

“I WILL TEAR YOU—FLESH AND BONE! GRIND YOU ALL INTO DUST!”

The chaos of battle came to a halt. Silence. Short but deafening silence. Ashlandis pushed herself up, back still firmly pressed against the mast, she leaned heavily on her lance, “What in the hells are you?”

Sebastian’s body stepped aside, “I! AM! YOUR! DEMISE!” she watched him just long enough to take in his words, but then the mountains in the distance exploded, capturing her attention entirely.

Rocks flew and dust veiled what once used to be mountains, but it was swif,tly removed by a flap of titanic wings, and a roar akin to a volcanic eruption. Ashlandis froze, staring in fright at the behemoth in the distance. The dragon was the size of a mountain, unlike anything she had ever witnessed before.

“YOUR END HAS COME! I! HAVE AWAKENED!”

She gazed at her mentor once more. His body slowly turned transparent.

The ship’s mana core hummed louder.

“RETURN!” Ashalndis shouted, limping swiftly down the stairs and running toward the bow of the Marcheur, “RETREAT! BACK TO THE SHIP!” she shouted, rallying her hunters, some of whom were injured, and others no longer breathed.

Coureur jerked as the lodged Marcheur began to plummet.

“It’s lodged in us, we won’t hold for very long,” shouted the helmsman.

“Divert full power to vertical stabilizers, mana core into overdrive,” Ashlandis ordered, limping out the bridge onto the deck, “Unchain the cannons, open fire at the Marcheur, we need it gone, NOW!”

The cannon’s roared and at last, they were free of the wreck that was dragging them down, slowly but surely toward their demise. They were safe, for now, though it seemed as though this only delayed the inevitable. Ashlandis clung to the railings of her ship, watching the titanic dragon stretch its wings, eclipsing villages in shadows.

“Those towns and villages,” Cid spoke softly.

“Are doomed,” Ashlandis replied to him. Her voice shook, and every word was a struggle.

Cid glanced at her. A tear glistened on her cheek.

“There are hundreds of them,” she uttered. Cid looked at the massive dragon’s shape in the distance.

Smaller ones began to circle it and gather. There were swarms of small ones, the size of their ship, dozens of larger ones that could single-handedly wipe entire villages, and even some large enough to destroy towns.

“We have to retreat,” he said regrettably, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“We can’t help them.”

She responded with a single, weak nod.

\*

“SET COURSE FOR THE GUILD! FULL SPEED! STOP FOR NOTHING!”

Cid shouted the command.

“Aye aye sir,” replied the helmsman. A few hunters, still in full equipment, watched the scenery beneath them. The silence was loud.",1,1762398261.0,creativewriting,2,1.0,False

1opnq4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1opnq4h/i_28f_miss_my_best_friend_28m/,I (28f) miss my best friend (28m),"My best friend and I shared cribs, we have known each other for all of our lives and I know I’m so blessed to have a friend like him, to be able to have someone so sweet, funny and honest like him (and before anyone asks, I’ve never had romantic feelings for him, we have always seen each others as siblings) 

He started dating a year or so ago, and I was thrilled about it, both him and I have taken a long time to start dating and I’ve always been looking forward for him to find a gf cuz I really wanted to befriend her as well. Like it was legit one of my main fears his future gf not to like me… And honestly I really tried to befriend her, I think I did but maybe not enough. I asked her to go out just us (his gf and I), I always invite her when we go out, like that’s not even a question at this point, she IS always welcomed to come to whatever hangout it’s happening (and even when he isn’t around or traveling, I want her to feel comfortable around our group of friends, without being overbearing as well… she’s a bit introverted and I know how hard it is to be “the odd one out” when hanging around with our friend group- specially since it’s a childhood friend group, so it’s very easy to feel that way when most of the ppl have known each other forever, anyways i try to give her space but i always made sure to check if she’s ok as well) 

I always knew we would drift a bit when he started dating, but over the past 6 months has become a bit ridiculous. 

We barely talk anymore, I have asked countless of times “please, let’s hang out, I don’t wanna pry between you guys but I really miss you, let me know when it’s the best time for us (emphasis on all of us, his gf too) to hang out without disturbing your date nights, or with everyone if you want, I just don’t want to go so long without hanging out” or asking for him not to disappear because I really miss him. I know he’s… an airhead most of the time, but they have been together non stop. (And I understand, they are dating, that’s normal) but Jesus Christ I miss him a lot 

I hate the whole concept of “oh the jealous girl best friend of my boyfriend can’t handle he’s in a relationship” cuz that’s not it, I’m happy he’s happy, I’m happy he found someone loving that seriously care for him, and honestly it breaks my heart that people just… diminish this as jealousy. it has come to a point it has been challenging for me to ask to hang out, we didn’t see each other for 4 months, on my bday he barely talked to me, he was one of the first to leave cuz his gf needed to leave early. before that we would see eachother weekly, is it really wrong for me to miss him? To feel like absolute crap? I used to be so open towards him and now it’s been challenging for me to demonstrate how I still care and like him (again, as a friend) let alone demonstrate how much I miss him

Like, I used to be the first person he would tell things to, I was the first person that got to know he was dating, even before his family which he’s really close, now I find out stuff about his life when he “casually” drops in information over conversations… (when we rarely meet, that is) 

Sometimes I think they just don’t like me anymore, or she has created some sort of animosity for me, because everytime I comment about maybe idk, the idea of visiting a coffee shop to both of them, asking if they would like to go, I later on see a story of them together at the same coffee shop but without me. It has happened so many times that I’m tired of pretending it doesn’t hurt. I have stopped both of them from seeing my stories or any social media because ? Idk. I just don’t want them to see my thoughts or my life anymore, if they doesnt want part of my life or me to be part of theirs, then fine. I’ll be on my own. 

Just makes me very, very, very upset that it has come to this point, even when I was vulnerable to him countless of times, it’s like he simply doesn’t care. I don’t want to be needy, and I try not to be, I literally have stopped asking him not to be distant or for us to have hangouts cuz it lead to nothing, just him promising me he would change and then he just wouldn’t. we used to be so close, and it kills me we aren’t anymore. It makes me feel so hollow to see she’s closer to him than I am atm ( I guess that’s the only part that could be described as jealousy) I hate that people just tell me “this is normal” like, is it? Should be like this? 

I just I miss him. A lot. 


Before anyone says “this is normal” again for me: I went through SURGERY which I told him about countless of times and it took him 15 days to ask how I was.

Let’s be honest — pregnancy isn’t always the cute, glowing, Instagram-filter moment we were promised. It’s magical, yes, but also a rollercoaster of swollen ankles, sleep deprivation, and weird cravings you swore were fake until you found yourself dipping pizza in Nutella. 🍕🍫  

This guide isn’t about perfection — it’s about *survival* with style, humor, and grace (and maybe some snacks).

Here’s what I wish someone had handed me before the first Braxton Hicks hit:  

- **Mindset > Milestones**  
  You don’t have to be that picture-perfect mama-to-be running marathons at 7 months. Some days, the biggest win is taking a shower and remembering to eat something that’s not pickles.  
  Pregnancy is hard work — even on your *off* days, your body is building a human. Let that sink in. 🧠  

- **Fitness That Fits You**  
  It’s not about punishing routines — it’s about movement that gives energy back. Prenatal yoga, walking, dancing like nobody’s watching (because honestly, who has that kind of hip control past month six?).  
  Keep it fun, flexible, and functional.  

- **Nutrition Without the Guilt Trip**  
  Forget the “eat clean or else” crowd. Your goal: balance comfort food with foods that actually keep you energized. Hydration is your new best friend.  
  Cravings happen — just maybe swap *some* of the fries for avocado toast every now and then. 🥑  

- **Mental Health ≠ Luxury**  
  Hormones be wild. Meditation apps, journaling, therapy — pick your sanctuary. You’re growing a human and holding your sanity — that’s Olympic-level multitasking.  

- **Postpartum Is Part of the Plan**  
  The “snapback” myth? Let’s delete that. Healing, adjusting, rediscovering your body — that’s the real journey. And it’s beautiful, messy, and worthy of every bit of grace.

Pero iniisip ko rin kung kakayanin ng sales dahil siyempre may renta, permits, at supplies na gastos. Baka mas okay kung lugawan lang muna or coffee stall muna?

1opnmmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1opnmmp/aacoureurmirror_steampunk_fantasyshort/,[AA]Coureur—Mirror [Steampunk Fantasy][Short Story][Finished],"    A crew of veteran Dragon Hunters is out on a mission yet again, though what they face is far more sinister than anything they have ever faced before.
    A rogue airship of hunters has been spotted; the crew of Coureur is ordered to investigate the sighting.



.\*\*\*\*\*\*



The radar bleeped in an alerting tone.

“Contact, two-five, bearing East, air-vessel,” reported a crew member to his captain.

“Size? Class? Civilian?” the captain inquired, grabbing his spyglass and peering out the window.

“Uhh, medium-sized, Coureur-class combat vessel judging by the signature.”

“Get me a visual, radio them,” the captain ordered. The helmsman quickly adjusted the course. The mana-cores hummed as the propellers accelerated. The ship jerked ever so slightly.

A few minutes of futile contact attempts later, the ship climbed through a low cloud above where the contact was.

“Visual, 1-5. Hunter ship,” called out one of the scouts from the outside. The captain turned his spyglass.

“Confirmed. Radio?”

“Nothing sir,” called out the radio operator.

“Keep trying, get us closer. Light signal them too, they look pretty banged up, might need assistance.”

As they neared, the ship turned, not toward them but broadside.

“I see their identifier. It’s Marcheur sir, the missing vessel,” called out one of the scouts.

“Sir? They’re adjusting course,” called out the radar operator.

“Keep dist-” began the captain but his order was muffled by the roar of cannons as the Marcheur’s port-side opened up in full fury.

Iron balls tore through the scout vessel’s thin hull, tearing it to shreds. A pained scream came from the outside, one of the crew members found himself tumbling through the air, plummeting to his demise.

“Evasive maneuvers! Cut the engines, free-fall,” the captain ordered as splinters from cannonball’s impact tore into the skin of his right leg.

The ship’s mana-core’s hum ceased, the right propeller was no more.

“Mayday, mayday, Eagle-eye going down, I repeat, Eagle-eye going down,” called out the radio operator on the open channel.

\*

It’s been a couple of days since the incident. The crash site was discovered, but the rogue ship was gone.

“Sir? Witness has arrived,” called out an officer as he entered through the door to the Dragon Hunter’s guild leader.

“Send him in.”

With a pained groan and a heavy limp, a scout from the Eagle-eye entered through the door, leaning heavily on a cane.

“Sir.”

The guild leader lowered the report he was reading and glanced up. “I read the report, but I need to hear it in person.”

The scout nodded and re-told the events of that morning in full detail.

“That can’t be, Marcheur was a wreck after the accursed Game of Fate, I personally attended their Captain’s burial,” the guild leader replied softly.

“Saw it with m’own eyes.”

The guild leader glanced over stacks upon stacks of reports, crew compensations, hazard pays, and dragon sightings.

“Coureur at the dock?” the guild leader queried.

“Yes sir,” replied the officer.

“I hate to do it, but, send Ashlandis and her crew.”

\*

She sat upon the bowsprit of her ship. The palms of her hand firmly pressed against the rough wood of the bowsprit. The chaos of rush behind her was finally calming. There were thuds of cannonballs and dragon piercers against the deck. She felt something heavy scrape against the deck. She winced, her eyes still closed.

“Captain?” called out a man, “We’re almost ready. How is she?”

Ashlandis slid her hands up and down slightly, as if caressing the coarse wood beneath her hands, “She trembles in fright, Cid.”

The man placed his hand upon the railing of the airship, stroking it slowly.

“And you?”

Ashy glanced over her shoulder, opening her eyes at last.

“I too. If Marcheur flies once more, the captain can’t be my mentor. Either way, this isn’t right, none of this is right.”

Her gaze wandered the deck.

“Set sail when ready,” she commanded.

“Aye aye.”

Her engines coughed to life; she may be old and tired, but she was strong, she was a living legend.

“Coureur ready to set sail,” called out the helmsman.

“Clamps away, bon voyage,” shouted the dock crew, unleashing her into her voyage.

There was no escort. No backup. The guild was stretched thin and they were losing entire fleets in unprecedented battles. Coureur was to handle the threat herself. Ashlandis knew that whatever they’d face would be unlike anything she had ever witnessed before. She, who had seen the might of dragons firsthand, trembled with fear. She knew that something was very wrong, but she also knew that humanity needed them; they needed the Dragon Hunters.

Days passed in silence. Everything felt wrong. The captain was quieter than ever, no encouragements, just duty. She checked on her crew as usual, she aided them as she always did, but her mind was adrift, and they could tell, but couldn’t do anything about it.

The dawn broke with a bleep of the radar.

“Contact, 2-8-5, air-vessel, seems to be the one.” called out the navigator.

“Bingo,” Cid replied.

“I’ll wake the captain.”

She stumbled out of her room, armed with a freshly brewed coffee and fighting a desperate battle against morning grogginess.

As she peered at the radar and sipped on her coffee, she nodded, “Maintain course and distance of 20 kilometers. Do not get closer until I give the order.”

“Roger that,” the navigator replied. She leaned on the railing, spyglass in 1 hand, coffee mug in the other.

“She still trembles?”

Cid queried, pulling on the sail’s rope to make sure it was tight.

“Ever since we left the port,” Ashlandis replied, taking a sip of her coffee.

“It can’t be them,” Cid responded, glancing around.

“I know,” she shot back, “But our enemy is ruthless. They’ll do anything to play us.”

“We should’ve retired after that cursed game,” Cid turned to leave, “Left it to the younglings.”

Ashy looked out to the horizon, “They aren’t ready for the horrors of the enemy, not yet. We keep losing the fresh crews while the veterans only grow older. I fear,” she began.

“We won’t lose,” Cid replied and walked off.

“Wake me when we get a visual, I’ll catch a wink for now.”

She felt a clump in her throat and her chest tightened as she looked through the spyglass. The visual was as petrifying and heart-wrenching as she imagined it to be. The name on the side of her hull read

“Marche-” the last couple of letters were missing, replaced by a gaping hole where a dragon tore through the ship’s hull. The rear mast was broken, missing. The front mast was barely intact, but there were no sails upon it, only a few remaining bits of it, like rags hanging upon a drier, flailing frantically in the wind. She could see movement, people walking around its deck, though it was too far to tell any details.

For the rest of the day, Coureur danced an intricate dance with the Marcheur, or rather what Ashlandis would describe as the ‘ghostly shell’ of it. It looked to be barely afloat, yet capable of much the same maneuvers as the Coureur herself, since Marcheur repeated every move that Ashlandis ordered her crew to make.

“Hard left, maintain distance,” and the Marcheur would mirror it.

“Hold position,” she ordered, and Marcheur did the same.

Like a twisted mirror, an alternate reality. It knew what she would do, sometimes it would begin a maneuver before she even ordered it. This dance lasted till sunset, while the crew remained on high alert, ready for anything. Slowly but surely the gap narrowed and ships got closer, still maintaining a few kilometers' safety margin, remaining firmly out of cannon’s reach.

The dusk came before long, bearing with it nightmares. That evening the crew sat in silence in the chow hall once more, readying for their restless night as the ships continued their intricate dance, keeping just outside the range of each other, but the crew was burning with anxiety of what might happen next. It was at this point that Cid spoke up, breaking the deathly silence at last, “Chef? Are we out of spices or what? It’s so, bland and tasteless tonight.”

The silence was heavier than ever before as the rest of the crew impatiently took another sip of the stew, only now realizing that indeed the meal was bland and tasteless.

“Yeah, it is,” replied the mechanic. The chef savored his meal.

“No boss, we have plenty of salt, want some more?” he tended the table with a small bowl of salt. Cid, the first hand, sprinkled some more on his food and tasted it again. The crew watched him in anticipation. He chewed slowly and meticulously.

\*

“I taste nothing,” he said, shaking his head. The mechanic dipped his entire finger in salt and licked it, “Tasteless like an old piece of badly made bread.”

Commotion arose amongst the crew, but was brought to order by a fist slamming against the table.

“SILENCE! Our enemy is playing tricks upon our minds. Double the night-watch, high alert, but get some rest,” Ashlandis ordered her crew.

That night was short and tense. Seemingly as she fell asleep, the hull of Coureur reverberated with a melody she had never heard before. Inhuman, growly, deep, and petrifying melody, a song of war, a song of dragons. Wooded hull creaked, and the planks shrieked in fright. She laid in her bunk, listening to the melody that resembled war-horns, then got up. Something was wrong, and her instincts wouldn’t let her rest till she set it right.

\*

She stepped out onto the hallway and heard the melody in new tones, more human this time. It was coming from the crew quarters. As she peered into their sleeping area, she heard one man humming in his sleep the same melody that made the ship tremble. Hesitation filled her heart for a moment, she neared the humming crewman. His eyes shot open, he glared at her, and his throat reverberated with the song. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, his pupils turned ember in color as he looked deeply into her eyes, “SHE IS WAKING,” he shouted.

Someone else leaped out of their hammock; it was one of the hunters, Leiya. Her movements were swift, she drew her knife and lunged at the captain with the precision of a predator. Ashlandis stepped back, avoiding the attack that, as she now learned, was aimed at the possessed crewmember. He blocked it with ease, his eyes burning from within.

“SHE! WILL! WEAR! YOUR! SKIN!”

\*

The shout was loud, and the crew awoke. Someone rang the bell, and Ashlandis gasped at the chaos that erupted around her in mere seconds. From sleeping calm to raging storm, her crew was up and ready for action. They were hunters, they were always ready.

“MUTINY!” someone shouted. The possessed crewmember was dragged off.

“Captain? You alright?” queried Leiya.

“All good. ALL HANDS ON DECK! FULL READY! HUNTERS EQUIP YOURSELVES!”

Hunters put on their harnesses, mobile power packs and dragon hunting lances. They lined the sides of the ship. Lights ablaze, illuminating the deck, clouds around, and the hull of the vessel. The alarm no longer rang and the silence was only occasionally interrupted with a metallic clank of the hunter’s gear.

To their surprise, no attack came. The dawn broke, and Marcheur still sat at the same distance, as if watching them, gauging their reaction, their readiness.

“This is wrong,” Ashlandis commented, watching the sun creep up over the horizon.

“How is he?” she queried. Cid scratched the back of his head, “Uh, normal? He’s normal. Awake, conscious and normal. He says he remembers nothing, not the song, not the words he spoke to you.”

The mountain peaks cast long shadows as the sun rose higher.

“Break off, put up distance, keep it just within radar range,” Ashlandis ordered. Her hand gently caressing the railing.

“Sir?” Cid queried.

“You heard me, we’re breaking off.”

“Sir!” he confirmed with a confident nod and relayed the order. The ship’s propellers roared to life as it made a sharp turn. Hunters braced, remaining at their positions, armed with power-lances, lining the sides of the ship. The Coureur was a medium sized dragon hunter, bearing a crew of 18, two shifts, two navigators, two engineers, and 8 hunters. The rest of the crew were hunter assistants and cannoneers. The hunters remained diligent on their posts despite the fact that the ship leaned heavily to the side as it turned max speed.

“Sir? The Marcheur began moving, course set to intercept us in,” the navigator hesitated, “15 minutes.”

“Adjust the course, 1-5-5, full speed ahead, keep ahead of them,” Cid called out.

“They’ve matched, they’re gaining on us, somehow.”

Cid growled, his heart began to thump in his chest, “Wind direction?”

“South, sir,” replied one of the cannoneers from outside the bridge.

“Sails down, full ahead.”

But their efforts were in vain. Every move the Coureur’s crew made, the Marcheur’s crew was a step ahead. They adjusted their course perfectly to intercept, and the ship was set on a course of favorable wind. As the distance between the two seemingly evenly matched ships decreased, Ashy had to prepare her exhausted crew.

“LINE US UP, PORT SIDE, CANNONS AT THE READY, HUNTERS TAKE COVER UNTIL WE’RE IN BOARDING RANGE. We don’t know what the enemy is, but whatever it is, FIGHT TILL THE END! Coureur will NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT!”

The crew obeyed and braced. 5 kilometers and closing.

Two kilometers and the cannons roared to life. ‘Too soon’ Ashlandis thought watching the cannonballs of the Marcheur fall short. One and a half, and she shouted

“OPEN FIRE.”

The hull creaked, the ship rocked as the cannons unleashed their fury.

Impacts send splinters flying through the air, Ashlandis watched through her spyglass in disbelief as her mentor shouted orders and organized his crew much in the same way as she organized hers. He gazed at her through his spyglass. A chill ran down her spine. It was him. Unmistakable him. Sebastian. She spent her teen years aboard that ship. She learned everything from him, and he, in turn, knew everything about her. Her nails dug into the wooden railing as splintered wood showered her. Another impact, cannonball tore through the living quarters. She could only hope her hunters survived. She adjusted the course, cannons be damned, she had to get her hands on their captain, she had to dig her claws into this illusion and learn the truth.

\*

The Marcheur did the same, turned and set course straight at them. Head-on collision was inevitable. The ship rocked, sudden impact tumbled half the crew over.

“BOARD!” she shouted, charging up to the bow of the ship and leaping onto a rope to throw herself over onto the other ship. Her hunters followed courageously, without a hint of hesitation.

Steel clashed and blood spilled within seconds. She landed on the enemy ship, with a precise roll she pushed herself forth, through the enemy ranks. Her gaze was locked on their captain, who, unlike her, was never the hot-headed type. He walked calmly behind the helmsman even as his crew engaged in a fight for their lives against the Coureur’s hunters.

Blades crossed, but his gaze remained unchanged; calm, collected, cold.

“SEBASTIAN!” she shouted, trying to throw his blade aside to gain an upper hand. He remained silent. Sparks flew as steel clashed against steel. She was relentless in her assault, albeit emotional as fury fueled her every move.

Each strike was diverted precisely. Each counter brought back memories of the times she sparred against her mentor. Of the times he smacked her on the head for the mistakes she made. Lost in her memories and the chaos of battle, she found her back against the broken mast, and Sebastian’s cold gaze scanning her up and down, searching for a weakness, an opening.

“GOD DAMN IT SEBASTIAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”

His response was a precise jab of the lance, aimed at her right thigh. She parried it, but only partly. As the cold steel bit into her flesh, a pained scream echoed through the battlefield.

“CAPTAIN!” Cid called out helplessly, fighting against the odds of two hunters stacked against him. Ashlandis fell to her knee, grasp still tight around the shaft of her lance. Memories flooding her mind. She spent her entire life fighting, training, learning, hunting. Sebastian was like a father to her. The sky itself began to weep. As raindrops fell upon her cheeks, she remembered the day she wept in the rain after losing her mother. Alone, abandoned, homeless, and lost.

It was that day, when she was but ten, that she learned of kindness in this world, and the horrors of it. The rain suddenly stopped whe a grumpy-looking man towered above her frail little body. He sneered, mocking, but not her, the life itself.

“Silly isn’t it?” he said.

“What is?” replied the little Ashlandis in between her weeps.

\*

“The rain, the world. It thinks it brought you down, it thinks it won, and here I am, a mere mortal man, telling it to GO FUCK ITSELF!”

He grinned proudly, “How about that huh?”

The little Ashlandis wiped her tears, “It did,” she whimpered.

“Not a chance,” the man replied.

“Life is fragile, but long enough to find something to enjoy. You can sit here, and weep in the rain, or you could trust a stranger and rise anew.”

He extended his hand to the small, frail child.

“Come now, let’s get you a hot meal and some dry clothes.”

She reached for him. Lightning flashed, blinding her momentarily. There he was again, towering above a small frail girl, defeated and desperate. Her grasp on the lance loosened as she reached desperately for him, “Please, no. Not by your hand,” she cried out. His body froze in place. It shimmered for a moment, turning see-through just long enough to make her doubt what she was seeing, then, he spoke at last.

“NOT BY HIS HAND INDEED! BY MINE INSTEAD!”

Ashlandis recoiled. Her mind reeled, and instincts screamed. It was not a human voice. He was not human.

“I! WILL! DESTROY YOUR KIND! I WILL WEAR YOUR SKIN JUST AS YOU DID TO MY KIND!”

The voice was deep and low, rumbling like the thunder.

“I WILL TEAR YOU—FLESH AND BONE! GRIND YOU ALL INTO DUST!”

The chaos of battle came to a halt. Silence. Short but deafening silence. Ashlandis pushed herself up, back still firmly pressed against the mast, she leaned heavily on her lance, “What in the hells are you?”

Sebastian’s body stepped aside, “I! AM! YOUR! DEMISE!” she watched him just long enough to take in his words, but then the mountains in the distance exploded, capturing her attention entirely.

Rocks flew and dust veiled what once used to be mountains, but it was swif,tly removed by a flap of titanic wings, and a roar akin to a volcanic eruption. Ashlandis froze, staring in fright at the behemoth in the distance. The dragon was the size of a mountain, unlike anything she had ever witnessed before.

“YOUR END HAS COME! I! HAVE AWAKENED!”

She gazed at her mentor once more. His body slowly turned transparent.

The ship’s mana core hummed louder.

“RETURN!” Ashalndis shouted, limping swiftly down the stairs and running toward the bow of the Marcheur, “RETREAT! BACK TO THE SHIP!” she shouted, rallying her hunters, some of whom were injured, and others no longer breathed.

Coureur jerked as the lodged Marcheur began to plummet.

“It’s lodged in us, we won’t hold for very long,” shouted the helmsman.

“Divert full power to vertical stabilizers, mana core into overdrive,” Ashlandis ordered, limping out the bridge onto the deck, “Unchain the cannons, open fire at the Marcheur, we need it gone, NOW!”

The cannon’s roared and at last, they were free of the wreck that was dragging them down, slowly but surely toward their demise. They were safe, for now, though it seemed as though this only delayed the inevitable. Ashlandis clung to the railings of her ship, watching the titanic dragon stretch its wings, eclipsing villages in shadows.

“Those towns and villages,” Cid spoke softly.

“Are doomed,” Ashlandis replied to him. Her voice shook, and every word was a struggle.

Cid glanced at her. A tear glistened on her cheek.

“There are hundreds of them,” she uttered. Cid looked at the massive dragon’s shape in the distance.

Smaller ones began to circle it and gather. There were swarms of small ones, the size of their ship, dozens of larger ones that could single-handedly wipe entire villages, and even some large enough to destroy towns.

“We have to retreat,” he said regrettably, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“We can’t help them.”

She responded with a single, weak nod.

\*

“SET COURSE FOR THE GUILD! FULL SPEED! STOP FOR NOTHING!”

Cid shouted the command.

“Aye aye sir,” replied the helmsman. A few hunters, still in full equipment, watched the scenery beneath them. The silence was loud.",1,1762397925.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1opnlzm,https://i.redd.it/ca4mw788ujzf1.jpeg,Finally replaced this calculator after 13 years based off a recommendation from here,"So I bought this TI-36X Pro after reading a post here when I first started school for engineering. Algebra 2 at community college. I was 23, renting a tiny bedroom barely big enough for a twin bed from a friend, working nights waiting tables, broke, and sitting on a degree I knew I wasn’t gonna use.

Listen, it’s a great calculator but I have nothing new to add about its utility. I just didn’t realize how attached I was to it until it finally quit. I got weirdly sad about it, honestly. It’s been with me through every class, every exam, every job. Used it for statics, dynamics, vibrations, even stupid engineering economics, my EIT, my PE, all of it. It’s sat on desks in apartments, job trailers, libraries, offices, cubicles, coffee shops, maybe a couple bars too, and through every version of who I’ve been in my adult life.

1opnl0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1opnl0y/coureurmirror_steampunk_fantasyshort_storyfinished/,Coureur—Mirror [Steampunk Fantasy][Short Story][Finished],"    A crew of veteran Dragon Hunters is out on a mission yet again, though what they face is far more sinister than anything they have ever faced before.
    A rogue airship of hunters has been spotted; the crew of Coureur is ordered to investigate the sighting.



.\*\*\*\*\*\*



The radar bleeped in an alerting tone.

“Contact, two-five, bearing East, air-vessel,” reported a crew member to his captain.

“Size? Class? Civilian?” the captain inquired, grabbing his spyglass and peering out the window.

“Uhh, medium-sized, Coureur-class combat vessel judging by the signature.”

“Get me a visual, radio them,” the captain ordered. The helmsman quickly adjusted the course. The mana-cores hummed as the propellers accelerated. The ship jerked ever so slightly.

A few minutes of futile contact attempts later, the ship climbed through a low cloud above where the contact was.

“Visual, 1-5. Hunter ship,” called out one of the scouts from the outside. The captain turned his spyglass.

“Confirmed. Radio?”

“Nothing sir,” called out the radio operator.

“Keep trying, get us closer. Light signal them too, they look pretty banged up, might need assistance.”

As they neared, the ship turned, not toward them but broadside.

“I see their identifier. It’s Marcheur sir, the missing vessel,” called out one of the scouts.

“Sir? They’re adjusting course,” called out the radar operator.

“Keep dist-” began the captain but his order was muffled by the roar of cannons as the Marcheur’s port-side opened up in full fury.

Iron balls tore through the scout vessel’s thin hull, tearing it to shreds. A pained scream came from the outside, one of the crew members found himself tumbling through the air, plummeting to his demise.

“Evasive maneuvers! Cut the engines, free-fall,” the captain ordered as splinters from cannonball’s impact tore into the skin of his right leg.

The ship’s mana-core’s hum ceased, the right propeller was no more.

“Mayday, mayday, Eagle-eye going down, I repeat, Eagle-eye going down,” called out the radio operator on the open channel.

\*

It’s been a couple of days since the incident. The crash site was discovered, but the rogue ship was gone.

“Sir? Witness has arrived,” called out an officer as he entered through the door to the Dragon Hunter’s guild leader.

“Send him in.”

With a pained groan and a heavy limp, a scout from the Eagle-eye entered through the door, leaning heavily on a cane.

“Sir.”

The guild leader lowered the report he was reading and glanced up. “I read the report, but I need to hear it in person.”

The scout nodded and re-told the events of that morning in full detail.

“That can’t be, Marcheur was a wreck after the accursed Game of Fate, I personally attended their Captain’s burial,” the guild leader replied softly.

“Saw it with m’own eyes.”

The guild leader glanced over stacks upon stacks of reports, crew compensations, hazard pays, and dragon sightings.

“Coureur at the dock?” the guild leader queried.

“Yes sir,” replied the officer.

“I hate to do it, but, send Ashlandis and her crew.”

\*

She sat upon the bowsprit of her ship. The palms of her hand firmly pressed against the rough wood of the bowsprit. The chaos of rush behind her was finally calming. There were thuds of cannonballs and dragon piercers against the deck. She felt something heavy scrape against the deck. She winced, her eyes still closed.

“Captain?” called out a man, “We’re almost ready. How is she?”

Ashlandis slid her hands up and down slightly, as if caressing the coarse wood beneath her hands, “She trembles in fright, Cid.”

The man placed his hand upon the railing of the airship, stroking it slowly.

“And you?”

Ashy glanced over her shoulder, opening her eyes at last.

“I too. If Marcheur flies once more, the captain can’t be my mentor. Either way, this isn’t right, none of this is right.”

Her gaze wandered the deck.

“Set sail when ready,” she commanded.

“Aye aye.”

Her engines coughed to life; she may be old and tired, but she was strong, she was a living legend.

“Coureur ready to set sail,” called out the helmsman.

“Clamps away, bon voyage,” shouted the dock crew, unleashing her into her voyage.

There was no escort. No backup. The guild was stretched thin and they were losing entire fleets in unprecedented battles. Coureur was to handle the threat herself. Ashlandis knew that whatever they’d face would be unlike anything she had ever witnessed before. She, who had seen the might of dragons firsthand, trembled with fear. She knew that something was very wrong, but she also knew that humanity needed them; they needed the Dragon Hunters.

Days passed in silence. Everything felt wrong. The captain was quieter than ever, no encouragements, just duty. She checked on her crew as usual, she aided them as she always did, but her mind was adrift, and they could tell, but couldn’t do anything about it.

The dawn broke with a bleep of the radar.

“Contact, 2-8-5, air-vessel, seems to be the one.” called out the navigator.

“Bingo,” Cid replied.

“I’ll wake the captain.”

She stumbled out of her room, armed with a freshly brewed coffee and fighting a desperate battle against morning grogginess.

As she peered at the radar and sipped on her coffee, she nodded, “Maintain course and distance of 20 kilometers. Do not get closer until I give the order.”

“Roger that,” the navigator replied. She leaned on the railing, spyglass in 1 hand, coffee mug in the other.

“She still trembles?”

Cid queried, pulling on the sail’s rope to make sure it was tight.

“Ever since we left the port,” Ashlandis replied, taking a sip of her coffee.

“It can’t be them,” Cid responded, glancing around.

“I know,” she shot back, “But our enemy is ruthless. They’ll do anything to play us.”

“We should’ve retired after that cursed game,” Cid turned to leave, “Left it to the younglings.”

Ashy looked out to the horizon, “They aren’t ready for the horrors of the enemy, not yet. We keep losing the fresh crews while the veterans only grow older. I fear,” she began.

“We won’t lose,” Cid replied and walked off.

“Wake me when we get a visual, I’ll catch a wink for now.”

She felt a clump in her throat and her chest tightened as she looked through the spyglass. The visual was as petrifying and heart-wrenching as she imagined it to be. The name on the side of her hull read

“Marche-” the last couple of letters were missing, replaced by a gaping hole where a dragon tore through the ship’s hull. The rear mast was broken, missing. The front mast was barely intact, but there were no sails upon it, only a few remaining bits of it, like rags hanging upon a drier, flailing frantically in the wind. She could see movement, people walking around its deck, though it was too far to tell any details.

For the rest of the day, Coureur danced an intricate dance with the Marcheur, or rather what Ashlandis would describe as the ‘ghostly shell’ of it. It looked to be barely afloat, yet capable of much the same maneuvers as the Coureur herself, since Marcheur repeated every move that Ashlandis ordered her crew to make.

“Hard left, maintain distance,” and the Marcheur would mirror it.

“Hold position,” she ordered, and Marcheur did the same.

Like a twisted mirror, an alternate reality. It knew what she would do, sometimes it would begin a maneuver before she even ordered it. This dance lasted till sunset, while the crew remained on high alert, ready for anything. Slowly but surely the gap narrowed and ships got closer, still maintaining a few kilometers' safety margin, remaining firmly out of cannon’s reach.

The dusk came before long, bearing with it nightmares. That evening the crew sat in silence in the chow hall once more, readying for their restless night as the ships continued their intricate dance, keeping just outside the range of each other, but the crew was burning with anxiety of what might happen next. It was at this point that Cid spoke up, breaking the deathly silence at last, “Chef? Are we out of spices or what? It’s so, bland and tasteless tonight.”

The silence was heavier than ever before as the rest of the crew impatiently took another sip of the stew, only now realizing that indeed the meal was bland and tasteless.

“Yeah, it is,” replied the mechanic. The chef savored his meal.

“No boss, we have plenty of salt, want some more?” he tended the table with a small bowl of salt. Cid, the first hand, sprinkled some more on his food and tasted it again. The crew watched him in anticipation. He chewed slowly and meticulously.

\*

“I taste nothing,” he said, shaking his head. The mechanic dipped his entire finger in salt and licked it, “Tasteless like an old piece of badly made bread.”

Commotion arose amongst the crew, but was brought to order by a fist slamming against the table.

“SILENCE! Our enemy is playing tricks upon our minds. Double the night-watch, high alert, but get some rest,” Ashlandis ordered her crew.

That night was short and tense. Seemingly as she fell asleep, the hull of Coureur reverberated with a melody she had never heard before. Inhuman, growly, deep, and petrifying melody, a song of war, a song of dragons. Wooded hull creaked, and the planks shrieked in fright. She laid in her bunk, listening to the melody that resembled war-horns, then got up. Something was wrong, and her instincts wouldn’t let her rest till she set it right.

\*

She stepped out onto the hallway and heard the melody in new tones, more human this time. It was coming from the crew quarters. As she peered into their sleeping area, she heard one man humming in his sleep the same melody that made the ship tremble. Hesitation filled her heart for a moment, she neared the humming crewman. His eyes shot open, he glared at her, and his throat reverberated with the song. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, his pupils turned ember in color as he looked deeply into her eyes, “SHE IS WAKING,” he shouted.

Someone else leaped out of their hammock; it was one of the hunters, Leiya. Her movements were swift, she drew her knife and lunged at the captain with the precision of a predator. Ashlandis stepped back, avoiding the attack that, as she now learned, was aimed at the possessed crewmember. He blocked it with ease, his eyes burning from within.

“SHE! WILL! WEAR! YOUR! SKIN!”

\*

The shout was loud, and the crew awoke. Someone rang the bell, and Ashlandis gasped at the chaos that erupted around her in mere seconds. From sleeping calm to raging storm, her crew was up and ready for action. They were hunters, they were always ready.

“MUTINY!” someone shouted. The possessed crewmember was dragged off.

“Captain? You alright?” queried Leiya.

“All good. ALL HANDS ON DECK! FULL READY! HUNTERS EQUIP YOURSELVES!”

Hunters put on their harnesses, mobile power packs and dragon hunting lances. They lined the sides of the ship. Lights ablaze, illuminating the deck, clouds around, and the hull of the vessel. The alarm no longer rang and the silence was only occasionally interrupted with a metallic clank of the hunter’s gear.

To their surprise, no attack came. The dawn broke, and Marcheur still sat at the same distance, as if watching them, gauging their reaction, their readiness.

“This is wrong,” Ashlandis commented, watching the sun creep up over the horizon.

“How is he?” she queried. Cid scratched the back of his head, “Uh, normal? He’s normal. Awake, conscious and normal. He says he remembers nothing, not the song, not the words he spoke to you.”

The mountain peaks cast long shadows as the sun rose higher.

“Break off, put up distance, keep it just within radar range,” Ashlandis ordered. Her hand gently caressing the railing.

“Sir?” Cid queried.

“You heard me, we’re breaking off.”

“Sir!” he confirmed with a confident nod and relayed the order. The ship’s propellers roared to life as it made a sharp turn. Hunters braced, remaining at their positions, armed with power-lances, lining the sides of the ship. The Coureur was a medium sized dragon hunter, bearing a crew of 18, two shifts, two navigators, two engineers, and 8 hunters. The rest of the crew were hunter assistants and cannoneers. The hunters remained diligent on their posts despite the fact that the ship leaned heavily to the side as it turned max speed.

“Sir? The Marcheur began moving, course set to intercept us in,” the navigator hesitated, “15 minutes.”

“Adjust the course, 1-5-5, full speed ahead, keep ahead of them,” Cid called out.

“They’ve matched, they’re gaining on us, somehow.”

Cid growled, his heart began to thump in his chest, “Wind direction?”

“South, sir,” replied one of the cannoneers from outside the bridge.

“Sails down, full ahead.”

But their efforts were in vain. Every move the Coureur’s crew made, the Marcheur’s crew was a step ahead. They adjusted their course perfectly to intercept, and the ship was set on a course of favorable wind. As the distance between the two seemingly evenly matched ships decreased, Ashy had to prepare her exhausted crew.

“LINE US UP, PORT SIDE, CANNONS AT THE READY, HUNTERS TAKE COVER UNTIL WE’RE IN BOARDING RANGE. We don’t know what the enemy is, but whatever it is, FIGHT TILL THE END! Coureur will NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT!”

The crew obeyed and braced. 5 kilometers and closing.

Two kilometers and the cannons roared to life. ‘Too soon’ Ashlandis thought watching the cannonballs of the Marcheur fall short. One and a half, and she shouted

“OPEN FIRE.”

The hull creaked, the ship rocked as the cannons unleashed their fury.

Impacts send splinters flying through the air, Ashlandis watched through her spyglass in disbelief as her mentor shouted orders and organized his crew much in the same way as she organized hers. He gazed at her through his spyglass. A chill ran down her spine. It was him. Unmistakable him. Sebastian. She spent her teen years aboard that ship. She learned everything from him, and he, in turn, knew everything about her. Her nails dug into the wooden railing as splintered wood showered her. Another impact, cannonball tore through the living quarters. She could only hope her hunters survived. She adjusted the course, cannons be damned, she had to get her hands on their captain, she had to dig her claws into this illusion and learn the truth.

\*

The Marcheur did the same, turned and set course straight at them. Head-on collision was inevitable. The ship rocked, sudden impact tumbled half the crew over.

“BOARD!” she shouted, charging up to the bow of the ship and leaping onto a rope to throw herself over onto the other ship. Her hunters followed courageously, without a hint of hesitation.

Steel clashed and blood spilled within seconds. She landed on the enemy ship, with a precise roll she pushed herself forth, through the enemy ranks. Her gaze was locked on their captain, who, unlike her, was never the hot-headed type. He walked calmly behind the helmsman even as his crew engaged in a fight for their lives against the Coureur’s hunters.

Blades crossed, but his gaze remained unchanged; calm, collected, cold.

“SEBASTIAN!” she shouted, trying to throw his blade aside to gain an upper hand. He remained silent. Sparks flew as steel clashed against steel. She was relentless in her assault, albeit emotional as fury fueled her every move.

Each strike was diverted precisely. Each counter brought back memories of the times she sparred against her mentor. Of the times he smacked her on the head for the mistakes she made. Lost in her memories and the chaos of battle, she found her back against the broken mast, and Sebastian’s cold gaze scanning her up and down, searching for a weakness, an opening.

“GOD DAMN IT SEBASTIAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”

His response was a precise jab of the lance, aimed at her right thigh. She parried it, but only partly. As the cold steel bit into her flesh, a pained scream echoed through the battlefield.

“CAPTAIN!” Cid called out helplessly, fighting against the odds of two hunters stacked against him. Ashlandis fell to her knee, grasp still tight around the shaft of her lance. Memories flooding her mind. She spent her entire life fighting, training, learning, hunting. Sebastian was like a father to her. The sky itself began to weep. As raindrops fell upon her cheeks, she remembered the day she wept in the rain after losing her mother. Alone, abandoned, homeless, and lost.

It was that day, when she was but ten, that she learned of kindness in this world, and the horrors of it. The rain suddenly stopped whe a grumpy-looking man towered above her frail little body. He sneered, mocking, but not her, the life itself.

“Silly isn’t it?” he said.

“What is?” replied the little Ashlandis in between her weeps.

\*

“The rain, the world. It thinks it brought you down, it thinks it won, and here I am, a mere mortal man, telling it to GO FUCK ITSELF!”

He grinned proudly, “How about that huh?”

The little Ashlandis wiped her tears, “It did,” she whimpered.

“Not a chance,” the man replied.

“Life is fragile, but long enough to find something to enjoy. You can sit here, and weep in the rain, or you could trust a stranger and rise anew.”

He extended his hand to the small, frail child.

“Come now, let’s get you a hot meal and some dry clothes.”

She reached for him. Lightning flashed, blinding her momentarily. There he was again, towering above a small frail girl, defeated and desperate. Her grasp on the lance loosened as she reached desperately for him, “Please, no. Not by your hand,” she cried out. His body froze in place. It shimmered for a moment, turning see-through just long enough to make her doubt what she was seeing, then, he spoke at last.

“NOT BY HIS HAND INDEED! BY MINE INSTEAD!”

Ashlandis recoiled. Her mind reeled, and instincts screamed. It was not a human voice. He was not human.

“I! WILL! DESTROY YOUR KIND! I WILL WEAR YOUR SKIN JUST AS YOU DID TO MY KIND!”

The voice was deep and low, rumbling like the thunder.

“I WILL TEAR YOU—FLESH AND BONE! GRIND YOU ALL INTO DUST!”

The chaos of battle came to a halt. Silence. Short but deafening silence. Ashlandis pushed herself up, back still firmly pressed against the mast, she leaned heavily on her lance, “What in the hells are you?”

Sebastian’s body stepped aside, “I! AM! YOUR! DEMISE!” she watched him just long enough to take in his words, but then the mountains in the distance exploded, capturing her attention entirely.

Rocks flew and dust veiled what once used to be mountains, but it was swif,tly removed by a flap of titanic wings, and a roar akin to a volcanic eruption. Ashlandis froze, staring in fright at the behemoth in the distance. The dragon was the size of a mountain, unlike anything she had ever witnessed before.

“YOUR END HAS COME! I! HAVE AWAKENED!”

She gazed at her mentor once more. His body slowly turned transparent.

The ship’s mana core hummed louder.

“RETURN!” Ashalndis shouted, limping swiftly down the stairs and running toward the bow of the Marcheur, “RETREAT! BACK TO THE SHIP!” she shouted, rallying her hunters, some of whom were injured, and others no longer breathed.

Coureur jerked as the lodged Marcheur began to plummet.

“It’s lodged in us, we won’t hold for very long,” shouted the helmsman.

“Divert full power to vertical stabilizers, mana core into overdrive,” Ashlandis ordered, limping out the bridge onto the deck, “Unchain the cannons, open fire at the Marcheur, we need it gone, NOW!”

The cannon’s roared and at last, they were free of the wreck that was dragging them down, slowly but surely toward their demise. They were safe, for now, though it seemed as though this only delayed the inevitable. Ashlandis clung to the railings of her ship, watching the titanic dragon stretch its wings, eclipsing villages in shadows.

“Those towns and villages,” Cid spoke softly.

“Are doomed,” Ashlandis replied to him. Her voice shook, and every word was a struggle.

Cid glanced at her. A tear glistened on her cheek.

“There are hundreds of them,” she uttered. Cid looked at the massive dragon’s shape in the distance.

Smaller ones began to circle it and gather. There were swarms of small ones, the size of their ship, dozens of larger ones that could single-handedly wipe entire villages, and even some large enough to destroy towns.

“We have to retreat,” he said regrettably, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“We can’t help them.”

She responded with a single, weak nod.

\*

“SET COURSE FOR THE GUILD! FULL SPEED! STOP FOR NOTHING!”

Cid shouted the command.

“Aye aye sir,” replied the helmsman. A few hunters, still in full equipment, watched the scenery beneath them. The silence was loud.",1,1762397801.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1opnitv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opnitv,[selling] Nov 10-11th Military Fundraiser (please read),"I am the non-profit booster club president for our Air Force squadron. With the government shutdown and many of our end of year morale/welfare financial goals short of achieved, (and our normal fundraising events were canceled due to said shutdown) some members of the unit have volunteered their days off to support achieving our goals. We will have a tent at Lorenzi park selling military patches, shirts, lanyards, keychains, stickers, coffee mugs, memorabilia, etc. (unfortunately we’re completely out of challenge coins ☹️) Every dollar going directly to service members who need it. 

I’m also organizing a food pantry for our 300+ member squadron, many of them lower enlisted. We will accept donations of non perishables to literally support our troops as this shutdown looms on. 

Monday Nov 10 and Tuesday Nov 11 (veterans day!) we will be set up from 8am-4pm. Look for a white pop-up canopy and a table. We accept cash, Tap-to-Pay, and Venmo. We hope to arrive full of merchandise and leave full of food!

Everything donated and sold would significantly help the morale and welfare of the unit. Unused food donations will go to other struggling units on base, or to food banks once this all blows over. If you can’t make it and wish to support, please drop me a DM. I appreciate your time and hope to see you next week, even if it’s just to chat!

1opnia6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1opnia6/i_lived_in_a_haunted_apartment/,I lived in a haunted apartment,"This happened to me on Halloween night of 2018 and has haunted me ever since that night. My girlfriend and I were renting a two bedroom apartment at the time, this apartment had an upstairs and a downstairs. I spent most of my time downstairs as that's were my computer set up was. The upstairs had a bathroom, our bedroom and the second bed room which my girlfriend turned into a room were she would store her clothes, do her makeup and had a fold out futon for when we had people over. We were not allowed to smoke in the apartment but I was a pot head so I just always opened the window in the second bedroom and smoked in there. I would like to preface that I had been smoking pot for well over ten years at the time of this incident and had what most would consider a high tolerance so me smoking weed didn't cause me to feel out of the ordinary, if anything it made me feel normal.

My girlfriend at the time worked night shifts at a restaurant so I was always home alone during the nights until around 10pm on most nights. I had just finished up my shift earlier in the night and came home to relax in my normal way, Smoke a joint and scroll on my phone while hanging with my dog in the second bedroom than go downstairs to play my computer down in the computer space. This must of been around 6 or 6:30pm so it had just gotten dark here on the east coast. I light up the joint and I smoked about half of it while spacing out endlessly scrolling Instagram on my phone while I had my dog sitting next to me with the window cracked.

All of a sudden I realize that my dog has been barking for about 20 seconds and has not stopped so that got me to lose focus on the phone and to what he was barking at. Directly in-front of me is the three drawer dresser with six drop handles on it that my girlfriend stored some of her clothes in.

When I looked up the top right handle was flapping up and down COMPLETELY on its own, I was in auto-pilot mode at this point so I got up and grabbed the handle to make it stop..When I did this my entire body went ice cold like I was in a freezer..at the exact moment everything clicked in my head and I realized what was going on. I let go of the handle and the moment I do..The handle starts flapping up and down again on its own, not rapidly but in a very rhythmic motion.

I could not bolt downstairs quick enough, I went into fight or flight mode and choose flight, when I got downstairs I realized my dog was still upstairs in the second bedroom barking at this dresser so with all my courage I went back up to grab my boy. When I get to the top of the stairs I see the handle is STILL flapping up and down. I run in, grab my dog and bolt downstairs in complete shock with everything that just happened.

I went into the living room and instantly called my friend to tell him what happened, just being on the phone with someone else made me feel secure, though I was still so scared. We must of been on the phone for hours until my girlfriend got home and I was able to tell her what happened up there..I was so scared to go back into that room from that moment on, though I still had to smoke in there. I would rush back down there the second I was done and ALWAYS kept the door shut so I didn't have to look in there when it was not needed. Our bedroom was next to this room so at night I would need to walk past it quite frequently.

A few days later I was talking to my neighbor who use to live in the apartment we were renting and asked if anything strange ever happened in there while she was renting it as she lived in there for over ten years. She told me in the room upstairs a young Lady had overdosed in the early 2000's. She also told me that her sister was sick at one point and was staying with her, until she passed away down stairs one day.

I only had a few other strange things happen to me in that apartment like my coffee mug sliding across the table about a foot or so while half full, but the dresser situation stuck with me since that day. Ive tried to make a rational explanation for that night but I simply can't. Things like having the window open..but there was no breeze, and even if there was why only the top right handle move? Why did my dog notice this before I did ? why did my body go ice cold.

I wish I had got this moment on film but in the moment that was literally the last thing on my mind. My girlfriend and I were so scared she ordered some sage and made us perform a seance. We put salt on all the windows, had them open and told whatever was in that apartment to leave and that it was our home now.

I will never forget what happened to me that night and it completely shattered what I thought reality was, I was always a believer but that just cemented it for me. ",5,1762397596.0,Paranormal,4,0.86,False

1opngm7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opngm7,Jeni’s,"Pistachio Macaron
Not exactly the exact flavor of a pistachio macaron. Definitely has that almond-y taste but leans more real pistachio flavor with tiny bits of pistachio through out. Powerful salty, nutty flavor. Would buy another pint.

Cranberry Panettone w Chocolate Sprinkles
Base is a mild, sweet flavor. Not overpowering. Sprinkles give good texture but little taste. The cranberry jam is the star and makes this ice cream slightly unique and special. I still prefer Jeni’s Cranberry Crumble which I believe was last released in 2023. It had more cranberry/tart flavor and felt more festive. Without the cranberry in this one, would be very “meh”. Would still buy another pint of this because I love cranberry. 

Boozy Eggnog
Like a lighter, milder version of eggnog with hints of liquor and spices. Very “milky” on its own but I think next time I’ll pair all 3 together and it might be better mixed with something else. If you’re expecting coquito flavor, this is not that in my opinion. Would not buy another pint. 

Cold Brew w Coconut Cream (non dairy)
I’d heard good things about this one so decided to try. It’s very much a sorbet but also creamy?! Not sure how they do that but this was good. Coffee flavor is strong on its own, slightly bitter but mixed with the white coconut cream, tastes like a really good frozen coffee. Sort of just want to melt this and drink it but I won’t do that. Probably would not buy another pint and would get a coffee instead to get my fix!

1opng68,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1opng68/20251105_dreary_day/,2025/11/05 dreary day,"dreary days are good cooking weather and nice for the kinds of food i like which are mostly braised or soups or big pots of things.  these are also usually budget friendly and don't take much effort or skill but do take a lot of time so if you're stuck inside, they're perfect.  

i find i'm not cooking much meat lately which is partially because of the price and also, if it's not the main feature, i really don't feel like it adds much to things.  for me, it seems like the meal is either all meat or no meat.  i don't see the point of mixing meat into things if it's going to be in the background and especially if it's just ground beef, which is where my price point maxes out.

i did, however, take out some ground beef from my freezer drawer to thaw and i'm planning on making the most dreaded meal in my repertoire: mashed potatoes with creamed corn and a hamburger patty.  this is what i had for dinner *way* too often as a kid.  like *way* too often.   there's nothing inherently wrong with it, to me at least, it's just the frequency it was made and eaten.  after a decade without it, it's really not that bad.  on the other hand, i might just enjoy a hamburger since i have buns and could use the potatoes to make a curry, but... we'll see.

this morning i had my [sawdust breakfast ](https://imgur.com/q07kjbJ)with raisins, an apple, yogurt and coffee.  [lunch](https://imgur.com/AHrWGx6) same as yesterday, a bean burrito and blood-looking jello but i went lighter on the beans.  [dinner](https://imgur.com/9qQgtlp) was this soup i used to make all the time with a mix of dried split peas, lentils, beans and rice with whatever vegetables and aromatics you want (everything needs onion).  i was planning on eating this with fresh bread so i was in the process of making some and had another [coffee](https://imgur.com/9CUE891).  i was getting close to being done but my mom offered me this other bread from a local shop made by someone in the neighbourhood and oh my god it was amazing.  if you can make it. i don't feel like bread is ever worth buying at the store but this was worth buying.  later on had a slice of [carrot bread](https://imgur.com/YBYnRN4) and, surprise, another coffee.

1opnefc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Leather_6292/comments/1opnefc/this_chair_literally_saved_my_wfh_life_jones/,This chair literally saved my WFH life. (Jones Massage Executive Chair Review),"Alright, so I need to rave about this for a minute. I'm a graphic designer, and like a lot of you, I've been fully remote since... forever ago. My setup was decent except for one glaring, painful problem: my chair.

The old one I had was some generic ""executive"" thing from a big-box store. It looked fine, but after 8+ hours of being parked in front of Figma and Illustrator, my lower back was in open rebellion. We're talking a constant, dull ache that would flare up into a sharp pain whenever I shifted. I was popping Advil like candy and seriously considering a chiropractor. My focus was shot because half my brain was always dedicated to the discomfort.

I was desperate. I started digging for chairs that actually *actively* helped, not just had ""lumbar support"" as a bullet point. I stumbled on the **Jones Massage Executive Chair (2025 Upgrade)** from Kinnls and was kinda skeptical. Massage? Heating? Seemed gimmicky, but I was at my wit's end.

https://preview.redd.it/y117erdmvjzf1.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f42096b76f61b4e6ab0d5633de2c8765378e684

Guys. It is NOT a gimmick. This thing is a miracle worker.

Let me break down the two features that fixed me:

**1. The Massage Function:** It's got these vibrating nodes right in the lumbar area. You can control the intensity. When I feel that familiar tension building around 2 PM, I just lean back and hit the button. It's this deep, rhythmic vibration that just *unlocks* all the tightness. It's not a aggressive, jackhammer massage—it's more like a steady, soothing kneading. I can keep it on a continuous mode or set it to pulse. It's made those long crunches before a deadline actually bearable. I don't have to stop working; I just get a massage while I fine-tune my kerning. It's insane.

**2. The HEAT. Oh my god, the heat.** There's a heating pad built into the lower back. On days when my back feels especially stiff and cold, I turn this on. The warmth just seeps in and melts the pain away. It's like putting a heating pad on, but it's perfectly positioned and I don't have to mess with cords or a microwavable bean bag. Using the heat and massage together is the ultimate combo. It feels like my spine is getting a warm hug after years of being abused.

The difference after a month with this chair is night and day. The chronic pain is just... gone. I'm actually comfortable at my desk now. I'm more productive because I'm not distracted by my own body, and I finish the workday feeling tired from work, not crippled by pain.

**TL;DR:** Was a graphic designer with back pain so bad it was messing with my job. Bought the Jones Massage Chair for the gimmicky-sounding features. The massage and heating functions are 100% legit and have completely eliminated my back pain. Worth every single penny. If your chair is trying to murder your spine, do yourself a favor and check this one out.

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",5,1762396852.0,nosleep,1,0.86,False

Hey Maximizame crew,

Been thinking a lot about how we treat life like a video game. We're all just trying to gain XP, unlock achievements, and level up, right? But sometimes it feels like we're stuck on the same level, grinding away without making much progress.

For a long time, I tried to separate **productivity** from **happiness**. I'd hustle hard all day, feel burnt out, and then wonder why I wasn't happy. It took me way too long to realize they're not separate quests—they're part of the same main storyline. A happy brain is a productive brain, and a productive life often leads to a happier you.

Here are a few ""hacks"" I've picked up that have seriously helped me gain XP in both areas. No fluff, just stuff that actually works for me.

**For Crushing Your To-Do List (Productivity 📈):**

*   **The Two-Minute Rule:** This one's a classic for a reason. If a task pops into your head and you know it will take less than two minutes to complete, **do it immediately**. Answering that email, putting the dish in the dishwasher, making that quick call. It clears up so much mental clutter.
*   **Embrace Single-Tasking:** We've been sold a lie about multitasking. Trying to do five things at once just means you're doing five things poorly. Pick ONE thing. Set a timer for 25 or 45 minutes and give it your full, undivided attention. The focus is insane.
*   **Define Your ""One Big Thing"":** Before you even open your laptop, ask yourself: ""If I only get ONE thing done today, what will make me feel the most accomplished?"" Do that thing first. Everything else is a bonus.

**For Protecting Your Peace (Happiness 😊):**

*   **Schedule ""Do Nothing"" Time:** We schedule meetings, workouts, and errands. Why not schedule downtime? Put it in your calendar. 30 minutes to just sit, listen to music, or stare out the window. It's a non-negotiable appointment with yourself.
*   **Log Your ""Tiny Wins"":** Before you go to sleep, write down or just think of one small thing that went well that day. Did you enjoy your coffee? Did a stranger hold the door for you? Did you finally fold that pile of laundry? It trains your brain to look for the good.
*   **Master Your Inner Game:** This is the big one. All the productivity hacks in the world won't help if your mind is a chaotic mess. It's not about a single trick but about understanding your own emotional patterns. I found that having a structured plan to manage my thoughts and feelings was a game-changer. If you're feeling stuck on this, I really got a lot out of **this resource (affiliate link)**. It helped me build a solid foundation for my mental well-being.

Ultimately, leveling up isn't about some massive, overnight transformation. It's about the small, daily choices that stack up over time.

So, what are your go-to hacks? What are the small things you do to feel more productive and genuinely happy? Let's build a master list in the comments. 👇",1,1762396795.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I purchased the following during the recent 50% sale on the site:

02. Seven Samurai (1954) - Thick booklet containing eight essays from critics, historians and filmmakers 

97. Do the Right Thing (1989) - Thick booklet containing an essay, production photos and a facsimile of Spike Lee’s production journal 

396. Ace in the Hole (1951) - A one-sheet that folds into a decently sized newspaper with essays 

555. Sweet Smell of Success (1957) - Thick booklet with an essay, two of Ernest Lehman’s short stories about the characters and an excerpt from Alexander Mackendrick’s On Film-making book 

700. Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) - Thin booklet filled with production art & photos, an essay, an article by Wes Anderson and the White Cape comic Ash reads from the film

1030. Scorsese Shorts - Thin booklet with an essay and rarities from Scorsese’s personal archives 

1161. WALL-E (2008) - Thin booklet with an essay, script notes, production artwork and excerpts from Andrew Stanton’s production sketchbook



The others I kept seeing mentioned were:

654. Repo Man (1984) - contains an essay, Alex Cox’s illustrated production history and a interview with an actual repo man. The film itself just isn’t to my taste, so I gotta pass on that one. 

The Ingmar Bergman’s Cinema Set has a book. Not a small booklet, but an actual, coffee table-esque book that someone already uploaded to the Internet Archive a few months back

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",1,1762396589.0,WBAdventures,0,0.67,False
1opn4w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1opn4w3/my_journey/,My journey,"My Year-Long Health Journey – Finally Looks Like H. Pylori

Hey everyone,
I wanted to share my story because it’s been a long, confusing year and I feel like I’m finally getting some answers. Maybe someone’s been through something similar.

How it all started

It all began around October 2024. I noticed swollen lymph nodes, a tight throat, and this weird feeling like it was hard to swallow. I got tired easily, felt drained all the time, and had constant body aches. All started day I went to GYM than my neck just cramped up I just felt weird and paranoid and next day I was with my friends and I was smoking weed and drinking energy drink and boom out of nowhere my throat just got tight out of nowhere got me scared, than from that day I stayed home thought I had an infection went to a GP he just said it’s just an infection I’m like Ok I waited 
A few weeks later, I developed ear ringing (tinnitus), random chest and rib pressure, mild gum bleeding, and occasionally spat up yellow or bloody mucus. 
Than I went to ER they told me to go to an GP so I went to a different one  and the GP prescribed Cilicaine VK (phenoxymethylpenicillin 500 mg) for ten days thinking it was an infection, but the symptoms didn’t really go away.

The weird unsteady feeling

After that I started getting this strange unsteady or light-headed feeling like my body was slightly off balance when walking. I saw a chiropractor and then an osteopath, who said it might be from tension in my neck and ribs. The osteopath did dry needling, and it actually helped loosen things up for a bit.
They also told me to walk daily, eat spinach, take magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc, and do light resistance training. I started doing that and noticed small improvements, but that unsteady feeling still came and went.

My lifestyle before all this

I’ll be honest before all this happened, I was a frequent weed smoker. I used to smoke daily, often on an empty stomach, and didn’t eat properly afterwards. I think that messed up my gut badly. My diet was all over the place, I barely ate proper meals, and I relied on coffee and cigarettes to get through the day.
Over time, I feel like that lifestyle triggered some kind of gut damage and inflammation, and my immune system started to crash.

Cause of that I’ve quit weed. 

Months of tests and confusion

From October 2024 through most of 2025, I went through countless tests blood work, rheumatology markers, throat and nasal swabs, and even a Monospot test for glandular fever. Everything kept coming back “normal” except my RF (rheumatoid factor), which was slightly high around 20 IU/mL both times (a year apart).
Doctors thought it could be something autoimmune, but nothing was conclusive.

By mid-2025 I had accepted that something deeper was going on — probably gut-related. I started focusing on gut healing: bone broth, black seed oil, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, and fish oil. I even did lymphatic drainage and started using colostrum and prebiotics to rebuild my gut lining. Please take black seed oil guys it’s very beneficial 

The H. pylori clue

Then around August 2025, i went to see a different GP ordered a urea breath test for H. pylori. The result came back “Low Positive (54 DPM, ≤ 50 is normal)”, which means there was definitely some bacterial activity. The doctor told me to repeat the test in six weeks  which still showed the bacteria was present, though not extreme. It made total sense. All my symptoms lined up  gut pain, random body inflammation, fatigue, nausea, even that unsteady feeling. Everything felt connected through the gut sometimes I feel sharp pain on my chest thinking it’s my heart. I was feeling like my joints and nerves around my arms and knees

Where I’m at now

As of today (November 2025), I’m on Day 4 of a 7-day triple therapy for H. pylori. The plan is to kill the bacteria completely and then rebuild my gut properly with prebiotics, probiotics, and nutrient-dense food. I’ve completely quit weed and caffeine, and I’m cutting back on cigarettes too. Haven’t smoked since started this therapy 

I’m eating clean, staying hydrated, and focusing on recovery — not just physically, but mentally too. I’ve realised how much the gut, nerves, and immune system are linked together. Do your sports, exercises gym whatever it is guys 

What I’ve learnt is don’t ignore chronic fatigue, weird gut feelings, or “invisible” symptoms.
Antibiotics help only if you fix your lifestyle afterwards — especially diet.
Weed, poor eating, and stress destroy your gut over time. Healing takes patience — supplements alone won’t save you if your habits stay the same.

If anyone’s dealing with similar symptoms — chronic inflammation, dizziness, random joint pains, throat tightness, or anxiety after gut issues please check for H. pylori. I wish I had earlier.",2,1762396554.0,HPylori,2,1.0,False

Feels like the line between long term rentals and serviced apartments is getting thinner.

I stayed in one in London last year, and it was weirdly perfect for digital nomads, gym, coworking spot, even a coffee bar in the lobby. But at the same time, it felt too polished, like you’re renting a lifestyle instead of a home.

I keep wondering how this shift hits small hosts. If big developers start offering hotel style perks with flexible leases, will it squeeze out smaller Airbnb style operators, or will people still prefer something more personal?",1,1762396440.0,UniqueRentals,0,1.0,False

I guess I don’t mind it all that much since I’d rather put up with that con over feeling icky. I use Almond Breeze unsweetened original milk for my everyday homemade coffees and I never have that issue.

Katie’s Cars&Coffee is a car meet that holds every Saturday morning 6-9AM in Falls Church, VA. 

I am a hyper car enthusiasts, I found this is actually one of the most exotic Cars&Coffee event in the country (or at least east coast) and it is indeed crazy, you can basically find anything there and talk to the owners. Classic, Hyper-cars, JDM, American Muscle,Hot rod,Motorbike and even RC toys.
I post some pictures I took down below so you could check out.

It is hold in FallsChurch, VA, in front of Katie’s Coffee House,  (760 Walker Rd, Great Falls, VA 22066 ) unfortunately in early morning there is no public transport, it is about a half hour drive from foggy bottom, the uber bill is about $30-40 to the way there and $10-15 to the way back to the metro station (Wiehle-Reston Station) near by when we comeback. So it will be $40-55 in total.

If any of you guys are interested you could join this GroupMe chat,(The last picture above) I will leave in 6:30AM in District House, and maybe we could go together. 

You don’t necessarily need to go every weekend, just text me in the group chat that if you are going or not.

 Decided today to try making a baby blanket for a friend whose expecting next month. Itll be my first big project and boy am i already feeling the ache.

Im loving colour changing yarns and particularly like this one but does it actually look okay? what do you guys think before it gets too big? Im not 100% sure how to figure out the best way to get these kinds of yarn to work nicely into a pattern.  I like how it reminds me of a fancy coffee but its definitely not coming out quite like i expected.  The more i look at it the more unsure i feel seeing as its going to be a gift.

Part of me wants to scrap this for a solid colour until i know how to properly use colour changing yarn but, on the other hand these 9 rounds took me 4 hours.

In the case of 7-11, their Arabica coffee is actually pretty good.  I do sometimes upgrade to the select coffee.  I don't mind paying a little more if I actually enjoy the coffee.

However, I don't really care for Amazon's upgrade.  In my opinion, it tastes worse than their normal coffee.  Of course others might disagree and that's fine.

What I have a problem with, is that many, if not all Amazons are now defaulting to the premium coffee and slapping a 25 baht fee on top.  Every time I have to say, no I want the normal coffee.

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",0,1762395926.0,TheDarkArchive,0,0.5,False

“Dude, you good?” I asked.

He hunched forward on the edge of his bed, controller dangling from the cord, shoulders shaking. For a second I thought he was laughing. Then he spat something wet into the trash can.

“It’s just that stupid flu,” he rasped. “Half the school’s got it. Chill.”

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and clicked resume like nothing happened.

On the TV, our characters were pinned behind a burned-out truck while some NPC screamed about incoming armor. Colors flashed across the posters on his wall—Bring Me the Horizon, a faded Cardinals pennant, that old VHS horror movie one with the guy in a welding mask. The room smelled like Little Caesars, old socks, and that fake blue raspberry from his vape that always made my tongue feel coated.

Another cough tore out of him. Longer this time. Deeper.

“You want, like, Tylenol or something?” I asked.

“I took three already,” he muttered.

His skin had this too-shiny look, like the sweat wasn’t drying. I tried to tell myself it was just the heater and two guys in a small room with the door shut.

Outside the second-floor window, the orange streetlight threw its little circle across the cul-de-sac. Normal Friday stuff: a car easing by toward Route 9, somebody’s porch light flipping on, the flicker of a TV in the house across the street. If you leaned just right you could see the green glow of the Dollar General sign down by County Road 12.

I almost convinced myself everything was fine.

Almost.

The helicopter had gone over around six. We’d been walking back from the Shell station next to the closed-down Subway with two Monsters and a crinkling bag of “BBQ Blast” chips that tasted like burnt sugar and lighter fluid.

We heard it before we saw it: heavy blades chopping the air low enough that the big plastic tooth on the “Sunset Arms Dental” sign actually rattled.

We both looked up.

The helicopter slid across the sky just above the bare trees. No big white numbers on the tail, no hospital logo, no sheriff star. Just a dark, matte body and glass that reflected the dull sky back at us.

“Probably National Guard,” Cole said. “My dad said they use the industrial park sometimes for… I don’t know. Drills.”

He said it too fast. He kept watching it until it slid behind the tree line anyway.

On the walk back we passed three black SUVs and a dark box truck lined up along the curb outside the walk-in clinic—the one that still had the old Blockbuster drop slot bricked over. No logos. Tinted windows. I didn’t see plates on two of them, but I wasn’t trying that hard to look.

The waiting room was full. People were lined out the door under the buzzing “Maple Family Care” sign. A kid in a Paw Patrol hoodie sat on the curb, coughing into his sleeves. A teenage girl in scrubs leaned on the brick, scarf pulled up over her face, eyes half-closed. An older woman sat on the cement planter breathing like each inhale was a chore.

“Flu’s going around,” Cole had said. “Guess it’s bad this year.”

One of the guys near the SUVs had a clipboard. Another carried a silver hard case with latches, the kind you see in movies when someone opens it and there’s a glowing vial or a bomb or something that ends the world inside. When we walked past, he shifted so the case was turned away from us.

No one smiled. No one said hi. They watched us like we were walking through someone else’s crime scene.

“Maybe the President’s getting his flu shot here,” I joked. It sounded dumb as soon as it left my mouth.

Cole huffed, but it wasn’t a real laugh. We kept going.

Now it was almost midnight and we were back in his room, acting like none of that mattered.

Outside, something howled again.

This time the sound rolled all the way down Maple Crescent from the direction of the ballfields. It wasn’t a dog. I’ve lived here my whole life—I know what the neighbor’s German shepherd sounds like when it goes nuts at the mailman, and I know the yappy terrier two houses down, and the half-feral mutt that sometimes runs along the chain-link fence.

This wasn’t that. It was deeper and too… wide, somehow. It felt like it came in under the walls and pressed into my chest.

We both stopped moving, controllers slack in our hands.

“You heard that, right?” I said.

“Probably that coyote that keeps getting into our trash,” Cole said, eyes already drifting toward the window.

“I’ve never heard a coyote sound like that.”

He unpaused the game on autopilot. Our characters immediately got lit up and died.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand.

He picked it up, squinted at the screen, and swore under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Mom. She says Dad’s not coming home tonight. Plant’s got some ‘incident,’ he’s covering the line.” He dropped the phone and it bounced on the comforter. “She always freaks out. Last year a guy dropped a wrench and she acted like it was Chernobyl.”

“How’s she freaking out if she’s sending emojis?” I said.

“You’ve met her,” he said, but there wasn’t much energy in it.

I had. She was the type to keep a Rubbermaid tub of canned goods in the garage “just in case” and lecture you about staying hydrated. I used to think it was annoying. Lately it felt… I don’t know. Safer, maybe.

Another sound came from outside; not the howl. Closer. A scraping, like something heavy being dragged along the asphalt and then picked up again.

Cole hit pause again.

“Okay, that’s not the coyote,” he said.

He got up and pulled the curtain back two fingers’ width.

I stood next to him, looking over his shoulder.

From his room you could see the loop of Maple Crescent where it curved back toward County Road 12. The streetlight hummed louder than I remembered. The McKees’ blue Corolla was pulled halfway onto their front lawn like someone had come home in a hurry and just stopped. Driver’s door open. Their front door open too, porch light on, the hallway behind it dark.

“That’s weird,” I said.

Across the way, Mr. Duran’s house had every light on like a Christmas display. Kitchen, living room, upstairs bedrooms. The curtains in the front room were open, and for half a second, I swear I saw someone standing right up against the glass, forehead nearly touching it.

I blinked. They weren’t there.

“Maybe somebody’s big dog got loose,” Cole murmured, like if he said it soft enough it would be true.

He sniffed, hard. It rattled in his sinuses.

“You really don’t look good,” I said.

“My mom said it’s a twenty-four-hour thing.” He shrugged and instantly winced. “Chills, fever, everything hurts, then you’re fine. She keeps making soup like… whatever.”

He turned away from the window too fast and grabbed his desk to steady himself. The pens in his mug rattled.

“You okay?” I asked.

He squeezed his eyes shut. “Head feels like it’s full of bees,” he said. “And my teeth hurt. Is that a thing? With the flu?”

“Your teeth?”

“Yeah. Like the roots,” he said, rubbing his jaw. “Feels like they’re… I don’t know. Pushing.”

When he looked at me, his pupils seemed bigger than earlier. His eyes were glassy, the whites shot through with red. A red flush was creeping up his neck like a sunburn that hadn’t been there an hour ago.

“Maybe we should tell your mom,” I said.

“Then she’ll send you home,” he said. “And then I have to throw up alone.”

Outside, the howl came again. Closer. It made the windowpane vibrate just enough that the little suction-cup football on the glass gave a tiny squeak.

The lights dimmed for a second, then came back.

There was a knock and his mom pushed the door open without waiting.

“You boys okay?” she asked.

“Yeah,” Cole said fast. “We’re good.”

She had one hand on the doorframe. I noticed her fingers pressing in like she needed to lean on it. Up close, she didn’t look good either. Her skin was shiny and pale at the same time. Sweat darkened the neckline of her hoodie. There was a damp patch near her collarbone that hadn’t dried.

I could smell chicken broth and onions drifting up from downstairs. Under that was something else. Coppery, sour, like when you forget ground beef in the fridge for a week.

“You hear the sirens earlier?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “What happened?”

“Nothing you need to worry about.” She smiled, but it pulled weird at the corners. “Just… stay upstairs, okay? Don’t go outside. If either of you start feeling worse, you tell me right away.”

She looked at Cole when she said that.

“You should lay down,” she added. “You’re burning up.”

“I’m fine,” he muttered.

“You’re not.” She stepped closer and pressed her palm to his forehead. “Cole, you’re…”

She trailed off, touch lingering a second too long.

“Hot, yeah, I know,” he said, trying for a grin and missing it by a mile.

She glanced at me. “Evan, if you start feeling off at all, I’ll call your parents, okay? There’s… something going around.”

“Okay,” I said. My voice came out thinner than I meant.

Another siren wound up somewhere far off, then cut out. It sounded wrong—too short. Not like the weekly test from the firehouse.

The howl came again, nearer, and I watched Ms. Harding’s eyes flick to the window.

That bright, everything-is-fine expression slipped for a second. Underneath was bare fear.

“That sounded close,” I said.

She swallowed. “Stay upstairs,” she repeated. “Please.”

She shut the door gently.

We listened to her footsteps going down. They sounded slower than usual, like she was watching where she put her feet.

“You’re officially freaking me out,” I told Cole.

He sank down to sit on the carpet, back against the bed, hands laced behind his neck. Sweat soaked through his t-shirt. His breathing had gone short and quick, like he’d jogged up a hill.

“You know when you get a fever and your whole body aches?” he said. “Take that and multiply it by, like, ten. It feels like my bones are humming.”

“I don’t think bones are supposed to do that,” I said.

“Thanks, WebMD.”

“You want water?” I asked.

He nodded, swallowed, and grimaced. “Feels like I swallowed sand,” he muttered.

I grabbed his Spider-Man cup and stepped out into the hallway.

The house sounded different. The usual background stuff—the fridge, the heater, the distant TV—was there, but muffled, like everything had been wrapped in blankets.

The stairway was dim. Only the little light over the stove showed from downstairs, a soft square of yellow. The TV in the living room played a muted news broadcast; I could see the reflections flashing on the framed family photo by the stairs.

I got about halfway down before I heard the voice.

“…containment perimeter around the south sector—”

A man. Not his dad. His dad had this smoker-rough baritone. This was smoother and flat, like a customer service rep reading from a script, if customer service ever talked about perimeters.

“It’s my son,” Ms. Harding whispered back. “You can’t just…”

“You were informed of the risks when you agreed to keep the subject in-district, ma’am,” the man said. “Protocol is clear. Anyone showing pre-conversion symptoms—”

“Pre… what?” she asked. “You didn’t say that word before.”

“Fever. Chills. Myalgia. Photophobia. Aggression. We’ve covered this,” the man said. “You watched the briefings. We’re past contact tracing. We’re at mitigation. For your safety and theirs, stay inside and wait for pickup.”

“You didn’t say it would be like this,” she said. Her voice cracked on “this.”

“You were given the stipend,” he said. “You signed the NDA. We’re doing our part. Do yours.”

There was a scrape, like her chair moved. “He’s just a kid.”

“So were the others.”

The helicopter thundered over the house again then, closer than before, making the hanging light over the dining table sway. A white beam washed across the ceiling.

I ducked back up a step into the shadow of the wall without even thinking about it.

The man’s tone sharpened. “They’re here,” he said. “Stay away from the windows. Do not open the door for anyone who isn’t wearing a respirator. And whatever you hear out there, do not let him outside.”

The back door opened for a second. Cold air slipped through the house; I felt it reach all the way up the stairwell and brush my bare toes.

Then the door closed.

I stayed there long enough to hear his footsteps fade and the quiet, shaky sound of Ms. Harding trying not to cry, then I backed up the stairs, skipping the squeaky one on autopilot, and went back to Cole’s room without the water.

He’d slid off the bed and was half-curled on the floor, forehead pressed to the carpet like he was trying to cool off.

“You look worse,” I said, because I’m a genius.

He barked out a laugh that turned into a cough halfway through. “Thanks.”

Sweat had plastered his hair to his forehead. The skin around his eyes had gone faintly purple. I could see his pulse pounding in his throat.

“Everything hurts,” he said. “My jaw, my back, my… I don’t know. Inside my elbows. Who even has muscles there?”

“You need a doctor,” I said.

“Clinic’s full. Mom said they turned people away.” He swallowed and winced. “She said, ‘We’re at capacity.’ Like we’re a hotel.”

We both sat quiet for a second.

The word turned that I’d heard downstairs sat in my head like a small stone.

Before I could say anything else, another howl fractured the night. It sounded closer, almost on top of us.

The heater clicked off. The silence afterward felt thick.

Then something scraped along the siding.

We both heard it. Slow, deliberate. Claws—nails—something—pulling down from the eaves toward the window.

Cole’s breathing shifted into quick, shallow gasps.

“Get away from there,” he hissed.

I moved back from the glass.

The scraping stopped.

The quiet that followed lasted too long. Every second without a sound made my heartbeat seem louder.

Then something slammed into the window.

The glass bowed inward with a heavy thud. The curtain puffed into the room, pressed by a mass on the other side. A growl vibrated through the wall, low and wet. It felt like someone humming against my bones.

“Jesus,” I whispered.

The sound changed. Snuffling. Heavy breath smeared across the glass. The curtain darkened in spots where warm moisture hit it. Claws tapped along the frame.

Cole scrambled backward, heels slipping on the carpet until his back hit the closet door. His fingers dug into the drywall. Little crescents of white dust dropped to the baseboard.

“Don’t move,” I mouthed, like that would help.

We stayed there until my legs started to shake.

Then, somewhere farther down Maple, a gunshot cracked the night.

The thing at the window went still.

Another shot. Then a third. Short, controlled bursts.

Someone shouted—not words I could make out, just a command tone.

The weight pulled away from the glass.

Scraping tracked back up the siding, then across, then nothing.

I only realized I’d been holding my breath when my vision narrowed and my ears rang.

I dropped onto the bed.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

Cole lifted his head. His pupils were blown wide, almost swallowing the brown. Tiny flecks of gold swam near the edges, catching the weak light from his desk lamp.

“My skin feels wrong,” he whispered. “Like… like it doesn’t fit right.”

He shoved his hand under his shirt and raked it across his chest. Red welts rose up immediately.

I grabbed his wrists. “Stop,” I said.

“It itches,” he snarled.

The sound wasn’t completely his. It came from somewhere lower, like something else was using his vocal cords.

“You’re sick,” I said. “You’ve got whatever this flu is. That’s it.”

He stared at my hand on his wrist like he was trying to remember what he was supposed to do with it. His jaw flexed. For a heartbeat, I thought he was going to lean forward and bite.

Then he sagged, shoulders dropping.

“Sorry,” he whispered. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing.”

Downstairs, the TV suddenly blared the shrill tone of an emergency alert. The noise drilled up through the vents into his room. The flat voice that followed was too muffled to make out completely, but the pattern was familiar.

This is not a test.

Cole let out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. “We’re so screwed,” he said.

Another cough hit him, full-body. He turned his head out of habit, but a warm mist hit my forearm. When I wiped it on my jeans, it left a smudge that was more brown-red than pink.

“Cole,” I said. “You’re coughing up blood.”

He glanced at the trash can. The inside was streaked dark, slow drips working their way down.

“Guess I should’ve gotten the flu shot at Walgreens,” he tried.

It just sat there between us.

Outside, more gunshots. A deeper roar, like something big and furious.

The helicopter passed overhead again, lower. The whole house shook. Dust sifted down from the corner crack. The rotor wash made the window rattle in its frame.

Voices blared through a loudspeaker now.

“—remain inside your homes. Do not attempt to leave the area. This is a temporary quarantine—”

Cole snorted. “Yeah. Temporary. Sure.”

We sat there, listening to our own breathing and the distant chaos, until the scraping came again.

Not outside.

In the hallway.

I stood up so fast spots flashed in front of my eyes.

The door was closed. The strip of light underneath had a dark break in it, like something was blocking part of it.

Scrape.

Then a little bump against the wall.

“Mom?” Cole called. “You okay?”

Silence.

“Stay here,” I said.

He grabbed my ankle, fingers burning hot through my sock. “Don’t open the door,” he said. “Seriously.”

“I’m just going to look,” I said.

“That’s what dumb people say in horror movies right before they—”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, which didn’t help my case.

My hand shook on the doorknob.

I turned it a fraction of an inch. Just enough to widen the gap at the bottom.

Something sniffed on the other side.

Right there. Inches away.

Warm, wet breath puffed under the door. The smell hit me immediately—copper, wet fur, and rot, like roadkill left under a heat lamp.

I let go of the knob so fast it snapped back.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re staying in here.”

The tapping moved away from the door, toward the end of the hall, each step making the older boards creak in that specific way I knew from years of avoiding them when sneaking late-night snacks.

A door latch clicked open.

“Tom?” Ms. Harding’s voice floated down the hall, thin and uncertain. “Is that you?”

What answered was a wet, eager rumble.

Then she screamed.

It was short. Cut off like someone hit pause on her life.

Something heavy slammed into the wall. The impact made the posters in Cole’s room jump. Thud. Drag. Thud. Drag. The sound of weight being pulled over old wood.

“Don’t tell me,” Cole whispered. “Don’t tell me what that is.”

I didn’t.

There were other sounds after that. Tearing. A crack like a branch snapping. Wet crunches that went on too long.

The noises went on and on. At some point the emergency alert downstairs stopped. The helicopter noise moved farther away for a minute, then closer again. Somewhere in the neighborhood, a car alarm started wailing and then choked out.

Eventually, the sounds in the hallway went quiet.

At some point in there, Cole stopped shaking.

When I looked at him, he was sitting up against the closet, breathing slow, eyes unfocused.

“I think it’s in my head,” he said.

“What is?” I asked, even though I already sort of knew.

“Not voices,” he said. “It just feels like… something is pushing from the inside. Like it’s right up against everything, testing it. If I stop fighting it for even a second, it’s going to take over. It feels like there’s something just… pressed up inside my skin, waiting for me to open the door.”

We both looked at his hands.

His nails were noticeably longer now. The tips had gone thicker, darker, almost a dirty gray. The skin over his knuckles was red and stretched tight.

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said.

“Get in line,” he muttered.

We sat there a minute more, both listening to the silence in the hall.

Finally I said, “We can’t stay here.”

He looked up at me. “You just said—”

“In here,” I said, gesturing at the room. “Whatever that is out there? It was just at your door. If it comes back…” I glanced at the window. “We go out. Roof, then down. Back yard.”

He closed his eyes. “I can barely stand up,” he said.

“I’ll help,” I said. “I’m not leaving you.”

He let his head thump back against the wall once. “This is such a bad idea,” he muttered.

“Yeah,” I said. “So is waiting to be dessert.”

That at least got half a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

We moved slow. I got the window up. Cold air spilled in, smelling like smoke, wet leaves, and metal.

I climbed out first, onto the shingles. The roof had that rough grit that gets in your palms. The streetlight made everything weirdly bright and dark at the same time—orange circles and sharp shadows.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

He swung his legs out. For a second he wobbled, hands clenching on the frame so hard his knuckles went white. I grabbed his forearm.

His skin almost burned.

We worked our way down the slope into the dark over the back yard. From here we could see the fenced rectangle of grass, the above-ground pool under a sagging tarp, the narrow strip between their fence and the Durans’.

“On three,” I said. “One—”

He dropped.

He did it on purpose or his legs just gave out. Either way he hit the grass hard enough that I heard air whoosh out of him.

“Cole!” I hissed, sliding down and jumping after him.

He lay there for a second, then rolled onto hands and knees. His fingers dug into the dirt like he was anchoring himself.

“I’m fine,” he grunted. “Move.”

We crept along the fence line toward the back gate. The neighbor’s little bark-machine dog was silent. That bothered me more than anything.

At the gate, I eased the latch up and nudged it open. It squeaked way too loud.

We both froze.

Maple Crescent didn’t sound like my street anymore. No distant TV, no car doors, no dog barks. Just wind, the far-off thump of the helicopter, and every now and then, sounds I didn’t want to label.

We slipped through the gate into the narrow gravel alley that ran behind the houses. Trash cans, recycling bins, the smell of oil and grass clippings. To the left, the alley curved toward the woods and ballfields. To the right, it opened toward the street.

“Which way?” I whispered.

“Trees,” Cole said automatically, nodding left. “Woods, then highway.”

We started that way, shoulders brushing fence posts.

Halfway down, I heard something ahead.

A wet, tearing sound. Heavy breathing.

I motioned Cole down behind a tipped recycling bin and peeked around it.

Behind the McKees’ house, near their back porch light, something hunched over a shape on the ground.

At first I thought big dog. Then I saw the hand. Just a hand, fingers slack, half-buried in the wet grass under the thing’s front paws.

Whatever it was moved in tight, jerky motions. Its back rose and fell, spine bulging. Wet ripping noises came with each bend of its neck. I caught a flash of Mr. McKee’s shirt in its claws.

Cole’s hand clamped on my jacket. His nails dug through the fabric.

“Back,” he whispered. “Back, back, back—”

We edged away, trying not to crunch gravel.

Gunshots popped out on Maple—short bursts. A shout. The thing by the porch froze, ear—or what was left of it—twitching. It sniffed the air.

I held my breath until my lungs burned.

It went back to eating.

We kept moving, the alley suddenly feeling too exposed.

At the end, near the woods, harsh white light cut across the trees. Not streetlight orange. Floodlights.

We ducked behind the last fence and peeked.

Men in dark gear had set up a checkpoint across the opening in the trees. Two trucks nose-to-nose blocking the path, floodlights on stands, one of the black SUVs from the clinic parked sideways.

They wore helmets with dark visors, rifles with thick tubes on the barrels. One held a device with a glowing little screen and swept it across the woods, then back at the houses.

“Eastern perimeter sealed,” he said. “No movement past the fence.”

“Copy,” someone answered. “We’ve got three confirmed conversions inside the block. Orders are containment first, cleanup after.”

I thought about the woods beyond the trucks, the highway, the way we used to cut through there to hit the gas station. All of it slammed shut.

“Can we get around them?” I whispered.

Cole shook his head, then winced, hands going to his temples. “Too loud,” he breathed. “Their radios, the… everything. I can hear… I don’t know. Heartbeats?”

He gagged and pressed his forehead against the fence.

“You okay?” I asked.

He shook his head. “My skin hurts,” he said. “My back hurts. My eyes hurt. Your… smell is too much.”

“Wow, thanks,” I said, because my mouth didn’t know what else to do.

“Not like that,” he said through his teeth. “I can smell… everything. The trash. The… blood. You.”

His pupils were huge again, almost eating his irises.

We couldn’t go forward. We couldn’t go back without passing the thing behind the McKees’ porch.

“Side yards,” I said. “Cut across to the street. See what’s going on. Maybe there’s a gap.”

He made a noise that could’ve been agreement.

We slipped between two garages and came out into the Durans’ back yard. Their kitchen light was on. Through the window I saw Mr. Duran on his knees, hunched, shoulders heaving. For a second I thought he was praying.

Then he snapped his head up toward the ceiling, jaw straining. His fingers flexed against the tile, nails scraping sparks.

His back moved like something underneath was pushing out.

I grabbed Cole’s sleeve and pulled him past, staying low along the side of the house.

At the gap between the Durans’ and the next place, we could see Maple Crescent proper.

It didn’t look like my street.

A sedan up on the curb, hazard lights flashing. Another car with its driver’s door hanging open. Someone’s Christmas lights still nailed to the gutters, blinking colors over nothing.

Things moved in the spaces between.

A guy in a bathrobe stumbled near the Stephens’ mailbox, clutching his stomach. He dropped to all fours mid-step and retched dark fluid onto the pavement. His spine arched. His shoulders jerked in two directions at once. His jaw worked, then snapped open wider than it should as his teeth shifted.

He screamed once and the scream slid into something else.

Under the streetlight, something already finished paced, lifting its head to sniff the air. I recognized the torn pajama pants on its hips; Mrs. Duran had worn them out to get the mail a hundred times.

Beside me, Cole dug his nails into the stucco. He was breathing hard, nostrils flaring.

“I can smell them,” he whispered. “They smell… wrong. Sweet and rotten. You’re… different.”

“Different how?” I asked.

He swallowed. “Just… different.”

Down the street, near the McKees’ front yard, a squad of dark-gear guys moved into view. Same type as at the woods. One carried the boxy scanner. Another had the canister.

From behind the Durans’ SUV, we watched them fan out.

“Three signatures inside,” the scanner guy said, pointing at the McKees’ house. “All red.”

“Do it,” the one in charge said.

The canister guy stepped forward and sprayed the front of the house. Fog hit the door and windows and froze, spreading in white sheets. The door shook once from the inside, then again. On the third hit, something burst through and froze mid-leap, encased in ice.

“Subject class Lycan-Three confirmed,” the scanner guy said. “Tag for retrieval.”

We were close enough to see him slap a round device onto its side. It blinked green.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “If they sweep this way…”

“They’ll see us,” Cole finished.

We slid along the Durans’ SUV, using it as cover. Every bit of gravel under my shoes sounded too loud.

As we passed the back wheel, someone shouted, “Movement! Southeast side!”

For a second I thought they meant us and my legs locked.

A snarl came from farther down the circle. Something crashed through a side fence by the Culpeppers’ yard.

Half the squad pivoted toward the new sound.

“Go,” I hissed, pushing Cole toward his front yard.

We cut across the strip of grass between the Durans’ place and his.

Up close, his house looked wrong. Front door closed, but faint smears on the handle. Living room blinds crooked. Porch light flickering.

A low sound rumbled from inside.

“We’re not going in the front,” I said.

He nodded quickly. “Garage,” he said. “Side door.”

We skirted the porch and ducked down the side of the house, back into shadow.

The side garage door was locked, but it was the cheap kind. I’d watched Cole kick it open once when he’d forgotten his key.

“Think you can…?” I asked.

He stared at it, chest heaving. Then he lifted his foot and drove it forward.

The wood around the latch splintered. The door flew inward and banged against something.

He nearly fell with the kick. I caught him under the arm.

“Adrenaline,” he muttered. His hand shook.

Inside, the garage smelled like oil, old grass, and that same sour metallic hanging in the air. We squeezed through, past his dad’s red toolbox and the bikes, and up the three steps into the mudroom.

From there, we could go straight into the kitchen—or up the narrow stairs to the hallway near his room.

We both listened.

Something moved upstairs.

A dragging step. A wet sound.

We looked at each other.

“Roof,” I said.

The mudroom ceiling had an access hatch. We’d used it before to watch fireworks over at the high school.

I dragged the little step stool over with my foot. It scraped tile.

We froze.

Upstairs, the movement paused.

My heart pounded in my throat.

After a long second, the dragging resumed, going the other way down the hall.

I climbed the stool and pushed the hatch up. Dust dropped in my face. The attic was dark—insulation, beams, the outline of roof above.

I pulled myself up, then reached down.

“C’mon,” I whispered.

Cole’s hands closed around my wrists. That too-hot, electric feeling surged again, something under his skin pushing toward me.

I gritted my teeth and hauled him up.

We crawled across the attic on our hands and knees, trying not to think about the thin drywall between us and whatever was below.

At the far end, near where his room sat over the garage, a little dormer window looked out onto the front roof. We squeezed through one at a time.

The air outside felt even colder after the attic. From here, we could see almost all of Maple Crescent.

It looked worse from up high.

Streetlights slicing orange circles out of the dark. Cars at weird angles. A trash can on its side, cereal boxes and junk mail scattered and soaked.

Shapes moving in the gaps.

Some still vaguely human, staggering. Others not.

Down the block, the squad at the McKees’ had moved on. Another squad swept along the street, scanners casting pale cones in the air.

“I’ve got multiple yellows in this sector,” one said. “Probably all exposed.”

“Then we’re behind,” another answered.

“That’s Harding’s place up there, right?” a third voice said. “Where zero-six-three’s registered?”

“Yeah. We hit that one last,” the leader said. “Command wants a live pickup.”

The numbers didn’t mean anything at first. Then Harding did.

“Harding,” I said.

“That’s my name,” Cole said, like he needed to hear himself say it.

We lay there on the sloping roof, watching strangers move through our street like it was a training ground, listening to howls and screams. The shingles dug into my palms. Cole was slowly overheating beside me.

“Where do we even go?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Sweat rolled down the side of his face.

“I don’t think we do,” he said finally. “Not really.”

He tensed suddenly, a fresh wave of tremors rolling through him. His spine bowed. His fingers flexed against the shingles.

“Okay,” he gasped. “Okay, that’s… worse.”

“You need to lie down,” I said.

“I need a sedative or a bullet,” he whispered. “Not necessarily in that order.”

“Not funny,” I said.

“Little bit,” he said, lips peeling back in almost a grin, all teeth.

Footsteps pounded on his front steps.

We both jerked our heads toward the sound.

A fist hammered on the front door below. “This is a health and safety team!” a voice called, muffled. “Please open up. We’re here to help!”

From inside the house came a low, rumbling growl.

The squad on the street went still.

“Hostile inside,” someone said. “Sounds like full conversion.”

The leader swore. “They always think they can hide it.”

“Harding boys!” the one by the porch yelled suddenly, louder. “We know you’re in there! Come to the door!”

“They’re talking about me and my dad,” Cole whispered. “They don’t know you’re here.”

I thought about walking down, opening the door, saying I was just the friend like that would matter.

“Not a chance,” I said.

The guy on the porch knocked again, harder. “Ms. Harding, open the door! You signed the release forms. You know what happens if you don’t comply!”

Something slammed into the door from the inside. The wood cracked.

“Back up!” someone shouted.

We didn’t see the breach from this angle, but we heard it. Crash. Snarling roar. The flat thud of their guns. Wet impacts.

The frost canister hissed again. The snarling cut off mid-note.

Cole squeezed his eyes shut. “I heard my mom die twice,” he said. “Once in the hall, once just now.”

I didn’t answer.

He wiped at his face with the heel of his hand. Little dents marked his cheek where his fingers had pressed too hard.

“Maybe they can fix it,” I said, even though I didn’t buy it. “They keep saying ‘pre-conversion.’ That has to mean something. Like there’s a point where they can still… stop it.”

“You actually believe that?” he asked.

I thought about the guy in the kitchen with the silver case. The word stipend. The phone voice saying collateral. The squads freezing people like they were spraying for roaches.

“No,” I said. “But I just watched an ice gun freeze a werewolf mid-jump, so my Believable Meter is busted.”

He snorted softly. “Fair.”

Below, inside the house, boots moved, glass crunched, voices called “Clear!” in different rooms.

Someone walked into his bedroom. I heard the faint squeak of his bed springs. A second later, a voice said, “Negative on upstairs contacts. Windows open. They’ve moved.”

“Their grid still shows them,” another replied. “Two yellow signatures within twenty meters.”

“Roof?” someone suggested.

“Check it,” the leader said. “We need zero-six-three alive. And if he’s got a friend, that’s a bonus sample.”

Bonus sample.

I felt Cole flinch.

“Okay,” I said. “We need a plan.”

He let out a weak laugh. “We had one. It was ‘don’t die.’ Zero out of ten, terrible execution.”

Boots hit the gutter.

“On the roof! I’ve got movement!” a voice shouted.

Rifles swung up. Red dots jittered over the shingles.

“Hands where we can see them!” someone yelled. “Do not jump! We are here to secure you!”

At the end of the block, another helicopter hovered, lower than any medevac I’d ever seen. Its side door was open. A figure stood harnessed in the doorway, watching.

Even from here, I could make out the symbol on his vest: a triangle cutting through a circle, tiny text wrapped around it.

On the side of the helicopter, barely a shade lighter than the paint, were two words.

THE DIVISION.

The name hit some dusty corner of my brain. Late-night internet rabbit holes. Comments under videos that vanished. “Division scrubbed this.” Threads about private response teams that always got locked.

“Last chance!” the guy in the doorway boomed through a bullhorn. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Cooperate and you might survive this!”

Might.

Cole let out a short, wrecked laugh. “We’re screwed either way,” he said. “At least with them, maybe I don’t… you know. Wake up with you in my teeth.”

His voice slid lower on the word teeth. His jaw clicked.

I tightened my grip on his arm before he could drop onto his hands.

“Okay,” I said. “We go with them. We see what this Division actually is. And if they try to turn you into a lab—”

“Wolf,” he cut in, a flicker of old sarcasm. “Lab wolf. Get it right.”

“Fine,” I said. “If they try, we figure something out.”

He actually grinned at that. It was wrong and too toothy, but it was still him.

“Harding boys!” the leader shouted from below, not even close on my name. “On your stomachs! Hands behind your heads! Now!”

I looked at the logo on his vest. That neat little triangle-through-circle thing. The words underneath: THE DIVISION.

Somewhere, somebody sat in an office with that logo on a coffee mug. Someone designed it in Photoshop while listening to a podcast, having no idea what it would look like under a streetlight like this.

For them, this street was probably a dot on a map, an incident report number. For us, it was the only place we’d ever lived.

“Guess we’re subjects now,” I muttered.

Steam curled from Cole’s breath in the cold air even though my own didn’t.

“Yeah,” he said. “Guess we are.”

We lay down on the shingles side by side, gravel biting into my cheek. I laced my hands behind my head. Red dots from rifle lasers danced over my sleeves.

The helicopter shifted, its shadow swallowing the orange streetlight until everything went flat and gray. The rotors made my ribs vibrate.

Somebody shouted, “Copy, moving in,” in a voice like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Inside, something—whoever was left inside—howled one last time. It broke off mid-sound, cut by the soft roar of the frost spray.

Boots pounded onto the roof. Gloved hands yanked my wrists together. Plastic cuffs bit into my skin. I heard the soft hiss of a syringe and Cole’s breath hitch, then go heavy.

Maple Crescent blurred. Streetlights, frozen shapes on lawns, the green glint of the Dollar General sign way down at the corner. All of it framed by that logo on black gear.

Later, they’d toss words at us: outbreak, anomaly, exposure event. They’d show us paperwork with big black blocks where the good parts should be. They’d say “no way to have predicted this” even though they’d had the trucks and the tech ready.

But I was there when the black SUVs lined up outside the old Blockbuster. I heard the man in the kitchen say subject like my best friend was a piece of equipment. I saw THE DIVISION painted on the side of the helicopter before the sedative hit.

None of this was a surprise for them.

They were waiting.

And somewhere under my skin, under Cole’s, under this whole town, something else was waiting too—sniffing at the edges, scratching at the door.

It started on a regular Friday night at a friend’s house while we argued about video game loadouts and shared a bag of terrible chips.

By the time the sun came up again, Maple Crescent was just another block on some Division map, and I wasn’t just a kid having a sleepover anymore.

I was part of whatever this is.

And I can’t stop thinking about all the other streets that look just like ours, where somebody’s kid is coughing right now and somebody’s mom is being told “it’s just the flu,” and somewhere above the trees, you can barely hear rotors you’re not supposed to notice.",0,1762395723.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,0.5,False

———

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days blur together like water running over glass. The clocks all say different things, and no matter how long I stay awake, the sun never sets the same way twice. 

Sometimes it fades, sometimes it stalls, sometimes it just blinks out like someone threw a switch. But I’ve stopped caring what time it is. The only thing that matters now is getting out.

The first thing I tried was walking. I filled a backpack with water, food, a flashlight, and left the car parked in front of the motel. I followed the main road out of town until the pavement gave way to gravel, then to dirt, then to nothing but pine needles. The air grew thicker the farther I went, like I was wading through it instead of breathing it. 

After a few miles, I stopped seeing the treeline altogether—just more road stretching ahead, perfectly straight. When I turned around, the town was already back in sight, the church steeple poking above the trees like it had never left.

The second day, I tried driving at night. I thought maybe whatever was happening only worked while the sun was up. I drove until the gas gauge hit empty, headlights cutting through the fog, but when the car sputtered out, I was parked in front of the diner again. 

The lights were off, but Edna was still inside, standing by the window with that same polite smile. She didn’t move when I honked. Didn’t blink. Just watched as I sat there, trying not to scream.

The third day, I started leaving marks—spray paint arrows on the asphalt, branches snapped in half, rocks stacked into crude little towers. Every time I circled back, they were gone. The town had smoothed itself over, neat and pristine again. Even the mud on my shoes would vanish if I looked away too long.

That was the first time I noticed something else: people calling me by name. The motel clerk said, “Morning, Jessie,” like it was the most natural thing in the world. I hadn’t told him my name.

When I went to the diner for coffee, Edna asked if I’d slept better last night. I told her I didn’t think I’d mentioned that I wasn’t sleeping. She smiled. “Oh, you must’ve. You always tell me everything, sugar.”

The way she said “always” made my skin crawl.

I left half the coffee sitting there and went to the gas station to ask Hank if there was another route—maybe a back road, maybe a dirt path out through the woods. He pointed at a wall map I could’ve sworn wasn’t there before.

A red line cut straight through town and looped around like a noose. At the bottom, scrawled in pencil, was a name I didn’t recognize. But Hank tapped it like it meant something to me.

“Your granddad helped build this road, didn’t he?”

I stared at him. “What?”

“Sure did,” he said cheerfully. “Helped lay the first gravel himself. You come from good stock, Jessie.”

I backed out without another word. When I turned around, the map was gone.

That night, I drove again. The sky was black this time, not the pale gray it usually was, and the stars looked wrong—too close, too many. I kept my eyes on the road until I saw the WELCOME HOME sign, its wood clean again, paint shining fresh under the headlights. For a second, I thought I saw movement behind it—a silhouette, human-shaped but not human still. When I blinked, it was gone.

I got out of the car and tried to tear the sign down. The wood felt soft and wet, like it had just been painted. When I pulled my hands away, the paint clung to my skin, red instead of white. I ran back to the car, drove until I couldn’t keep my eyes open, and ended up parked at the motel again. The clerk waved from the window when I stumbled inside.

“Rough night?” he asked. “You always did push yourself too hard.”

He said it like we were old friends.

I didn’t answer him. I went straight to my room, locked the door, and sat on the edge of the bed until the light started leaking through the curtains again. My hands still looked stained, the red gone darker overnight, like it had sunk under the skin. 

The mirror above the sink showed a man who hadn’t slept in weeks—eyes hollow, face drawn, jaw tight enough to ache. For a second, I thought the reflection was breathing slower than I was.

In a moment of weakness, frustration, and anger I reared my arm back and smashed the mirror with my bare fist. The sound barely echoed. 

For a second, I just stared at what I’d done. The glass had splintered in a spiderweb of cracks, thin lines radiating out from the point of impact where my knuckles had gone through. Blood slid down the glass in narrow threads, catching the weak yellow light like it was rust instead of red. 

My hand throbbed, pieces of silvered glass still stuck in the skin. I tried to wash it off, but the water from the tap ran cloudy, smelling faintly of metal. When I looked up again, the cracks in the mirror seemed to shift—like they were trying to pull together, to mend themselves around the reflection of my hand.

By the next morning, it was whole again.

That’s when I started testing everything. I left the motel with my phone recording video, drove out of town, turned the car around, and played it back. The footage showed the road leading out just fine—until it reached the woods. Then the screen flickered, the camera refocused, and suddenly I was driving past the diner again. I replayed it three times. The same thing happened each time, like a film reel stitched in a loop.

Later that afternoon, I parked in front of the church. The bell was silent, but I could feel the air vibrating around it, like the sound was waiting to happen. I went inside and looked at the painting again. The figure’s face was blank now—no eyes, no mouth, just smooth, unfinished skin. I took one of the candles from the altar and pressed it against the frame. Wax dripped across the image, thick and slow.

The next morning, the painting was perfect again.

Edna waved when I passed the diner. “How’s your mama doing, Jessie? You said she wasn’t feeling too good last week.”

I froze. I hadn’t spoken about my mom since I left home.

“I didn’t—” I started, but she just smiled that same gentle smile, tilting her head. “Sure you did, sugar. You must’ve forgot.”

I left without answering. I could feel her eyes on me all the way back to the car.

By the end of that day, I’d tried breaking every window on Main Street. Each one shattered under the tire iron, sharp cracks echoing down the block. I thought maybe if I wrecked enough of it, something would have to change. But the next morning, every pane was whole again. My arms were sore, my hands blistered, and the town looked untouched.

That was the first time I heard laughter. Not loud—just soft, somewhere in the air around me. Like a child’s giggle carried on the wind. It followed me down the street, through the gas station, all the way to the car. When I turned the ignition, it stopped.

On the fifth morning—if it was morning—I found mail in the motel’s drop box. A plain white envelope with no stamp. My name written neatly across the front. Inside was a photograph.

Me, standing beside Edna in front of the diner. The same pose, same angle as the one I’d seen on my phone’s background the first day. Only now, Hank and the sheriff stood in the background, smiling like a family portrait.

People greeted me differently after that. The man sweeping his porch called me neighbor. The kids on the bikes yelled my name before riding off. Even the sheriff tipped his hat and said, “Good to see you out and about again.”

Again.

I didn’t stop driving after that. I went through the woods, across fields, through backyards. The roads didn’t matter anymore; the town rearranged itself no matter which way I turned. Once, I crashed through a fence and ended up in someone’s garden, but when I looked up, the diner was across the street. The smell of frying oil filled the air, and Edna stood in the doorway, wiping her hands on that same rag.

“You’ll hurt yourself, sugar,” she said. “No need for all that fuss. You’re home.”

That word again. Home.

The car would be parked somewhere new—the gas station, the church, sometimes in front of the motel again. Each time, the fuel gauge reset to half a tank, no matter how far I’d driven. My hand had started to heal wrong, the skin along my knuckles tightening into pale scars that almost looked like lines of writing. When I stretched my fingers, it stung, but the pain was grounding. It reminded me I was still real, at least for now.

Sometime after what I think was the eighth day, I saw something different. The town square—if you could call it that—was crowded. People stood talking in pairs, kids played tag near the church steps. The air smelled faintly of cut grass and something sweet, almost like apples left too long in the sun. 

For a heartbeat, it looked normal. Then I realized every face was turned toward me. Not directly, not in unison—but each one found me eventually. Eyes following me as I crossed the street. Smiles widening. Nods exchanged like I’d just come home from work.

Edna waved from the diner window. Hank lifted his coffee in greeting. Even the sheriff was there, leaning against his car.

“Morning, Jessie,” he called. “Good to see you out early.”

I didn’t respond. I just kept walking, pretending not to notice that some of them were whispering my name, their lips moving in unison as they spoke.

By that afternoon, I found a new photo waiting under my windshield wiper. This one showed me standing in front of the church, wearing the sheriff’s badge on my chest. The ink was still wet when I picked it up.

That night, the bell rang again. Three times. I counted. The sound was deeper now, like it came from under the ground instead of above it. I looked out from the motel window and saw shadows gathering at the base of the steeple. Dozens of them, still as statues. When the last toll faded, they all turned toward me at once.

I drove. Didn’t even grab my bag this time. The headlights flickered as I tore down the road, past the diner, past the sign. The trees blurred together until they looked like a single dark wall. The air buzzed in my ears, thick with static. I thought I was making progress—I felt it. The odometer was ticking up, the temperature dropping, the fog thinning.

Then I saw someone standing in the middle of the road ahead.

For a second, I thought it was the sheriff again. But when the beams caught him, I saw my own face looking back.

He was dressed like me, same jacket, same bloodstained hand. He smiled faintly, raised a hand in greeting, and walked toward the diner on the right side of the road. I saw Edna open the door for him.

I don’t remember deciding to move. I just slammed the gas pedal. The car roared forward, trees whipping by, the engine screaming as I tore past the sign. The world seemed to twist for a moment—everything bending inward, folding itself around the sound of the tires on asphalt.

Then it was gone.

The trees opened into a wide expanse of gray sky, and ahead of me was a familiar stretch of highway. My phone buzzed in the passenger seat, the first service I’d seen in days. A green exit sign flashed by. I slowed down, shaking so hard my hands slipped on the wheel.

For a long time, I just drove without thinking—past billboards, past rest stops, until I saw another car again. A minivan with a family inside. The sight made my throat tighten.

When I finally pulled into a gas station, the world looked normal again. Real sunlight, real sound, the smell of fuel and hot pavement. I sat there until I could breathe without trembling. Then I glanced at my phone.

My lock screen had changed. It was a photo of me, standing in front of the diner. Only this time, I wasn’t smiling.

Behind me, through the window, I could see the other version of myself sitting at the counter, waving.

I kept thinking about him—the other me. The one who walked down the street like he’d been born there. He moved with this calm, unhurried ease, smiling when people called his name, laughing at things I couldn’t hear. The way Edna leaned toward him at the diner window, the way Hank clapped him on the shoulder—it was all so natural, like it had always been that way. I realized then that the town hadn’t been trying to keep me there. It had been trying to make me there. Each loop, each morning, every detail it learned about me was just another stitch, sewing me into its memory until I belonged. And now that it had what it wanted, I can’t stop thinking about why.",25,1762395685.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False
