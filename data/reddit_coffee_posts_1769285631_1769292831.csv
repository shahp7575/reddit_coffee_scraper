1qm0md1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodieDestinations/comments/1qm0md1/best_cheap_burgers_in_toronto_2026_top_eats_under/,Best Cheap Burgers in Toronto 2026: Top Eats Under $15,"Let's talk about the elephant in the room: burgers in Toronto have gotten ridiculously expensive. I recently paid $24 for a basic cheeseburger at a popular spot downtown, and honestly, it wasn't even that great. With inflation hitting our wallets hard, finding a quality burger under $15 in 2026 feels like winning the lottery.

But here's the thing—affordable, delicious burgers DO exist in Toronto. You just need to know where to look.

I've been on a personal quest over the past several months to find the best budget-friendly burgers in the city. I'm talking about proper, quality burgers with fresh ingredients, juicy patties, and actual flavor—not sad, frozen hockey pucks on stale buns. And I'm happy to report that Toronto still has some absolute gems serving incredible burgers without breaking the bank.

What surprised me most during this burger journey was discovering that some of the cheapest burgers were actually among the best I've ever had. These aren't corner-cutting operations—many of these spots grind their beef fresh daily, make their own sauces, and genuinely care about every burger they serve. They've just made the conscious decision to keep their prices accessible, and that's something worth celebrating and supporting.

The spots on my list include everything from old-school burger joints that have been serving the community for years to newer fast-casual places bringing fresh energy to Toronto's burger scene. Some are tiny hole-in-the-wall spots with just a few seats, while others are larger restaurants where burgers are just one part of an impressive menu. What they all have in common is exceptional value—you're getting way more quality than the price tag suggests.

I've included burgers of all styles in this guide. Classic smash burgers with crispy edges, thick pub-style burgers with gourmet toppings, no-frills diner burgers that nail the basics, and even some creative specialty burgers that prove affordable doesn't mean boring. Whether you prefer your burger simple with just cheese and pickles or loaded with bacon, mushrooms, and special sauces, you'll find options that'll make your taste buds and your wallet happy.

Each burger on this list is under $15, and many are even cheaper—some of my favorite finds clock in at just $8-10. That's the price of a fancy coffee and pastry these days! I've tested these burgers at different times, checking for consistency, and I'm confident recommending every single spot on this list.

Beyond just listing the restaurants, I've included details about what makes each burger special, what to order, approximate prices, and locations across Toronto. I've also noted which spots offer meal deals (burger + fries + drink combos that are even better value) and which ones have the best sides to pair with your burger.

For students, families, or anyone watching their budget in 2026, this guide is your ticket to enjoying great burgers without the guilt of overspending. For burger enthusiasts who just want to try more spots without emptying their bank account, this is your roadmap to Toronto's best-kept affordable secrets.

The Toronto food scene can be expensive, but it doesn't have to be. Supporting these affordable burger spots means encouraging more restaurants to keep their prices reasonable while maintaining quality. It's a win-win for everyone.

1qm0lj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microdiscectomy/comments/1qm0lj8/day_4_postprocedure/,Day 4 post-procedure,"Hey everybody, I wanted to share an update.

I’ve read many times that day three is the toughest, and I can absolutely agree. Day three was extremely difficult. 

I was very sore at the incision site and throughout the surrounding surgical area, and the stiffness was intense. Even though I’ve been instructed to walk at least 15 minutes three times a day, and I’ve done that consistently since day one, yesterday was brutal. 

I only made it out of the house in the morning after some coffee and then spent most of the rest of the day in bed.

Icing, staying on top of my prescribed pain medications, and using lidocaine patches on my lumbar area did help, but overall yesterday was rough.

Fast forward to today. While I was a little stiff this morning, I’m doing great. I’ve even managed to get some chores done. I’ve been using my grabber and was able to hang some clothes that my wife washed for me.

And then!!!!! my first shower since the procedure! I removed the bandage, and the incision site looks fantastic. I just let soap run over it without scrubbing or irritating it, and it felt amazing to finally have it out of the bandage and able to breathe a bit.

I still can’t believe how relieved my sciatica pain is at this point. There’s just the slightest bit of tingling, but it honestly feels like my leg is just thrilled to be awake again.

Day four is easily the best day I’ve had since getting home. I truly think yesterday was the worst of it, and I’m hopeful things will continue improving before my next update.

Thank you all so much for the support. I’ll continue sharing the benefits of this procedure. It was easily one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, especially when I think about where I was just a month ago.",1,1769292696.0,Microdiscectomy,0,1.0,False

Looking at this video a bit closer, you'll see a stocky agent with a grey jacket, hat and dark pants.  At 0:27, he kicks what looks like a travel coffee mug out of the way.  At 0:30, you can see what I believe to be one of the victim's magazines on the ground, near the agent's foot.

Shortly thereafter, I believe he sees the gun and moves in to retrieve it.  At 0:40, the agent can be seen walking away with what appears to be a gun, presumably that of the shooting victim.

Now here's what \*may\* have happened, and I'm just not sure.

Also at 0:40, it's possible that the stocky agent fired one round accidentally from the retrieved handgun.  The video is not conclusive, but based on the position and movement of the gun, this appears to be a possibility.

Other agents, having been made aware that the man was armed and now believing that he was shooting, open fire on him.  This would explain the gap between the first single shot, and the volley of shots that occurred after a brief delay.

1qm0huj,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_partners/comments/1qm0huj/im_getting_so_tired_how_do_i_handle_this/,Im getting so tired... how do I handle this?,"TW: mention of threatened suicide 

Hey all 

My partner drops into these depressive holes after a variety of things - an argument with me or his brother, overwhelmed with work, etc. He will seem like hes dissasociating for days at a time - barely works, mopes around the house, wont eat, and wont respond to my light energy and kind gestures like lunch, snuggles, teas, etc.  

He is reactive in nature and multiplies things that are wrong. For example, if I was to say something like I feel sad or hurt by what you said, he would immediately jump into ""but look at all that i do, im not appreciated! What about everything i did for you today?!"". Continuing on and on until we get to a point where he finally sees his reaction has caused us to fight. Hes not the only reason - I definitely have lost patience over our 3 years together, and sometimes will raise my voice to get to him which clearly fuels the fire. 

This we had a big problem where he threw my love back at me, accused me of things, said I dont love him, etc etc etc. I became stoic in showing him what happened and it told me everything I needed to know about myself. 

I love him dearly, but I can no longer be the emotional strength. I want to soften and feel safe in my communication. Yesterday we went through the motions and it seemed to be impactful for him. He finally made the therapy appointment I've been nearly begging him to book and he said a lot of healing things. 


Today? He does some lovely things for us like make coffee and get started on the work to be done today, but continues to mope around while we do some work outside - minimal eye contact/minimal smile. He had a very sweet moment where he came to me at one point, but went back to moping. The second I told him im sad because I thought id see him today, it all went south. 

He told me yesterday to tell him when he is going down the wrong mental path. I called it out, we fought about it. He asked me to tell him what was wrong (which hurt enough as it was) and the second I tell him in a very thoughtfully and lovely way, he says to me ""because you didnt get what you want and are making a huge deal out of nothing"", ending with him telling me he was going to put a gun to his head and walking towards where they were. Having been on our hips moments ago (we live in the mountains and working outside today), I followed behind him and took them off the counter while he cried with his head on the front door. 


Im at a loss. I know he is working on it and I have seen improvements, but also weeks of delays in booking his second therapy appointment after finding one he actually liked. This is not the first time he has threatened suicide and told me he has for years, but ""would never actually do it."" I dont feel like I have emotional safety. I am fearful to be vulnerable and open my heart. Ive become stoic in how I handle these situations with him, showing little emotion.

I liked her I initially and I asked her out but she was already in a relationship so I left it at that. We saw each other weekly and we did develop a pretty good friendship.

 After class was over I asked her if she would want to hangout sometime and she said yes so we would occasionally meet up, like maybe once or twice a month or every other month but I kept it respectful and platonic. I never made a move or anything because I knew she was taken and I was genuinely happy just being friends. She ended her relationship around this time last month and a couple days ago we hung out and got coffee.

 I ended up saying that if she was up for it I would really like to take her out sometime but I know she just got out of a relationship so I understood if she needed time. She said that she didn't want to date right now and just wanted to be friends and I was completely cool with that and we left it at that on good terms. 

I texted her later and thanked her for understanding and that I was here for her as a friend and she texted me back saying she understood and she appreciated that i understood that she just wanted to be friends and that I was cool with it. Things were good and I left it at that. 

Yesterday I asked if she would want to hangout together again this week and she told me that after she had some time to reflect she rethought her response and she said that she felt kinda disrespected by both being persued while in a relationship and right after she got out of it. I responded by saying 

""Hey, I just wanted to say that I am sorry, for what it's worth I wasn't trying to get with you while you were in your relationship, I never wanted to interject myself in the middle of that. I genuinely thought you were a cool person to talk to and hangout with and even if there was a little bit of attraction there I never would have acted on it. If all we were going to be was just friends and nothing more I was cool with it. And as for the other day, I'm sorry that I said anything. I just wanted to be honest with you and I tried to say it in a way that was respectful to you and what you were going through and I really wasn't expecting anything from you in return. I'm sorry if I betrayed your trust and I understand if you don't want to see me anymore.""

""And I understand why you feel the way you do, I just want you to know I never had any ulterior motives and feelings can be complicated so I just wanted to be honest and I was 100 percent cool with just being friends without any lingering feelings. But like I said, if you don't feel up for being friends anymore I understand and would respect that.""

I feel kind of bad and kind of wish I didn't say anything at all because I think I just ruined our friendship but I just kind of thought since she wasn't in a relationship now it wouldn't hurt to at least ask and see what she would say and it seemed like she was initially cool with it but now I think I made her uncomfortable.

1qm0gka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1qm0gka/egocentrism_combined_with_narcissistic_traits/,Egocentrism combined with narcissistic traits,"I apologise for the ramble, and sincerely thank you in advance for reading. 

Egocentrism for me is one of the hardest personalities to deal with at friendship level. Quite honestly, it depletes my soul.

I’m the main supporter in a very good friends support network, and I have been completely and utterly worn out with constant monologues of a “crisis” they are dealing with, and it has been an ongoing saga for 5 months. From 8/9am until 9pm every day, I’m receiving constant text and voice messages with updates and new developments in the “crisis”. The crisis in question is something almost every single person on the planet has to go through (old age cognitive decline in an elderly parent).

I myself, unfortunately, have a clinical diagnosis of PTSD and OCD following witnessing a prolonged, avoidable, and traumatic death as result of fatal medial negligence. It’s something I do not speak about, but I did tell my friend about my diagnosis at the time (I was diagnosed a couple of months ago after seeking help 3 years on from the incident). My friend responded to my message with a message saying they believe they have PTSD from the ongoing elderly parent crisis.

I believe my own diagnosis is making this situation all the more difficult to deal with. This person has absolutely no capacity to engage in any conversation that does not centre around his “trauma” from the parental “crisis”, and had actually gone as far as to show me text message conversations where another friend has spoke of their own unrelated issues, and my friend shot them back a really nasty message, completely ignoring their dilemma (which was quite an emotional issue) and instead saying “I don’t have the capacity to listen to this. My parent is ill”.

It got to a point where the catastrophising and monologue of worst case scenarios caused me to feel like I was back in the moment where I witnessed the death that caused my PTSD. I told my friend, directly and descriptively, that the made up scenario they just described has caused me to relive having to handle the body of my loved one, and that I think they need to seek help to cope with their extreme anxiety. They didn’t acknowledge what I said, and instead continued speaking about themselves.

I am at a complete loss. I’m trying to navigate my own symptoms, and this saga is making me more and more reclusive, hyper vigilant, and is causing me to relive some of the most traumatic memories of the events I witnessed. Unfortunately there is no dedicated support for PTSD outside the NHS, and so I’ve been completely alone in trying to navigate this whilst I await my slot becoming available with a psychologist for trauma focused CBT therapy. 

I could write a book about every single major crisis this person has dealt with, it’s not just this one event. Even going for a coffee becomes a spectacle with a 4 paragraph Facebook post about the unbelievable things they saw whilst getting said coffee.

Is there any hope for someone who is suffering from egocentrism?

In my desire to understand and give reason for my friends behaviours, I’ve gone down a rabbit hole, questioning if perhaps I’m the one with the personality issues given how much it’s affecting me. I’ve completed a big five test, the results are: 

Neuroticism: 64

Extraversion: 74

Openness To Experience: 89

Agreeableness: 110

Conscientiousness: 107

I don’t know if this means anything.

1qm0e61,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1qm0e61/i_need_to_lose_4060lbs_this_year/,I need to lose 40-60lbs this year,"From Septemberish to now I’ve lost 25 pounds. I started off around 215 and now I’m 190. I’m 5’2 F so I’m still a decent amount overweight.

I’d be happier at 160, so only 30 pounds but I think my ultimate goal is to be closer to 140 I don’t think weight any less than that is realistic now that I’m almost 30.

I no longer drink soda, which was a really big crutch for me. I subbed out a super sweet morning drink for à la colombe coffee which is still sweet but a lot less sugar than I used to drink.

I eat twice a day at 11 and 5ish with no snacking in between. I do occasionally have a snack sized piece of candy to satisfy my sweet tooth.

I work out around 3 times a week at barre, my goal is to do 144 classes over the year.

I guess I don’t know what to do to keep my weight loss going or any ways to speed it up. Maybe by summer I’ll be at the 160, but I keep hearing that people stall with their weight loss and I’m not sure what to do about that. I’m eating about 1000 calories a day.

1qm0bga,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1qm0bga/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

the cake is a simple chocolate cake i got from [sally's baking addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/triple-chocolate-layer-cake/), i just added maybe 3/4 of a cup of dark chocolate chips i put through my nutribullet to compliment the coffee frosting. the frosting is an adaptation of [sally's coffee buttercream](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/espresso-chocolate-chip-cake/). i didn't think the coffee flavor was strong enough, so i added about a cup of whipped cream with a shot of espresso mixed in to make the flavor more coffee-forward and the texture lighter and fluffier. i melted semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips, spread it on parchment paper, and used cut-outs to make the flowers. chocolate covered espresso beans were used for the centers of the flowers as well as additional decor for the cake, plus dark chocolate chips in their whole form as well as processed for the sprinkling on top.

This will be just rant from my burner acc.
I'd like to hear some options because I'm confused af.
A year ago me (35f) started working at this new company,where i met this woman (40f).
She works at a different compartment of the company so  i see her every 2nd week for a couple of minutes.
We clicked immediately for some reason, our behavior was kinda flirty,from both sides, the looks we would share,the compliments,the sweet talk,i felt like there were crazy sparks/ tension between us that we would both try to hide when others were around us. As the time went on we got along pretty well and i found myself coming to her house for coffee and gossip, alot. (She invited me ofc) . Now, 8 months ago i got divorced from my ex husband, she is also divorced with grown kids. I was pretty relaxed the whole time and didn't initiate anything,but there is this other friend of hers (f43) that acts possessive over her and she brought up how her friend's behaviour is weird and that she is not attracted to women. At that point i was even more confused by everything,like there is no way i  imagined all of this stuff between us. And we were both single at the time.So i tried to change,stopped the flirty stuff and just acted normal and after three days she asked me what's wrong with me. She still looks at me differently than she looks at others, especially when there is noone around us,at work. When we are at her house its kinda...""normal"" ,we talk about guys, and how she is going on dates and stuff, so today she told me she got a boyfriend. I guess now I'm stuck,I'll have to meet him, listen about him and their relationship,act like a good friend all while im kinda in love with her. Im pretty grown up and there is no way i imagined all of this,i don't act like that toward any other woman at the moment and i figured she isn't either , there were some moments that made me kinda sure she likes me back. If you watched Stranger Things s5 when Will asked Robin how she knew Vicky likes her back, she told him exactly what happened to me- the shared looks,the signals, the snow ball that instead of turning into an avalanche like in Robin's case,melted in mine lol.  How on earth did I get this all wrong,i feel like i invested a lot of feelings for nothing in the past few months",1,1769291716.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

I don’t know why I’m bothering with this. Maybe it’s the whiskey. Maybe it’s the need to get some kind of outside perspective from people who won’t be able to tell my family how much of a psycho I’m turning out to be in my old age.



Maybe it’s both.



I run a small property out in the middle of nowhere. Not going to say where—just know it’s woodlands. I’m a craftsman. I sell pieces I make out of my shop. Nothing major. The usual things rich people who want to appear worldly and outdoorsy go for. Lights made from deer antlers—mostly sheds, but they don’t know that. Tables, lounges, cabinets made from odd pieces of wood.



The business was handed down to me from my uncle, who had enough connections with a few wealthier families to keep things moving. It used to be more of a side thing when I was younger, but… life happens.



I’m not rich by any means, but the property is paid for. A lot of my materials come from just walking the several acres my family owns. Fallen trees for “reclaimed” wood. Shed deer antlers are fairly common in the spring. Occasionally we get a group of coyotes wandering through, which means I end up with bone for knife handles and gun grips, along with some furs that sometimes sell well as wall hangers.



It’s not glamorous, but it keeps me supplied for my better-selling pieces and gives me something to feed the crayfish down by the creek.



I’m telling you all this to let you know that, well—



I’m not much of a people person.



I live alone. Family visits, sure, but since the divorce my kids don’t really have much to do with me. I’m not sure I really blame them. At least my son still takes my calls, even if he tries to get out of them.



So when I saw something like what I caught on my game camera footage two weeks ago…



Well, I don’t have many people to tell.



My brother, for instance, is too much of a drunken ass to really listen. He just thinks I’m going crazy like Mom did. But I’m not sitting here talking about angels trying to whisk me away.



It’s furry, whatever it is. My first thought was maybe a particularly large black bear, but that didn’t sit right. This thing moved pretty quick. I’ve seen black bears, and sure, they can run, but they’re used to being the biggest thing around this deep in the woods. They move slow—lazy even—unless food’s on the line.



Every time I caught a glimpse of this thing, it was moving quick and steady. Not stopping to sniff or investigate. Straight line.



Usually it was too far away to be in focus, or if I was lucky it’d show up right at the edge of a camera. I’d get a few seconds of black fur in frame directly below one, but never enough for a good look. Sure, it could’ve just been a really skittish black bear. Maybe it smelled me on the cameras.



But the way it moved always gave me the feeling of ""I’m going somewhere.""

That just isn’t right for an animal like that.



So my thoughts circled around to what else would be wandering around a big stretch of wilderness with nothing out there but the occasional buck and a stream not worth a damn for fishing.



Poachers, maybe. Or some druggies from town looking for a place to tent up for a while. Meth heads do that from time to time. Move out into the woods for whatever reason. After all, the shapes on the cameras were mostly just decent-sized black blobs. Could’ve been a coat, for all these old ten-megapixel cameras knew.



My routine was to check the footage once a week. The cameras mostly took pictures in bursts of five and would start overwriting older shots if you didn’t manually clear them out.



Usually I used them just to make sure nobody was doing anything too dumb out there—and for hunting, obviously. I’d never seen much worth talking about before.



After watching the footage, I figured I’d test the bear theory. That wasn’t hard to do. Black bears like an easy meal.



I still had offal from my last hunt that I hadn’t processed into fish bait yet. I let it thaw overnight, and the next day I tossed a few scraps out in plain sight of the cameras where I’d seen the thing pass by.



The week passed pretty quickly after that. I had an order for a classic armchair frame that needed some weirdly specific engravings done—by hand only. Weird, but nothing I couldn’t handle. I’ve had stranger requests that paid less, so I was happy to oblige.



Once I let the client know the chair was ready, I got myself set. Thermos loaded with coffee, it was finally time to do my rounds.



When I noticed the bait was gone, I felt a little smug. Figured I’d caught the dumb animal on camera. I swapped out the SD cards and took my time walking back home.



I wasn’t pleased with what I saw.



Coyotes. Lots of coyotes. Apparently the meat had attracted more of the pests. Or at least, that’s what should have attracted them.



Coyotes are annoying things. They eat just about anything, including each other.



But they’re not this stupid. They learn where people usually are and go around. Packs scrounge through my land or pass through it, but they don’t hang around. Every once in a while a few get brave and poke around, but I’m pretty quick about taking them down. Seeing more than a couple is odd—especially since I’d cleared a few out just last month.



And they certainly don’t travel close enough to my house to trip the cameras they did.



And the worst part?



That damn thing was still there. In the background. It looked like it was just strolling along a ridgeline while four or five coyotes stood around my camera, nipping at deer liver.



So I made up my mind. It wasn’t a smart decision, but it was the one I made.



I oiled up the family .30-06 and got ready for a classic coyote clean-out. I figured if anyone was hanging around, the sound of gunfire would “encourage” them to clear out. I wasn’t planning on keeping the pelts this time, and I didn’t feel like breaking out the .223 in case something was off with the “bear.”



I don’t need to think about it to know that was a dumb idea.



If it was meth heads, they’d probably just shoot me and be done with it. If it was a couple of local idiots, me just being there would’ve scared them off. It’s not like poachers around here were getting anything special—just regular old whitetail.



I should’ve told somebody. Left my kid a voicemail. Let someone in town know to maybe check on me in a couple of days.



But like I said, I’m not really a people person.



So I didn’t.



I checked the closest camera site first—the one that normally caught nothing but possums. Nothing left but coyote scat. Figured the pack was bedding down deeper in, so I kept walking.



Second site, more of the same.



It wasn’t until about two hours into my walk that I finally saw something odd at the third camera site.



A deer. Dead.



But not by coyotes. At least, I didn’t think so.



It was laid out with its back to me. Looked like it had taken a shot to the head, judging by the bloody spot on top of its skull.



Poachers, then. But why leave it? From behind it looked like a solid deer. Even out of season for antlers, that’s a lot of meat to walk away from.



As I got closer, I noticed the second wound.



It had been slit open—no, that wasn’t right. It had been cut. The cut was only maybe half a foot wide, just below the ribs, around lung height.



Weird place to start gutting.



That was when things started to click.



This wasn’t an old kill. Even if the coyotes hadn’t found it yet, something would’ve torn into it if it had been sitting overnight.



My chest tightened. I became very aware of the fact that I was a middle-aged guy alone in the woods with someone I didn’t know, leaving fresh kills on my property.



I glanced around, rifle low but finger twitching. I’d never thought I’d be getting into a firefight, and the idea had me staring wide-eyed at the tree line. Brush, low branches, hilly ground—plenty of places to hide.



I stepped back toward the deer and knelt, rifle still raised. I pressed my palm against its neck.



I’d never been so relieved to feel cool skin. Whoever did this might still be around, but at least I hadn’t walked up on someone mid-gut.



I looked back down at the incision, trying to guess what they could’ve been after. Lung height, maybe a little lower.



It wasn’t carved. Just a relatively clean cut, maybe pried open. I briefly considered a predator going for the wound, but there was no tearing, no hanging flesh to suggest a bite.



Standing back up took a second—my joints aren’t what they used to be—but movement in the distance gave me plenty of motivation.



Just beyond a hill, too far to see clearly but close enough to recognize.



A black, fuzzy shape. Striding with purpose.



Not a bear.



It was walking on two legs. Not too tall—maybe a little shorter than me—but big enough to be a person. I raised my rifle, started to line up a shot, and then it stepped into a thick stand of trees and vanished.



That’s where I should’ve stopped. Gone home. Called the wardens.



I’d found an out-of-season kill and seen some weirdo in a fur jacket trespassing. Every bit of sense I had was screaming to let the authorities handle it.



I don’t know why I followed them.



The thought that if I lost them they’d just leave and come back later wasn’t smart, but it was enough. I think part of me just wanted to see for myself the thing that had been sitting in the back of my mind for half a month.



I crept forward. Figured I’d lag behind, but if I kept a steady pace I might catch up when they stopped—or find a campsite and finally have this dealt with.



I don’t know how they moved the way they did. I never heard anything. No snapped branches. No crunch of leaves. That black blur moved like a ghost through my property.



No matter how far behind I thought I was, I always managed to pick them out. Sometimes just a speck at the edge of the trees. Other times close enough to make out the fuzzy outline—but never close enough to really see.



I guessed they were about five-three. They passed a fallen stump that came up to my chin, and they matched it almost exactly. 



It took me a while to realize they were walking from camera to camera, pausing just long enough for me to keep up without having to move too quickly.

It took a while longer to notice the carvings.

It was at the sixth camera when I finally saw it. The thing had lingered for a moment by the tree where the camera was strapped. I paused long enough to try swapping out the SD card, and that’s when I noticed a bare patch of bark not too far below the camera where a crude circle within a circle had been carved.

Maybe a marker. Still, why go through the trouble when an X would do?

I followed for another two hours. Past the last of my cameras. I’m pretty sure that after that, they walked me in a circle at least once before heading deeper into the woods—places I’d never bothered exploring. I was only barely sure we were still on my land. As far as I knew, nobody lived anywhere near where we’d wandered.

The black figure crested another thickly wooded hill. I still had no earthly idea how they’d managed it without stumbling or making a sound. I was moving at a painfully slow pace, trying to catch up quietly, while they moved like it was nothing. They didn’t even rustle the leaves.

Hands in the dirt, gripping at exposed roots. Crawling. No way I was going to do this without some kind of sound, but this was as quiet as it was going to get.

When I reached the top, hands covered in dirt and bits of dried leaves, I ignored the wet sensation under my right palm, mistaking it for mud. It only sank in when I put weight on it and felt something give, sending me flopping onto my side, my face landing on whatever had slid out from under me.

My first thought was scat. It took a lot not to come up cussing as I wiped what I was sure was digested possum off my face.



I stopped when I saw my hand coming away red.



I stared at my open palm. A small speck of purple goo sat near the center, a red smear trailing down from my fingertips.



“What the hell?” I mouthed.



I shook my hand and looked down at what I’d slipped on. An off-color hunk of meat, tangled with dirt and twigs.



It almost looked like the bait I’d thrown out.



Like a liver.



Did the coyotes bring it up here? I’d never known them to bother carrying scraps, but—



A loud creak cut my thoughts off. I hadn’t realized how long I’d been moving in silence, but whatever made that sound might as well have been right next to my ear.



Thud.



Soft, but definite.



I was looking at a house. Or maybe a cabin was more accurate. A simple log structure, sitting where I was certain nothing should’ve been. Planter boxes under plain glass windows.



A light came on behind red curtains.



I stood there, staring, trying to make sense of it. This wasn’t just someone passing through. Whatever I’d been following had settled in.



At least, that’s what I thought at the time.



This is getting long, and I’m starting to pass out. The whiskey catches up to me faster than it used to, and I’m still exhausted from all of this.



I’ll post the rest soon, if anyone’s interested.

1qm05d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1qm05d6/advice_for_youngnew_filmmakers_when_approaching/,Advice for Young/New Filmmakers when Approaching Industry Professionals,"This one is a bit of a doozy, but I wanted to give some advice to young people (or new filmmakers of any age!) who are actively trying to break into the industry and seek advice from industry professionals.

  
Please don't just cold call crew and above the line professionals on Instagram, hitting them up for work like you're old buddies, and say you're an 'experienced director' on student films. Please, don't do that! 

  
I've had a friend of a friend reach out to my personal (read: private) Instagram, a year after I gave them some advice on how to break into the industry in the UK, which I gave via my professional film Instagram account.

They've learned absolutely nothing, and did not bother taking any of the advice. Which is completely fine, but that way they've approached me a second time is a bit much. Instead, they've messaged me asking for film work because 'I've heard you have some' and positioned themselves as a very experienced director...on student films. That was it. The whole message. 

First things first, if you're trying to reach someone, private social media is a no-go for most people, and especially if someone does have ways of reaching them publicly. My IMDB has my email, my website has my email and a contact form, and I have a public-facing Instagram showcasing my film work.

Second of all, be respectful of the time it takes people to read your messages. I encourage people to reach out and cold email, but I suggest that they do their research on the person first (find where they're based, what they've worked on, their role(s)) to make it personable, and to ask people for a coffee or a Zoom first - certainly not jump into asking for work off the bat. Ideally, you should take these chats as an opportunity to genuinely learn about people's journeys into the industry and the work they do - and ask for advice! I also recommend that you need to set expectations before reaching out that the answer could be a no, you could be ghosted, or you may just have a nice chat. That's it. Not every connection will lead to work right away, and maybe something will come up down the line, or maybe you'll just learn something from a nice chat! But that doesn't mean it's any less useful!

Thirdly, please don't say you're an experienced director/producer/1st AD/DOP/Editor if you haven't actually done these roles. By all means, list your student experience and unpaid roles on a friend's set as experience - but specify that it's student/unpaid experience! It's a massive red flag to read that because it shows a lack of knowledge and respect for the years of graft and training that go into HOD roles, and potentially a lack of interest in actually learning from the ground up. It's all about attitude. You need to pay your dues, and sometimes the things film school teaches is just plain wrong when you get into the industry, too, so be prepared for that.

The reason why I'm sharing this, is because the individual who has reached out sounds like a nice enough person, and I want to help them, but I instantly felt a disconnect from reading this message. Before reaching out to someone, ask yourself why they would want to help you. From my perspective, this person has not A. Asked anything about me or shown any interest in my work, B. Doesn't seem to realise that I no longer live in the UK and have moved to LA (so how I would give him work, as he requested, I don't know!), and C. Jumped straight to asking for work, instead of asking for advice or literally anything else.

Don't be that person! Just be respectful, do your research, and set your expectations low while you keep trying. You'd be surprised at how many people - much higher up than me - are willing to help new entrants and students because we remember being new and young, but people generally won't help people that do mass emails and aren't actually interested in the person they're reaching out to. 

Good luck on your journeys!

I realised that he’s very much aware of the turbulent 30 years of being married to my mother, and he is very aware of her instability, but due to his own trauma responses he was a very emotionally unavailable dad. When I went no contact, for a few weeks I was hopeful he understood why I decided to go no contact. But he proved to me yet again, that he will prioritise feeling comfortable with his wife, over me being safe with my mum. 

Today I received this text from him, as my brother is having a sit down conversation with them after months too. I was proud of my response, and my nervous system felt pretty stable - but I can’t help but now feel that hurt all over again. He was meant to protect me, but he’s not ever shown me that. I agreed to go for coffee when I am feeling better, but I know it’s going to hurt re-iterating my boundaries. The past 8 weeks have been incredibly hard, just a mix of dissociation, distraction and allowing myself to accept the love from my friends and other family who I’m grateful not to feel like I have to perform to be loved by. 

I’m not sure how to navigate the relationship with my dad. I miss him, but I know space is necessary. I have started therapy, and I have been on a healing journey of returning back to myself for quite a while now - but this has me stumped ☹️

# How to beat the new super tax (before and after it starts)



There are different ways to tackle the new super tax, but they all get you to the same place. Bethany Rae

With so much of the detail still to be decided, this week’s deadline for submissions on the draft legislation, which will impose headline tax rates of as much as 30 per cent on super balances greater than $3 million and 40 per cent on balances greater than $10 million, is a reminder that changes could still be coming. The SMSF Association, for one, says the new tax isn’t right yet, which we will get to later.

# Option 2 – Withdraw funds in the year you make a large capital gain

If you have a huge spike in the value of your super – say your SMSF had a private equity investment in Canva or SpaceX ([or in a fund that owned one of them, like Pengana](https://archive.md/o/TIIFX/https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5nu2t)) and so made a huge capital gain when they went public – you would probably be best served by taking that huge gain out of super in the same tax year you made it, Heffron says.

“If they leave it in super, it will end up impacting the Division 296 tax they would pay when they sell it. If, on the other hand, they sell it and cash it all out in the same year of the spike, they effectively avoid that.”

How does that work?

“Let’s say they had $3 million in super and then a massive spike took them up to $6 million or $7 million,” Heffron explains. “If they sell and take the money they made out before the end of the year, then the total super balance at the beginning and end of the year will be $3 million.

“So even though they’ll have had a really big capital gain in that year, they won’t necessarily pay a lot of tax on it. But if they leave it in until the following year, well then they’re going to get caught because now their total super balance at the start of the year is really high,” and so it’s going to be caught by Division 296 in that year.

To see exactly how much Division 296 you might save if you have a starting super balance of $7 million and make a capital gain of $1.5 million, Ishara Rupasinghe, executive director at Evans & Partners in Canberra, provides a handy table. It shows the difference between the tax you will be liable for if you sell an asset and withdraw the money from super, and if you sell an asset and leave it in super.

Rupasinghe estimates that you’ll save about $17,000 in Division 296 if you sell and withdraw in the same year, but cautions that her calculations do not factor in normal capital gains tax, which still has to be paid even in super and aside from Division 296.

She also notes that once the $1.5 million is out of super, it probably can’t be put back, and you will have to pay tax on the earnings it generates in future.

“It will need some modelling to determine if avoiding some Division 296 tax is worth permanently losing future tax savings on all future earnings from those funds,” Rupasinghe says.

Craig Brooke, the chief executive of life insurance mutual society KeyInvest, agrees that the strategy would work, given what we know so far, but says the government might impose measures such as quarterly reporting requirements that might curtail that plan before it starts.

The government has already[ imposed an “integrity measure”](https://archive.md/o/TIIFX/https://www.afr.com/politics/chalmers-releases-draft-legislation-for-new-superannuation-tax-20251219-p5noz8) to assess the higher of a member’s balance at the beginning or end of the financial year to try to detect any manipulation.

The SMSF Association’s submission on the Division 296 legislation notes that the integrity measure as it is currently written might even unfairly capture some people.

“Post 1 July 2027, an individual who has a temporary spike in their total super balance at the ‘wrong’ time (i.e. toward the end of the financial year) will potentially be penalised for that twice – the year in which the spike occurs and the following year,” the association says in its submission. “The proposed approach lacks equity and fairness.”

But as it stands, the sell and withdraw strategy in the year you have a large capital gain will work, Brooke says. You will still have to pay normal capital gains tax, but you will limit Division 296 liability.

# Option 3 – Stagger withdrawals over three years to limit Division 296

Now for the three-stage process, which requires three separate tax years to work (and has the same caveat that legislation may yet change).

If you have built up your assets in super over time, and you have a mixture of assets – some with substantial capital gains, others with smaller capital gains, and cash – as most mature SMSFs would – Heffron has the following advice.

“Take all your cash out in year one, sell assets with low capital gains in the second year, and then realise your big capital gains in the third year and take all your money out.”

This works because Division 296 is applied to the proportion of earnings over the thresholds.

To remove assets from super, you must sell them, triggering either a capital gain or loss. Cash doesn’t generate a capital gain, and so in year one it’s easy to remove it all. The result is a lower balance without generating lots of capital gain to be taxed as earnings under Division 296.

In year two, sell the assets with lower capital gains. These are probably the ones you’ve held for the least amount of time and so haven’t built up lots of gains. It’s a bit of a last-in, first-out scenario. The proportion of your earnings over the thresholds will be lower because your total super balance will be lower. The same applies in year three, when you realise your biggest capital gains, but will have the smallest super balance.

“You want to really stagger your capital gains so that they happen in years when you’ve got the least in super … leave realising capital gains until you have lowered your balance,” Heffron says.

To be clear, this strategy is only really available to people with SMSFs or in retail funds with individualised portfolios involving handpicked investments rather than in large industry funds such as AustralianSuper.

It might be best to leave realising capital gains in super until you have lowered your balance. Simon Letch

It’s also going to suit older retirees who are already contemplating removing money from super before they die so their kids are not liable for the “death tax” on inherited super. They might bring their plans forward.

Brooke says he’s convinced people will become more inclined to actively manage their super by making drawdowns over time that keep their balance under the threshold.

# How to prepare for Division 296 if retirement is years away

The above strategies all work for people already over the $3 million cap (or very close to it), but what about those who are still short of the first threshold – or who are still in the “accumulation” phase (the period when you are adding to super) and so can’t withdraw any money?

Until Division 296 came into play, topping up your super balance was a “no-brainer” for high net worth clients, says Kym Bailey, technical services manager at Melbourne-based wealth manager JBWere.

For high-net-worth investors with $2 million to $3 million in super, Bailey says it’s important to fully maximise strategies to reduce their marginal tax rates outside super.

They could do this through companies, trusts or products such as investment bonds, which have lower tax rates than the top marginal personal rates.

For clients who are potentially 10 years away from retirement, with say $2 million in super, Bailey says she would need to do the modelling on individual circumstances, but as a general rule, the introduction of the new tax means she would reconsider reflexively topping up super.

“Now we do the modelling to see whether or not it actually might be better for that investor to commit their capital elsewhere,” Bailey says.

Heffron’s previous modelling has shown that for many people the Division 296 tax bill will be quite modest, and that selling an asset and generating capital gains tax is a worse option [because it could cost a lot more](https://archive.md/o/TIIFX/https://www.afr.com/wealth/personal-finance/5-make-or-break-questions-for-people-with-3m-in-super-20250526-p5m2bq) than simply paying the Division 296 tax.

However, she agrees that for some people it may also make sense to sell assets in their super before they break through the thresholds.

“You’ve certainly got a strong incentive to sell assets before members get to $3 million. Because if you realise them after $3 million, you’ll end up paying Division 296 tax on some of the growth that you had way before you even got to $3 million.”

# Sometimes, the best strategy may be to do nothing

But there is a big caveat to that because Division 296 is progressive – it gets more onerous as your balance increases. As mentioned above, the tax you will have to pay if you are just over the $3 million mark is not too high.

“Not many people go from $2.9 million to $10 million. They go from $2.9 million to $3.3 million and if you sell things when your balance is $3.3 million, the proportion of your balance that’s over $3 million is so small that while you might have a big capital gain, not much of it will be subject to Division 296 tax,” says Heffron.

So for many people in the $2 million bracket, it might just be best to do nothing.

“If you’ve got $2 million and you expect you’ll probably go over $3 million one day, but not by much, then I don’t think you’d do anything differently. You’d just be slightly annoyed when you end up having to pay a little bit more tax in the future,” she says.

Brooke, however, says that many people in the top tax rate who have super balances in this range should consider limiting their annual input to the $30,000 concessional contributions cap – the maximum amount of pre-tax money you can put in any year without paying any additional tax.

Which brings us back to the important point that Division 296 is payable only when you have actually made a profit, and you won’t pay it unless you already have a lot [more in super than almost everyone else](https://archive.md/o/TIIFX/https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5nqni).

# How to beat the new super tax (before and after it starts)

With the new super tax slated to start in less than six months, we asked the experts for the strategies you can put in place now to limit potential liability.

There are different ways to tackle the new super tax, but they all get you to the same place. Bethany Rae

The complexity of the proposed new tax on high superannuation balances has accountants, financial advisers and tax agents scrambling to figure out how their clients will be affected – and how to minimise the impact.

With so much of the detail still to be decided, this week’s deadline for submissions on the draft legislation, which will impose headline tax rates of as much as 30 per cent on super balances greater than $3 million and 40 per cent on balances greater than $10 million, is a reminder that changes could still be coming. The SMSF Association, for one, says the new tax isn’t right yet, which we will get to later.

But based on what we know so far, there are three clear ways to reduce the impact of the tax,[ known as Division 296](https://archive.md/o/TIIFX/https://www.afr.com/wealth/personal-finance/5-details-to-watch-out-for-in-the-new-division-296-tax-legislation-20251105-p5n7u4). The first two are quick and work best if you are facing a big, one-off capital gain.

The other takes three years and works best for super balances that have been built up over time, and have a mix of assets with varying levels of capital gains.

It’s important to note that all three strategies will work only if you are legally allowed to withdraw money from super, meaning you need to meet a so-called condition of release – for most people, that is retirement after 60 years of age.

For people with large balances and some way off from retirement, the options are more limited. We will explain why a bit later.

# Option 1 – Reduce your super balance before Division 296 starts (by June 2027)

If you are retired, or retiring before June 30, 2027, and you want to make sure your balance is below the $3 million and $10 million thresholds, you have a year’s grace to sell up and switch your money out of super, says Meg Heffron, one of Australia’s top technical experts on SMSFs.

“If people want to take money out to avoid the tax, in the first year, that’s easy enough. You just get it out before the end of the first year,” Heffron says.

“But for people who might want to do that in the future, there’s going to be some really good strategic opportunities to do so cleverly. For some people, they will want to do it quickly, but for others, they will want to do it slowly.”

# Option 2 – Withdraw funds in the year you make a large capital gain

If you have a huge spike in the value of your super – say your SMSF had a private equity investment in Canva or SpaceX ([or in a fund that owned one of them, like Pengana](https://archive.md/o/TIIFX/https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5nu2t)) and so made a huge capital gain when they went public – you would probably be best served by taking that huge gain out of super in the same tax year you made it, Heffron says.

“If they leave it in super, it will end up impacting the Division 296 tax they would pay when they sell it. If, on the other hand, they sell it and cash it all out in the same year of the spike, they effectively avoid that.”

How does that work?

“Let’s say they had $3 million in super and then a massive spike took them up to $6 million or $7 million,” Heffron explains. “If they sell and take the money they made out before the end of the year, then the total super balance at the beginning and end of the year will be $3 million.

Ishara Rupasinghe says you can save some tax but it can become complicated when you move assets out of super. 

“So even though they’ll have had a really big capital gain in that year, they won’t necessarily pay a lot of tax on it. But if they leave it in until the following year, well then they’re going to get caught because now their total super balance at the start of the year is really high,” and so it’s going to be caught by Division 296 in that year.

To see exactly how much Division 296 you might save if you have a starting super balance of $7 million and make a capital gain of $1.5 million, Ishara Rupasinghe, executive director at Evans & Partners in Canberra, provides a handy table. It shows the difference between the tax you will be liable for if you sell an asset and withdraw the money from super, and if you sell an asset and leave it in super.

Rupasinghe estimates that you’ll save about $17,000 in Division 296 if you sell and withdraw in the same year, but cautions that her calculations do not factor in normal capital gains tax, which still has to be paid even in super and aside from Division 296.

She also notes that once the $1.5 million is out of super, it probably can’t be put back, and you will have to pay tax on the earnings it generates in future.

“It will need some modelling to determine if avoiding some Division 296 tax is worth permanently losing future tax savings on all future earnings from those funds,” Rupasinghe says.

I’ve noticed a growing new demand on job market lately for AI video creators. Whether it's for startups needing high-end marketing, indie filmmakers, or even big studios, the industry is shifting toward AI-native production pipelines. Some of these specialized roles are already starting to pay pretty crazy amounts because so few people actually know how to control these models yet.

I’m personally obsessed with the creative side of this, but it’s a bit of a lonely grind. I’m looking to make some friends who are either:

1. **Already making AI videos** (as a career, a side hustle, or just a hobby).
2. **Familiar with workflows** (shoutout to my ComfyUI / MulanAI warriors).
3. **Curious about the craft** but don’t know where to start.

For those who haven't seen this type of role yet - AI video creation isn't just ""clicking a button."" It’s basically the next generation of cinematography. We’re using models like Kling, Luma, Runway, and Sora to create visuals that used to require a $100k budget.

What does it take? It’s a mix of:

* **Creative Direction**: Knowing how to pace a scene and tell a story.
* **Prompt Engineering**: Learning the ""language"" of the models to get exactly the right lighting/camera movement.
* **Technical Workflow**: Setting up complex pipelines in tools like ComfyUI to get consistent characters and high-res results.

If there are enough of us at Cal who are hyped about this, I’d love to **start a club or a casual weekly meetup.** We could share workflows, collab on projects, and keep up with the tech (since it literally changes every three days).

here's what i found that actually works. no recycled ""just be confident bro"" bullshit. these are actionable insights from actual experts who study this stuff for a living.

**1. your voice matters way more than you think**

Dr. David Puts at Penn State found that men with lower voices are rated as more attractive, more dominant, and more likely to be chosen as leaders. women's voices that are slightly higher (but not cartoonishly so) are rated as more attractive too.

you can literally train this. start humming from your chest instead of your throat. speak slower. pause more. i started doing vocal exercises from a book called ""[Set Your Voice Free](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316441589)"" by Roger Love (he's trained celebrities like John Mayer and Reese Witherspoon for decades). the techniques are simple but wildly effective. this book completely changed how i think about communication. best $15 i ever spent on self improvement.

**2. smell is criminally underrated**

there's actual science behind pheromones and attraction. Dr. Rachel Herz at Brown found that scent is the sense most closely tied to memory and emotion.

but here's the kicker. it's not just about cologne. your diet affects how you smell. eat more fruits and vegetables, cut back on processed crap. one study in Evolution and Human Behavior showed women rated men who ate more produce as having more pleasant body odor.

also. shower before bed, not just in the morning. your pillow absorbs oils and bacteria that transfer back to your skin and hair.

**3. the proximity effect is real as hell**

Dr. Robert Zajonc's research on the ""mere exposure effect"" showed that people develop preferences for things simply because they're familiar with them.

translation? show up consistently in someone's life. same gym time, same coffee shop, same friend group gatherings. familiarity breeds attraction way more than that ""mysterious stranger"" nonsense rom coms sold us.

**4. micro expressions reveal everything**

Paul Ekman's research on facial expressions (yeah, the guy from Lie to Me) found that genuine smiles activate different muscles than fake ones. the orbicularis oculi muscle around your eyes only contracts during real happiness.

people subconsciously pick up on this. so if you're forcing smiles constantly, you're actually making yourself less attractive. instead, find things that genuinely amuse you. laugh more. the app ""[Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748)"" helped me build a habit of noticing small positive moments throughout the day, which made authentic positive expressions way more natural.

**5. body language beats looks**

Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard showed that expansive postures (taking up space) increase testosterone and decrease cortisol. aka you literally feel more confident.

but here's what nobody mentions. contractive postures (hunching, crossing arms, looking at your phone constantly) do the opposite. they make you feel AND look less attractive.

Dr. Monica Moore studied flirting behaviors and found that people who made themselves more ""available"" through open body language got approached way more than conventionally attractive people with closed off postures.

**6. conversational reciprocity is the secret weapon**

Harvard researchers found that asking questions during conversations activates reward centers in the other person's brain. but not interview style questions. reciprocal self disclosure.

you share something slightly vulnerable, they share back, you go slightly deeper, they follow. it creates intimacy fast.

the book ""[We Need to Talk](https://www.amazon.com/We-Need-Talk-Conversations-Matter/dp/0062669001/)"" by Celeste Headlee breaks down conversation skills better than anything i've read. she's an NPR host who's interviewed thousands of people. insanely good read. her tips on active listening made me realize how badly i sucked at conversations before.

**7. competence is attractive across the board**

Dr. Geoffrey Miller's work on sexual selection found that displays of skill, creativity, and intelligence are universally attractive traits.

this means getting genuinely good at something. anything. woodworking, cooking, rock climbing, coding, writing, photography. mastery signals conscientiousness, discipline, and intelligence.

people are drawn to passion. when you talk about something you're actually skilled at, your entire demeanor changes. you become magnetic.

**8. social proof compounds attractiveness**

Dr. Benedict Jones found that people rated faces as more attractive when they saw others rating them highly first.

this is why having a solid friend group matters so much. when people see you're valued by others, they automatically perceive you as more valuable.

join communities. contribute to group projects. be the person who organizes hangouts. social proof builds itself once you start.

**9. the contrast principle works both ways**

behavioral economists found that people judge things relative to what came before. if you're always available, always agreeable, always there, your value perception drops.

have your own life. cancel plans occasionally (politely). don't respond instantly to every text. this isn't game playing manipulation, it's genuine busy ness from pursuing your goals.

dr. robert cialdini covers this extensively in ""[influence: the psychology of persuasion""](https://www.amazon.com/Influence-New-Expanded-Psychology-Persuasion/dp/B08RLT11Q3/). it's required reading for understanding human behavior. this book will make you question everything you think you know about social dynamics.

**10. stress kills attractiveness**

chronic stress elevates cortisol which worsens skin, causes weight gain, disrupts sleep, and literally changes facial structure over time.

dr. sara gottfried's work on hormones shows how stress management directly impacts physical appearance. meditation, exercise, proper sleep. not optional if you want to look your best.

i started using insight timer for 10 minute daily meditations. the app has thousands of free guided sessions. reduced my baseline anxiety significantly within weeks.

if you want a more structured approach to all this, there's an AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from relationship psychology books, dating research, and expert insights to create personalized learning plans. built by a team from Columbia and Google, it generates custom podcasts based on your specific goals, like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" or ""master conversation skills for dating."" you can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and choose different voice styles. it also builds an adaptive plan that evolves as you learn, which makes working on attraction skills way less overwhelming and more systematic.

look. genetics matter. but they're not destiny. most attraction is behavioral, environmental, and trainable. the science backs this up hard.

you're not stuck with your current level of attractiveness. you can systematically improve it by understanding what actually drives human attraction and working on those specific areas.

these aren't hacks. they're long term investments in becoming genuinely more attractive as a person. which beats any shortcut.",1,1769290661.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

1qlzq10,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qlzq10/struggling_with_perspective_after_break_up/,Struggling with perspective after break up,"About a year and a half ago, I (late twenties) turned a more than a decade long friendship into a relationship which also happened to be my first real relationship in general. That relationship ended in early January when my beloved (I don't want to give numbers but she's a bit older than me) broke up with me over, as I now understand it, my inability to communicate with her, share my innermost thoughts/problems and lay out plans for our future - something that unsettled her immensely since she also has a daughter from a previous relationship to care about. I understand and empathize with her reasoning perfectly well and even though I mourn the fact that she couldn't tell me about these concerns until most of the damage was already done, I fully acknowledge my irresponsible behaviour, inaction and reticence which I know are at least in part rooted in untreated mental health issues that have nothing to do with her.

Shortly after the break up we agreed to only communicate on an ""update"" basis, meaning that I mostly informed her about what was going on in my life right now, as the shock from the break up - for the first time in years - gave me somewhat of a boost to pursue important things I've avoided doing (career, driver's license, reaching out to counseling, sports, quitting alcohol and coffee). This quickly changed as unresolved questions about where we stand emotionally and where that leaves our long friendship started popping up in my head and we started talking regularly about these things. As I understand now, this was mostly a haphazard way of me trying to establish if there's any hope for us to be together in the future since our initial conversation left me with some painful ambiguity but she was fine with this since she didn't want to avoid contact to begin with given our long shared history. She would initially respond by saying something along the lines of ""I can't see the future"" in response to my inquiries, or say things like ""It would be sweet if we managed to make it work some day"". As time went on, she started sounding more overtly negative, telling me that she still loves me but her gut instinct says it's unlikely I will be able to rebuild her trust in me and that I should let go of the relationship to focus on myself instead. She also said that she felt better after the break up because she didn't have to suffer from the uncertainty anymore.

We talked casually a while after and started spending more time on the phone together and whenever we did talk about our relationship she would speak in a very cold, analytic manner unless I involuntarily said or did something that triggered emotions from the late phase of our relationship. This and the fact that we were spinning in circles caused her to say that she doesn't think these conversations are getting us anywhere useful. The next day after I told her that I got a job interview, she said that she's sad about the fact that she won't be part of the personal growth I'm now experiencing and that she wished our relationship rather than the break up would have been what prompted it. This segued into another conversation where I told her that I can't deal with these sorts of messages because they prevent me from getting over the break up and I admitted that I've been suffering from sleep issues and intense states of anxiety ever since we had started spending more time together again. At a later point she told me that ""nobody cares what you feel (you meaning one, not me in particular)"" which I realise came from her own place of hurt but still felt dismissive of my emotional state. I then brought up the idea of pausing contact because I felt that my current attachment and possessive feelings towards her would otherwise poison what's left of our friendship. She wasn't happy about it but could see how it would help me let go.

So that's where I'm at right now. I'm not really sure whether I'm doing the right thing here. I still feel a lot of guilt over how I ruined this relationship and betrayed her trust in me and I'm not sure whether putting our friendship on hold to focus on myself is really the correct response. On some level it just feels like running away and not honoring the friendship we used to have and I can't see how this will help me rebuild trust. As of now, the lack of contact isn't really helping me detach from the situation and she occupies just as much space in my day to day thoughts (if not more).

1qlzlry,https://www.reddit.com/r/TurkishCoffee/comments/1qlzlry/a_practical_technical_guide_to_turkish_coffee/,A Practical & Technical Guide to Turkish Coffee Grinders (Community Reference),"​Let’s clear up the biggest misconception in our hobby: ""If a grinder can do Espresso, it can do Turkish.""

​Most of the time, this is false.
​Turkish coffee grinding is a torture test for equipment. We are aiming for a 40–220 micron range—finer than espresso, almost like flour, but (and this is key) not completely uniform. We need a specific amount of ""fines"" (micro-dust) to create that traditional foam and heavy body, but we still need precision to avoid a muddy, bitter mess.

​This isn't a ""buying guide"" sponsored by brands. This is a technical reality check on what actually survives the job based on community experience.

​MANUAL GRINDERS (The Recommended Path)

​For Turkish coffee, manual is usually king. You get superior burrs for your money, zero motor heat to burn the grounds, and precise micro-adjustments.

 - ​1Zpresso J-Ultra (The Precision King)

Currently the easiest recommendation for serious brewers. The 8-micron adjustment steps are insane—you can practically dial in your flavor by the second. It eats through beans surprisingly fast for how fine it grinds. If you want total control, this is it.

 - ​Molent G50 / Pocket (The Native Specialist)

We have to mention Molent. Designed by a Turkish engineer specifically for this brew method, these grinders are aggressive. They cut through hard beans at fine settings without the ""stalling"" you get on generic grinders. The build quality punches way above its price point. It’s basically built to do one thing perfectly.

 - ​Pietro (Flat Burrs Manual? Yes.)

This is weird, cool, and effective. It uses vertical 58mm flat burrs. Important: You need the ""M-Modal"" (Multipurpose) burrs for this to work. It produces a flavor profile that conical burrs just can't match—super clear but still has that heavy body we love. It’s bulky, but the taste is top-tier.

 - ​Kingrinder K6 (Best Value)

If you don't want to spend $200+, this is the one. It’s significantly faster than the Comandante and capable of true Turkish fineness. It’s the ""people's champion"" of grinders right now due to the price-to-performance ratio.

 - ​Comandante C40 (Only with Red Clix)

A classic, but here is the reality: The stock axle is too coarse for precise dialing. You must buy the Red Clix upgrade to get the precision needed for Turkish. It produces a very clean cup, but be warned—it is slow at this setting. You will get a forearm workout.

 - ​Timemore C3 ESP (Budget Entry)

Make sure it is the ""ESP"" version. The standard C2/C3 adjustment plates are too wide. The ESP works if you are on a strict budget, but don't expect the speed or consistency of the K6 or Molent.

 - ​Traditional Brass Mills (Sözen, etc.)

Look, we all love the nostalgia. But technically? They suffer from shaft wobble (inconsistent particle size), they are hard to clean, and over time they can impart a metallic taste. They produce a lot of fines—if you want that super-muddy, old-school texture, this is how you get it. But for clarity? Modern grinders win.

ELECTRIC GRINDERS (Proceed with Caution)

​Grinding this fine generates massive friction. Most electric grinders will either clog, overheat, or burn out their motors.

 - ​Mazzer Philos / Niche Zero

These are the outliers. The Niche Zero has the torque to handle this without complaining. The Mazzer Philos is one of the few modern flat-burr grinders tested to handle the sub-espresso range comfortably without stalling.

 - ​Eureka Mignon Series

Exceptions: The specific ""Mignon Turk"" model works fine.

The Risk: For standard Mignons (Specialita, etc.), the adjustment dial is tiny. Switching from Filter -> Turkish and back is a nightmare; you will lose your zero point. Also, they are prone to clogging at this fineness.

 - ​Baratza Encore ESP / Fellow Opus

Great for espresso, but risky here. The plastic gears in the Opus and the motor torque in the Encore aren't really built for the daily abuse of Turkish grinding (powder fine). You might get away with it occasionally, but don't make it your daily driver.

 - ​Critical Technical Tips for Survival

​RDT is Mandatory: If you use an electric grinder, you must use the Ross Droplet Technique (a tiny drop of water on the beans). Turkish grounds are incredibly static-prone and sticky. Without water, your grinder becomes a clogged mess.

​Use Bellows: Even ""zero retention"" grinders will hold onto Turkish grounds. Use a bellows (puffer) to clear the chamber.

​Watch the Heat: Never grind more than 2-3 doses back-to-back on a home electric grinder. The friction heat will cook the coffee before you even brew it.

She was giving me advice, but also laughing with me and talking about how we both work two jobs and other stuff. We basically talked for like 30 mins.

After I had to go to a meeting, I returned a couple of hours later and struck up another conversation with her. We spoke for another 15–20 minutes. Out of nowhere, she asked me if I had Instagram. I pulled out my phone, and she searched for her profile. She told me she made a new account just to be more private and got tired of all the fakeness on the platform. I sent her a follow and am just waiting for her to accept the request.

I’m wondering if I should take this as a sign to message her and talk with her on there and eventually ask her for coffee after she accepts the request. Am I misreading this signal? Am I crazy? I don’t know, but I do feel some chemistry between us.",1,1769290004.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Once you get into a new routine, the days seem to roll by like clockwork. Not that any of those days lacked for excitement. Ward kept us busy with new assignments each day. Noah kept us aware and alert as we traversed every tree and dark corner. 

We had some varied missions as the weeks rolled by. Some went back to the forest, others took us through suburban cul-de-sacs and into the darker alleys of the citie's back lots. 

Our covers were just as interesting. One day we were city inspectors checking on new construction downtown. Another day we were back to being park rangers, hunting down a rumor of a chupacabra. We knew what it was. 

My favorite one, we were disguised as plumbers. A hotel had lost water supply to their ground floor pool and it stopped circulating. Took some diagnosing, turned out an eel-like creature had lodged itself into the filtration system. We had to cut the pipe to remove it, and when it wriggled free of its confinement, Chris was startled backwards when it slithered out after him and he fell into the pool. I hadn't laughed that hard in a while. 

Sam and I handeled the investigations. Several times we followed some obscure trail to the end of the line, scraps left for evidence, only to find the subtle leftover trace of where the veil closed and our person had vanished. Those felt all too familiar, but at least now there was a final preventative measure to seal away the gap. 

One occasion we managed to get to someone in time, a woman out for a jog happened to pass by where an Event tossed out another creature. That time we had to play the part of Animal Control. Me and Chris spun the distraught woman a tale about a rabies infected dog that we had to put down for public safety. I think she will still be signing up for therapy at some point. 

I wasn't sure about the other team's progress, but I felt like we were doing some good work. We brought back tons of data on the breaches, completed our runs early and we kicked back and enjoyed the rest from our hard work just as much. All in all, I was enjoying myself again. 

Still, there were some things that weren't quite on the level for me. 

According to Noah, the openings from the Veil were starting to misbehave. When we would close them, it took a bit longer than expected. Maybe just a few seconds, but some took more effort than others. As if there was more pressure from the other side. Noah would make his recordings and file them but Ward never seemed too concerned about those details. Just affirmed a job well done. 

Declan made a comment the other day about having requested new parts and materials and not all of the orders showed up. It wouldn't be much, smaller items like screws, wire spools and a single stabilizer unit missing. He figured one of the teams was snagging them, although none confessed. 

Come to think of it, Ward never really showed much emotion one way or the other about the situation. Whatever military branch he came from must have hardened him like stone, never wavering in his demeanor. Just acknowledged our reports, passed on the data where it needed to go, and set us up with our next assignments when it was time. I have to say, he was very efficient as Chief of Operations. 

The Director, however, seemed a little more tired each day. Apparently our little township was struggling a bit more to resolve than other places they've worked. New readings kept flowing in, new missions to pin to the board. More investigations meant more paperwork.  

The other teams must have felt the pressure too. Someone finally snapped. 

I came in to the office one day, just me and Noah. Sam and Chris were handling a run on their own. We only had two openings to inspect that day and they offered to go while we stayed and took care of some busy work for Declan. I walked in, coffee in hand with Noah in tow, to find someone shouting, then they tossed something in Declan's direction. 

""Your tech is broken, Rourke. We had to fire three charges into a fissure before it would even budge."" The man shouted, stepping up to Declan and poking a finger at him. 

""Two of those things came out after us, and almost got Jack."" 

Declan didn't back down. 

""I told you before, you need to calibrate the stabilizers first, otherwise the charges are not as effective."" 

""Oh, so its my fault we almost got our faces eaten off!?"" 

Declan snickered ""In your case, it might be an improvement."" 

He lunged at Declan, and the two men struggled for a moment. I quickly set my coffee down and got between them, pushing the man away from Declan. 

""Alright that's enough. Whatever this is, this isn't how to handle it."" 

The man squared up to me now. He was slightly taller than me, dark hair greased back over his ears. Mustache that combed over his top lip. Aviator glasses that had just enough tint to block out the sun. 

He was dressed as you might imagine, in jeans, a dark polo shirt, and a solid colored military style jacket with pockets across the chest and a raised collar with a zipper down the middle. I got the sense he was the more ""modern"" version of me. Albeit with an 80's kind-of style. 

I met his gaze behind the tinted lenses, staring back under the brim of my hat. 

""If you got a problem, we can talk it out, man to man."" I said 

He smiled a toothy grin ""Big bad wolf to the rescue. Tell me, did you buy that detective outfit in a costume store?"" 

""Same place you found that mustache and glasses."" 

""Oh. He's got jokes."" He snapped back ""Why don't you head on back to whatever newspaper comic you fell out of and let the real detectives do their work."" 

I smiled ""Because guys like you need guys like me to pick up all the slack you leave behind."" 

He scoffed ""Uh huh. Tell you what, you stick to your side, stay outta my way, and we won't have any issues."" 

""Sure thing, slick,"" I took a step closer, ""But you come at my people, and your mustache doesn't make it past 'Go'. Clear?"" 

He looked at me for a moment, then turned around and walked back towards the open side door and out of the building. 

People like that irritate me. No respect. 

I turned back to Noah and Declan ""So, who was that wanna-be?"" 

""Richard Payne,"" Noah said 

""Dick,"" Declan corrected ""He was a homicide detective in Florida."" 

Noah Continued, ""He's always been a jerk. I still don't know why they recruited him."" 

""He's certainly a pain. What was he going on about?"" I asked Declan. 

Declan looked between me and Noah, quietly like someone else might be listening. ""Come with me over to the garage."" 

We headed out the same side bay and across to one of the smaller buildings. The roller door was up, revealing a workshop inside. All the equipment and tool cabinets were on rollers, making it easy to pack things up if they needed to adjust the space or clear out quickly. 

He had all manner of power equipment and hand tools, and each area was roughly organized for different operations or equipment he was working on. Lathes, a drill press, and machining tools were grouped off to one side. Hand tools, material storage bins, and an electronics work station were on the other side. In the middle was a desk pushed flush against the wall alongside a flat workbench and an old sofa. 

Noah sat down in a high stool by Declan's desk, spinning around once and back to us, resting his arm on the surface. Declan picked a screwdriver off the workbench to fidget between his fingers. 

""Firstly, that guy is an imbecile."" He said pointing it out the door, ""I've told him three times to calibrate the stabilizers on each run. They have to sync to the anomaly to stabilize it properly."" 

Noah nodded along muttering ""Mmhmm."" 

""But also,"" he scratched his head, ""there are some weird things happening lately."" 

""Is there anything wrong with the gear?"" Noah asked plainly. 

""No, I don't think so. Im not the only engineer ANCR has, but I've been working on this tech for a while now and it does what it's supposed to. If you use it properly, that is."" 

I took a breath ""Why does it work at all? What is the Veil supposed to be anyways?"" 

Declan thought for a moment. 

""We don't know exactly,"" he chuckled, ""I have a friend who has a theory."" 

""Oh yeah?"" 

""He worked at the VLA in New Mexico, listening to the stars for signals. He tells me one day, they picked up a reading far out there that matches the exact frequency we track from the Veil. Said the signal emanates, faintly but clear, out of a black hole."" 

Noah and I exchanged shocked expressions 

""What?"" I blurted out 

""For real? So It's aliens?"" Noah said, wide eyed like he had just won a prize. 

Declan laughed heartily ""Ah, you should see your faces. No, it's not aliens. At least, none that say 'Hi' back."" He paused ""That is true though, about the signal... Still, we have no idea what or where the Veil is."" 

""It has to be some kind of door, how else are things getting through?"" I said 

""It's sort of like a door,"" he mused, ""yet more like a window with a curtain."" 

He paused for a moment 

""You both know about Nikola Tesla, right?"" 

We nodded. 

Declan leaned back against the bench, arms mid-gesture and eyes forward like he was readying to tell a great story. 

“Back at the turn of the twentieth century,” he began, “Nikola Tesla was obsessed with energy. Not electricity in the way Edison thought of it, all wires and lights, but frequency. How energy moves through space itself.” 

Noah nodded. “Wireless before it was cool.” 

“Before it was safe,” Declan added. “Tesla believed the Earth behaved like a massive conductor. He did all kinds of experiments where he would channel electricity in different ways, absorbing it and sending it out miles away.” 

“So he thought of the planet like a lightning rod?"" I asked. 

Declan pointed at me. “Exactly. Only in reverse.” 

He exhaled through his nose. “Wardenclyffe Tower was supposed to prove it. True wireless power. Global communication. Free energy sent to anywhere on the planet.” 

Noah swiveled in his chair. “But, it didn't work?"" 

""No... Not the way he wanted."" He said. 

""He was at his wits end trying to make it work. The tower needed more power, but it was operational. The investors backed out. He was livid, but determined to make it work. That night, in a blind fury, he turned it on. Maxed out every generator in the tower to critical. And then..."" 

He clapped his hands together 

""It fired a pulse of energy so powerful that it split the sky."" 

  

Noah was hanging on the edge of his seat. So was I. 

“Tesla didn’t just hit the Earth’s natural frequency,” he said. “He rung it like a bell."" 

He tapped the edge of metal bowl with his screwdriver, making it sing for emphasis. 

""Loud enough that whatever boundary separates… well, here from there, it cracked.” 

I felt a chill creep up my spine. “You’re saying he tore a hole in reality?” 

Declan shook his head slowly. “No. It was more like he cracked the window.” 

“The experiment shut down before it could stabilize. Equipment, now broken, was dismantled. Tesla died thinking he failed.” 

Noah spoke quietly. “But the crack didn’t go away.” 

Declan nodded. “It held. Weak at first. Decades passed. Technology advanced. Now there's radios, radar, satellites. Each one nudged the same harmonics again and again.” 

""That's when the cracks started getting bigger."" I continued his thought. 

He looked at me then. “Yes. Anyone and anything close enough could accidently slip through without warning. People, and cars. Planes disappeared mid flight. Ships would vanish, and sometimes reappear, damaged and abandoned."" 

""What about the creatures?"" I asked 

Declan's jaw tightened, ""Thats a new thing, they say. Over the last few years, the breaches started, a few were big ones."" He nodded towards Noah, ""But the number is increasing. Thats where we are now."" 

We sat for a moment staring at the floor. 

Finally, Noah spoke. “Then why is it getting worse?” 

He looked between us. 

“We close the Veil every time we find an opening. Why isn’t that enough?” 

Declan thought for a moment. 

""It should be. We've always been able to repair the cracks, nice and neat, but it feels different now. Besides, we don't really know what it's like on the other side."" 

""Did anybody ever try to look?"" I asked. 

Noah turned to me, ""Yeah, they did a few times. I sent my own drone in there but the footage is always scrambled, even with a direct connection. Besides..."" he exhaled, ""you saw what happened to the monsters. Same thing probably happens to people."" 

""No one has ever survived going to the other side."" Declan confirmed. 

He snapped his fingers ""Maybe... the tech works, but maybe the method is off."" He started pacing, ""What if we're just throwing stones in the pond, trying to stop the waves, but instead the waves just amplify. You end up with bigger waves. More frequency."" 

""And now,"" I continued, ""the waves are starting to swamp the boat."" 

He nodded, but before he could say more, we heard the sound of screeching tires and brakes locking up. We ran out to see the old Forestry truck was back. Chris was leaning halfway in the passenger side, then he pulled out Sam in his arms. She had a tourniquet tied around her left shoulder, her lower arm covered in blood. 

""Get the medic, now!"" He shouted. 

She was quickly taken from his arms to a stretcher and wheeled into the adjacent building, which housed a makeshift field hospital. 

""What happened, Chris?"" I asked as he approached us. 

He had this flustered appearance, like he had run a marathon, but his eyes were steady. 

""We were able to get the first Tear closed, but the second... Just a moment after it collapsed, it tore open again. A big one came through, all teeth, spikes and some sort of bone plating. It got ahold of Sam's arm and slung her to the ground. Took all the ammo I had to bring it down."" 

I put a hand on his shoulder, ""You got her back safe. You did good."" 

He shook his head slowly, ""I was late. These things are getting worse, Derrick. I don't know whats going on."" 

""We were just talking about that."" Noah piped up. 

""Why don't you come in here and take a seat,"" Declan offered, ""I'll fetch you somethin' to drink while you take a break."" 

We waited for hours. Every minute felt like an eternity. Finally the surgeon came around to see us. 

""She's gonna be okay,"" She said, ""Above the elbow was lacerated and torn severely. Unfortunately we had to amputate, but we have her mended now. You can see her, but go easy. She is still groggy and will need her rest."" 

""Thanks Doc."" I replied. 

he guys left it up to me to check on her. Said it would feel more professional from me, one ex-officer to another, but I admit I was worried about her. 

The setup was clean for being put together in an old storage building. A full operating room in the back with a sterile environment screen and filtering, and multiple beds with separate curtains off to the side. 

Sam had the middle one. Ward was already there at the foot of her bed, standing straight, arms folded behind his back as usual. He nodded as I stepped beside him. 

She lay there under the sheets, connected to several wires and IVs. An oxygen tube hooked into her nose. Her left shoulder was wrapped up in a blanket of gauze. 

I stood beside him, reading his posture for a moment, then turning to Sam. Ward finally let his mask slip a little. Through his professional demeanor I could tell he was uncomfortable. 

""She's being transfered to West Lake Medical,"" he stated, "" It's a days drive from here, but they have a good trauma wing. She's out of this fight now."" 

We stood in silence for a moment, listening to the sound of beeping and whirring from the machines. Sam breathed slowly and steadily, eyes closed. 

""She's fortunate,"" he finally said ""Owens' field tourniquet prevented major blood loss."" 

He turned to me ""He did good, Wolfe. Got the situation handeled, and got her out quick."" 

I thought to pass on his compliments to Chris, though I doubted he would agree with the praise. 

He turned back to her, ""We will get this under control soon enough, seal up the cracks for good."" 

His phone started ringing. 

""I need to take this,"" he said, frowning at his smart watch, ""rest up, we'll talk later."" He said, regarding Sam and nodded to me before stepping out.

I stepped up beside her now, my hands clasped together in front of me. Her eyes fluttered open slowly and she looked around. 

""Hey... it's me,"" I said, ""the guys wanted to check in on you."" 

She cracked a smile, I grinned back, ""You look like you could use a drink. Too bad I forgot to bring my stool."" I teased 

She laughed weakly then winced at the pain. I gave her an apologetic smile for my dry humor. 

""He's got a point, you know."" She said weakly. 

""About?"" 

""Getting a handle on things."" She said looking up to me. 

I leaned in closer with my hands rested onto the side rail of her bed so she didn't have to strain. 

""I've worked with Ward before. He led the team in Arizona, back when he was a field agent and not the manager."" 

I nodded ""What was he like then? 

""The same. Smart. Calm. Always three steps ahead. He believed in the mission, but was driven for the results,"" she said with a short cough interrupting her, ""he was efficient, planned for the best outcome, always got the job done."" 

She looked me in the eyes ""I'm worried about him. The Veil is getting worse, and we haven't heard anything about plan B yet. I know he has it covered, but keep an eye on him, Derrick. Things might get worse before we can fix it."" 

""Hey, don't you worry about that. You've got some capable guys around here, im sure we will figure it out."" 

""I know you will,"" She said, ""You boy's make a great team."" 

I smiled ""We all do."" 

""Promise me something."" 

""Yeah?"" 

""When we finally get all the cracks taken care of around here, you'll take out that girl you mentioned."" She stated, raising an eyebrow. 

""You mean Gabs?"" 

""Yeah, Gabs."" She turned her head to face me more, ""Don't let all of this keep you from doing right by her, and yourself."" 

I shook my head, ""I'm not sure an old wolf like me can do much right in that department."" 

She chuckled ""An old wolf like you, deserves his happy ending."" 

I simply nodded. Not sure whether to agree or disagree on that point. Maybe it was her med's talking. 

""Get some rest, Sam. Get well."" 

I left her bedside and strolled out of the building into the sunlight. I looked back and whispered to myself, ""Happy retirement, Sam. You've earned it."" 

The rest of the day left me with a lot to ponder over. We were headed towards something, and fast. I wasn't sure if it was a brick wall or a cliff. Sam was right though. We weren't given any new instructions about the Veil, just the same routine and be sure to check the equipment. I thought about what She said, about what Declan mentioned, if our method was now falling short of the goal and we needed a new strategy. 

Come to think of it, our stoic commander was much more absent lately. Not that he was here 24/7 anyways, he normally delegated tasks to his subordinates but he seemed a lot more absent even when he was here. His meetings with the Director had gotten more serious judging by their expressions when they exit the room upstairs. 

Surely Mason was kept busy dealing with logistics and the issues that are starting to arise, with the Veil pushing back harder and our agents getting injured. Sam wasn't the only one, but was the worst off. We kept busy too, keeping up our workload, but my gut told me this wasn't the priority now. Or more likely, someone wasn't allkwed off their leash. 

Some red flag kept waving in the back of my mind, though I wasn't entirely sure yet which way it was pointing. I reported to Ward now, as acting Field Lead for the team. He gave us our usual run of work to do. 

""Heres the agenda for the day. Three new targets to inspect and close out. Also a few areas to inspect for possible breaches."" 

I scrolled through the list of preliminary data. Seems like the list was shorter than usual. It all felt very copy and paste. 

""Any new directions regarding the tears?"" 

""No,"" he said flatly, ""We've experienced variables like this before, just proceed as normal. If you need backup, we can route another team to your location."" 

I held the pad, trying to read him as he divided his focus around the room. He turned back to me. 

""That's all, Wolfe. Good luck out there."" 

We proceeded through our day. Business as usual without any incident, thankfully,  although the anxiety was there for it. The Veil openings took a full minute and a half longer to close now. Thats about eighty seconds too long for my liking. My hand stayed resting against my leather holster as we counted down until each one would finally close. 

We managed to finish up our day early, ending about 2:00pm, then we took a late lunch. We sat around one of the old picnic tables at the Eastside park, enjoying something hot and cheap from the corner store nearby. Noah was slurping on a microwaved bowl of cheap ramen, Chris got some wrap with beef, and I grabbed a hot sandwich. 

Between the sounds of our chewing I finally came to a decision about something that had been rattling around in my brain. 

""Hey Noah, you said your good with software, right?"" 

""Yeah?"" 

""You know how to find back doors into things, get into data storage?"" 

He tilted his head a little, ""I open doors to other dimensions. Hacking private data is a piece of cake."" 

Chris laughed ""Technically, we ring the doorbell."" 

Noah snorted ""Technically, we throw bombs at aliens. But whatever,"" he turned back to me, ""What do you want to get into?"" 

""I want to look into Spyglass, see what the data logs are showing versus what we're seeing out here."" 

Noah looked to Chris and then back to me, ""Okay..."" Noah said slowly, still unsure. 

I glanced between them. ""Isn't it odd to either of you that there's no updates on the procedures? No new equipment for Declan to give us, or any new action from the analysts to help figure out whats going on?"" 

They looked to each other then back to me. 

""Yeah, it has gotten pretty stale,"" Chris said ""we used to get more detailed data, but a lot of it hasn't changed much lately. Like we had an uptake in reports, then it flat-lined."" 

Noah had a far away look in his eye, like he was looking through us at something else. 

""I didn't say anything yet because I wasn't sure if I've been reading things right... I thought maybe the Spyglass program was a little buggy, so I've been taking my own readings with my old storm chaser software."" He said, setting his drink down, ""I've been monitoring the harmonics the Veil produces, the signal we follow to find them. The resonance fluctuates, normally, before spiking where a tear occurs."" 

""Yeah?"" I said

""The resonance has been drifting. It's the same frequencies, but its been changing slightly. Getting stronger. The fluctuations are spread out a lot further than before."" 

He looked at me now, a hint of fear in his eyes. ""I'm afraid we might be in the calm before the storm."" 

""We need to get in there and find out what's going on,"" Chris said, ""get the real data. As much as the system monitors, it has to have it stored somewhere in the servers."" 

""Yeah, but it's not like we can just log in,"" Noah said, ""it's definitely encrypted. There's all kinds of sensitive data that it sorts through constantly. There's a lot we can't see."" 

I thought for a second ""We need the Director's access. If anyone is able to see the data, without restrictions, it's Mason."" 

""Well, if we're gonna do this,"" Chris began, ""we better get Declan on-board. Only technicians are allowed in the server room and he's in charge of the maintenance.  Besides, if we get caught, he will be in hot water too."" 

We were in agreement with what we were about to do. With that, we finished up our lunch, packed up and headed back to HQ to end our shift early for the day and then speak to the man himself. What we wanted to do, what I convinced us to do, was a serious breach in protocols, so I had to be certain Declan was willing to risk it. 

We met him out in his garage and slowly explained the plan to him and our reasoning behind it. I knew he was listening intently because his hands were in his pockets instead of fidgeting with a tool. The only thing that moved was his eyes shifting between us as we each took our turn speaking. 

Declan listened without interrupting.

He stood there, occasionally nodding as we laid it out. The missing data, the odd absences, the feeling that our oversight wasn't giving us the whole picture. 

Declan scratched his beard. “So,” he said slowly, “what are you actually hoping to find?.” 

“Hopefully, missing data.” Chris said. “The updated logs, equipment orders, anything really thats been left out.” 

“The truth.” I said flatly 

Noah chipped in ""All I need is access, I can take it from there."" 

Declan sighed. “And if I say no?” 

I looked him in the eye. “Then we stop. Right here.” 

That gave Declan pause. As if us not doing this sounded worse. 

He glanced out the bay door, then back at us. “You’re not chasing a theory,” he said. “I've been watching and listening. I know its getting bad out there."" 

He turned to me ""I've also had more equipment turn up missing. nobody knows or seems to care.” 

Chris nodded. “So, you'll help?"" 

""Im in,"" he said, ""but I can do better than access."" 

He moved over to the electronics workbench, reached into his kit and pulled out a small device with a few cables attached. “Its a diagnostic relay. If anyone checks the server, it’ll look like routine maintenance. While the system's in diagnostic mode, It's the only time your able to get around all the firewalls, no log-in required.” 

Noah grinned. “I like him."" 

He chuckled "" Hey, I'm only giving ya our most critical blind spot, so let's not get too comfy about risking our hides."" 

We hooked Declan up to our comms and sent him to work. We thought he might have been caught when one of the analysts asked why he was going to run another diagnostic on the system after they just ran one that morning. Declan told him ""I don't want 'Payne in the arse' to throw a wrench at my head if his tablet doesn't refresh fast enough for him."" That let him right on by into the server room. He locked the door behind himself. 

Declan whistled softly as he worked, complaining about outdated hardware for the benefit of his captive audience. 

""Okay,"" he said over the earpiece, ""diagnostics are active. Go ahead kid."" 

Noah didn’t waste time. 

He plugged in an external hard drive and opened up his software. His fingers moved fast, typing in commands into a custom system prompt, keying in passwords and executing his coded break-in. It was a bit over my head, but he did his thing. 

“Okay… normal traffic… anomaly reports… archived field analytics…” 

Then he slowed. 

“Huh,” he said. “That’s odd.” 

I leaned in toward his screen. “What is it?” 

“GPS logs,” Noah said. “But they’re scrubbed. Someone removed the identifiers, and the timestamps. There might be some coordinates left in the meta data.” 

Chris frowned. “Whose GPS?” 

“Save it,"" I said, ""Might be the Director, or Ward.” 

""Already done,” Noah said. “Encrypted local copy.” 

He kept digging. 

Personnel transfers. Equipment requisitions. Timestamps for video calls. What would normally be mundane logistics, but we viewed everything with a critical eye. This wasn't our smoking gun yet, but Noah was getting warmer. 

Then he stopped completely. 

There it was. We all saw it at the same time. A directory that technically didn't exist in the main database. No name. No description. Just a blacked out storage file sitting behind layers of security that made Noah hesitate mid-keystroke. The clearance level to this was labeled ""Overwatch"". Nobody knew what it was, but were certain we weren't meant to open this. 

“I can't break into it,” Noah said quietly. “Not without triggering all the alarms.” 

“Can you take it?” I asked. 

Noah nodded. “Yeah. Whatever’s in there, I can lift the whole thing. But the security comes with it too.” He turned back to me. 

“Do it.” 

With a click of the keyboard, a progress bar crawled forward. When it finished, none of us spoke for a moment. Noah unplugged the hard drive and held it in his hand as if it would bite him. 

Chris broke the silence. “So. Now what?” 

I already knew the answer. 

“There’s one person I trust with this,” I said. “And she’s going to hate that I waited this long.” 

Noah smirked. “Gabs?” 

“Yeah, Gabs” I confirmed. 

We all sat around now in Declan's workshop. All eyes on me as I scrolled through my contacts. My finger hovered over the button for a moment. Feeling the pressure, I stood up and slowly walked out under the afternoon sky. Why did calling her make me more anxious than shooting at monsters? 

It's more than just hearing her voice again after so long. I was about to invite her into our secret world, a dangerous one with monsters, secret organizations and cracks in reality itself. Bringing her in puts her in danger... But, I trust her. I know I can count on her. 

My finger found the button, and the call started ringing. 

I took one look back to the guys. Declan was reclined back casually on his chair. Noah and Chris both gave me a thumbs up. 

Ring... 

Ring... 

My heart Pounded. 

""Hello? Derrick?"" She answered. 

""H-hey Gabs. Its been a while."" I said, my voice a little more nervous than I wanted. 

""Hey! Yeah, it has. How are you? Last I heard you retired, how did that happen?"" 

She asked as if I had broken a leg. 

""Well, sort of. It didn't stick though. I'm working private now, on the side."" 

""Figures,"" she laughed, ""You never could stay still for long. Well, got any good cases?"" she paused ""Or... leads?"" 

I froze for a moment, ""No, mostly new stuff...""  I knew what, rather, who she was referring to. 

I cleared my throat. ""You know, I do miss working with you, Gabs. Would you... Would you mind catching up over dinner? Maybe my place?"" 

I could almost feel her smile through the phone. ""Yeah, I would like that. It would be great to see you again. It's not the same around here without you, ya know."" 

""Okay, great. See you tomorrow at six then?"" 

""Yep, that's perfect. I'll see you there."" 

We said our goodbyes and hung up. I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. 

Dinner with Gabs. I never thought we would go there, certainly not like this. A hand surprised me on my shoulder, I turned to see Chris. 

He smiled and Nodded, ""Don't worry, I've got your back. We all do."" 

I returned his smile. There's a lot riding on this dinner date. Not just cracking open an encrypted file, but hopefully convincing her we all hadn't gone crazy when we tell her why. But I'm feeling confident, despite my jitters. Especially knowing my team is right beside me every step. ",1,1769289920.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Asked for a Large Drink + Light Ice.
They gave me a light drink, large ice. Went to complain and they said the idea/reasoning for this is that they want the ice to melt/dilute the drink to fill the remaining volume and make it less strong because the the coffee is supposedly strong(hardly, but thats what we wanted, a strong coffee).

 They said if we wanted a full coffee, we would have to ask for MORE COFFEE(not free, we would have to pay), so they just added more milk to ""appease"" us. I'm sorry but if I ask for a large cup, i dont mean for the cup to be large, I feel like we can agree that a large cup means a large portion and not just the container.",6,1769289875.0,Stockton,4,0.65,False

I'd been arranging lunches and coffees with people as per the usual, including her, and when I arrived, there she was with her kid (just under 2 years old). Now, mind, the kids, in spite of their age, is perfectly well behaved; but the entire focus is on the kid. There's no catching up, there's no actual chatting — it's all: ""show auntie your toy!"" ""oh, you're slipping off there!"" ""oh look at her eating that berry"" and on and on...

This happened last spring and I have just been stewing on this, but haven't wanted to vocalize this to anyone in my life because I do feel like a little shit. Coming across this sub, I just needed to rant it out.

I'll be honest, I've barely spoken to her since. Not out of being a grump (or maybe I am!) but it's a feeling of, well I guess this is how it is now, it is what it is. And I still feel like a little shit! We've been friends for a long time.

It'll be our first trip to Japan. We have booked a hotel in Akasaka for easy access to the different transit lines and a more relaxed vibe. So far all I have is a rough draft of the different areas.

Day 1: Shibuya, harajuku, meiji shrine, Shibuya sky

Day 2: ueno, Tokyo national museum, asakusa, sonsoji temple, Akihabara

Day 3:Shinjuku, shimokitazawa

Day4:yanesen, yanaka ginza

Day 5: Akasaka, hei jinja, kichijoji, koenji

I'm not sure if this seems overly ambitious on some days or if some of the areas could be grouped more efficiently. We usually love to explore when we travel. I plan on using tabelog to find places to eat wherever we happen to be. We are foodies, love coffee, vinyl, vintage and trendy clothing, books. We are really interested in anything unique to Tokyo that we can experience.

I really want to make this a special trip. Any help or recommendations for cool places to eat, shop, and explore would be greatly appreciated.",0,1769289826.0,JapanTravelTips,3,0.5,False
1qlzd3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1qlzd3x/broken_veil_part_6/,Broken Veil (Part 6),"[Part1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ZV6d4o1mA9) [Part2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/mev6Ddzpga) [Part3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/s/IJarcZAUr3) [Part4](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/s/CSXQhJjL6I) [Part5](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/s/duAJeNIgdr) 

Once you get into a new routine, the days seem to roll by like clockwork. Not that any of those days lacked for excitement. Ward kept us busy with new assignments each day. Noah kept us aware and alert as we traversed every tree and dark corner. 

We had some varied missions as the weeks rolled by. Some went back to the forest, others took us through suburban cul-de-sacs and into the darker alleys of the citie's back lots. 

Our covers were just as interesting. One day we were city inspectors checking on new construction downtown. Another day we were back to being park rangers, hunting down a rumor of a chupacabra. We knew what it was. 

My favorite one, we were disguised as plumbers. A hotel had lost water supply to their ground floor pool and it stopped circulating. Took some diagnosing, turned out an eel-like creature had lodged itself into the filtration system. We had to cut the pipe to remove it, and when it wriggled free of its confinement, Chris was startled backwards when it slithered out after him and he fell into the pool. I hadn't laughed that hard in a while. 

Sam and I handeled the investigations. Several times we followed some obscure trail to the end of the line, scraps left for evidence, only to find the subtle leftover trace of where the veil closed and our person had vanished. Those felt all too familiar, but at least now there was a final preventative measure to seal away the gap. 

One occasion we managed to get to someone in time, a woman out for a jog happened to pass by where an Event tossed out another creature. That time we had to play the part of Animal Control. Me and Chris spun the distraught woman a tale about a rabies infected dog that we had to put down for public safety. I think she will still be signing up for therapy at some point. 

I wasn't sure about the other team's progress, but I felt like we were doing some good work. We brought back tons of data on the breaches, completed our runs early and we kicked back and enjoyed the rest from our hard work just as much. All in all, I was enjoying myself again. 

Still, there were some things that weren't quite on the level for me. 

According to Noah, the openings from the Veil were starting to misbehave. When we would close them, it took a bit longer than expected. Maybe just a few seconds, but some took more effort than others. As if there was more pressure from the other side. Noah would make his recordings and file them but Ward never seemed too concerned about those details. Just affirmed a job well done. 

Declan made a comment the other day about having requested new parts and materials and not all of the orders showed up. It wouldn't be much, smaller items like screws, wire spools and a single stabilizer unit missing. He figured one of the teams was snagging them, although none confessed. 

Come to think of it, Ward never really showed much emotion one way or the other about the situation. Whatever military branch he came from must have hardened him like stone, never wavering in his demeanor. Just acknowledged our reports, passed on the data where it needed to go, and set us up with our next assignments when it was time. I have to say, he was very efficient as Chief of Operations. 

The Director, however, seemed a little more tired each day. Apparently our little township was struggling a bit more to resolve than other places they've worked. New readings kept flowing in, new missions to pin to the board. More investigations meant more paperwork.  

The other teams must have felt the pressure too. Someone finally snapped. 

I came in to the office one day, just me and Noah. Sam and Chris were handling a run on their own. We only had two openings to inspect that day and they offered to go while we stayed and took care of some busy work for Declan. I walked in, coffee in hand with Noah in tow, to find someone shouting, then they tossed something in Declan's direction. 

""Your tech is broken, Rourke. We had to fire three charges into a fissure before it would even budge."" The man shouted, stepping up to Declan and poking a finger at him. 

""Two of those things came out after us, and almost got Jack."" 

Declan didn't back down. 

""I told you before, you need to calibrate the stabilizers first, otherwise the charges are not as effective."" 

""Oh, so its my fault we almost got our faces eaten off!?"" 

Declan snickered ""In your case, it might be an improvement."" 

He lunged at Declan, and the two men struggled for a moment. I quickly set my coffee down and got between them, pushing the man away from Declan. 

""Alright that's enough. Whatever this is, this isn't how to handle it."" 

The man squared up to me now. He was slightly taller than me, dark hair greased back over his ears. Mustache that combed over his top lip. Aviator glasses that had just enough tint to block out the sun. 

He was dressed as you might imagine, in jeans, a dark polo shirt, and a solid colored military style jacket with pockets across the chest and a raised collar with a zipper down the middle. I got the sense he was the more ""modern"" version of me. Albeit with an 80's kind-of style. 

I met his gaze behind the tinted lenses, staring back under the brim of my hat. 

""If you got a problem, we can talk it out, man to man."" I said 

He smiled a toothy grin ""Big bad wolf to the rescue. Tell me, did you buy that detective outfit in a costume store?"" 

""Same place you found that mustache and glasses."" 

""Oh. He's got jokes."" He snapped back ""Why don't you head on back to whatever newspaper comic you fell out of and let the real detectives do their work."" 

I smiled ""Because guys like you need guys like me to pick up all the slack you leave behind."" 

He scoffed ""Uh huh. Tell you what, you stick to your side, stay outta my way, and we won't have any issues."" 

""Sure thing, slick,"" I took a step closer, ""But you come at my people, and your mustache doesn't make it past 'Go'. Clear?"" 

He looked at me for a moment, then turned around and walked back towards the open side door and out of the building. 

People like that irritate me. No respect. 

I turned back to Noah and Declan ""So, who was that wanna-be?"" 

""Richard Payne,"" Noah said 

""Dick,"" Declan corrected ""He was a homicide detective in Florida."" 

Noah Continued, ""He's always been a jerk. I still don't know why they recruited him."" 

""He's certainly a pain. What was he going on about?"" I asked Declan. 

Declan looked between me and Noah, quietly like someone else might be listening. ""Come with me over to the garage."" 

We headed out the same side bay and across to one of the smaller buildings. The roller door was up, revealing a workshop inside. All the equipment and tool cabinets were on rollers, making it easy to pack things up if they needed to adjust the space or clear out quickly. 

He had all manner of power equipment and hand tools, and each area was roughly organized for different operations or equipment he was working on. Lathes, a drill press, and machining tools were grouped off to one side. Hand tools, material storage bins, and an electronics work station were on the other side. In the middle was a desk pushed flush against the wall alongside a flat workbench and an old sofa. 

Noah sat down in a high stool by Declan's desk, spinning around once and back to us, resting his arm on the surface. Declan picked a screwdriver off the workbench to fidget between his fingers. 

""Firstly, that guy is an imbecile."" He said pointing it out the door, ""I've told him three times to calibrate the stabilizers on each run. They have to sync to the anomaly to stabilize it properly."" 

Noah nodded along muttering ""Mmhmm."" 

""But also,"" he scratched his head, ""there are some weird things happening lately."" 

""Is there anything wrong with the gear?"" Noah asked plainly. 

""No, I don't think so. Im not the only engineer ANCR has, but I've been working on this tech for a while now and it does what it's supposed to. If you use it properly, that is."" 

I took a breath ""Why does it work at all? What is the Veil supposed to be anyways?"" 

Declan thought for a moment. 

""We don't know exactly,"" he chuckled, ""I have a friend who has a theory."" 

""Oh yeah?"" 

""He worked at the VLA in New Mexico, listening to the stars for signals. He tells me one day, they picked up a reading far out there that matches the exact frequency we track from the Veil. Said the signal emanates, faintly but clear, out of a black hole."" 

Noah and I exchanged shocked expressions 

""What?"" I blurted out 

""For real? So It's aliens?"" Noah said, wide eyed like he had just won a prize. 

Declan laughed heartily ""Ah, you should see your faces. No, it's not aliens. At least, none that say 'Hi' back."" He paused ""That is true though, about the signal... Still, we have no idea what or where the Veil is."" 

""It has to be some kind of door, how else are things getting through?"" I said 

""It's sort of like a door,"" he mused, ""yet more like a window with a curtain."" 

He paused for a moment 

""You both know about Nikola Tesla, right?"" 

We nodded. 

Declan leaned back against the bench, arms mid-gesture and eyes forward like he was readying to tell a great story. 

“Back at the turn of the twentieth century,” he began, “Nikola Tesla was obsessed with energy. Not electricity in the way Edison thought of it, all wires and lights, but frequency. How energy moves through space itself.” 

Noah nodded. “Wireless before it was cool.” 

“Before it was safe,” Declan added. “Tesla believed the Earth behaved like a massive conductor. He did all kinds of experiments where he would channel electricity in different ways, absorbing it and sending it out miles away.” 

“So he thought of the planet like a lightning rod?"" I asked. 

Declan pointed at me. “Exactly. Only in reverse.” 

He exhaled through his nose. “Wardenclyffe Tower was supposed to prove it. True wireless power. Global communication. Free energy sent to anywhere on the planet.” 

Noah swiveled in his chair. “But, it didn't work?"" 

""No... Not the way he wanted."" He said. 

""He was at his wits end trying to make it work. The tower needed more power, but it was operational. The investors backed out. He was livid, but determined to make it work. That night, in a blind fury, he turned it on. Maxed out every generator in the tower to critical. And then..."" 

He clapped his hands together 

""It fired a pulse of energy so powerful that it split the sky."" 

  

Noah was hanging on the edge of his seat. So was I. 

“Tesla didn’t just hit the Earth’s natural frequency,” he said. “He rung it like a bell."" 

He tapped the edge of metal bowl with his screwdriver, making it sing for emphasis. 

""Loud enough that whatever boundary separates… well, here from there, it cracked.” 

I felt a chill creep up my spine. “You’re saying he tore a hole in reality?” 

Declan shook his head slowly. “No. It was more like he cracked the window.” 

“The experiment shut down before it could stabilize. Equipment, now broken, was dismantled. Tesla died thinking he failed.” 

Noah spoke quietly. “But the crack didn’t go away.” 

Declan nodded. “It held. Weak at first. Decades passed. Technology advanced. Now there's radios, radar, satellites. Each one nudged the same harmonics again and again.” 

""That's when the cracks started getting bigger."" I continued his thought. 

He looked at me then. “Yes. Anyone and anything close enough could accidently slip through without warning. People, and cars. Planes disappeared mid flight. Ships would vanish, and sometimes reappear, damaged and abandoned."" 

""What about the creatures?"" I asked 

Declan's jaw tightened, ""Thats a new thing, they say. Over the last few years, the breaches started, a few were big ones."" He nodded towards Noah, ""But the number is increasing. Thats where we are now."" 

We sat for a moment staring at the floor. 

Finally, Noah spoke. “Then why is it getting worse?” 

He looked between us. 

“We close the Veil every time we find an opening. Why isn’t that enough?” 

Declan thought for a moment. 

""It should be. We've always been able to repair the cracks, nice and neat, but it feels different now. Besides, we don't really know what it's like on the other side."" 

""Did anybody ever try to look?"" I asked. 

Noah turned to me, ""Yeah, they did a few times. I sent my own drone in there but the footage is always scrambled, even with a direct connection. Besides..."" he exhaled, ""you saw what happened to the monsters. Same thing probably happens to people."" 

""No one has ever survived going to the other side."" Declan confirmed. 

He snapped his fingers ""Maybe... the tech works, but maybe the method is off."" He started pacing, ""What if we're just throwing stones in the pond, trying to stop the waves, but instead the waves just amplify. You end up with bigger waves. More frequency."" 

""And now,"" I continued, ""the waves are starting to swamp the boat."" 

He nodded, but before he could say more, we heard the sound of screeching tires and brakes locking up. We ran out to see the old Forestry truck was back. Chris was leaning halfway in the passenger side, then he pulled out Sam in his arms. She had a tourniquet tied around her left shoulder, her lower arm covered in blood. 

""Get the medic, now!"" He shouted. 

She was quickly taken from his arms to a stretcher and wheeled into the adjacent building, which housed a makeshift field hospital. 

""What happened, Chris?"" I asked as he approached us. 

He had this flustered appearance, like he had run a marathon, but his eyes were steady. 

""We were able to get the first Tear closed, but the second... Just a moment after it collapsed, it tore open again. A big one came through, all teeth, spikes and some sort of bone plating. It got ahold of Sam's arm and slung her to the ground. Took all the ammo I had to bring it down."" 

I put a hand on his shoulder, ""You got her back safe. You did good."" 

He shook his head slowly, ""I was late. These things are getting worse, Derrick. I don't know whats going on."" 

""We were just talking about that."" Noah piped up. 

""Why don't you come in here and take a seat,"" Declan offered, ""I'll fetch you somethin' to drink while you take a break."" 

We waited for hours. Every minute felt like an eternity. Finally the surgeon came around to see us. 

""She's gonna be okay,"" She said, ""Above the elbow was lacerated and torn severely. Unfortunately we had to amputate, but we have her mended now. You can see her, but go easy. She is still groggy and will need her rest."" 

""Thanks Doc."" I replied. 

he guys left it up to me to check on her. Said it would feel more professional from me, one ex-officer to another, but I admit I was worried about her. 

The setup was clean for being put together in an old storage building. A full operating room in the back with a sterile environment screen and filtering, and multiple beds with separate curtains off to the side. 

Sam had the middle one. Ward was already there at the foot of her bed, standing straight, arms folded behind his back as usual. He nodded as I stepped beside him. 

She lay there under the sheets, connected to several wires and IVs. An oxygen tube hooked into her nose. Her left shoulder was wrapped up in a blanket of gauze. 

I stood beside him, reading his posture for a moment, then turning to Sam. Ward finally let his mask slip a little. Through his professional demeanor I could tell he was uncomfortable. 

""She's being transfered to West Lake Medical,"" he stated, "" It's a days drive from here, but they have a good trauma wing. She's out of this fight now."" 

We stood in silence for a moment, listening to the sound of beeping and whirring from the machines. Sam breathed slowly and steadily, eyes closed. 

""She's fortunate,"" he finally said ""Owens' field tourniquet prevented major blood loss."" 

He turned to me ""He did good, Wolfe. Got the situation handeled, and got her out quick."" 

I thought to pass on his compliments to Chris, though I doubted he would agree with the praise. 

He turned back to her, ""We will get this under control soon enough, seal up the cracks for good."" 

His phone started ringing. 

""I need to take this,"" he said, frowning at his smart watch, ""rest up, we'll talk later."" He said, regarding Sam and nodded to me before stepping out.

I stepped up beside her now, my hands clasped together in front of me. Her eyes fluttered open slowly and she looked around. 

""Hey... it's me,"" I said, ""the guys wanted to check in on you."" 

She cracked a smile, I grinned back, ""You look like you could use a drink. Too bad I forgot to bring my stool."" I teased 

She laughed weakly then winced at the pain. I gave her an apologetic smile for my dry humor. 

""He's got a point, you know."" She said weakly. 

""About?"" 

""Getting a handle on things."" She said looking up to me. 

I leaned in closer with my hands rested onto the side rail of her bed so she didn't have to strain. 

""I've worked with Ward before. He led the team in Arizona, back when he was a field agent and not the manager."" 

I nodded ""What was he like then? 

""The same. Smart. Calm. Always three steps ahead. He believed in the mission, but was driven for the results,"" she said with a short cough interrupting her, ""he was efficient, planned for the best outcome, always got the job done."" 

She looked me in the eyes ""I'm worried about him. The Veil is getting worse, and we haven't heard anything about plan B yet. I know he has it covered, but keep an eye on him, Derrick. Things might get worse before we can fix it."" 

""Hey, don't you worry about that. You've got some capable guys around here, im sure we will figure it out."" 

""I know you will,"" She said, ""You boy's make a great team."" 

I smiled ""We all do."" 

""Promise me something."" 

""Yeah?"" 

""When we finally get all the cracks taken care of around here, you'll take out that girl you mentioned."" She stated, raising an eyebrow. 

""You mean Gabs?"" 

""Yeah, Gabs."" She turned her head to face me more, ""Don't let all of this keep you from doing right by her, and yourself."" 

I shook my head, ""I'm not sure an old wolf like me can do much right in that department."" 

She chuckled ""An old wolf like you, deserves his happy ending."" 

I simply nodded. Not sure whether to agree or disagree on that point. Maybe it was her med's talking. 

""Get some rest, Sam. Get well."" 

I left her bedside and strolled out of the building into the sunlight. I looked back and whispered to myself, ""Happy retirement, Sam. You've earned it."" 

The rest of the day left me with a lot to ponder over. We were headed towards something, and fast. I wasn't sure if it was a brick wall or a cliff. Sam was right though. We weren't given any new instructions about the Veil, just the same routine and be sure to check the equipment. I thought about what She said, about what Declan mentioned, if our method was now falling short of the goal and we needed a new strategy. 

Come to think of it, our stoic commander was much more absent lately. Not that he was here 24/7 anyways, he normally delegated tasks to his subordinates but he seemed a lot more absent even when he was here. His meetings with the Director had gotten more serious judging by their expressions when they exit the room upstairs. 

Surely Mason was kept busy dealing with logistics and the issues that are starting to arise, with the Veil pushing back harder and our agents getting injured. Sam wasn't the only one, but was the worst off. We kept busy too, keeping up our workload, but my gut told me this wasn't the priority now. Or more likely, someone wasn't allkwed off their leash. 

Some red flag kept waving in the back of my mind, though I wasn't entirely sure yet which way it was pointing. I reported to Ward now, as acting Field Lead for the team. He gave us our usual run of work to do. 

""Heres the agenda for the day. Three new targets to inspect and close out. Also a few areas to inspect for possible breaches."" 

I scrolled through the list of preliminary data. Seems like the list was shorter than usual. It all felt very copy and paste. 

""Any new directions regarding the tears?"" 

""No,"" he said flatly, ""We've experienced variables like this before, just proceed as normal. If you need backup, we can route another team to your location."" 

I held the pad, trying to read him as he divided his focus around the room. He turned back to me. 

""That's all, Wolfe. Good luck out there."" 

We proceeded through our day. Business as usual without any incident, thankfully,  although the anxiety was there for it. The Veil openings took a full minute and a half longer to close now. Thats about eighty seconds too long for my liking. My hand stayed resting against my leather holster as we counted down until each one would finally close. 

We managed to finish up our day early, ending about 2:00pm, then we took a late lunch. We sat around one of the old picnic tables at the Eastside park, enjoying something hot and cheap from the corner store nearby. Noah was slurping on a microwaved bowl of cheap ramen, Chris got some wrap with beef, and I grabbed a hot sandwich. 

Between the sounds of our chewing I finally came to a decision about something that had been rattling around in my brain. 

""Hey Noah, you said your good with software, right?"" 

""Yeah?"" 

""You know how to find back doors into things, get into data storage?"" 

He tilted his head a little, ""I open doors to other dimensions. Hacking private data is a piece of cake."" 

Chris laughed ""Technically, we ring the doorbell."" 

Noah snorted ""Technically, we throw bombs at aliens. But whatever,"" he turned back to me, ""What do you want to get into?"" 

""I want to look into Spyglass, see what the data logs are showing versus what we're seeing out here."" 

Noah looked to Chris and then back to me, ""Okay..."" Noah said slowly, still unsure. 

I glanced between them. ""Isn't it odd to either of you that there's no updates on the procedures? No new equipment for Declan to give us, or any new action from the analysts to help figure out whats going on?"" 

They looked to each other then back to me. 

""Yeah, it has gotten pretty stale,"" Chris said ""we used to get more detailed data, but a lot of it hasn't changed much lately. Like we had an uptake in reports, then it flat-lined."" 

Noah had a far away look in his eye, like he was looking through us at something else. 

""I didn't say anything yet because I wasn't sure if I've been reading things right... I thought maybe the Spyglass program was a little buggy, so I've been taking my own readings with my old storm chaser software."" He said, setting his drink down, ""I've been monitoring the harmonics the Veil produces, the signal we follow to find them. The resonance fluctuates, normally, before spiking where a tear occurs."" 

""Yeah?"" I said

""The resonance has been drifting. It's the same frequencies, but its been changing slightly. Getting stronger. The fluctuations are spread out a lot further than before."" 

He looked at me now, a hint of fear in his eyes. ""I'm afraid we might be in the calm before the storm."" 

""We need to get in there and find out what's going on,"" Chris said, ""get the real data. As much as the system monitors, it has to have it stored somewhere in the servers."" 

""Yeah, but it's not like we can just log in,"" Noah said, ""it's definitely encrypted. There's all kinds of sensitive data that it sorts through constantly. There's a lot we can't see."" 

I thought for a second ""We need the Director's access. If anyone is able to see the data, without restrictions, it's Mason."" 

""Well, if we're gonna do this,"" Chris began, ""we better get Declan on-board. Only technicians are allowed in the server room and he's in charge of the maintenance.  Besides, if we get caught, he will be in hot water too."" 

We were in agreement with what we were about to do. With that, we finished up our lunch, packed up and headed back to HQ to end our shift early for the day and then speak to the man himself. What we wanted to do, what I convinced us to do, was a serious breach in protocols, so I had to be certain Declan was willing to risk it. 

We met him out in his garage and slowly explained the plan to him and our reasoning behind it. I knew he was listening intently because his hands were in his pockets instead of fidgeting with a tool. The only thing that moved was his eyes shifting between us as we each took our turn speaking. 

Declan listened without interrupting.

He stood there, occasionally nodding as we laid it out. The missing data, the odd absences, the feeling that our oversight wasn't giving us the whole picture. 

Declan scratched his beard. “So,” he said slowly, “what are you actually hoping to find?.” 

“Hopefully, missing data.” Chris said. “The updated logs, equipment orders, anything really thats been left out.” 

“The truth.” I said flatly 

Noah chipped in ""All I need is access, I can take it from there."" 

Declan sighed. “And if I say no?” 

I looked him in the eye. “Then we stop. Right here.” 

That gave Declan pause. As if us not doing this sounded worse. 

He glanced out the bay door, then back at us. “You’re not chasing a theory,” he said. “I've been watching and listening. I know its getting bad out there."" 

He turned to me ""I've also had more equipment turn up missing. nobody knows or seems to care.” 

Chris nodded. “So, you'll help?"" 

""Im in,"" he said, ""but I can do better than access."" 

He moved over to the electronics workbench, reached into his kit and pulled out a small device with a few cables attached. “Its a diagnostic relay. If anyone checks the server, it’ll look like routine maintenance. While the system's in diagnostic mode, It's the only time your able to get around all the firewalls, no log-in required.” 

Noah grinned. “I like him."" 

He chuckled "" Hey, I'm only giving ya our most critical blind spot, so let's not get too comfy about risking our hides."" 

We hooked Declan up to our comms and sent him to work. We thought he might have been caught when one of the analysts asked why he was going to run another diagnostic on the system after they just ran one that morning. Declan told him ""I don't want 'Payne in the arse' to throw a wrench at my head if his tablet doesn't refresh fast enough for him."" That let him right on by into the server room. He locked the door behind himself. 

Declan whistled softly as he worked, complaining about outdated hardware for the benefit of his captive audience. 

""Okay,"" he said over the earpiece, ""diagnostics are active. Go ahead kid."" 

Noah didn’t waste time. 

He plugged in an external hard drive and opened up his software. His fingers moved fast, typing in commands into a custom system prompt, keying in passwords and executing his coded break-in. It was a bit over my head, but he did his thing. 

“Okay… normal traffic… anomaly reports… archived field analytics…” 

Then he slowed. 

“Huh,” he said. “That’s odd.” 

I leaned in toward his screen. “What is it?” 

“GPS logs,” Noah said. “But they’re scrubbed. Someone removed the identifiers, and the timestamps. There might be some coordinates left in the meta data.” 

Chris frowned. “Whose GPS?” 

“Save it,"" I said, ""Might be the Director, or Ward.” 

""Already done,” Noah said. “Encrypted local copy.” 

He kept digging. 

Personnel transfers. Equipment requisitions. Timestamps for video calls. What would normally be mundane logistics, but we viewed everything with a critical eye. This wasn't our smoking gun yet, but Noah was getting warmer. 

Then he stopped completely. 

There it was. We all saw it at the same time. A directory that technically didn't exist in the main database. No name. No description. Just a blacked out storage file sitting behind layers of security that made Noah hesitate mid-keystroke. The clearance level to this was labeled ""Overwatch"". Nobody knew what it was, but were certain we weren't meant to open this. 

“I can't break into it,” Noah said quietly. “Not without triggering all the alarms.” 

“Can you take it?” I asked. 

Noah nodded. “Yeah. Whatever’s in there, I can lift the whole thing. But the security comes with it too.” He turned back to me. 

“Do it.” 

With a click of the keyboard, a progress bar crawled forward. When it finished, none of us spoke for a moment. Noah unplugged the hard drive and held it in his hand as if it would bite him. 

Chris broke the silence. “So. Now what?” 

I already knew the answer. 

“There’s one person I trust with this,” I said. “And she’s going to hate that I waited this long.” 

Noah smirked. “Gabs?” 

“Yeah, Gabs” I confirmed. 

We all sat around now in Declan's workshop. All eyes on me as I scrolled through my contacts. My finger hovered over the button for a moment. Feeling the pressure, I stood up and slowly walked out under the afternoon sky. Why did calling her make me more anxious than shooting at monsters? 

It's more than just hearing her voice again after so long. I was about to invite her into our secret world, a dangerous one with monsters, secret organizations and cracks in reality itself. Bringing her in puts her in danger... But, I trust her. I know I can count on her. 

My finger found the button, and the call started ringing. 

I took one look back to the guys. Declan was reclined back casually on his chair. Noah and Chris both gave me a thumbs up. 

Ring... 

Ring... 

My heart Pounded. 

""Hello? Derrick?"" She answered. 

""H-hey Gabs. Its been a while."" I said, my voice a little more nervous than I wanted. 

""Hey! Yeah, it has. How are you? Last I heard you retired, how did that happen?"" 

She asked as if I had broken a leg. 

""Well, sort of. It didn't stick though. I'm working private now, on the side."" 

""Figures,"" she laughed, ""You never could stay still for long. Well, got any good cases?"" she paused ""Or... leads?"" 

I froze for a moment, ""No, mostly new stuff...""  I knew what, rather, who she was referring to. 

I cleared my throat. ""You know, I do miss working with you, Gabs. Would you... Would you mind catching up over dinner? Maybe my place?"" 

I could almost feel her smile through the phone. ""Yeah, I would like that. It would be great to see you again. It's not the same around here without you, ya know."" 

""Okay, great. See you tomorrow at six then?"" 

""Yep, that's perfect. I'll see you there."" 

We said our goodbyes and hung up. I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. 

Dinner with Gabs. I never thought we would go there, certainly not like this. A hand surprised me on my shoulder, I turned to see Chris. 

He smiled and Nodded, ""Don't worry, I've got your back. We all do."" 

I returned his smile. There's a lot riding on this dinner date. Not just cracking open an encrypted file, but hopefully convincing her we all hadn't gone crazy when we tell her why. But I'm feeling confident, despite my jitters. Especially knowing my team is right beside me every step. ",1,1769289812.0,TheMidnightArchives,0,1.0,False

Did some digging on brands and found Pacific foods organic coconut milk at Whole Foods. The ingredients looked as similar as I’d seen in comparison to the Starbucks version. Here’s what I did:

Made the base as suggested on the bottle (1:1 ratio of base to water)

Poured into cup over ice and just started adding coconut milk until it reached the color I was aiming for. Us pink drink lovers know just by looking at one of it’ll be the flavor we want. (I like mine slightly more on the “drink” side I would say, so closer to lighter pink)

Voila! Final product and it tastes as similar to one as you can get outside of the store.

1qlzaau,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qlzaau/most_people_are_using_caffeine_completely_wrong/,Most people are using caffeine completely wrong,"
Here's the thing nobody tells you about caffeine, it's not just a morning ritual or a pick me up. It's a powerful cognitive enhancer when used correctly, and a productivity destroyer when abused. After diving deep into neuroscience research, particularly Dr. Andrew Huberman's work on caffeine and dopamine systems, plus insights from Matthew Walker's sleep studies and James Hoffmann's coffee science, I realized most people are using caffeine completely wrong. They're building tolerance, crashing hard, and wondering why their third cup doesn't hit like it used to. Let's fix that.

## Step 1: Understand What Caffeine Actually Does to Your Brain

Caffeine doesn't give you energy. Read that again. It blocks adenosine receptors in your brain. Adenosine is the sleepiness chemical that builds up throughout the day. When caffeine blocks these receptors, you don't feel tired, but you're not actually more energized. You've just removed the brake pedal.

Here's the kicker, caffeine also increases dopamine and adrenaline. That's why you feel more alert and motivated. But this is where most people screw up. They consume caffeine all day, building tolerance, and then wonder why they need more and more to feel anything.

**The Research**: Dr. Huberman explains that caffeine has a half life of about 5 6 hours. That means if you drink coffee at 2 PM, half of that caffeine is still in your system at 8 PM. Quarter of it at 2 AM. No wonder you can't sleep.

## Step 2: Delay Your First Cup (This Sounds Crazy But Works)

Most people wake up and immediately reach for coffee. Big mistake. When you first wake up, cortisol levels are naturally high. Cortisol is your body's natural alertness hormone. Drinking caffeine during this cortisol spike does two things: it blunts the natural awakening response and builds tolerance faster.

**The Strategy**: Wait 90 120 minutes after waking before your first cup. Let your natural cortisol do its job. When cortisol starts dipping (usually around 9 10 AM), that's when caffeine hits hardest.

Dr. Huberman calls this   delaying caffeine intake   and it's backed by chronobiology research. Your adenosine levels are low in the morning anyway. Save the caffeine for when you actually need it.

## Step 3: Dose It Right (More Isn't Better)

The sweet spot for cognitive enhancement is 1 3 mg of caffeine per kilogram of body weight. For most people, that's 100 200mg, roughly one strong cup of coffee or two shots of espresso.

Going beyond 400mg daily increases anxiety, jitters, and diminishing returns. You're not getting more focus. You're just getting more side effects.

**Pro Tip**: Track your intake. Most people underestimate how much caffeine they consume. That energy drink? 200mg. That pre workout? Another 300mg. Suddenly you're at 700mg and wondering why your heart's racing.

## Step 4: Strategic Timing Windows

Caffeine peaks in your bloodstream 30 45 minutes after consumption. Plan accordingly.

* **Morning Focus Block**: Consume caffeine 90 120 minutes after waking for peak morning productivity.
* **Afternoon Slump**: If needed, have a small dose around 1 2 PM, but cut off all caffeine by 2 PM to protect sleep.
* **Pre Workout**: 30 45 minutes before exercise maximizes performance benefits.

Never consume caffeine within 10 hours of bedtime if you value sleep quality. Matthew Walker's research in   Why We Sleep   shows even small amounts of afternoon caffeine significantly reduce deep sleep, even if you   feel fine.  

## Step 5: Cycle Your Intake (Break the Tolerance Trap)

Your brain adapts to everything, including caffeine. Drink it daily, and your adenosine receptors upregulate. Translation: you need more caffeine to feel the same effect.

**The Fix**: Take 5 7 day caffeine breaks every 6 8 weeks. Yeah, you'll feel like garbage for 2 3 days (withdrawal headaches are real), but you'll reset your tolerance. When you come back, that first cup will feel like rocket fuel again.

Alternatively, practice   caffeine rotation.   Have high caffeine days (200mg+) and low caffeine days (under 100mg). Your brain doesn't fully adapt.

## Step 6: Pair It With L Theanine for Smooth Focus

Caffeine alone can make you jittery and anxious. L theanine, an amino acid found in tea, smooths out the rough edges. The combo gives you alert focus without the crash or anxiety.

**The Ratio**: 100mg caffeine with 200mg L theanine. Green tea naturally has both, but you can also supplement.

Research published in the *Journal of Nutrition* showed this combination significantly improved attention and reduced mind wandering compared to caffeine alone. It's the difference between frantic energy and calm focus.

## Step 7: Use Caffeine Naps (Sounds Backwards, Actually Genius)

Here's a wild technique: drink a cup of coffee, then immediately take a 20 minute nap. By the time you wake up, the caffeine kicks in, and you've cleared some adenosine buildup during the nap. Double boost.

Studies show caffeine naps are more effective than either coffee or naps alone for combating afternoon fatigue. Set a timer, down your coffee, close your eyes. You'll wake up sharper than you've felt in weeks.

## Step 8: Quality Matters More Than You Think

Not all caffeine is created equal. Coffee quality affects how you feel. Cheap, over roasted coffee has more diterpenes, which can cause digestive issues and inflammation.

James Hoffmann, in his book   The World Atlas of Coffee,   breaks down how processing methods affect caffeine content and absorption rates. Light roasts actually have slightly more caffeine than dark roasts (contrary to popular belief).

For clean, sustained energy, opt for specialty coffee, freshly ground. The difference in how you feel is noticeable.

## Step 9: Hydrate or Die (Literally)

Caffeine is a mild diuretic. You pee more. Dehydration tanks focus faster than anything else. For every cup of coffee, drink a glass of water.

Most   caffeine crashes   are actually dehydration and blood sugar drops. Keep water nearby and sip consistently.

## Step 10: Know When to Skip It

Caffeine is a tool, not a crutch. If you're chronically exhausted, drinking more coffee won't fix the root problem. It'll mask it while you dig yourself deeper into sleep debt.

Signs you need a break:

* You need caffeine just to feel normal
* Multiple cups don't help anymore
* You're anxious or jittery constantly
* Sleep quality sucks

When that happens, take a week off. Fix your sleep. Address stress. Caffeine enhances a foundation. It doesn't build one.

## Step 11: Experiment and Track Results

Everyone's caffeine metabolism is different. Some people are fast metabolizers (CYP1A2 gene variant), others are slow. Fast metabolizers can handle more caffeine. Slow metabolizers get jittery and anxious easily.

Track your intake, timing, and how you feel. Use apps like Insight Timer or a simple notes app. After two weeks, patterns emerge. You'll know your optimal dose and timing.

## Resources Worth Your Time

**  Caffeine Blues   by Stephen Cherniske** dives into how caffeine affects your adrenal system and long term energy. Cherniske was a caffeine addict who went through withdrawal hell and documented everything. Insanely good read if you want to understand the dark side of overconsumption.

**Huberman Lab Podcast** (specifically episodes on caffeine, dopamine, and focus) breaks down the neuroscience in digestible terms. Huberman's a Stanford neuroscientist who translates research into actionable protocols. His caffeine episode changed how thousands use coffee.

**BeFreed** is an AI powered learning app worth checking out if you want to dive deeper into cognitive optimization without reading dozens of books. It pulls from neuroscience research, expert talks, and book summaries to create personalized audio learning sessions based on what you're trying to improve. You can customize everything from a quick 10 minute summary to a 40 minute deep dive with examples, and pick your preferred voice style. It also builds adaptive learning plans tailored to your specific goals, like optimizing focus and energy management. The platform connects insights from resources like Huberman's work, Walker's sleep research, and other cognitive science materials into structured sessions that fit your schedule.

**The Ash app** helps track mood and habits, including caffeine intake. It's like a relationship coach for your brain chemistry. You log consumption and symptoms, it shows patterns you'd never notice otherwise.

## The Bottom Line

Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive drug on the planet. Used strategically, it's a cognitive enhancer that boosts focus, motivation, and performance. Used carelessly, it's an anxiety trigger and sleep destroyer that leaves you dependent and exhausted.

Delay your first cup. Dose appropriately. Time it right. Take breaks. Pair with L theanine. Protect your sleep. Track your results.

Do this, and caffeine becomes a precision tool instead of a daily crutch. Your focus will sharpen. Your energy will stabilize. And you'll finally understand why that first cup used to hit so damn hard.",3,1769289634.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

Hola.
Soy de las personas que no puede quedarse encerrada mucho tiempo porque se deprime.
De febrero a diciembre me arreglo con las bibliotecas de la UNA, pero el verdadero problema son los sábados,  domingos, feriados y eneros.

Estoy buscando lugares decentes para estudiar o trabajar (cafeterías, ciber cafés, bibliotecas, etc.).
Con “decente” me refiero a:

Privacidad

Mesas grandes o cómodas

Wi-Fi + enchufes

Música baja (o idealmente nada)


Dejo las opciones que ya conozco para que tengan referencia y, ojalá, recomienden lugares similares.


---

Mis opciones

1. La Cafeteka (frente a la UNA)
Actualmente cerrada, dicen que reabre.
Pros: Mesas grandes, ambiente tranqui, te podés quedar horas sin estrés.
Contras: A veces música demasiado fuerte y precios algo altos.

2. La Cafebrería (cerca del centro)
Pros: Buen lugar, casi siempre vacío, ambiente ok.
Contras: Mesas chicas, pocos espacios privados, a veces hay shows con mucho ruido. No todos los sectores tienen enchufes (especialmente el patio).

3. Spacio 1 (frente a Paseo Galería)
Pros: Lugar PERFECTO: planta alta, cubículos, sin música, buen internet y barato.
Contras: Casi nunca está abierto al público. Desde fines del año pasado siempre que voy está cerrado. F en el chat.

4. Estaciones de servicio (en general)
Pros: Hay mesas, café y Wi-Fi.
Contras: No están pensadas para estudiar. Mucho ruido, gente entrando y saliendo. Si tenés ADHD, no sirven.
Mi favorita: la Petromax sobre Mcal. López, cerca de la Municipalidad de Asunción.

5. Cafeterías de shopping (Juan Valdez, Café Martínez, etc.)
Mismo problema que arriba.
Ruido constante, mesas chicas y cero espacio para cuadernos/libros. Si necesitás silencio, descartadas.

6. Kaffe’i – Coffee Roasters
Pros: Buen lugar, ambiente agradable. Honestamente no tengo quejas.
Contras: Las mesas son redondas y pequeñas; básicamente entra solo la compu.

7. Bibliotecas públicas

Biblioteca Archivo Nacional (frente a la Costanera de Asunción)
Pros: Es una biblioteca, el lugar es lindo y casi siempre está vacío.
Contras: Cierra temprano (18:00 hs), NO TIENE WIFI, no tiene aire y casi no hay enchufes. Pinta bien, pero no es funcional.

Biblioteca Municipal Augusto Roa Bastos
Pros: Buen concepto general.
Contras: Pocos espacios y chicos, horarios confusos; muchas veces está cerrada. Cierra tempranísimo y no tiene aire.

1qlz3fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1qlz3fy/my_experience_7_weeks_guatemalan_language_school/,My experience 7 weeks Guatemalan Language School at 100-150 hours,"\*Speaking sample at the bottom\*

As with most in my life, I've been procrastinating making this post. From June 2025 to September 2025 I solo backpacked across Guatemala, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru. The journey started in Xela, Guatemala where I attended the Miguel Angel Asturias Spanish school for 7 weeks in hopes of boosting my Spanish to a conversational level to make navigating the rest of my trip easier. \*\*Disclaimer\*\* I'm not a DS purist.

  
**Cost:** The price of the school itself was $210 per week including homestay in a host family with 3x meals included and 5 days per week of 1-on-1 5 hour classes. What's not included are after school and weekend activities, usually field trips to artisanal workshops, historical sites, museums, etc. that the school has relationships with. They give tours in Spanish usually which is good CI. I tried to go to just about every activity to both learn and immerse in Guatemalan culture but also to bond with my classmates. 

  
**Classes:** At the start of your first week, we were assigned a private tutor who assessed our skills and created a roadmap of what to work on. Classes were tailored to our needs. If you wanted more speaking practice, you could just chat with your tutor and have them correct you. If you wanted textbook grammar study, they could teach you that as well. Tutors changed after every week, but if you liked your teacher, you could request to keep the same one. I changed twice before finding a teacher that really suited me and ended up staying with her for the remaining weeks. Classes were whatever we wanted them to be. Sometimes we played Spanish scrabble, made up stories with specific vocabulary, went to a cafe, read short stories, debated, it was whatever you wanted it to be. 

  
**Practice outside of class:** This part of the experience varies the most in my opinion. Before coming to Xela, I told myself I would only speak Spanish the moment I stepped foot in Guatemala. That fell through day 1 since my housemate ended up being a really awesome guy but whose Spanish wasn't at the level to have conversations yet so we just conversed in English. This bled into mealtime as well where we weren't able to have fluid conversations with the host family all-together and the same applied for classmates at school. Many come with no experience or an A1 level so we almost always ended up speaking English as to not leave anyone out. It made complete immersion more difficult but I wouldn't change a thing, as I really enjoyed getting to know everyone I met. This probably varies from school to school (we had about 25 students on average per week) and who you end up having as housemates and in your host family. I tried finding local meetups to practice speaking Spanish but the only one I could find wasn't currently meeting up. I met a couple locals and went to have coffee with them a couple times which was great conversation practice. Outside of that, I would say even little interactions at the market/laundromat helped reinforce the appropriate phrases to use in day-to-day situations. 

  
**My** **Spanish:** Before leaving for the trip, my Spanish journey was as follows:

* 4 years of high school Spanish (I did not use Spanish for the 10 years following high school except occasionally for my job)
* 3 summer visits during high school to Guatemala tagging along with a religious family member whose church does mission trips (part of the reason I chose Guatemala for the school)
* 100 hours of CI through Dreaming Spanish
* 25 hours of CI through podcasts
* 25 hours of speaking practice via iTalki tutors and an online penpal
* 50,000 words read

Before the trip, I would put myself at a B1 definitely for reading and writing, maybe a weak B1 for listening and speaking (most things in the 50s were comfortable for me, 60s depended on the topic). I want to underscore how important I actually feel high school Spanish was. Even though we received almost NO CI (I remember literally 1 occasion where we listened to something in Spanish), the grammar study actually provided a great foundation on which to build. Since progress is highly un-linear and varies person to person, I can only speak from personal experience but I would say that my general Spanish skills improved at a rate of 1.5x what it would normally be if I stayed home, did comprehensible input, and self studied. But that's because what I lacked mostly was good input which is something I could get at home. If you're someone who has no formal grammar study, I could see you getting more value out of a Spanish school. My Spanish did not dramatically improve after 7 weeks but I did iron out some grammatical uncertainties that had me pausing mid-speech, I improved my vocabulary, cleaned up a lot of basic grammar, got more practice with the subjunctive and imperative forms, increased my Spanish ""endurance"", and attuned my ear more to hearing Spanish spoken in person (versus online via headphones). And IMO the first 2 weeks are just for getting adjusted to the exhaustion that comes with 5 hour days of Spanish. 

That being said, the experience was 10000% worth it! Experiencing life in Guatemala was a wondrous time. Soaking up the culture, weather, and history, taking in the landscapes, spending time with new friends and my host family, and the plethora of meaningful experiences made it an unforgettable time. In the following month and a half of traveling across Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, I didn't have any issues communicating in most  relatively easy one-on-one interactions unless they had an accent I found difficult, and I was able to share some longer conversations in Spanish here and there. Still a long ways to go! If you have questions about that, you can ask in the comments!

Here's a sample of me speaking present day with about 225 hours of CI, 185 hours of speaking practice, and over 100k words read

I started off around 215 and now I’m 190. I’m 5’2 so I’m still a decent amount overweight. 

I’d be happier at 160, so only 30 pounds but I think my ultimate goal is to be closer to 140 I don’t think weight any less than that is realistic now that I’m almost 30. 

I no longer drink soda, which was a really big crutch for me. I subbed out a super sweet morning drink for à la colombe coffee which is still sweet but a lot less sugar than I used to drink. 

I eat twice a day at 11 and 5ish with no snacking in between. I do occasionally have a snack sized piece of candy to satisfy my sweet tooth. 

I work out around 3 times a week at barre, my goal is to do 144 classes over the year. 

I guess I don’t know what to do to keep my weight loss going or any ways to speed it up. Maybe by summer I’ll be at the 160, but I keep hearing that people stall with their weight loss and I’m not sure what to do about that. 

My insurance doesn’t cover any of the glp-1s and I’m not willing to do the online apps.

**Title:**  
🌲 I Built This With $50 of Scrap Wood — What Would You Change?

**Post Body:**  
So, this all started with a pile of mismatched 2x4s that were *definitely* headed for the dumpster.  
Instead of letting them turn to mulch, I challenged myself: *What can I actually build with $50 and what I already have lying around?*

A weekend later, I had something that’s half storage bench, half outdoor coffee table. It’s rough around the edges (literally), but I’m proud of it. Every crooked board tells a story of me still figuring things out.

Here’s what surprised me most — most of my “mistakes” didn’t come from not having fancy tools. It was me rushing measurements, not double‑checking alignment, or just picking the wrong grain direction. Once I slowed down, even scrap started to feel premium.

That whole experience pushed me to refresh my fundamentals.  
Wood doesn’t fight us — it reflects how patient and consistent we are.

If you’re like me and have wasted more wood than you’d like to admit, you might want to check this out — it walks through clean cuts, solid joints, and beginner‑friendly techniques:

I signed up mostly out of curiosity, and honestly? It helped me see *why* things were failing, not just how to fix them. If you’ve been struggling to get consistent results with basic tools — it’s worth a peek.

They’re even doing a big woodworking giveaway right now, which is kind of awesome. You can grab your free spot or check the course here:

Anyway, here’s my finished $50 scrap‑wood project (imagine something between “rustic charm” and “learning curve” 😅).  

If it were yours — what would you change or improve? Be honest; I can take it.  
And if this post inspires even one person to rescue another pile of scrap, I’ll call it a win.

1qlyzw9,https://i.redd.it/74ub4sc83dfg1.jpeg,Need advice: Which filament for this gear wheel?,"I’m trying to rescue my beloved coffee grinder. It stopped working because the ~~gear wheel~~ pulley that sits on the motor shaft and drives the grinding mechanism via a rubber belt has worn down.

Luckily, an amazing person from the 3D printing community created a replacement part for it which you can see above. Here is the link to the source:  
[https://www.printables.com/model/970113-wilfa-uniform-pulley/files](https://www.printables.com/model/970113-wilfa-uniform-pulley/files)

I have no clue about 3D printing, but I found someone who can print the part for me for just a handful of bucks.

However, I’m unsure which filament would be best. They suggested either PA6-CF or PA6-GF which I now know are not a good idea due to health risks. I want something sturdy that will hold up for a long time. What do you think would work best for this type of application?

Thank you so much in advance for your help!

(Edit 1: It's a ""pulley"" connected to a rubber belt, not a gear.

Edit 2: GF or CF is out because of health risks, since I can't guarantee 100% that abrasion particles won't touch the coffee grinds.)",1,1769288975.0,3Dprinting,19,1.0,False

[Heading into the weekend, silver hit a major milestone target, surpassing $100 an ounce](https://l.ca-1.a.mimecastprotect.com/l?domain=kitco.com&t=AQICAHjJ4QQrUx4gohCUGeSPB2tMZWKAgC9xzOTGPFOeSLPFOQECCt8KwNew9doQhEetfLMxAAAAzjCBywYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoIG9MIG6AgEAMIG0BgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEEDDEwVuXzc8NBUfFWygIBEICBhiYNZhhR7wmt-pHAFD62-AM_IIH_FZFFvE8hT-h7XcLYYcEuha0qwgSXkLWey-44eJpv8Yemw5JBanw7ceApLTnBkTspv5Aq5tEz9yOKbVxlsfUqAclhVO8MLfYGb5O7QZ0xlk_tWCagw5-QTXPMqQVDyQxxTFjdSsdfaGDV0Bq-yqNt3UYG&r=/s/35lnCWQB2tVxjqVDc6yqMOBs900DDjFjiWYsto). Gold hasn’t quite reached the $5,000 level yet, but the market is less than $20 away—and in this environment, that could happen before a trader’s morning coffee has time to cool.  
  
Silver prices are up 44% so far this month and more than 180% since the breakout rally began in the second half of last year. Last week, we warned investors that this rally was starting to look irrational, and that may still be the case. But as the old cliché goes: “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” Unfortunately, the market has an excellent memory, and your margin account does not.  
  
What is interesting, however, is that some analysts actually see a rationale behind gold’s and silver’s parabolic move. The precious metals saw renewed momentum at the start of the week after President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations that did not support his bid to annex Greenland. He also didn’t rule out using military force to get what he wanted. In a traditional TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) move, Trump later pulled back from his threat to take Greenland by force—but the damage had already been done.

While the price action looks wild and frothy, many analysts have said that these elevated prices make sense in a world facing extreme geopolitical and economic uncertainty.

Analysts say that both [gold](https://www.kitco.com/charts/gold) and [silver](https://www.kitco.com/charts/silver)’s rallies, while extremely overextended, are being driven by solid fundamentals.

In an interview with Kitco News, Chris Vecchio, head of futures strategies and forex at [Tastylive.com](http://Tastylive.com), said that there is solid demand for assets that are not tethered to the fiat world.

“ You're not really gonna go into silver if you're a central bank. It's just too tethered to industrial processes. But if you're an institution or a private investor, [silver](https://www.kitco.com/charts/silver) has been the attractively cheap little brother in the precious metals,” he said. “ The U.S. dollar doesn’t bedrock foundational trust that it once did so investors are turning to alternative real assets.”

Paul Williams, Managing Director at Solomon Global, said that he sees silver’s momentum continuing to be driven by sustained industrial demand, rising retail investor interest (and FOMO), safe-haven appeal, and an increasing structural supply deficit.

“With [gold](https://www.kitco.com/charts/gold) priced out of reach for many, silver has emerged as an accessible way to gain exposure to the precious metals boom,” he said. “Looking ahead, $120 is a potential target in 2026 as the factors that have contributed to this rally are likely to continue. Silver’s safe-haven appeal shows no sign of fading as geopolitical tensions continue. We would not expect the supply deficit to ease much, if at all, as green technologies such as solar and EVs, alongside AI, are continuing to drive demand for the metal.”",1,1769288895.0,MasterPenny,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: Amethyst: How I Got My Name

Hi, my name is Amethyst Walker. My parents, Jessie & Gemma Walker, are the Betas of Alpha Alaric Conrad of the Wildfire Pack.

According to my parents, when I was born, like any other pup. I was only three days old, a tiny pup in a world of powerful shifters, and I was crying harder than any three-day-old should.

It was a searing pain behind my eyes, a pressure that felt like the world was pushing inward.

 ""It's okay, little one,"" my mother, Gemma, whispered, her voice tight with worry as she dabbed my forehead with a cool cloth. My father, Jessie, stood by the crib, his strong hand gripping the wooden rail, his beta strength useless against whatever was afflicting his daughter.

The pack doctor, an older she-wolf named Elara who smelled of herbs and pine, leaned in closer. ""Her fever is rising, Alpha,"" she reported to Alaric Conrad, the pack leader, who was observing from the doorway with a concerned frown. ""I've never seen anything like it. No traditional remedies are working.""

The pain wasn't just a fever; it was like a fire was burning inside my head, specifically behind my eyes. I squeezed them shut, a high-pitched whine escaping my throat.

""Gemma,"" my father's voice cracked. ""Her eyes...""

I opened my eyes, and the world swam in a painful, overwhelming light. Elara gasped, stumbling back a step. The Alpha's eyebrows shot up.

""By the Goddess,"" Elara breathed, her hands covering her mouth. ""They're... they're purple.""

My mother rushed to hold me, and I felt a strange shift, a cooling sensation that seemed to originate from within my eyes. The pain subsided almost instantly, leaving behind a dull ache and a profound exhaustion. I blinked, and the light seemed softer now, the world around me tinged with a faint, iridescent glow.

The Alpha, Alaric, approached the crib slowly, his powerful aura filling the room. He looked into my newly opened eyes, a complex mix of awe and trepidation on his face.

""Amethyst,"" he murmured, the name rolling off his tongue with a weight that felt ancient and predestined. ""A rare and precious stone, and the color of her eyes.""

My parents looked at each other, the fear in their eyes momentarily replaced by a shared wonder. They had been struggling for days to name me, unable to settle on anything that felt right. But now, it was as if the moon goddess herself had provided it.

And so, Amethyst became my name. It was a name that carried the weight of the inexplicable, a constant reminder of the day my eyes changed, and the mystery of whom, or what, I was destined to become, only the Moon Goddess knows. And Sable and I know it won't be revealed to us until she is ready.

The Aftermath and Whispers

The pack doctor, Elara, quickly recovered her composure, though her hands still trembled as she conducted a final examination. The fever was gone, her temperature perfectly normal, and the pain had vanished as if it had been a nightmare. But my eyes remained the impossible shade of purple—the color of a flawless amethyst stone.

The Alpha, Alaric, gave my parents a firm yet reassuring look. ""This is not a curse,"" he declared, his voice carrying the authority that demanded belief. ""This is a sign. The Wildfire Pack will protect its own. Elara, you will say nothing of the color to anyone outside this room. Jessie, Gemma, this is a secret, for now.""

My parents, relieved that their Alpha was not casting them out in fear, nodded in unison. Yet, even as they agreed, the secret began to ripple outward. The pack doctor, despite her promise, couldn't completely silence the curiosity sparked by my mysterious illness. Within weeks, hushed whispers began to circulate through the Wildfire Pack territory.

Alpha’s Favor: Some saw my survival and unique trait as a mark of the Moon Goddess's favor, a future pack healer or even a Luna (Alpha's mate).

The Omen: Others, the older and more superstitious, muttered about a bad omen, a pup touched by something unnatural, possibly a rogue spirit or an ancestral curse.

The Eyes: No one ever spoke openly of the purple, but the name ""Amethyst"" was enough to keep the mystery alive. They spoke of the intensity of my gaze, the way I seemed to look through them, even as an infant. They thought of me as a freak of nature.

My parents kept me close, a precious, fragile secret. My father, Jessie, a Beta known for his steady temperament, became fiercely protective, his eyes constantly scanning for the slightest sign of fear or suspicion directed at his daughter. My mother, Gemma, spent hours rocking me, her own wolf senses straining to detect any change, any return of the burning pain. But there was only the quiet wonder of my amethyst eyes, gazing back at her with the deep, mysterious color of twilight.

That day, the day my name was forged in pain and wonder, marked the beginning of my solitary life. I was Amethyst, the daughter of Betas, the pup with the impossible eyes, living under the careful shield of an Alpha's decree. The Wildfire Pack was my home, but my secret ensured I was never truly one of them. I was destined for something greater, something special made by the Moon Goddess, a path that lay hidden in the depths of my own purple gaze. 

The Silent Years and the Fateful Eighteenth 

Twelve years passed under the watchful, nervous eyes of the Wildfire Pack. I became a master of camouflage, perfecting the art of being just the Beta's daughter. The purple light incident was a shadow I kept locked away. I excelled in pack school, was dutiful in my chores, and was always the last one picked for any team sport—a testament to my successful, albeit painful, strategy of being forgettable.

Alpha Alaric’s protection was not purely altruistic. He wasn't preparing a pawn for an outside force, but for an internal succession. He had a son, Desmond, who was already showing signs of being a powerful, dominant Alpha—a natural leader, beloved by the pack.

The great ambition of Alpha Alaric was to secure his lineage, and he held a desperate, secret hope: that my unique strength, the power of the Amethyst Wolf, would be a gift to his son. He believed that I was destined to be Desmond’s fated mate and, therefore, the future Luna of the Wildfire Pack. My special qualities would strengthen the next generation and ensure the pack's dominance.

The plan was simple: when I turned eighteen and was ready to shift, Alpha Alaric would formally present me to his son. He would reveal my hidden destiny, ensuring his son understood the value I brought to the Alpha line.

 

Chapter 2 Finally 18

  (POV) Amethyst

I was woken by an unfamiliar voice. I jumped out of my bed looking for the person. There was no one there. With wide eyes, I asked who was there. “My name is Sable,” my wolf resonated in my mind. I am your wolf Amethyst. I have waited so long to meet you. Sable, I love your name.

 I figured, since I was already awake, I went to the bathroom and took my 

shower. I went to my closet and chose a lavender sundress and sandals.

I put on a little make-up not much, I like just enough to go with my tan complexion, then added some lip gloss to my lips. I could smell the birthday breakfast that mom cooks every year. The scent of pancakes, bacon and eggs. I excitedly walked down to the kitchen where mom was finishing up the eggs. Dad was sitting at the table with his newspaper.

He glances to the side when I walk in and they both yell Happy Birthday!

Ame, that's what everybody calls me. I smiled big and said, Thank you mom and dad, I love you guys so much. Mom asks if I was excited about my shift tonight. I am sure mom, my wolf's name is Sable and I can't wait to see what she looks like. Maybe today I will also meet my mate. Dad huffs and says I'm not ready to lose my baby girl. Mom slaps dad on the shoulder, Oh Jessie stop picking at our daughter. Any mate would be blessed to be with our daughter. She's special. Just how special mom and dad really didn't but would soon learn how special.

The Fate of the Fated

I walked out of our house when I was hit with the sweetest scent, chocolate and cherries, my two favorite desserts. I followed the scent towards the packhouse. Desmond stood, not alone, but flanked by his close friends, his Beta-in-training Jeffery Chadwell, and a group of younger pack members. Standing closest to him, her hand casually resting on his arm, was Seraphina Bradshaw, of the Temptess Pack. She was a picture of conventional grace: the daughter of a powerful allied Gamma, beautiful, charming, and the woman Desmond had already been openly courting—his Chosen Mate. Her presence was a clear challenge to the very idea of a fated bond.

Desmond was everything the pack adored: tall, with thick brown hair, eyes the color of forest emeralds, and an aura that commanded immediate submission. His alpha strength was already palpable, a hot, radiating power.

When our eyes met, the world stuttered. Sable was jumping up and down in my head, then said the word MATE. The air crackled with a powerful, undeniable energy that slammed into my chest. It was the Recognition—the electric, soul-deep certainty that told both our wolves, Desmond and Sable, that we were fated.

I felt a dizzying surge of joy and relief, the end of my isolation finally at hand. I met his eyes, my own violet gaze shining with hope.

Then, the recognition ended as swiftly as it began. Desmond’s face, initially shocked, hardened into an expression of utter revulsion. He physically shook off the bond, stepping away as Seraphina tightened her grip on his arm, her eyes narrowed in triumph.

His voice, already deep and powerful, echoed in the silent room. ""A beta's pup with freakish eyes,"" he sneered, his gaze sweeping over my modest form. ""I feel the bond, yes, but the Goddess is flawed if she thinks this creature is fit to be my Luna. Seraphina is my choice. She brings alliance, dignity, and beauty to the Alpha line.""

He walked closer, his Alpha aura crushing, his emerald eyes boring into my purple ones. ""I, Desmond Conrad, future Alpha of the Wildfire Pack, reject you, Amethyst Walker, as my mate and future Luna. You will not stand beside me.""

The rejection was like being hit by a thunderbolt of icy agony. It wasn't just my human heart that shattered; the howl that ripped from my throat was Sable's, a devastating cry of pain and betrayal that made the wooden frames of the lodge shudder. I fell to my knees, tears of pain and humiliation streaming down my face. My purpose, my destiny, and my secret hope were annihilated in a single, brutal declaration. I spoke the words I, Amethyst Walker daughter of Beta Jessie & Gemma Walker, reject you, the Future Alpha Desmond Conrad, as my future Alpha and mate. Desmond fell to his knees in pain as the mate bond broke. 

This, I realized, was the origin of the regret. It wasn't Desmond's regret, not yet. It was the crushing, defining regret of Amethyst, the wolf who was promised everything and given nothing but shame. I made it back home and walked in, my parents sitting on the couch in the living room. I didn't let the rejection show in front of my parents. Sable is still hurting in my head. I smiled and told mom and dad I was going to go take a nap until it was time to go to the Hollow grounds. That's where all wolves of all ages go to shift for the first time. It's a beautiful place. When the moon shines down on the ground, it's majestic in more ways than can be explained. I spent a lot of my time hiding from the world. 

 

Chapter 3 The Shift, Meet Sable

(POV) Amethyst

My alarm on my phone goes off, it's 11:00 PM, an hour to go before my first shift.

I won't lie I'm scared, they say the first shift is the hardest. Normally, your mate is there to help with the shift, but as you know, Desmond rejected me. I will have to depend on my parents to help ease the pain.

I put on my white gown with nothing underneath it. When we shift, our clothes shred, so we wear a white gown. I fold a dress up neatly to put on after the shift. 

Amethyst, my dad yells it's time to go, baby girl. I walked down the stairs

Hiding my humility of being rejected, I smile even though it's a forced smile. I'm ready to go.

I walked to the Hollow grounds with my parents. Luckily, I'm the only one that is shifting tonight. We get to Hollow grounds and Alpha Alaric and Desmond are standing there. Wow, just my luck, the two people I didn't want to be there were standing there, even though I figured the Alpha would be there. But the look on Desmonds's face showed he didn't want to be there. For some reason Alpha Alaric wanted him there. 

This is going to be one awkward night. Mom and dad lead me to the center of the Hollow Grounds. The moon is shining unusually tonight. The moon is shining with silver and purple hues.

Dad tells me to lie down in the circle. I lie there waiting, then all of a sudden I feel my bones breaking with the most excruciating pain. Tears start to fall as I scream. Mom says to relax and let my wolf have control.

And in less than ten minutes, I shifted, and my wolf, Sable, emerged: a massive, beautiful, snow-white wolf with eyes of luminous violet.

I couldn't believe how big we were. Sable was bigger than an Alpha wolf. 

Everybody was shocked when they saw my wolf. 

Sable how, I'm a Beta. You shouldn't be this big. 

Sable laughed, Silly girl, we are special, very special. The Moon Goddes has chosen us to be as one.

My parents and Alpha Alaric shift with me for my first run. As we ran through the forest, I was so amazed at how sharp my senses had become. I could see things in the forest clearly. I could hear the animals from the smallest to the largest. Hell, I could see and hear the smallest insects that were crawling around the forest ground. My speed was so fast even the Alpha and Desmond couldn't keep up. I believe we ran for an hour or more. That's when mom and dad mindlinked me it was time to turn around and head back to Hollow Grounds. 

Back at Hollow Grounds, how do I shift back to normal? Sable tells me to think about my human body. Even though being naked in front of other wolves is normal, I didn't want Alpha Alaric and Desmond to see my nakedness. I walk behind a tree and Sable gives control back to me, and I shift back to my human body. After I came back to the clearing, I caught something in Alpha's eyes. But little did I know that Alpha Alaric had an evil thought for us.

Sable and I didn't miss the evil twinkle in Desmond and Alpha Alaric's

eyes. I asked Sable what that look could be about. She said she didn't know, but she didn't like it. The look made both of us uncomfortable, but I didn't let it show.

The next morning, the exhaustion of the shift was eclipsed by the finality of the Alpha’s summons. I was eighteen, I had shifted, and I was no longer the Beta's quiet daughter. I was the purple-eyed wolf, Sable, and I was about to be presented to Desmond, the future Alpha of the Wildfire Pack. But little did the Alpha know, Desmond had already rejected me earlier in the day, Nor did he know I had accepted Desmond's rejection.

We headed back towards our home, my body tired and sore from the shift and long run. All I want to do is take a hot shower and climb into my bed. When we reached the house, I walked up the stairs to my room. I get my soft pajama's head to the bathroom, turn the shower on as hot as I can stand and allow the water to relax my bones. I get out of the shower and put on my favorite pajamas, I climb into my bed and let sleep surround me.

 I woke up to the sunlight shining on my bedroom window. And the smell of mom cooking breakfast. I get up and walk to my closet and I pick out a pair of jeans and my Rolling Stones T-shirt. I walk down to the kitchen to see my parents in their morning routine. My parents look up when I walk in and ask me how I was feeling this morning. 

I'm fine, dad, my body is just a little sore. He chuckled and said Yup, the first shift is the hardest, but it will get easier the more you shift. Mom spoke up baby, your wolf Sable is majestically beautiful. I never dreamed your wolf would be white as snow. White wolves are extremely rare.

Then dad tells me Alpha Alaric mind linked him this morning. The Alpha wanted to see me in his office today at noon. Then I remembered that look in his and Desmond's eyes last night after I shifted back to my human form. I left to go to the training fields for my morning warrior training. Even though they don't like me being there, it is mandatory for all wolves to train. After two hours of training, I headed back to the house to get ready to go to Alpha's office. 

Chapter 4 Alaric's Reaction to His Son Rejecting Amethyst

(POV) Alpha Alaric

That night, Alpha Alaric and Desmond walk back to the packhouse in silence.

Alpha Alaric is doing a lot of contemplating about Amethyst's shift. 

He had assumed she was going to be special, but tonight, he realized not only was she special, her wolf, Sable, was bigger than his wolf Thorne, and she was even bigger than Donnis, Desmond's wolf.

When they reached the packhouse, they went to the elevator.

To the Alpha floor. Desmond headed to his room when his father told him he wanted to talk to him in his office. 

Even though Desmon had a feeling about what was going to happen, he also knew he was going to have to tell his dad that Amethyst was his fated mate. The worst part: he was going to have to tell his father that not only did he reject her, but Amethyst accepted the rejection. Even though Donnis was happy with him for the rejection, he knew Donnis wanted to stick his claws up his ass.

Desmond, what is going on with you son? You look like you are about to piss your pants. I don't like that look on your face. Desmond, boy, I know you too well, so tell me what you are hiding from me and whatever it is, I have a feeling it isn't good. So spill it now.

Desmond looks at his dad, I don't know what you mean. I'm not hiding anything from you. I'm just as shocked as you are about Amethyst and her wolf.

I know there hasn't been one around in over a hundred years. 

Desmond, I yell, don't make me use my Alpha command on you, even though you are an Alpha born, my command will still work on you.

So, for your sake, it's best you just spill it now, boy.

Damn, dad OK, I found out this morning that the purple-eyed freak is my mate. Really, that is awesome news Desmond.

I just knew you two were going to be mates. Dad had this smirk on his face. I couldn't understand why he was so happy.

 

Em, dad, I rejected Amethyst as soon as I sensed she was my mate. 

Boy dad, you should have seen the look of pain on her face, especially when Seraphina, Mike and Daniel busted out laughing. It was too damn funny.

""You what, Desmond? "" You severed the bond? What madness possessed you to reject her? This whole time, you were pacing like a caged beast because of Amethyst. I need a clear answer! Did she accept your rejection? If she didn't, you can still reverse it—don't waste a second! ""

Dad, no way in hell will I accept that freak. She isn't Luna material. The pack wouldn't accept her anyway, they all think she's a freak too.

Besides, she accepted the rejection and rejected me back. Besides, Seraphina comes from Gamma blood, which is stronger and sexier than Amethyst. I have chosen Seraphina as my mate and Luna.

And tell me, son, how well did Donnis take, you rejecting his mate. If I know your wolf, which I do. He was probably ready to let his claws out and stick them up your butt. Desmond's eyes flew wide open, his dad said, Yep, I was right. Donnis wasn't happy about it.

And you just decided to make Seraphina your chosen mate. Damn boy, Amethyst's wolf is bigger and stronger. I didn't protect Amethyst for 18 years for nothing. I knew she was special the moment her eyes went from blue to purple when she was 3 days old.

Now I have to come up with damage control and figure out a way to keep her here in our pack. She will be useful with her strength and the powers she receives. She is the key to taking over the other packs. 

I sit down at my desk. I know there will be no sleep for me tonight as I come up with a recon to keep her here. And Desmond, if I don't sleep, neither do you. So, sit your happy little butt down in that chair and help me come up with something.

We have been sitting here for hours. I look at the clock and see it is already two in the morning. Then that's when Desmond spoke up with a great idea.

Dad, I know what we can do, and it gives us both what we want. I get to mark Seraphina as my mate and Luna and still keep Amethyst in the pack. Tell her that the rejection, as painful as it was, was a necessary political measure. Seraphina’s Gamma alliances secure our borders. And it wasn't meant for her to be Luna, but we want to make her the Head Enforcer. 

Wow, about time you used that head of your Desmond. Go get some rest and I will send a link to Jessie to send Amethyst to my office.

And remember I will do all the talking. Make sure all you do is sit there and agree with everything I say. And Desmond, you better pray to the Moon Goddess that it works and keeps Amethyst here. Desmond gets up and leaves the office, and leaves me sitting there. I'm trying to come up with another idea, just in case Desmond's idea doesn't work.

I finally got up and headed towards my bedroom. I have got to get me some sleep, so I can be on high alert for whatever happens tomorrow with Amethyst.

Chapter 5 The New Game Part 1 - The Alpha’s Proposition

 (POV Amethyst)

The exhaustion from the shift had faded into a dull, agonizing ache, the physical manifestation of the broken bond and Sable’s relentless, wounded fury. I stood before Alpha Alaric in his office, the heavy oak and framed maps of Wildfire Pack territory feeling less like a home and more like a cage.

Desmond was there, too. He stood slightly behind his father, his usual arrogant posture replaced by a stiff, wary tension. His emerald eyes, usually so commanding, flickered towards me with a mixture of confusion and something that looked dangerously close to fear. The sight of him, still radiating the scent of chocolate and cherry, made Sable snarl deep in my mind.

“Kill him,” Sable hissed, her wolf voice a low, rumbling vibration in my skull. “He hurt us. He insulted the Moon Goddess.”

I pushed Sable’s fury down, reminding her: “Not yet. We need to know the depth of their greed.”

Alpha Alaric, sitting behind his desk, didn't offer a chair. His gaze, however, held no scorn. It was pure, calculating greed.

“Amethyst,” he began, his voice surprisingly gentle, the kind he used when addressing visiting dignitaries. “You have shifted. Your strength… it is undeniable.” He paused, letting the silence emphasize the truth: Sable was magnificent, a power he had clearly underestimated. “I have been protecting a secret, a legacy, all these years. And last night, we all saw why.”

He leaned forward, placing his hands flat on the desk. “The rejection, as painful as it was, was a necessary political measure. Seraphina’s Gamma alliances secure our borders. But you, Amethyst, you secure our power.”

Desmond shifted uncomfortably, but his father silenced him with a glance.

“You are not destined to be a Luna,” Alaric continued, the lie smooth and practiced. “You are destined for something far greater. You are the Amethyst Wolf, the pinnacle of our defense.”

He stood and gestured to a map on the wall, marking the edges of their borders. “The Wildfire Pack needs a guardian of your strength, a War Leader who can command our defenses. I am offering you a place of honor and immense power: the position of Desmond’s Head Enforcer.”

The words hung in the air: Head Enforcer. A position of frightening authority, yet one that put me firmly under Desmond's command. I would be his sword, his weapon, forever standing two steps behind the throne he had denied me.

They want to put a leash on us, Sable growled. They want to use us.

Alaric mistook my silence for contemplation. “You will train the warriors. You will lead patrols. You will protect the very pack that houses the future Alpha.” He smiled, expecting me to fall to my knees in gratitude.

The searing pain of the rejection was still a fresh wound, but now it was hardening into a cold, unbreakable steel. I saw the trap: stay here, and my power would be slowly chipped away, forced to serve the man who humiliated me. Be his weapon, and I would never be my own.

I raised my chin, meeting Alaric’s greedy gaze, then shifting my eyes to Desmond, who watched me with cautious curiosity.

“I understand the offer, Alpha Alaric,” I said, my voice steady, betraying none of the chaos churning inside me. “You want to secure your borders and ensure the Wildfire Pack’s dominance.”

Alaric nodded, pleased. “Exactly.”

“And you want to ensure that the power of the Amethyst Wolf—a power you did not create and do not understand—remains under your command.” I let the accusation hang in the air. A power I don't understand yet, I silently thought.

Desmond took a sharp, audible breath. Alaric’s smile vanished.

“I cannot accept the role of Head Enforcer,” I stated, my purple eyes locking onto Desmond. “You do not see me as worthy of being your mate, Future Alpha Desmond. Therefore, I will not stand as your subordinate. I will not be your weapon.”

A wave of Alpha dominance rolled off Alaric, a desperate attempt to force submission. The pressure was intense, but Sable was larger than any Alpha he had ever faced. We stood firm.

“If I am a tool of power, then that power belongs only to me,” I finished, taking one step back toward the door. My life in the Wildfire Pack ended when the mate bond was severed. I will not be caged. Alaric’s face was dark with fury and disbelief. “You dare defy the Alpha decree? You will be cast out, Amethyst. You will be a rogue!”

“I am already a rogue in my heart, Alpha,” I countered, offering a tiny, genuine smile—a smile of freedom. “And my wolf is too big to fit in your pack.”

Without waiting for their threat or their rejection to be formally issued, I turned and walked out, leaving the stunned Alpha and the conflicted Future Alpha in a silence that felt heavier than any decree.

I walked home in a furious state. Sable told me that whatever our power is meant to be, the Moon Goddess will let us know when she is ready.

And we will be waiting.

 

Chapter 6 The New Game Part 2

 (POV Desmond)

I left my dad's office and I can't believe the way he was acting. How was I supposed to know that's why he was protecting the freak.

Donnis growls in my head, don't call mate a freak. They are beautiful. Shut up Donnis. I did the right thing by rejecting Amethyst. You didn't know that they were special either.

I knew Amethyst was living a protected life. I just thought it was because she was the freak child of the Betas. Growing up, we all made fun of her because she had purple eyes. Don't get me wrong, she was beautiful, but with those eyes that made her a freak. Don't call mate a freak, growls Donnis again.

Get over yourself, Donnis, she is a nobody and never will be our mate. I have chosen Seraphina Hodges as our mate and Luna. I know Donnis doesn't like Seraphina. Why does he dislike her, only he knows. She is a better fit for a Luna, not to mention a great roll in the hay.

So quit your whining, Donnis growls and seeps further into the back of my mind and I put up my block, so I don't have listen to his whining and deal with his bs.

I was so glad that I finally came up with an idea that would shut my father up. Sometimes I swear he's worse than Donnis or a toddler. Do I want to be near Amethyst? Hell no. But at least this way, I get to be with Seraphina and my dad gets what he wants, by keeping that freak around the pack. I don't care as long as I don't have to deal with the hag. 

When I opened the door to my bedroom, Seraphina was lying on my bed looking sexy as always. She's wearing my favorite lacy bra and panties. With just one look, I'm as hard as sh\*t. And I can't wait to be inside her releasing my stress.

 I didn't think you would ever get back. What was so important that your dad had you in his office for so long? Seraphina asked. 

I told her that dad was wanting me to take the rejection back and accept Amethyst as my mate. Seraphina's eyes turned red, and I knew her wolf Sandra was on the surface. Hold on babe, I told dad that she accepted the rejection and I have taken you as my chosen mate and Luna. She sighed with relief,

I recounted every word that went on between me and my dad. She wasn't thrilled, but she knew we needed to keep Amethyst tied to the pack. Seraphina made it clear she would keep an eye on the freak. She didn't trust Amethyst. To Seraphina even though she heard Amethyst accept the rejection, she's still worried my dad will make me take Amethyst as my mate. What dad doesn't know, as much as I love him, I will get rid of him and the freak. I don't know why he won't go ahead and step down. He was supposed to when I turned 18. Now I'm 21 and the old fart hasn't stepped down.

Babe, let's forget about my dad and Amethyst will all her freakiness and enjoy the rest of the night. I needed a release, and she knew what I wanted, as I dropped my pants and I removed her lacy garments. The next hour was filled with the hottest sex, and I forgot all about the mess.

Dad woke me up screaming through the mind link for me to get myself showered and dressed. He had sent a mind link to Beta Jessie, and Amethyst would be in his office in 2 hours. I looked over to Seraphina, she was snoring up a storm. Damn, that's the only draw back to her. That sound is annoying. Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Amethyst's face when dad tells her we want to make her Head Enforcers. 

I get up from my bed and walk to the shower. I didn't take as long to shower and dress. I mean there isn't anything special about this meeting. Amethyst loves her parents more than anything, so I'm pretty sure she will accept the position. Because if she doesn't, dad will more than likely do away with her where she will never be found or seen again. Now I can live with that even more.

After I got dressed, I walked over to the bed and kissed Seraphina on the cheek. I tell her I'm going down to the dining hall to get a quick bite to eat, then head to dad's office to get this farce over with. She tells me good luck, she was going to sleep a little longer. 

I go down to the dining hall, and I am greeted by the pack when I walk in. The first thing I grab is a large cup of coffee because I am going to need it, to keep my nerves calm. I fill my plate with sausage, bacon, eggs and toast. Then I head to the elevator. Press the button to go to dad's office. 

I tell dad good morning and sit down. He tells me to remember to let him do all the talking. For me to speak when he says I can. In other words, he means that I am to sit on my happy ass and just smile and nod.  This is going to be a very long couple of hours, and I mean a long wait.

Chapter 7 The New Game (The Weight of the Secret) Part 3

(POV Amethyst) 

The walk back home was agonizingly slow. The emotional residue of the rejection had been eclipsed by the terrifying exhilaration of defying the Alpha. The looks the pack members were giving me in disgust. Yes, Seraphina had blabbed her mouth about the rejection to everyone. But now, fear was setting in—not for myself, but for my parents and what Alaric could do to them. I pushed open the front door.

Dad and Mom were waiting in the living room, their faces etched with a fear that went beyond the normal worry of a shifter. They had heard the cries of the broken bond. They knew.

Mom rushed to me, pulling me into a fierce embrace. Her scent, usually comforting, was laced with panic. ""Oh, Ame. My little Ame,"" she whispered, her hands running over my body as if checking for wounds.

""Are you alright, baby girl? Did Desmond... did he hurt you?"" my father asked, his Beta aura—usually steady and calm—flickering with suppressed rage.

I gently pulled back, forcing myself to meet their eyes. ""I'm fine, Mom. He rejected the bond yesterday, and I accepted his rejection. He felt the pain, Dad. It's done.""

""The pain will pass, my darling,"" mom murmured, dabbing her eyes. ""But the dishonor... to throw away what the Moon Goddess had given him."" That is so shameful. Doesn't Desmond know, since he was the one to do the rejection, the Moon Goddess would not give him a second chance mate.

""It’s not a dishonor to me, Mom,"" I said firmly. ""It’s freedom."" Desmond knew what he was doing because he wanted Seraphina. She was his girlfriend after all. He had already chosen her for his mate and Luna. Mom, he has known for a long time I was his mate, but that isn't the worst of it.

My parents just looked at me with a strange look in their eyes. At the same time, they both asked what could be worse than a wolf rejecting their fated mate, Amethyst. Mom dad, you might want to sit down for what I am about to tell you. Because it really does get worse from here. And neither of you will be happy with what is happening now.

 Mom and dad sat down on the living room couch and waited for me to start. I took a deep breath. ""You need to know what Alpha Alaric wanted from me next.""

I recounted the meeting: the Alpha’s calculating gaze, his cold lie that the rejection was a political tactic, and his offer for me to be Desmond’s Head Enforcer. What would make Alpha Alaric think that I would want to be around Desmond and Seraphina? The pain of the rejection was enough. I sure as hell don't want to watch them together.

Dad stared at me, with anger in his eyes, his strong hands clenching into fists that trembled visibly. He was usually the rock of the family, but now his control was unraveling. And it worried me seeing my dad like that. The look on mom's face wasn't much calmer than dads.

“That son of a b\*\*tch!” Jesse said, hearing dad talk like that was shocking us both. Dad never used words like that in front of me. I was seeing a part of my dad I didn't know existed. He slammed his fist onto the coffee table, making it splinter. “He used us. Eighteen years of quiet obedience, eighteen years we guarded your secret, believing he was protecting his future Luna—and all the while, he was cultivating a tool for his arrogant boy!”

Mom sank onto the couch, tears tracking clean paths through the worry lines on her face. Her voice was thin, laced with bitter understanding. “He didn’t care that Desmond hurt you. He only cared that your wolf was too powerful to waste. He was offering you a cage with a grand title, Ame, so you could stand guard over the Luna you should have been.”

""He thinks he can harness you,"" Dad muttered, his jaw tight, walking in a tight circle in the small room. ""He saw Sable. He saw her size, and he knew what you could be for his son. He was never protecting you, Ame. He thought he was cultivating a weapon."" Well, not my baby girl. If he doesn't think you are good enough to be a Luna, I'm not going to sit here and watch him use my daughter in any way for his greed.

""I know,"" I replied. ""And I told him no."" But mom, dad he is adamant about keeping me caged here. He's probably on his way now. I need to get away from here, but how? 

Mom and dad agreed with me about getting away from here as soon as possible.

Dad said, you will go to the Diamond Moon Pack. Your Uncle Ethan and Aunt Serena live there. Uncle Ethan and Aunt Serena met when they were at Gamma training. Ethan Walker is my dad's baby brother. He was also best friends with the Alpha of the Diamond Moon Pack and when Uncle Ethan found his mate, who was the daughter of the Beta of Diamond Moon. He decided to move there so he could be with his mate. Yes, normally it is the other way; the she-wolf would move to our pack. But Uncle Ethan didn't want that.

Uncle Ethan and Alpha Alaric didn't get along with each other. That happened when I was still a baby. Why was I never told? I don't know. So he renounced Alpha Alaric and the pack he grew up in and moved to his best friends' pack, the Diamond Moon Pack. 

Dad spoke up and brought me out of my thoughts. Sorry dad, I zoned out for a minute. Now what were you saying to me? No baby girl, I know where your mind went to, but we have to get you out of here and fast.

Dad told me to go get my backpack and just get enough belongings to get me to Diamond Moon. I went upstairs to my room, got my green backpack. I picked out some clothes. I knew I would need some undergarments, so I got them first. I walked to my closet to get some clothes. I picked out five of my favorite shirts and a couple pairs of shorts and jeans. Now, of course, I can't forget my favorite jammies. I neatly folded them in my backpack. As I went to leave, I reached for my favorite picture of us. The picture when we took our family vacation at Hilton Head, South Carolina.

 

I took one more look at my room and walked back downstairs to the kitchen where mom and dad were waiting for me. I could see the sadness in their eyes. Dad walked to me and handed me a burner phone.",1,1769288882.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

From early on, we both knew that eventually he would be moving to a different state because of his job. Before he left, I asked him where we stood and what the plan was for us. He told me he was going to get an apartment so that we could eventually move in together. The plan was to do long distance for about six more months, then I would move there over the summer.

He got the apartment and we even looked at it together. Since this was supposed to be a place we’d eventually share, I gave him some ideas for how we could decorate and what kind of furniture we could get. He completely dismissed my suggestions and instead showed me what he wanted. Everything was black — couch, TV stand, bed frame, coffee table, all of it.

I told him I didn’t like everything being black, but I was open to compromising. He said, “I’ll think about it.” Later, I sent him a few suggestions anyway. He didn’t respond. Then he told me he had ordered the furniture and would show me once it arrived.

When it got there… it was all black.

I felt really hurt. I actually cried after we got off the phone because it felt like my input didn’t matter at all. This is supposedly the place we’re going to live in together, yet I had zero say in anything. I feel like he didn’t consider me in the decision-making process whatsoever.

Oh, come on. You must have been worried, even if just a little.

We're work buddies...

I'm glad to hear that. My arm is well too, if you are interested.

Yeah, I got a few larger injuries after we said goodbye, those are still healing. That's why I'm a bit stiff.

*(Offended)* Ten years older? Oh, F you, Picklock, I still look gorgeous. Just a bit tired and chewed up.

*(Realising)* Ooooooh, you meant the walking stick? It's just temporary. The doctors insisted on putting me to bed, but that's just not my style. Nevermind... I'm getting a bit dizzy, maybe they were right that I shouldn't force myself.

I insisted on making that meeting as official as possible. The mission ended successfully, our cooperation is heading to its end as well... It's a reason to celebrate. And if we make it official, it means... Your employer is paying.

I'm not joking. I picked that restaurant for a reason. I'm going to try all of their expensive desserts. And you should also. We've done a great job, we deserve it. Do you have any ""toys"" on you?

Toys, you know, magical devices and stuff...

Good, I told them I want this meeting to be private.

Because I want to explain to you what really happened through those few weeks. I know you've been fed with scraps of information, I've been trying my hardest to keep my story a secret as long as possible. The whole mission was dependent on it. But now my role has ended, there is nothing more I can do, so it's time to move on. Do you want to hear my story or would you rather live in ignorant bliss?

*(Cheerfully)* Hahaha, I saw that sparkle in your eyes! You may act cool, but you're all ears. Great! But first... Waiter! We'll take two kopi luwak coffees and King Midas' ice cream, for the beginning, please.

Thank you. So, where to start... Does the name Henry Vento sound familiar to you?

Yes, he was the police chief here, twenty or so years ago, maybe more, I don't remember. He and his whole family were murdered by the Lobrone family.

Yes, my family. But the funny thing is, my real family name is... Vento.

No, that's not a coincidence. I'm Henry Vento's youngest child.

Yes, officially I'm dead and buried in my family grave. But the truth is, they never found my body.

Yes, I was there that night. I saw the execution of  my beloved ones. And I was just a child. I was scared, so I tried to escape. They sent a man after me and he caught me, but... What they didn't think of was that he had a kid a bit younger than me, so he just couldn't kill me. Instead, he decided to put his own life at risk and offered me a deal. I was about eight years old, but I think I was rather wise for that age. Or maybe the fear made me extra aware of what is happening and that staying alive at all costs should be my main purpose at the time.

No, he sent me to his childless sister, on the other side of the country. He told her I'm one of the mafia's orphans and for the mafia - he said he killed me and disposed of the body. They didn't have a reason not to believe him, so somehow it worked. Sadly, his sister passed away a few years later, but I was already old enough to look nothing like that scared kid who ran away, so he took me back. 

Yes, he was like a father to me. He raised me alongside his own kid, we were practically siblings.

Yes! The Kiddo! I would say you are smart, but that was just too easy. I hope you understand now my irritation with your choice. Kiddo is my closest family.

No, Francesco isn't with us anymore. He was tortured and murdered by the Milerone family a few years ago. You might try to guess who actually has done that, it's easy too.

Yeah, that was mostly personal. But that was really one of the worst scums I've met in my whole life, and I've met a lot of bad people. I don't feel anything pleasant while killing people but that... That was a relief. I know it was like killing someone in their sleep, but... Nonetheless, I'm happy that the world is free of that lees.

Francesco was a good man, he was just unlucky at the start and too weak to change it. He wasn't born to work for the mafia. With his kind heart he struggled all the time. He didn't deserve that fate.

No, he didn't want to involve us in any mafia stuff. He tried to keep us as far from it as possible. He thought I forgot. But I had a plan. I had a plan since he put me on the train to his sister. I never forgot. One of the most important things my own father taught me was that if you want to get rid of evil, you must aim for the roots. But sometimes it's hard to do it from the outside. So I had to be inside.

I'm not especially proud of the things I have done, but it looks a bit different when you sit in it. Remember what I told you? When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you. Despite my past, at that moment I was just one of them.

Of course I did a lot of bad things. And still - I slept like a baby. Just with a gun under my pillow. But I never lost track of my true purpose. I tried so hard, and it was never enough. I began to think I won't make it on my own. And that is where you came in.

You were not only a perfect tool, not only a perfect opportunity. You were like a sign from the universe, that I'm going in the right direction. How much do you know about my meeting with your supervisors?

Nothing. Right. As it should be. But you were never curious? Why did your organisation suddenly decide to work with some mobster from the street?

*(Disappointed)* Jesus Christ, Picklock... You scare me sometimes. You should think for yourself more often. You really didn't find it suspicious?

Oh God, you are a perfect soldier, aren't you? Just following the orders... You should definitely have someone to look after you. You'll probably get yourself in some trouble someday. Just by accident or because of your unawareness.

Do you really think they will let me do my stuff if I would just sell them some information? It turned out your boss is one of my fathers friends. He remembered me as a kid, so he listened to my story, my plan and gave me a chance. I'm not sure if I would be able to gain so much without his dedication and support.

Yes, it went so well and so perfect from there. But it was not easy to pretend to my boss that we are working only to get rid of the Milerone family. Of course they noticed something was wrong at a certain point, it was inevitable.

No, I think it was my mistake. I trusted the wrong person.

I had a few closest ""family” members involved in the plan. Those who shared my views. Those who wanted to be free of all of this. Alberto, the one who tried to kill you, was one of them...

*(With sadness)* I don't know what happened. Maybe they broke him. Or maybe I was wrong from the beginning. Now I will never know...

It's just... It was the first time I shot a friend. I don't really like to think about it.

What happened when I left? Well... The whole action was already prepared, we just waited for the perfect time, but when I got exposed there was not much time left. I just wanted to handle things in my own way, for the last time.

When I arrived they already knew I'm a traitor. I was so lucky your boss reacted immediately. We wouldn't be talking right now without their support.

Yes, I killed my boss. And a few others on the way. They deserved it, believe me. I shot them, just as they shot my family...

*(Startled)* Yes, in the head. Why are you... Do you have some weird kink or something? You are always strangely interested in which part of the body exactly I shot at my victims. Is it a trauma? Or maybe jealousy?

Why are you blushing? What's wrong with you? I think you should speak with someone about it. Psychiatrist or something...

*(Offended)* I'm stupid? You're stupid! With stupid kinks... 

*(Calmly)* Oh, come on, Picklock, I'm joking. Just teasing you. But, if you are wondering, does it make you special because I shot you in the head - no, it does not. You are special because you are the only one who survived it.

Suddenly changing the topic, huh? Well... There's no rest of the story. That's all. Happy ending. The city is free, all the bad guys are in prison or dead. I finished what my dad started.

Ummm... Yes, I feel good in some way. Maybe rather free, than good. None of those won't bring back my family, nor the lost years. But I feel now I can finally start living. Or find something worth living for.

*(Offended)* No, I'm not going to jail, F you once again. For my merits for this city I was granted a fresh start for me and my people.

Yes, Kiddo. And Bernard. And few ""not as bad as you may think"" people. We will get new identities and move out somewhere far far away from the bad memories. Do you want to come with us?

You didn't misheard. I asked if you wanted to come with us. I spoke with your supervisor, you are not a prisoner, you can leave when you want, and you are entitled to a new identity because of your work. So, it's not as stupid question as it seems.

Why would you want to do that? Well, I asked myself the same question and... I'm not really sure. Maybe you are mad, maybe bored... Maybe you think you have enough adventures for the rest of your life. Maybe you would like to keep an eye on us. Maybe you would miss me. I have no idea what's on your mind.

You don't have to decide now, we still have a few months of trials, but be aware that I will try to convince you in every possible way.

Because I like you, I owe you much and I think it was fate that brought us together.

Of course it could have been anyone, but I wouldn't propose something like that to Charlie.

Nuh-uh-uh, don't say it, just think about it. Later. Now... Here comes the dessert, first of many...

1qlyrjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1qlyrjp/first_time_with_ferric_chloride_lets_try_shinkiro/,"First time with ferric chloride, let's try Shinkiro","Hi all,

This post has actually been months in the making. 

It all started when I made the beginner mistake of doing a patina reset on my Shinkiro with Barkeepers friend. This took off the sandblasted damascus and led me down a long path of attempting to restore the finish. This knife has gone through everything from multiple hour long baths in hot coffee, a hot vinegar etch and several polishing attempts with sandpaper and fingerstones. Safe to say, I have not been kindly treating this knife at all.

Unfortunately my efforts didn't yield the best results and even resulted in taking off some of the kurouchi, so I resigned to building up a patina and keeping the rugged look, which takes us to this before state: 

[Very nice patina and dark etch on the core steel, but damascus has faded away in some spots](https://preview.redd.it/2clh87ejvcfg1.jpg?width=1848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d44140817df3f1e6918cfcae90187f01cd41519)

  
After several months of understanding polishing and exploring JNATs, with the addition of countless hours on KKF to understand damascus etching, I wanted to revisit what I had left off months ago. I also want to thank the kind folks at Zahocho for sharing details on how they refinished the Shinkiro.

My goals for the restoration were the following:

* Recreate the polished damascus as close to the original sandblasted finish. Contrast in the damascus is not a priority.
* Keep the dark etch on the core steel. (This grew on me and I preferred it)
* Preserve as much of the kurouchi and cutting geometry as possible

  
This led to me coming up with the following process:

* Prepare the surface for re-etching by sanding with 1500grit, and cleaning it well with acetone. This removes contaminants that will affect the etch.
* Re-etch the blade with a 1:1 mixture of vinegar and ferric chloride to regain the depth between the carbon and nickel layers. The etching process should avoid dipping the blade to preserve the kurouchi.
* After etching, polish the kireha to up to 3000 grit sandpaper, avoiding the core steel as much as possible. Stones are not an option here for an even finish, as I have not flattened the kireha.
* Further polish with flitz to get the nickel layers as shiny as possible
* To haze up the carbon steel layers, create slurry with uchigumori, then use it with 7000 grit to repolish the kireha.

  
While I was mostly comfortable with the polishing steps, I was totally new to etching with ferric chloride. This is seriously nasty stuff and requires proper handling, storage and disposal. I only resorted to this step because I had lost the depth in my damascus after repeated attempts at refinishing.

The ferric chloride mixture works FAST, and I got a pretty clean etch after 10 minutes:

https://preview.redd.it/7gii5vklycfg1.jpg?width=3768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c030fa6e1cf96e032313825a9b3645cb1d6d2bce

While the etch worked well, I did get some areas of pitting, which I had to take care of in the polishing steps. This was basically my comfort zone and essentially the home stretch. I did go back and forth in the polishing to experiment what worked the best, which is already outlined in my process above.

And voila! The final result:

This turned out a lot better than what I was expecting for a first attempt. The finish itself is misty and can seem like the damascus is hidden at first, but it can pop while hitting certain angles of light. While it's not 100% close to the original finish, I think it's pretty close and I like how the darkened core steel highlights all the cladding islands. It's not perfectly even, so happy to get any advice on how this can be improved!

As a side quest, I also re-etched my Masakage Kumo and my Yorokobi to clean up any scratch marks on the core steel from my past sharpening mistakes. The etch on the Yorokobi was notable, as it instantly removed all the oxides from the copper and added more contrast. It worked so fast I stopped the etch at 10 seconds. Makes sense since ferric chloride is meant to etch copper in circuit boards.

I have had anxiety disorder and agoraphobia for over two decades now. It gets worse and better but I have not been on medicine since I was 19. My anxiety is manageable in my daily life except for agoraphobia. Since 2022 it's been severe enough that I can't leave my neighborhood and cannot take a walk in my neighborhood if it's far from my home, or sit at a coffee shop etc. 

My current issue that I'm going to a psychiatrist for is wisdom tooth surgery 😱 The surgeon only uses local anesthesia and my dentist phobia is even more severe than my agoraphobia and after three failed attempts, two making a U-turn right by the door, I accepted I cannot make it there without some help. 

I'm anxious about medicines in general and want to try the most suitable one for my situation. My SSRI experience is limited to Lexapro and Cipralex and that was 20 years ago. I have never tried benzos or alike. I'm quite petite. I thought of asking for Xanax 0,25 but would it be too mild?

My symptoms are the night before I can't sleep, IBS flare up, my legs literally shake like a seizure from anxiety for a while, nausea. The day of the appointment nausea, lots of dizziness, cold sweats, irritability and panicking. I don't drive, I will take a taxi from and to the dentist. I have to go there by myself. What would you prescribe if I was your patient?

The psychiatrist appointment is very expensive and I finished my antibiotics 2 days ago, it's only a matter of time my toothache returns. I would like to try my best to get the most suitable medicine for my situation and get this tooth removed. :-)",1,1769288399.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I soon learned via local chats that federal agents murdered a man about a block from where I live. I went out to the protest around the site and had to flee around the corner when tear gas was deployed in -15F weather. I had to help pour water into the eyes of a reporter from a national magazine on site. A man walked around with his phone numbers on a notepad showing the crowd. He said he was a lawyer who would represent anyone arrested pro Bono but asked us to not physically engage any law enforcement because then he wouldn't be able to get us out of jail.

I made it back into my apartment via some back alleys. Before that I ran into the coffee shop on the corner. The barista said anyone fleeing was welcome inside now and they'd be locking the door and no law enforcement allowed inside without a valid judicial warrant. But I took the opportunity to flee to my apartment.

In the hours that followed my neighbors brought out water, hand warmers and masks and offered them to anyone on the street who needed them and opened up our doors to non-residents who needed to warm up and flee the gas. Later some of my neighbors went outside and even started offering those items for free from our front stairs. This is despite the fact that the gas was so thick that my eyes and throat got irritated just opening the front door. We stood around and just masked and dressed up and kept it going.

Now the feds have fled the neighborhood, the gas has dissipated and the entirely peaceful protests continue and my building and neighborhood all did our part and kept people safe.

1qlyn8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1qlyn8h/sister_is_unable_to_take_accountability_for/,Sister is unable to take accountability for anything,"Hi everyone, hoping someone can offer some insight. I am 43F and my sister is 48. For the last 25 years I have been the focus of her resentment and hatred. She has always accused me of being the “favourite” and receiving better treatment from my parents. She was always a difficult person growing up; regularly started vicious fights with family members, screamed at people and dabbled with drugs through her teens. She left home at 18 officially and never came back. Since then she has married a wonderful guy who supports her and had 2 healthy sons - now adults and decent young men. She still goes on and on about how she had poor treatment as a kid. She abuses my elderly parents regularly about their short comings and still reminds them how she was dismissed and treated “differently.” When I asked her one day what they actually did that was so bad, she actually couldn’t articulate it and told me I was patronising her. She sends long accusatory text messages to both of them, telling them they are failures as parents and dictating terms if they wish to have a relationship with her. When they follow these terms, the terms are changed again to suit her. Example: she told my 80yo father if he didn’t change how he treats her, then she will no longer have a relationship with him and if he needed to contact her and check in, he should do so via my her husband. My Dad, at a loss, did this very thing as he has fought for a relationship with her for years. When he contacted her husband to check in, my sister then texted him and told him she did not say that and that he should be contacting her direct to have a relationship with her. I’ve seen the texts and they are a total contradiction. She even accused my dad of being “dyslexic” due to him not understanding her demands. No matter what we all do as a family it is never right or enough. We had my Dad’s 80th and organised a family trip together, this was an opportunity for all of us to be together as a family. My brother and I got up one morning to make coffee and she flew out of her room shouting at us to keep the noise down and told us how inconsiderate we were. I responded with “we’re just making coffee and we’re adults. We’re allowed to do that.” She then packed up all her stuff and family after crying and making a scene and left the birthday. She didnt speak to anyone after that. I made an effort to go to her house 3 times uninvited to try to “fix” things and we were kind of on track again, until my daughter’s 5th birthday. I invited her to the party and the morning of she canceled due to having an issue with my mum. It was all about my mum not spending adequate time with her while she was in town. After my daughter’s birthday she again withdrew and started sending everyone texts about what shitty people we all are. I attempted to reconcile by texting and calling, but she refuses to accept any accountability for her actions. Says she’s not included in things, but when she is either makes a scene or doesn’t show up. This is then used against us, accusing us of not including her even though we are trying to. My brother and my sister do not get along, so for my brothers 50th he didn’t invite her. This caused more issues and I knew she would be feeling upset. I sent her a text after the 50th to check in and told her I could imagine how she felt and that I was sad she couldn’t be there. She then abused me and told me I should be advocating on her behalf to the family. It seems anything I do, or how hard I try it is never enough. For years she has told me how entitled I am, how I’m a failure and my parents choose to overlook this. I’m not sure why as I am a single parent with my own house, a full time govt job for the last 23 years and not reliant on anyone. Any mistakes I’ve made in the past are brought up regularly, things such as the breakdown of my marriage. She never contacted me during my pregnancy and made a comment to my mum that “the princess is now having another princess and how can she compete with that.” As though I purposely had a daughter to compete with her 2 sons. I asked her to be maid of honour at my wedding and she basically roasted me during her speech. Guests were shocked. 

My question is, is there any point salvaging this or is it even possible? I’ve suggested to her mediation as a family but she won’t go. She is getting therapy I’m told but I’m not sure the therapist is getting the full story. She claims the therapist has told her this is all the family’s fault and she needs to separate herself from us. She says we all lack empathy and even though my mother has been diagnosed with alzheimers, still continues to tell her what a terrible mother she has been. I can honestly say I can’t remember any poor treatment of my sister as a child. I do remember her getting into trouble more than me and my brother due to her behaviour but it wasn’t ever abusive or nasty on my parents part. If anything I think they were too lenient on her at times… what do I do? Apologies for the long post!",0,1769288170.0,family,1,0.5,False

The creature



Silvia managed to recover once again her own mind control. Each time it happened before, she was unable to contain the horror and ended up screaming and showing fear either trying to escape or attacking the creature in front of her, unsuccessfully, since each time the monster had let her lethargic.

This time she managed to compose herself. She observed the creature carefully. It had full blushed cheeks, pink lips, delicate eyebrows, impossible blue eyes and two little dimples on each side of its mouth when it smiled: those were the same characteristics her little girl had; when the monster made Silvia under its influence, she even confused it with her. Now, fully awakened from the monster’s mind tricks, she realized that it wasn’t her actual daughter, that whatever was chewing sitting on the carpet, with the light blue dress filled with blood wasn’t her lovely daughter, but something else.  
  


“Mommy,” it said pouting, “I’m hungry”

 

Underneath its mouth a piece of gut fell slowly off its small chin. Some of its hair tips had been smeared with blood and acted as brushes on its face leaving red bloody lines here and there. That bloody face confronted her with merciless blue eyes.

 

It all started the morning of October 31^(st): Silvia came out to make breakfast and what she still thought was her daughter said to her:  
  
“Mommy, I’m hungry.”  
  
Silvia responded, with a smile, that she was going to make breakfast and presented every option she could think off, and got rejected each time. Then, the little one said clearly what she wanted to have for breakfast. Silvia first reacted confused, then she wanted to believe she heard incorrectly and turned to see her little girl. When she saw what came out of her mouth, Silvia screamed. When it noticed panic, the monster attacked and took control of her mind.

 

She complied with the gastronomic wimp of her little one and when the girl finished devouring the victim bowels, she said once more:  
  
“Mommy, I’m hungry.”  
“You shouldn’t eat that much,” Silvia responded with caring voice.  
“Just one more, Mommy, it’s Halloween!”  
  
Silvia rolled her eyes dramatically, smiled and went out to collect another kid on a costume.  
  
The same scene, with little variations, repeated throughout the day, until Silvia managed once more to get out of the monster’s control. She knew she had to do something to avoid the nightmare continuing. She managed to hold the tears, swallowed the screams of horror smashing on her throat and even forced herself to smile.

 

“You shouldn’t eat that much, cutie,” Silvia said and mimicked a reprimanding smile. The thing with her daughter’s image returned the smile.  
“Just one more, mommy, please?” It promised while a severed nose fell on the living room carpet.  
“Okay, just one,” Silvia responded and suppressed the disgust she felt. She took the brownies tray from the coffee table.  
  
Silvia lifted the tray to her chest and repeated to herself she couldn’t let the monster realize her state of mind. She suppressed as best she could the anguish she felt by thinking she took eight children to her living room just so a disgusting creature could feed itself. Silvia smiled at the monster and gave her best to express a love she didn’t feel, and to avoid reacting in any way to the sight of the thing, that carved the eye socket of the corpse and then sucked it with some sadness for not finding much flavor.  
  
“I won’t take long, my little girl,” she said in singing voice after rehearsing it separate times in her mind to make sure it would come out natural. She accomplished that effect by imagining that she was just going to the market to get a missing ingredient for her daughter’s lunch.

 

What would become of her daughter? Where could she be? The monster that was ripping a rip from the victim’s body, chewing the remaining meat from it, certainly had done something to her. No. She couldn’t investigate, she needed to escape, put herself in a safe place first, then attack smartly and only then search for her actual daughter.

She first thought of each one of her neighbors, until she got to the man that owned a shotgun. But she thought it was improbable he would lend it to her or that he agreed to use it to rip the head off what seemed to be a little girl. She then considered her ex-husband, but she ruled him out quickly; she needed someone trustworthy that backed her up, and she was sure her ex-husband’s reaction would be to question everything before deciding to act in an entirely opposite way of what was needed. If she talked to the police, would they believe her? What would they say about the fact that she kidnapped eight children that ended up dead?

Her mind worked quickly while controlling each step and gesture. Heel, toe, heel, toe, then searching the keys in the open bag in the little table next to the door…

Maybe her best choice could be to get not one person, but all the help she could get: neighbors, ex-husband. The police officer passing every half hour to take care of trick r’ treaters, the guy that talked to her in the marked and gazed on her ass, the hairdresser that one time caught a thief by herself, and anyone, each known and unknown person willing to help. All of them together will bust in her house and they would see what seemed to be a girl, having a kid for dinner in the living room. Someone would do something, react, attack, anything.

With one hand she held the tray, so it wasn’t easy to take the keys naturally; her hand, when it left the safety of her apron, refused to stop shaking. She looked at the thing again; it used a rib bone to smash the others creating a parody of music. That act made Silvia think of the times when her actual daughter played with the food in a regular lunch. She held again her desperate tears and made herself think of what she would do if she believed the thing to be her actual daughter.

 

“Don’t play with your food,” she scolded in an almost playful way. She congratulated herself on the effort and swallowed the vomit that pooled on her throat.

The thing let the bloody bone and gave her a shameful smile, as if to apologize. Silvia smiled and turned her back on it. She managed for her hand to stop shaking and reaccommodated the tray on her left hand.

Two brownies had the slimy liquid that came shooting out of the last kid when the horrendous creature, with a smile too big, jumped him. She almost heard the poor kid scream again. She stopped the involuntary gasp just as it came out of her mouth, and she looked at the monster. It was fixed on her with its piercing blue eyes. The fear revolved her stomach as her hand reached the doorknob.  
  


“Mommy?” The creature said, too serious.  
“I will be right back, honey,” Silvia announced with a smile, but she couldn’t hold the tears anymore.

She didn’t need keys; she would figure out how to get back in later. She was just steps away from freedom, but then she heard that sound and saw how, from the mouth of the creature, identical to her daughter’s, a green tentacle came out and crawled, resembling a worm, while it kept coming out from the dislocated mouth. Silvia witnessed the trail of green slob that the tentacle left until reaching her leg.

 

“No, honey, don’t, please don’t,” she managed to say before feeling the sting.

    
She didn’t know anymore why she was so upset just seconds ago, she didn’t know why she was feeling so scared. Her lovely daughter finished swallowing the tentacle.

 

“Mommy, I’m hungry,” she insisted and Silvia felt bad for her; her daughter was suffering from hunger, and she lost time being anguish for whatever reason.  
“I won’t be long, honey,” she said with a smile, threw the bloody brownies away, rearranged the remaining ones and crossed the door. She saw a chubby boy, dressed as some kind of monster with eyes popping out of round glasses. The boy looked at her and she extended the tray. “One like that is bound to satisfy her hunger,” she thought cheerfully.  
  
“I have brownies,” Silvia declared in singing voice and the kid did what he could to run towards her.",0,1769287964.0,WritersGroup,2,0.5,False
1qlyjiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Senegal/comments/1qlyjiv/business_starting/,Business starting,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some insight and advice.

I’m interested in opening a small coffee shop/bakery in Senegal, but I don’t want to drain a large portion of my personal savings to do it. I currently have stable, full-time income in the U.S. and would prefer to keep most of my savings intact.

My question is: does Senegal allow business owners to open local bank accounts and take out business loans for startups? How does that process typically work, especially for someone who isn’t Senegalese by nationality?

For context, my husband is Senegalese, but we both currently live and work in the U.S. I’m trying to understand what financing options exist locally (banks, microfinance, partnerships, etc.) and what’s realistic before moving forward.

Any insight from people who’ve opened businesses in Senegal or are familiar with the banking system there would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",2,1769287935.0,Senegal,0,1.0,False

I have the worst college roommate ever. It's so bad that **she's racked up over 10 lease violations**, not including repeats, which I've reported to management. They won't enforce anything besides telling me I have to pay until my space is relet. They won't even investigate the violations or evict her. So now as my roommate's ""final gift,"" **I'm forced to move out.**

Everything got worse after winter break. I bought my own groceries and labeled them because she would commonly eat all of my food and wouldn't even touch anything she bought. The next day she separated everything in the fridge down to the individual ingredients like sauces and butter. I was okay with the organization until later that same day, she had removed all of her laundry supplies and stole the entire Costco size pack of toilet paper. That pack was a Christmas gift from her family, and I had provided all toilet paper and laundry supplies the first semester. She even used more than half of my laundry supplies while I was gone. Keep in mind she doesn't even have detergent, she just has scent beads and dryer sheets. 

After **she blocked my access to basic personal hygiene** and essential cleaning supplies, I informed management that I would be moving out. Today while packing, I confirmed with my mom what she bought for me from our shared registry. Turns out I own nearly everything in the apartment from containers to cleaning supplies, most decor, dish gloves, kitchen trashcan, and every single trash bag in this apartment. My mom also bought a silverware organizer which my roommate threw away because she didn't like. I unfortunately don't have access to this registry anymore because she switched it into a different type of wish list. I did check it and there was a dissection kit on it and I'm really hoping that the plan is not to use that on me lol. 

**My questions for advice:** 

* I've confirmed that she has two things of mine in her room, including a KitchenAid hand towel and at least 2 of my Bath and body Works hand soaps. I am willing to part with them, but should I go in her room and retrieve them?
* How do I make my move as quiet as possible? I have removed my laundry supplies since she's made it clear that we wouldn't be sharing. I also took my unopened flour and sugar from the kitchen because I need them in my new place. I will be taking everything that I have paid for and anything my family members have provided from the registry. 
* Should I pack my room now, but leave items and shared spaces until the day I move or just put everything in my room even though space is tight?
* I plan on leaving a note since she will 100% share it with friends and family. I want to make it clear that I'm moving out because of her. Should I include that I have documentation of every items that's mine so she can't argue or try to press charges? Should I include that I documented the state of the apartment when I left versus when I came back from winter break, including damage to my refurbished antique coffee table. (I know it sounds silly but it took me so long and I was really proud of it.)
* Given the escalation, should I request an escort on the day that I move and then formally get access to her room to retrieve my items? I'm sure campus police have nothing better to do and would love to hear my story as I move. 

Honestly, this is just a part of my story. Living here has been a complete roller coaster. If anyone's interested you can view the stories on my page. Thank you for all of your advice!",2,1769287661.0,collegeadvice,7,0.67,False

The mate is an indigenous element dating back to the times of Caral and Huaca Prieta, used by the indigenous people to prepare a wide variety of infusions with different medicinal herbs.

During the viceroyalty period, the mate became an exclusive and luxurious item, used by the indigenous, Creole, and Spanish elites to prepare their infusions based on the ""yerba mate"" (a type of yerba mate) brought by merchants from the Guarani Reserves of Paraguay.

Spanish artisans began to cover the gourd mate with sheets of silver and gold, adding exclusive designs with Christian and indigenous motifs. They also crafted complementary items such as bombillas (metal straws), kettles, sugar bowls, yerba mate containers, spoons, etc.

With independence, the consumption of mate in Peru declined, being replaced by coffee and tea brought by Italian and English colonists. However, the tradition persisted among Paraguayans, Argentinians, and Uruguayans, becoming their typical beverage.

1qlybqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qlybqa/i_took_a_job_stealing_from_a_mansion_the_owner/,I Took a Job Stealing From a Mansion. The Owner Was Waiting for Me.,"I told myself it wasn’t real stealing.

Not the kind you picture when someone says the word out loud.

This was “recovery.” “reclaiming.” “retrieval.”

That’s what the guy on the burner phone called it, anyway—like changing the label changed what it was.

He didn’t give me a name. I didn’t give him mine. He sent a pin, a time, and a sentence that stuck to the roof of my mouth all day like peanut butter:

“The owners aren’t home. The security is old. Don’t get sentimental.”

I wasn’t sentimental. I was broke.

It was late fall and the air had that damp bite that makes everything smell like wet leaves and cold metal. I parked a few streets away because I’d seen enough true crime to know “right in front” is how you end up in a documentary. I walked the rest of the way with a small backpack, black gloves, and a cheap headlamp I’d tested in my bathroom mirror until it made me look like a raccoon.

The mansion sat back off the road behind a fence that was more for show than function. Wrought iron, ornate curls, a gate that didn’t look locked so much as it looked offended you thought it might be.

The driveway was long and pale, lined with stone planters and little ground lights that were off. No motion sensors. No barking dogs. No cameras tracking me with a tiny red dot.

When I tell you that should have been my first warning, I mean it.

It was too easy. Like walking into a store where every employee is suddenly “in the back.”

The side door was where the guy said it would be—by a breezeway leading to a garage the size of my entire apartment building. The lock was older. Not ancient, just… neglected. You could feel it in the way the keyway accepted the pick like it was tired of pretending.

It clicked open in under a minute.

I stood there in the narrow slice of dark between outside and inside, and I had that brief, stupid thought: If I turn around right now, nothing happens.

But my bank app was a horror story all on its own. So I slipped in and shut the door behind me.

The mansion smelled like expensive wood and something citrusy—cleaning product, maybe. The kind of scent that’s meant to signal wealth the way perfume signals desire. It wasn’t dusty. It wasn’t abandoned.

It was maintained.

The guy had said the owners weren’t home, but the place felt like someone had just walked out ten minutes ago.

I found the hallway he’d described. Marble flooring. A runner rug that looked like it cost more than my car. Framed photos along the walls in heavy frames—artsy, angled shots of people I didn’t recognize laughing over drinks, posed on boats, standing in front of snow-covered mountains.

No kids. No pets.

Just… adults with money and time.

My instructions were simple: office, second floor. Small safe behind a painting. “Blue velvet box” inside it. Take the box. Leave everything else.

That should’ve made it easier, right? A single target. No rummaging, no temptation.

Except as I walked past the open archway to the living room, I saw a display case.

Glass. Lit from inside.

And on a velvet stand, a watch.

Not just any watch. The watch. The kind men post online with their sleeves pulled up and captions like “hard work pays off.” The kind my ex used to send me screenshots of with a laughing emoji like we weren’t arguing about groceries.

I stopped. I shouldn’t have. I know I shouldn’t have. But my brain did that quick, vicious math it always does when I see something valuable:

Sell that and you’re not just surviving. You’re breathing.

I stared at the lock on the display case. Tiny. Simple. Like it was there to keep out curious guests, not someone who showed up with gloves and a headlamp.

I told myself one extra thing didn’t change the crime. Like there’s a moral difference between stealing a box and stealing a box plus a watch.

I popped the case with a quiet click and slid the watch into my pocket.

Then I kept moving, a little faster now, because that’s the thing about stealing—you don’t feel guilty so much as you feel hungry. One bite makes you want another.

The staircase was wide and carpeted, the kind that makes your footsteps disappear. Upstairs, the hallway branched. The office was at the end, double doors with brass handles.

I pushed them open.

The office was dark except for the faint glow of city light coming through tall windows. There was a big desk, a leather chair, shelves full of books people buy to look impressive. In the far corner hung a painting—abstract, expensive-looking, all moody blues and blacks.

Behind that painting, the guy said, was the safe.

I crossed the room and lifted the edge of the frame—

—and the lights came on.

Not one by one. Not flickering.

Full, bright overhead light. Like a stage.

I froze so hard my shoulders ached.

Then the office door behind me clicked.

A lock engaging.

Not a latch settling. A real lock. Mechanical. Final.

My mouth went dry.

I spun and ran to the doors and yanked.

Locked.

I threw my shoulder into them.

Nothing. Not even a rattle. Like the door was part of the wall now.

Behind me, something made a soft sound.

A chair moving.

I turned slowly, and that’s when I saw him.

He was sitting behind the desk like he’d been there the whole time, like I’d walked into his office hours late and interrupted him. Dark clothes. No mask. No dramatic hood. Just… a man, calm as a person waiting for a late delivery.

He looked up from a notebook.

Not angry.

Not excited.

Mildly annoyed.

Like I was a telemarketer.

“Hi,” he said. Then, with the energy of someone clocking in, “Okay. Here we go.”

My throat tightened. “Who are you?”

He sighed, like I’d asked him to explain the concept of gravity.

“I’m the person who owns the house you broke into,” he said. “Or, more accurately, I’m the person who keeps the house you broke into.”

He set the notebook down and laced his fingers together.

“And you,” he added, eyes sweeping over me like he was inspecting a dent in a car, “are underdressed for this. But points for the gloves. It’s always the gloves. People act like wearing gloves makes them invisible.”

My heart was hammering so hard it made my ears ring. I backed away from the desk, eyes darting to windows, to anything.

The windows were tall, but the glass looked thick. The kind that doesn’t shatter when you throw a chair at it. The kind rich people pay for because they don’t like surprises.

“Let me out,” I said.

He blinked once. Slow. “No.”

“I’ll… I’ll leave. I won’t tell anyone. I—”

“Sure,” he said, like I’d offered him a coupon. “And I’ll grow wings and start migrating.”

He leaned forward slightly, elbows on the desk. “How’s your night going? You feeling successful? You get what you came for?”

I didn’t answer.

His eyes flicked to my pocket.

“Ah,” he said. “That’s a yes.”

I felt my stomach drop. I hadn’t made a sound. I hadn’t turned my head. But he knew.

He tapped the notebook with one finger. “Let’s do inventory, since you’re going to pretend you didn’t.”

I stared at him, breathing shallow.

“You came for a velvet box,” he said, as if reading a grocery list. “You also took the watch from the case downstairs. The one you thought was ‘easy.’”

My blood went cold.

He continued, unfazed. “You also pocketed the silver letter opener from the hallway table when you came in. The one shaped like a bird.”

I instinctively touched my bag.

It was there. I hadn’t even remembered grabbing it.

He nodded like he’d expected that. “And you moved the small sculpture on the living room shelf. Didn’t take it, but you moved it. Left fingerprints on the base even with gloves. That’s the fun part. Everyone has a tell.”

“How do you—” I started.

“Know?” he finished. “Because you’re not the first.”

He flipped a page in the notebook like this was a routine he did every week.

“Two weeks ago,” he said, “a guy with a crowbar took a bracelet from the upstairs bathroom. He broke my sink. I didn’t love that. Last month, someone tried for the wine cellar. She got stuck in the pantry for three hours and cried so hard she threw up. The month before that—”

My skin crawled. “Why is this happening?”

“Because someone tells them,” he said simply. “Someone always tells them. People don’t just wake up and decide to play burglar roulette on a mansion in the woods. They get a whisper. A nudge. A little promise.”

He looked at me like I was slow. “You got a whisper.”

“I was hired.”

“Mm-hmm.” He sat back. “And you believed it would be clean. Transactional. You steal, you get paid, you go home. You don’t think about who set the table.”

He watched my face for a beat, then shrugged.

“Anyway,” he said, brightening like the topic had shifted to the weather, “you’re in my office. You’re locked in. You’re going to give me back what you took, and then you’re going to answer a few questions.”

I shook my head. “No.”

His eyebrows lifted. “No?”

“No,” I repeated, because my mouth moved faster than my brain. “I’m leaving.”

He stared at me like I’d just told him I planned to breathe underwater.

Then he reached under the desk.

I flinched hard enough my shoulders tensed, ready for a gun.

What he pulled out wasn’t a gun.

It was a small remote.

He pressed a button.

Somewhere in the room, a speaker clicked on—hidden, clean, built into the walls.

A voice came through it.

Not his.

A recording.

A woman’s voice, strained and trembling.

“Please,” it said. “Please don’t—”

The sound cut off with a sharp click.

My stomach dropped. I felt my skin prickle.

He watched me watch him, expression unreadable.

“That,” he said, “is what ‘no’ sounds like in here.”

I couldn’t speak. My tongue felt glued to my teeth.

He set the remote down gently.

“Now,” he said, “I can do this the patient way or the messy way. And I hate messy. Messy is work.”

I clenched my jaw. “What do you want.”

He smiled. “That’s the first honest thing you’ve said.”

He gestured toward my pocket. “You’re going to put the watch on the desk.”

I didn’t move.

He tilted his head. “Or… you don’t. And I take it off you. Which is harder. Which is messy.”

I stared at him, and I hated that the calmness worked. Hated that my body believed it.

Slowly, with shaking fingers, I pulled the watch out and placed it on the desk.

He nodded. “Good. Now the letter opener.”

I set it down too.

“Great,” he said. “Now the velvet box you came for.”

“I don’t have it.”

“You don’t have it yet. You were about to.” He sighed like I was exhausting him. “Okay. Fine. We’ll do it another way.”

He opened his notebook again. “Tell me who sent you.”

I shook my head.

He waited. Patient.

I realized then the silence in the mansion wasn’t the absence of people.

It was control.

“I don’t know,” I lied. “It was just a number.”

He sighed.

Then he pressed the remote again.

The speaker clicked.

This time it wasn’t a voice.

It was a sound.

A low, wet scraping, followed by a muffled sob, followed by something that sounded like… fingernails dragging on wood.

My stomach rolled.

The sound stopped.

He didn’t look at the speaker. He looked at me. Like he was watching a reaction video.

“I keep receipts,” he said. “Not money receipts. Behavioral receipts.”

“What is that,” I whispered.

He shrugged. “A reminder that you’re in a place where the rules aren’t yours.”

“Who sent you,” he repeated, still flat.

“I don’t know,” I said, and this time it was half true. I didn’t know a name. I didn’t know a face. I knew a voice on a phone and a promise.

His eyes narrowed—not angry. Focused.

He stood and came toward me. This time he didn’t stop halfway.

I backed up until my calves hit the edge of a leather couch I hadn’t noticed before.

“Stop,” I said.

He stopped—not because he respected it, but because he wanted me to notice he stopped.

“I hate when people make this physical,” he said, sounding genuinely inconvenienced. “It’s always such an overreaction.”

Then he moved.

He grabbed my wrist, twisted, and pain tore through me like a bright flash.

I made a noise I’m not proud of. My knees buckled.

He didn’t let go. He guided me down to the floor, like he was kneeling a kid for a photo.

“I’m not breaking it,” he said conversationally. “Not yet. I’m just making it difficult for you to do dumb stuff.”

He released me, and I cradled my wrist against my chest, breathing hard.

He picked up my backpack, unzipped it, and rummaged with the casual familiarity of someone going through their own drawer.

He pulled out my phone.

“No service,” he said, turning it over. Then he looked at me. “Still want to pretend you’re in control?”

“What do you want,” I repeated, smaller.

He smiled. “You already asked. That means you’re learning.”

He walked back behind the desk, set my phone down, and tapped his notebook.

“Do you know what you stole,” he asked, “before tonight?”

I stared at him. “Nothing.”

“Sure you did,” he said. “Not from here. From the area.”

He rattled it off like weather.

“A red scarf from a car on the side of the road. A camera from a campsite. Tools from a garage. Cash from a tip jar. A necklace off a hook.”

My stomach twisted.

“You took the watch because it made you feel like you deserved to breathe,” he said. “Like wearing something expensive would make you a different person.”

My wrist throbbed with every heartbeat.

“And the velvet box?” he added, pointing toward the painting. “Doesn’t matter. That’s just bait. That’s just to get you in the room.”

My blood went cold.

“You’re lying,” I said, but it came out thin.

He stood, slid the painting aside, and knocked once on the safe door.

A soft click answered from inside.

Then the safe opened by itself.

My stomach dropped.

Inside weren’t stacks of cash.

Inside were rows of small velvet boxes—different colors, different sizes—each labeled with tape and a date.

Like evidence.

He pulled out a blue velvet box and held it up without opening it.

“You were hired to steal this,” he said, “because whoever hired you wanted to see if you’d do it.”

He set it on the desk gently.

“Now,” he said, “tell me who sent you.”

“I don’t know,” I whispered.

He sighed dramatically. “God, this is boring. You’re making it boring.”

He picked up my phone again.

It lit up in his hand.

Full bars.

That shouldn’t have been possible, but it was.

He turned it so I could see the contact name on the screen:

HOME

The phone started ringing.

He didn’t answer it right away. He just watched me.

“Go ahead,” he said. “Pick it up.”

I shook my head. “No.”

He answered it himself, put it on speaker, and set it down.

A man’s voice filled the room.

Sarcastic. Familiar. Mildly irritated.

“Did she take it?” the voice asked.

The man at the desk smiled like someone who’d just heard their favorite song.

“She took the watch,” he said into the phone. “And a letter opener. She almost took the box. She’s trying her best.”

A pause.

Then the voice on the phone laughed softly. “Always with the watch.”

My brain refused to line the pieces up because lining them up meant admitting something impossible.

The man looked at me like I was slow.

“Say hi,” he told me.

The phone voice went warmer, intimate in a way that made my skin crawl.

“Hi.”

Same voice.

Because it was him.

Not a helper. Not a client.

Just him, playing both sides like it was a game.

“You hired me,” I said, and my voice shook.

He shrugged. “Yeah.”

“Why?”

He leaned on the desk, casual. “Because you were willing.”

The phone crackled faintly.

“Send her out,” the voice said. “I’m hungry.”

I flinched. “Hungry?”

“Not like that,” the man said, waving a hand like I was being dramatic. “Not teeth. Not blood. Not unless you make it complicated.”

He walked to the office doors and unlocked them with the remote.

The doors swung open.

A hallway beyond—dark now, like the mansion had swallowed its own lights.

Somewhere deeper inside, something moved. Slow footsteps. Patient. A soft drag that could’ve been fabric… or nails.

The man stepped aside and nodded toward the hall.

“Good news,” he said lightly. “You’re not trapped anymore.”

My throat tightened. “You’re letting me go?”

He blinked. “No.”

He smiled, bright and mean.

“I’m letting you run.”

I didn’t remember standing up.

I remember the sound behind me getting closer, like someone strolling through their own home.

I remember my wrist screaming when I pushed off the floor.

And I remember running into the dark hallway of a mansion that suddenly felt enormous, every doorway a mouth, every corner a place something could wait.

Behind me, the man called out, cheerful, like he was waving goodbye.

“Try the front door first,” he said. “It’s always funny.”

The hallway lights snapped off.

Not a dim. Not a fade.

Off.

My headlamp beam cut a thin tunnel through the dark, and the mansion felt wrong in it—too glossy, too quiet, too sure of itself.

I sprinted blind, following memory and panic, trying to picture the layout I’d walked through earlier like it was a map in my head.

A corner. A staircase. The living room archway—

Something moved at the edge of my light, not fully stepping into it. Like it didn’t need to. Like it was content to let me burn energy.

I hit the staircase and took it two steps at a time.

My bad wrist made my balance weird. My fingers tingled. I kept expecting it to give out completely.

At the bottom, I turned too sharp.

My shoulder slammed the wall.

The headlamp beam swung wide, and I caught a flash of the glass display case.

The one I’d opened.

It was shattered now.

Not broken like an accident—shattered like someone had hit it from the inside.

I barely registered it before my foot slid.

My boot came down on a scatter of glass. It skated.

I went down hard.

My knee hit first. My hip. Then my palm—my good hand—caught a slice of something sharp.

But the worst wasn’t my hand.

It was my thigh.

A long, hot line of pain opened up above my knee like someone had drawn a razor across me.

I screamed without meaning to.

Warmth spilled immediately, fast enough that my jeans went heavy and sticky in seconds.

My headlamp rolled and pointed at the ceiling, turning the world into a sick white glare.

I scrambled upright, grabbing my leg.

Blood soaked through my fingers.

Not a little. Not a scrape.

Enough that I felt lightheaded instantly, like my body was already pulling the “hey, this is serious” lever.

From the dark hallway behind me, I heard a sound.

Not footsteps.

A soft, pleased exhale.

Then his voice—close, annoyed, like I’d dropped a plate.

“Oh, for—”

He stepped into my headlamp beam like he’d been following at a leisurely pace the whole time.

He looked down at the blood on my hands, then at the shattered case, then back at me.

His expression wasn’t horror.

It was irritation.

“You know,” he said, “I had that case custom-made.”

I pressed my back to the wall, sliding down, shaking. “Stay away.”

He held up both hands like I was being dramatic in public.

“I’m not going to kill you,” he said. “Don’t flatter yourself.”

He crouched in front of me, eyes flicking to my thigh.

The blood kept coming. I could feel it running down my leg into my sock.

His mouth tightened. “That’s… inconvenient.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded cloth—clean, white, too neat. He pressed it hard to the wound like he’d done this before.

I flinched and tried to push him away with my injured wrist. Pain shot up my arm and I hissed.

He glanced at my wrist like it offended him too. “You’re falling apart.”

“Why are you doing this,” I whispered.

He looked up at me, eyes flat.

“Because you take what isn’t yours,” he said. “Because you tell yourself you’re just doing what you have to. Because you want the world to be soft when you’re desperate.”

He pressed harder on my leg. Stars popped behind my eyes.

Then he leaned in, voice low and dry.

“And because if you bleed out on my floor, it becomes a paperwork situation.”

I stared at him, dizzy. “You’re… taking me… to a hospital?”

He made a face like I’d asked him to spend the weekend with my family.

“Yes,” he said. “Unfortunately.”

He stood, still holding pressure with the cloth, and clicked something on the remote.

Somewhere, a door unlocked with a soft, obedient sound.

“Here’s the deal,” he said, voice brightening like he was laying out house rules. “You’re going to the ER. You’re getting stitches. You’re getting your wrist checked because you’re going to pretend it’s fine and then it’ll be a fun surprise later.”

He looked me over.

“And then,” he added, “you’re going to leave. Because I’m not a monster.”

I laughed—one sharp, broken sound. “You’re not?”

He smiled like I’d finally said something entertaining.

“I’m a correction,” he said.

He hauled me up like I weighed nothing and half-dragged, half-walked me through the mansion. My vision pulsed. The floor seemed to tilt.

The front door opened before we reached it.

Of course it did.

Outside, his car was waiting in the driveway like it had always been there.

He put me in the passenger seat with an efficiency that felt practiced—seat belt clicked, cloth pressed to my leg, my wrist folded into my lap like it was an object that needed to behave.

He slid into the driver’s seat, started the engine, and pulled away without hurry.

I watched the mansion disappear behind the trees.

It didn’t feel like escape.

It felt like being moved to a different room.

The hospital lights were too bright. The waiting room smelled like stale coffee and disinfectant and fear.

He walked me in with one hand at my elbow like a concerned partner.

“Found her on the side of the road,” he told the triage nurse, voice bored but convincing. “Glass. She fell.”

The nurse looked at me. “Is that what happened?”

My throat tightened.

His fingers pressed lightly into my arm—nothing painful, just enough to remind me he could make it painful whenever he wanted.

I swallowed. “Yes.”

He smiled faintly, like I’d done a good job.

They took me back fast because I was bleeding through the cloth.

A doctor asked questions. I answered in short sentences. First name only. No details. No story that could be checked.

They numbed my leg and I stared at the ceiling tiles while they stitched me up, counting staples in the acoustic panels because I needed something to do with my brain besides scream.

My wrist got wrapped too. Not broken, but sprained bad enough that the doctor said “no lifting” and looked at me like I was going to do it anyway.

When it was done, when my thigh was bandaged and my wrist was immobilized and my paperwork was handed over, I looked around for him.

He was sitting in the corner chair of the discharge area, legs crossed, scrolling his phone like he was waiting for a table at a restaurant.

He looked up when he saw me.

“Oh good,” he said. “You’re functional again.”

I tried to stand and my leg screamed. I wobbled.

He stood, caught me by the elbow, steady as a railing.

The nurse smiled at him. “She’s lucky she had you.”

He gave the nurse the kind of smile you give a dog you don’t like.

“Lucky,” he repeated.

We walked out together.

The night air hit my face and I almost cried from the normalness of it.

He opened the car door for me again, then paused.

“Before you go,” he said.

My stomach tightened.

He held out my watch.

Not the mansion watch. Mine. The cheap one I’d worn in.

He dropped it into my hand.

“You didn’t steal this,” he said. “You just forgot it mattered.”

I stared at him, confused.

He leaned in slightly, voice quiet.

“You don’t get to keep things from my house,” he said. “But I’m not taking your time.”

Then he stepped back and waved a hand like he was dismissing me from an appointment.

“Your phone’s in your bag,” he added. “You’ve got service again. Call whoever you need to call. Tell them you fell. Tell them you were stupid. Tell them whatever you want.”

He tilted his head, eyes flat again.

“Just don’t tell them about me,” he said. “Because if you do, I’m going to start inventory.”

My mouth went dry. “Inventory of what.”

He smiled.

“All the little things you’ve taken,” he said. “From anywhere. All the little moments you’ve justified.”

He tapped my bandaged thigh with one finger—light, almost playful—right where the stitches pulled beneath the gauze.

“And I’ll be honest,” he added. “Hospitals are my favorite. Everyone’s already bleeding. No one asks why.”

I stood there shaking, trying not to collapse.

He stepped back toward his car, then stopped like he’d remembered something mildly annoying.

“Oh,” he said. “One more thing.”

He pointed past me, toward the hospital entrance, where a TV played low in the corner of the lobby.

On the screen was the local news.

A headline scrolled under footage of flashing lights in the woods:

HOMEOWNER OFFERS REWARD AFTER STRING OF LOCAL THEFTS

I stared.

He didn’t.

He just opened his car door, slid in, and started the engine.

As he pulled away, he rolled down the window a crack.

“I’ll see you when you get hungry again,” he called, like this was a casual promise between friends.

Then he drove off into the dark, and I realized something that made my stomach turn colder than the night air:

He hadn’t needed to trap me forever.

He just needed to make sure I left with proof that he could.

And now every time my thigh pulls where the stitches are, I remember his voice like it’s stitched in there too—sarcastic, bored, certain—

like I was never the point.

1qly709,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1qly709/uga_ulagalla_sri_lanka_cultural_triangle_base/,"Uga Ulagalla, Sri Lanka - Cultural Triangle Base","Hello Reddit People!

After giving it some thought (and hearing from Alex), I'll be writing separate posts for the hotels that I stayed at in Sri Lanka. I won't go too much into detail on my trip logistics - for that you can read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1qjf6og/how_to_do_sri_lanka_the_luxury_way_trip_report/) or my [Substack](https://luxurytravelerdisptach.substack.com/p/iv-the-cultural-triangle). For context, this was part of a longer trip that included Colombo, Tea Country, Kandy (Santani), and the southern coast. 

My first stop of this trip was the Cultural Triangle - it was technically Colombo, but I was there for less than 24 hours. 

I stayed at Uga Ulagalla during my time in Sri Lanka’s Cultural Triangle, and overall, it worked very well as a base for exploring this part of the country.

**Property and location**

Uga Ulagalla is the first property of the Uga group, a local Sri Lankan hotel brand that is currently expanding itself. It’s located roughly:

* 1.5 hours north of Sigiriya
* south of Anuradhapura’s Buddhist sites
* about an hour from Wilpattu National Park
* And it took us around 4 hours to get from Colombo

Geographically, it’s well positioned if you want to combine cultural sites with a safari day. 

The property itself is very spread out and feels almost like a small village set within rice paddies. The closest comparison that came to mind was something like Four Seasons Chiang Mai or Anantara Chiang Rai. It feels rural and open rather than an overly manicured and resort-like.

Something that I really enjoyed is that unlike some nature-focused hotels where wildlife feels controlled or distant. For example, at [Shinta Mani Wild ](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1n8xgvl/an_honest_review_of_shinta_mani_wild_from_a/)in Cambodia (Reddit review here), you’d see insects or maybe something small, but really, you didn’t see animals passing by in those places, and here it’s actually very common to have peacocks, little monkeys, and even some rodent-like animals just crossing from the lobby to the paths that lead to the rooms. So it felt a bit more immersive in that sense.

Everything is open-air. The main lobby sits above the restaurant, with a small lounge nearby and the main pool close by. 

**Service**

Service here was one of the strongest aspects of the stay when compared to the rest of the hotels. 

While it doesn’t have the immediate “wow” factor of places like Santani or Uga Hallowella, the staff felt extremely well trained. The manager checked in with us regularly and clearly knew our itinerary. The front desk team was organized and proactive.

Golf carts were reliable, even for last-minute requests. Since we were staying in one of the farthest villas, it took about five-seven minutes to reach our room, and we rarely waited more than 10 minutes for a cart, which I think it's reasonable.

**Villas/rooms**

There are three main villa categories and I got to stay in one of the deluxe villas. 

The **standard villas** are typically attached to one another. They include a bedroom and a living room and work well for couples. Extra beds can be added, but space gets tight, and there’s no second bathroom. Privacy can be limited, depending on which unit you’re in.

Villa **#1** is more private than the others, as it doesn't have any neighbours. 

https://reddit.com/link/1qly709/video/go56gb7iycfg1/player

The **deluxe villas** are noticeably more spacious and include a second (smaller) full bathroom. All villas have plunge pools, but the deluxe category offers larger pools and private terraces overlooking the rice fields, with no neighboring villas in sight. \[I highly recommend taking a look at the videos I posted on my [Substack](https://luxurytravelerdisptach.substack.com/p/iv-the-cultural-triangle) as I feel my text-based description doesn't make it justice\]

There’s also a **family villa** option with two bedrooms and a living area, accommodating up to six people. I only saw this from the outside, but it sits directly in front of expansive rice fields and has its own large pool.

One downside: we had a significant bathroom leak, likely due to heavy rain. We only noticed it on our last night and reported it then.

**Activities and nature**

Uga Ulagalla places a strong emphasis on conservation.

They work closely with nearby communities on elephant conservation, including installing low-voltage electric fencing to reduce human-elephant conflict. The property also tracks elephants and other wildlife in the area

https://preview.redd.it/v0tvomsaxcfg1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=b799ffce69f49cf2103c3ba3a2e673fe2ba02d39

One of the highlights was a guided excursion with one of the hotel’s **naturalists** to a nearby village and reservoir. It lasted about two hours and included discussions on village life, conservation efforts, and birdwatching. Even with poor weather, we saw eagles and a variety of birds and a great lunch. 

https://preview.redd.it/ordtr16excfg1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf149c15229c1e87c3d0cddb6860ebdc7f8fc1b

The quality and energy of the naturalist made a big difference. She was also available for Wilpattu safaris, and based on this experience, I’d expect a much stronger outing with her than with a generic park guide.

**Food**

The main restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

Breakfast includes Sri Lankan and Western options, like in the majority of hotels. The Sri Lankan breakfast, largely curries, was excellent and far more interesting than the Western offerings.

Service was generally fast, though one lunch took longer than expected despite the restaurant being quiet. Mornings and evenings were better staffed.

There’s also a small, rustic dining experience set in the middle of the rice fields. At night, you can’t see much of the surroundings, but the setting is intimate, with just a few tables and a simple stone oven. The meal consists of many small dishes, generous to the point of being slightly excessive.

https://preview.redd.it/gjcuuznjxcfg1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=a990e714126436ecf7d1ce2072ce1754cb2a38f8

One point that stood out to me was the lack of plastic bottles and coffee paper cups. However, maybe they could offer some sort of mugs if guests want to have a take away coffee. 

**Things I didn't love: Maintenance & Gym**

They will be closed in May and June 2026 for maintenance work, which should fix the water leaks in my villa. 

The only thing I disliked was the Gym. I'm really not someone who spends time at the gyms during my trip, but on a rainy free afternoon, I wanted to run and my friend wanted to do some simple exercises. To our surprise, the gym was very, very small with antiquated machines, so we ended up leaving after 15 minutes. 

**Who I think this is best for?**

* Couples or families wanting space and nature
* Travelers exploring Sigiriya, Anuradhapura, and Wilpattu
* People who value service, setting, and activities over flashy amenities

Hi peeps

You might have noticed me posting questions here and there in the past couple of weeks.

So here it is. A 72 hours long trip. Mostly for my check up.

I am from West Bengal and to be very honest Hyderabad have been a lovely experience.

Day 1. Started with looking for hotels near Banjara Hills, ended up staying close to it. No fuss, super helpful guy, little bit language issue at first glance. Went to have dinner at Nawaab. Dude the crazy line. 9.20pm went in, queued up to get myself registered, finally 9.40 registration done. To get a table 10.20pm

Even with so much of crowd only the Northies were grunting, and sometimes just trying to rub or rush the other person infront of them. You guys are chill. Never expected a proxy entry could end up in a joke and everyone laughed. Couldn’t be possible in WB without some verbal abuse.

The Nihari and Biriyani made all wait worth it 10/10

Day 2. Check up and all, went to Roastery, something like Kolkata ones but man the Coffee. I would stay there forever for the coffee only. Wholesome experience. And the obnoxiously huge SUVs with cute Volkswagen Beetle spotting.

10/10 

Then my quest to Charminar began, previous night was told by a Rapido Captain to go there have Bun Maska and then to Pista House to have biriyani. And I heard him. I was late, not able to enter the Charminar, but it was a lovely architecture, the crowd made me a bit nervous.

Then went inside Makkah Masjid, offered my evening prayer. Peace.

Bun Maska with Tea (Cha) at a place I dont actually remember the name. It was really nice.

Pista House, Zafrani Mutton biriyani with a huge portion size for one. Not able to order anything else

Solid 8/10, portion wise 10/10

Day 3 

Started the day a little late. Brunch at Rameswaram Cafe. Food 8.5/10

Chowmahalla Palace and another appointment 

Man 150 rupees for entry. Man I was thinking I would be provided the chance to meet some family members of Nizams, guess what I met them 🤣🤣 (meeting at some place, local reporters said Members of the Nizams family are here but due to security you can’t get close to them)

Was craving for some paya and bread, got the recommendation of The Shah Ghouse. Have low spice tolerance. Paya was delicious but too much for me spice wise. I was literally crying at some point. 

Even after all that I would give it a 9/10

Ended my journey next morning with coffee from 3rd Wave. Also very aromatic, a strong hit in the morning. 

Correct me if I had the tourist bias

You guys are generally cool, less brawl on the road. 

Traffic is really chilled. But for god’s sake please wear Helmet and give helmet to your co-passengers.

The large ass Mall size single stores are eye catcher. Will visit on my next. 

Car culture is something to talk about. I don’t know how many millionaires live in Hyderabad but the number of cars worth more than 1 crore will out number Kolkata or WB in toto any day.

Ladies oh Ladies, how gracefully managing the Minibus size suvs or 🛥️ like sedans on traffic like that, something I was admiring everyday.

Roads are pretty much clean, no scums spitting gutkas here and there. No stains. 

Only dried leaves, sands that are bearable to an extent. Some places have nice roads some needs work.

Language is not an issue for someone who doesn’t like to impose Hindi on fellow countrymen. Most of the people I met apart from people who are as literate as me or more was speaking to me in Hindi.

Auto drivers are same breed everywhere. No exceptions.

 Civic sense as per WB standards. Which is sad.

Please stay away from your phone while driving. You guys are addicted to phone like anything.

Also I looked at your per capita income, impressive. 

Lastly but not the least

You guys are horny as hell 🤣🤣",25,1769287112.0,hyderabad,4,0.96,False

I learned a lot from Rian Doris, S Kotler, sports people and basically anywhere because I got obsessed with it.. just from sports, gaming, coding, guitar. 

For me, if I'm passionate about what I'm doing, that's a big trigger. But everyone has their own. Novelty, etc..

But anyways the flow state can be described in a common order of events. 😃😃

1. You struggle, it's hard, you're learning, your brain is adapting, you feel the stress the pain sometimes how tough it is 2. Release from it. Do something completely different to get attention off it. You'd be surprised what the brain does in background (DMN). 3. When ready for the flow state, use some l theanine and coffee (common huberman stack). Start the work 20 mins after because the effects will peak during the session. And happy flow state. 4. So however long you decide to spend in that amazing state. Do some recovery. Good food, nutrients, sauna, whatever just get body repairing so brain can fully be happy and learn everything from the process.

I’m interested in learning what tools or general workflows artists tend to use for this kind of stylized character work — not trying to recreate this exact character, just understand the broader approach.

Is this typically done in Blender or C4D?  
Do people use character generators, auto-rigging tools, or AI-assisted workflows for motion?

Would love any insight from folks who work in stylized character animation.

# Beyond the Drive-Thru: Rethinking Your Morning Coffee

There's a fundamental quest for that first cup of coffee each morning. For many, it's about the jolt, a quick fix from the nearest drive-thru.

It’s about the steam rising, the rich aroma filling the kitchen, and that first, nuanced sip that truly awakens the senses.

In that time, things have been great; he treats me like a queen and I know he adores me, however, there has been one thing that has consistently been a problem in our relationship- he doesn’t remember anything I tell him. For example, he had an appointment on Friday at 4:30 for his primary care check up, and he had an appointment today, Saturday at 11:30 for Social Security. I’ve reminded him of these appointments every day for the past week. The day of his primary care check up around 3:00 PM I said, “hey are you ready ?” to which he replied “for ?”. I reminded him, “The doctor…” and he was like “oh yeah oh yeah”. then, while we were on the way to the doctors he said,  “what is this for, Social Security?”. I reminded him every day this past week of both of his appointments and what they were for. I thought he wouldn’t remember either one but I tried anyways. Today, the day after his primary care appointment and of his Social Security appointment, he asked me if we had anything going on. I was not thinking and replied “no, I don’t think so” so we ended up sleeping through his 11:30 appointment. At 12pm I realized what had happened and said, “oh no what time is it?!” and realized it was already too late. This man really said “what was that for? I literally asked you if we had anything going on today?!” that’s when I said “~~his name~~, I was half asleep when you asked me. I’ve told you about this appointment so many times you should’ve been able to remember it on your own.” And he just said, “oh”. About 30 min passed and I was like “I really want some cereal, dammit we’re out of milk. I know I bought our roommate couple a gallon of milk (they asked for me to get them a gallon bc I borrowed a lot of their previous gallon of milk) so let me ask them if I can use some to make cereal.” I then thought to myself about how he had made us coffee this morning and realized he more than likely used their milk after me telling him multiple times about how it was not our milk: He was with me when they asked for the gallon and when I bought it, I told him it was for them then and I reminded him when we were at the house by literally drawing our initials on our gallon of milk so they wouldn’t get mixed up. I put my hand to my forehead and said, “ you used their milk this morning, didn’t you?”. Surprise, surprise- “yeah I did how would I know?” He says. That’s when I got upset and said, “When I tell you things, it literally doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter at all because you never remember like ever! like never not ONCE!” He said, “why are you getting so upset over milk?” I told him it wasn’t about the milk and how it’s about the fact that we’ve been together for five months and in that time, he has seldom remembered anything that I have told him about. There are so many examples, but this is just the most recent. I literally don’t know what to do. This has been a problem for so long and he claims it’s because he has a terrible memory, but I really think it’s because he’s got selective memory and there are no consequences for him not remembering because I always take care of things. Again, I have to reiterate, he’s amazing and will do anything for me- I’ve never been treated better and have been so in love- but this is driving me crazy and I don’t know how to fix it or where to start. Please if anyone has any advice or any input- I would be grateful.

TL;DR

My bf of 6 months (37 m) and I (25 f) are at an impasse. He's amazing and I love him and he would do anything for me BUT he doesn't remember anything that I tell him. It doesn't matter if it's about an appointment or if it's about knowing which stuff is our roommates and what is ours- he doesn't remember either way.

1qly197,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qly197,My system - final or not?,"Hi there,

My current system is:

* Klipsch Heresy 3
* McIntosh MA 352
* WiiM Ultra Streamer

I just upgraded the amp as I needed the McIntosh MA 352 for the brand, looks and having my personal end-game amp that can stay forever. Absolutely love it.

I like the sound signature and looks of the Heresy 3 and do not find them sounding harsh at all. The bass is obviously lacking but got much better with the MA 352 as well as sound stage and separation. I had a NAD 326 BEE before.

Could I have gotten with the 8k$ upgrade a better sounding system than mine currently? Definitely, yes, but I do not regret anything.

I also got Meze 109 Pro headphones for most listening in the evening.

The current listening room is less than ideal but we are probably moving in a year or so. The room is therefore no real consideration.

A big point for the system is size and optics. I would like to move the system to the living room and use also with a TV for movies (stereo) at our next place. My wife is not a big fan of visible audio equipment but can live with the Heresy.

My question is whether I should bother with adding a subwoofer and getting the maximum out of what I have - or do a complete reset of speakers?

While I enjoy the system, especially with the new amp, I really would like more.

I think subwoofers would do a lot for the sound at a reasonable price but ultimately I may feel the itch to upgrade the speakers anyway. And my wive will definitely hate subwoofers. Maybe I can hide a SVS Micro 3000 or KEF KC62 somewhere. Or get away with a REL classic saying it’s a coffee table.

I listened to a few speakers recently but plan to listen to many more when I get the chance.

* B&W 802 were amazing with the right song but too annoying for me with some other music. Like „I want to cut off my ears“ .. That’s nothing I could tolerate.
* Monitor Audio Platinum big towers were intriguing with amazing highs but maybe nothing I would like for everyday. Jimi Hendrix was somewhere between beautiful, breathtaking and cruel, but definitely moving.
* Out of nowhere the Wharfedale Lintons were my favorite speaker out of these three. Different sound signature compared to the Heresy but lovely for every song and genre. Could sound slightly more separating and bigger. Maybe the British Monitor theme is something to explore further with Harbeth and the like.

I am intrigued by the Sonus Faber Olympica Nova line but did not have the chance to see or hear them.

Staying with Klipsch, I do not see the larger Heritage models to fit into our interior design really. Maybe a Forte 4 but it seems a bit dull as I like the angled shape of the Heresy.

I could afford maybe 10-20k$ and think that’s what I need to really move ahead of the Heresy… but am not sure if I am willing really. I would need a major WOW for this. Many speakers just sound different but not universally better with everything. I listen to all genres.

Curious to hear some opinions. I am not asking for specific shopping advice but rather wondering on the strategic direction:

Stay put, look for end-game speakers, or try to fix the current system?",43,1769286783.0,audiophile,26,0.96,False

1qlxyp7,https://i.redd.it/bbrboj2gxcfg1.png,Supernumerary (Part One of a Slow-Burn Psychological and Body Horror Story),"Sheila stood in front of her bathroom mirror, the fluorescent light flickering with a high-frequency hum that seemed to vibrate against her entire being. She hooked her index finger under her upper lip and pulled. There it was. A new tooth, perfectly formed, stacked neatly atop her central incisor.

What had initially felt like a strange bump in her upper gums had now revealed itself to be a fully formed tooth, comparable in size to the tooth it was directly above. She was thirty-five years old. Her dental development should have been a closed book for over a decade.

“We’re matching!” squeaked a tiny voice. Her five-year-old son, Finn, was tugging at his own lip. A similar protrusion was visible in his small, pink mouth.

“That’s your grown-up tooth,” Sheila said. “Means you’re getting big.”

Her son grinned, then frowned thoughtfully and pointed again. “Are you getting big, too?”

Sheila giggled and rubbed Finn’s curly hair.

Reluctantly, she booked a dentist appointment for Monday.

The week was a slow-motion car crash of condescension and rising pressure. At the office, her boss, a man named Miller who smelled of expensive coffee and stale ambition, leaned over her desk.

“Sheila, these reports are… incomplete. I’m unable to present these to the board. You seem distracted.”

She stared at his mouth while he spoke. She found herself counting his teeth. Thirty-two. A standard, boring set. She felt a surge of irrational, jagged hatred. She wanted to reach across the mahogany desk and rip the precision out of his jaw.

She felt the new tooth click against her upper lip. It was sharp.

At school, Finn stood near the chain-link fence, his back to the brick wall of the gymnasium, as he watched his classmates running around. The other boys didn’t let him play football anymore. His face, once soft and symmetrical, had become a topography of hard ridges and asymmetrical swells.

Suddenly, the football flew through the air and landed hard on Finn’s nose. It stung, but he tried to play it off with a nervous laugh. The boys just stared at him.

""My dad says your face is melting,"" Leo said. He leaned in, peering at the way Finn’s jaw pushed outward at an unnatural angle. ""He says you’re a freak.""

Finn felt a lump in his throat and fought to hold back his tears.

Before the drive home, the world felt too bright. Finn was zoned out, in his own world. Something Sheila usually found charming. Today, it felt like a personal affront.

“Get in the car, Finn. Now,” she barked.

“But I found a rock that looks like—”

“I don't care about the fucking rock!”

The silence in the tiny Chevrolet was thick and uncomfortable. At dinner, when he pushed a piece of broccoli away, she snapped. She stood up, her chair screeching against the linoleum. She shouted until her throat felt raw, until Finn shrank into his seat and sobbed uncontrollably.

Monday. Dr. Tresham’s office. The smell of clove oil and latex reminded her of a funeral home.

“How strange,” muttered Dr. Tresham as he adjusted the overhead light. The heat of the bulb radiated against Sheila’s forehead. “The eruption speed is—”

“Can you remove it?” Sheila’s words were clipped.

“We’ll need a map first. An X-ray to see the root structure. We don’t want to damage the original incisor.”

“So it’s serious?”

“I don’t think so, no,” Tresham offered a smile intended to be reassuring. It wasn't. “Just a rare adult supernumerary. Nothing we can’t handle.”

Sheila left the office with a prescription for ibuprofen and a sense of impending structural failure.

The weekend was a descent.

By Friday night, the pain had progressed from a dull ache to a rhythmic pounding, like a hammer striking an anvil inside her jawbone. She retreated to the bathroom, locked the door, and gripped the edge of the porcelain sink.

Knock. Knock.

The sound vibrated through her skull, amplified by the new bone. It felt like a chisel hitting a nerve.

""Mummy? Are you crying?""

It was Finn. His muffled voice was filtered through the wooden door.

""I’m fine, Finn."" Her words were thick.

""I have my doctor kit,"" he said. The handle rattled. He was trying to help. ""I can give you a check-up. I have the special light!""

Sheila squeezed the porcelain until her knuckles turned the colour of the bathroom tile. The ibuprofen sat unopened on the counter.

""Finn. Leave. Me. Alone.""

""Is your tooth hurting you?"" he persisted. His tone was innocent, ""I can fix it. I’ll be the dentist.""

Sheila yanked the door open. The sudden movement sent a spike of agony through her jaw that felt like a lightning strike. Finn jerked backwards, wide-eyed.

""Shut up!"" she roared. The sound was a wet, grinding snarl.

Finn’s plastic stethoscope clattered to the floor. He stared at her. Not at her eyes, but at her mouth. Her lip had snagged on the new incisor, drawing a thin, bright line of blood.

""You're... you're bleeding."" He whispered.

The anger evaporated, replaced by a cold, metabolic shame.

""Go to your room,"" she managed, her voice a dry rattle.

She closed the door and locked it again. Behind her lower front teeth, two more slivers of white had breached the surface.",3,1769286615.0,bodyhorror,1,1.0,False

He told her this once, early on, and now, when she comes into his room in the morning, which happens every morning, she asks specifically, “Was I the first person you talked to today?”

“Yes,” he says and then offers some approximation of, “I left for work this morning before anyone else in my house was awake. Even the dog. You’re the first person I’ve interacted with.”

“Yay!” she says.

“I know. It sets a good tone for my day. I’m glad it’s not someone I like less,” he says.

“Okay, so, Mr. Asher,” she says, “listen to this…”

Mr. Asher pulls into the school parking lot between 7:15 and 7:20. He is one of the first teachers to arrive, yet he’s never as early as the math teacher, Mr. Mallory, or Madame Maitland, the French teacher. By the time Mr. Asher backs into his regular parking space–the third spot in the first row abutting a small grassy hill–retrieves his leather satchel from his back seat and his insulated coffee tumbler from the front center console, makes the short walk up to his building, and unlocks and enters his first floor classroom, room 118, it’s nearly 7:30, and he has exactly half an hour to ease into the morning before first period English 9.

By 7:35, Anna is there. The first thing she does is grab one of the dry-erase markers from the whiteboard ledge and start writing on the board. Sometimes she writes “Anna was here” or “I love Julie,” Julie being a student in Mr. Asher’s first-period class, or even “Mr. Asher is the GOAT.” Some days, when Mr. Asher has a new set of markers, she performs a *marker rating* on the board, testing each specimen’s strength and vibrancy: “purple = 80%, blue = 30%, red = 40%, etc.” Often, she draws pictures of assorted cartoon or anime characters, unfamiliar to Mr. Asher.

“How are the freshmen this year?” she asks. “Are they as good as we were last year?”

“No. They’re maniacs. It’s like they’ve never been allowed indoors before.”

“Aww.. you miss us.”

“I miss *some* of you.”

By 7:50, she runs off for her first period class somewhere down the hall. “I gotta go,” she says. “I can’t be late for Modern World.” And then, “Okay, bye. Love you!” on her way out the door.

“Okay. Have a good day,” Mr. Asher says, laughing.

One morning, Anna enters looking dejected, and Mr. Asher asks if she’s okay.

“Connor and I are fighting, and I have a chemistry test I didn’t study for. I think I’m just going to kill myself,” she says.

“Well,” Mr. Asher responds, “it’s clear you didn’t arrive at this decision lightly. And you’ve lived a good life. Not a long one but an eventful one. We’ll miss you. People will cry at the assembly.”

This makes her laugh, and she says, “Mr. Asher. You’d be so screwed if I actually did it one of these times.”

Mr. Asher thinks about that for a minute. He says, “I’d have to make it look like a murder to throw suspicion off myself. And then kill a few other 15-year-olds from other schools, so everyone thinks it’s like a local serial killer thing.”

“Wow, you’ve thought about this.”

“Hey, I’d lose my job and teaching license. I’ve got a mortgage to consider. It’s that or follow suit. I mean, I suppose we could meet up in the afterlife for our morning chitchat. The markers never run low there.”

She looks briefly confused and then laughs even harder and says, “Okay, gotta run. Love you.”

The next day, she’s elated and leaps into the room energetically.

“Glad you survived the night,” Mr. Asher says.

“I got my temps!” she announces. “And we already picked out the car I’m getting for my 16th birthday!”

“Lamborghini?” he asks.

She smiles, “We’re not *that* rich, Mr. Asher. It’s a Bronco. A 2025, though.”

“Well, maybe you’ll pass a blue 2018 CR-V on the way in sometime. Just know that its operator is inside listening to audiobooks or talking himself out of suddenly jerking the wheel over the Valley View Bridge.”

“Wow, that’s dark.”

“Yeah, well, driving is deadly serious. Keep your hands at 10 and 2 and your existential crises in check.”

“You’re so weird. Okay. Love you.”

“See you tomorrow.”

And later.

“So, Connor is jealous.”

“Connor is the hockey bro with that haircut they all have?”

“Yes, Mr. Asher, he’s my boyfriend.”

“Okay, so…”

“So, he thinks there’s something going on with Nick.”

“But, there *is* something going on with Nick, right?”

“I mean, we talk online, and he tried to kiss me, but I didn’t really kiss him back.”

“What about Ugly Guy?”

“Well, Ugly Guy…”

“Also, I don’t think he’s ugly, by the way. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with him.”

“No, he’s definitely ugly. But he’s sweet. We texted last night.”

“And Connor is jealous.”

“Yes, should I just break up with him?”

“Nah, just date them all. Ugly Guy too. Who cares? You’re not married. Ain’t no ring on that finger.”

“Mr. Asher.”

“Look. I never claimed to give good advice. I just think you’re very young. They’re young too. You should all just not worry too much about this kind of grown-up relationship stuff yet. You have years before you join the rest of us and enter into your own domestic hellscape.”

“Mr. Asher. Your wife would not like that description.”

“I’m pretty sure I’m quoting her. I’m the optimistic one in our relationship. She’s probably skimming from the savings account and planning her escape.”

Sometimes, he passes her in the hallway on his way to lunch or between classes, and she makes him stop and do their handshake she invented for them. It’s two slaps and a fist bump. She wanted something more elaborate, but he told her he was too old to remember choreography and too uncoordinated. “My dancing days are over and gone,” he said.

He has other kids who visit him throughout the day, too. Imani and Amari also use the markers to leave notes for him and their classmates. Ella keeps him well-versed in varsity softball gossip–*lore*, she calls it–and Landon tries to engage him in politics to no avail. But Anna is his most regular attendee, and whenever she’s sick or late for school, he feels an absence from his daily routine. Not that he’d ever tell her that.

“Mr. Asher,” she says from the doorway one morning.

“Hey,” he says, surprised, “what’s going on?”

She enters the room and sits across from him. “I was watching you from the doorway, and you just looked so sad.”

He looks surprised for a second and then recovers, and, in a deadpan, says, “Well, I was probably thinking that I’ll be waking up to an alarm and driving to work in the dark five days a week for the next 25 years. I mean, that or I’m still nervous that you and Ugly Guy won’t get together. Think about the stories you’d never get to tell your half-ugly grandkids someday.”

“I can never tell if you’re joking,” she says.

“I’m always joking,” he says.

“How’s your life, Mr. Asher?” she asks. “For real. Are you happy? Are things good with your family? With you and your wife.”

He stares at her for a minute and then says, “Yeah, everything’s good. Went out to a nice dinner last night, came home and watched some TV, had a cocktail, in bed by 10.”

“Oh, okay,” she says and then hands him an envelope, laughing. “I got this for you. For teacher appreciation week or whatever.”

“Thank you,” he says.

“It’s a Starbucks gift card,” she says. “I know you like coffee or…”

“I’ll act surprised when I open it,” he says and then smiles at her. “Thank you. It’s very sweet. I really appreciate it.”

She smiles too and says, “Okay. Gotta go. Love you.”

“Be good,” he says.

That night, he arrives home just before 6:00 after stopping at the pub for a few pints. He enters through the mudroom at the back of the house and places his satchel atop the rack next to the washer. He hangs up his coat on a hook above the bench by the back door and leaves his shoes lying in the middle of the floor to let the snow melt onto the throw rug. He steps into the house slippers he’d left lying there that morning before work.

He walks through the house to the front door and steps onto the porch to check the mail. There are a few letters in the box and a package from Amazon on the porch, all of which he brings into the living room. The mail is mostly junk mail and addressed to his wife, so he walks over to the paper shredder next to the secretary desk in the dining room and runs each envelope through the whirling blades, reducing it to confetti. The package he places atop the console table behind the sofa, where it joins three or four others, and then walks into the kitchen to make himself dinner.

On Sunday, he’d made a large pot of chili in the crockpot, and there’s still two days’ worth left in a glass container in the refrigerator, so he empties half of its contents into a bowl and microwaves it for 90 seconds. Then he stirs the chili and heats it for another 90 seconds before sprinkling on some shredded cheese from a package in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator. He returns both the container and the cheese to the refrigerator, which contains a jar of salsa, a six-pack of beer, a few bottles of hot sauce, a carton of milk, and a carton of eggs with four eggs remaining. He walks holding the bowl to the sofa and sits there eating the chili while he turns on the TV and watches the day’s headlines on a free app that streams local news.

When he finishes the chili, he walks into the kitchen and rinses the bowl in the sink before stacking it on the top rack of the dishwasher and placing the spoon in the utensil rack below. It’s been days since he has run the dishwasher, but it’s not even halfway full, so he closes it and begins to walk back toward the living room when he stops and remembers something. He walks back into the mudroom and opens his satchel on the laundry rack. He digs inside and pulls out an envelope. He then returns to the sofa and sits down before opening the envelope and removing both the Starbucks gift card and a greeting card with a picture of a wide-eyed orange tabby cat sitting before a steaming mug of black coffee. He opens the card, reads the message inside, and smiles.

He watches TV until 9:00 and then goes upstairs to get ready for bed. He has a quick shower and then walks into the bedroom. He switches on his lamp on the bedside table at right side of the bed, climbs under the covers, and opens his Kindle to continue where he left off in the book he’s reading. He reads until just before 10:00 before placing the Kindle back on the table. For a few seconds, he looks around the room. He looks at the identical bedside table to the left of the bed, now completely empty but for a few hair ties and a tube of lip balm. At the far wall, he sees the open, mostly vacant closet full of empty hangers along with a few of his dress shirts and blazers. Finally, he switches off the light, rolls onto his left side, and closes his eyes.",2,1769286613.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

(wasn't legally married but was a 10+ years relationship that died during the last year to year and a half) . I'm am very well resolved, and closed on that relationship. Nothing tying me back. Nothing weighing me down. Nothing but memories of the past, but without any significance for the present. That being said. I met a woman on FB Dating. We had 2 wonderful dates, we hit it off really well, conversation is fluid, we are constantly laughing throughout. On the second date we kissed. It was romantic and magical for both of us. We even did some light making out, passionately kissing against her car.

Then we decided to workout together. We had fun at the gym working out together. Again conversation was easy, we laughed, we kissed. She invited me for a coffee. It was again wonderful, and she was even getting physically closer to make sure our legs were between each other's legs. The I invited her for a quick bite. We walked to the place, holding hands, she even had her hands under my shirt on my back to warm them. We laughed, we were over the moon.

She new I recently separated. I never hid anything from her and was absolutely transparent with her. Honesty above all.

During dinner we still kept the same vibe. But then, in the end, she asked how long was I separated for. I was honest and told her one and a half month. Her demeanor changed immediately. She asked for us to pay the bill and leave as she needed to go. We walked back to the cars, her hands in her pockets and walking ahead of me. Rushing to the car. 

She says she needs time to digest it. To accept it. 

I really feel resolved, and she is in no way a rebound. I don't subscribe to rebounding, it's cruel. But I did really open my heart to her, and now it's been a week since we last saw each other. We only chat when I initiate. She says she didn't run away, just needs time. And I do understand and I don't at the same time. 

Is there a minimum time that I was not informed?

I’m interested in opening a small coffee shop/bakery in Senegal, but I don’t want to drain a large portion of my personal savings to do it. I currently have stable, full-time income in the U.S. and would prefer to keep most of my savings intact.

My question is: does Senegal allow business owners to open local bank accounts and take out business loans for startups? How does that process typically work, especially for someone who isn’t Senegalese by nationality?

For context, my husband is Senegalese, but we both currently live and work in the U.S. I’m trying to understand what financing options exist locally (banks, microfinance, partnerships, etc.) and what’s realistic before moving forward.

I’d love some local insight as we figure out where to land in Sacramento. I went to UC Davis and have visited Sac a ton over the years, so I have a general feel for the area, but I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve lived here long-term.

I just finished my 4yr residency in LA and accepted an amazing job offer back up north. It’s a float role, so I’ll be commuting to clinics in Rocklin (2 days), plus one day at Citrus Heights, Folsom, and Gold River during the week. Because I’ll be bouncing around, I’m trying to find a good “epicenter” neighborhood that keeps most drives \~30-35 minutes or less.

My partner is moving with me from LA (born and raised), so it’s a big change for him. We’re both 30, no kids yet (maybe in the future), and we honestly prefer beautiful, quieter suburbs with a sense of community over being right near downtown nightlife. We are trying to find tree-lined streets/curb appeal, parks and walking paths, safe neighborhoods, little shopping centers, coffee shops, or “old town” style hubs, places where you can walk the dog and feel at home.

We’re used to LA neighborhoods having their own mini-centers rather than going downtown all the time, so something with that vibe would be perfect.

Budget is around \~$700k for a SFH. We may want kids down the line, so good schools are a plus, but since that isn’t in the near future not a huge drawback.

Where are the “hidden gem” pockets that locals love? The neighborhoods that feel charming and livable without totally breaking the bank? I’m feeling pulled in all directions because of my float role, and it’s hard to imagine not having access to both 50 and 80 but locals obviously seem to be doing fine being away from one or the other…

Would really appreciate any thoughts or personal experiences. Thanks so much!",0,1769285718.0,Sacramento,11,0.5,False

1qlxjqc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlxjqc,Saint Xenia the Fool-for-Christ of St. Petersburg (January 24th/February 6th),"Saint Xenia was the wife of Colonel Andrew Theodorovich Petrov, who served as a court chanter. At twenty­six years of age, Xenia was widowed and, it seemed, lost her mind from grief. She distributed her possessions to the poor, clothed herself in the clothes of her reposed husband, and, as if having forgotten her own name, called herself by the name of her reposed husband ­ Andrew Theodorovich.

These eccentricities were not tied to the loss of reason, but only signified a complete disdain for earthly good things and human opinion, which places these good things at the center of existence. Thus, Xenia of Petersburg took upon herself the difficult ascesis of foolishness for Christ's sake.

Having come to know, through the death of her beloved husband, all the inconstancy and illusoriness of earthly happiness, Xenia strove toward God with all her heart and sought protection and comfort only in Him. Earthly, transitory good things ceased to have any value for her. Xenia had a house; but she gave it over to an acquaintance under the condition that she give shelter in it to paupers. But Xenia herself, not having a refuge, would wander among the paupers of Petersburg, while at night she would go out to a field, where she spent the time in ardent prayer.

When they began to build a church in the Smolensk Cemetery, Xenia, after the onset of darkness, would secretly carry bricks to the top of the construction, and thereby helped the masons erect the walls of the church.

Some of Xenia's relatives wanted to take her in and provide her with all necessities, but the blessed one replied to them: ""I do not need anything"".

She was glad of her indigence, and when passing by somewhere, would at times remark: ""I am all here"". When her reposed husband's clothing decayed, Xenia clothed herself in the poorest clothing, and on her feet wore torn shoes without stockings. She did not wear a warm dress and forced her body to suffer from the severe cold.

Sensing the greatness of Blessed Xenia's soul, the inhabitants of Petersburg loved her, because she despised the earthly for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. If Xenia would enter into anyone's home, this was considered a good sign. Mothers rejoiced if she kissed their children. Cab drivers would ask permission of the blessed one to drive her a little, since after this the earnings would be guaranteed for the whole day. Merchants in the bazaars would try to give here kalach \[a fancy bread ­ translator\] or some food. And if Blessed Xenia took something from what was offered, then all the wares of the seller would quickly be bought up.

Xenia had the gift of clairvoyance. On the eve of the Nativity of Christ in the year 1762, she walked about Petersburg and said: ""Bake pancakes; tomorrow all Russia will bake pancakes"" \[for memorial meals ­ translator\].

The next day, the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, suddenly died. A few days before the murder of the royal youth, John VI (Antonovich, the great­great­grandson of Tsar Alexis Michailovich), who in infancy had been proclaimed the Russian Emperor, the blessed one wept and repeated: ""Blood, blood, blood"". Within a few days after Mirovicha's unsuccessful conspiracy, the young John was killed.

Once, Xenia came to a home where there was a grown­up daughter. Turning to the girl, she said: ""Here you are drinking coffee, while your husband is burying his wife at Okhta"". After a certain time, this girl really did enter into marriage with a widower who at that moment was burying his first wife at the Okhta Cemetery.

Blessed Xenia died at the end of the 18th century, but tradition has not preserved either the year or the day of her decease. They buried her in the Smolensk Cemetery, where she had helped to build the church.

Pilgrimages to her grave began shortly after her decease. Blessed Xenia often appeared in visions to people in difficult circumstances, forewarned of dangers and saved from calamities. The righteous one has not ceased to show compassionate love toward all who with faith have called upon her, and many instances of her help for the suffering and those in desperate situations are known.

A Grodno civil servant, Nicholas Selivanovich Golovin, lived in Grodno approximately until the year 1907 and often experienced unpleasantness at work. He came to Petersburg to put his affairs in order, but they became even more entangled. Golovin was very poor, and in his care were his elderly mother and two sisters. In despair, he walked along the streets of Petersburg, and although he was a believing man, the thought to throw himself into the Neva stole into his soul. At this moment, in front of him stood some unknown woman, who struck him by her appearance and was partly reminiscent of a poor nun. ""Why are you so sad?"", she asked. ""Go to the Smolensk Cemetery, serve a panichida for Xenia, and everything will settle down"".

After these words, the unknown woman became invisible. Golovin fulfilled the advice of the mysterious nun, and his affairs unexpectedly were settled in the best manner possible. He returned home to Grodno joyful.

Emperor Alexander III, when he was the heir, became ill with a serious form of typhus. The Grand Duchess Maria Theodorovna was very alarmed by her spouse's illness. One of the valets, seeing her in the corridor, related to her how Blessed Xenia helps the sick, gave her sand from the cherished grave and added that he himself had been healed from illness by the prayer of the righteous one. The Grand Duchess placed the sand under the pillow of the patient, and in that same night, she, while sitting at the head of the bed, had a vision of Blessed Xenia, who told her that the patient would recover and in their family a daughter would be born. She should be called Xenia. The prediction of the blessed one was fulfilled exactly.

In the Pskov province, a relative from Petersburg came to stay for a while with a landowner and recounted how they revere Blessed Xenia in the capital. Under the influence of this account, the pious landowner prayed before sleep for the repose of her soul. At night, she dreamed that Xenia was walking round her house and pouring water on it. In the morning, the hay barn on the country estate caught on fire, but the fire did not spread further and the home remained whole.

A colonel's widow arrived in Petersburg to enroll her two sons into the Cadet Corps. She did not succeed in this. The money borrowed for the trip had come to an end, and the widow walked along the street and bitterly wept. Suddenly, some woman of the common people came up to her and said: ""Serve a panichida for Xenia, she helps in sorrows"". ""Who is this Xenia?"", asked the colonel's widow. ""The tongue \[that asks the way\] will lead to Kiev"", answered the woman of the common people and quickly vanished.

Indeed, the colonel's widow easily learned who this Xenia was, served a panichida for her at her grave in the Smolensk Cemetery, and shortly after unexpectedly received news that both her sons were accepted into the Corps.

A multitude of similar instances of Blessed Xenia's help are known also in our days.
