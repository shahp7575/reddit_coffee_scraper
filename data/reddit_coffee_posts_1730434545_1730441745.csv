1ggz0s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/asushin/comments/1ggz0s8/who_is_the_biggest_asushin_mari/,Who is the biggest Asushin? Mari,"Anyone care to go down a rabbit hole full of Anima spoilers and my own personal head cannon?  I repeat Anima spoilers.   

For a long time I have believed that Evangelion is a universe of reincarnation.  You can call it death and rebirth.  I always believed that it was absolutely not a loop, that time continued forward in one direction.  The reason it appears as a time loop is because everyone is being forced to replay a predetermined path.  The only thing that confused me was after the Anime/EoE, and also at the end of the Manga, I was unsure how they got from where it stopped to the entire planet being reincarnated and rebuilt to a certain state.  

In one situation instrumentality is avoided and the world is left uninhabitable with only two survivors.  It was noted that people would have the choice to live again due to the fact that instrumentality was denied, but I don't think that meant they would appear on the red Earth and all get to stare it the Lilith's head with Asuka and Shinji.  I believe what that meant is everyone gets a chance to be reincarnated next time.

In the manga, it was a fairly happy ending with everyone being able to live what appeared to be normal lives except for the fact that there were obvious remnants of Evas in the background.

The only thing I could come up with was that Yui floated in space until the entire Earth ended however long that took, billions of years possibly.  She would then reincarnate all the souls on the planet and somehow reformat the planet to a state where the environment was inhabitable yada yada we start over again but continue moving forward instead of resetting time.

Anima cleared up all of my failed attempts to determine what happened after instrumentality was avoided.  It clearly depicts what happens after we defy the will of the universe.  It clearly explains how everything gets rebuilt and the predetermined path is set up once again with the plan of proceeding with instrumentality.  At the same time it supports My views that all the evangelion media are connected, and that is not a loop but a linear path with a clearly defined past and future.  Last but not least it does use the body of the Evangelion that was the catalyst for the third impact.  But in a much more direct manner.  I'm trying not to get out any unnecessary spoilers. 

I'm sure after reading all of this you probably think I accidentally put the wrong title on this post but I'm getting to it.  Time to go down the rabbit hole. 

Who is Mari? 
 In the manga, there's a girl that appears to be the daughter of Asuka's stepmother.  She was mentioned very briefly as a object of jealousy for Kyoko. The image of this girl, created by Kyoko's memory was a girl that was possibly in her early teens very typical design but not necessarily looking like Mari. The stepmother on the other hand looks very much like Mari.  This image was from a memory before Asuka was conceived.  This memory led Kyoko to go through medical procedures to overcome her inability to have a child.  She wanted to have this child to compete with the mystery girl, and also compete with the man that left her.  Asuka was 4 when she went to live with her stepmother, but the mystery girl was nowhere to be seen and never mentioned again the entire manga.  Almost as if she no longer existed.  

In the Anime we never hear about this girl, but I believe that's because we received most of our perspective from the point of view of Asuka.  She never knew anything about this other girl except the potential that her mother may have mentioned her but at that age not being able to put face to the conversation she probably has no memory of it.  Here's where the conversation gets deep.  I believe this girl disappeared September 13, 2000.  I believe she was the donor or the Adam contact experiment.  I believe that she died during that experiment.  At this point in time, Kyoko still wanted a daughter, she proceeded with the artificial insemination shortly after.  Prior to her contact experiment with unit 02, she loved Asuka above all else.  Therefore even though the original plan for Asuka was to contact with 02, she chose to do it herself and spare Asuka.  Unfortunately this led for her no longer to love Asuka.

To sum up this idea.  Mari was the original contact for Adam and she did not survive.  She was the daughter of Asuka's stepmother.   She was not alive during the original anime or Manga.

My theory is that Nerv US in every media was working to clone Mari and build the Wolfpack Eva.  Unfortunately they never managed to complete it before the Third Impact.  Therefore we have never seen her before.

In Anima, the third impact is interrupted and avoided.  This allows three more years to pass on Earth uninterrupted.  The world progressing three more years allows us to meet Mari for the first time.

I will skip a lot of unnecessary spoilers once again.  But unfortunately there will be some more Anima spoilers right here.  All of the souls in Evangelion are saved and resurrected every time instrumentality is avoided.  This time because of the circumstances around Mari's cloning procedure and the combination of animal souls.  Armaros, the antagonist of Anima attempts to completely erase Mari from existence.  Combining with the souls of animals is seen as a sin in his eyes.  Asuka is able to save Mari from the void, and afterwards Mari clings to Asuka like a child to it's mother for a short time.  Mari spends much of her time in Anima wanting to be like Asuka.  There's a very strong attachment and admiration that she has for Asuka.  Shinji also spends quite a bit of time during the battles giving advice to Mari.  I'm sure she has strong feelings for the both of them.  

Here's some really heavy spoilers so if you haven't read Anima don't read this.  At the very end of Anima, where is Mari?  What does she have in her possession? She is resting at the remains of Eden, the birthplace of humanity, the Apples core.  She has the Ark which has all of the information of all the souls of all the animals and humans that were living on the earth.  She has the spear of longinus.  The Moon followed her in the spear to the apples core.  And she has also merged with Armaros.  The being created from the previous Ava that was the catalyst for the third impact.  The being that controls the recreation of Earth.  Why would they end Anima in a place where Mari has all of the pieces and all of the materials required to recreate the world?  Why did Anno take so much influence from Anima and put it into rebuild?  That is because rebuild is a world that Mari created to attempt to destroy Evangelion and give Shinji and Asuka the chance to be free from the punishment of original sin.   She wants to repay them for saving her from being erased, for mentoring, caring for her, and showing her what it means to be loved. She created an entire world to accomplish this.  That is also why in rebuild it appears that she knows more than she should.  She created an entire world for Asushin,  somehow people still get confused about the train station scene. 

Now let's take a look outside of Evangelion.  Let's take a look at some of the inspiration for the last movie.

Thrice Upon A Time is a science fiction novel by British writer James P. Hogan, first published in 1980.  Anno loves to reference books in his media.  
The slogan for Nerv ""God is in his heaven all's Right with the world."" Was the last sentence from the book Anne of the Green gables.(I know this is not the origin of this quote but this story is one of Anno's top 10 favorites) Anne is a red-headed girl with lots of spunk, the book follows her journey.  The anime adaption of this book is in his top 10 favorite anime, uses the same last sentence.

The book thrice upon a Time follows the story of a group of scientists that have found a way to send messages back and forth through Time which allows them to change the future.  Unavoidably every time they reset the future things started to go wrong and they had to once again perform a reset.   The woman in this book also is named Anne.  She is the love interest of the main character.  Every time they reset the world because of disaster they forget each other.  Every time they start from scratch and still fall in love.  Every time there's a cat involved that somehow causes them to meet each other again and fall in love.  Mari has always been portrayed as a cat like character.  Mari has existed in other media than rebuild and has even had cat ears in some occasions (Anima, which also heavily influenced rebuild) .  At the end of the book thrice upon a Time, the world has been reset, Anne and Murdoch (main character) have yet to meet this go around.  They just so happen to be at the same train station at the same time unknowingly. One was arriving and one was leaving.  The same cat belonging to Murdoch's uncle somehow made it to the train station.  The appearance of the cat lead to Murdock not boarding the train and meeting Anne just as fait has always brought them together.  Mari wants Asuka and Shinji to be together.  Anno don't want to give you the answers straight forward.  He wants you to think and pay attention to his hints.  In an interview at the one year anniversary of 3.0+1.0 he jokingly mentioned that Mari was taking Shinji to a local coffee shop. After they left the station to meet ""someone"". 

If you made it this far I applaud you.  I can only assume that most of my opinions are way too crazy to be useful.  But this is what you get.  Thank you for your time and would love to hear your thoughts.",1,1730441614.0,asushin,0,1.0,False

For as long as I can remember, men have never left me alone. The first time that I was catcalled by a grown man was at the age of 13. It’s created crippling social anxiety. I don’t like going out because I know a man will bother me. I’ve caught guys secretly taking photos of my ass, following me around stores, and have had them ask for my number in the worst situations. I have never thought it was flattering. I want to be invisible.

Constantly being pursued for sex gets redundant. Every time I give my number out, once they find out my age, the conversation quickly turns into an invite for sex. No joke, last year a man I met at Office Depot invited me to his house the same day he got my number. Not a date. Not even a cup of coffee. Just a “ I can make you pasta at my place” 🤦🏿‍♀️. Bear in mind, this gentleman had to have been a solid decade older than me. Way too many men think younger women ALL have low IQs and love dangerous sexscapades. I barely like men, esp older ones. Does this ever end? When you reached a certain age, did you find that men started to respect you? Do they just leave you alone entirely? Please share your experiences.

Welcome to our first discussion for our current Mod Pick read, *Wash Day Diaries* by Jamila Bowser and Robyn Smith.  This week we're covering the first three sections, Wash Day through Bright Side.

A woman, who we later learn is Kim, walks home after a night out.  She wakes up around 10 AM the next morning and starts to get ready, washing, conditioning, and detangling her hair in the shower.  Afterwards, she heads into the kitchen to make coffee and finds a note from her roommate Cookie - they're out of milk.  So Kim wraps her hair and gets dressed to run out, leaving a sleeping Cookie behind.  Kim heads to the bodega and grabs some milk and breakfast, all the while ignoring texts from Malik, who is clearly trying to suck up after he did something to annoy Kim.  Anyways, when Kim gets back to the apartment Cookie is awake.  Kim is about to tell Cookie about last night's party when Cookie has to take a call from her grandmother.  So Kim finishes her breakfast and then continues getting ready, showering and then styling her hair into twists.  Kim's just taken a hit when Cookie comes back in asking her about the party.  Kim tells her that she saw Cookie's crush Jordan and that she put in a good word for her, telling her to come to her show the next week and see Cookie.  And then Malik texts again because he's the worst.  Kim tells Cookie that Malik is texting her and wants her to come by his place, but she's not going anywhere because it's wash day.

A woman, who we later learn is Nisha, walks into a beauty supply store and purchases a bundle of hair.  Then she heads to a beauty salon for what is apparently a last minute appointment.  Phenix, the hairdresser, can just manage to fit her in though, so she starts on Nisha's hair, washing and blow-drying it.  Then Phenix starts braiding Nisha's hair and while she does so Nisha hops in the group chat with Kim, Cookie, and Davene to tell them what's going on.  The past weekend, Nisha went to an exhibit opening party with Daniel, a friend and colleague with some extra benefits.  At the party, Daniel tells Nisha that while they've had an on-off thing for a few years, he wants to try dating for real.  Nisha doesn't know what to say, which is definitely not what Daniel was hoping to hear.  He told Nisha she didn't have to have an answer right then, since he needed to head out early to finish preparing for his campaign anyways.  Daniel leaves and Nisha stays at the party a while longer.  A little while later, someone calls out to Nisha - it's Carl Depaul, a famous model and apparently a big fan of Nisha's work.  The two of them spend the rest of the party and the night together, before going to brunch the next day and spending the afternoon in the park.  That morning, Nisha had taken the subway out to Coney Island to shoot for Daniel's campaign, wondering what she was going to do about Daniel's offer; she had history with Daniel, but she'd also really enjoyed spending time with Carl.  Daniel greets Nisha when she arrives, and just before they get ready to talk Carl arrives! Turns out that he's filling in for the original model who can't make it.  Daniel is surprised that Nisha and Carl apparently know each other, so Nisha panics and says she has to leave because she unexpectedly got her period.  But Coney Island is really far, so Nisha doesn't want to waste the trip - she texts Phenix to see if she can squeeze her in for an appointment.  As she's on the train back, someone calls out her name, but Nisha doesn't get to explain who it was in the group chat because her phone dies.  Eventually, Phenix finishes her hair and Nisha leaves, satisfied with her new braids.

We see Davene having a sleepless night, with no new posts on Instagram to at least distract her.  Eventually, her alarm goes off and she reluctantly gets out of bed, wishing she hadn't skipped her hair appointment yesterday.  She texts her hairstylist Michelle to see if she can fit her in but Michelle is booked for the week.  So Davene calls out for work and then tries to figure out what to do with her hair.  She texts Cookie to see if she can stop by to do her hair, because a previous bad experience has her sure that she can't wear her natural hair to work again.  Fortunately Cookie can stop by before work, so while she's on her way Davene showers and washes her hair.  Cookie buzzes to be let in to the building and Davene frantically tries to pick up her apartment while Cookie takes the stairs.  Even then, Cookie still notices that things are out of place, asking Davene if she's ok since it's unlike her.  Davene plays it off as just looking for something she lost, and they head into the bathroom so Cookie can braid Davene's hair.  After she finishes, Davene thanks Cookie, who asks her how things have been since she's been so quiet in the group chat recently.  Davene explains that she's been struggling mentally for the past few months.  Work has been rough, and Davene isn't sure she's cut out for social work anymore, but she's not sure she can afford to change careers.  At the same time, she also feels like everyone has things figured out and together while she's so lost.  Cookie tries to encourage Davene to stay positive and remember the good things she does have, like her health and relationships with loved ones.  Davene tells Cookie she's started going to therapy and that she's been considering taking antidepressants, which alarms Cookie.  Cookie tells Davene that she seems fine and that she doesn't know how the antidepressants might affect her.  Cookie gives Davene a piece of citrine she has in her bag - it's a piece of rock that she can wear against her skin that will help ward off negative thoughts.  Davene awkwardly thanks her and suggests that she might want to get to the train early since it's unpredictable and she doesn't want to be late for work.  Cookie agrees and leaves after confirming that Davene still plans to attend Kim's show that weekend.  Afterward, Davene goes to use hairspray but finds the bottle empty.  Defeated, she climbs back into bed.

Has this happened to anyone else?,"My mom (57F) was diagnosed with Epilepsy 10 years ago and has been on lamictal since her tonic clonic In 2014. That was her only tonic clonic, the other seizures have just been absence seizures.  
This week her lamictal was upped by 50 mg due to having lots of seizure activity in her temporal lobe in her last MRI a few weeks ago. A few days ago she started complaining of lots of headaches and was extremely tired. We both chalked it up to the adjustment to her new dose. 
She woke up Tuesday morning saying she felt much better. She brewed coffee, got the mail, did all her normal things. We were watching tv in the living room and suddenly said she felt really dizzy and her vision was double. She’s never had double vision before and it concerned me immediately, within a minute of her saying this she stood up and fell into the coffee table and her speech was slurred in a way I had never heard before. I helped her get on to the couch and her speech got increasingly more slurred and hard to understand within seconds.
She was conscious and aware the whole time but she was saying the same few things like in a loop. She remembers herself laughing hysterically while I ran upstairs to change, I told her I was going to call 911 and she started screaming no over and over. I put on a pair of jeans, preparing us to go to the hospital and they showed up within 10 minutes. They heard her slur her birthday and name they told her they were going to take her to the hospital and they carried her out. She was agreeable and answered all their questions but was really out of it and could hardly speak. Her mouth was numb but it wasn’t specific to one side and she was as aware of everything. She could smile evenly, moved her arms and legs the way they wanted and passed every memory test including what our address was. On the way outside she made sure to tell them what hospital she wanted to go to, told me to fill our cats water dishes, lock our front door, etc. 
They treated it like a stroke and gave her asprin in the ambulance because that was what it looked like to me in the moment and also what I said to the operator and paramedics. We got to the hospital and they put me in the waiting room until they deemed her ready for me to see her. 
I was calling everyone, hyperventilating, acting absolutely hysterical in the ER bathroom thinking these were my last moments with my mom. 
I finally got to see her maybe an hour later and she was almost completely back to normal. 
Her speech was fine aside from being a little slower than usual, gait was normal, and was still repeating some questions but was mostly alright. They did a CT scan and even though nothing came up abnormal, they admitted her for 2 days for further testing. They did an MRI, ECG and hooked her up to a 24 hour EKG. Everything came up normal and nothing else ended up happening. The doctors are still baffled as to what happened and can’t decide between a TIA or a seizure. They ruled out a major stroke. She was discharged today and remembers everything. Can seizures present this way? Hers never have but it could always be a first. She said there was no aura like there was with her tonic clonic and no warning aside from the headache, double vision, and dizziness. She had a seizure last summer that presented as complete confusion and odd behaviors that lasted a few days but it was completely different from this. Paramedics couldn’t take her and the hospital wouldn’t admit her so that episode was never documented.

Two surgeries and turns out all I needed was this low cost simple treatment that no doctor would ever prescribe. And yes you can buy the peptides just have to find a reputable source. FDA needs to stop trying to prohibit this potentially life saving therapy. The stack is KPV 250mcg dose plus GHKCU 250mcg dose. Tapering off GHK CU now just to KPV as I feel that it is enough just to keep inflammation down and my sinus tissue has healed from the GHK CU already.

1ggyjz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ggyjz8/weird_christian_tricks_with_treats/,Weird Christian tricks with treats ,"This isn't a big deal at all, more just silly and slightly cringey. Wondering if anyone else has stories like this. 

I grew up in a very religious place and would get Christian literature at some houses (I remember one house gave out pamphlets with toothpaste, which really do you think a seven year is going to read your pamphlet at home when you give them toothpaste? C'mon man there's no rule against sugar). But I live in silicon valley now, which isn't actually at all liberal in the way most of the country imagines, and plenty of people are religious, but there isn't much proselytizing. The outreach is fairly subtle, putting on public Easter events and such. There's a church group that goes to a children's playground on weekends and stand there singing at the kids playing,  which isnt cool, but we don't play at that playground so I resist the urge to troll them. Generally it's a pretty good place to be irreligious. 

Tonight my son was trick or treating and it was one of the houses that has a tent out front and is giving out coffee and such to grownups*. He came away with a little handmade bracelet they'd given him. When we got home he explained that they told him the red stones were the blood of Christ who gave his life so he (my son) would be saved. Which is some bullshit, I love the kid but he certainly doesn't obey me and I don't know if Pokemon are technically idols but he certainly worships them. Anyways it's just such a weird way to try to slam some religion into a fun night. And what the hell, we can transubstantiate red plastic gems into the blood of Christ now? 

Anyways it wasn't a biggie and didn't get my hackles up (mostly because it's such a fail--my son walked away thinking he had some magical blood bracelet) but I'm curious about similar things others have experienced.

1ggyilg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tonsilstones/comments/1ggyilg/here_is_my_solution_important/,Here is my solution ( important ),"For about two years, I suffered severely from tonsil stones. I never had tonsil stones before, but they started appearing after I contracted COVID-19. Waking up every morning and swallowing that disgusting taste of tonsil stones was frustrating. I was also constantly worried that the smell might be noticeable to others, which added to my irritation.

Every two weeks or at least once a month, I would visit the ENT clinic to get the stones removed. Even after removing them thoroughly with a laryngoscope at the clinic, they would return within 2-4 weeks, often coming out unexpectedly while I brushed my teeth.

The ENT specialists couldn't pinpoint the exact cause of the stones, but they said surgery was the only definitive solution. I decided not to undergo surgery, viewing it as the last resort. As I wondered why these stones only appeared after COVID-19, I started researching online and found that tonsil tissue degeneration might be strongly linked to tonsil stones.

So, I began searching for non-surgical solutions, referencing sources on Reddit and other sites. Here are the methods I tried, which I’d like to share with you all, as I found a lot of helpful information from others online.

Currently, I no longer taste tonsil stones when swallowing. I’ll be confirming with an ENT visit soon to be completely sure.

Here’s what I did:

1. Took a Vitamin D3 + K2 supplement (right after lunch).
2. Took a multivitamin (between lunch and dinner in the afternoon).
3. Took Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Zinc (after dinner).
4. Brushed and gargled my throat along with my teeth before bed (using a gargle containing Benzethonium chloride).
5. Took an oral probiotic after gargling and let it dissolve in my mouth before sleeping.
6. Drank weaker coffee instead of strong coffee.

I haven’t listed specific product names, as I didn’t want this to come off as an advertisement.

I hope this helps free you from tonsil stones.

Braking. The brakes don't feel direct, there's some sort of fuckery where I have to press too hard for what should be more like 'covering' and very high up in the action there feels like some kind of assist and it grabs twice as hard as it did 3mm before. Also, when coasting to a stop, holding constant pressure, there is a moment near a full stop where something in the transmission or engine (dis)engages and the car pulls harder forward, going faster and requiring more pressure. Annoyingly difficult to make a smooth stop without a skill game of brake pedal pressure

Road noise! There is an incredible amount of road noise

Suspension feels great on smooth roads with dips and such but smaller, sharper bumps really stab through the chassis. Certain surfaces around home are fairly rough and my e46 never chattered me half as much as this X1 does

Rear camera takes forever to engage after reverse is selected

The auto-off feature in eco mode. When the engine starts up again it shakes the whole car uncomfortably hard

Cupholder placement sucks. It's up under the dash and not at all convenient. A 20oz coffee cup with lid requires too much attention to handle. And it's juuust far enough away that I have to lean forward and that annoys the crap out of me

Finally, there is a weird sensation in the steering wheel that I haven't quite figured out. In most cases it's solid, smooth, consistent but occasionally I'll feel like the front wheels are lifted and I can rotate almost freely without changing steering angle. Usually at low speed or just after starting

Anyways, it's super cozy overall. Love the turbo power in it. The moon roof, visibility in general is amazing. HK sound is great. My favorite feature are the little side lights that come on when going around turns

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- A second jam emerges post refrain with some brief funk and then works its way into a bouncy upbeat groove with a tasty ""Third Stone From the Sun"" tease in Trey's soloing. This vibe continues towards the end of the jam until the band makes a nifty move back to ""CDT"" for a second pass at the traditional song ending.   
  
[Blaze On](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/blaze-on>) \- The jam breaks out into some raunchy, textured rock but does not last long before a shift to major around 10 minutes. From there, a mellow groove of bass, keyboards, and organ effects from Trey unfolds and gradually gains intensity as guitar becomes more prominent. After the peak, there is an outro of synchronized stop-start ""woo"" riffs and > to ""NMINML"".   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- The typical ""Twist"" jam features good variation and dynamics modulation. Things begin to peel away around 5:20, with a mode change. Following some brief, upbeat playing, the jam begins to rock, as well as further explore. Unexpectedly at around 9:35, Trey and others add moaning, vocal chanting to mix, which combines well with Page's circus-like organ playing. The vocals here are a big plus, providing an element of surprise to a quality, improvisational jam.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey teased Jean Pierre in Wolfman's Brother, Third Stone From the Sun in Chalk
Dust Torture, and Cool Amber and Mercury in NMINML. Fuego and Twist contained
Pictures of Matchstick Men teases. Fish quoted The Final Hurrah in I Been
Around. Hood contained We Are Come to Outlive Our Brains teases from Mike and
Trey and quotes from Fish.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Crosseyed and Painless](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/crosseyed-and-painless>) \- This version serves as the launching pad for one of the better sequences of songs from Fall 2014. It never turns into the full on shred fest that most expect out of this song. It sits on a loose funky groove based jam with some good synth work from Page. About 2/3's of the way through, Fishman escalates the tempo before they bring things back down and actually execute a smooth transition into Light.   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- While never departing ""Twist"" proper, this version includes ""Lengthwise"" and ""Manteca"" quotes, several ""Manteca"" teases, solid ""Type I"" play, and a cerebral ending transition.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Dog Faced Boy was played for the first time since June 8, 2011 (144 shows).
Birds of a Feather contained teases and quotes from The Birds. Twist contained
Lengthwise quotes, Manteca teases and quotes, a Smoke on the Water tease and
Your Pet Cat teases.

Encore  : [ Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley ](<https://phish.net/song/sneakin-sally-through-the-alley>)

[1] Keywords: Bush & O.G. Kush.  
[2] Bush and kush references.  
[3] Alternate lyrics referencing bush and kush.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- A quality ""old school"" version with a lot of good ""Type I"" variation in the jamming, building up to an intense peak.   
  
[Twist](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/twist>) \- The jam breaks away at 6:15, growing melodic and upbeat. Mike adds some great bass effects before a euphoric groove emerges. Then a fun ""Under Pressure"" jam develops, followed by beautiful low-key jamming.   
  
[Makisupa Policeman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/makisupa-policeman>) \- Another fun, funky version with ""Kush"" and ""Bush"" chanting, lots of weirdness, and a few genuinely musically impressive passages interspersed here and there.   
  
[Boogie On Reggae Woman](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/boogie-on-reggae-woman>) \- > from ""Meatstick"". There's some extra funky mustard on this one and it also includes alternate lyrics referencing bush and kush, as well as a tease of the ""Theme from the Rockford Files."" Ends with a > to ""The Wedge"".   
  
[Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sneakin-sally-through-the-alley>) \- A solid and funkified breakdown jam follows a good vocal jam and includes Trey banter near the ending.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Runaway Jim contained quotes by Trey of theme from  _Shaft_  including ""Who's
the green private dick who's a sex machine to all the chicks? Cactus! John
Cactus."" Before Halfway to the Moon, Trey noted that the band is excited about
the tune, and he hopes that it makes the new album, _Wingsuit_ . Bowie featured
teases of Jesus Just Left Chicago (in the intro) and Beethoven's Symphony No. 5
in C minor (in the jam). Twist included a Long Tall Glasses tease and quote, a
Get Back tease, and an Under Pressure jam. The keywords for Makisupa were ""Bush""
and ""O.G. Kush."" Both keywords were repeated throughout this version of Makisupa
and were referenced later in the set during Meatstick and Boogie On, which also
included a tease of the theme from The Rockford Files by Mike. Sally contained a
_Shaft_ quote and ended with a Call to the Post tease.

[4] No whistling.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Back on the Train](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/back-on-the-train>) \- Acoustic version from Festival 8.   
  
[McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mcgrupp-and-the-watchful-hosemasters>) \- Gorgeous acoustic version from Festival 8.   
  
[Undermind](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/undermind>) \- Exceptionally strong playing from Trey in this roaring ""Type I"" version.   
  
[Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/light>) \- A dissonant/loop jam loaded with spacey effects emerges from ""Light"" proper. Part of a great sandwich with ""Mike's"" and ""Slave.""   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show was part of the three-show [ Festival 8 ](<http://www.phish.com/festival8>) . The first set, which started at noon, was billed as Phish's ""first full-length acoustic set"" (complete with complimentary coffee and Festival 8 themed donuts). The first set featured Trey and Mike on acoustics, Page solely on piano, and a unique stage setup that had Fish stage right with Page on the far left. Before Brian and Robert, Trey encouraged the crowd to sit down due to the ""mellow"" nature of the set; he added that they had never before played to a crowd that was sitting. Whether the crowd should stand up or sit down became a running joke throughout the set, until Trey confessed during Wilson that he only asked the crowd to sit down at the request of the crew and, in fact, he hates telling people what to do (and also hates sitting down). This show marked the Phish debuts of Invisible and Sleep Again. Fish performed a whistle solo on My Sweet One. The band briefly left the stage after McGrupp, returning to encore with Driver, Talk, and Secret Smile. The second and third sets were played later that evening. Reba lacked the whistling ending. Trey took a moment before Tweeprise to thank those who helped put on the festival.

**Show Notes:**  
  
Divided Sky was dedicated to Sun Ra. 'A' Train contained Dixie teases from Trey.
Tweezer included Wait quotes from Trey. After Pusherman (Curtis Mayfield), Trey
explained that Hold Your Head Up became the Henrietta theme (prompting teases of
HYHU by Page and Mike) because Fish hates that song more than any song ever
written except La Bamba (which was then also teased by Page and Mike); the
Pusherman theme was offered because Fish likes that song. Trey noted that Stash
was a request from some friends of theirs on the phish.net. Trey explained
phish.net and that the band was honoring requests.

1ggy6of,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadNeighbors/comments/1ggy6of/help_i_have_an_ahole_neighbour/,Help!! I have an A-Hole neighbour! ,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Apologies for the long post. I need some advice about a troublesome neighbour. Let's call him Joe. I know this is not a unique situation but Im at a loss of what to do. 

So some background on the community - I live in a ""suburb"" type community I guess you could say. It's people trying to get away from the hussle and bussle and noise of the city. 

It's a somewhat rural and remote community. Houses are on 1/2 acre-ish lots so not super far apart but more than in the city. Nearest town is like a 40 min drive away. It's also ocean front so you know people want their privacy! There are basically no street lights, and only one road in and out. People are usually lights out by 9 pm, and VERY quiet! They are also VERY friendly! Well... Except for Joe. 

I moved in about 4 months ago and am in LOVE with this community!! BUT this neighbour has been a thorn in my side! He has a reputation in the community as well. Whenever I meet people in the area they all say ""oh you live next to HIM!? Ouch..."". 

Basically he BLASTS his music SO loud at all times of day and night. He also has a dog that he leaves outside basically 24-7 that barks and barks and barks. But that's a whole other post! I feel so bad for that dog, but that gives you an idea of thy type of guy we are dealing with. Zero respect for anybody. 

Back to the music.... Oh boy... It is so loud and basey that I literally see those sound vibrations or ripples in my coffee cup or wine glass (depending on time of day of course). I have asked him VERY politely ""hey Joe, not sure if you are aware but your music is really quite loud. Would you be able to turn it down just a touch? It's really disruptive."" To which he replied ""absolutely not. You have neighbours you know. They are going to play music sometimes. Deal with it. You're going to have to get used to hearing my music sometimes and I don't give a flying f**k if you can hear rot in your house"". Joe is a peach - did I mention that? I just said ""okay, thanks Joe.""

I have tried killing him with kindness - brought him home made cookies, wave and say hi every time I see him, and tried to get to know him and befriend him. Maybe if we become friendly he will be less likely to want to intrude on my peace and quiet. Nope, Joe is just an a-hole. Plain and simple. 

Anyways, the community is an ""improvement district"" which in my area means we aren't part of the county or regional district, so access to bylaw enforcement officers or police is basically like absolute emergency only, and they come from that town 40 mins away. I've tried calling and reporting but they never come out even though they say they will.

I don't want to start a neighbour war - I value peace and quiet and I don't want drama. BUT I think I may need to start getting petty! Basically, what I'm asking, is what would you do if this were your situation? Ive thought of installing a bright security/flood light pointed towards his house. His bedroom window faces the back corner of my house. But that could annoy other neighbours, and I really do love all the other neighbours around me. I OF COURSE don't want to do damage to his property or do anything illegal that could get me into trouble, but if I can cause him some slight inconvenience in response to his music to try and get my points across, I would try it! Suggestions welcome! Thanks all! ",2,1730437923.0,BadNeighbors,1,1.0,False

My husband (32M) and I (29F) are currently visiting his cousins place for a few days. This is our first time staying at their home and my husband hasnt been in touch with his cousin A (32F)for many many years and they only reconnected a year ago. 

Cousins husband B is very friendly, goes out of the way to make me feel comfortable, plans trips for us, takes us out to meals and activities and is always bright and chirpy and overall a wonderful human being 

A on the other hand, is being very cold and is ignoring my presence. We only got here yesterday and she already is grumpy, is cold, never offers tea/coffee/water until I ask (this is my first time here and I barely know them, so it’s weird for me to just go to the kitchen and help myself). She also never smiles/ acknowledges my presence, never makes a conversation with me. It feels so awkward to be around her and I’m stuck here for the next 4 days. 

Today B was praising my skills in sports to A and A cut him off and literally shut down the conversation and was very rude to him and asked him to stop talking. 

I felt a lump in my throat and felt so unwelcome at that moment, I don’t know what I did to deserve so much hatred /hostility. 

I plan to just stay in my room, go down to the living room only for coffee/lunch and make small talk with B alone. I don’t want to attempt even saying hi to A unless she apologizes. 

My husband fully supports me and thinks I’m justified and he promised me that we ll never visit again since it’s so uncomfortable. 

Am I in the right here? Am I justified in feeling this way? What would you do in this situation?

I work as a receptionist/administrator for a health clinic where we do procedures and small tests. We, as administrators schedule these appointments for people at certain times depending on their test. We text them, telling them to call us and confirm that that is an appropriate time for them. Most call, others we have to chase up. All fine.

Comes the day of their appt and they show up two hours early for their appt and expect to be seen early because 'they have another appt at that time and can't miss it'. We why the fuck say you can do our time then if you cant???? Then come in and think you should be seen bc you're better than everything one else 🙄🙄. We schedule your appt at that time and can't do any earlier. I say no sorry and  they'll have to wait...and they do?? In the office?? Like go away and come back and not just sit in our office watching us working?? I get a satisfaction by making them wait, but jeez go for a coffee somewhere, shop around!!

Then there's the opposite where they come super late and still expect to be seen...ahhh no ma'am you will be rebooked. You didn't show up nor call us, so no. Then they get angry when I say I can't fit then in for another month as if it's MY fault, ugh. 

In case you can't tell, I genuinely like my job and 90% of the people that come in are amazing. But there's just that 10% of people who I reeeealllyyyy just want to tell to shove it where the sun don't shine 🌞🌞.

##Do not downvote entries

How you upvote is entirely up to you. You are absolutely encouraged to recreate the shared drinks, but this may not always be possible or viable and so should not be considered as a requirement.

__________________________

The events of The New Verse take place five years after the game’s main story line, John Streetfighter has disappeared entirely and as a result of this the streets of Metro CIty are once again at the mercy of gang-violence. Nowadays, The Crows and Mad Gear Gang are retired; the two original Metro City gangs were taken over and snuffed out by a trio of newly arisen gangs. Metro City is now fought over by The Purple Dragons, The Brickstown Brawlers and the Ace Of Spades. The Purple Dragons are a off-branch triad association making their rise from Metro City’s Chinatown District, The Purple Dragons specialize in a number of illicit operations but their most profitable endeavors are prostitution, street racing ,grand theft auto, drug trade & extortion.Then there’s the Brickstown Brawlers; they are a rowdy lot of misfits and knuckleheads who’re mostly just looking for a group to call their own but then there are those members who’ve ran into the ranks of The Brickstown Brawlers in search of strength and protection amidst all the turmoil and uncertainty that’s plagued the streets of Metro City. The Brickstown Brawlers are the most “civil” gang out of the three, they mainly deal in vandalism & illegal underground fighting.Finally, there’s the Ace Of Spades, the Ace Of Spades are an international secrete society that’s just recently expanded onto Metro City and now the Ace Of Spades works to control Metro banks, major corporate offices, star politicians and more- The Ace Of Spades strives to control Metro CIty from the inside out through extortion, blackmail, racketeering, assassination & more. Now, the only form of resistance to the new Metro City gangs is Metro Cities own police department which is now led by a new chief and then there’s a growing number of vigilantes on the rise; they’re fighters, formidable combatants who’ve taken their talents and put them to use for the greater good of Metro Cities ordinary citizens. 



The New Verse follows the story of a youngman by the name of Lee-Wu, Lee-Wu lives near Metro City’s Chinatown district, he’s got dreams of being a famous fighter; Lee-Wu is a huge fan of Ken Masters, Lee-Wu was trained by his grandfather; Lee-Wu’s grandfather was a “self-taught” Martial Artist who got his style from mimicking the moves and techniques he saw being practiced by a “wild man”(Akuma) who lived in the wilderness not too far away from his childhood village. Lee-Wu lives in to Metro City along with his uncle and cousins who are the leading members of Metro Cities notorious Purple Dragon gang, Lee-Wu doesn’t get along with his family because of their criminal lifestyle, so, Lee-Wu has distanced himself from his family and he fights against Purple Dragon thugs and vandals with hopes of giving Metro City’s Chinatown shop owners and citizens a chance at a normal life & fair opportunity again.

so my grandfather just passed away today. he was doing okay literally just 2 days ago. as usual, he was going to his weekly dialysis and suddenly became paralyzed and unconscious. we thought he'd be okay since he finally woke up and was able to talk despite being unable to move his body but turns out, it was much worse. i don't know the details but apparently a bump in his stomach was starting to form and he couldn't breath properly and also kept puking and needing to poop. nobody knew what exactly was wrong as the nurses didn't really do anything and kept relying on the doctor who was barely checking up on him. he was supposed to be alive, he was supposed to come home. he was supposed to be transferred into another building, we thought he'd be recovering. 

but when my dad came back to the hospital to help, he was already gone— he was dead. if he held on for a few more weeks, he could've seen my sister turn 12 and pass the pisay exam (pisay is basically a really prestigious school for smart kids and all), if he held on a few more months longer, he could've seen my aunt graduate highschool and pass her college entrance exam, and if he lived another year longer, he could've seen me graduate junior high and move into a better school for senior high.  he could've turned 65 next year then 66 then 67 and so on. i don't get it. he was doing okay, he could've been okay. that day he was first admitted in the hospital was the last time he ever said my name, the last time he ever called out for me and the last time i ever touched him. 

the grandfather i longed for my whole life is gone and i genuinely don't know what to do and how to react. i hate the hospital for doing 0 shit to help my grandfather get better and i also hate myself for being unable to grieve properly as grief is such a foreign feeling for me. today is apparently going to be his funeral (i honestly don't know how) and i just can't stop cursing the nurses and the doctor in my head. i remember them just looking at him in this bitchy way and their tone full of fucking arrogance (that i could just shove it down their throat) and then moving on. like, what the hell. 

it feels so weird without him now. there's no one to tell me to make him coffee for breakfast, no one to tell me to turn the music on because of how silent it is, no one to wait for me, my sister and my aunt outside when we get home from school, no one for me to remind to drink medicine— everything feels so still and quite, it's like all the liveliness in our house just disappeared along with him. everything feels dead and empty, as well as me.

I heard a metal cover of it and knew I wanted to put it in a science fiction story centered around Halloween. I took the lyrics, rewrote them while trying to keep as much of the song's energy as I could and tried to theme it around something for this type of sub.  On with the story.*

Jazak docked at the port of the travel agency, looked over to his mate Fenna and gave her a nudge. Having been engrossed in the newest issue of ""Tales from Deep Space"", she startled in her seat before letting out a small nervous laugh.

""You poked me in the ribs right when the tentacle monster poked the protagonist.""

""Oops, hehe. Sorry, but we are here. Time to fetch the kiddos.""

Of course he wasn't entirely sorry. She was working herself up for what they were about to do, after all. He opened the back cabin compartment of the family transport vessel and roused Helck, Sivix, and Bobta from were their sleepy tails had settled and fallen asleep during the long ride. Small furry faces lit up upon waking and realizing the engines of the craft were off.

""Are we there yet?"" 

""I'm hungry.""

""I gotta pee!""

Jazak smirked. ""No Bobta, we still have to take a trip in a company ship but it will be very quick, I promise. And of course Sivix is hungry and Helck has to pee, you two always are this way when we stop somewhere. We can take care of that before we leave.""

To that, the five stepped away from their ship and made their way into the travel agency. After purchasing a pass, a light meal and taking care of other business; they seated themselves into a company transport vessel. People of every sort were there, mostly various families of different Space Pact Alliance races but a number of young couples and a multi-species youth group as well. Many of which had to be helped and buckled in by a very patient stewardess with many hands. All settled in, everyone braced for take off as the engines kicked in and the craft began along its oft-traveled trajectory route.

Meanwhile:

The raiders of the pirate ship ""Bloodscale"" crept within range of their unwary target, an old derelict human trade hub that had been acquired by a tourist agency and fixed up for tours. Content to wait out of sight, it wasn't so much the station the captain and crew were interested in so much as it was the soon to be group of hostages who were there for a night of ""fun and scares"". The Bloodscale captain Has'vok the ""Blood Maw"" chuckled to himself, ""I can give you all some fun and scares. Especially you and your family, Enforcer Jazak and Governor Fenna. Our old captain will be either freed or avenged."" The crew of the Bloodscale would wait until the hostages were inside the hub then take both the company ship and the station.

At the hub:

The company star ship docked at the hub and the passengers found themselves standing in a very dimly lit and ancient-looking port. The stewardess stepped off the ship ramp and turned to face the group. ""Here we are folks, at the port of the old human trade hub ""Convergence Fairway Station"", or the ""Hauntway Hub"" as we now prefer to call it."" Excited murmurs rose from crowd as youngsters chattered and couples began poking fun at each other and making spooky silly faces.

Helck leaned in to whisper in the ear of his younger sister. ""Ghosts of monsters gonna come alive and gobble up little Bobta. You are the smallest one here.""

Bobta's eyes grew wide, ""No! I don't believe in ghosts. And ghosts couldn't eat anything anyways!""

""Are you so sure about that? I wouldn't be."", Helck grinned before straightening himself back up.

""Mommy, Helck is being mean to Bobta!"", tattled Sivix who was the middle sibling.

Helck turned to make clawed fingers at Sivix, who leaned away to avoid a tickling.

Fenna without so much as a hard look at her pups just gave the same scolding as always. ""Pipe down and behave! We are in public and are here to have a good time. It will start soon enough.""

The pilot of the company ship received a message from the hub announcing that the tour was starting, and paged the stewardess to communicate the same. She turned towards on of the many dark shadows in the port and gave a brief nod and smile before returning to the ship. Without a warning, the ship's engines engaged, the ramp folded up and the hatch shut; and it began to lift away from the dock leaving a now actually nervous crowd behind. The dramatic surprise created such distraction that they forgot about the shadows, and an elderly old gentleman snuck up on the group.

""Hello"", he said with a wide grin. 

Nearly every tourist jumped as they turned to face the human. A few even rudely but understandably bared fangs and unsheathed claws. The man, who was dressed in an elegant but antiquated dark suit with large buttons and a fine brimmed hat continued. ""It seems I have a new group to guide around these old halls and rooms today. I am Mr. Gary Jeff Brown, your tour guide and the descendant of a one time trader here at the Hauntway Hub from back in the day when it was called Convergence Fairway Station. One Mr. Alan Ray Brown, an arms and spice trader. But you may call me Jeffy.""

He paused a moment to let that sink in. ""Before we start, does anyone have any last moment objections and wish to return to the ship? I know it flew off but it is actually only a short distance away. Does anyone have any medical issues that could lead to an emergency?"" A moment of relief came over the crowd as they all nodded no.

""No? Good, I hope you all have strong hearts and stomachs or your species' circulatory and digestive equivalents!"", He said in a disturbingly merry sort of way. ""Let us start then.""

The tour guide walked them up to an old, bulky metal gate and placed both palms upon its surface. It slowly groaned and grated as it pulled itself open. A rush of air carried over the crowd the musty scent of what felt like the gaping mouth of an old space dungeon. Or what their imaginations would have them assume of such. Most of them had never adventured their way on that type of tour.

Darkness gave way to sputtering lights, casting shifting shadows until finally stabilizing into a dim yellow glare from the ceiling. Room after room they went past, each carefully supplied with period furniture, crates of would be goods, and pieces of artwork of the types representative of the last traders stationed at the hub. Trade shops, auditoriums, food courts, bars and even an old theatre greeted them as the guide went by and explained each one. All the while Jazak kept spotting a shadow move in the corner of his eye.

""...This is where old man Findley, the owner of the hub, drank his coffee every morning....""

Suddenly, a pale visage of an old human man flashed into existence; raising a large mug to his lips before glancing straight at Helck. He licked his lips and disappeared.

""I volunteer my eldest brother to be eaten with your drink, Mister Ghostly Human!"", exclaimed an anxious Bobta.

""Yeah."", agreed a Sivix who had looked away at something and was oblivious to the sight.

Helck shot a betrayed look at them both, having forgotten his earlier mischief. Fenna shot them all a look as she admirably held her ground.

""...Over here you see where Mallis of the Fritass people had his legendary FTL drives set up on display, sometimes I hear him start up his recordings in the middle of the night...""

A worrisome flicker of the overhead lights and a faint distant growl disturbed what peace still existed in Jazak as he jumped back and looked around.

""Middle of the night?"", one of the youth group members queried, apparently not told by his parents or legal guardians what kind of trip this was before sending him off with the chaperones.

Jeffy the guide stopped a moment. ""Yes, we have living quarters set up here in some of the spare rooms the trade station kept for storage and other necessities. You and your guardians, as well as myself will be staying here until tomorrow morning. We will be having a dinner shortly after the tour back in the food court, a short performance at the theatre, then I will see you off to your rooms."" The youth was not entirely happy hearing this and began to twitch.

Helck and Bobta both silently wondered if Jeffy could feed Mr. Findley something non-person.

Another flickering of the lights accompanied an even closer sounding growl as the tapping of sharp unsheathed claws echoed across tile floors. The youth from before whimpered to his chaperone.

Jeffy smiled reassuredly at the young kitten. ""Don't mind Miss Boo here, she was a loyal pet and valued friend to my ancestor, Alan. She is just protective of this place and is probably just a bit startled at our presence. Come out and say hello to us, Miss Boo.""  

The biggest, whitest dog Jazak and his family had ever seen ran out of a nearby darkened hallway and into another room before appearing suddenly in front of the whole group. It walked up to Jeffy, sniffed his hand and wagged its tail before wandering up to Fenna and sniffing her shoe. Fenna lost her composure and stifled a gasp as she took a step back. The pale spectre looked at her soulfully in the eyes for a long moment, then abruptly vanished.

""Just one more area before we start our other activities. This way please."" Jeffy led them to the last trade shop, still somehow heavy with the smell of rich spices and to Jazak's nose at least; explosives despite being empty of anything but a table, three chairs, and some open unfilled crates. ""This is where Alan Brown sold his spices and arms...and this is where it all started....""

""Hmm?"" Now this Jazak could be excited about. As an enforcer for the Space Pact Alliance, and an antique weapons and military history enthusiast; Jeffy here was talking his language.

""It was here one fateful late Halloween evening after hosting the 100th Halloween Special in their theatre and beginning to indulge themselves at the spooky festivities in the nearby auditoriums, hallways, and food courts that the attendees and some of the traders who had stayed after closing shops came face to face with the Jee Jee.""

A jee jee girl in the youth group looked around at her friends and just shrugged her scaly shoulders.

""...Now, the Jee Jee are part of the alliance these days and have been for some times, but back in the day there was a bitter war between them and the Riashet....""

A riashet girl flipped her tail in mock provocation at the jee jee child, apparently friends.

""...Unfortunately, the war opened with shots taken from smuggled weapons at Riashet governor Zashu, and his wife Basa who was an ambassador to the alliance while they were attending the event. Basa survived as the shot missed her and struck a nearby party-goer, a human named Dave Mueller whom had seen the flash of a weapon and pushed her away; badly injuring himself in the process. Zashu was not so lucky and we have a memorial plaque on a wall in the food court we will be going to directly....""

""...Some of the station's guards had turned traitor and walked away after being bribed; leaving only a few stragglers to try to contain the chaos. You see, trade stations lacked fully automated weapon defenses back then due to risks associated with such at the time, relying mostly on guards and cameras for security. Alan Brown took matters into his own hands and led a group of men back to his shop to arm themselves as it soon became clear that the Jee Jee were making the rounds as part of a larger more spread out group and the two whom had fired at Zashu and Basa were trying to retreat back toward their companions. He and his small group were successful in killing all the invading jee jee, none of which had been willing to surrender and fought to the end, but it cost Alan his life. His memorial plaque is alongside the good governor's...."" 

A dark figure ran from the doorway of the trade shop to the crates, bent over them then stood back up and disappeared. Jazak's fur raised for the umpteenth time that afternoon. Just as he started to relax again, five more dark figures darted into the room and did the same as the first. The sound of explosions and gun fire rang out as they disappeared. Everyone but the tour guide jumped back and started to squeal and scream.

Jeffy straightened up. That was not supposed to happen, it is not part of the Hauntway Hub's computer program to allow weapon-related sounds during a tour despite the history of what happened here. There was a limit to how far Jeffy was willing to push guests, especially the very young and children, and great care had been taken in creating the appropriate protocols. What was going on? It has to be a glitch, he reasoned.

Another explosion rang out and children tried to run to the doorway, but the trade shop slammed its own metal door shut. The sound of an automated lock engaging met all ears. 

Tears ran from children's faces as Jeffy rushed over to a hidden wall panel and pulled it back, revealing a modern screen and console and began to type out a command into the interface. For once this whole afternoon, it was his turn to turn pale as he stood there silently looking at the computer.

Jazak moved to stand by his side. ""I think you need to tell us what this all about.""

Jeffy pulled him aside after glancing around the room. ""Jazak is it? I have heard of you.""

""Yes, I am an enforcer.""

In a whisper, the tour guide continued. ""The company ship you came in sir has been captured by pirates and they have just breached our main gate back at the docks. The computerized defense systems just shut us up in here to keep us out of harm's way but it will be a death trap if they fail.""

""What?!"", Jazak exclaimed in shock and anger before seeing Fenna who had been sitting on the floor comforting the children look up at him questioningly. Lowering his voice, he turned back to Jeffy. ""Mr. Brown, I'm sorry but what computerized defense systems? I am sure I heard you say the Hauntway Hub didn't have fully automated defenses.""

""Convergence Fairway Station didn't have them, but the Hauntway Hub does.""

""But why? This is a tourist location."" Jazak's brow went up.

""Well you see, Mr. Findley was always a cautious man but started to become increasingly paranoid after the incident with the Jee Jee. Making matters worse the station, which was also his home, came under attack several more times during the war. At one point it even doubled as a military base. Major reconstruction and upgrades were made during this time. I wasn't able to get to any of that in my story before our current situation happened. What I don't usually tell people is that the poor man kept upgrading it long after the war, to his considerable expense as business never really flourished afterwards.""

""So can the systems take them out?""

""That's the problem, while there has been some maintenance, they have not been fully activated in ages. The travel agency is more concerned about them activating at the wrong time than it is about if they can repel an intruder. So, your guess is as good as mine. I am just surprised they left the gun turrets and automatons.""

""Sweet heavens!"" Jazak didn't know if he should be extremely afraid, relieved, or excited. Those wonderful, crazy, frightening humans and their weapon tech and hyper vigilance. He would just have to put the best spin on it he could when the fireworks came and there was explaining to do to the kids and wifey. If they came out.

Jeffy frowned for just a moment. ""That is strange. There is another program running that shouldn't be. The theatre program 'This Is Halloween: Brutal Musical Revision Special #000'."" He brought up a camera display of the theatre room, only for nothing to be playing on stage. In fact, the strangest thing to Jazak was that it almost looked ordinary. 

It even now had normal lighting unlike the dim yellow prevalent everywhere before.

""So what does it do?""

The tour guide shrugged sheepishly. ""We have musicals and concerts here sometimes. But I have never seen this particular routine, it doesn't show up on the list of our specials. It must be a hidden entry but why?""

""You are the only person working here."", Jazak looked suspiciously at Jeffy.

""It doesn't always feel that way. Am I?"" Jeffy questioned.

""Oh yeah, I guess it doesn't. Just how much of your operation here is handled by computers?""

""Well if I am going to confess things, might as well do it during what may well be my last tour....""

Meanwhile:

The Bloodscale crew had more or less just plucked the company ship like it was a ripened fruit or flower, the pilot and stewardess being the only crew staffed on her. They were tied and locked up in a storage area after surrendering control of the vessel. The pirates would figure out what to do with them later. Interest turned once again toward the station, where their true prey awaited, and soon they found themselves shooting what appeared to be cameras and blowing up the main gate to gain access.

A tinny sounding human male voice came over a nearby comms. ""That was neither trick nor treat.""

The Bloodscale captain Has'vok the ""Blood Maw"" replied, ""And who are you?""

""You might just find out. This is Halloween, and you didn't even knock and say 'trick or treat'""

""And if I had?"", the captain asked sarcastically.

""I might have let you enjoy the festivities.""

""Looks like I don't need your permission. I will be joining you for some 'fun' anyways."", The captain sneered while his crew laughed.

""That will still be acceptable I assure you."", The voice remarked this time oddly coldly.

""Well boys, you heard the man. Lets go meet our host."" More laughter erupted from the boisterous crew.

They entered a long dimly lit hall as soon as they stepped out of the docks and into the trade station proper.

""Hey Captain, think we can get our helpful and so friendly host to show us were our hostages are? We will just have a party and leave,"" laughed a pirate.

The ""Blood Maw"" just let out a huff. The question got answered by someone else though.

***♫ Ladies and Gents of Every Race***

***Won't you accept my cold embrace?***

***Come this way, and you will see***

***A true host's grace on Hauntway Halloween ♫***

The Bloodscales stood there surprised for a moment before the captain and several pirates burst out laughing. Whoever was on the comms might not have been kidding. At least about the entertainment.

***♫ This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***Lost souls scream in the halls at night***

***This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***Join me for a music scene ♫***

Mechanical rumblings resounded from deeper in the station. What was that? Has'vok motioned for his crew to slow down and be cautious.

***♫ Trick with Treats***

***'Til you all dance for your lives***

***Treat with tricks***

***Then you all die in wondrous fright***

***Guided on Halloween to everlasting light ♫*** 

After walking a ways in silence for a bit, fans in a section several feet ahead kicked in; moving the scent of a cooked ham down the hall. Has'vok's first mate piped up with a hungry smirk,""Oh we know were someone is now, lets see what's cooking!"" He and four others ran into the entrance of a food court to get their treat and a presumptive hostage. He and four others found themselves treated to a barrage of bullets from turrets situated under guiding cameras. Five men down, and the ones behind them running back a distance to get out of range before a couple snipes took the cameras out. Now things were getting serious.

""Captain...a more cautious pirate spoke up. Why does a station this old have automated dense systems. We know from our data base that this one didn't host trade for long after the Riashet-Jee Jee conflict.

""Yes, and this is owned by a travel agency of all things. Lets move cautiously."" He looked up at the ceiling. ""Whoever is cooking in that food court is dying in there.""

Slowly they made their way into the food court, guns raised to take out anyone or anything. There was no one and nothing of note. Except a blasted ham set out on a table. 

Avoiding the likely poisonous temptation, they moved on.

***♫ See I am the one who gets in your head***

***Helps your beautiful nightmares get out of bed*** 

***See I am the one who stares wherever you hide***

***Ready to light up the shadow you can't long abide ♫***

What kind of joke is this? Some of my underlings now have competition for being demented, sick bastards.; The captain thought to himself.

Back at the tour guide:

""What the?! What am I listening to? Is this the mystery program?"" Jazak stepped back the screen and looked around at the scared faces of the kids and more than a few worried adults.

Sivix looked at him with big eyes. ""Is it the ghosts with the explosions?""

""No darling, that wasn't ghosts. There was an issue with one of the other doors. Jeffy here can see it all.""

""What about the song?"", one of the quieter youth shuddered.

""That appears to be some recording left over from the old days that is playing for reasons we don't know. We will figure out the glitch in the speaker system."", Jazak exclaimed like he was the most confident, and dependable of adults. Fenna and a couple of nearby adults shot him dirty looks while the young childless couples glanced at each other and back at him. He'd done wrong.

""Its a human ghost playing with the radio and singing. It is gonna get us in it's cold embrace! It's gonna eat us cold!"", Bobta cried and others soon started joining in on the wailing.

""If it is a ghost, it is probably just messing with us because it is Halloween."", a young woman said soothingly. ""Think about it, this has to be the best time to be a ghost. You can prank and aggravate with no regard all you want on your holiday! Gotta live it up sometime if you are gonna stick around.""

This was something to ponder and at least some of the whimpering went down. An embarrassed Jazak was glad to be nudged by Jeffy. ""What is it?""

Jeffy looked at him excitedly., ""I think I know what that program is doing. I just don't know why this particular musical."" 

Jazak raised an eyebrow, a shared expression between his kind and humans.

""Here, let me show you."" Jeffy pulled up a map showing the trade station, with an overlay display. ""You can see here were it is pinging the changing locations of the pirates, and you can see here where a defense turret just went off and eliminated some signatures near one of the first food courts.""

Jazak's mood lightened considerably. At least some of the weapons worked. ""What's this up here?""

""That is what is exciting. One of our food service programs activated at the same time as the weapon defense and mystery programs, and all are running alongside the hologram program we use for tours and other services. The hologram program initially went offline as it should in an emergency when the gate was blown up only to come back up with everything else.""

""So there is actually an extremely elaborate defense protocol running somewhere hidden, just like our little speaker friend.""

""Correct, it even turned on a microwave in the rear-most food court where we have our current food supplies and blew air from that area into the food court were the turrets went off. Then it accessed hologram image files for food and activated the emitters.""

""That seems too intelligent almost it. Too devious. Everything it is doing is psychological warfare up until the moment someone is lured into biting a bullet. What really matters though is so far it seems to be on our side."" It was then that the two of them realized they had attracted young ears that had silently listened nearby.

Helck shouted, ""That's the best ghost! Kicking pirates around on Halloween! Can we all see?!""

Now there would be some explaining to do. Jazak and Jeffy looked at each other. Might as well, another cat out the bag.

The Bloodscale Raiders:

""Captain, I think I heard some shouting-"", a pirate was interrupted by comms.   

***♫ This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween ♫*** 

""Yes, I heard it to. But I want to get rid of this pest. I couldn't see the speakers to shoot them if I tried."", 'Blood Maw' squinted in the now extremely dimmed light. ""I am going to kill the first human I see regardless of who is doing this. Why it always them when you want to feck around?""

***♫In this place, that I call home***

***Everyone must dance to the Hauntway song***

***In this place, aren't things just swell***

***Everyone waits for the next big spell***

***You look for me the man***

***To catch my slight of hand***

***Not knowing I pounce at will, you shalt*** 

***most certainly shrill♫***

""No idea Sir."", his new First Mate responded. He jumped back as a bullet flew by his ear, having just barely caught the blinking of a red camera light in time. ""I know it is risky but I think we need our flashlights.""

""You all can as will I. This place seems to change the lighting at will."" Has'vok reached for his light. Turning it on he shone it straight into the face of a pale-gowned human woman. Shots went out all around him, but the human just stared at him emotionlessly before disappearing in her own flash of light. Moans and loud whines could be heard beside him. His new First Mate had been shot dead by friendly fire and another pirate was laying wounded on the ground. Curses.

***♫ This is Hauntway Halloween***

***Shadowed 'n' grim, barely lit to be dim***

***Are you afraid yet?***

***Well, for you that's my kind of fine ♫***

The captain had had enough. ""I am Bloodscale captain Has'vok the ""Blood Maw"". Come on out and face us yourself you coward! You have done nothing but hide behind your 'tricks n' treats' this whole raid!""

***♫ Say it once for me***

***Say it twice for me***

***You rolled the dice, you took your chance***

***Now spirits in the dark of night make you prance***

***Everybody scream***

***Everybody sing ♫***

""I will get you eventually. Then you'll pay for the lives of my crew. I am going to string you up by the time this over.""

***♫In this place called Hauntway Hub***

***I am the one who knows it, bub***

***In the corner of your eye then I am gone***

***Happy to make you and yours pay to atone***

***Getting cursed everytime you're in a bout***

***Just more music from your wicked spout***

***Filling my long dead heart with such sweet song♫***

Back to the tour group:

Jeffy had slid open another, even larger hidden panel revealing a nice big screen monitor and a console interface that suspiciously looked to Fenna like one of the kid's game machines. If that was what it was, the kids were too invested on the live action game others were playing outside to bother with getting the tour guide to reveal his hidden collection. Most of the group was gathered around the large monitor like a group of football fans watching their team win, jumping up and throwing into the air what grasping appendages they happened to have as the computer telegraphed its moves and notified the audience of kills. The footage was thankfully very grainy due to the lighting conditions so there wasn't really any gore, and the ""ghost"" kills weren't even being show as anything but pixel art on the displayed map. If that was Jeffy's doing, she would need to thank him later. 

Text to speech appeared in one of the tabs on the side of the screen, allowing everyone to see the words of the mystery program's song as the room's speakers belted it out. Almost everyone broke out into sing-a-long.

***♫ This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween*** 

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween ♫***



***♫ My untender mercy is everywhere***

***Life is better with the right kind of scare***

***That is my job, even if I have to be mean***

***On this night of Hauntingway Halloween ♫***

To the Bloodscale:

The group of ten raiders stumbled back outside of the auditorium, cursing their way out. A group of what appeared to be children inside gave way to smoke, and when that cleared another round of turret fire. Everytime they thought they heard a human or the tourist group in some random room, it was a trap. And that wasn't counting the strain all the moving shadows and all the flickering and brightness changes of lights was inflicting on them. The captain motioned to his men who turned to face him.

""There shouldn't be many places for them left. We have checked everywhere but the theatre and a couple shops. I have a map both in my head memorized and stuck in my pocket. We'll check the theatre first as it is closest."" They stealthily inched their toward their target location, coming to a stop before reaching the doorway. A theatre could be a real show. They stepped inside and waited, scanning the area and listening for sounds before  proceeding, but even the back stage and dressing rooms were empty. The captain was filled with an irrational feeling of that somehow being wrong, giving the area one more look-over before carefully leaving.

The mechanical sounds in the background that had been their constant companion seemed to grow even louder, and one could make out the sounds of wheels, gears, and levers moving.

 ***♫ In this place***

***Don't you love it now?***

***Everyone's waiting for the next big reveal***

***And I must always bring the deal***

***They will glean from me***

***When they no longer see***

***Me making you scream, me ending your dream ♫***

The sound of growls and the clicking of claws on hard flooring echoed behind them. The faster they moved, the faster whatever it was behind them ran. The last of their wits were gone as they succumbed to full-blown panic. They ran. Through smoke, turret shots, wall-mounted flame throwers....

***♫ This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***Time to scream ♫***

The voice snapped them to their senses and when he came to, the ""Blood Maw"" was down to seven crewmen and couldn't make out where he was. Everywhere he turned, there were dark hallways branching off somewhere. It seemed like endless stretches into eternity. It didn't make any sense. The mechanical sounds soon began to thunder and the bloodscale could make out the bare edges of forms moving toward them down each hall. This was really it, huh? It wasn't just going to be that way though, they would die shooting. Bloodscale Captain Has'vok the ""Blood Maw"" raised his weapon as did his remaining crew. Not out of any sense of duty or honor, just spite. Spite that they were dying, picked off one-by-one. Spite that they had not murdered the Enforcer and his wife, who were responsible for their old captain's imprisonment. Spite that they could not use any of that family or the other hostages as leverage to secure his release. And in that moment more than anything, spite that they could not find a single human to tear apart in this human-made, human-owned, and human-operated hellhole. There was nothing but feck around and find out. 

The pirates screamed like feral beasts as what could now be observed to be white cloaked figures in black robes came into range and proceeded to fire whatever weapon they still had functional into them. Lead, lasers, and plasma weapons firing off in in every direction as they were slowly surrounded. The figures came to a sudden stop, seemingly impervious to the weapon fire. Soon there was nothing left to shoot with as every bullet and every laser and plasma charge had been depleted. 

Both the Bloodscale Raiders and Tourist Group:

The figures circled the pirates, with each successive wave lining up down the hallways. There in the central, circular connecting room of the station, they moved in unison as if unified by a single mind and single will. Slowly arms raised in the air, and then in one fluid motion flung off the cloaks and pulled back the hoods on every single being all at the same time. Greeting all were the emotionless faces of automatons. The Bloodscales' spite had surely been wasted just as much their blood. The pirates collapsed defeated in despair, a pride before a fall.

Jazak, seeing only about twenty on the big monitor as opposed to what had to be about a hundred holographic ""reflections"" was much more amazed. So intent on what was infront of them, everyone in the safe shop room; as well as those collapsed in what now had to be the most 'unsafe' room in the whole trade station was started by the sound of speakers. Only this time, the now familiar human voice came not only from the station, but from the robots as well. There was a full-blown choir of copy-cats available in addition to all the singing children in the shop room.

***♫ Won't you please make way for a very special truth***

***Our man Mr. Findley is your host so true***

***A confession from the ghost in a machine, to give you spooks ♫***



***♫ This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***This is Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween***

***Haunt-oh-ween ♫***



***♫ In this place***

***Possessed machines call home***

***Everyone sings Mr. Findley's song ♫***



***♫ La-la-la-la-la-la, Haunt-oh-ween***

***La-la-la-la-la-la, Haunt-oh-ween***

***La-la-la-la-la-la, Halloween***

***La-la-la-la-la-la, Halloween ♫*** 

Blazing gun fire bounced off every wall as every single one of Mr. Findley's playthings fired.

Jazak and the others walked out of Hauntway Hub and into a different company ship. The other one was still being inspected and its crew treated for what were likely minor though rough injuries. In a matter of hours they would be safe at home, away from anymore pirates who might hold a grudge against them. He clutched a contact card in the palm of his hand from Jeffy, the old man having made himself a friend. Somehow, he had the odd sense to not only look up and wave goodbye once again to Jeffy, but to the trade hub itself. Crazy old Findley might not have left anything more of himself behind when he died than an equally absurd and insane automated obsolete space station, but it still felt like there was something alive. Like just a bit of his person was somehow alive in there. Or maybe the wifey was correct, and somehow the ""Enforcer"" of the alliance really was just a big romantic.

Jeffy and ""Findley"":

""You know, I have long had the feeling that this is more than just a hologram of you. And that you stuck around somehow and after playing so much with your playthings, developed a taste for mine."", Jeffy chuckled to the hologram of Mr. Findley while fiddling with some of the gadgets in the trade hub the travel agency didn't need to know about and would be gone come next inspection. The video games, a few select software programs, and some minor gadgets of course. The weapons though were still all Findley. 

""You especially like my software. Can't say I blame you. Fair is fair.""

A certain kindred spirit stood content watching. Moving to the hologram, the machine emitting it, and everywhere in between. True is true, and indeed fair is fair. A life is lived in many different ways. And by the looks of it, Jeffy, an elderly man would soon understand. Just as would the others drawn to the station. ""Until then, dear friends.""

Jeffy looked up for just a moment, saw nothing and shrugged. Just another one of those feelings. ",0,1730435933.0,HFY,3,0.5,False

1ggxl3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ggxl3g/the_woman_of_my_dreams/,The Woman of my Dreams,"For the past few weeks, I have been seeing a woman in my dreams. She is beautiful and lovely in every way. I've always been a lonely man, never having much luck with women, and I’ve always been antisocial, never going out much. At first, when I began dreaming of her, it felt like magic—like my dreams were another world where I finally had someone.



I almost preferred sleep over the real world. 



Every night, she would appear. We would meet in different places—sometimes a quiet meadow under the stars, other times in a small, cozy room that felt like home, even though I’d never seen it before. She never spoke, but she didn’t need to. Her presence was enough. It was like she knew me, understood me in a way no one ever had. The way she looked at me with those deep, mesmerizing eyes made me feel like I mattered. Like I wasn’t alone anymore.



I started going to bed earlier, eager to see her again, to escape into that perfect world where she waited for me. It was intoxicating, the way she made me feel wanted. It wasn’t long before I found myself longing for sleep more than the waking hours. The loneliness that had haunted me for so long started to fade, replaced by the comfort of her presence in my dreams.



But then, things began to change. Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first.



A few nights ago, something changed. Something felt off about the woman, though I couldn’t place exactly what it was. She looked the same—still as beautiful, still as perfect—but her silence became cold. Her gaze, the one that once made me feel seen and understood, now felt different. Sinister, somehow. It wasn’t obvious at first. Anyone else might have seen her expression as friendly, even inviting, but there was something lurking behind her eyes.



My gut told me there was more to her. Something dark. Something evil.



I tried to brush it off, telling myself I was just overthinking it. After all, it was just a dream, right? But that feeling... that creeping sense of dread... it wouldn’t go away. It clung to me, even after I woke up, like a shadow following me through the day. It was subtle, almost like a whisper, but I could feel it growing.



Whatever she was, whatever she had become, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was no longer safe with her.



For the first time in weeks, as I lay down to sleep, I hoped I wouldn’t dream of her. That sense of anticipation I once had was gone, replaced by a quiet dread. But as sleep came, I was back with the woman. This time, we were in a vast garden, flowers blooming everywhere, the scent of jasmine heavy in the air. She beckoned me to follow her, and for a moment, I had forgotten my fears.



But as I walked behind her, that same creeping sense of dread began to return. Something wasn’t right about her anymore. Her smile was too wide, her stare too piercing, like some kind of predator that had its prey in sight, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.



As we wandered through the garden, the scenery around us began to shift. The vibrant flowers wilted, the sky darkened, and the once tranquil air became heavy, oppressive. My heart raced as I realized that this wasn’t just a dream—it was something far more dangerous. My suspicions were confirmed when I tried to wake myself. Have you ever had one of those nightmares where you know you’re dreaming but can’t wake up? It was exactly like that.



Panic set in. I struggled to pull myself out of the dream, but the more I tried, the more I felt her eyes on me, sharp and knowing. She seemed to sense what I was doing. Her movements quickened, and she came toward me, her smile never fading, but I could feel a dark intensity behind it. She wanted to keep me there, trapped with her.



I woke up just before she could reach me, my heart pounding in my chest. That smile of hers never left her face, but beneath it, I sensed a frustration—a quiet fury that chilled me to the bone.



After that last dream, I knew I couldn’t let myself fall asleep again. I stayed awake the entire next day, forcing myself to keep going, no matter how tired I felt. I drank more coffee than I ever had in my life, paced around my apartment, and tried to distract myself with anything I could think of. Anything to avoid seeing her again. Every time I closed my eyes, even for a second, I could feel her presence waiting for me. 



But no one can fight sleep forever. Eventually, the exhaustion caught up with me. I passed out while watching TV, unable to fight it any longer.



As soon as I drifted off, I was back in that strange world. And she was there, waiting for me. But this time, something about her was different—worse. Her form was distorted now, though still somehow beautiful, but in a way that made my skin crawl. It was like staring at something that shouldn’t exist, something both human and not. Her movements were too fluid, her limbs too long, her smile stretched too wide. 



That familiar sense of dread returned, stronger than ever before. Every instinct I had screamed for me to run, to get away from her. But I couldn’t move. My legs were frozen, my body paralyzed with fear as she drew closer, her eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my blood run cold.



I tried to wake up again, but this time, it wasn’t working. No matter how hard I struggled, I couldn’t pull myself out of the dream. The woman was getting closer, her eyes fixed on me with that same cold hunger. I felt my body tremble with fear, but I couldn’t move. I was trapped, just like before.



Then, before I could react, she was there. Her arms wrapped around me, pulling me into a tight embrace. At first, I didn’t know what to do. It was like everything inside me froze. Her body pressed against mine, but instead of warmth, I felt only cold. A deep, lifeless chill that seeped into my bones. 



Her grip tightened, and I could feel the strength behind it—far more than any human should have. It was crushing, squeezing the air out of my lungs. I tried to push her away, but I was powerless. The harder she squeezed, the more I struggled to breathe. My chest burned, and panic filled me as I realized I couldn’t get free.



I gasped for air, but nothing came.



I woke up on my couch, gasping for air. My lungs felt like they were on fire, and my chest ached from the pressure. It took me a few seconds to realize where I was, still dazed and half lost in the nightmare. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what had just happened. 



Maybe it was sleep apnea, I thought. Maybe that’s why I couldn’t breathe in the dream—my body must have struggled for air, and my mind reflected it. It made sense, or at least it was the only explanation that didn’t make me feel like I was losing it. I told myself it was all just a coincidence. 



But later in the day, something else happened. As I was getting dressed, I felt a stinging on my back. When I went to check it out in the mirror, I saw it—scratch marks. Thin, red lines running down my back, like someone had clawed at me. I was confused, staring at them in disbelief. Maybe it was the couch, I thought. Maybe I shifted in my sleep, and something on the fabric scraped me.



Still, I couldn’t shake the idea that somehow… she did this. It sounded insane, I knew that. But every time I looked at those marks, I felt a cold, creeping fear in the back of my mind.



I knew I couldn’t go back to sleep—not after that. I had to figure out how to stop dreaming of her. But how? How do you control something as unpredictable as your dreams? I felt helpless, but I couldn’t just sit back and wait for her to come back. 



So I did the only thing I could think of. I researched. I spent hours scouring forums, reading articles, and watching videos about dream control. That’s when I learned about lucid dreaming—being aware that you’re dreaming while it’s happening. It sounded impossible, like something out of a movie, but some people swore by it. They claimed that, with enough practice, you could shape your dreams, even banish nightmares.



It was my only hope. If I could become aware that I was dreaming, maybe I could stop her. Maybe I could finally escape.



I looked up methods for practicing lucid dreaming and decided to give it a try. I spent hours meditating, focusing on her, picturing her face, and telling myself over and over that I would banish her from my dreams. I needed to be in control. Slowly, exhaustion overtook me, and I drifted off to sleep.



There she was again, standing in the same haunting silence, beckoning me to come closer. But this time, I knew I couldn’t. I planted my feet, forcing myself to stay where I was. I had to control my dreams. I screamed at her, telling her to go away. She stood still, staring at me, as if contemplating my defiance. Her smile, the one that had always been present, slowly began to fade, replaced by something far more chilling—an angered frown.



Without a word, she turned away and walked into the shadows. For a moment, I thought I’d won. She wasn’t there anymore. I continued to dream, but as the minutes passed, I started to lose control. The awareness that I was dreaming began to slip away, and I forgot I was even asleep.



That’s when it happened.



I was walking through a bright, bustling city, full of people. Everything felt warm and peaceful. But as I turned a corner, I bumped into her. She was different this time—her form even more twisted and sinister. Her long arms were tipped with sharp claws, and her once-perfect face was distorted into something far more terrifying. 



She reached out for me, and I tried to run, but it was too late. Her claws dug into my skin, slashing across my face. The burning pain was unbearable, and as the world around me faded to darkness, I heard her scream—a sound that wasn’t human, an unnatural, monstrous wail that echoed in my ears.



Then I woke up, my heart pounding, the pain from her claws still fresh in my mind.



I went straight to the bathroom, desperate to shake off the remnants of the nightmare. But when I looked in the mirror, I froze. There, on my face, were the claw marks—thin, jagged lines that trailed across my cheek. My heart sank at the sight. This wasn’t just a dream anymore. Somehow, she had reached through my nightmares and left a mark on me in the real world.



I couldn’t deny it any longer—she meant to hurt me, and she could. It seemed impossible. How could something from a dream do this? But the scratches were there, raw and real, staring back at me in the reflection. My mind raced with questions, but there were no answers. All I knew was that if I went back to sleep, she’d come for me again.



I stayed awake for three days straight after that, pushing my body to its limits. I tried everything—coffee, loud TV, pacing the floor, anything to keep my eyes open. But no one can outrun exhaustion forever. I could feel it creeping in, weighing down my limbs, clouding my thoughts. I knew it wouldn’t be long until I passed out, no matter how much I tried to fight it.



And when that happened, I knew she’d be waiting.



I wanted so badly to stay awake. Every fiber of my being dreaded the thought of what else might happen to me if I slept. But no matter how much I fought it, exhaustion finally won. I passed out.



This time, the moment I saw her, I didn’t hesitate. I ran. She gave chase, her voice echoing in the distance, but it wasn’t a scream this time—it was worse. It was a garbled mess of sounds, like she was trying to talk to me but couldn’t make out the words. It was twisted, unnatural, and filled with something far more terrifying than just anger. I kept running, my legs burning, my lungs aching, but she was faster. 



She caught up to me. Her hands gripped me, cold and unrelenting, and she turned me to face her. I couldn’t believe what I saw. The woman I had once thought so beautiful now looked monstrous. Her smile stretched wide, filled with jagged teeth, and her once perfect eyes were now sunken and dark, as if hollowed out by something evil.



Then, she kissed me.



It wasn’t like anything I had ever felt. It was as if she was sucking the life out of me, draining everything I had. I could feel my energy slipping away, my body weakening, as her lips pressed against mine. It felt like dying.



And then, just as the darkness started to consume me, I woke up, my heart pounding, my chest heaving as I gasped for air.



I lay in bed for a while, tears welling in my eyes. How could my dreams turn against me so violently? How could that woman, once so sweet, so beautiful, become this nightmare—a monster that was hurting me? It didn’t make any sense. The fear I felt was unbearable, and the line between reality and my dreams seemed to blur more with each passing night.



Eventually, I got up to go to the bathroom, my body weak, trembling. After using the toilet, I splashed some cold water on my face, hoping it would ground me, bring me some sense of peace. The water felt serene, cool and comforting. I clung to the sensation, relishing the simple relief of being awake, of being safe in the real world where she couldn’t reach me.



I let out a deep breath, relieved. But as I dried my face with the towel and looked up into the mirror, my heart stopped.



There she was. Standing behind me in the dimly lit corridor of my hallway, her twisted form barely visible in the shadows.

Up to 8 years ago, I was in perfect health. 8 years ago I bought scented candles for the first time, those triggered terrible dry cough. I did not realize right away so that went over 8months. Since then I have been extremely ""sensitive"". Any scented product will either give me a sore throat, a lump feeling in the throat or a cough. The ""dust"" coming out of clean clothes (washed with unscented detergent) will make me sneeze and my respiratory track just kinda feel more sensitive. My body also got extremely more sensitive, I can't use makeup or anything scented anymore. I started having allergic reactions to ibuprofen out of the blue (swollen throat and swollen tongue that would last for a month after I took a couple pills, that also went on for 2 years because the doctors had no idea what it could be).

I also always have a constant dry nose/back of throat and for up to 2 years after the covid vaccine, I had incredibly dry eyes but that passed. It can get so bad it bleeds but most of the time it's just uncomfortable. Humidifier and saline spray don't really do anything. I have seen an ENT and multiple doctors, including allergies and some other specialists for hormones, and nothing really shows. But the ENT said it looked like I had overall dryness and that my nose was very very dry. Since a few years I had to completely stop coffee, even decaf was making my throat so dry it would feel like needles poking at it.

I have been trying to drink a lot more water but it almost seems to make it worst. Pedialyte is the only thing that helps short term.

I started Vyvanse 3 month ago and it really amplify the existing issue. A month ago I started having this really bad cough out of sudden. I was only able to get rid of it with pedialyte and gatorade but it is back since I stopped those.

I feel like it cant be normal to be constantly ""dehydrated"". Is there anything I can have checked? I just feel like the smallest trigger creates a abnormal reaction for my body. For now I stopped the vyvanse because I can tell it is making things a lot lot worst but I really need that medicine as I am not only taking it for adhd. Any ideas of things to get checked would be highly appreciated.

1ggxkfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/1ggxkfi/reality_of_an_nri_teenager_1_festivities/,Reality of an NRI teenager #1: Festivities,"The 5:30 am alarm jolts me awake, but the sky is still dark as midnight, a stark difference from that back home. I fumble around in the darkness, throwing off my covers trying to reach for my phone to open the calendar. It said: ""October 31: Halloween; DC Chemistry: Homework and Lab due; Deepawali."" Diwali, I remind myself, half-asleep. But then the reality sets in—no holiday, no diyas to light, no firecrackers, no huge rangolis outside the main door, and no one calling my name from outside.

I drag myself to the bathroom, take a shower, hoping it will wake me up. Nothing new to wear, no kurta-pajama or those new Indo-Western outfits on the rise. Just the usual: jeans, hoodie, and sneakers. In Delhi, I’d be pulling on my kurta and pressing my hands against my reflection in the mirror, admiring the intricate embroidery on the fabric. The memory feels like it’s slipping away, just out of reach. Mom’s in the kitchen, staring at her phone, her expression distant. She glances up when I walk in. “Happy Diwali,” she says, almost like she’s forgotten herself. I mumble it back, more out of habit than anything else. I grab a cup of coffee and a granola bar lying on the counter—no jalebis, no ladoos. Back home, my aunts and neighbors would come by with plates of sweets, stacking them on the counter until the entire kitchen smelled like cardamom and rosewater. Here, there’s just… granola.

I hop on the bus to school at 6:30 am, the sky still dark as it was when I woke up. A strange silence shivers me from within; I'm used to it, though. Being Halloween today, the houses are decorated with pumpkins and props of ghosts and other paranormal figures. I feel a pang in my chest. There are no clay diyas, no marigolds draped over doorways, no aunties outside creating rangolis. Just me and my AirPods playing CAS to comfort me amidst the lonesome environment.

School is the same as always, hallways filled with kids chatting, laughing, and complaining about their teachers and homework. I sit through history, chemistry, computer science, precalculus, English, and physics, staring at the clock as it drags on. A few people around me wished Diwali, but I don't think they know what Diwali really is. It's not just a festival, it's a symbol of community too, something lacking in the individualistic American lifestyle.

I feel invisible as if all the colors of the festival—from the rangolis to people's outfits to the firecrackers—have drained from me, leaving me washed out. 

I got home at three in the afternoon. Dad has work from home on Thursdays, so he was at home today; Mom is still at work, though. ""Happy Diwali,"" I say as I kick off my shoes and head off to my room. I go to my room, shutting the door softly behind me. Outside, everything is quiet.

I lie down on my bed and open Google Photos to reminisce the memories of what used to be the best days in my life. Without knowing what to do, I keep scrolling down on pictures of me in India, living life as a happier person. The thoughts overwhelmed me, and with no one to reach out to, I shed some tears and cried myself to sleep.

I went to a very small, potluck in the evening. The people already living here for years are used to the feeling of missing Diwali and other festivities so they're kind of happy with what they have. Mind you, I don't live in NY, London, or Sydney; I live in Houston, Texas, with a rather smaller Indian population than those other cities so there's nothing like y'all see on IG reels. 

I realized I chose this lifestyle for myself and I had the option to stay back and enjoy, but y'know, the grass is always greener on the other side, and I have to deal with it till the end of college, after which I could decide if I should stick to this country or return back to my country.",2,1730435444.0,IndianTeenagers,5,0.75,False

So I know this might be a silly question but long story short, my grandma was really scared of the dentist so she didn’t take my mom ever and it made my mom scared of the dentist so she didn’t take me growing up and I had no idea about anything dental hygiene wise. And as I was growing up my favorite candy was peppermints and I use to eat them all the time (also wasn’t aware that peppermint destroys enamel) and when I turned 18 I was dropped by my parents insurance and couldn’t afford dental care and I also had to stay home and care for my dad full time who had stage 4 cancer. Now as a 25 year old I am now working and can finally afford to go but my teeth are absolutely destroyed. Huge cavities especially in my front teeth which makes me extremely insecure as well as my own dental phobia passed down through generational trauma. 


And now I’m scared I’m gonna go to the dentist and he’s gonna see my teeth and call the cops and they will take me to the psych ward. I’m not sure why I’m scared of this (I had to go into one a few months ago due to actually cutting myself and needing stitches which I’ve stopped doing btw) and i guess I’m scared of it because I’m afraid it’s seen as a form of self harm? Is this something I should be afraid of? Or something that can even happen? I take good care of my teeth now I floss with regular floss and I use a water flosser in the mornings and I have an electrical toothbrush but it unfortunately doesn’t undo any damage already caused. I also would like to add I have never smoked anything and I don’t drink. I’ve also cut out soda from my diet and I only drink coffee through a straw and try my best to avoid it touching my teeth ",3,1730435425.0,PsychWardChronicles,2,1.0,False

Edit: I added a bit of my perspective to compare with your answers! 

1. Are house parties really a thing? Do teens not go to clubs and bars? Is faking your ID a common thing? (Nightlife as a minor is so different! Nightclubs check ID sometimes, but a lot of them are +16. Bars and supermarkets have never asked!)
2. Is eating in your car a usual thing? (Drive thru here is more of a it's 3 am and I'm hungry situation)
3. Can news channels be poIiticalIy aligned (thinking about fox news)? (Journalism being anything but unbiased weirds me out, especially with the amount of misinformed citizens, I feel like it's dishonest?)
5. Are frat houses as Hollywood portrays them? Dudebros and kegs? What do people do in a fraternity? (We don't have fraternities but we have really deep academic traditions and hazing groups with stupid hierarchies, I think over here it just takes a more traditional route. For example, we use academic robes (think harry potter) while hazing first years and we can't use any type of jewelry or makeup since they symbolize equality between peers (a bit bs if u ask me but))
6. Are the senior high school proms really made in the gym? For all the importance high school seems to have in the American culture (the diploma ceremony, sports, school spirit) I always thought that was uncharacteristically underwhelming (from most answers I gather it depends on school funds, since its organized by the student body the cost is divided per student and the school has nothing to do with our prom here! They wouldn't let us do in school even if we wanted to)
7. Can you get fined for jaywalking? 
8. Is smoking cigarettes more rare/are vapes more common nowadays? (Vapes haven't really caught on here. And smoking is as stereotypical European as it gets, I guess)
9. Can teachers give you detention? À là breakfast club, after hours? (This one is wild to me! I don't think teachers here are made to be figures of authority in the way they do in the states)
10. Do people drink expressos as rarely as tv makes it seem? If I think of coffee and america I think of a giant mug. (Lattes and such are at least, a 15 minute sit down situation for me. Having it to go makes me feel like I'm wasting money so espressos are quick and do what needs to be done. They're also typical and what I grew up having)
12. Does every town have a newspaper/morning channel? 
13. Do waiters bring you a check without you asking/is it rude to stay at a table for as long as you want?
14. Are patriotic symbols really a thing? Like having the flag on your porch and singing the national anthem in primary school (the pledge of allegiance seems so dystopian to me! I thought the state and religion were totally separated)
15. Is being in debt a common thing? Can the average American afford college fees? (My law degree is 1600€ per year which is about two minimum wages)
16. Does everyone live near mountains? It seems like I hear Americans talk about going hiking like they're going to take a walk around the neighborhood. 
17. Do you have trains that take you from a state to another?
18. Is LA as influencer filled as it seems or is it fairly authentic compared to what is shown on the internet? (As usual I thought LA was much smaller than it actually is)
19. How much do the small towns in the south fit the redneck stereotype?
20. Are plastic and one time used utensils common in households?
21. Is Europe (western) romanticized?

Sorry I remembered one more — you don't have any type of national health service? If someone gets hurt or sick and is poor they just die? 


I just find the US so fascinating, because it's like a reality show, in a way? It seems like everything is broadcasted and I know so much about American culture like it's my own, but at the same time you're so far away physically it doesn't seem real. 

(I also obviously don't think the country is a monolith, the generalizing tone is more regarding to general social acceptance of the subject in question or how you personally view it)

Edit: honest thank you for putting up with so many questions! I live in Lisbon and it's so curious to see how we differ in things of our day to day lives!

I begin with a triggerwarning regarding suicide, mental health and bullying.

Well I am technically a widower even if we never married (marriage isn't that big of a deal here in Sweden) with two daughters now aged 12 and 14. The situation regarding their mother's death is that something happened, we don't know what and she got into a psychosis three years back and trashed our appartment before taking her own life, all while the kids were at home. The older one have had a real tough time with it as she got badly bullied at school as she was known as ""the daughter of the psycho"" while also dealing with the trauma as she did protect her little sister during the ordeal as i was at work when it happened

The problem now is that here in Sweden we don't celebrate Halloween that much yet, even if it is on uprising but on All Saint's Eve wish is tomorrow we light candles and place on the graves of our loved ones or in case you can't visit a grave, you place it in the Memorial Grove wish pretty much every cemetary have.  
My oldest daughter have said that htis year she doesn't want to light a candle for her mother as she doesn't deserve it of how she destroyed our lives and even said that she hates her. This in turn have sown some discord as the younger one want things as we have done every year and I don't know what to do. To emphasize how bad it is, the older one is usually pretty quiet and introverted like me, but regarding this she have had outburst of anger wish in turn upset the younger one. And I try to validate that none of them are in the wrong as both has the right to their feelings and have tried to meddle between them.

I want to clarify that she want to come with us to the cemetary as we have other graves to light a candle on to but not her mother.

So any tip is welcome on how to deal with it. I have had one thought and that is to save their mother's grave for last and that the older one go to the church as they are offering ""fika"" wish is coffee/tea/soda and cookies and we meet there after. For those wondering you can google Swedish fika to see what it is.

Something I have lifted withg her psychiatrist is also that when she feel that when and if she is ready that she and i shall go togheter to her mother's grave and that she can sort of tell her mother mother what she feel about her.
