1kcl3as,https://i.redd.it/llunibw9u8ye1.png,May 1st - May 7th Theme Week: Coffee Shops and Cafés!,"The theme for our very first theme week is **Coffee Shops and Cafés**! Since this is the first week I thought it would be fun to start off with a very classic and simple AU.

This is purely a for fun event that is meant to encourage the community to create, share their ideas, and show off the love for their characters. So if anyone likes the theme that was chosen and has got any ideas, I look forward to seeing what you share! If this month's prompt doesn't interest you there is no need to participate and I hope that next month's theme will.

Here are the **event guidelines!**

1. The fanwork can be *fanart, fanfictions, collages, edits, memes, playlists, videos* \- anything like that is allowed.
2. The fanwork must be related to this week's theme.
3. Late submissions are allowed till the end of May.
4. It is up to each individual on how to interpret the theme, who to write about (ships or individual characters), the genre, the rating, and the number of fanworks shared.
5. The fanwork can either be a new work made specifically for this theme week or it can be an old work that happens to fits the theme.
6. Everyone must share their fanworks (either directly or a link to it) in the comments below.
7. Follow the sub rules and give proper warnings if the content is NSFW, contains commonly known triggers, or contains other archival warning type of content.

Also, I wanted to add some completely optional, more specific ideas and prompts for anyone who might struggle with broad themes.

* Character A becomes a regular at the shop due to a particular barista
* Shop Owner/Tattoo Artist
* Character A always puts time aside during opening to make their favorite regular's coffee order
* Character A just got a new job at a coffee shop. But they definitely wouldn't have taken it if they knew Character B would also be working here",1,1746137312.0,ShipsofRuneterra,0,1.0,False
1kcl2gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/boyfriends/comments/1kcl2gm/did_i_21_f_cheat_on_my_bf_22_m/,Did I (21 F) cheat on my bf (22 M)?,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt no sadness about that—he wasn’t important to me emotionally. I didn’t care about who he was as a person; I just needed someone’s attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Edited: this male friend never expressed romantic interest in me. Neither did I to him. Neither of us flirted with eachother or expressed romantic interest at all.",1,1746137248.0,boyfriends,1,1.0,False

1kcl1uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1kcl1uy/losing_my_best_friend_to_someone_else/,Losing my best friend to someone else,"Hey Guys, 

First time ever posting on here, just wanted to explain my situation a bit. My best friend and I have been inseperable for 10 years and it seems like every year we got closer and closer. We would do everything together and have the exact same interests. When we're together the people around us think we're speaking a different language because of our inside jokes and similar comedic timing. 

We have a close friend group of around 7/8 people, we're in our twenties all of us have decent jobs and love to go out together. Around 8 months ago a new member was introduced, it was my best friends sister ex boyfriend. To add context my best friends sister is also one of my closest friends as well.

We started seeing him more and more often, run into him at a bar downtown etc although we knew of each other we were never friends in the past. But this time it felt different, we started to bond over both  of us trying to get over someone we loved, for him it was my best friends sister. We realized we had a lot in common and he would constantly message and ask me to hang out. 

We became really close and in effect so did my best friend and him too, but as my best friend is in a relationship it was mostly just this new guy and I going out to the bars looking to find new love interests (we'd usually just get super drunk and just talk to each other about our ex's) 

After a couple months of this he became fully equated to our group and suddenly his energy around me started to change. Instead of asking me to hangout he would mostly just message my best friend and it felt like our dynamic completely changed. 

This person is very charming and started to essentially become my best friends ""yes man"" agree with everything he says, cheer for the same sports teams as him, match his gym schedule to his (he would do legs twice in a row just to workout with him) 

The two of them started to get closer and closer, and although yes I would always be invited the entire dynamic of of group but especially with my best friend changed.

The main pain point I felt is this person was trying too hard and I felt like he used me as a pawn to get closer to my best friend which had led to him getting closer to his ex (best friends sister) 

I distance myself from the group for a bit and everyone knew something was wrong, my best friend and I talk all time time mostly about our obscure spots interests and gambles and inside jokes, like I said we were very, very close. 

At my best friends birthday party I started to feel like an outsider, I had so much pain because it felt like the closest person in the world to me was slipping away. 

My best friend and his sister saw that and sat me down in a room alone and we talked for 2 hours in a middle of his party with 30 guests. I expressed my concerns about this new person, but they talked me out of it. Said I was wrong this person loves my friendship and I was the one that was pushing everyone away. 

I had never gone through this before so I agreed I was overreacting and tried to change my mindset on everything, which I did and for the next few weeks we were back to normal. 

But then again, I noticed despite my best efforts this persons level of ""trying to fit in"" with my best friend and his sister was just so over the top. The kids these days would call it ""dick riding"" he would agree with everything they would say, while disagree with everything I did. 

My best friend and I love to banter with each other, which I believe is something needed in male friendships, but every single time his personal cheerleader would just side with him. It grew tiresome. My best friend started to only go places if the new person was invited, never asked me to hang out alone anymore and it looks like he has replaced me. 

Again my actions changed, I tried to distance myself and the same thing happened my friends fought for me and my best friends sister and i went out for coffee. I expressed these concerns to her, that I was feeling these thing again, but it was ""you're overthinking"" this person cares about you a lot etc.

They blamed my drinking, smoking and overthinking, for the way I felt and again, I agreed and tried to mend the relationship again. 

We were literally family for 10 years with zero issues and the first time I expressed issues, I was told I was ""crazy"" and it looks like I have turned into the villian now. I hated myself, why did I feel these things as a man i needed to be stronger etc, those were things I felt internally until yesterday. 

Yesterday it got bad so I just googled ""best friend replacing me"" and i saw so many people share the same concerns of ""dynamic changing"" and abandoment issues etc. It made me feel so much better about myself, that I wasn't going crazy and I wasn't the person that was 100% in the wrong. 

This is main thing here, my friends can't seem to understand my perspective, they dont want to rationalize my thoughts. I skipped out on a hangout a few days ago and I can tell my best friend is just mad at me, he thinks I am pushing him away and thinks I don't care, but it's the opposite I am hurt and every time we're all together I get reminded that I dont get the same feeling anymore and it fucking hurts me. 

We built our relationship organically over years of love, going out, sharing moments, common interests and became family because of our connection. Where as I see this person with an ulterior motive, people in my secondary circle have echoed my thoughts as well, but in my main group I am viewed as a crazy person .

All i ever wanted was my best friend to see that I am going through something, call me, invite me out for dinner and just rationalize my thoughts and feelings. But it doesn't look like that going to happen, so I am deciding to just walk away, there's too much pain there even though my love for them will never go away. 

  
For me it's like working at a company for years, being the model employee and then getting demoted out of the blue and them expecting you to be completely fine with it.

Sorry for the rant, I just wanted to get stuff off my chest, thanks to anyone to read this and if you're going through something similar my dm's are always open.

So, I was thinking of forming a rather casual group, meeting every week (probably in a coffee shop, or a park) to discuss our favorite books and poems. Personally, I write poetry, so I was thinking we could share our poems and stories too! We could just write or read and hang out in the same room. 

The club would be for all ages, but I am a shy woman in my 20’s and have found it difficult to find people around my age who are creative and nostalgic and enjoy writing. It would be a welcoming space (LGBTQA+ safe); a chance to share our emotions and experiences through words. A place that fosters human connections and removes the barrier of worrying, “What do they think of me?” And especially, a place to make friends!

Two of us don’t have cars, I get driving anxiety, and the girl who drives is really comfortable with it. 

If we’re going on longer trips, we split gas evenly, but I never paid for gas otherwise. I figured that she would be going anyway and it doesn’t add expense to take the rest of us along. We all live under 10 min apart too so drop offs aren’t hard. But I recently realized that the two other girls have been sending a few bucks or buying her coffee every so often for driving all the time. And they were shocked that I wasn’t especially because we do go to the other side of town pretty often. Basically said it was an AH move of me. One of them commented that I probably owe a pretty large amount over the few years we’ve known each other.

That friend told the driving friend, who brushed it off and told her it’s fine, but that friend is now saying it’s because she is non-confrontational and I need to be paying without being asked. Now our dynamics in the group are very awkward and stressful.

I’m kind of taken aback with all of this because our friend has never once asked for gas money. Doesn’t even ask for parking but we automatically pay her for it. I know that she also makes more money than the rest of us and is very frugal so financially she’s in a good spot and does not need it. 

I didn’t really think it was necessary because she would be spending the gas money anyway even if we drove separately. And she’s made it clear she doesn’t need it. AITA for not offering to pay for gas?",1,1746136587.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False

I’m moving to Peoria soon for a new job and wanted to reach out before the move to start getting a feel for the community. My wife and I are excited to be leaving a more rural, isolating environment and are really looking forward to putting down roots somewhere that feels more aligned with our values.

I’d love to connect with people who are into:
	•	Tabletop RPGs (I’ve played and GMed a bunch—open to new systems or homebrew!)
	•	Local farmers markets, gardening, or homesteading projects
	•	Live music, art, or any low-key creative community stuff
	•	Progressive, open-minded spaces
	•	Cool bars, coffee shops, or just good people to share conversation with

If you’re part of a group, a game, a club, or just have a favorite spot to recommend, I’d genuinely appreciate the nudge. Always down to support local businesses, artists, or weird/beautiful things happening around town.

Thanks in advance and hope to meet some of you soon!",7,1746136457.0,PeoriaIL,3,1.0,False

Like whenever he thinks he was wrong done or something bad happens he says things that stick with me… everything seemed fine for years now we worked through the physical abuse and lack of communication, at least I thought so. Until he’s the one that’s angry, until he’s the one that’s hurt then constructive manners and things are out of hand. 

Anyways I’m trying to buy a flight tickets for a family event and it’s been challenging to include my partner because he has different schedules, I sat down today and was looking for flights and noticed I was searching the wrong airport, as I go to switch it he irks me by saying “you silly or dumb” something along does line and pointing at the thing I new I had to fix. Pointing and being belittled are also triggers of mine… I literally kept saying “stop, stop, stop stop please stop.” Because he kept putting his finger on the screen and was bothering me by trying to “show me” when I knew what I had to fix…. I loose it and finally start yelling “STOP STOP STOP” which I yelled loud more than 4 to 5 times which lets me know that he even then kept it up for a bit, he finally gets hurt because “ he was yelled at” stormed off to bathroom to get ready for work.  

I’m preparing his tea for work because he’s very anxious today so I was helping him have less coffee and take tea instead to work… he comes outside and I tell him I don’t appreciate the “crash out” he had and how he was literally talking and pointing over me begging him to stop… he says that he’s very hurt that I shouted at the top of my lungs and he sticks to his own and says that he doesn’t deserve to be yelled at I tell him that’s true and that I was very frustrated because he kept talking  and pointing in my face over me.. he then said what made me very scared

This family has been amazing from day 1, we have never had any issues, they trust me 1000% with their kiddo, if I’m there I can tell they have a sense of relief that they can go to work and not even worry about his happiness or safety. When I arrive he immediately says “goodbye mom, goodbye dad” and we go outside and play and he doesn’t ask for them all day long. I absolutely love him so much. Apparently after I leave for the day all he talks about is me and what we did that day. I’ve gotten multiple videos at dinner time of him saying “(my name) park fun! (My name) car yay! (My name) come tomorrow to play?” He’s the sweetest boy ever. Also the parents are the besttttt. Always offering me breakfast, coffee, lunch, make sure I’m all set for the day before they head out and always ask me if I’m comfortable doing things occasionally that are outside of my duties (example: one time they were running late and they couldn’t finish sweeping and mopping the floor and asked if I could do it one NK took a nap, of course I did it because it was quick and easy but they made sure I was 100% okay with it and also paid me extra that day.) Also, they just found out my birthday is on Monday, and I got there this morning and they had flowers for me, gift card to my favorite restaurant and a gift 😭 I didn’t ask for the day off, but they are giving me it off and paying me still 🥹 they’re the most down to earth people I’ve ever met and I love the relationship I have built with them that I literally dread the day I won’t be working with them anymore 😭 ",3,1746136396.0,NannyBreakRoom,0,1.0,False

As a petite woman, my stomach distends abnormally and feels sensitive, which has caused me a lot of body dysmorphia and low self-esteem throughout my teens and early adulthood. I’ve even suffered from eating disorders because I was too afraid to eat due to how badly my stomach protruded.

It’s not uncommon for me to take 1-1.5 weeks to “go.” When I do, my bowel movements are usually shockingly large, firm, and painful. (I apologize for being gross.) Afterward, I feel thin and light again, and my confidence returns.

I’ve always been pretty health-conscious from a young age. I eat a variety of food groups and avoid processed foods when possible. I drink a lot of water, kefir, green juice, and kombucha. My breakfast consists of coffee and oatmeal with berries, and I’ve recently started using chia seeds. I love nuts, dates, fruit and cheese. I often graze on natural snacks. Admittedly, for dinners, I tend to go carb-heavy with a serving of rice or bread since I don’t eat much during the day. I also like to enjoy eating out at restaurants a few times a week with my partner which i'm sure isn't great for my tummy. 

I’ve been more conscious about fiber intake this past month especially since joining the sub, but I still seem to be struggling with tummy issues. I’m hoping by keeping up with this subreddit and my own research, I can make adjustments to my diet and finally have consistent bowel movements, which would be a dream.

1kcknpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/applesucks/comments/1kcknpi/apple_are_a_design_company/,Apple are a Design Company,"I realised when I couldnt open the lid of my new Apple

I support computers for a living, and I manage the purchase of devices for staff, and the vendor agreements etc. and one day with thoughts of making it easier to support the Apple users AND the Dell laptop users - I decided to switch to an Apple device.

It arrived, I unboxed it - and then when I tried to open it - I couldnt.

I spent a few minutes wrestling with it, and then I realised that I had assumed that as with any PC laptop, I would put it down in front of me, with the company logo the right way up, but no - not in Apple land.

With an Apple laptop you put the laptop down in front of you with the Apple logo upside down, and then open it.

I was pondering that - while installing apps, and I realised something. Apples are not devices designed to be useful or helpful for you, they are designed to present that you are an apple user to everyone else.

The Apple logo is upside down when you open the device, because when you're sat in a San Francisco coffee shop with one, the logo is then the correct way up FOR EVERYONE WHO IS LOOKING AT YOU.

This truth I realised then runs through all their products.

The Apple Laptop I had, had a cold metal surface (designed to not have fingerprints) - again more about looks, but it was also razor thin, and quite literally sharp when ever you rested in on your knees.

There was something off about the keyboard (I already knew the mouse was off because of the lack of buttons and the fact is almost defiantly doesnt have anything to do with the shape of your hand) but the keyboard was off, and I realise it didnt slope - there was like zero attempt by Apple to make it feel comfortable or usable.

Apple I realise ARE a design company - But in the same way that you have those freakish uncomfortable MODERN ART type furniture, which look bizarre and might make the cover of a magazine - but you wouldnt want to sit on one.",1,1746136173.0,applesucks,5,0.57,False

Several months back because of his weight and a genetic history of heart problems, he had several full blockages to his heart and had to undergo surgery. It was a very revealing experience for him and since then he has been making an effort to lose weight. 

One of the biggest obstacles for him was soda. He is very addicted to caffeine and he admits he just likes flavor. Hes found coffee, flavored water, and sweet tea to be great alternatives. While he does still enjoy soda he has cut back significantly. Its also helped that myself and the rest of the family encourage him a lot. We make sure we point out when we notice hes lost weight. Ive pointed out that he seems to have more energy and is a lot happier. My dad has noticed all of this too and has been sticking with his diet changes as a result. 

Today, i was running a few errands with my dad and we were done and decided to pick up mcdonalds for lunch. The drive through was long and so my dad decided he would rather go inside and order carryout. So we go in and place our order. My dad aways orders a large soda with fast food, but today he thinks about it for a second and then decides not to do it as he has sweet tea at home. This was a first so i tell him im proud of him. 

Of course a boomer behind us has to ruin the moment and i hear him scoff. I turn around and look at the guy who is pretty fucking fat himself and he just starts talking nonsense about how my dad should order a soda and it wont really matter. I try telling him that he doesnt know that and boomer continues trying to argue like my dad not ordering a soda is a personal attack against him. Finally i get pissed off and say “My dad had some heart problems several months ago and has been trying to lose weight. Cutting back on soda is a big part of that. Maybe you need to cut back a bit too before you have a heart attack. You do seem to get upset pretty easily after all since a stranger not ordering a soda seems to set you off.” 

Boomer goes red and starts to sputter as we finish paying for our order and i just keep taunting him and tell him to order. After that he looks over at me while making his order so i see the calories listed and begin listing them out for the old guy after he says each menu item he wants. Got my order and left with the guy’s face so red his heart might have actually stopped for a bit. 

I really dont get why boomers feel the need to comment on other people’s food choices but hey if you want to do that then i can do it too and make you feel a lot worse for it",10,1746135857.0,BoomersBeingFools,1,1.0,False

	•	Full-body tingling (especially during episodes)
	•	Brain fog and difficulty concentrating
	•	Dizziness or a feeling of pre-syncope (like nearly fainting)
	•	Heat flashes and internal flushing
	•	Exhaustion from simple activities or after meals
	•	Cold sensitivity during flares; prefers lying under a blanket
	•	Shortness of breath or “heavy breathing” (not oxygen deprivation, but effortful)
	•	Post-meal crashes, especially in the afternoon

Patterns noticed:
	•	Symptoms often worsen after light meals or if a full lunch is skipped
	•	Fatigue and neurological symptoms improve after eating a balanced, substantial meal
	•	Snacking alone does not prevent crashes—needs protein + complex carbs
	•	Flares are sometimes triggered after naps, physical exertion, or stress
	•	Caffeine and alcohol worsen symptoms significantly (leading to crashes, tingling, fatigue)
	•	No significant heart rate or blood pressure fluctuations recorded during episodes
	•	Symptoms occur daily, but fluctuate in intensity and timing
	•	Symptoms are not pain-predominant, but involve major sensory and autonomic elements

This has been going on for 2 years now and every doctor shews me away. AI says it is most likely sfn, but my thing is my tingling/numbness usually starts in my stomach area then eventually gets to arms and legs and it’s only periodic throughout the day.

I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt no sadness about that—he wasn’t important to me emotionally. I didn’t care about him in a romantic way ; I just needed someone’s attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

This male friend never expressed romantic interest in me. Neither did I to him. Neither of us flirted with eachother or expressed romantic interest at all. ",1,1746135703.0,ROCD,0,1.0,False

1kckdle,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kckdle/does_the_keurig_ksupreme_plus_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Coffee Maker Truly Deliver? Review Inside!,"Testing the Keurig 5000350800 K-Supreme Plus Single Serve Coffee Maker was an experience I wasn't expecting to love this much, but here we are. This machine has a lot going for it, with some quirks along the way. Let’s get into it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The stainless steel exterior of this coffee maker instantly impressed me. It feels premium and fits perfectly into the modern aesthetic of my kitchen. The compact design—measuring 13.3""D x 8.3""W x 12.2""H—takes up minimal space on my countertop, which is a relief considering the currently limited real estate in my kitchen. The digital display screen is another sleek touch, simplifying the brewing process. However, I did notice that fingerprints smudge easily on the stainless steel. A quick wipe fixes it, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re obsessive about keeping surfaces spotless.

**Performance and Features**  
This machine is a powerhouse. The MultiStream Technology lives up to its promise of extracting more flavor and aroma with every brew. Compared to my old coffee maker, the difference in taste is undeniable—each cup feels richer and more aromatic. The option to choose between five brew sizes (4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 oz.) gives it an edge in versatility. I’ve been alternating between experimenting with hot coffee on colder days and iced coffee for refreshing afternoons, and those customizable strength and temperature settings have been a lifesaver. Not to mention, I don’t have to wait ages between cups thanks to its back-to-back brewing capability.

[Check Keurig 5000350800 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0892tyt2m/)

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker isn’t intimidating at all, which earns it a big thumbs-up from me. With labeled buttons and the ability to save brewing preferences for up to three users, it’s kind of like having a personal barista at home. Even my coffee-loving roommate has praised how simple it is to navigate after just a quick glance at the interface. But, the reusable filter can be tricky to clean after you’ve made your own ground coffee as opposed to using K-Cup pods. While it’s not a dealbreaker, the process requires a bit of extra effort, especially when rushing out for work in the morning.

**Strengths**  
- MultiStream Technology delivers robust and flavorful coffee.  
- Customizable brewing settings for strength and temperature.  
- Programmable favorites—perfect for multi-user households.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Fingerprint smudges on the stainless steel exterior require frequent cleaning.  
- Reusable coffee filter is slightly finicky post-use.  

**Functional Capacity**  
This coffee maker boasts a massive 78 oz. removable water reservoir. Trust me, you’ll appreciate not having to refill the tank constantly. On busy days, brewing up to nine cups without stopping to fill the tank is a true blessing. I even found the removable reservoir easy to handle for refills, though some users might find it a bit bulky depending on kitchen layout.

**Other Options**  
For those considering alternatives, the Nespresso Vertuo Next and Breville Bambino Plus are popular rivals. The Vertuo Next delivers a consistent crema for espresso lovers, but it doesn’t allow for the same degree of customization as the Keurig. The Bambino Plus, on the other hand, is better suited for making barista-quality espresso but comes with more bells and whistles that might intimidate casual coffee drinkers. Overall, the Keurig K-Supreme Plus hits a nice middle ground between simplicity and sophistication.

**Value for Money**  
Looking at the feature set—MultiStream Technology, customizable brewing settings, and the sheer number of brewing sizes—this coffee maker offers a solid balance of quality and utility. While it isn’t the most budget-friendly, its efficient performance and durability give it serious staying power. Whether you’re a coffee connoisseur or simply in it for a quick caffeine fix, this feels like a smart investment.

1kckddo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kckddo/cannibalisticautocannibalistic_urges/,cannibalistic/auto-cannibalistic urges,"hiya, i have cannibalistic urges, mainly auto-cannibalistic ones and i don't really know what should i do. in complete honesty - it doesn't really bother me that much yet i know this isn't really normal either

i like the thought of eating someone - especially their organs and it's one of my fantasies to have someone who would let me taste their flesh. even more i like to imagine myself being eaten, which is something that's been on my mind for a long time. at first i simply ate my skin or intentionally hurt myself to drink my blood but it quickly stopped being enough, so i decided to do something more

thus, one day i took a razor blade and just cut out a piece of my flesh. there was a lot of blood and i messed up part of this piece, so i had to eat it raw (i think i also ate some of my skin nerves?? or whatever those things were!) but the other part of it was alright, so i fried it, added to my scrambled eggs and then ate, while drinking a coffee with a bit of dish soap

while i am somewhat aware that this is a bit weird, i can't look at this as something completely abnormal or bad - i don't regret it and would love to do it again. and like i said before it doesn't really bother me. yet i wonder sometimes; what if i got drunk or high? would i lose control and eat someone? or what if i started to eat more and more of my flesh, reaching the point where i wouldn't be able to stop?

well, those are just silly thoughts and i'm rather sure that none of them will happen! but i still don't know what should i do or where did those urges came from",1,1746135424.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I suck at drawing.","The winter of 2019 came early, Simon was hoping to move everyone across the mountains before it came... But, winter hit just after Halloween. They moved into the remains of an amusement park that was abandoned in 2008 after the House Market collapsed, the Wall Street War, The 2 Year Famine, and the 2nd Great Depression started. The winter winds blew the snow all over the mountains, the snowfall seemed to be alive and trying to kill the large group of civilians, former soldiers, and convicts. Simon and Bishop kicked down doors throughout the former circus of steel, wood, and asphalt moving the pregnant women and children in with makeshift fire pits and enough food. The soldiers maintained a perimeter in the cold, layering animal pelts over their old uniforms from 2 now dead nations. Convicts set up a Meth lab nearby to the front gate, these Cons were either imprisoned 1%er bikers or white supremacists who knew how to cook this stuff. ""Old school biker crank, not that shit the cartels were pushing. No, no, this is the good American made meth from the 70s."" One of the cooks would say whenever Simon would pick up his daily dose. The combo of Meth, Whiskey, Cigarettes, and salted squirrel meat didn't affect Simon as much. It only suppressed his appetite and helped him ignore the cold. He would use this time to look over the files. 

""Prætorian Virus Mutation."" He scoffed to himself while reading with his rifle by his side, ""Scientist estimate that those who survive being infected with the PVM will have enhanced stamina, enhanced strength, improved durability, higher testosterone, slightly heightened senses, and a growth in muscle mass. We recommend the move to younger (prepubescent or atleast early adolescent) test subjects."" Simon closed the file, showing the Eagle crest of the United People’s Democratic Republic of America. Underneath he had doodled a skull, without its bottom jaw, with out stretched wings akin to the SPQR Eagle's wings, with a barbed wire wreath around it and a crown on the skull. Underneath it he scribbled, ""Undying Eagle."" 

He looked up to see his girlfriend, or fiancee, he wasn't sure yet, walking over with a mug of hot coffee for him. As his fingers touched her's to take it from him, he kissed her. His scar on his lips was still fresh and when he pursed his lips to kiss her, he broke a few of the stitches. She reached up to his 6 foot 4 inch tall frame to use her sleeve to dab away the blood oozing from Simon’s face, ""Thank you, Riley,"" he lifted the mug, ""and thank you for the coffee."" 

""You are welcome, Simon, I'll go see if there's any string we can use to fix that."" How Riley said that and how she smiled at him reinforced that she was deeply in love with him. Simon chuckled with his deep voice and smiled back, ""Fixing my face has turned you into quite the seamstress!"" The sound of thundersnow broke through the mountains but how Simon snapped up his rifle and pointed it to the sky, it might as well been a F-4 Phantom breaking the sound barrier before raining napalm on them all.

The final five have returned from the runway show, and each of them truly shined on that runway! The bottom three were photographed backstage while getting ready, and they’ve chosen their favorite beauty shots for the public to rank from best to worst. Each of these three competitors is desperately hoping to succeed in the bottom three challenge and be granted immunity. With the end so close, none of them want to be the first to leave Tokyo, drawing that fifth-place curtain call. Lily looks both defeated and heartbroken as she sips her sake and smokes cigarettes with Freja on the balcony of their luxury suite.

""I think I’m going home next, girl,"" Lily murmurs before taking another sip of sake. ""I want to believe I’ll stay, but I just can’t shake this feeling—it’s not going to happen. This is my third time in a row in the bottom three. My chances of staying are fading unless I pull off a huge comeback with the beauty shot, but Iris had a really cute backstage beauty shot. I honestly think she could win the immunity challenge. I’ll be shocked if I win over her. Her shot was really editorial.""

""Yeah, she had a fantastic shot, but yours is truly breathtaking too,"" Freja replied with conviction. ""You could win immunity, and even if you don't win, I genuinely believe you'll beat Missy if it comes down to the bottom two. I can see you beating Iris too. Don’t forget, Missy has been in the bottom three just as many times as you. Just because she’s had some first callouts doesn’t mean she’s safe this week. I can see her leaving soon. I think her peak was the beach shoot.""

""Maybe she’s peaked already and maybe I have as well. Maybe she'll be spared instead of me and go home next week but it won't matter by then cause I'll be gone. I haven’t had any first callouts,"" Lily sobbed softly. ""I honestly feel I deserved at least two! My high points have only been second callouts.""

But Freja’s eyes sparkled with encouragement. ""Your moment could be next week. You’re going to get through this week, and you’ll shine in the final four and final three. I really want you in the finale with me.""

A wavering voice, filled with longing and doubt, escaped Lily. ""I am improving, but I don’t know if I’m enough. I want to be getting better and doing well, but I keep landing in the bottom three. It's so frustrating. Ever since I was in the bottom two with Edita at final seven, I’ve been holding onto hope that the two weeks after that would be my breakthrough, my shining moments. But I keep flopping, even though I believe my photos are strong.""

Freja’s voice grew gentle but firm, filled with faith. ""You’re going to make it, Lily. Your backstage beauty is proof, it's a strong shot—and you’re a fighter and you have shown time and again that you’re a force to be reckoned with even when you've been in the bottom three. You won immunity last week and you will win immunity this week. Yes, you’re the underdog now but America loves an incredible underdog story. Redemption is coming. I believe you can win immunity again, just like last week. Your backstage beauty shot is strong too."" Freja reached out and put her arm on Lily's shoulder, her eyes glowing with conviction. ""You are gorgeous, fierce, and unstoppable. We’ll make it to the end together.""

Tears welled in Lily’s eyes, and her voice was warm with gratitude. ""You’re a wonderful friend. Thank you for being here for me."" Freja’s smile was bright and reassuring. ""Of course. It's going to be okay.""

Elsewhere, Maria, Iris, and Missy were gathered in the dining area of their luxurious suite, sipping sake and delicate Japanese green tea. A sense of unease lingered in the air as they reflected on the runway show that had recently unfolded. Their expressions conveyed a mix of hope and dread, particularly on the faces of Iris and Missy, who were both up for elimination.

""I truly hope Lily goes home tomorrow,"" Iris said. ""She’s not part of the first callout club, and I honestly don’t see her ever joining us. We’ve experienced incredible highs, and she just hasn’t. Second callout is not a high; it's second best. Only first place is the incredible high. It’s time for her to go.""

Missy nodded in agreement. ""I agree. She’s not as strong a model as you or me, so I think we’re safe. She’s also not as strong as you, Maria, or even Freja. I’m so tired of her getting spared every week since we reached the final seven. She’s been in the bottom three for three weeks in a row—she needs to be eliminated already. It's frustrating how she keeps managing to stay in the competition. She’ll probably make it this week too, ugh, but I hope not. She's really irritating. Since her first bottom three appearance, she’s been miserable, sulking around. She seems defeated now, even though she’s still trying somewhat. Honestly, I think she’s sabotaging herself. She never expected to fall so low after those first weeks—she strutted around the house like she owned it, acting like she was the star while we were beneath her. She thought she would get a first callout when I did for the beach challenge, but instead, she ended up in the bottom three and has stayed there ever since. Honestly, she’s turning into Crystal 2.0.""

""It’s definitely time for Lily to leave,"" Iris said. ""She’s had some great photos, but being in the bottom three three weeks in a row is pretty bad. I know you’ve been in the bottom three three times as well, but not three weeks in a row. If Lily survives this week, I bet she’ll end up going home next week. Maybe she’ll end up like Crystal, with four bottom three appearances in a row and get eliminated on her fourth time. She should go this week, not next. I really want us three to stay in this competition until the end—final three, all together—that’s my goal. We’re the strongest three here.""

Missy agreed. ""I want it to be us three too. We’re the strongest, and I truly believe that. Freja’s had some bright moments and a first callout, but I don’t think she’s as strong as us three. Lily should go home this week, Freja next, and then it’s us—the final three in the end. That’s how I hope it will be.""

""Then two of us would be in the final two. I really want that for us—to be in the final three together and have two of us in the final two,"" Maria said.

""But maybe the final three will go to the finale,"" Iris added.

""There could be one more non-elimination round at that stage."" ""I hope so. I would love for us to be there together in week ten, with one of us winning. We’re the best three left in this competition,"" Maria said softly, her voice filled with hope for her friends to make it to week eight with her. ""I truly believe you two will make it through this round. You ladies are strong models.""

""You’re an incredible model, Maria. I genuinely believe you’re destined for the final two. You are my strongest competition, and I love your portfolio; it's amazing. Anyone would be lucky to have you front their high-end A-list fashion campaign. You’re so talented, Maria,"" Iris said, her voice filled with sincerity and a flicker of admiration.

""Thank you, I really appreciate that. You’re an incredible model too, Iris,"" Maria replied warmly. ""Your backstage shot is absolutely stunning. I bet you'll win immunity with that shot. You also have one of my favorite portfolios in this competition. I loved your business and rock 'n' roll shots so much!""

""Thank you, Maria. That means so much to me. I knew when we started this competition that you would be going to the end,"" said Iris.

""That's funny cause I felt the same way about you. I knew you would be a strong competitor right away,"" said Maria. ""And you have been throughout this entire competition. I wasn't wrong and neither were you.""

A tender smile blossomed on both Iris and Maria's faces as they exchanged compliments, but Missy’s eyes shimmered with a quiet ache—a deep, pounding loneliness that no outward expression could conceal. Her heart ached as she watched them, their words weaving a tapestry of admiration that seemed just beyond her reach. She looked away, her gaze drifting elsewhere, feeling invisible amid their shared joy. In that fleeting silence, Missy’s mind wandered, lost in a whirl of longing and unspoken emotions, yearning to be seen and cherished amid their warmth. I*ris didn't think she was going home since this was her first time in the bottom three. I know Iris and Maria have been getting closer recently, but Maria is my roommate, and we share a close bond too. I'm also close with Iris, but now it seems that's not the case. I bet they want to go to the final two together with me as the third-place girl, and now I feel like the third wheel in this trio. I bet Maria would rather I go home instead of Iris if it came down to it. They think they’re stronger models than I am, and they've barely said a word about my backstage beauty.*

Suddenly, Missy looked at her friends, a flicker of frustration blazing in her eyes. Her heart was heavy with unspoken emotions that threatened to overwhelm her. She turned to Maria, who finally caught her gaze after exchanging more compliments with Iris—words meant for each other, not for her, as if she didn’t exist in their universe. An undeniable tension filled the air. ""So Maria, what did you think of my backstage beauty shot? Tell me,"" Missy’s voice quivered, her frustration spilling over, raw and undeniable. ""You haven't really said anything about it yet, just that I should be in the final three. What about my backstage beauty this week? Is mine amazing too?""

Maria took a deep, trembling breath, struggling to hold herself together, then offered a forced, strained smile. ""Missy, your backstage beauty shot had 2000s energy. Lily's was pretty basic. Your makeup was very much 2000s.""

""What do you think of my backstage beauty shot, Iris?"" asked Missy. Iris hesitated for a moment before speaking.

""Uh, yeah. Your shot, Missy… it was really interesting. I liked it. We did well. Our twin shots definitely outshined Lily’s. Hers was too pretty and simple. I think Lily's going home next.""

""Yeah, for sure, Lily’s on her way out,"" Maria chimed in, a hint of nervousness creeping into her tone. ""Her beauty shot was really gorgeous, but it's basic.""

Missy, eyes rolling slightly, pressed gently but firmly, ""You guys can just tell me the truth. What do you really think of my backstage beauty shot?""

Iris locked eyes with her for a moment, then took a deep breath. Her words were cautious but sincere. ""It was good, but honestly, I wasn’t a big fan of the raccoon eyes, and I'm not sure if everyone else will be either. It was just too much eyeliner. Sorry. It was a choice.""

A flicker of irritation crossed Missy’s face. ""Oh, okay. I was doing edgy—something different with a bit of 2000s flair and an editorial style. The designer let us have our makeup done however we wanted because he thought that would be unique for the show, and I went for that specific 2000s look. I think it's great!""

Iris tried to soften her tone. ""I’m sure some people loved it. The 2000s vibe is back, right? It was popular in Y2K and the mid-2000s.""

Missy looked hurt. ""Well, you ladies don’t love my shot. You’re supposed to be my best friends here.""

""I’m just being honest, Missy. Your backstage beauty shot wasn't my favorite. Sorry. You did really well at the twins shoot, though, so I think you’ll be fine this week. You’re still in the final four, in my opinion,"" Iris reassured her.

Missy’s shoulders sagged slightly, her voice soft with vulnerability. ""Honesty is important, I know. It just stings that you girls didn’t love my backstage shot, especially since I feel like I did my best. It’s hard to hear from you two that I may have done the worst in the bottom three challenge.""

""Well, we didn't say that specifically,"" Maria said quickly. ""Yours is different, and different can be great!""

""You don't have to say it,"" Missy replied sadly. ""I can tell you both think I did the worst. It's okay.""

Iris looked at Missy sincerely. ""Well, you did better than Lily at the twins shoot. I believe you’re still in the game. But I’ve got to be honest—your over the top raccoon eye makeup might cost you immunity, so you'll probably be in the bottom two. It wasn’t the best look. Sorry.""

Missy’s eyes flashed with defensiveness. ""Okay well that was my artistic choice—I wanted to be edgy and do a throwback to the 2000s. The designer let us do our own makeup, and I stand by that look! It's gothic and emo.""

""You're overwhelmed and stressed, Missy. I feel it too—this weight pressing down on us, exhausting us. Being in the bottom three is terrifying. But for the rest of the evening let's just try to have some fun and stop thinking about it. Let's find some peace amidst this storm. Let's hold on to hope and joy and drown out the stress for a little while. Please, let’s try to relax and truly enjoy ourselves for the rest of tonight. I'll get us some more tea and sake if you ladies want any,"" said Iris, getting up.

""Sure, sounds good,"" said Maria. ""That’s a good idea. It's been a long day. We need to just relax.""

""I agree,"" said Missy flatly. Missy’s heart pounded with anxiety, her confidence trembling like a fragile flame flickering in the wind. Iris went to the kitchen to get more sake and tea, while Maria headed to the bathroom. Missy found herself sitting alone, lost in thought once again. Then a haunting thought took hold—*what if America feels the same way that Iris and Maria do about my backstage beauty shot?* The fear sliced through her, sharp and relentless as the possibility of losing immunity loomed over her like a shadow. She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself with reassuring thoughts about this potential scenario. *Well if I end up in bottom two I will probably be saved. Hopefully if I'm bottom then Lily's bottom two with me and not Iris. I think I can beat Lily this week. God I'm scared if I'm in the bottom two with Iris I am going home. She is a very strong competitor. I can see Iris and Maria together at the end with one of them winning*.

As dawn broke and night surrendered to the bright promise of morning, the models began to stir, each preparing for the elimination ceremony. Even though Maria was safe she felt sad that she could potentially lose one of her close friends Iris or Missy. Freja was worried for her bestie Lily. The bottom three were feeling very anxious and nervous and rightfully so. One of them would be gone within hours.

The breakfast table was heavy with silence, an unspoken tension hanging thick in the air. Yet, Maria’s heart burned with a fierce desire to ignite a spark—her voice tinged with warmth and genuine passion as she shared her love for the city’s heartbeat and the incredible flavors of the its food. She hoped to lift the spirits around her, to remind everyone of how incredible Tokyo has been. Iris sat quietly, her mind echoing with chaos, stress and doubt. However when Maria’s enthusiasm reached her, something inside softened. She responded, her voice fragile yet determined, seeking to connect amidst the turmoil.

""I really love the sushi here. It's so yummy,"" said Iris.

""I agree, it's incredible,"" said Maria.

""I loved the tempura rolls from the restaurant the other night, they were my favorite,"" said Iris.

Freja and Lily remained silent, their faces veiled in quiet contemplation while Missy sat alone in the corner, her features shadowed with disappointment, clutching her coffee as if it were a shield against the world.

Lily noticed Missy sulking at the corner of the table and hesitantly but sincerely asked. “Are you okay, Missy? You seem really down.”

Missy’s response was heavy with vulnerability. “No, I’m not okay,” she admitted, her words trembling with the weight of her emotions.

Lily’s eyes filled with fear as she spoke, her voice wavering. “It’s so intense being at the bottom right now. I’m terrified I might have to go home today.”

Missy glared at Lily. “I hope it’s you and not me,” she stated flatly.

Lily's patience snapped, and her tone turned icy. “Okay, I’m done talking to you,” she said, turning away, frustration bubbling just beneath the surface.

Missy’s voice sharpened, bitter and defensive. “I didn’t want you to talk to me anyway. You’re just a fake mean girl pretending to be something you’re not. I'm not buying the nice girl act you're putting on now. It's all for the cameras. The real you is the mean bitch from those first five weeks.”

Lily, wounded but determined to improve, responded with quiet resolve. “I’m trying to be better. I was genuinely trying to be kind to you but if that’s not what you want, I’ll stop.”

Missy’s glare burned with intense anger as she retorted, “That sounds just great.” Her eyes sparkled with defiance, a silent challenge flickering fiercely in her gaze. Lily turned away, her mind heavy with stress, desperately seeking solace in a quiet conversation with Freja about the looming elimination, holding onto hope with every fiber of her being that she would be granted immunity and be able to continue in this brutal competition. ""I really hope Missy goes home,"" Lily whispered urgently into Freja's ear. ""She's an absolute asshole and I have more potential.""

""I agree with you,"" said Freja.

Missy could hear their words, but she chose not to respond. Instead, she merely rolled her eyes and then got up abruptly, walking away.

Soon Lindsay's voice was heard on the intercom telling the models to report to the grand ballroom at the high rise. The models made their way to the grand ballroom where they were greeted by Lindsay who was dressed in a cute psychedelic Anna Sui ensemble. Her hair was pin straight and she had a glowy peachy makeup look. She looked like a high fashion hippie. The safe models gathered in the safe zone near the wall on Lindsay's left. The bottom three stood on the elevated platforms across the runway from Lindsay who was at the center of the room between the two grand windows. ""Welcome ladies to the elimination ceremony. The votes are in for backstage beauty and we are about to find out who's going to win immunity from elimination. Will the bottom three please step forward?"" The bottom three move over to Lindsay and stand before her. ""One of you got a 1.25, the other a 2.00 and last place is 2.75. So who got the 1.25 score and will win immunity? Before that let's take a look at the statistics for this week's twins photoshoot."" There is a large tv screen mounted on the wall to the right of Lindsay at the center of the room. The models and Lindsay turned their attention to the screen. ""Here's the results for feminine vibe."" Feminine vibe is revealed on the screen.

Feminine vibe -

1. Maria - 1.66
2. Freja - 2.66
3. Iris - 3.16
4. Lily - 3.66
5. Missy - 3.83

""And here's the results for Masculine vibe.""

Masculine vibe -

1. Freja - 2.00
2. Iris - 2.50
3. Maria - 2.66
4. Lily - 3.83
5. Missy - 4.00

""And here's the results for feminine twin and masculine twin together. This ranking was based on who's the most believable to least believable as twins.""

Twins -

1. Maria - 2.50
2. Freja - 2.33
3. Iris - 2.83
4. Lily - 3.50
5. Missy - 3.83

Missy's heart sank as she watched the results be revealed. *It's not looking good for me. I think I'm screwed*.

""And here's the final ranking based on the three overall callout average scores combined.""

Feminine vibe, Masculine vibe, Twins combined -

1. Maria - 6.82
2. Freja - 6.99
3. Iris - 8.49
4. Lily - 10.99
5. Missy - 11.66

Lindsay looks at the bottom three intensely. ""So one of you is going to be spared right now. I have two backstage beauty photos in my hands. This first photo represents the model who's getting immunity this week."" Lindsay pauses and takes a deep breath before revealing the photo.

""Lily, you’ve once again secured immunity for a second consecutive week. Congratulations! You're still in the race to become the winner of *House of Modeling* and you’re in the final four."" Lily clasps her hands over her mouth, her eyes wide with disbelief, a mix of awe and gratitude flooding her heart. As she steps forward to Lindsay to accept her picture, she is overwhelmed by emotion. Behind her, Missy is seen slightly rolling her eyes, but Lily’s focus is solely on the moment. She locks eyes with Lindsay, a newfound determination shining through. 

""Lily, you need to step it up at the photoshoot next week,"" Lindsay urges warmly but firmly. ""Do something truly brilliant. You still have time to get that first callout. I believe in you, so good luck next week."" 

""Thank you,"" Lily replies with a fierce, unwavering resolve. ""This is my last time in the bottom three. I’m going to get a first callout."" Her voice is filled with determination, her heart set on proving herself. 

""I hope so,"" Lindsay responds softly. ""You have all the potential in the world, and you were soaring in the top half during those first four weeks. Don't let yourself end up int the bottom three four weeks in a row like Crystal."" 

""I won't get four bottom three appearances in a row. Next week, I promise — I’m getting that first callout,"" Lily declares boldly. With gratitude, she thanks Lindsay, takes her photo with pride and moves to the safe zone. There, she is warmly embraced by Freja, a spark of hope igniting within her as she steps closer to her dream of winning this competition becoming a reality.

Lindsay turned to the bottom two, her voice heavy with emotion. Iris gently took Missy's hand, a look of sadness passing between them. ""So we've seen the callout order and I think we all know who's going home."" Lindsay revealed the final picture. ""Iris, you're safe. Your overall score—combining photoshoot callout average scores and backstage beauty—is 11.00. Missy, your total is 13.25."" 

Iris feels an overwhelming wave of sadness knowing Missy is leaving, yet a flicker of relief washes over her for having been saved. She embraces Missy briefly before stepping forward to accept her picture from Lindsay. Missy looks down at the floor, her shoulders trembling slightly as Lindsay gently hands Iris her photo. 

""You are stunning, Iris,"" Lindsay says passionately. ""You’re in the final four — you are a truly strong competitor. But I want you to please not become the girl who shined so brightly throughout only to falter overseas. I am expecting yet another first callout from you, lady.""

""I'm going to do better next week,"" Iris says softly, tears welling in her eyes. ""I don't want to be in the bottom three ever again. I will achieve another first callout.""

""Good luck next week, Iris. And congratulations again — you're still in the running."" Iris moves to the safe zone where Maria warmly embraces her. Lindsay then takes Missy's hands but Missy’s gaze remains fixed on the floor as tears finally escape and trail down her face.

""Missy, you're a strong model... look at me, Missy,"" Lindsay insists, her voice filled with a gentle firmness. Missy lifts her chin and meets Lindsay’s gaze. ""You are a wonderful, talented model,"" Lindsay continues passionately. ""You’re the only other person here besides Maria who’s scored two first callouts. I’m truly sad to see you go. I believed you’d go further in this competition — you have so much potential. But I think the inconsistency in your callout order held you back. Even with two first callouts, you also found yourself in the bottom three—not just once or twice but three times. If only you'd maintained more consistency I believe you could have made it to the final two. Your highs have been extraordinary and you should be proud of what you've achieved. I will miss you so much.""

Missy’s voice trembles as she replies, ""I'll miss you, too, Lindsay. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. It’s been quite a rollercoaster but truly an incredible journey.""

Lindsay pulls Missy into a heartfelt hug as they share their bittersweet goodbyes. Missy then approaches the other models, offering a quick farewell — except to Lily whom she chooses to ignore entirely.

Back in the luxury suite Missy begins packing her bags, the weight of the experience sinking in. She later steps into the lobby of the opulent high-rise for an interview with the producer. Her voice is filled with honest emotion. ""I really hope Iris or Maria wins this,"" she says softly. ""They're the best models left, and I wish I could have been in the final three with them. It hurts that I had three bottom three appearances — even with two first callouts, that really hurt my chances. But I’m proud of myself for being part of the first callout club. I’m going to keep pursuing modeling work, because even though I didn’t win this game, it’s not the end of my journey of becoming a supermodel.""

Soon, a cab arrives. The driver helps Missy load her bags into the trunk and she steps inside the cab. The vehicle speeds away towards the airport where her ticket home awaits. As she gazes out the window, a mix of hope and bittersweet emotion fills her — ready to face whatever comes next, carrying the memories of this remarkable journey.

1kckb6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kckb6a/microwaving_older_beans_to_enhance_freshness/,"Microwaving older beans to enhance ""freshness""","Curious if anyone else has tried this - based mildly on the trend a few years ago of microwaving beans before grinding to reduce fines, I've tried a few times microwaving older beans to see if it improves their flavor.  My non-scientific consensus based on several times trying this, is that it really, really does help if you have some beans past their prime.

Case in point - someone gave me a bag of Stumptown Founder's blend that they hadn't opened, but with an expiration date a week in the past, so you know those beans were roasted probably 9 months ago or more.  I tried it, and there was a distinct flavor of ""old coffee"" that I usually associate with drinking pre-ground.    I made a couple cups on the Aiden, then stuck it in my lower coffee shelf and forgot about it.

Today I was feeling adventurous - keep in mind this bag has an expiration date of 12/27/24 - so I weighed out \~21 grams, spritzed it with my RDT atomizer, and then microwaved it on full power for 40 seconds.  I then immediately ground it in my K6.  

Surprisingly this tasted fresher now, then when I first tried the coffee back in January.  Like decent enough that I drank it black.  

So I encourage others to give this a shot if you have some coffee laying about that is past its prime - see what you think.  Obviously it's not going to be perfect, but I was pleasantly surprised by the result I got today.     ",3,1746135261.0,pourover,0,0.8,False

I’ve recently planned on moving out of the city in the upcoming fall but since I recently lost my job i’ve been very stressed out and have spent most of my time applying for jobs in person and online, as well as trying to find other ways to make money.  

My bf and I hung out last week and when I said I had to leave at 10:30PM he acted all sad and tried to guilt trip me and make me feel like I don’t spend enough time with him. Yesterday, we hung out for a few hours and I told him I had plans to meet with my friend (the one I am moving with) to discuss moving plans at around 9pm. He spent around half of the hangout whining about how I always cut our time short and we can never spend the day together. I explained life is busy and I don’t have the time to spend an entire DAY with anyone right now and he should enjoy the time we ARE spending together instead of ruining it but he didn’t like that. 

Today, we had plans to go Thrifting. He slept in two hours later than we originally planned to go. We rescheduled for a few hours later, and my mom suddenly  asked me if I wanted to go to a concert with her at 7pm and I said yes, because things have been very tense between us because of me moving and I want to improve our relationship. I told my bf this, but I told him we’d still have a few hours to thrift and I would treat us after to coffee and dessert but it wasn’t good enough. AITAH?",3,1746135062.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1kck75f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kck75f/my_experience_magnesium_ashwagandha_boron_iron/,"My experience - Magnesium, Ashwagandha, Boron, Iron, B-Vitamins, Zink, Fish-Oil, L-Theanine","Hey hey people! I read so many topics here about supplements when I researched what I should take. So I guess I can atleast provide some feedback on what worked for me and my ""needs"".

Magnesium:  
So in the past (years) I took Magnesiumoxide and citrate because I had regular muscle cramps - and it helped. If I didnt supplement it for a few days my cramps returned. So first takeaway: Magnesium is a god-tier supplement. It saved my ass. I cant count how often I woke up in the middle of the night to a cramp that was a 10/10 on my personal pain scale. It was hell. And 20 years ago when I was young and inexperienced I had no idea why it happened. Thankfully someone told me to take Magnesium.  
A few weeks ago I switched to Magesium-Bisglycinate (1500 - 300mg magnesium). Maybe that also helped with the benefits I will share later.  


Fish-Oil:  
I also take Fish-Oil regularly. Also for years already. Though I did not notice any positive or negative effects. My wife swears on it...so I guess I just take it because of her. And because everyone and their mother says Fishoil is magic. The only magic I notice was really bad tasting burps if I didnt drink enough when taking it.

  
Zinc (20mg):  
Then theres Zinc. I take 20mg daily usually. I started taking it because I have bacne and people (and studys) say its good for skin health). Not the worst bacne and not the mildest. My dermatist says its hormonal bacne and it will fix itself as I keep on aging. Thank you for nothing. Its not like im 20 anymore. I have a feeling Zinc helped my bacne a bit, but its far from cured. I tried so much stuff already. Not eating certain foods, BPO and all the other stuff you can apply on your skin...BPO helped, but as soon as I stopped it, bacne came back. So Zinc it is for now. If you have skin problems, try it...but dont expect wonders.  
\--

So now we come to the point a few weeks ago.   
First problem: I am very into fitness for some time. Mainly Running and Calisthenics. I thought why not look for stuff that might help my recovery, fitness and muscle gains? The worst problem was always recovery. After long and/or fast paced sessions I was dead. Also next day my performance and wellbeing was super low. Brainfog was an issue. Same with muscle recovery after doing my bodyweight stuff.   


Second problem: I always connected this to the first problem, but I guess its kinda a standalone thing. When I wake up in the ""morning"" (which is more like noon) I was always super tired. And I needed a few hours until I got going. I had this for so long I believed it to be normal and just my natural ""rhythm"", but when I thought about it, I thought that this should be fixable (without caffein! I quit that years ago as I dont tolerate it well and dont like the mild addiction that comes with it).

So my goal was to look for supplements to help me a) increase my workout performance. b) help my regeneration and c) help me be more fit in the mornings and after workouts and have less brainfog.

What I found was plenty. Some stuff I didnt try yet. Some stuff I cannot try as it is not available in my country. Some stuff I tried in the past and it didnt work for me (looking at you, creatine!).  
So I landed on a Vitamin B Complex, Ashwagandha, Boron, Iron and L-Theanine.

L-Theanine (200mg): I bought it for that ""Limitless"" focus of mind. Advertising said Id become that Zen Genius that would dodge bullets before they even got fired. And also Id be able to drink coffee without the jitters. Well, too bad I dont drink coffee. But I would settle for being a Zen Genius. Long story short: It did nothing for me, tried several times. Maybe I will try it again in a higher dose.

Boron (6mg): Heard it will raise my testosterone. And its pretty safe to take. So why not. I did not notice any effects yet, or have I? I guess I will stop taking it after it runs out and see if anything changes.

So now we come to the hot candidates, because spoiler alert: I have seen massive changes. Not massive massive, but noticable and I dont want to miss them. Let me first tell you why I bought that stuff.

Iron (20mg): I heard a shit load of people are Iron deficient. I heard runners like me tend to lose much Iron. And a symptom is fatigue (which I experienced often and thought it was the workouts). So I decided to give it a go. Just not too much because too much Iron is really bad. So 20mg (currently only 10mg daily) over a limited time are safe.

Vitamin B Complex (depending on the vitamin 100%-200% of recommended daily intake): I heard lacking some B Vitamins can give them symptoms I experience. So why not try it?

Ashwagandha (600mg KSM-66): Oh holy Ashwagandha. That stuff is advertised as some mythical shit. Sent by god to give you lean bodys full of testosterone, make you a Zen Master and a boner that will break rocks. BUT WAIT. Theres some unbelievers who must have an alliance with satan who blame Ashwagandha to make their cocks go limp and steal all their emotions. Well...sounds like an intersting substance, doesnt it?  
So I tried it and...  
\--

The benefits of Iron/Ashwa/Vitamin B: So the problem is: I started taking all the stuff at the same time and have no idea what exactly helped me. I believe it to be Vitamin B and Ashwa, but thats just a feeling. I did not have my blood checked.  
  
So what happened? Well, first off: I sleep like a stone. I always had good sleep and no trouble falling asleep. But now its even faster and deeper. Way, way deeper. When I learned lucid dreaming ages ago I conditioned myself to remember at least 2 or more dreams a night. Well, now I remember them without even trying. The dreams are kinda...uncomfortable though. Not nightmares, but not really feel good dreams. I believe that was always the case for me, but as I sleep deeper I ""feel"" them more, kinda. Can also have to do with the current issues I face in my private life. But hey, I wake up super refreshed every day nonetheless.  
Benefit 1: Way deeper and more refreshing sleep.

To go along with this is: I am way more awake in the mornings. I have way more energy. If it was a 3/10 before, its a 6/10 now. Its not perfect. But it feels SO much better. Maybe I will never be a morning person, but now I atleast feel like a human being.  
Benefit 2: Way more energy in the morning.

Next up is my libido. It changed slightly. I always had a super high sex drive. I believe it is reduced a bit. Could be a normal phase (I sometimes had phases with less libido). But I actually feel good like that. Its refreshing to not think so much about sex. I mean its still high but not too high. Did not notice any changes regarding my erection (which means its fine, though it doesnt break rock most of the time :/).

So no major benefit in that regard. Was fine before and is fine now.

  
So what about my fitness? Recovery, performance, testosterone? Testo, no idea obv. without a blood test. But damn son, recovery is done through the roof. That might also be connected to my way deeper sleep. I feel much fitter the day after a hard workout. My muscles seem to recover way faster. So much faster even that I can now train Calisthenics 5 days a week instead of 3. Also Running the day before does not impact my Calisthenics performance anymore in any major way. Previously I had real problems working out after a Long Run the day before because of a feeling like I was too exhausted still. Thats gone now. Even my wife noticed that I seem to have way more energy.   
So I guess performance also increased. Though not because I am suddenly stronger, but because I regenerate much faster/better.

Benefit 3: Way better regeneration and therefore energy and performance while working out.

Another change I noticed was that my mind sometimes seems a bit clearer when I am outside and I am a bit less restless. I was never super restless or anxious. People see me as someone very calm already. But I believe thats even more the case since I started taking this supplements. A few days ago I stood on the ferry I often take to get onto the other side of the river and I just was there in the moment for a minute. It was crazy. Just looking down the river and feeling alive and at peace with everything. Reminded me of my one time on 2.5g shrooms (I havent taken drugs in a long time!) when I felt at peace with everything and just enjoyed perceiving my surroundings. Havent had that feeling since then and I was really happy to feel so calm and one with the world around me again. If I had one wish I would wish for this state of mind 24/7.  


Benefit 4: Feeling a bit calmer.

So thats all the changes I noticed so far. I am not sure what supplement does it. But from what I read I believe it to be Ashwagandha that helps my sleep/regeneration and probably lowers my cortisol. And also I got a feeling the Vitamin B helps me. Dont ask me why, I might be imagining things.  
As I will discontinue Iron sooner or later I will see if it will make a difference then.

Shit, this got longer than expected. Hope you have fun reading it. Sorry for any mistakes, not a native english speaker.

  
TLDR: I believe Ashwagandha and Vitamin B Complex have a profound impact on my wellbeing. Better sleep, regeneration, state of mind and energy. Also, do take Magnesium. Especially if you deal with cramps.",1,1746134974.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

I have the **Deluxe beverage package** and I'm a big coffee lover. I’m familiar with the usual spots like **Café Promenade** or **Park Café**, where they serve **specialty coffee made to order by the crew**, just like at a real café (not automatic machines like Lavazza).

In the past, I used to visit the **Vitality Café** (in the Spa) a lot, where they made really good premium coffee. But I was disappointed on the **Allure of the Seas**, as **the Vitality Café is no longer there**.

So I’m asking:  


What other places on **Oasis class ships** (Symphony, Wonder, Harmony, etc.) have coffee **made by a barista**, not from an automatic machine?

I know **Starbucks is always excluded from the package**, but if there are any **bars or restaurants that prepare good specialty coffee**, even if it’s not heavily promoted, I would really appreciate it if you could share that info.

Thanks in advance for any help!",2,1746134908.0,royalcaribbean,2,1.0,False

1kck4ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1kck4ym/every_marketing_channel_sucks_right_now_i_will/,Every marketing channel sucks right now - I will not promote,"Sub won't let me include the link even though it's not mine (I will not promote smh), but the meat of the article below. It's Andrew Chen's. Does this seem like what you guys are experiencing?

Problem:

* **SEO**: Takes too long, you’re competing against listicles (and Reddit threads), Google might screw you over at any moment, maybe AI one boxing will kill your traffic next year anyway :(
* **Influencer marketing**: Get a big spike of traffic but none of it converts, the spike goes away after a few days, big creators are too expensive and a slew of small creators need to be cobbled together, lots of babysitting :(
* **PR/comms**: Doesn’t actually generate signups, doesn’t scale and not repeatable, expensive retainers for PR experts to grab coffee with journalists, your competitors will get the same article next month, and press is as likely to attack you as to cover you :(
* **Email marketing**: hope you like spam folders, building a good list takes forever, open rate rates are <30% and CTRs are <5% so hope you weren’t expecting a lot of clicks
* **Viral loops**: doh you need an actually great product, all the contacts spamming techniques no longer work (neither email nor SMS!), your UX will be ruined by aggressive popups and onboarding schemes, and it’s nearly impossible to get viral factor >1
* **Ads**: way too expensive, always getting more expensive, your competitors will just copy your copy, lots of fake/low-conversion clicks, your investors hate it, and it’ll kill you if you don’t have a strong business model already
* **Referral/affiliate/etc**: be ready for a crazy amount of fraud, it’s just as expensive as paid marketing (though people fool themselves into thinking it’s not paid), and surprisingly most people don’t care and will get fatigued quickly! :(
* **Big launch on social**: it can only happen once, you’ll have to spam all your friends to share and over time they might come to resent you, the algo is always working against you, and it only lasts for a few hours :(

Solutions:

* **Don’t focus on Big Channels, focus on Little Channels**. first, you should just know that all the aforementioned big, mature channels will suck for you. These channels have mostly all been bid up by bigger companies, and they are mostly stale to consumers, and you don’t have the same LTV and financial strength as an established product. Instead, a new startup has to be asymmetrical — what you can do that they can’t? The natural solution points towards Little Channels, which are all the smaller marketing strategies that are tried in the early days and abandoned over time.
* **Don’t worry about scaling**. Let’s say you have a new product with only 100 active users. If your marketing campaign gets you +500 actives, you’re ecstatic. Gain a few hundred users inside an established company, and you should clean up your resume. Thus, little channels can work: Running mini events with cool speakers, organizing a Facebook group, going after a single college/company/town, emailing your ex-colleagues/friends to try a new thing — these can all help in the early days. You won’t have the competition, the response rates will be higher since you’re doing it all by hand, and you can always scale over time by moving onto the next channel.
* **Novelty is in your favor**. There are only so many ways to sell a big established product to customers. The “wow” moments have all been used, the value prop is already understood. The response rate on marketing declines as a result. But if you’re a new, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed product on the market, and you have a “wow” product that presents well in a hype video, then you can get a nice big spike when you launch. And maybe even a few more smaller ones over time.
* **One-time is fine, repeatability is what you do later**. A lot of marketing tactics that work in the early days only work once — like a social media launch — but that’s OK. If you can prove that a few unscalable tactics work, and it helps you gain momentum via funding/hiring/otherwise, then over time you’ll have more time to try additional strategies.
* **Your product is brand new, so your marketing can be brand new as well**. When you build a new product, it’s always smart to take advantage of the new tech wave, so that you can create something different than what’s existed before. You want to be building a mobile app in 2010, not a website, and you want to be building in AI now. But in the same way, you can use these new technologies on the marketing side too. What does AI allow you to do in marketing that previously couldn’t happen? Whether it’s rapidly creating personalized creative, or generating concepts faster, or creating an interactive bot — what can you do different than no one is doing, using the new tech?
* **Take risks with your brand**. You can attract people with your brand by being polarizing. Say “this product is not for you, it’s for these other cooler people.” Or hit competitors directly in the face, in your marketing. Be aggressive. These are things that long-term employees of the world’s trustworthy brands can’t do, because they are being protective, and managing the downside. You need to do everything you can to stand out, because being ignored is the worst outcome for any marketing tactic.",2,1746134817.0,startups,1,1.0,False

As the title says. I cannot afford nor do I want to give money to Adobe. However, it seems that there is no competitor to Acrobat. I've seen a lot of custom sheets made using Acrobat so I'd like to seek the help of someone with access to simply create fillable forms, with a custom font, and embed that font such that anyone can use the PDF with that font even when viewing on a browser like Firefox (which always seems to revert the font back to Arial which messes up the font size and alignment. Additionally, i'd like the checkboxes to done in a way that they appear as a solid circle for the skills, and a cross mark for death saves, armor proficienies and shield.

It would not need to be done from scratch, just tidied up using Acrobat. I have templates made already with the fillable text fields and check boxes on there, but the formatting is off.

The sheet is a custom version of the 5.5e sheets, re arranged in an order that works better for me. Unsure if i'm allowed to post such a thing here.

He's probably one year older than me (i'm in second grade, he's in third), we have PE classes together and we sometimes have classes next to each other. Thinking of him has been keeping me up at night for months. I literally can't stop thinking about him. I even did a first move.

Once during PE, when we weren't doing anything and his friends were not near I approached him. I told him that he's pretty and his haircut really fits his face. He smiled and thanked me and since then, I really wanted to talk to him again.

In my class there is a girl who's friends with him and from her i know that he's (probably) not dating anyone right now, not gay and rather kind.

Today when I was talking with my older sister about him, she told me to ask him out on a walk or coffee and I would love to do that. The issue is that i'm quite awkward and don't know how to approach him. I don't know what to say and when to do that, since he's usually with his friends. 

Should i even try to ask him out? And what should i say? When i should do that?

I haven't found similar for this area yet. If you have any recommendations for local things to do, pls share. Tips on how to make friends would also be appreciated if you have any kind words to offer. Thank you. 

Things I enjoy: yoga, reading, coffee, camping, cycling, ultimate frisbee and disc golf, dogs (mine will stay with my ex until I find a dog friendly living situation), plants, tattoos, food, cars, movies and shows, and anything outside, really.

I also enjoy doing my makeup and tweaking my skincare routine, and self care (does this count as a hobby lol?) I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game sometimes on my switch. I also love dogs, if you have one send pics PLZ. 🥰 I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! ✨ Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too 😌

Im not really dead set on someone particular or a “type” I’m looking for, I’m very chatty and am hoping you are too though!

1kcjyj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Helpful_ruben/comments/1kcjyj2/raising_funds_beyond_bootstrapping/,Raising Funds Beyond Bootstrapping,"We successfully raised $500k in pre-seed funding from a mix of angel investors, family offices, and a strategic venture capital firm. Here's a snapshot of our journey:

Initial Bootstrapping Phase: We spent the first year building a working prototype, validating our market, and shaping our business model. We clocked $100k in revenue, primarily from our initial 10 clients. This bootstrap phase allowed us to refine our product-market fit, gain credibility, and establish a small but loyal customer base.

Strategic Partnerships: We identified complementary businesses that could benefit from our solution and forged partnerships to accelerate growth. This approach not only generated revenue but also expanded our network, showcasing our capabilities to potential investors.

Networking and Outreach: We attended industry conferences, seminars, and networking events to connect with potential investors, partners, and customers. We also leveraged our existing network, reaching out to friends, family, and professional connections. This helped us build relationships and generate interest in our company.

Pitch Decks and Proposals: We prepared a polished pitch deck and proposal highlighting our traction, market potential, and competitive edge. We tailored our message to resonate with each target investor, emphasizing the alignment between their goals and ours.

Coffee Meetings and Due Diligence: We scheduled coffee meetings with interested investors to discuss our vision, financials, and growth projections. This allowed us to build rapport, address concerns, and demonstrate our expertise. We also prepared comprehensive due diligence materials, providing transparency into our financials, operations, and intellectual property.

Term Sheets and Negotiations: We received multiple term sheets from investors and carefully evaluated each offer. We negotiated the terms, focusing on equity dilution, board representation, and strategic guidance. Ultimately, we secured a $500k pre-seed round with a 10% equity dilution.

Lessons Learned:

1. Be prepared to adapt: Our initial funding strategy centered around bootstrapping, but we quickly realized the need for external support. Be open to pivoting and exploring alternative options.
2. Focus on strategic partnerships: Partnerships can generate revenue, expand your network, and enhance your credibility. Identify complementary businesses and cultivate strong relationships.
3. Build relationships: Networking and outreach are crucial for fundraising. Attend events, engage with your network, and maintain a strong online presence.
4. Tailor your pitch: Prepare unique pitch decks and proposals for each target investor. Emphasize the alignment between their goals and yours.
5. Stay transparent: Be prepared to share detailed financials, operations, and intellectual property with investors. Transparency builds trust and credibility.

We hope this experience can serve as a valuable lesson for fellow entrepreneurs and business enthusiasts looking to explore fundraising options beyond bootstrapping.",1,1746134355.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False

My first ever submission here.

**13:01 AM**

**I**

That annoying alarm beeped three times before I woke up at 5 AM - I keep waking up on time just to shut that piece of shit. I've turned my head to the left, and Abigail wasn't there. 

We fought last night; she probably got Trisha and went to her mom's. She gets real upset when things don't go her way. I'm up to my neck with her - I'd divorce her, if not for the kid. Whatever. 

I brushed my teeth, and my gums hurt. I keep promising myself I'll quit smoking, but that likely ain't gonna happen. I'll have to stop for a pack of Marlboro Reds. I should eat. 

I popped the fridge open. It was so full that the cheese and bologna just slid out of there right into my face. Odd. Usually, I do the groceries, not Abigail. I'm not that hungry, so I just put some cheese on the bologna and washed that down with coffee, topping that with my last cig. 

I put on my steel-toes and hit the road. It was empty, as usual at this time. It's eerie, I like it when the only thing accompanying me is the hum of the truck's engine. Beats getting chewed out by my bitch wife all the time for sure. 

I rolled into the site. None of my men were there. Not even Fat Cheeks, who's usually early. He usually gets bullied the most by us, too. I don't know why this fact is relevant. Well, that's not the first time I arrived at an empty site either. They probably got drunk or did drugs last night, as most of them like to do. It's usually both. 

I decided to call Dick first. His real name is Arthur, but we call him Dick because his head is shaped like one. Dude is fucking ugly. Anyway, he's the least brain-dead of them all, so I need him to work on steel beams for today. And without the beams, we're not moving forward with construction today. 

I dialed. It rang for some, then went to voicemail. Stupid fucking idiot, he probably got wasted with all of them. Well, I need him today, so I drove to his house.

I banged on the door. ""Wake up dumbass!"" 

Again. ""You stupid piece of shit, the project's gonna halt because of you!""

I decided to twist the handle. It opened. Who the hell keeps their house unlocked while they sleep? Anyway, this place looks like a crack den - I'm pretty sure I caught syphilis just by inhaling air. I wandered around the place, and it felt deserted. The last proof of life was the bedroom, where I found his phone with my missed calls, scattered ibuprofen pills, and a messy bed. 

An eerie feeling hit my gut. Something was not right. I tried dialing the other dimwits and the story was the same. I need to smoke. 

I forgot to buy cigarettes. Luckily, there was a liquor store right outside. I wonder if Dick picked his place because he's a degenerate or a raging alcoholic, looking to be as close to his favorite place in the world as possible. Who the fuck am I kidding, he's both. 

I went in. Guns 'n Roses were playing on the radio. I like them. The counter was empty, no signs of the cashier taking a break either. 

""Hello?!"" I could even hear my voice echo. The cashier's probably taking a shit or something, so I just slid 20 bucks on the counter, popped the tobacco cover open and grabbed my Reds. I sat down on the curb by the liquor store and smoked, as I had no other option other than to wait until 8 AM and call corporate to explain what happened. 

I was smoking my second one until I oddly noticed something. No cars, no people, no one passed the street. Yeah, it's still early, but it's 7 AM. Not too early for some signs of life. Whatever, maybe I'm just imagining shit. 

I was bored out of my mind, but I managed to wait until 8. I called corporate. 

Ringing...

Ringing...

Ringing...

""Thank you for calling HSM Constructions. All of our lines are currently busy. Please try calling again later.""

The fuck? I know these disgusting corporate stuck-ups drink more alcohol and do more drugs than my guys. But they're usually coked up enough to show up to work on time. And it's 8 already, where are all the fucking people? Is no one going to work all of a sudden? 

Well, fuck this shit. I'm not waiting for anyone either. I guess it's a vacation day. 

I slammed the door on my truck and made my way home. Not a single car on the road, everybody's parked up neatly. No one walking their dog, no homeless junkie scoring the containers. I like the quiet, but this sort of emptiness felt like being stabbed in the gut, and the knife still being twisted all sorts of ways. Maybe it's just me seeing things, I've been hitting the bottle hard too, the past few weeks. 

**II**

I arrived home, but I didn't want to exit my truck. Something don't feel right. I better check up on Trish. Abigail's disgusting mother lives 20 miles south. I hate her so much, I could smash her skull in, take her tiny brain, and feed it to the coyotes. That bitch once punched Trish for leaving the plate in the sink. What, did she fucking expect a 4 year old to wash her dishes? And Abigail is turning into a bitter old bitch like her old lady. 

Fuck, I should calm down, I feel as if my heart is about to jump out through my mouth. 

Anyways, the drive was excruciating. Not a single sign of life out there. However, 10 miles in, I saw two cars fully entangled with each other. I was so glad. 

Not because of the car accident, fuck no. It was a sign that there was at least someone besides me out there. I approached the cars and saw something that made me instantly throw up. In one car, there was a woman whose head was split halfway by the pillar. 

With tears in my eyes, I examined the other car. Nothing but a blood trail, which completely disappears just near the roadside. As if that driver got injured, started bleeding, went towards the side of the road, and just vanished. 

With my hands trembling and tears streaming down my wrinkly face, I went back to the woman's car. I sat down on the cold asphalt and dialed 911.

What I heard was the eeriest part of this, I really hope, fever dream. 

It picked up. But all I heard was short bursts of radio static and a loud hum. I got connected, but likely all I heard were the sounds of an empty 911 call center. 

I saw a light flash in the woman's pocket. Turns out, it was her phone. I shakily rummaged through her pockets and pulled it out. It was just a Duolingo notification. It was time for her French lesson. 

I was about to turn the phone off until I noticed the time. It read: ""13:01 AM"". I shook my head, looked again. 

13:01 AM. Not military time, no European stuff. 13:01 AM.

I have to find Trish.

**III**

I finally arrived. I saw Abigail's car parked in the driveway. They're there, thank God. 

When I made my way inside, the only thing I heard was the crackly radio, where the host lady was stuck on repeat:

""The number four is associated with death in Chinese culture.""

*Pause*. 

The number four is associated with death in Chinese culture.""

And so on.

Something fucked up is happening. I rummaged through the house like crazy, but only managed to find Abigail's phone. I unlocked it, and it immediately opened messaging.

She was in the middle of sending a message to me. It read ""4444"". I felt my blood pressure skyrocket. What the fuck is going on? Where is Trish? Where is she? Where did these foul women take my daughter?

I was about to leave when I saw my daughter's drawing on the fridge. It was her first drawing of me, Abigail, and herself. I was the stickman with a cigarette in his teeth. 

Except in this one, Trish and Abigail were crossed out with a red crayon. But I wasn't. I felt sick, so I threw up in the bathroom and passed out doing so. 

**IV**

I woke up, 5 AM sharp. Back in my house. My fridge was filled to the brim again, the bologna and the cheese were untouched. No sound. No Trish. No Abigail. No fucking life, anywhere. Just me and that same full fridge, mocking me.

I couldn't just stand here, I had to look for Trish. What kinda piece of shit father gets stuck on the details and forgets about his daughter? I hit the road. The adrenaline fueled my sleepless search for a week. But then I passed out and woke up at 5 AM, back in my house again. 

Then, I tried to figure out what's going on. I tried the TV, the internet, everything. But it was all just pure bullshit, either just news from what now seems like weeks ago, or anything with the number 4. 

I have seen no one in weeks. But I keep waking up at my place no matter what. Food gets restocked, truck refueled, the power's up and running, but everything else is fucking dead. Maybe I should get someone to come to me.

That's what I tried to do. I smashed my neighbor's window and tripped the alarm. I set my house on fire. I screamed. I cried. I detonated a crafted bomb. Nothing.

The only way I found out that time is still moving forward is when I woke up in my house after the fire. It was completely rebuilt, one-to-one, but I saw some fire marks on the driveway. But that doesn't fucking help with anything, does it?

**V**

I spent the next weeks drinking and popping ibuprofen. It was real fucking nice, thought that this was gonna be the way I end this stupid misery. 

But one day, I woke up on my construction site. Precisely - on the highest level of the scaffolding, top of the unfinished building. That low-quality wood sent some sharp, stinging splinters into my back. One even got on my ass cheek. 

I looked below. I was so high up. I could jump and die instantly. Yeah, I should do that. 

I pushed myself through the scaffolding and was finally on the very edge of the structure. I felt the breeze, saw the absolute emptiness below. It was time to jump. 

""But isn't this what you wanted?""

It's probably just the drinking, I'm hearing things. I better jump and end this.

""I gave you exactly what you wanted, and even left some creature comforts for you.""

Comforts? What fucking comforts? This is a nightmare, just with food and internet.

""You reamed your wife, yelled at your daughter, secretly wished to be left all alone.""

I know I did.

""I gave you everything you want.""

The only thing I want is to end this. Shut the fuck up. 

And that's it. I jumped, I was so determined to kill myself, I didn't even shake or doubt my choice. I saw the ground coming closer to me, closed my eyes, and embraced it. I was finally free.

**VI**

Except I didn't die. I could barely breathe, and I couldn't open my eyes. But I could hear every fucking thing. I could hear the sirens of the ambulance, the chatter of the medics. 

""Male, 45, found on East Ave, jumped off a building. Possible suicide.""

I panicked internally. Were people there all the time? I heard intensified beeping. I just slightly managed to open my eyes, and I saw Trish and her mother behind all the medics.

Then, I flatlined. ",6,1746134346.0,WritingPrompts,1,0.88,False

I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt no sadness about that—he wasn’t important to me emotionally. I didn’t care about who he was as a person; I just needed someone’s attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Edited: this male friend never expressed romantic interest in me. Neither did I to him. Neither of us flirted with eachother or expressed romantic interest at all.",1,1746134068.0,moraldilemmas,3,0.67,False

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how messy the early stages of a startup can get—especially on the tech side. I've seen a bunch of founders with solid ideas struggle to move past the MVP stage because they didn’t have the right technical support early on.

As someone who's been a technical co-founder a couple of times (currently in NY), I’ve felt the chaos firsthand—juggling infra, product roadmaps, hiring, and actually building the thing. Sometimes you just need someone to bounce decisions off or help break down what’s actually critical at that stage.

Figured I’d open up a thread for folks in the trenches:

* Are you navigating tech without a technical co-founder right now?
* What’s been the toughest part—team, build vs. buy, scaling, etc.?
* Anyone here in the idea-to-preseed phase and just trying to stay sane through it?

Would love to hear how others are thinking through this. If anything, it's always good to swap stories (and mistakes) over DMs or coffee if you're nearby.

1kcjpoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/500DaysofSummer/comments/1kcjpoz/my_unusual_take_on_the_ending/,My (unusual) take on the ending,"I have been reading theories on what the ending of this movie is supposed to mean, and people usually only come up with two possible scenarios, a) Tom got over Summer completely, wisened up, stopped having unrealistic and delusional thoughts about love and met Autumn, with whom he will have a larger chance of “forever” with, or b) Autumn is supposed to be another season for Tom, just like Summer was (alas their names), Tom hasn’t learned anything and he will continue to be stuck in the same cycle. However, after watching this movie, I have come up with an analysis that I think is unique and I don’t know why more people aren’t talking about it, lol.

Tom is an anxious attachment type. We can see it from the beginning of the movie, the way that he begins to admire Summer from afar and continues to cling onto her all throughout, the way that he only remembers the good things about their moments and tries to hopelessly hold onto them. He doesn’t listen to her, he doesn’t see the reality, he’s just so in love it hurts him, and actually, both of them. 

In the end of the movie, we see Summer giving Tom some sort of a closure when they meet up at his favourite spot by coincidence. Here we learn that Tom no longer believes in “childish” things such as real love, soulmates, etc, they’re fairytales for him now. Even though Summer tells him he was right about it all along, he still keeps the same stance. This means that Tom has significantly changed. After this scene ended, I immediately thought, wow; Tom just went from an anxious attachment type to an avoidant like Summer. And before you call it nonsense, let me continue.

Then, Tom meets Autumn. They’re both waiting to be interviewed for the same job position. They have a small talk, yet Tom seems neutral, in a way that he never was with Summer. This is understandable, as he’s just been seriously hurt, and he may not completely be over Summer. Then, Autumn says that he’s familiar to her, that she’s seen him somewhere, and they come to a conclusion that she noticed him in his favourite spot in the city. To me, this is a significant point in the movie. When Tom says that he hasn’t noticed her, Autumn says that he “hasn’t been looking enough.” What this means for me is that:

Autumn has noticed Tom, in fact, she has been watching him from afar, in the same way that Tom was watching Summer. Perhaps not in such an obsessive way, we don’t know that, but she even repeats more than once how familiar he seems. And Tom, who was throughout the movie known to “stalk” Summer, is now in the other position. He didn’t even notice the girl that he’s talking to before, despite the fact that it’s Autumn’s favourite spot as well, which means that Autumn probably comes there just as often. But she was invisible to Tom, perhaps because he was too caught up with Summer to care about others.

After this conversation, Tom tries to ask Autumn for a coffee, yet she declines, saying that she’s supposed to meet someone later. Tom doesn’t seem to be too phrased by this and it’s unlike anything we’ve seen from him before, as he was a person who got hurt quite quickly and couldn’t accept being rejected. But in this case, he walks off, not looking too sad. In my mind, it’s something that Summer would have done. Before Tom can even leave, Autumn calls after him and says “sure!”, which means that she’s willing to change her plans for him, and possibly cancel a date. And that’s a big thing to do for someone you’ve just met!

Personally, I believe that the ending is supposed to show us how roles have reversed now. After being hurt by Summer, Tom has turned from this anxious attachment type to an avoidant just like her (we know that Summer had several exes which could contribute to her being so detached and unable to believe in love until she met her husband, and now the same thing is happening with Tom). On the other hand, Autumn seems to be a loving person, she’s even wearing red which means love, and she’s noticed Tom before, which leads me to believe that she could have been quietly obsessing over him. = She is an anxious attachment type. And so the roles have switched! Tom will experience just what Summer had to go through with him. (I don’t believe in choosing sides btw). He will perhaps get more understanding of Summer’s past actions because he will now be in the same situation. And Autumn will be chasing him, yet I don’t think that Tom will ever be as open and vulnerable as he could be before. If there ever was a continuation, yes it could be 500 days of Autumn, but with a twist! It’s Tom that doesn’t want a “forever” with Autumn and ends things off. 

So, this is my rant. It’s merely a theory, but I think there’s a lot of things in the movie leading me to ultimately believe that. Tom seems so different in the ending, maybe it’s just me, but he does. I don’t think he will ever love Autumn the same way he loved Summer. Which is not necessarily bad. But I just don’t think that Tom’s fully healed and that he and Autumn will see things eye to eye. I think this shows us that the same person can go through all stages, from being an anxious to an avoidant, based on what happened in their life and based on a particular situation. After all, I’ve seen many people talking about how they have been in both positions, as Tom and as Summer. And yep, that’s all. Have a good one. ",4,1746133732.0,500DaysofSummer,0,1.0,False

He'd been off for a couple of weeks and then was on a different delivery route but he was the driver this morning and he's single. I asked him in for coffee and he stood there, mouth agape, unable to speak. I gave him about 5 seconds and then asked if he was alright and he said he was just taken aback (which I found endearing) but yes, he'd love a cup of coffee. I used the espresso machine and broke out my fancy coffee for two lovely cappuccinos and we sat on the back deck, chatting and bird watching. 

He's 63, divorced, two adult children and four grandchildren, all of whom live out of state. He's semi retired but delivers for the local grocery store to keep busy. We have plenty in common and enough differences to keep us curious. He's intelligent, funny, and from what I can tell, kind. He stayed for another cappuccino and was here for about 90 minutes, before asking me to dinner on Saturday.

Today (Thursday) is a day off in my country, so, considering im a corpo lawyer trying to rescue a retarded CEO from his own poor judgment constantly and battling against his stage-4-dementia-like memory today should be a great day to sit on my not so fat ass all day and do fuck all, eat chips, drink beer and play oblivion remaster like there is no tomorrow… EXCEPT…
My wife and I discovered she has some hormonal imbalance so we have been seeing doctors and getting her hormone compensators, so… her period has become something way wilder than any other period she’s had, and you guessed it, it landed right-on spot-on today, the moment we woke up she just started crying for very valid reasons, albeit, things that have happened a long time ago, or wont happen yet, if at all (fears basically). 
Right away I knew I had to distance myself for the mental health wellbeing of both, why you ask? First, because she would just spiral downward to worse and worse spots if I was there 100% available, second reason, im also super stressed and God knows I need a day off, however, today wouldn’t be it, but I can make this labor less stressful on myself and smart in a way she is taken care of, so here’s what I did:
Took the dog on a long walk, she wanted to do it, she was under no condition to do it, so in a actually loving way, I managed to have some time alone to be just with the dog and my thoughts, this however was not so relaxing considering the searing heat the sun is spitting this days, it was nice nonetheless.
Got some chores done that implied the need to leave the house; taking trash outside and picking up fancy clean clothes at the dry cleaner.
Got her a coffee (frozen of course)
When im in the house she just starts crying randomly and even her admits there is no reason at all for some of her crying, she may be an emotional wreck but she has always been very reasonable and I must accentuate this because it makes it all a lot easier. 
However today has not been a free day by any stretch of the imagination.
Just writing this makes me feel infinitely better, alas, one wish to have a day when you don’t have to solve anyone’s problems, but that day simply never comes, “can a son of christ have a peaceful day?” Seems like simply too much to ask.
If you have opinions, advice, or simply want to vent, let this be a space to become better men, with wisdom or simply knowing that others may feel the same.
Know that I have included the dating flare because being married doesn’t mean you stop dating that woman, quite the opposite, you commit to dating her till one of you bites the dust and eachothers wellbeing is priority no1.

First off, let’s talk **power**. This thing has 250 watts of raw, barely noticeable strength — perfect for turning your onions into confetti while leaving one massive chunk floating around like it owns the place. Want evenly chopped garlic? Adorable. You’ll get some paste, some flakes, and one entire clove laughing at your expectations.

The **bowl capacity** is a generous 3 cups, which translates in real-life usage to “Don’t fill it past 1.5 or it’ll scream at you with a burnt-motor smell.” But hey, it’s BPA-free! So at least when it *melts from overuse*, you’ll be breathing in *slightly safer fumes*.

And yes, it does “chop and grind” with a **reversible stainless-steel blade**. Just don’t ask it to grind beans — that’s *clearly too advanced* for this modern marvel. No coffee for you, peasant.

Let’s talk **design** — brushed chrome and nickel, so it *looks expensive* while feeling like a kid’s toy. Want to impress your friends who don't cook? Leave it on the counter. Want to make pesto for actual humans? Get a real food processor.

Cleanup is “easy” they say. Sure, if you enjoy chasing tiny flecks of food under the blade like it’s a horror movie mini-game. It is dishwasher safe though — assuming you don’t mind it slowly warping over time like your dreams.

Also included? A **mini spatula** that screams, “I was an afterthought!” and a recipe book from 2003 that suggests you use this processor for *hummus* (bold move, Cuisinart… very bold).

Some people might have been disappointed to see that the base strength of ""Apple Acid"" Yogurt-Dressed Salad is lower than ""Defiant"" Coffee-Dressed Salad, but in terms of efficiency Apple Acid is the new #1 efficient Salad. The difference is very small right now but if the Chansey line ends up being a power creep on egg farming then that efficiency gap will grow larger. (Petal Blizzard is pretty bad though)

We work in two different parts of building but see each other once in a while. We've actually spoken before but for some reason recently it's become really awkward between us. He's like the only other person (around my age) in the building besides my boss's friends that acknowledges my presence and I wish I could push aside my anxiety and just approach him. It's been like a year seen we officially met and it's so cold between us for no reason??

I'm not that good at small talk, and I don't want to come off as weird or anything. Like what do I do? Ask if he wants to go out for coffee? I don't want him to think I'm asking him out on a date. I mean he's cute but I legitimately just want a new friend.

Unfortunately our jobs are so different, so there isn't a lot of cross over, meaning I don't have any indirect ways of seeking him out without just seeing him once in a while, and every time we do see each other, it's really quick awkward glances and smiles and then poof gone. I really hope he doesn't think I'm weird or something. Should I just let it go?

Why is the Denver Auditor suddenly obsessed with str\* ppers? Yes, I said it. Str\* ppers. I keep seeing post after post, as though this is the most pressing issue facing our city. Are we serious? We have homelessness exploding, crime creeping into once-safe neighborhoods, and working families struggling just to keep the lights on. But for some reason, our city thinks that people like me who have worked multiple jobs for their entire life just to live in this city are now INFERIOR to adult entertainers.

I’m not here to disrespect anyone’s line of work. But let’s get real. Most hourly workers in this city would be BLESSED if they could take home $400 in tips a night. Meanwhile, the people who serve our coffee, stock our grocery shelves, and care for our elderly are being thrown to the wolves. and we SURE ARENT getting social media shout-outs from city officials.

I’m old enough to remember when city leadership meant rolling up your sleeves and tackling tough issues, not chasing headlines and social media likes. This is not what I pay my hard earned tax dollars for.

If the Denver Auditor and the Mayor think this is what progress looks like, they’ve lost touch with the people who built this city and keep it running. Enough is enough. 

I voted for Mike Johnston and even had a sign in my yard. But now I'm thinking that maybe I need to find a city that doesn't alienate and push out its hard working citizens. SMH!!",1,1746132931.0,u_DenverDiva9099,0,1.0,False

I haven’t even started out but it’s been in the back of my mind for YEARS! I’ve always loved older men and found them attractive aswell as always connected with adults when I was younger.

Early 20s, fairly successful so far as I have a decent job, have worked very hard for the things I have and currently in college. I love love + affection, I’ve been in a vanilla relationship but honestly get bored.  It’s the same boring routine with men my age, they don’t seem to like having real excitement or dates, I haven’t really been able to experience my kinks or try out new kinks in the bedroom to see what I’m into sex wise, most men my age aren’t mature or confident. 
Would becoming a SB be more fit for me in my life right now? What steps should I take in becoming a SB? Profile advice? 

My worry is that my confidence will play a huge part in my downfall. I’ve always been told I’m a pretty girl and attracted older men who came to get coffee at a past job as a barista. I’m a pretty petite girl which personally I don’t love about myself. I have a one year old so pretty insecure about my chest and belly from a csection, not that you can really see the scar but I know it’s there. Will a SD see my flaws like I see them? Will a SD point out things about my body that’s going to make me more insecure? Do some SD even like petite girls anymore or is that just a social stereotype?

I’m into this to meet confident, successful business savvy men who have life experience to lend me. Someone to connect with and give me attention and make me feel good to gain more self confidence. On the downside of that, I’m not in this because I “need” a SD or need help with income. Just for the excitement but the funds are a bonus and will excite me more! Any info or advice is welcome.

So a few months ago, I wallowed in misery over not having a dick. In a desperate attempt to relive some dysphoria, I thought that I should try my hand at standing to pee (stp). After a few failed attempts, I deduced that I would need to make a diy stp device to succeed. 

Forlorn with my failures, I turned to the ftm wiki to search for a solution. I found a simple guide to make a homemade stp from a plastic coffee tin lid. Step 1, find lid, step 2, cut the rim off, step 3, profit! 

And so my dumb boy brain wandered around to find a coffee tin lid, except that my dad grinds his own coffee and doesn’t buy coffee tins. The closest thing I could find was the lid of an empty yogurt container; it was a little small, but a lid is a lid, right? 

One I had cut the rim off, I proudly marched to the bathroom, ready to finally enjoy my long-earned piss. Keep in mind that I’d been holding it for a good 30 minutes while I created my stp device. 

Turns out, convincing your brain to pee while standing up is actually pretty hard after a life of sitting to do it. But anyways, I finally forced my brain to let me pee and it actually went pretty smoothly. 

Now here’s where I screwed up: in an attempt to make sure there was no leakage down there, I assumed a pretty bizarre grip on the yogurt lid. Deed done, I triumphantly pulled the stp away in preparation to clean up. I attempted to grab a piece of tp with one hand while keeping hold of my stp. Moments later, I felt the lid bend and ricochet out of my hand as I had unconsciously tighten my grip.

It soared in a graceful arc before landing straight in the bowl of the toilet. Queue freak out. It went from “WTF happened” to “haha it fell in what are the odds” to “oh shit it fell in what am I going to do?” in a span of seconds. 

In what I can only describe as an act of sheer desperation, (spoiler for gross) >! I stuck my hand in the toilet water and pulled it out. !< Oh gods, even just typing that makes me feel nasty. So after that, I washed the stp (and my hands) twice with soap.

I still have that stp somewhere for emergencies but obviously I retired it as soon as I could find another lid to make a stp. And yes, I know that in theory toilet water is clean, but the whole thing left me feeling icky.

And so ends the mortifying tale of how I simultaneously had the best and worst piss of my life by peeing stand up for the first time ever and dropping my stp in the toilet.",14,1746132666.0,ewphoria,3,1.0,False

If I seem familiar, I probably am. Feel free to send a request if you think so.

Main concern, I’m a borderline agoraphobic in a failing relationship. I tried playing myself up and stretching the truth, but this is really who I am :/

I don’t go outside because I’m scared of strangers, I feel like everyone looks at me weird. I was an asshole kid raised by a mom I couldn’t quite figure out so I’m conflicted internally with everything.
I’d rather stay inside and away from people who know me to avoid coming into contact with them, because they would immediately know they’re doing better than me.

I drink tons of Coffee, listen to YouTube to drown out my Thoughts, and Draw. I’m trying to stop smoking pot.
You can find me in a foggy state, telling you something and everything that’s related to it, all at once.
I’m always confused.
My grammar and punctuation has regressed.
If you ask me to recall something, you’re going to get a lot of “from what I can remember” or really weird sounding things I say (it’s just me trying to remember something)
I probably have dementia idk my memory was bad but it’s getting worse.


Why don’t I have a Job? I don’t have any inviting skills, worse experience. I couldn’t work a milk frothier without it overheating and almost spilling out.

I dream about being on my own, though.
doing something easy, but I know I can’t live on my own.
so I just rather have a pen pal or I dunno, someone on the same timeline as me.

I feel alone, and I don’t like showing it in the way I do.

Looking for other Losers I guess.
Or people who have something to say to make themselves feel better and Kind.

If we vibe, I’m open to something longer.

About Me (The Fine Print):

* I’m married and ethically non-monogamous (ENM). My open marriage is solid, but I don’t date often because I’m busy chasing big goals and growing my businesses.
* Brooklyn born and raised, with Bangladeshi roots.
* I’m an “Atheist Muslim”—not religious at all, but culturally tied to my heritage. (Yes, there’s a loophole that says even the worst Muslims might sneak into heaven, so why risk it?)
* Proud dad to two amazing daughters. I had a rough childhood, so I’m all about giving my kids a life full of love and support.

Why You’ll Want to Grab Coffee with Me:  
I’m funny, confident, and genuinely happy. I’m a mix of driven CEO and thoughtful homemaker-think bold ambition with a side of killer massages. I’m great at planning memorable dates, listening, and making you feel valued. Bonus: I’m a trivia nerd with a knack for random facts. If you’re looking for a kind, passionate guy who’ll treat you right, let’s chat.

What I’m Looking For:  
I’m drawn to a woman with her own busy, ambitious life-someone cool with hanging out once or twice a week.

1.      Suppose I start here: I think I loved a secret more than I loved the boy who kept it. Or maybe the secret *was* the boy. Is that too simple? Suppose I admit this necklace – green, dense, faintly humming – became the locus of that confusion. Worn right here, between the collarbones. A bruise made permanent.

2.      Saw a science program once. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds formed in stellar collisions. Imagine. Beauty born from celestial violence.

3.      I trace the edge with my nail. Again. A nervous habit, maybe Its resilience reminds me of certain silences.  The mineral stubbornness pressing lines into my skin.

4.      His earnestness, a fragile shield against… what? Did we even know then? Just boys and girls playing dress-up with emotions too big for us. The necklace felt like part of that costume. Necessary ballast.

5.      I remember pressing it hard against my skin sometimes. Feeling the coolness, then the warmth leaching from my own body into the stone. What was I trying to do? Absorb it? Understand it by touch? A small, stupid ritual against the larger unknowns.

6.      Reading mother’s diary felt like this, too. Pressing my face against the page, trying to inhale her handwriting. Was I trying to *be* her? Or just prove I existed outside the shadow of the crash? The necklace, fragment of that same fire, felt like evidence. Exhibit A: Girl Tethered to Tragedy. Its green glow, a sickly nightlight against the darkness of her absence.

7.      He smelled of sun and hay and something else. Something electric, unsettling. Like the air before a storm. *This time, Lana.* His eyes would plead. My pulse, a trapped bird against the stone.

8.      Suppose I admit it: my primary orientation is towards a piece of rock. I love blue, but the world seems to be saturated with green. A point of cold pressure just below my throat. Sometimes I forget it's there, until I shift wrong, or the chain catches, it suddenly catches against the ordinary fabric of the day. An inescapable weight.

9.       I read that Meteorites carry traces of amino acids. Building blocks of life. Here, they brought death. And this fragment I wore? It seemed to carry only the echo of his pain. A building block of distance. Is that life?

10.  Performance becomes second nature in a town like Smallville. The Smile. The Tilt of the Head. The Appropriate Level of Grief. The Necklace was part of that uniform. I remember catching its reflection in the window of the Talon, superimposed over my own face. Which was the mask?

11.   She catches me touching the stone again. A flicker in her stare—not judgment, just… always noticing. My thumb hides the green. But she’s already turning away. What did she see? A souvenir, or the scar; maybe just the chaotic green I wear.

12.   Are the hinges of my apartment made of glass?  The coffee shop was supposed to be a serene space. It’s more like diorama of my entrapment: I’m like both prisoner and exhibit, serving lattes in a cage dressed as a Nilotic sanctuary.

13.  Is it a sin to crave the texture of truth? Even if it's cold, sharp-edged? This stone doesn’t lie. Its green simply *is*. Unlike the shifting landscapes in people’s eyes, the careful architecture of their smiles. This weight, at least, feels constant. But maybe that’s the biggest lie of all – mistaking mineral silence for honesty. My own pathetic fallacy.

14.  Is it possible to get used to poison? A low dose, every day, until your body doesn't register the sickness, just the constant unease. Until the green glow feels like normal light.

15.  What do you do when the person you love causes you physical pain, just by being near what defines *you*?

16.  Paris had soft light. Grey stone that absorbed sound. Stood before Monet’s Nymphéas for an hour. All that blue felt like a different planet. Could barely remember the colour green. A lie, of course. You never forget the feel of the cage.

17.  Took it off. Placed it in a cedar box Nell had made years ago. The sudden lightness felt wrong. Like an amputation.

18.  People talk about scars fading. Does embedded radiation fade? Or does it just become part of your cellular makeup, indistinguishable from the self? You carry the source within. Removal doesn't guarantee decontamination.

19.  From the sky-fire that took them. My parents. And I wear it. Daily. Is this piety, or a kind of morbid map-making? An attempt to trace the coordinates of absence, right here, against my own skin.

20.  The Talon. My messy, imperfect try at something real. Coffee grounds on the floor, the clatter of mugs. Then Clark would walk in, and the air would thicken. The green stone, even tucked under my shirt, felt suddenly loud. A tuning fork for his evasions. He'd promise. *This time, Lana.* And the stone felt like a lie detector against my own pulse. Steady, knowing beat: *No.*

21.  Is memory just choosing which bruises to press on? Over and over...or am I? This one is—cool and green; perpetually tender.

22.  He once gave me a rare orchid. Perfect, waxy petals. Unreal. He said its particular shade reminded him of my eyes. I think it reminded him of the necklace. Something beautiful, cultivated, and containable. Something he could eventually own.

23.  I confess I have built a life around a piece of green stone. A shard collected from the wreckage. It rests against my sternum now, always cool. They say remember the those we lost.  Suppose I admitted that some days, the coldness of it feels less like memory, more like the core of the loneliness itself.

24.  The feeling of the chain, thin against the skin on my neck. Sometimes catching a strand of hair. A tiny, persistent irritation. A reminder.  


25.  Sometimes, it’s just green. Dull jade in the shade. Other times, caught in a certain light, it seems to pulse. A faint, unhealthy viridescence leaking out. Like poison trying to pass as jewel. Like a secret held so tight it glows.

26.  A man out by Hob's Pond swore he saw lights fall the night of the shower. Said they hummed a tune. People called him crazy. Maybe. Or maybe just observant.  
  


27.  Do memories attach themselves to objects? Or do objects become anchors for the storm inside? Pressing the cool green stone against my temple. Trying to still the thoughts. A futile exercise. Like trying to map fog.

28.  Authenticity? Tried to find it in textbooks, in relationships, in independence. Is it something you find? Or something you are granted?

29.  That hard, phosphorescent green. The color of this rock, yes. But also oscilloscope screens. Digital rain in *The Matrix*. An unnatural energy. A signal from somewhere else, disrupting everything.

30.  And Lex. He arrived with answers. Not truths, perhaps, but answers. Plausible surfaces. Explanations like smooth, cool stones skipping over the murky depths Clark navigated. Lex didn’t carry a secret like a burden; he wielded secrets like tools. Or weapons.

31.  Hold it up to the window on a rainy day. Does stone absorb sorrow? It just refracts the gray light, dense and mute. I read somewhere about rocks holding magnetic memory. Perhaps this piece remembers the fire, the speed, the impact. Maybe I touch it hoping for transmission. A jolt of clarity. Am I simply assigning narrative weight to a random piece of cosmic debris?

32.  Does the green fade? Or just seep deeper into the bloodstream? Still waiting for an answer.

33.  That necklace, that small green thing, made his proximity agony. Think about that. Love as proximity-induced pain. The green glow, the color of an impossible equation.

34.  A snag. The chain catches on the wool of my sweater. Just a tiny, routine friction. And suddenly: the linoleum floor of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic, the sticky green soap in the dispenser. *That* green. This stone didn't create the feeling, it just gave it a locus. Something tangible to wear around my neck, a portable memento of the moment the world cracked.

35.  To find oneself irrevocably altered. Choiceless. Defined by an event, carrying its physical remnant. Its muteness. That is the point, perhaps. A constant, quiet assertion of the rupture. Maybe this uncomfortable persistence is the closest thing to truth I possess.

36.  My fingers find it without thinking. Stress, uncertainty, a sudden chill—the familiar smooth shape; the outline of its mineral stubbornness.

37.  How to describe Lex’s control? Not chains. More like… altering the magnetic poles. So all your compasses point toward him. Even your own body, a traitor collaborating with the narrative he spun. Phantom life. Sickeningly precise.

38.  His pain. A physical thing. A barrier woven into the fabric of the town, the air, the necklace. My closeness was agony for him. Love measured in excruciating proximity. Green was the color of that impossible space between us.

39.  What is this compulsion to touch it? Trace its edges until my fingerprint smudges its surface? Not like wanting Clark, the heat of that. No. This is different. A desperate, almost geological curiosity. What would happen if I put it in my mouth? Let the cold strangeness dissolve on my tongue? The *wanting* is there- Is it a strange thought? To integrate it somehow. To understand its alien indifference from the inside out.

40.  To want truth so badly you’d tear the world apart for it. Then realize you might be tearing yourself apart instead.

41.  Trust erodes like sandstone. Faster here. Each lie, each evasion, not a hammer blow, but water dripping. Persistent. Inescapable. You wake up one day and the foundation is just… gone. Replaced by suspicion. That hard, watchful green.

42.  Is it perverse to miss the weight of it now? The certainty of that specific pain? At least it was a map. A known territory of hurt.

43.  He made the lies physical, undeniable. Cellular. Suddenly the necklace seemed like a childish token. A surface secret. Lex dealt in biological truths, rewritten realities. His deception wasn't a weight; it was an infection. The green I wore felt clean compared to that invisible violation.

44.  I took it off. Put it in a box. Felt like burying a part of myself. The part that waited. The part that believed, maybe, that truth was graspable, solid like stone. It’s more like a tear now than jade stone.

45.  Loneliness can make you mistake control for comfort. I know that now.

46.  Heavier than stone, the weight of what it represented. The unsaid. The perpetually deferred truth. You get used to carrying it, adjust your posture. Until one day you try to stand straight without it and find you’ve forgotten how.

47.  Am I just cataloging grievances? Polishing the stone of my own hurt? Perhaps. But understanding the shape of the cage is the first step, isn't it? Even if you can't find the key.

48.  Sometimes, I dream in green. Not the soft green of new leaves. The hard, phosphorescent green of trapped energy. Of things that fell from a great height and shattered everything. It doesn't fade. That color. It just finds new surfaces to stain.

* Good frothing wand
* Bypass doser (or dual bean hopper, but I think that would be overkill)
* Small-ish footprint. The Saeco was 11-12"" wide, and I'd prefer not to go much wider.
* Good reliability - I'd probably prefer more manual controls over touchscreens, but I don't feel strongly about it.

*Wake up.*

*Suppress crippling loneliness.*

*Shower.*

Afterwards, I sat by my bedside table, staring at the framed portrait of my daughter.

*Feeling the hole at the very centre of my being dilate.*

Chucking some work folders in my bag, I swirled the bitter dregs of my filter coffee and grabbed my keys.

Outside, it was another drizzly, autumnal morning.

As had become the norm, I took a precautionary glance around the back of my car before placing my bag on the backseat.

No sign of *Jane*. *Yet.*

Typically, she appeared once I was driving, the vibrations jostling her from whatever hidey nook she’d found the night before.

*“Morning Jane,”* I smiled, as I sat down. By this point, I was definitely over just how ridiculous it might seem to any passersby - me, greeting the invisible nothingness inside my car…

*Let alone a spider.*

But Jane was my little bright spark. A pale, tan-spotted ray of hope in an otherwise empty, lonely life.

I’d spotted her for the first time a few months back. After checking my blindspot as I changed lanes, I’d turned back to find her slowly descending a silken thread in front of my left eye. Assuming she was in my hair, I’d tried to gently bat her away, but she was closer than my depth perception could interpret and I never quite hit her.

Eventually, she retraced her web away from me, back to the headliner.

But over time I grew curious.

She too, I think.

She became a regular fixture of my day-to-day.

What she was doing, eating…

I began trapping flies inside the car, to make sure she had enough food.

Before long, I found myself whiling away hours at a time, just waiting for her to appear…

Stranger still, I began actively *looking forward* to traffic - as it represented an unrestricted chance to just watch her *be*.

One time, while sitting in a mile-long queue of belching cars, Jane began knitting a web in the corner of the windscreen - which began to slowly fog up. As the world beyond faded from view, it felt like the simplest, purest thing - to watch her building her little web.

After that day, I decided to name her.

*Jane*, after my daughter. Who was always busy, beautiful.

But today…

Today I noticed a little, lifeless husk curled up on my dash; its legs hunched, turned in like a tiny death cage.

It was Jane.

*I shouldn’t have named her. Naming implies attachment. Affection.*

*Love.*

*“Remember what we agreed…”* the insidious voice whispered in my ear. *“In exchange for your dying daughter’s miraculous recovery, you* promised *to never feel love again…”*

The wicked voice smiled.

*“No exceptions, we said. Otherwise*…I *take* them.”

The silence swarmed horribly.

*“Better steer clear of Jenny at work, too,”* the demon leered. *”I think she likes you.”*",12,1746132172.0,shortscarystories,2,0.88,False

1kciz39,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kciz39/should_not_have_started_on_this_journey_and_now_i/,Should not have started on this journey and now I cant control the kick from it,"I am from India and married (arranged) 10 yrs ago. I always had a high sex drive. My wife knows about this. Unfortunately, she always uses bedroom intimacy as a bargaining chip to make me agree to her demands. If I disagree with her on any matter ( big or small ), she would not speak to me for days nor allow me get close to her. For years, I suffered this treatment. 

My wife is not as sexually active as me and I can understand that. She commented sometimes that my high sex drive makes her like a sex doll and I should leave her alone sometimes. I respected that and masturbation was my go to during these times. We had sex once or twice a week and rest of time I had to DIY.  This went on for a few years. But I never thought of another woman to satisfy my desires. 

About an year ago, my wife said her colleague (woman) at work has a platonic male partner who is like a husband minus the sex. They go out for dates and do a lot of things romantically but physical intimacy (kissing and sex) is not allowed. Apparently her husband knows about this and is okay with it. My wife asked me if I am okay with this concept. I felt a slap across my face. I said I cannot think of how this okay or acceptable. I felt cheated and I explained my emotions and feelings to her clearly.  She did not expect that level of reaction from me. She said ""it was not her intention to go down that route. It was just a question.. blah blah blah""  but I knew she was lying. It was clear that she wanted intimacy from another man. It was just packaged as a non-romantic platonic friendship.  I was confused because as a couple we spend a lot of time together regularly- coffee dates, holidays, movies, dinner dates, adventure sports, events and so on. Then where is the need for another person? If she has decided to discuss it with me, I felt she already crossed the mental barrier of monogamy. In an unbelievable manner, she turned the blame on to me. As I was not meeting her needs, it is only fair for her to look for intimacy outside. I said ""What? what about all the talk about sex doll etc"" and her response was "" that was then, this is now "" .. whatever!

  
That day I changed. I never felt the same level of trust or respect for her. All these years, I suppressed my sexual needs to respect her feelings. And she thought it would be okay to involve another man.  I felt I was unfair to myself. There was no need for me to suppress my needs to her anymore. And so it started .. In this internet age, it was easy for me to find sex outside. The first time I was very nervous. I knew I was cheating on my wife and I did not want to do it but I wanted to do it because I felt I was already cheated. I wanted to prove to myself that it was not me who was not meeting her needs... it was the her! The girl I saw gave me an unforgettable experience. Thats it.. I had tasted pleasure in another form and I was hooked. The 2nd time was easier and by the next few visits, the betrayal feeling disappeared from me. 

In the last 10 months, I must have gone out more than 50 occasions. I know it is wrong but I enjoy the kick.  I am addicted to the excitement before and the post nut clarity + repentance later. Rinse and repeat! My wife has not spoken about that platonic friendship again. Our relationship has not been the same. She knows the damage that her discussion has done. We cannot separate as our kids need us and our culture does not allow us to divorce that easily. Good thing is that I don't argue much anymore because I know she cannot punish me in the bedroom anymore.

I just wanted to blurt it out as it has been on my mind for a while. Irrespective of my wife's position, I know I am in the wrong.

1kcixw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1kcixw1/postpartum_thyroiditis_and_mental_health_issues/,Postpartum thyroiditis and mental health issues?,"My second baby is almost 6 months old. About 2 months ago I started seeing a psychiatrist because I was having depression/anxiety symptoms. I thought it was fear that my poor ability to focus would make me bad at my upcoming new job. I felt overwhelmed by the responsibilities that come with 2 kids, so I was scared of adding my first formal job since before my first was born.

About 1.5 months ago I started the new job and my resting heart rate started increasing. About 1 month ago, I experienced a traumatic event, followed by 3 weeks of illness for my toddler, husband, and me. My resting heart rate rate is 105 bpm most of the time, including at night. I've been taking Unisom to sleep.

My psychiatrist prescribed Adderall before blood test results showed hyperthyroidism. Now I'm on 5 mg metoprolol from my PCP but it hasn't decreased my heart rate, it might just be making me fatigued.

We're waiting on another blood test that checks antibodies, but I assume it's most likely postpartum thyroiditis since I haven't had thyroid issues before.

I feel amazing when I drink coffee but obviously that makes sleep worse.

If you had postpartum thyroiditis, what medications made you feel better? Did yours come with mood/focus issues? Did the mood/focus issues go away with thyroid treatment or did you need psychiatric medication? If so which ones worked for you?

I've always had ADHD symptoms and felt really relieved to finally have help... but now I can't take the adderall because of the hyperthyroidism...

I'm still talking to my doctors of course but hoping to hear similar experiences. Thanks in advance.",1,1746131767.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

I use several different strategies and plans that may change depending on what the previous day did. Options/scalping and market liquidity methods are just part of a larger reasoning and calculation. I will share these methods with you for free if you want to learn. Because trading without an actual reason as to why the price is moving the way it is and relying on blind spots and line indicators is a recipe for disaster. That‘s why people lose money, because you are open to overtrading, your strategy or plan does not have the criteria to win money, and because you are afraid of overtrading, it will inevitably happen again.

1kciwxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kciwxt,"[Review] QiZheLe/Nifeliz ""Tactical Armor"" Mecha from AliExpress","I haven't seen a review of these on this subreddit yet so I thought I'd make one. There's a couple different stores on AliExpress selling these, but I purchased from ""Coffee Car Toys Factory Store"" since they had really good coins discounts (40% - 50%). Though there isn't any official manufacturer listed, the boxes indicate that these were made by QiZhiLe, who I haven't heard of before. Nifeliz seems to have distributed the exact same kits with fancier packaging/instructions on Amazon in the USA (for which there are a number of youtube reviews you can find by searching for ""Nifeliz Tactical Armor"").  
  
**Price: (10/10)**  
Though the normal price was typically around $12, I paid $5.56 for the red one and $6.62 for the blue one, including tax and shipping by using coins and coupons. Due to politics, the shipped price to USA is now listed around $17, but goes down to around $13 after coins discounts and coupons. It seems like the Nifeliz prices were in the $25 range when they were in stock on Amazon. I'm considering gettting a third kit from the four options, even though the price is now higher, since I had relatively good experiences with these two.

**Part Quality: (8/10)**  
Overall the parts were adequate. Clutch was consistent and a bit tighter than genuine LEGO, which is good since there are some occasional weak build techniques used. Several (\~5-10 per set) of the small ball-socket joints had very noticeable mold flash around the socket area that I had to clean out with a knife, but the resulting clutch was very tight, which is important for poseability. For the blue meteor kit, I had some trouble inserting the 3L rods into some of the pieces and actually broke them, so I replaced them with some genuine LEGO rods that I had spare from a pick-a-brick wall trip.

**Packaging: (10/10)**  
Excellent. This AliExpress seller provided the boxes shown in the listing pictures shipped inside an outer cardboard box, so there inner boxes were almost pristine.

**Design/Build/Playability: (10/10)**  
These are really well made and fun to play with. Relatively good poseability and a lot of neat little details, especially in the verniers/thrusters and weapons. I did made some slight alterations to the design, particularly in reducing the length of the rears so they didn't protrude too much, but it only required a single 1x4 plate in white for each kit. I also swapped some armaments/weapons around on different sides of the red mecha and changed the way the guns were shaped on the blue mecha. The hip joints can be a little overtaxed by the weight. The feet are well-proportioned (i.e. not oversized) which looks good but also means they're small and so making a dynamic pose on the ground that is stable can be troublesome. I do want to build an action base of some kind, but it will need to be a bit beefy since these are quite a bit heavier than Gundams. Both mecha have a technic pin hole under the waist for mounting.

**Issues:**  
I was missing one piece from the blue meteor kit (Bracket 1 x 1 - 1 x 1, 36841) and had two spares of other pieces in the same bag, which was why the error wasn't caught by the machine. I tried contacting Nifeliz who said it wasn't their set so they could not replace it, and I tried contacting QiZhiLe but never received a reply. The seller on AliExpress also did not provide any help, just the offer for a return with full refund. I ended up taking a dremel to another piece from my Lepin spares and gluing it to the spare 1x1 from this set with JB Weld and it held good enough. It wasn't a structurally important piece, but still was annoying. The red mecha did not have any missing pieces.

Overall, great, would recommend if you can get it in the <$10 range with coin discounts. Still reasonably priced at $15-$20 if you like mecha.",5,1746131698.0,lepin,1,1.0,False

Time: 2:11 P.M.

Date: Feb. 35 2406

Location: Martian Frontier

The ride back from Epsilon Prosthetics was silent, and that silence sat in Adam's chest like a coiled wire, tension humming just beneath the skin. He couldn't pry his mind off of any of it. It just sat and festered deep in his consciousness. Every time the transport jolted over the uneven flooring, he clenched his jaw a little harder. His hands gripped the steering wheel tightly enough to cause his knuckles to turn white.

Ares had nodded off beside him. Her head bumped lightly against the window with each turn, but she didn’t stir. Adam didn’t blame her. She apparently had stayed up late the night before for the previous case. Her adrenaline must've run stale and crashed her system.

He kept his eyes on the metal passage, though the path was little more than muscle memory by now. Fluorescent signs glowing in bright neon reds, greens, blues, and hours of magenta blurred past as his thoughts clawed back toward Roseanne, toward that lifeless pod and the sterile chill of Epsilon. Her ring now felt like a lead weight in his pocket, pressing down with every breath he took.

The Martian highway, a reinforced tunnel etched beneath the red soil, stretched ahead. Lights overhead flickered intermittently, casting the interior in alternating bands of yellow and shadow. Memories flashed into his mind. His old days in highschool, meeting Roseanne for the first time. He began to tear up slightly.

The engine’s rumbling kept him focused on the road ahead. The silverish panels below it's wheels groaned under the transport’s weight. Ares stirred slightly in the passenger seat, murmuring something incoherent before settling again. Adam just let out a breath of air.

Adam didn’t pull into the precinct garage. Instead, he turned onto a back service road that looped behind the station. It was an old habit when he didn’t want to be seen walking in. Today, he didn’t feel like moving through the chaos again.

The service tunnel curved sharply to the left, leading to a maintenance bay rarely used since the station’s expansion. Adam brought the vehicle to a stop in the shadows between two stacks of abandoned storage crates, the engine coughing before falling into silence. For a long moment, he didn’t move. The faint hum of the recycled air vents overhead was the only sound that rang through the enclosed room. The walls echoed the sound near perfectly, something that Adam had complained about for a while yet has finally gotten used to.

He let her rest a few more minutes while he stared at the wall of the tunnel, unmoving. The red dust had caked in thick layers on the floor and walls, muting the otherwise sterile steel. His thumb absently rubbed Roseanne’s ring in his pocket, feeling the slight imperfections in its engraving. Her initials were etched inside, barely visible anymore. His face darkened slightly.

He finally reached over and gently nudged Ares.

She blinked, dazed, then stretched with a groan. “Are we... back?” she asked, voice still thick with sleep.

“Yeah,” Adam replied, already stepping out. “Back entrance. Didn’t want the vultures seeing us.”

Ares pulled herself out of the passenger seat, brushing Martian dust off her coat and yawning as she stretched. Her eyes flicked to Adam, noticing how tightly he held himself. She didn’t ask. Instead, she fell in step behind him as he keyed in the override for the maintenance door.

The door to the precinct's back corridor groaned louder than Adam remembered. He cursed under his breath and made a mental note to oil the damned hinges himself if maintenance kept ignoring the ticket. The hallway beyond was dim, sparsely lit by a flickering overhead fixture that buzzed like an insect caught behind a screen.

Adam led the way, his boots making a soft scuffing sound on the worn-down tiles. The precinct felt different from the back. It was quieter, colder. He preferred it this way. No bustling officers, no politics. Just cold halls and routine.

Ares followed, shaking off the last remnants of sleep, her footsteps a little heavier than usual. She glanced around as they moved through the maintenance wing, eyes catching on old bulletin boards filled with curling printouts and faded photos. The ghosts of old cases seemed to watch them.

“You remember all this propaganda?” she asked, voice low.

Adam’s eyes flicked to the board as they passed, the corners of his mouth tugging downward.

“Yeah. Back before the Martian colony.” Adam let out a scoff. “Epsilon promised new frontiers, discovery, cheaper housing, and free food.” He continued, “While food is free, housing is cheap, and Mars is currently leading in scientific progres, the food is shit, housing is shit, and the progress kills.”

“So shit too, huh?” Ares rolled her eyes. “Why'd you even come to Mars?”

“See, believe it or not, I was wide eyed and full of piss and vinegar just like you.” He let out a chuckle. “I just got out of highschool when they sent out applications. I thought it was a miracle at the time. Every twelve year old’s dream was to go to space.” His eyes lit up as he reminisced on his memories. “And now, I can't go back. Everyone in the Martian gravity is stuck. Bones, muscles, and hearts too weak for Earth.” There was a hint of resignation in his voice.

""You know,"" she said finally, ""when I signed up for the force, I thought I'd be chasing smugglers and bar brawls, not unraveling biotech conspiracies with corporate death tolls.”

“Yeah? Well, you chose that career path when you were 10 and still in school.” Adam let out a harsh huff. “Still can't believe your parents let you do that.”

Ares gave him a flat look. “Well I didn't have much choice.” She rubbed the back of her neck, looking off to the side. “Mom… well, she thought discipline meant responsibility. Figured the badge would keep me out of trouble. And Dad… Well, he believed you either signed up early or ended up working sanitation or pressurized farming. And I'd personally rather eat lead than pick hydroponic algae off filters for the next thirty years.”

Adam smirked faintly, his eyes scanning the hallway ahead. “Fair.”

A faint beep echoed from Adam’s datapad, drawing both their gazes. He pulled it out, eyes narrowing as he flicked through the alert. The signal wasn’t from HQ. It was unregistered and had no header. “It won't be her.” Is all it said.

“Fucking spam.” Adam paid it no mind, deleting the message.

“Hm? What was that?” Ares didn't entirely hear him.

“Oh, nothing. Just got a spam message.” Adam waved it off. “Probably gotta get this thing a factory reset again.”

“Pfft. No kidding, huh?” Ares chortled.

Adam slid the datapad back into his coat and resumed walking, the echo of their steps mingling with the low, ever-present hum of the precinct’s infrastructure. Ares fell silent beside him again, her expression unreadable. Her amber eyes looked off as if deep in thought.

As they reached the main floor, the distant buzz of the precinct’s daytime activity started bleeding through the quieter halls behind them. Phones rang. Distant voices bickered. Somewhere, a coffee machine let out an exhausted sputter like it was dying for the third time this week.

Ares seemed to straighten up, the lingering sleepiness replaced by a professional alertness, though her eyes still held a weariness drilled in behind the bags hanging under them. She adjusted her jacket, her gaze sweeping the bullpen with a practiced nonchalance as her muscles tensed.

They navigated the maze of desks, ignoring the curious glances and the occasional half-hearted greeting. Adam’s office door was still slightly ajar, just as they’d left it. He pushed it open, the scent of stale cigarette smoke hitting him immediately. He exhaled deeply. “Gonna have to air this shit out for a week.”

Ares had the decency to look slightly sheepish, grabbing the offending ashtray from his desk and dumping the butts into the waste bin beside it. “Sorry. Force of habit.”

“Habit my ass, you brought that in from outside this morning.” Adam’s brow furrowed but released immediately after.

Adam sank into his worn office chair, the faux leather groaning under his weight as if mirroring his own exhaustion. He ran a hand over his face, the stubble rasping against his palm. The lingering scent of Ares’s cigarettes mingled unpleasantly with the dusty files stacked precariously on the corner of his desk. He leaned forward, elbows resting on the scratched surface, and stared blankly at the wall opposite. It was covered in case notes, grainy surveillance stills, and jurisdictional maps and yet it didn't feel important.

His gaze eventually drifted down to the datapad Bruce had tossed onto the desk earlier. Cold. Official. Impersonal. He picked it up, the weight feeling heavier than it should, the smooth plasti-steel cool against his fingertips. He thumbed it active, the screen flaring to life with the Epsilon incident report header. Fifteen names. Fifteen dead ends, potentially.

Ares shifted her weight near the doorframe, arms crossed, watching him. She didn't speak, giving him the space, but her presence was a quiet reminder that they were still on the clock, that the silence wouldn't last.

“Three bureaucrats, a board member's son, the head of agriculture’s wife, a veteran detective’s wife, and nine unrelated individuals.” Adam stared at the datapad, his gaze was almost fierce enough to burn a hole through it. “Three engineers, two researchers, and four resource transports.” Adam thought long and hard about it. “What were they trying to do?” Engineers and researchers made a twisted kind of sense; maybe they were involved in the prototype that failed, or a different, more sinister project. Resource transporters… perhaps they moved sensitive materials, saw something they shouldn’t have? But bureaucrats? The head of agriculture’s wife? And Roseanne… his Roseanne? None of it clicked.

Ares shifted, leaning against the doorframe, her arms still crossed. The silence stretched, punctuated only by the distant hum of the precinct and the occasional sputter of the dying coffee machine down the hall. “Looks like a damn shotgun blast, pattern-wise,” she finally said, her voice low. “Either it’s random, or the connection’s buried deep.”

“What if it's broad for a reason?” Adam stroked the stubble on his chin, the rough scrape against his fingers a grounding sensation against the maelstrom that was his train of thought.

Ares shifted again, leaning her shoulder against the worn metal doorframe. “You mean, like a smokescreen?” she offered, her voice low and pragmatic. “Throw enough random targets into the mix, and nobody sees the real one?”

Adam considered it, nodding slowly. “Maybe. But what's the motive? Why kill the people at the top? Was it the people at the top?” He paused. “We still don't have the full picture.”

“Cruelty doesn’t need a reason.” Ares countered softly, her usual cynicism tinged with a hint of softness.

“Why keep the bodies alive? That'd just cost money. Something Epsilon Prosthetics wouldn't take lightly.” Adam's brow furrowed further, he slammed his fist down onto the table. “Damnit.”

Adam’s fist remained clenched on the worn surface of the desk, the knuckles white. The sharp sting grounded him for a moment, acting as a lightning rod.

“It doesn’t track,” he finally muttered, voice low and rough. He leaned back in the chair, the worn springs groaning in protest. “Epsilon cuts corners everywhere else. Safety regulations, employee benefits… they pinch sols like their lives depend on it. So why spend resources keeping fifteen husks plugged into life support? Disposal is cheaper. Quieter.”

Ares leaned back against the doorframe again, crossing her arms once more. The synthetic fabric of her jacket rustled softly in the quiet office. “Unless the bodies are the resource,” she countered, her voice flat, devoid of inflection but heavy with implication. “Or keeping them ‘alive,’ quote unquote, serves some other purpose. Legal loophole? PR stunt gone wrong? Maybe they need plausible deniability. It can’t be murder if they’re technically not dead yet.”

“It'd still be a negligence charge, assault, medical malpractice, I mean hell, homicide, involuntary manslaughter, potential terrorism, tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice. We're talking civil lawsuits and criminal lawsuits. It doesn't matter if they're bodies are still alive, there's no loophole there. They are legally dead.” Adam ran his fingers through his hair. “All they need to do is throw some poor bastards under the bus.”

After a moment of silence, the door handle rattled just before Bruce walked in.

“Alright,” Bruce’s voice, gravelly from years of recycled air and probably too little sleep, cut through the heavy atmosphere in the small office. He didn’t knock, just pushed the door fully open, his bulky frame filling the doorway. His eyes, bloodshot and shadowed, swept over Adam at his desk, then flicked to Ares still sitting on said desk. He held a datapad loosely in one hand. “Heard you listing charges, Thourne. Find anything solid enough to make one stick, or are we just spitballing felonies for fun?”

“Still on the motive. I hope you transferred the data over to some sort of specialist.” Adam said.

Bruce grunted, stepping fully into the office and letting the door click shut behind him. The small space suddenly felt even more cramped. “Forensics has it. Pulled one of the tech analysts off the MarsNet security detail to decrypt whatever Epsilon’s trying to hide in those personnel files you snagged. Don’t expect miracles overnight.” He tossed his own datapad onto the corner of Adam’s desk, adding to the clutter. It landed with a dull thud. “And yeah, I got the data. Clean transfer, no traceable origin.” He gave Ares a hard look. “Your drive?”

“We think there's a mole or a whistle blower.” Ares responded, pushing off the desk to stand properly, her boots making barely a sound on the worn tile. “It should've given us access, but we didn't send anything.”

Bruce’s gaze sharpened, his expression shifting from procedural annoyance to something harder, more calculating. He looked from Ares back to Adam, then down at the datapad on the desk as if expecting it to offer an explanation. “Not you?” he repeated, his voice dropping lower. “Then who the hell sent it? You’re telling me some ghost in the machine just decided to forward classified Epsilon data straight to my secure line using an untraceable relay?”

Ares nodded curtly. “That’s what happened. The drive I used has firewall breakers and data extraction protocols, yeah, but nothing for anonymous, encrypted transmission like that. Someone was already inside their system, piggybacked on my connection when I plugged in, and pushed the data out.” She tapped a finger against her temple. “They knew where to send it, too. Your direct comm channel isn't exactly public knowledge.”

“It might be one of the victims’ families, friends, or maybe just a white hat hacker. We've got nothing on ‘em.” Adam replied, his voice low and steady. “White hat hacker seems unlikely, given the target. Epsilon’s security isn’t something script kiddies crack for kicks. Families or friends… maybe. Grief makes people do drastic things. But this felt… coordinated. Precise.”

Bruce ran a thick hand over his jaw, his eyes narrowed, scanning the small office as if searching for hidden microphones or unseen observers. The air crackled with unspoken suspicion. “Coordinated,” he echoed, the word tasting like grit in his mouth. “Or planted. You think Epsilon doesn’t have assets capable of spoofing a transfer like that? Feed us data they want us to see? Lead us down a rabbit hole while they scrub the real evidence?”

“Occam's razor. Why go the extra mile when you could just deny it? If they wanted to screw us up, they wouldn't give false information. They'd give misleading information.” Adam’s sentence hung in the air, sharp and unfinished. “Just like the other six bodies we found first,” he completed, his voice regaining its low, gravelly edge. “Misdirection. That was their angle… This other individual led us directly to the correct bodies.”

Bruce’s heavy silence filled the cramped office. He scrubbed a hand over his face again, the rasp loud in the quiet room. The logic was sound, annoyingly so. Epsilon’s first move, the decoy bodies, fit a pattern of corporate obfuscation. This anonymous data drop, leading them straight to the actual victims, including the board member's son and Adam's wife… that felt different. Less like a calculated corporate play, more like… sabotage. 

“Alright,” Bruce finally conceded, his tone thick with weariness and suspicion. “So we have an unknown player. A ghost in their wires, maybe.” He spat the words out like they left a bad taste. “Doesn’t make me trust the data. Could still be a trap within a trap. Maybe they want us focused on these fifteen, while something else slips by.”

“Could be,” Adam acknowledged. “So, let's keep an eye on it, no?”

Last May, I was diagnosed with H. pylori (I think I got it from a taco truck, but that’s just my guess) and went through the triple therapy antibiotics.

I’ve been dealing with severe bloating for over a year now. At first, I thought it was celiac or a gluten intolerance, so I cut out gluten..but it didn’t make a difference.

Two weeks ago, I had my first endoscopy, and the doctor said I have chronic gastritis and extensive intestinal metaplasia. My villi looked fine, so they ruled out celiac, but he did say I have high stomach acid.

Now I’m on pantoprazole 20mg and taking a daily multivitamin (daily vite). This is day 5 on the PPI, but honestly, I feel more gassy than before. I’ve already cut out coffee (ouch), sugar, citrus, and acidic foods.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Any advice on what’s helped with bloating in your case? I'm a little scared to attach a picture of my stomach but heck this. Here's my bloated self.

1kciltl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kciltl/uncover_the_true_flavor_profile_of_dunkin/,Uncover the true flavor profile of Dunkin Original Blend Coffee review!,"Testing out the Dunkin' 881334002980 Original Blend Medium Roast Coffee K-Cup Pods has been an interesting and equally enjoyable experience for an avid coffee enthusiast like me. This product is marketed as offering the familiar Dunkin’ taste right from the comfort of home, without the need to visit a drive-thru. After using these pods daily for two weeks with my Keurig, I found both merits and flaws worth discussing, creating a candid review.

**Easy, Convenient Coffee Pods**

I don’t know about you, but weekday mornings can be chaos in my kitchen. Between getting my kids ready for school and mustering up the energy to tackle the day, brewing a traditional pot of coffee isn’t always feasible. These K-Cup pods provided a convenient solution. Each pod is perfectly portioned, popping easily into my coffee machine with minimal hassle. No scooping coffee grounds, no filters—just fast, mess-free coffee. For anyone juggling busy mornings or tight schedules, this convenience is a real lifesaver.

[Ready to snag Dunkin' 881334002980? See the Amazon price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00xa1075y/)

**Classic Dunkin' Flavor, Home Edition**

One of the biggest draws of this product was how true it stays to the original Dunkin’ coffee taste. If you’ve ever visited a Dunkin’ location and fallen in love with their rich and smooth medium roast, this K-Cup delivers that signature flavor almost identically. The premium Arabica beans used in these pods were certainly noticeable. The coffee is full-bodied without being overpowering, and oddly enough, I found it paired surprisingly well with both sweet and savory breakfast options. While I’m not one to drink milk or sugar in my coffee, my partner insists the product is just as satisfying with added cream and a dash of vanilla syrup.

**Perfect Roast Level for Most Tastes**

For someone who has tried everything from light to dark roasts, the medium roast of these pods hit the perfect balance. It’s strong enough to pack a caffeine punch for sluggish mornings without crossing into bitter, overpowering territory. That said, I discovered that over-extracting the coffee by using a larger cup size diluted its flavor. To truly enjoy it, sticking to the 8-ounce setting is critical; anything more than that risks stretching the brew too thin.

**Benefits**

- No mess, no fuss preparation.  
- Rich, smooth, and classic Dunkin’ taste.  
- Compatible with Keurig coffee makers for added convenience.  

**Critiques**

- Flavor feels diluted at larger cup sizes.  
- Limited to Keurig brewers, restricting compatibility with other machines.  

**Sustainability Concerns**

Something many coffee drinkers are asking today—how eco-friendly is your morning cup? Unfortunately, the pods used here aren’t biodegradable or compostable. While Dunkin’ K-Cups are marked as recyclable, the process still requires you to separate components like the foil lid and plastic cup. For someone trying to cut down single-use plastics at home, this could be a bit of a downside.

**Competing Products**

When comparing these Dunkin’ pods to other single-serve coffee options, Starbucks and Green Mountain come to mind as direct competitors. Starbucks tends to cater to those looking for stronger coffee with deeper, bolder dark roast options, whereas Dunkin’ skews more towards smooth, approachable flavors that suit wider palates. Green Mountain Coffee pods, meanwhile, offer a broader variety of blends, particularly for flavored roasts, making them more appealing to adventurous coffee drinkers. However, in terms of accessibility and mimicking the coffee shop experience, Dunkin’s pods take the lead—it’s simpler to replicate your trusty medium roast coffee from in-store.

**Quality for Price**

Considering the ease of use and premium coffee beans, the cost of this product seems reasonable. Of course, opting for single-serve pods usually means paying slightly more per cup than standard ground coffee, but for me, the payoff comes in the convenience. Personally, I’d say Dunkin’s offering is worth every penny for anyone who needs a quick, no-mess coffee solution with consistent quality. For comparison, buying smaller boxes locally was pricier when calculated per pod, making this pack of 60 a preferable option for home use.

I’m 29, moving from Durham, NC for grad school at WashU. I have a dog who loves long walks and I’m someone who loves being in a walkable community, but don’t mind walking/taking the bus to campus so walkability to campus isn’t as important as walkability to coffee shops, bars, green spaces, etc. 

My budget is around $1600 (ideally a bit less) for a one or two bedroom and I love historical old houses/apartments. I’d love to have a little outdoor space like patio but also not a dealbreaker especially if I’m close to green space. I loooove a historical home/space. 

Anyway, I visited STL for like 36 hours last week and in driving around was really drawn to the vibe in CWE so have focused my searching there. It seems I could get more space and character for my buck in Shaw, but it just felt like there was maybe less going on walkability wise there (grocery store, coffee shops, bookstores, you know) than in CWE.

This is a common issue with her. She hates me going out, even though I actually don't even go out much. I'm home with her every night, as I would rather stay home and play with our 2 year old son. 

When I go out, she expects me to just go for an hour. Whenever I go grocery shopping after work, she questions me about why it took me so long. This is incredibly annoying. Plus she's always making comments insinuating that I'm cheating or with other women. 

I give her access to my phone and laptop, since I have nothing to hide. When I get a WhatsApp notification she always asks me who it is. The other day I showed her a funny meme, and her first thought was ""who sent it to you?""

How do I solve her insecurities and accusations? I really didn't get to know my wife very well before marriage, but she's uneducated, not very social, didn't really go out and learn about life, and basically was raised living under a rock. I hate to say negative things about her, but we're very incompatible. Her knowledge of the the world is very limited. 

She's not pleasant to be around and I just don't enjoy her company. But I come home every day after work to be with her and my son. She expects us to go out often, out to restaurants and coffee shops and shopping and taking trips. Even though her family comes from a village and they never went out anywhere.

1kcie4a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcie4a,Big people and little people living room... This or that?,"Help me pick my little kid couch! More options at the link below.

  
We moved into this house and originally had it formal family room in front and play room in back. Looked messy so we went to sofa/tv in back and 4 chair conversation room in front. Hated it so were going back to front area family room and ""formal soft play"" room in the back LOL. I found the cutest sofas and coffee table setups online at House of Noa, but cant decide what works.... And anything other feedback? Last pages are current room (Were painting the room white because its dark and the grey floors are going!) Wall decor is a mystery to me too so let me know your thoughts!

My name Tarek, and I'm a professional squash coach from Egypt with over 10 years of experience coaching junior and senior players, including national-level athletes. I’ll be visiting Germany in mid-May for 1–2 months and would love to connect with squash coaches, players, or clubs during my stay.

My goal is to explore the squash scene in Germany, exchange knowledge, and possibly find opportunities for coaching or collaboration. I'm happy to assist with training sessions, hit with players, or simply meet over coffee to talk squash.

If you're based in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, or anywhere nearby, feel free to reach out. I’d really appreciate any advice, contacts, or chances to get involved in the community while I'm there.

Thanks in advance!",2,1746130303.0,squash,1,1.0,False
