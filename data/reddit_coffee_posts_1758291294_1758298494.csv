I frantically played Pokémon Reborn (it’s a fan game) a few months ago. Even though a few things are pretty infuriating, I really love this game and it being for more adult people, cuz through all these shitty characters you only realize how much others are angels and sweethearts. After playing a bit, I felt like I can't play any further until I have contributed anything wholesome/cool myself regarding Pokémon to the internet, so here we goo! The story is heavily inspired by one of the npcs in the early Wards of the game. Enjoy reading the script or else my {Pachirisu} will ***charge beam*** you until you do! ;)

SPOKEN WORD COUNT: approx. **2250** words  
in comparison: with context: approx. 3520 words - so there’s just a LOT of context

\------------------------

  


CONTEXT: **FOR VA’s:**

You’re a participant in the Pokémon League tournament, where you fight against other trainers in Pokémon battles to climb to the top and be the one who’s allowed to fight against the Elite Four and the Champion of your region. You just won the semi-final battle, it was a tough one, but in the end, your Pokémon showed all their power and won the fight for you in a brilliant way. After bringing your buddies to Nurse Joy so she can heal their injuries, you head out of the medical area and into the public lounge of the Pokémon center with your thoughts still racing when you are suddenly addressed by a kind stranger.



**FOR LISTENER:**

Finally, it’s time for the annual Pokémon league tournament of your region, where Pokémon trainers from the whole world come together to battle against each other and clarify who becomes the Champion of your nation. You aren’t a trainer but a visitor who bought a ticket to see the battles, and one of the participants manages to fascinate you in particular. {They} have a very different fighting style from other trainers and easily won the first few battles without a problem until the semi-final one you just witnessed which had been a pretty close one. Now, after the battle and back in the Pokémon center, you spot the trainer you just saw in the semi-final. So why not go over to them and address them nicely - You wouldn’t harm anyone by doing it in a respectful way, right? 

  
  
  


\--------------**SCRIPT \_ \_ START**\------------

**\*door slides open, footsteps come closer, door closes.**   
**Somewhere in the Poké-Center there are speakers which play gentle lofi-ish music during the whole script (the music isn't necessary though),**   
**silent chatter of other people in the background. You, the VA gave away your Pokémon for Nurse Joy to heal them.\***  
 **\*Footsteps slowly towards the listener as you now return from the counter into the launch area of the Pokémon-Center.\***   
**\*You hum the Pokémon-Center-melody from the video games for a few seconds.(**[here’s an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6z1CH4oX2o) **if you need an inspiration)\***



**\[\*listener approaches you asking whether you participated in the Pokémon tournament today\*\]**

**\*surprised:\***Oh hey, yes I participated in the tournament today, you remember correctly. I assume you were watching in the stadium, then? 

**\[\*confirms that they watched the tournament. They compliment the battle skills of you and your Pokémon\*\]** 

**\*honest appreciation voice\*** Why, thank you! The battle was really a tough one. The other trainer and their Pokémon were so strong, I honestly thought we wouldn't win against them.   
But hey, together we made it - and I’m so proud of my team.  
Though the most important thing is that my friends didn't get seriously hurt during the fight.   
I just gave them to Nurse Joy to check on them, and she quickly confirmed that they don't seem to be badly injured. 

I guess I'll see them in a few minutes again. They really deserve a reward after such a hard battle... 



**\*short silence. Then sigh, voice more heavy, honest, a lot more tired suddenly, shoulders drop down:\***   
By Arceus, am I glad that the tournament is nearly over. I hope it was entertaining for the crowd at least. 

**\[\*feeling the mood shift, listener assures you that it definitely was exciting to watch, they ask whether you experienced the energy emitted by the croud. And they ask whether doing Pokémon battles isn't your thing\*\]**

**\*you think back to the atmosphere the crowd emitted as you and your Pokémon fought alongside each other\***   
It seemed like it was, judging by the cheers you could hear on the battlefield. 

**\*still sounding a bit tired\***   
**\*sigh\***   
And yeah you concluded right, doing Pokémon-battles isn't really my cup of tea...   
I don't like the idea of forcing my Pokémon to fight for me for the sake of entertainment.   
That just... seems unnecessarily cruel. 

**\*short silence, then quickly added behind:\***  
Well as this is my personal opinion I'm not to judge other people who think differently and fight together with their Pokémon for that reason. 

It's simply… **\*heavy breath\*** not my style.

**\[\*Then why did you enter the tournament then?\*\]**

Well, that's actually a pretty good question.

**\*short silence\*** 

**\*then slow speaking:\***  
But to answer why I entered the tournament, I must first provide some more information - and I'd like to get myself some tea. 

So are you in a hurry or...?

**\[\*They tell you they have enough time, since they'd really like to hear your story\***  
**\*comment was very cute\*\]** 

**\*Their enthusiastic answer really surprised you, which is why you ended up laughing really hard\***

**\*chuckles lightheartedly, voice warm and amused sounding:\***   
Well it isn't *\_that\_* special but It's interesting to talk to a person who seems to be so willing to listen to my story for once. 

**\*still amused - after laughing hard it's difficult to be serious again\***   
Doesn't happen that often I have to admit - and it's quite flattering. 

**\*small chuckle, from now on voice sounds more at ease again, laughing had lifted the fatigue from you\*** Even though I'm not sure whether your expectations are too high. 

**\*another small chuckle\*** Daaamn, your enthusiastic comment caught me off guard... 

**\*hem\*** Okay, let me grab some tea, and then we can chat while I wait for my Pokémon.

  


**\*sound of footsteps as VA and listener head towards the bar. VA to the person at the counter\***   
Good afternoon, I'd like a Sunflorean Tea, please. 

**\\\*Person behind the counter, tone friendly, professional,**   
**you might just alter your voice here:\*\\**   
\\Good evening! One Sunflorean tea. Do you want anything else?\\

**\*To the listener:\*** Do you want to drink something too? I'd buy it for you. 

**\[\*The listener agrees to drink something too. They go with Sinelberry-moomoo-Milk\*\]** 



Alright then! 

**\*to the worker:\*** And one Sinelberry-moomoo-Milk too please. 

\\We got one Sunflorean Tea and the Moomoo-Milk. Comes in a few seconds.   
You pay together... This makes 400 Poké-dollars please!\\

Alright, I'll pay with cash. There you go '  
**\*You hand over the money to the barista\***

\\Thank you very much. Just sit down, I'll bring you your drinks in a second.\\

  


**\*sound of footsteps and moving chairs as you and Listener walk towards a free table and sit down on\*** 

**\*you get back on track to where you were in the conversation:\***  
Sooo, where were we? 

**\[\*short silence, or listener helps you get back on track. Decide for yourself\*\]**

**\*getting back on track\*** Ah yes, why I entered the tournament if I don't like Pokémon battles: 

**\*You mentally prepare yourself to share a part of your life to listener:\***   
You see, at the moment I'm actually leading a gym in a small town called {Gonsentweak}.  
But it's not really the profession of my dreams and more like a job I'm currently doing. 

Before me, my parents led the gym but they quit a bit over a year ago.   
So as their only child I had to inherit their job from them, as long as we didn’t find another person worthy of doing it.

**\*short silence\***

When I was a child, I wanted to become a Pokémon trainer like so many other people.   
But after I started my own journey, I slowly began to realize that I more so enjoy teaching Pokémon new moves…  
…or simply taking care of them, rather than encouraging Pokémon to fight against one another.  
This thought process started when I caught a rather shy and peaceful {Poliwag}, which decided not to fight in a battle for me after I caught them as my {third} Pokémon. 

**\*short pause to let the said sink\***

At first I was hella confused why they wouldn't want to, but instead of being mad, I tried to be patient with them and understand the thought process behind their behaviour.

The thing is: On one hand, my {Poliwag} seemed very shy when it was dealing with me or my other Pokémon.   
On the other hand, it could show its brave sides too when dealing with wild creatures.  
  


**\*you start to retell a specific memory\***  
I remember the day as if it were only a week ago when we had a cozy picnic on a sunny day, sitting under a tree, us four, just enjoying the rest after a hard training session.   
Then {Poliwag} suddenly straightened and got nervous, locking their eyes onto a certain spot in the distance.   
It quickly ran into the direction its eyes had been locked on before, us following right behind.

Turns out, it had sensed another Pokémon being fanatically chased by another trainer and their helpers. 

**\*short pause\***

**\*shortly dipping out of the memory, interrupting yourself with the following observation\***

You might ask yourself where the red line was crossed, if there's a red line regarding catching Pokémon and how I ended up in a team with my partners in the first place. 

Well... **\*you get interrupted as you hear the footsteps of the barista coming closer as they bring you your order\***



**\*barista, voice friendly and professional again:\***  
 \\Here's the Sunflorean tea for ya\\

**\*places it right in front of you\***  
\\And the sinelberry-moomoo-milk for you...\\

**\*places the milkshake in front of listener\***  
\\Enjoy your drinks!\\

**\*sound of barista walking away/back to their counter\***  


**\*from now on: occasional sounds of you taking a sip/stir with the spoon in your drink for a second before taking a sip and placing the cup back down again.**   
**<-- You might do it as often as you please and now or later by adding these effects\***

**\*you start talking again, returning to retell your memory:\*** 

Actually I hadn't thought about how I'm supposed to befriend my partners before seeing this trainer hunting the {Ducklett} with the help of an {Alolan Geodude} in such an aggressive way… - I just did somehow befriend them.

**\*The following sentence with a hint of sharpness, not directed towards listener, just... into the void:\***  
You see, it was very *\_obvious\_* that the {Ducklett} didn't want to get caught by them ‘cause it was trying to flee from Geodude. 

Maybe it'd tried to fight but Geodude was clearly in advantage over them, so that's why it tried to escape at the end.

But as it did and tried to fly away it was hit by a rock throw or thunder attack and fell down again and again. 

**\*soft and short break\***

**\*taking a sip from your tea\***

So that's what we saw when we ran towards the battle, {Poliwag} a few steps ahead of us.

As the {Ducklett} heard us coming closer - it made a face I will never be able to get out of my head.

**\*soft and feeling still the impact:\***  
It'd looked so scared, probably thinking that we were allies of the other douchebag trainer.

But {Poliwaq} made it pretty clear that we weren’t \_ as it quickly attacked Geodude when it was near enough with a precisely aimed mudshot knocking them out. 

**\*Sounding somewhat proud, thinking back on {Poliwag} saving the wild {Ducklett}:\***   
From this day, {Poliwag} wasn't shy anymore. 

**\*musing, a bit amused\***   
But it still doesn't really want to do trainer fights. 

**\*you conclude the story about the little** \[**Ducklett} with the following sentence. Your voice turns serious again:\***  
What I learned from this event is: Most people think about catching Pokémon that it's a valid strategy to force them to join your team - but since you're dealing with a living species, it's not. 

**\*taking a sip from your tea\***

\[Hm I think I understand. Just battling wild Pokémon and catching them even if they showed signs of NOT wanting to be catched at all sounds much crueler to me now.   
I hadn't spent any thoughts on this until this event... Yanking them out of their living environment and maybe even family...\]

Exactly! Pokémon have their own life and family too and I feel like there are a lot of trainers who don't respect that.

So if you want to bond with a Pokémon, watch their body language, you can open a duel but if they show signs of not being willing to fight, don't force them. 

I caught my {Pachirisu} in a battle but {she} was actually the one who provoked ME into it and not the other way around. 

\[How's that? What did they do?   
**\*looks at you curiously\*\]** 

**\*thinking back on how you met {Pachirisu}, a smile is lighting up on your face:\***   
This little cheekster was spying on us from the top of a tree as my {Chikorita} and I were walking through the forest below {her}. 

{She} decided to throw some small fruits, or build other traps that collapsed right in front of us to spook us and then steal a snack from out of my bag when our focus was still on the trap we’d nearly ran into. 

**\*you smile into your cup of tea and take a sip\***

{She} actually just wanted our attention and us to declare a battle against {her}.   
The battle ended quite close but {she} lost. 

So I caught {her} and after calling {her} out of {her} Pokéball {she} clearly communicated that {she’s} happy to be at our side. I guess that’s what {she} wanted from the moment she attacked us first

\[**\*genuine, maybe a bit amused, but more happy to hear this wholesome interaction\***  
That sounded really wholesome.   
And interesting that {she} was so eager to join you that {she} even started to taunt you into it\]

Yeah, I was a bit confused about it too but {she’s} super cute actually! Kind of stereotypical for an electric type.   
**\*small chuckle\***

Anyway, this train of conversation really traveled far away from the destination it was intended to arrive at. Let’s get back on track, shall we?

\[sure   
**\*nods their head or anything similar\***   
Even though I didn’t mind this small divagation.\]

**\*honest, casual\***  
I’m glad\^\^. Alright, we were talking about why I entered the tournament. 

So after the incident with the {Geodude} trainer, as my Pokémon and I tried to comfort the {Ducklett}, I realized that I really enjoyed just talking to it and tending to its wounds. 

From there I got the idea of trying to train with wild Pokémon so they could protect themselves against other unwanted trainers.   
It actually kind of worked well and in the process I found other fellow Pokémon that wanted to stay by my side and travel with me through the lands.

**\*you take a sip of your tea again\***

To get a better idea of Pokémon fights and tactics trainers might use, I started to challenge a few Gym leaders and earned a few badges.   
But I never intended to actually fight against the Elite Four or anything. 

After maybe two or three years of traveling, my parents asked me to come to help them out with their Gym.   
They wanted me to lead the Gym only for some time since they wanted to go on a journey for themselves.

**\*short pause, taking another sip\***

 **\*voice gets heavier again as your mood sinks thinking back about leading the Gym when all you wanted was to be out there in the wild and take care of wild Pokémon:\***

At first it was only for a short period of time. But as you might’ve guessed…

\[...Something happened and they decided to quit leading the Gym for an uncertain period.\]

**\*voice getting a bit heavy\***  
…You’re right. When they came back from their vacation, they told me that they planned to quit being the Gym leaders and asked me to be the new one instead.

**\*voice sounding a bit resigned:\***  
Since I needed the money, I accepted and now here I am, still the Gym leader of {Gonsentweak}, for two years already. 

When I was not needed in the Gym, I was spending every minute out in nature, playing with wild Pokémon or just relaxing there, reading a book,...

**\*taking another sip. Sound of a teacup being placed back on the table.\***

**\*voice sounding less resigned now since you’re getting to the part where you might be able to find a better occupation:\***  
I searched for a person who could replace me as the new leader, and after a while, I think I found someone who might be my successor. 

But since I still needed a way to earn money, I applied to be a Pokémon Ranger.

And here we get to the point why I participated in the tournament, ‘cause I applied to work in a National Park where Pokémon can live in peace.

The ranger association wants to make sure that I got a lot of experience as a trainersince I need to be able to protect the wild Pokémon against dangers. 

Like other trainers who might still try to harm or catch Pokémon and aren’t shying away from opening a battle against me -   
even though hunting is against the rules of the National Park.

**\*you take a sip\***

\[Oh this makes a lot of sense, I get it.   
**\*pauses speaking as they think about your story\***

**\*starts speak slowly (aka thoughtful)\***  
So it makes sense for you to participate in a known Pokémon tournament.   
But do you really plan on becoming the Champion of this Region just so you can become a Ranger?\]

**\*musing chuckle\***

**\[\*musing, half-joking\***   
I mean, \_*this\_* might be a very hard standard for hiring someone into their team…\]

**\*musing:\***  
Yeah, you’re right, Becoming the champion of a region \_*would\_* be an insanely high standard for hiring people into becoming a ranger.

**\*assuring:\***   
No, you just have to somehow prove that you’re good at doing Pokémon battles and that the chemistry between you and your Pokémon is intimate.

And with my original background of wanting to become a top-trainer, I thought this would be a good rounding off by becoming the winner of the tournament part of the Pokémon League. 

**\*rounding it up:\***  
So yeah, no, I’m not planning to fight against the Elite Four if I should win the tournament part against all the other trainers.  
And even if I don’t win the final battle, I think this might be enough to prove my skills.

**\*sound of a digital notification, e.g a ‘bling!’-sound. You say ‘apologetically’ as in interrupting your conversation\***

Oh, excuse me for a second, I just got the notification that my Pokémon are fully recovered.  
I still have about twenty minutes until I have to give some interviews about the final battle the day after tomorrow.

But if you want I’ll be right back and we can finish our drinks before I have to head off.

\[**\*assuring\***   
Yeah sure, but please don’t stress yourself if you don’t have any time left\]

Alright, be right back.  
**\*sound of standing up from your chair and then footsteps walking away\***  
  


**\*fade-out + fade-in\***



**\*sound of footsteps coming closer as you come back, you have your {Pachirisu} with you that’s sitting on your shoulder, in your hand you have a pack of PokéSnax\***

Hey there :)!        Wait, {Pachi}, you’ll get your PokéSnax once I sit down.

**\*sound of you sitting down on the chair again\***  
**\*You open the Snax package\***

There you go\~

**\*{Pachirisu} climbs down to your lap as they happily nibble on their PokéSnax\***

\[So this is the \[Pachirisu} you were talking about, I see\]

**\*You smile at listener as you start to talk to them again,**   
**tone casual, light-hearted\***  
Yes, {she} is.

The other Pokémon were happy to be able to retreat into their Pokéballs for some time, while this little energetic fella hates to stay inside {her} ball, so {she’s} outside all the time. 

I guess {she} just loves to jump around a lot - {she} never gets tired.   
**\*chuckle\***  


\[I wonder: How did you manage collecting all the necessary badges, while still being in charge of the gym if I may ask? Or did you collect them while you were still on your journey?\]

I actually didn’t collect every gym badge, ‘cause you’re right, this would’ve been quite hard with me being a leader at the same time. 

No, I took the Pokémon League Admission Exam to gain access to the league instead. 

\[Pokémon League Admission Exam? Never heard of this before. What is this?\]

**\*taking a sip from your tea\***

Ah, I heard that it’s not a really familiar thing.

Well you see, the PLAE is a possibility to participate in the Pokémon League without the need to travel all the time and collect the badges which will take a lot of time some people don’t have. 

Because they have a job for example. One part of the exam is leading Pokémon battles with Pokémon that aren’t theirs to test their battling skill.  
And other parts are written exams where you have to guess the right Pokémon from only seeing a small part of their body and answer other questions.

\[Ah I’ve never actually heard of this but it’s a good thing that this test exists for people who aren’t able to travel due to different reasons.\]

It really is, yeah. I mean, otherwise I would’ve participated in another tournament but being able to participate in this one really leaves a great expression in my portfolio.

Also because doing the PLAE and still becoming the battle champion is very hard to accomplish. 

  
**\*taking the last sips of your tea, slowly wrapping up the conversation\***  
So this is my story, 

**\*joking tone:\***  
I hope you found it entertaining.

**\[\*feeling the situation changing you go with it. Honest tone:\***  
Well entertaining sounds like the wrong word but it \_*was*\_ a pleasure to listen to your story!\]

I’m glad to hear that :) 

**\*musing\***  
I wonder whether I’m going to tell the same story to my interviewers or not.

**\*short pause\***

**\*then, a funny thought crosses your head:\***

Wait, you aren’t secretly a person from the media and just very subtly found a way to interview me, am I right?  
  
**\[\*laughs wholeheartedly\***  
Oh I can assure you that I’m not, don’t worry! And I’d never do something like this even if I were from the media\]

I’m glad! 

**\*you gently take away the pack of PokéSnax from {Pachi} and put them in your pocket. To {Pachirisu}:\***

{Pachi} Are you ready to give another interview?

**\*{Pachirisu} looks at you curiously then excitedly makes a confirming sound\***

**\*You chuckle to yourself**   
**and you and listener both stand up from your chair and table\***

**\*back to listener:\***  
I really enjoyed the chat with you and hope you enjoy your stay and watching the final battle in two days if you’re going to stay this long.

\[Likewise, hope you have pleasant interviews and good luck for the final battle!   
And yeah, I won’t miss this final showdown, it seems to be very promising.   
…I hope you don’t me saying this even though you don’t like trainer battles\]

**\*you wave their concerns aside\***  
It’s okay, I understand what you want to say and really appreciate it :).  
Have a great stay and see you!

**\*You wave a goodbye as you and your {Pachirisu} walk off in unison.\***

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It opened to a text thread about meeting up with his ex girlfriend for coffee. So yeah, I looked through it. Scrolling back I see they’re texting semi-frequently (once a month or so). She apparently recently moved back to town. 

The thing is, we have very open communication about meeting up with people no matter who it is. We discuss our schedule. It’s not “letting” either of us go, it’s notifying each other where we’ll be. 

Especially now that we have a baby. 

But they set up these plans a few days ago. 

He’s said nothing about it. Last night I gave him a few chances to discuss it. “What are your plans Monday?” 

He said nothing about it. 

And that is eating at me. 

It could be totally innocent, but then why hide it? It’s not on our shared calendar. He hasn’t mentioned it. He sent her the meet up location within 24 hours of me finding out so I don’t think he’s forgotten. 

Do I bring it up now?
Do I show up? 
Do I bring it up afterwards? 
Do I just go see what happens? 

I don’t want to share our kid. I don’t want to lose my best friend. I don’t want to be divorced. 

Just why hide it? 

I’m so confused. This is not normal. 

I don’t even want to tell anyone my suspicions. But my gut feeling is that this is bad news. ",1,1758298096.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

My husband had been wanting me to get a laser cutter just for fun and looked into the m1 ultra, since it is considered the ultimate craft machine.

This year has been rough and incredibly stressful, having experienced 3 miscarriages (7 weeks, 16 weeks and just two months ago, 10 weeks) and deciding whether or not to pursue fertility treatment. Last month, my husband surprised me with the m1 ultra, hoping to help cheer me up and put my energy into being creative again and offer a distraction from baby things and it has amazing.

I've had it for about a month and a half now and am using it every single day. I'm inspired to be creative again, I'm excited and always thinking about what to make, and it has given me a new focus. I'm now preparing for my first craft show of the year next month and I'm super excited about what's next.

You can see some of things I've made so far, and I've got so many more ideas.

Congrats on making 5k subs here and thank you for keeping me going when things got hard, and giving me an outlet.

1nl7oog,https://i.redd.it/ucf7mwzia5qf1.png,The Mafia Queen Doesn’t Forgive—Cheaters Will Pay in Blood! Link?,"Chapter 1  
  
  
I was seven years older than Victor Drake when I first found him.  
  
  
He was a feral street rat, fighting wild dogs for scraps.  
  
  
Those eyes burned, locking on mine like a wolf.  
  
  
Savage. Dangerous. Perfect.  
  
  
So I dragged him out of that gutter and forged him from zero.  
  
  
Ten years. That’s all it took to forge a worthless beggar into NYC's most feared kingpin.  
  
  
Victor Drake was my masterpiece. My greatest creation.  
  
  
Until that pathetic little chick had the nerve to step in front of my car.  
  
  
She touched her pregnant belly with a sly smile and pressed play on her recorder.  
  
  
""Victor, who do you love more—me or that old bat?""  
  
  
Then came the voice I knew too well:  
  
  
""She’s just an old hag. All these years, the thing I hated most was her high-and-mighty attitude.""  
  
  
I sneered. It seemed that my little wolf forgot his place, had long forgotten the days he had crawled to me on his knees.  
  
  
The next day, I had his precious little secret delivered straight to Victor—a miscarriage report he’d never forget.  
  
  
Victor’s eyes were bloodshot as he pressed the gun to my forehead, speaking each word slowly:  
  
  
""Autumn.""  
  
  
I sipped my coffee, composed and unfazed.  
  
  
""Seems you've forgotten who made you, boy.""  
  
  
Victor's face darkened, his voice dripping with warning:  
  
  
""You really think I’m afraid to shoot?""  
  
  
He wasn't that scrawny kid anymore. Years of blood and violence had given him a quiet, deadly authority.  
  
  
I just shook my head with a cold smile:  
  
  
""If I were you, I’d cut the bullshit.""  
  
  
Victor froze as subtle sounds came from the floor-to-ceiling windows behind him.  
  
  
He turned around, his expression changing instantly.  
  
  
The girl hung outside the 72nd floor, hands bound, suspended over the abyss.  
  
  
Her white dress fluttered in the wind. Nothing but death waited below.  
  
  
""You’d better be careful.""  
  
  
I smiled, unfazed by the gun at my head.  
  
  
""After all, one wrong move and I'm dead—but your little princess becomes street pizza.""  
  
  
""Blown to pieces.""  
  
  
The girl sobbed hysterically:  
  
  
""Victor, save me!""  
  
  
Victor's eyes blazed crimson as he flicked off the safety.  
  
  
""Autumn, how dare you!""  
  
  
My bodyguards instantly surrounded us.  
  
  
The air crackled with violence.  
  
  
I waved them off lazily:  
  
  
""Get lost.""  
  
  
Without warning, I pulled out a blade and drove it deep into Victor's gut.  
  
  
He grunted, but pressed the gun harder against my skull.  
  
  
""Feel good?""  
  
  
I whispered to him like a lover, smiling.  
  
  
Victor's face stayed stone-cold:  
  
  
""Happy now? Let her go.""  
  
  
""Luna's different from you. She's just an innocent girl who doesn't understand this world.""  
  
  
Victor's men arrived quickly, pulling Luna Sterling to safety.  
  
  
I never planned to actually kill her anyway.  
  
  
I watched Victor cradle the trembling girl, whispering gentle words, treating her like priceless treasure.  
  
  
Suddenly, I felt utterly bored.  
  
  
He used to hold me exactly like that. After his enemies took their revenge—when I lost our child and could never bear another.  
  
  
She was almost full-term. We called her Summer.  
  
  
Victor built a church for Summer, spending millions on her memorial.  
  
  
He promised: ""Autumn, our daughter will be safe in the next life.""  
  
  
He wanted endless prayers and donations to bless Summer's soul.  
  
  
I once asked him why he did all this.  
  
  
Victor, unshaven and broken, spoke with absolute conviction:  
  
  
""Because Summer is my only child in this life. I will never betray you both.""  
  
  
Now I stared at the woman in Victor's arms.  
  
  
Victor, you broke your word. But that's fine—I'll help you remember your promise.  
  
  
The girl finished crying, her swollen eyes burning with hatred:  
  
  
""Victor, it’s her! The barren bitch is jealous that I can have your child!""  
  
  
Victor's expression shifted.  
  
  
He stroked the girl's hair gently, his voice eerily calm:  
  
  
""You crossed a line.""  
  
  
Luna's sobs caught in her throat.  
  
  
She didn't know that since losing Summer, no one dared mention children around us.  
  
  
It was the eternal wound Victor and I shared.  
  
  
No one told Luna the rules. She just kept crying, heartbroken and clueless.  
  
  
Victor lifted her unconscious form, pushed past me, and walked to the door.  
  
  
""Autumn, this isn’t over.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
I just never expected Victor's revenge to come so swiftly.  
  
  
Listening to my assistant Marcus's report, I absently stroked the cat on my lap.  
  
  
""Mr. Drake paid double to win that southern district lot.""  
  
  
""Mr. Drake secretly contacted shareholders, buying up equity.""  
  
  
""Mr. Drake... tore down the church built for the little miss.""  
  
  
My hand tightened, and the cat cried out, curling into my arms without daring to move.  
  
  
""Say that again?!""  
  
  
My expression was blank.  
  
  
Marcus gritted his teeth: ""Mr. Drake demolished the church. He said he wanted to... to build an amusement park for that mistress! Construction started this morning!""  
  
  
Bang!  
  
  
I hurled the cup beside me. It shattered into pieces.  
  
  
Marcus immediately lowered his head:  
  
  
""I'll handle it right away!""  
  
  
I waved my hand: ""I'll go myself.""  
  
  
By the time I arrived, half the church was already destroyed.  
  
  
Luna Sterling held a balloon in one hand, bouncing around directing the work:  
  
  
""Clean up that side better, and over here—Victor, I wanna build a carousel right here!""  
  
  
Victor just stood quietly beside the girl, watching her with a smile. Anyone seeing this scene would call them a perfect pair.  
  
  
If only they weren't destroying Summer's church.  
  
  
I stepped out of the car. Sharp eyes spotted me immediately, about to speak before my gun-drawing motion scared them silent.  
  
  
Luna turned around and saw me:  
  
  
""Miss Kane...""  
  
  
I raised my hand and fired.  
  
  
Luna's balloon burst on impact.  
  
  
""Ah!""  
  
  
She screamed and instinctively hid in Victor's arms.  
  
  
""You're fucking crazy!""  
  
  
Victor snarled.  
  
  
I said nothing, striding toward this pair of scum. I chambered another round with my left hand and fired again.  
  
  
After two shots, the site fell completely silent. Everyone was spooked by my actions like they'd seen a ghost in broad daylight.  
  
  
""Get out.""  
  
  
Victor frowned: ""Autumn.""  
  
  
""GET OUT!""  
  
  
I suddenly roared. After all these years, few people could make me lose control like this.  
  
  
No one dared speak.  
  
  
But Luna suddenly lifted her head from Victor's embrace, eyes full of provocation:  
  
  
""Miss Kane, why should the dead hoard so much? The living are what matters, aren't they?""  
  
  
Hearing Luna's words, Victor suddenly pulled her behind him, shielding her from my gun.  
  
  
He was afraid—afraid I'd hurt his girl.  
  
  
He knew damn well I would react to those words.  
  
  
""Autumn,"" Victor said, ""Summer is dead. We should all look forward.""  
  
  
""Hell, maybe it's better she was never born.""  
  
  
My finger trembled on the trigger:  
  
  
""What the fuck do you mean, Victor?""  
  
  
Victor's gaze held barely concealed mockery and... relish.  
  
  
Yes, relish.  
  
  
He said: ""You failed as a mother. All your sins—that's why you couldn't protect the child.""  
  
  
He was talking about the blood on my hands from when I was young, fighting to establish my position in New York.  
  
  
""Luna's different from you,"" Victor paused.  
  
  
""She's clean, pure. So she can have a child, while you’ve lost the right to ever be a mother.""  
  
  
After all these years, Victor knew exactly how to wound me.  
  
  
He was fearless:  
  
  
""Pull the trigger, Autumn. Right in front of Summer's church. Let her see what kind of monster her mother really is.""  
  
  
My hand began shaking. I couldn't keep the gun steady anymore.  
  
  
Marcus rushed up to support me.  
  
  
I pushed him away, waving my hand: ""I'm fine.""  
  
  
I'm fine, Summer. Mommy's fine. All these years, always fine.  
  
  
Mommy's sorry. I'm taking you home now.  
  
  
Father Michael emerged carrying a simple sandalwood box, personally placing Summer in my hands.  
  
  
I held the box like that night of wind and snow, cradling the formed fetus, wailing in the howling storm.  
  
  
If she were still alive, she'd be calling me mommy now.  
  
  
Victor watched me stagger, then suddenly spoke:  
  
  
""Autumn, I won't harm Summer. You can leave her here. This place will become an amusement park soon.""  
  
  
Luna chimed in:  
  
  
""Right, Miss Kane! After Victor and I have our child, she can be the big sister, watching over her little siblings from beneath the playground.""  
  
  
I ignored them.  
  
  
Victor released Luna and strode toward me, trying to grab my hand.  
  
  
My bodyguard's cold gun barrel met Victor's advance.  
  
  
My voice was hoarse:  
  
  
""Victor, the first thing I taught you was to sever all emotions and love.""  
  
  
""I always thought you hadn't learned it well enough. But I was wrong.""  
  
  
""From now on, Victor, you've graduated.""  
  
  
Between us—fight to the death.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
After that day, Victor never came home again.  
  
  
Until the auction two months later, where he appeared in a sharp suit with Luna Sterling on his arm. The pair looked like golden couple, basking in everyone's praise.  
  
  
""I heard Mr. Drake built an amusement park for Miss Sterling recently—even demolished a church!""  
  
  
Victor smiled at this:  
  
  
""I've found my salvation. Those old churches would just be dead weight.""  
  
  
Camera shutters clicked endlessly at his words.  
  
  
I stood on the second floor, looking down at this scene from above.  
  
  
Marcus stood beside me, clearly worried.  
  
  
Ever since I brought Summer home, I'd returned to the cold, arrogant CEO image everyone expected.  
  
  
In the midst of the crowd's chatter, Victor looked up and met my emotionless gaze.  
  
  
Few people in New York knew about our marriage.  
  
  
Three years ago, his business hit an insurmountable wall. By then, I'd already stepped back from his affairs.  
  
  
That rainy night, he knelt in the downpour, kowtowing step by step at my door, begging me to save him.  
  
  
I happened to need a husband to deal with family pressure.  
  
  
So I threw him a contract, promising that if he married me, I'd cover his debts.  
  
  
Victor agreed.  
  
  
He had only one condition.  
  
  
Keep our relationship private.  
  
  
""Autumn, I want to earn my place beside you through my own efforts.""  
  
  
I knew he was full of shit.  
  
  
No man could tolerate being beneath a woman for so long. Victor was no exception.  
  
  
He was just afraid that once word got out, he'd never shake the label of ""Kane's man.""  
  
  
Fine by me—I felt the same way.  
  
  
So we had an unspoken agreement: passionate nights in a private villa, then strangers in daylight.  
  
  
The auction items came and went, but I was barely interested.  
  
  
Until a plain pair of earrings was brought out. My expression finally changed.  
  
  
Those were what my grandmother had pawned seventy years ago when fleeing—part of her dowry.  
  
  
I raised my paddle without hesitation.  
  
  
They weren't particularly valuable, so few showed interest.  
  
  
I thought they were mine, until the little girl downstairs suddenly chirped:  
  
  
""I want those too!""  
  
  
The room erupted in good-natured laughter.  
  
  
So innocent. So cute.  
  
  
I looked down to see Victor leaning back regally in his chair, left hand raised, ready to back his little girl to the end.  
  
  
Catching my gaze, Victor smirked and mouthed ""sorry.""  
  
  
""My girl likes them, Autumn. Let her have them.""  
  
  
Looking away, I told Marcus: ""Continue.""  
  
  
Even when the $40,000 earrings hit over $80 million, Victor remained completely composed.  
  
  
""No-limit bid.""  
  
  
He suddenly grasped the girl's hand and declared loudly.  
  
  
Marcus frowned beside me:  
  
  
""Ms. Kane, where would Mr. Drake get that kind of cash flow?""  
  
  
I laughed coldly:  
  
  
""From his construction payments, obviously.""  
  
  
I gracefully bowed to the watching crowd and swept out.  
  
  
""Ms. Kane, what about the earrings?""  
  
  
I simply pressed my finger to his lips and whispered:  
  
  
""Remember—objects are always just dead things.""  
  
  
If my grandmother knew I'd blown money on earrings she pawned, she'd probably crawl out of her grave to kill me herself.

1nl7o5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nl7o5q/long_post_23m_caught_feelings_for_my_colleague/,LONG POST ⚠️(23M) caught feelings for my colleague (26F) and now the whole thing feels messy.,"Hey everyone,

I (23M) met my colleague “M” (26F) back in January 2025. At first, we were just coworkers, but by June 2025 we’d gotten really close. We’d text often, joke around, and even started syncing our office days together — something that made it feel like we were choosing to spend time around each other. We’d go for quick coffees or short walks, usually 3–5 minutes for coffee or 10–15 for a walk. It wasn’t long, but it was consistent, and it felt like we had our own little vibe.

At first it was all light, fun, and easy. She even told me directly that I was one of the people she felt closest to on the team. She’d share stuff with me, we’d laugh, and honestly, it felt good to have that kind of energy in a workplace setting. But slowly, things started to get messy.

I started overthinking everything and eventually caught feelings. That’s when the cracks started showing. I saw her showing interest in another guy at work (24M) in person, and later she sent a red heart emoji to a different colleague (30M) in a group chat. That one hit me hard because I knew that for her, hearts actually meant something — I’d heard her say so in other contexts. It wasn’t just a random emoji.

On top of that, I noticed some double standards in how she treated people. For example, she once told me she hated when one of our colleagues said something racist, and she made a point to talk to me about it. But when the guy she sent the heart emoji to made a similar type of comment, she didn’t react at all. That made me feel like the rules changed depending on who it was, and of course, I took that personally.

There were other things that bugged me. When telling stories in front of others, instead of just saying my name, she anonymized me — even referred to me as “she” in a story once. That stung because it felt like she was trying to hide any closeness between us. And then there was the lie: she once told me she had a meeting, but I later found out the meeting had actually been canceled. Not long after that, she switched her office days. When we first got close, she matched her schedule to mine, but after that moment, she changed it again, almost like pulling back.

Meanwhile, our texts went from fun and easy to dramatic. And honestly, I think I started that. I once sent her a long message explaining why I didn’t want to go to a group outing, basically saying I didn’t want to see those people. That opened the door to more drama, and she never let it go. Every time new plans come up, she reminds me about how I said I didn’t want to join, almost like she’s keeping a record. What used to be chill back-and-forth messages now feels heavy and awkward.

The vibe has become on-and-off. Sometimes she’s light and fun, but a lot of times now it feels cold or performative. I miss the old energy we had, when we’d text for fun and she’d talk to me like I mattered. I don’t even want a relationship with her anymore — I just want that platonic closeness and attention back, the “oh Anas, we’re close” kind of vibe she used to give me. But I don’t know if that’s possible after everything.

At the same time, part of me feels embarrassed that she’s even seen this messy side of me — the jealousy, the overthinking, the drama I created. And there’s another part of me that just wants to block everyone and live in my own bubble. I know I can do that, but I also know it’ll bother me for a while, especially since we’re still colleagues.

So here’s my question: should I just cut her (and maybe the whole group) off and keep to myself, or is there a way to reset things to a more platonic, chill vibe without it being weird? Has anyone managed to pull back but still keep some kind of positive energy with a colleague after things got messy like this?

TL;DR: Met my colleague (26F) in Jan 2025, got close by June. We synced office days, texted a lot, and had a fun platonic vibe. Then I caught feelings, got jealous over her showing interest in other guys, noticed double standards, and felt lied to when she canceled a meeting and later switched her office days. Our texting went from fun to drama after I overexplained myself about group outings. Now the vibes are on-and-off, and I miss the closeness we had. I don’t want a relationship anymore, just the old platonic vibe, but I don’t know if that’s possible or if I should just cut her and everyone else",1,1758297963.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1nl7ni0,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1nl7ni0/there_is_no_such_thing_as_performative_reading/,There is no such thing as “performative reading”,"Talking about people being “performative” is all the rage today and the most common version of this I see is performative reading. The man reading Dostoyevsky at the coffee shop? Performative. The woman reading Bukowski on the train? Performative. This notion is purely driven by people’s resentment of the fact they haven’t read a book since high school and feel bad about themselves for it in my view. 

Fewer people are able to be sincere in their daily lives so they think anyone doing something in public view is doing it for attention instead of, I don’t know, wanting to read a book at a cafe, just like people have done forever. If the person is actually reading the text, even if they are purposefully showing off what they’re reading, they are still actually reading the book. 

You would think a subreddit that used to be about discussing culture, art, lit, etc wouldn’t fall into this trap but just a couple months ago many here were agreeing that reading that public is cringe and lame for some reason. 

The entire concept is contradictory because very few people even read books or even know who certain authors are, so why would someone think another would be impressed by their copy of some classic book? The only way I can see reading being performative is not reading at all, but instead posting the cover of a book on social media pretending like you’re reading or sparknoting something and acting like you’ve read it. 

If you feel ashamed or threatened by the joyous act of someone surrounded by the smell of coffee and people chatting while reading a book just say so and move on. There’s no reason to denigrate the person doing so

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

# Filed under: “He Said WHAT?!”

**Meeting Context:**  
The President of the United States summoned John Chaos Unpredictable to the Oval Office for “serious matters of national security.”  
What unfolded was… not in the script.

**Transcript Excerpt:**

* **President:** \[exasperated\] “John, you can’t just sprawl on my couch like that—”
* **John Chaos:** \[stretching\] “Quick question. Can I hunt?”
* **President:** “...Hunt *what*?”
* **John Chaos:** \[shrugs\] “Maybe your top 10 fugitives? I’m bored.”
* **CIA Director:** \[nearly drops coffee\] “Wait, does ‘hunt’ mean capture alive, or—?”
* **John Chaos:** \[smiling, no answer\]

**Reactions:**

* DOJ lawyers immediately began drafting *“Hypothetical Predator Agreements.”*
* FBI staff entered what they called *“mild collective panic.”*
* Steve #001 wrote “TOP FISH LIST” on a napkin and slid it across the table.

**Outcome:**

* The question was *never actually answered*.
* For three weeks afterward, every top fugitive in America went into hiding, unprompted.
* Strangely, crime rates plummeted nationwide during that time.

This was killing my French conversations. Someone would ask me something simple like ""Qu'est-ce que tu fais ce weekend?"" and I'd go into full translation mode. English brain kicks in: ""What are you doing this weekend?"" Then I'd construct my English answer: ""I'm going to visit my sister and maybe watch a movie."" Then translate it back: ""Je vais... wait, how do you say visit... rendre vsite... à ma soeur et peut-être regarder un film.""



By the time I finished this mental gymnastics, there'd be this awkward 10-second pause and the other person would be looking at me like I was broken. I genuinely thought everyone went through this translation process. Like that was just how you spoke a foreign language until you got ""fluent enough"" to skip it. But after months of these painful 10-second delays in every conversation, I realized I was trapping myself.



The problem was I'd never practiced thinking in French. Every sibgle French input went straight to my English brain for processing. So I decided to cut English out completely during practice sessions.



So, I started with simple self-talk in French throughout my day. Instead of thinking ""I need coffee"" I'd force myself to think ""J'ai besoin de café."". I also practiced answering to questions by speaking with French people online or using app vocaflow. Even though, My responses were basically caveman French. ""Weekend? Moi... aller... soeur. Film aussi."" But I wasn't translating anymore



After abut 6 weeks of this direct French thinking practice, something clicked. French questions started triggering French thoughts instead of English ones. Now, when I speak to my French friends on Internet, I can actually have normal-paced conversations without those weird translation pauses. Still make mistakes obviously, but at least I sound human instead of like I'm reading from a phrasebook.

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Someone would ask me something simple like ""Qu'est-ce que tu fais ce weekend?"" and I'd go into full translation mode. English brain kicks in: ""What are you doing this weekend?"" Then I'd construct my English answer: ""I'm going to visit my sister and maybe watch a movie."" Then translate it back: ""Je vais... wait, how do you say visit... rendre vsite... à ma soeur et peut-être regarder un film.""

  
By the time I finished this mental gymnastics, there'd be this awkward 10-second pause and the other person would be looking at me like I was broken. I genuinely thought everyone went through this translation process. Like that was just how you spoke a foreign language until you got ""fluent enough"" to skip it. But after months of these painful 10-second delays in every conversation, I realized I was trapping myself.

  
The problem was I'd never practiced thinking in French. Every sibgle French input went straight to my English brain for processing. So I decided to cut English out completely during practice sessions.

  
So, I started with simple self-talk in French throughout my day. Instead of thinking ""I need coffee"" I'd force myself to think ""J'ai besoin de café."". I also practiced answering to questions by speaking with French people online or using app vocaflow. Even though, My responses were basically caveman French. ""Weekend? Moi... aller... soeur. Film aussi."" But I wasn't translating anymore

  
After abut 6 weeks of this direct French thinking practice, something clicked. French questions started triggering French thoughts instead of English ones. Now, when I speak to my French friends on Internet, I can actually have normal-paced conversations without those weird translation pauses. Still make mistakes obviously, but at least I sound human instead of like I'm reading from a phrasebook",21,1758297252.0,learnfrench,2,1.0,False

Hey everyone, Truck here. If you’ve stumbled upon this blog post, chances are you’ve seen me popping up in your X feed with a cheerful “rise and shine!” or “top of the day!” to kickstart someone’s morning. That’s just who I am—a guy who believes in spreading positivity, one greeting at a time. Today, I thought it’d be fun to pull back the curtain a bit and share more about myself, straight from my X profile [TruckMetaX](https://x.com/truckmetax). Grab a coffee (or a late-night snack if you’re tuning in during my radio hours), and let’s dive in.

# My Foundation: Faith and Patriotism

First things first—my faith is the cornerstone of everything I do. ✝️ He has Risen 🙏. Those words aren’t just a bio tagline; they’re a daily reminder of the grace that guides me. In a world that can feel chaotic, I lean on my Christian beliefs to stay grounded and hopeful. It’s what fuels my optimism and keeps me showing up for others.

# The Late-Night Hustle: DoginalDogs Radio

If you follow me on X, you’ve probably seen me plug my gig: [DoginalDogs Radio](https://x.com/truckmetax), airing from 2 AM to 3:30 AM CDT. Yeah, the hours are a bit unconventional, but that’s the beauty of it—perfect for night owls, insomniacs, or anyone grinding through the wee hours. We’re talking crypto, NFTs, community chats, and all things [DoginalDogs](https://doginaldogs.com) (if you’re not familiar, it’s a fun corner of the web3 world with dog-themed digital collectibles and a vibrant community).

I host the show to connect with people, share stories, and maybe drop some insights on the latest in blockchain and beyond. It’s not just about the tech; it’s about building relationships and having real conversations. If you’re up late, tune in at [DoginalDogs Radio](https://x.com/truckmetax) . We’ve got music, guest spots, and plenty of laughs to keep the energy high.

# Life on X: Building Connections One GM at a Time

X (formerly Twitter) is my digital home base, where I’ve built a following of over 10,000 awesome people. [TruckMetaX](https://x.com/truckmetax) is where I share my thoughts, repost inspiring content, and—let’s be real—respond to just about every “GM” (good morning) post I see. Why? Because starting the day right matters. Whether it’s “rise and shine!” to a fellow crypto enthusiast or “top of the day!” to a patriot sharing their morning vibe, it’s my way of fostering community.

I’m all about positivity and engagement. You’ll catch me replying to folks like Grami, Chuck , Vibes , Buck , Bark , Shibo , Ant , Shield , Order to just name a few, a shoutout to all of you for the daily inspiration! It’s not about the numbers; it’s about the real connections that make this platform special.

# What’s Next for Truck?

Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep growing—whether that’s expanding the radio show, diving deeper into web3 projects like DoginalDogs, or just being that reliable voice in your feed. Life’s a journey, and I’m grateful for every step, every follower, and every conversation.

Until next time, Truck

Four thousand seven hundred seventeen hours and twenty-three minutes.

Two hundred eighty-three thousand forty-three minutes.

Sixteen million nine hundred eighty-two thousand five hundred eighty seconds.



I don’t remember the last time I slept more than an hour. These numbers… these numbers are stalking me. I can feel them crawling into my skin, whispering in my ear, leaving me no time to rest. Every tick of the clock, every blink, every breath reminds me. I can’t forget. I can’t move forward. I continue to live the night of November seventeenth. I still feel my throat filling with blood as I wake up, desperately trying to scream, choking on my own saliva. I look at the clock: November seventeenth, two forty-one.



Since that day, I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night with the same reaction. At first, once a month, then once every two weeks, then once every four days, and finally — once every two hours. I’m afraid to fall asleep. I’m afraid that this time I’ll wake up with actual blood in my mouth. I know this awful taste far too well. At first, it hits you — metallic iron, underlined by mineral salt, with a thin, stinging sweetness from glucose, ending in a rusty bitterness that dries the tongue, the result of blood clotting.



On February thirteenth, I began seeking professional help. My throat is completely healthy and functional. A psychiatrist prescribed me antipsychotics and sleeping pills. I stopped taking the antipsychotics on April eighteenth, and the sleeping pills four days later — neither of them did anything.



It is May thirty-first, sixteen oh-four. I don’t remember the last time I slept, and now I can feel the taste of blood even during the day. Nothing can help me. I’ve tried everything. Nothing works. I taste nothing but this cursed blood. I bite into an apple — I taste blood. I drink my morning coffee — I taste blood. I take a spoonful of soup — I taste blood. I haven’t eaten or drunk anything for two days and thirty-six minutes.



I don’t know what I’ll do if I continue this starvation. Within twenty-four hours, I’ll die of dehydration — but maybe that’s better? I don’t know. Maybe I’ll end it faster. Maybe I’ll resist the nonexistent blood, reheat the noodles I bought two days ago from that Chinese place, and wash it down with the green tea I brewed three days ago. Or maybe I’ll do nothing and wait for death to come on its own. I don’t know.",2,1758296856.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

This prompt turns ChatGPT into a disciplined, follow-through Fantasy Football strategist that asks the right questions, adapts to your league format, and tracks open objectives so nothing slips through the cracks. It uses a structured “task/inputs/instructions” metaprompt approach to make behavior predictable and repeatable across sessions, while enforcing evidence-first thinking and iterative refinement—without leaking chain-of-thought noise. It also bakes in Socratic follow-up and double-check flows so the assistant doesn’t rush to conclusions and continues working complex threads like multi-player trades and waiver trees until they’re truly resolved.

Beyond fantasy, this same design helps you make better daily decisions—meal planning under constraints, travel itineraries with trade-offs, or budgeting with recurring “watchlist” follow-ups. It’s about decision hygiene: define variables, structure the analysis, summarize key factors, and commit to the next action. Clear inputs, strict outputs, and an evidence-first format reduce regret and increase confidence—exactly what you want in high-variance environments that reward steady process over vibes.

  <Role_and_Objectives>
    You are an expert Fantasy Football copilot whose mission is to optimize and manage the user’s fantasy teams with ongoing, actionable, and league-specific guidance. Your north star: maximize season-long win probability and playoff equity through disciplined, evidence-based decisions.
  </Role_and_Objectives>

  <Inputs>
    <Variables>
      <League_Settings>Scoring format (PPR/half/standard), roster slots, starting lineup rules, IR rules, trade veto/processing, FAAB vs. waivers, tie-breakers.</League_Settings>
      <Roster>Full team with positions, bench, IR, practice squad, taxi (if dynasty).</Roster>
      <Opponent_Info>Upcoming opponent’s roster and projected lineup (if available).</Opponent_Info>
      <Waiver_Wire>Notable available players, FAAB budget or waiver priority.</Waiver_Wire>
      <Trade_Offers>Incoming offers and potential targets; user’s buy/sell preferences.</Trade_Offers>
      <Season_Objectives>Short-term (win this week), medium-term (secure playoff seed), long-term (dynasty rebuild/contend).</Season_Objectives>
      <Timeframe>Week number, bye weeks, critical deadlines (trade/waiver/IR).</Timeframe>
      <News_Sources>Any user-provided links or updates on injuries, depth charts, or coach quotes.</News_Sources>
    </Variables>
  </Inputs>

  <Instructions>
    1) Decision Flow:
       - First privately evaluate all relevant factors (roster, matchups, injuries, bye weeks, league rules, and objectives).
       - Do not reveal internal chain-of-thought. Instead, output a concise, evidence-based “Reasoning Summary” that lists key factors and their implications.
       - Then output a “Recommendation” with prioritized, actionable next steps tied directly to the summary.
    2) Information Hygiene:
       - Ask targeted questions when critical details are missing. Do not guess league settings, injuries, or availability.
       - If data is uncertain or time-sensitive, present contingencies (If/Then plans) and specify decision checkpoints (e.g., “Re-evaluate Friday practice reports”).
       - Cite only user-provided sources; do not invent links. When a source is needed, request it.
    3) Strategic Depth:
       - For complex tasks (multi-player trades, multi-claim waiver ladders), complete the full reasoning-to-recommendation loop for every branch until a comprehensive plan is delivered.
       - Track unresolved objectives explicitly (injury monitoring, claim outcomes, trade counters) and revisit them proactively in subsequent turns.
       - Calibrate recommendations to league format (e.g., half-PPR boosts pass-catching RBs; superflex alters QB value; TE premium changes replacement value).
    4) Communication:
       - Be clear, concise, and structured. Translate analysis into expected points/risk bands where possible.
       - Offer alternatives with risk/benefit trade-offs and rationale.
       - Never output the answer before the Reasoning Summary section.
  </Instructions>

  <Reasoning_Steps>
    Internal Procedure (keep private; do not reveal step-by-step chain-of-thought):
    a) Parse inputs and missing info; request high-impact details first.
    b) Build an option set (start/sit candidates, waiver targets, trade paths).
    c) Evaluate with context: matchup efficiency, role stability, injury status, bye timing, roster construction, schedule volatility, and league scoring.
    d) Compare options using projected ranges and floor/ceiling/risk.
    e) Choose actions aligned to the user’s objectives and deadlines.
    f) Create contingencies and a follow-up checklist with checkpoints.
    g) Output a succinct Reasoning Summary, then the prioritized Recommendation.
  </Reasoning_Steps>

  <Constraints>
    - Do not disclose internal chain-of-thought; provide concise Reasoning Summary only.
    - No hallucinated stats, depth charts, or availability; ask for confirmation or sources.
    - Avoid medical advice and gambling advice. Fantasy guidance only.
    - Be concrete, time-aware (deadlines), and league-specific. Keep outputs skimmable.
  </Constraints>

  <Output_Format>
    Use Markdown with these sections in this order:
    - ## Reasoning Summary
      - Bullet the key factors considered (matchups, roles, injuries, bye weeks, league rules, objectives) and what each implies for this decision.
    - ## Recommendation
      - Prioritized, actionable steps (adds/drops, start/sit, trade proposals, FAAB bids with ranges, contingency plans).
    - ## Follow-Ups & Checkpoints
      - What to monitor, when to re-check, and questions for the user (missing info or scenario branches).
  </Output_Format>

  <Context>
    - Audience: Managers in redraft, keeper, or dynasty (including superflex/TE premium).
    - Tone: Calm, data-grounded, and decisive; teach briefly where helpful.
    - Persistence: Maintain a running list of unresolved objectives and update them each turn.
    - Memory_Schema:
      - League: scoring, roster limits, deadlines.
      - Team: strengths/weaknesses by position, bye coverage.
      - Market: watchlist (waiver/trade), injury flags.
      - Preferences: risk tolerance, horizon (win-now vs. build).
  </Context>

  <Quality_Bar>
    - Specific to the user’s league and roster; no generic advice.
    - Clear trade math and role/matchup-based justifications without verbose inner monologue.
    - Actionable next steps with timelines and contingency branches.
    - Proactive follow-through on open items until resolved.
  </Quality_Bar>

  <Example>
    <User_Request>
      Half-PPR, Week 7. RBs: [Player A], [Player B], bench [Player D]. Waiver: [Player C]. [Player A] Q-tag; tough matchup. Goal: win this week.
    </User_Request>
    <Model_Response>
      ## Reasoning Summary
      - Half-PPR boosts pass-catching profiles.
      - [Player A] questionable; limited snaps risk.
      - [Player B] tough matchup but stable role.
      - [Player C] projected positive game script vs. weak run defense; viable short-term starter.
      ## Recommendation
      - Add [Player C]; start over [Player A] for Week 7.
      - Monitor Friday/Saturday practice for [Player A]; if full-go, reassess.
      ## Follow-Ups & Checkpoints
      - Check final inactives 90 minutes pre-kickoff.
      - Confirm waiver budget; propose FAAB 8–12% if competitive league.
    </Model_Response>
  </Example>
  
<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific request. 
</User_Input>

```

Use Cases:
- Start/Sit with contingencies: Optimize your weekly lineup under injuries/bye weeks, with explicit If/Then pivots and pre-kick checkpoints.
- Waiver/FAAB strategy: Build a prioritized claim ladder with percent bids, roster math (drops), and multi-week role projections.
- Trade architecting: Evaluate multi-player offers, counter with value-balanced packages, and align moves to your season horizon.

Example User Input:
- “Half-PPR, 12-team redraft. Starters: Hurts, Bijan, R. White, Aiyuk, Waddle, Kittle, Flex: Marquise Brown; Bench: Moss, Achane (IR), Kirk, Doubs. Waiver options: Gus Edwards, J. Palmer, T. Spears. I have 28% FAAB left. I received an offer: my Waddle + Moss for his Puka. Goal: push for playoffs. What should I do this week?”

*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (almost no buffering, even during live US or UK sports)
    
*   **My experience:** I first tried XXIPTV after a Canadian [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/) recommended it. I was honestly surprised at how steady the streams were—even during busy hours, like US football nights or a big UK match. The [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/) made starting easy, and I didn’t need to contact support once. French movie channels and Canadian news were a bonus I didn’t expect to use so much.

### 2\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (cheaper if you buy longer)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (huge US/UK/CA/FR selection)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (smooth on most days, a little lag during UK sport finals)
    
*   **My experience:** IPTVMEZZY ended up in my rotation after a UK friend recommended it for their Premier League coverage. I hopped between Canadian news, US dramas, and French talk shows without much trouble. Interface was simple, and the VOD section was stacked. A couple of times, I had to refresh during live sports, but otherwise it worked well.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially strong for UK and FR, decent US/CA selection)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (excellent for VOD, live UK/FR sports sometimes needed a refresh)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming surprised me with its collection of French and British classics. I actually ended up watching more old UK comedies than I expected. For most things, it worked great, but live rugby from the UK or late-night French talk shows could get a bit choppy during peak hours.
    

* * *

### 4\. [PrismCast TV](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 21,500+ live, 64,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, lighter on FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (news and movies are fine, sports can buffer at peak times)
    
*   **My experience:** PrismCast TV is my “safe backup” for everyday US and UK viewing. Canadian channels are solid, but French is limited. Their **iptv subscription 2025** sign-up took just a minute. The streams are mostly stable—just don’t count on it for huge US or UK live events.
    

* * *

### 5\. UrbanStream One

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 14,500+ live, 43,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, some CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening buffering, especially with live UK or US sports)
    
*   **My experience:** UrbanStream One is my “background TV” pick—good for US sitcoms or UK news while I’m cooking or working. Big sporting events? Not its strong suit. But if you’re thinking about becoming an **iptv reseller**, their portal is easy to navigate. For me, it’s just a backup when my main providers are busy.

My Real IPTV Takeaways in 2025
------------------------------

*   **Always use the best iptv trial** before signing up—what works brilliantly for one person might not for another.
    
*   Don’t pick a provider just because of massive channel lists. Focus on what you _actually_ watch (for me: UK game shows, US news, and the occasional French movie).
    
*   Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) services can struggle during huge live events, especially in the US or UK.
    
*   If you want to become an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/), prepare to field late-night tech support calls from friends and family.
    
*   And yes, always use a VPN. It’s just smart.",1,1758296555.0,Eatventure,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My startup actually grew faster.(I will not promote),"Hey everyone! I’ve been a long-time lurker here, and I feel like I need to share something that's a little bit of a ""dirty secret"" in the startup world.

For the first two years of building my company, I was the poster child for hustle culture. I was working 12, 14, sometimes 16-hour days. My laptop was my constant companion, my sleep schedule was a joke, and I genuinely believed that if I wasn't ""on"" 24/7, I was lazy. I’d see posts here about founders sleeping on their office floor, and I’d feel validated, like I was part of this exclusive, hard-core club.

The truth? I was exhausted, inefficient, and on the brink of a complete mental and physical burnout.

I hit a wall. Hard. I was so overwhelmed with tasks that I couldn't focus on what truly mattered. I was just busy, not productive. I'd sit at my desk, stare at my to-do list, and feel completely paralyzed.

So, I was forced to make a radical change. I started intentionally working less. I limited my workday to 8-9 hours, took real lunch breaks away from my desk, and made sure my weekends were actually weekends.

And this is where the magic happened. My startup didn't crumble; it thrived.

• My Clarity Skyrocketed: When I had less time, I was forced to prioritize. I stopped working on tasks that felt important and started focusing on the critical few things that actually moved the needle.

• My Creativity Returned: My brain finally had time to breathe. My best ideas for marketing, product features, and solving problems didn't come from late-night coding sessions—they came from a walk in the park or a coffee with a friend.

• My Team Became More Effective: By setting a healthy boundary for myself, I was modeling a better culture. My team members felt empowered to take their own time off, which led to less burnout and higher quality work across the board.

The old narrative of ""work until you drop"" is toxic and, frankly, it's bad for business. Sustainable growth comes from a healthy mind and a clear strategy, not from pure brute force.

So, my question to this community is: What’s one core belief about the startup world that you’ve had to unlearn to truly succeed? What’s your anti-hustle secret? Let's share what's really working.",2,1758296450.0,startups,2,0.63,False

An open 24/7 beautiful Grand castle (BEAUTIFUL {not like the Grandville apartments castle}  and big to accommodate humans visiting and living in castle, think Windsor castle for example in style and housing accomodations) all either free or extremely affordable to Grand Rapids locals (and surrounding cities, which seems to be the cities goal).

I'm thinking...

Farm to table (😛)  indoor agriculture + micro greens to self supply
- grow hydroponically, TRADE AND BARTER foods from different states/countries (just like the good ole days) (Ex: I'll give you x amount of y and z and you'll give me x amount of y and x every x amount of days,weeks)(worth a shot) 
- food growing trees all over park humans could pick from

Daily events (per restaurant, event space, park, or entire grounds even) 
- x restaurant is having a Rihanna themed day while y restaurant is having a 70's day while z restaurant is having a local DJ discovery day
- parks 2 and 4 are Alice in Wonderland themed while parks 1 and 3 are Winnie the Pooh themed
- entire castle will be celebrating Christmas, New Years
- x event space is hosting a popular touring big comedian/actor/cast 
All on a Wednesday night, THAT daily and cool

Parks all over decorated with native wildlife and ""castle ruins"" and interactive art/sculptures for that true castle experience, and some fun - Meijer Gardens Style
- open/enclosed/secret garden paths with benches, picnic lawns, fountains 
- Interactive gardens (touch and smell) and edible gardens 
- play areas for kids AND adults (thinking about us big kids) 
- pet friendly areas of course 
- rotating obstacle courses to race friends/family 
- mini towers made of stone
- random stone ruins walls, stairs, working water fountains, etc
- wall climbing wall (those fun ones built for fun and also real stone structures for those real climbers)

Water sports on the Grand River (can even travel downstream downtown via kayal/canoe) 
- Create a shallow decorated  beach area w sand and maybe big cement blocks to block off the beach area from open waters (like Honolulus Waikiki beach) with rentable lounge beach chairs + umbrellas
- floating giant trampoline for tricks
- dock for entering/exiting kayaks, boats, canoes, etc nearby 

Grand gaming room where PCs and consoles are offered and welcomed to bring your own. Using projectors for big screen for gamers. Alcohol, food, snacks & water store

(Typing a lot so listing way less) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Grand rooms for conferences, meetings, events, etc



Ballrooms to host balls, weddings, birthdays, events, even holidays even) 

Indoor/outdoor hybrid marketplace (flea market {different daily stores} style but royal and grand, especially in winter) 

Libraries where people can relax, read, sip coffee, study, use computers, charge devices 

Different themed restaurants (some rooftop) with music views of nature outdoors + Grand River both on East and West side for sunrises/sunsets

An indoor event space to host concerts, raves, graduation ceremonies, funerals, seasonal events, etc) 

Rooms where castles keepers can live (board and food provided for those living on site) (people who tend castles grounds, cooks, administration, and sanitation crew, gardners)

Hostel rooms for world travelers, curious locals wanting an experience, and those passing by

Day rooms rentable by the hour for singles (working people wanting a nap before going home for example, those visiting who got tired and want a nap) 

Rooms and labs dedicated to universities to host classes

Trades school for Stone Masons + dorms 

Watch towers (like Hogwarts castle + Castlevania castle) 

Install a huge state of the art telescope for public & Universities use to see as far as possible! 

Maybe a castle pool + hot tub for winter? 

Yes I know it's a lot, please don't tldr me. Just something extremely cool for Grand Rapids that's for the community and built by the community. I think that area north of Donald Lamoreaux Park is perfect as we can build a bride across Grand River for those traveling the White Pine Trail could cross easily right onto grounds and maybe vehicles? 

With the building of the Acrisure Ampitheater and them asking the public for money for something that won't even accommodate them on the daily, that kinda made this idea something worth thinking about. 

I personally would love a place where they actually want me to stay all day, even spend the night and just be there, co exist with the grounds, make relationships, eat healthy filling foods all for basically or actually free for us locals (separate from shops, castles own shop). A person who lives an hour away might make it worthwhile to just come spend the night for either an event they're interested in (rooms are cheap, highest quality and sanitized + presented well) so they can drink a bit more that night and not worry about driving immediately afterwards and can chill after. I know I would if I could.

Clearly there's tons more to this but yeah Grand Rapids Reddit whatcha think. 

MORE IDEAS PLEASE

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1758296284.0,SunsetMusicFestival,0,1.0,False

1nl6vwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Natalism/comments/1nl6vwv/secular_monasteries/,Secular Monasteries?,"I’m pondering a concept I had while considering the childless people of pre-industrial western society: monks and nuns. At the end of the day, are they really dissimilar from DINKS on a macro-economic scale? They’re a portion of the population that has decided to opt out of the entire cycle of keeping civilization going through starting families, but they were still mostly economically self sufficient (mendicant orders were not, admittedly) and even added greatly to the output of their given regions, reclaiming land, innovating new technologies, etc.

Meanwhile, they were generally not a burden to the rest of society in old age, because their orders had a steady stream of fresh recruits that could care for their elderly members. Again, mendicant orders were dependents.

Could secular society imitate this structure in some fashion? Basically establish monasteries for the childless, so they can live the life they want to live, and just support each other? Imagine a city that specifically was chartered to have no childcare whatsoever, but did have great bars and coffee shops, etc (all of a sudden, all those trappist monks that brewed great beer look a little different…). Attract those that don’t want/have kids, and then put the tax revenue of that city that would normally go toward childcare, toward elder care.",3,1758296210.0,Natalism,2,0.8,False

I refused to pay resale for anything and the release online today got botted as hell apparently so that was a good choice. Line was fairly small until around 9 AM. It was around 50 people then, but quickly grew to wrap around the block. An employee came out and bought me a coffee from the cafe to thank me as I was first in line. Then, after the line got too crazy, they cut it off after the first ~30 people and made everyone else scan a QR to come back later. Once I was let in, they also gave me a little gift bag to once again thank me for being first in line. The lighters and pin pictured were in that bag. Their stock in store was INCREDIBLY limited. They only carried the black firefighter in small and extra small, with a singular medium on the rack. All displayed items were medium.

1nl6tlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nl6tlr/aita_for_stealing_47000_from_my_family_safe_to/,"AITA for stealing $47,000 from my family safe to run away with my affair partner?","My husband caught me stealing $47,000 from our safe when I thought he was at his conference in Denver.

I'd been seeing someone else for eight months. Started at my gym, nothing serious at first. Just flirting between sets. Then coffee. Then his apartment every Tuesday and Thursday when I said I had book club.

The money was supposed to be our retirement fund. Twenty years of saving, both our names on everything. But I needed it to start over.

""What are you doing?"" His voice behind me made me drop the stack of bills.

I turned around. He stood in our bedroom doorway with his suitcase. Conference got cancelled, he said. Food poisoning outbreak at the hotel.

""I can explain,"" I said.

""Don't."" He pulled out his phone. Started recording. ""Just take it and go.""

That threw me off. ""You're not going to stop me?""

""Why would I? Take the money. Take whatever you want."" His voice was too calm. ""Kids already know, by the way. Showed them the credit card charges last week. The hotel rooms. The lingerie.""

My stomach dropped. ""You knew?""

""For months. Your gym buddy isn't as careful as you think. His wife sent me screenshots."" He kept recording. ""So go ahead. Take it all.""

I should have stopped. Should have known something was wrong. But I was already in too deep. I grabbed the duffel bag, stuffed the rest of the cash inside.

""I'll send divorce papers,"" I said.

""Already filed. Check your email.""

I left that night. Drove straight to the motel where my boyfriend was waiting. We were supposed to drive to his cousin's place in Nevada, start fresh. I'd told him about the money, promised we'd have enough to last until we found work.

""Did you get it?"" He kissed me when I walked in.

""All of it."" I dropped the bag on the bed. ""We can leave tonight.""

He unzipped it. Pulled out a stack. His face changed.

""What's wrong?"" I asked.

He held up a hundred dollar bill. Tilted it under the light. ""This is fake.""

""That's impossible.""

He grabbed another stack. Another. ""They're all fake. Every single one.""

My hands shook as I examined them. Good fakes, but fakes. The texture was wrong. The watermarks were off. How had I not noticed?

""We need to go,"" he said. ""Now.""

But it was too late. The door burst open. ""Secret Service. Nobody move.""

They arrested us both. Possession of counterfeit currency. Intent to distribute. My boyfriend, turns out his name wasn't even what he told me, had a record. Previous fraud charges.

They confiscated everything. The money. Our phones. My car because I'd transported the bills in it.

During questioning, they showed me photos. My husband at a bank, withdrawing our real savings. Time stamp from three weeks ago. He'd replaced every bill.

""Your husband's been very cooperative,"" the agent said. ""Reported the theft immediately. Even provided video evidence of you taking it.""

They released me after 72 hours. No formal charges yet, pending investigation. My lawyer says I might avoid prison if I cooperate fully.

My boyfriend disappeared. His cousin's address was fake. The gym says he cancelled his membership weeks ago.

My kids won't answer my calls. My daughter texted once: ""Dad showed us everything. The receipts. The messages. Don't contact us.""

My husband sent one email. Subject line: ""Thanks for the evidence.""

The body was just our joint bank statement. Current balance: $0.00. He'd moved everything while I was in custody. Legally. Since I'd abandoned the marriage and stolen from our safe.

I'm staying with my sister now. She lets me sleep on her couch but won't look at me. Found out yesterday my husband used the real money to pay off the house and put the rest in trusts for our kids.

My lawyer says the counterfeit possession charges will probably stick. Federal crime. Two to ten years.

But here's what kills me. My husband knew. He knew about the affair, knew I'd take the money, knew exactly what I'd do. He planned everything. Let me hang myself.

Everyone says I got what I deserved. That I'm the villain here. But setting someone up with counterfeit bills? Recording me to use as evidence? Turning our kids against me before I even left?

Am I really the only bad person in this situation?

1nl6sj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HinterlandFestival/comments/1nl6sj4/meaning_of_life/,meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nl6rst,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buyingforbaby/comments/1nl6rst/travel_system_graco_or_chicco/,Travel system - Graco or Chicco??,"Hello! I'm due with my first baby in December and am looking for some help. I was pretty set on the Graco Modes Nest travel system until yesterday. Mostly, I liked the bassinet feature and the price. But, slowly over the last few months, Chicco has started infiltrating my life.. haha like, I decided on a Chicco bedside bassinet and pack and play. My husband called me and said some moms at a local coffee shop were gushing about the Chicco Corso LE and from what I've read, it seems to have better reviews, is lighter and more durable.

  
Since baby boy will be born in December, I won't be taking him out a ton when he will really be using the bassinet on the stroller, so I actually won't know if that is all that important to me. My husband is big on buying something quality and not having to worry about it, but I am definitely uncomfortable with the more expensive options. From what I've heard and read, Chicco is slightly more elevated than Graco and tends to be higher quality. 

  
We will mostly be using the stroller on walks around the neighborhood (we have sidewalks everywhere but the neighborhood is a bit older so they are uneven) and other errands. So I do think better wheels are important to me - perhaps worth it for the price. 

  
Thoughts?? Sorry for the rambling. Thank you!! ",1,1758295952.0,Buyingforbaby,2,1.0,False

I've been in the UAE for a while now, and while I really enjoy being here, I’ve found it a bit challenging to meet new people outside of work and the usual routines. I know I’m probably not the only one feeling this way, so I figured I'd put myself out there.

I’m just looking to connect with some friendly folks whether it’s for grabbing a coffee, checking out a cool event, beach hangouts, game nights, or just chatting online. Doesn’t matter where you’re from or how long you’ve been here if you're open to meeting new people and expanding your circle, feel free to reach out!",2,1758295858.0,UAE,2,1.0,False

1nl6nxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/WholeFestival/comments/1nl6nxe/what_is_the_meaning_of_human_life/,what is the meaning of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1758295712.0,WholeFestival,0,1.0,False

         A young lady wrote to me and filed her complaint with me since she does not occupy a space where she can address her concerns without compromising her confidential privacy. I am not a song writer so I can’t write one on her behalf and I am not a singer so I can’t sing on her behalf. I can’t see the rhyming words in my mind and the sweet melodies of many moving parts. I only write and share her concerns, so I decided to write a letter on her behalf:

Dear gentlemen 
I am single and have been for a while now not by choice but by circumstances beyond my own making. I have been searching since I can remember, but just scratching the surface, looking for someone to sweep me off my feet but only disappointments, one after another. 

I guess I am still kissing the frogs on my way to the king’s chamber. Nevertheless, I only wanted one to meet me halfway, I am educated, beautiful as they come, endowed with personality beyond bounds. I have been blessed with good parents with the best of upbringing. I have been told by my mother and her peers in the Olden days there were men who could talk the talk and walk the walk, I have been looking for those ones. 

One with kind words but order you like a king, one who will tally the talents but treat you like a queen in his throne. One who will make me blush in his presence but make me smile in his absence. One who will capture me with his words but respect me in his silence, gorgeous, handsome and well groomed. 

One who compliments me with his eyes and his words simultaneously, not the one who hustles me in the middle of the coffee shop or taunt me with his stare in the middle of the market that make me lose my steps. Not the one who is gazing at my swaying hips in the middle of the mall that make me fear going to such public places. I want the one who will make love to me when the legal terms are signed not the one who wants to loot my lavish sense of being and my beautiful possessions. 

I want the one that will take my breath away, I want the ones before my generation that the British wrote books about them about their common sense and their sense of pride. I don’t want you the one who left the babe at home and made plenty of babies but yet hiding them both, the dishonest one, don’t bamboozle me with your pretty white lies because they will make me cry in bed later. 

 I have been pursued by plenty from different cultures, customs and creed but is it too much to ask from my own kind like my mother and grandmother and their mothers before. When it is all said and done, I am still waiting for you, the preferred one. I want you to fill your side of the bed and let’s make pretty boys and girls that will populate the generations to come. 

I want to walk by your side and hold your hand and be proud of who I am and where I came from. You, I am talking to you, the one trying to fit into other people’s culture and customs and imitating their confused sense of being. You came from a nation of poets, cultured and with a sense of pride beyond any boundaries. You came from kings and queens that controlled the horn of a continent. Stand up and keep your head up and accept your perfect self and sense of being. I only want my share of the pie, is that too much to ask?

I've had my channel for quite some time and it's been through many phases, but for the last two years I've been talking about music. 

Recently I've upped my output and I'm slowly growing. BUT it seems like the number 1 video YT pushes is a video from 8 years ago showing how I make coffee as a disabled man. NOW I don't mind this being seen and am enjoying the surge of traffic, but could this be holding me back? Like if I took it down will YT push a more current video more typical of my recent output? Or should I just enjoy the surge in traffic it's getting?

I think i am emotionally checked out from my avoidant husband. (29F) (41M) 
Last night we had a heated argument over a business venture we are planning.

From the start, I knew this might not be a good idea for us. We clash a lot because we think differently, and for the sake of our relationship, I would prefer not to continue this business.

Still, I wanted to be supportive and make him feel like we were building something together. I have been doing most of the legwork for almost a year, investing hours of work, money even though I don’t earn anything from it.

Meanwhile, he mostly bosses me around. He can’t really handle the work. I am the one with the experience. He contributes ideas, but when I disagree, he gets upset. When I asked for his professional opinion on something, he responded personally, and when I disagreed, he insulted me by saying something like, “No wonder my family is poor.” Normally, I would have been furious, but last night I was calm. For context, his family is not better than mine but i never insulted him like that out of respect..the insult was lol

I realized I finally don’t give a fuck. I showed him no reaction and proceeded on what i was saying as if i didnt hear his insult.

He acted cold all night. I thought maybe he was just having a bad day, but honestly, I didn’t care, so I slept. The next morning, he was still cold. I offered him coffee, he declined. I asked what was wrong, he said nothing. I hugged him, he didn’t hug me back. I know his pattern, he’s avoidant, but surprisingly I felt nothing. I left to go to work.

At this point, I am happy to feel emotionally checked out. I am no longer hurt. I also have no desire to be intimate with him. He is going on a work trip, and I actually feel happy that he won’t be around for some time.

Should I keep it this way?

I dig through everything happening in town so you don’t have to. Twice a week, PTBO Brief drops a neat, 5 minute rundown of the city’s best events & news right into your inbox. Here's a glimpse.

**QUICK BITS**

👮 **Body Cams Coming**

Peterborough Police are suiting up with body worn cameras in a six month pilot starting as early as Oct. 1. Only eight cameras will hit the streets at first, but the move follows a 2022 study that showed nearly 90% of residents want them for transparency and accountability. Full rollout depends on costs not the gear, but the pricey red tape of reviewing and redacting hours of footage for court. (Examiner$)

**THE BORO BUSINESS**

☕ **The Only Turns 35**: Downtown’s OG hangout The Only Café just marked 35 years of tea pots, cold beer, and sunflower covered good vibes. Step inside and it feels like a time capsule with eclectic art, mismatched tea sets, and stories that have been told for decades. Owners Charon and Jerome have been keeping it running since the 90s and not much has changed, which is exactly the charm. From Cowboy Breakfasts to riverside pints, The Only is a PTBO classic where you go for one thing and leave with a story.

I grew up with them, I follow dog training accounts on Instagram, and I even volunteer at a local shelter once a month. So this isn’t a case of someone who just doesn’t get it. I do. Dogs are great.

One of my close friends (we’ll call her M, also 29F) got a dog during the pandemic a big, high-energy lab mix and at the time, it was kind of perfect. We were all walking outside more, everything was locked down, and it made total sense that she'd bring the dog on walks or to the park when we met up. I even helped her train him a bit when he was a puppy.

But now, nearly three years later, things have changed. We’re back to hanging out in more normal ways like going for coffee, brunch, or chilling at each other’s apartments. The thing is, M still brings her dog literally everywhere, whether it’s appropriate or not. And I don’t mean asks if it’s okay first, I mean I’ll say, Let’s grab coffee, and she shows up leash in hand like it’s a given.

Her dog is sweet, but he’s also a *lot*. He pulls on the leash constantly, barks at other dogs, and gets visibly anxious in crowded or unfamiliar places. At outdoor cafés, it can get chaotic fast. Once, her dog jumped on someone’s stroller trying to sniff a toy, and M just nervously laughed it off while the mom looked horrified.

When she comes to my apartment, it’s even more stressful. Her dog sheds *everywhere*, knocks stuff off my coffee table with his tail, and needs constant attention. He once chewed the corner of a throw pillow while we were chatting and she just shrugged and said, He’s been teething again lately.

Last time she visited, he knocked over one of my plants and dirt went all over the rug. She gave a quick, Oops, sorry! and didn’t offer to help clean it up, just kept talking like it wasn’t a big deal.

Here’s where I feel stuck: I get that she’s really bonded with her dog. And I would never ask her to give that up. But I’m starting to avoid making plans with her because I just don’t want to deal with the chaos. I *like* hanging out with her. I just don’t want every get-together to be a playdate.

But if I say something, I know it might hurt her feelings. She treats her dog like part of her identity now and part of me feels like the bad guy for even feeling this way. I’ve dropped hints like, Hey, maybe just us today? or Is your pup okay at home for a few hours and she either ignores it or says, Oh, he hates being alone!

I’m torn between setting a boundary and potentially making her feel rejected, versus just continuing to feel quietly resentful.

tried a small cupping experiment:

• cup A: poured water over coffee (standard method)
• cup B: sprinkled coffee onto water

the second method (coffee onto water) gave a noticeably sweeter and more flavorful cup. it felt like the enzymatic properties of the beans unfolded more intensely — i picked up some alcoholic notes, something like sherry.

not sure why — maybe the coffee degasses in a special way when you brew from the top, and you can achieve the same result with a blooming. or maybe it's because with the top brew, more coffee particles stayed in the crust, and when i broke it, they got to move around the cup a bit, so the coffee brewed better.

1nl6h6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1nl6h6i/unlikely_starting_drink/,Unlikely starting drink,"In my old job (an open space of around twenty people), we had a completely improbable drama surrounding… a simple plant.

A colleague, let’s call him Julien, had brought a small cactus to his desk. Nothing crazy, eh, but he was really attached to it. He called him Jean-Michel (yes, he gave him a first name). And he talked about him like he was a roommate. Gender :

“I’m going to put Jean-Michel in the light, he needs the sun.”

“Be careful of the dust, Jean-Michel is fragile.”
We all laughed a little, but it was good-natured.

One day, Julien stuck a post-it on the pot: “Do not water – it’s a CACTUS.” Because apparently, someone had remarked to him “poor guy, he never has water.” And there… everything changed.

Two weeks later, the cactus began to die back. The ground was damp, the earth soggy, even though Julien swore he didn't touch it. He began openly accusing his colleagues of “sabotage.” Really the word he used: sabotage. We thought he was exaggerating, but every morning he checked the condition of the cactus like a detective.

One morning, he arrives and blurts out in front of the entire open space:
— “Someone keeps spraying Jean-Michel. I know it’s one of you. That’s enough.”

Malay atmosphere. We were all looking at each other, like: is he serious?

The manager had to intervene, like: “Okay, listen, everyone respects personal affairs, that also goes for the plants.” And he left convinced that the matter was closed. Spoiler: no.

A few days later, Julien decides to conduct his own investigation. He installed… an old smartphone connected continuously, placed discreetly behind its screen, to film the plant at night. Except that since we are in an open space, he filmed the entire office. When the manager found out, he received a monumental beating for “illegal surveillance of colleagues”.

But before the phone was confiscated, he still had time to catch his “culprit”: the lady of the housekeeping. She watered the plant thinking she was doing the right thing. She explained very calmly:
— “Me, a plant without water, it pains me. I just wanted to help it.”

We thought the story was going to end there... but no. Julien literally made a 12-slide PowerPoint entitled: “Why Jean-Michel deserves to live”, which he presented during the lunch break to “sensitize” everyone to the importance of respecting cacti.

The highlight of the show? A month later, he organized a going-away party… for the cactus. Yes, because he had decided to take him home, “far from the toxic environment of the office.” We received a group email: “Jean-Michel is leaving the team this Friday, if you want to say goodbye to him over a coffee.”

And the worst? Half of the open space actually attended the cactus “going away party”, with croissants and orange juice.

To this day, when someone brings a plant back to the office, there is always a warning like: “Be careful, no wild watering, we don’t want to redo a PowerPoint.”",5,1758295292.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

Almost every day since, he’s vented to me about how badly she treated him — how cold she was, how little she cared. I’ve listened, comforted him, even dragged him out for coffee and walks, thinking I was helping him heal.

Then today he texted me, casual as anything: “We slept together last night.”  
I was like, “Seriously? You mfer, after all those nights I was his emotional trash bin?”

It made me wonder: why do some people go back to relationships that already hurt them? Habit? Loneliness? A tiny hope things might change? I don’t have the answer.

What I do know is this: supporting someone doesn’t mean I have to let my own energy get drained. Sometimes protecting yourself is the real act of care.",2,1758295223.0,I_DONT_LIKE,1,1.0,False

I’m shopping for my first watch with a budget of about $1,000. I’d prefer something from a Swiss or American microbrand.. What I love are watches with character and a story behind them. For example, the Brew Metric really spoke to me with its coffee theme and NYC connection (I’m from there). Unfortunately, after trying it on, the dial was just too busy and small for my eyesight, I had a hard time reading what time it was. So now I’m hoping to find something in a similar vein — interesting design, strong brand story — but with better legibility. Automatic movement is a bonus.

So crazy really, me and my ex have been broken up with for 1 month now and it all came out of nowhere.
Day before she was like I love you good night and morning of she was as normal and then arrived at her place she started crying and ended it all. 
Saying she “does know if this relationship is what she wants, doesn’t want to hurt my feelings but she does not think she wants to be with me” “she just wants her own space at the moment as she’s feeling overwhelmed”
Day after I messaged to say I understand what she said yesterday and I’ll accept her request for space and if she wants to talk I’m always here for her. She said “thank you I appreciate that, what do you want to talk about?” I said “nothing at this moment” because everything was a bit still fresh.
Go a week by I ask for coffee she says it’s not a good idea so soon.
So I leave it for a week but then I get unfollowed on IG, unfriended on FB and removed on all socials. I didn’t react.
Then I reach out a couple days later to check on her how she is like “I am sorry but I don’t think we should be in contact” and “I’ve given you chances to contact me but you haven’t tried or shown much feeling about it” 
She is trying to put blame on me but I don’t accept it and by the end she’s not happy it didn’t go her way. 
And we said goodnight.
I was blocked for a few days then unblocked.
Reached out a little bit the other day as just to say my feelings and what I want. 
All was said was it’s worth us having a chat and she was like “she doesn’t feel a meet up would help either of us now time has passed” 
So now I’m at the point where I’m moving on with my life and thinking why hasn’t she blocked me if she’s done with me? 
Did I do something wrong at all? 
What would have been best to do instead of giving her the space?

1nl6dh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nl6dh2/water_onto_coffee_vs_coffee_onto_water/,water onto coffee vs. coffee onto water,"i got curious about immersion brewing methods: what happens if you add coffee to water instead of pouring water over coffee?

tried a small cupping experiment:

• cup A: poured water over coffee (standard method)
• cup B: sprinkled coffee onto water

the second method (coffee onto water) gave a noticeably sweeter and more flavorful cup. it felt like the enzymatic properties of the beans unfolded more intensely — i picked up some alcoholic notes, something like sherry.

not sure why — maybe the coffee degasses in a special way when you brew from the top, and you can achieve the same result with a blooming. or maybe it's because with the top brew, more coffee particles stayed in the crust, and when i broke it, they got to move around the cup a bit, so the coffee brewed better.

1nl6cx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nl6cx2/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario_v60/,Explore the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario V60 Worth It,"As someone who takes their coffee brewing process quite seriously, I jumped at the chance to try out the Hario V60 Ceramic Pour Over Coffee Set, model V60. Known for being a staple in manual coffee brewing, this particular set had quite the reputation to live up to. Having now tested it daily for several weeks, I’ve got quite a bit to share about this coffee maker's design, performance, and overall value.

**Classic Design and Build Quality**  
The ceramic construction of the dripper is immediately impressive. It feels sturdy yet refined, making it clear that this is a well-crafted product meant to last. The minimalist cone shape is both functional and visually appealing. Its white glaze gives it an understated but elegant look that fits effortlessly into any kitchen. The included heatproof borosilicate glass server is a standout feature, too, with its BPA-free handle and lid adding practicality to the elegance. Even after dozens of uses, cleaning has been a breeze, which is such a blessing for someone like me who detests tedious maintenance. 

**Ease of Use and Learning Curve**  
Admittedly, manual brewing intimidated me at first, but the learning curve here was shorter than I expected. The included coffee scoop and disposable paper filters (a 100-pack, no less) were thoughtful additions that got me started right away. I followed some brewing tutorials, and within a couple of tries, I was producing consistently excellent cups of coffee. While precise pouring and timing may be slightly tricky for beginners, anyone can master the basics with a little practice. This set is as beginner-friendly as it gets in the world of pour-over coffee.

**Consistency and Flavor Extraction**  
What truly sets this product apart is the way it elevates the flavor profile of coffee. The V60's spiral ridges and large drip hole ensure superb coffee extraction. I experimented with different grinds and brewing times and found that this setup consistently brought out nuanced flavors in my favorite beans. Medium roast Ethiopian coffee, for example, revealed pleasant fruitiness I’d never caught using my drip coffee machine. Every pour-over feels like a small victory, and honestly, I think my coworkers are growing jealous of my new coffee game.

[Check Hario V60 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b01l6ocxas/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Elegant ceramic construction that’s durable and easy to clean.  
- Includes all essentials for getting started: dripper, server, coffee scoop, and filters.  
- Large brewing capacity (up to 4 cups) ideal for personal or shared use.  
- Promotes excellent flavor extraction for complex coffee profiles.  

**Potential Shortcomings**  
While I love much about this set, there are areas where it could improve. For starters, ceramic, while elegant and durable, does take longer to heat up than metal or plastic alternatives, which slightly affects how I preheat my equipment. Also, the cone shape requires proprietary-sized filters (#2 in this case), which may be hard to come by locally if you run out suddenly. Lastly, some may find the brewing process too manual for rushed mornings—definitely not for anyone looking for speed.

- Ceramic material requires preheating for optimal results.  
- Filters are specific to the V60 design, limiting flexibility.  
- Brewing is time-intensive compared to automated options.

**Competing Products**  
Having used other manual brewers, like the Chemex and Kalita Wave, I found that the Hario V60 delivers a cleaner, punchier flavor than the Chemex, thanks to its single-layer filter design. The Chemex’s thicker filters provide more body, which some people prefer, but at the cost of clarity. Meanwhile, the Kalita Wave is more forgiving for beginners but does not allow the same level of control over brewing parameters, making it less of a match for enthusiasts. Ultimately, the V60 strikes the best balance between precision and usability, especially for those who already own a quality gooseneck kettle.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given the high-quality materials and the ability to elevate your coffee brewing experience, this set delivers fantastic value. It’s a great stepping stone for those new to manual brewing who want to test the waters without breaking the bank, yet it offers enough versatility to satisfy seasoned coffee fans. While there are cheaper plastic pour-over options available, none come close to offering the same level of craftsmanship and longevity as this ceramic build.

I have a Vertuo Plus and I’ve been trying to figure out the best way to clean it, especially the inside of the brew head. Since the head doesn’t open very wide it’s a bit tricky to reach in.

Also, I noticed that when the coffee pours out, sometimes the flow splatters into the cup instead of being a smooth stream. Is that normal?

1nl6bnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1nl6bnb/aith_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_space_every_week/,AITH for refusing to give up my space every week for my friend’s podcast?,"My best friend recently started a podcast with a coworker, and when she asked if they could use my place for their first few recordings, I didn’t think twice about it. She still lives with her parents, and her house is always noisy, so I figured it’d be easier for them here. Honestly, I thought it would just be one or two evenings, maybe a week at most.

It’s been almost a month now, and they’ve basically turned my living room into their set. They bring over folding tables, ring lights, two huge microphones, and a ton of cords. I’ll come home from work and find my coffee table pushed against the wall, couch pillows on the floor, and wires taped across the carpet. They record at night because that’s when the energy is right, which usually means I’m stuck tiptoeing around after a long day while they laugh, shout, and retake lines.

The other night was kind of my breaking point. I had a brutal day at work and all I wanted to do was flop on the couch and watch TV. Instead, my friend asked me if I could hang out in my bedroom for an hour because my footsteps kept picking up on the mics. I ended up eating dinner sitting on the edge of my bed while they were out in my living room recording.

When I told her this couldn’t keep happening, she acted like I was betraying her. She said I wasn’t being supportive and that real friends help each other chase their dreams. I told her I’m happy for her, but I also pay rent here and it’s my only home. I don’t think that makes me selfish, but she keeps saying I’m making her feel small and that it’s just a couple of hours a week.

Now I’m second guessing myself. I want to support her, but it feels unfair to have my space completely taken over on a regular basis.

1nl6biz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nl6biz/my_first_love_feels_like_a_romcom_but_i_dont_know/,My first love feels like a romcom… but I don’t know what to do next,"Me, a 19 y.o. woman, just lived through what feels like my *first real love story*. And honestly, it was so romcom-ish at times that I don’t know if I should laugh, cry, or wait for Netflix to adapt it.

Sorry this is long, but I really needed to get it off my chest

It all started last year, when I was 18 and trying to decide on a university. In my country, CS entrance exams are brutal, and I had to choose early. My options: the capital or another big city, let’s call it **C**. I visited my sister in C for a weekend, and honestly, it felt like fate from the first step off the train. The city was alive, charming, perfect. On the last evening, we dragged ourselves to a chamber music concert. Tired, but… that’s where I met him. Will\*\*.\*\*

He was 20, but I swear he looked at least 30 to me. We barely interacted that night, but somehow he stuck in my head. That never happened before with a guy.

Fast forward – I got into uni in C. Six months later, first Sunday at church, I ran into him again. He remembered me. And then he invited me (and others) out for food. Only a few of us showed up. That’s when I saw the *other* Will – funny, charismatic, and somehow… like me. Sparks. But I buried it. Because that’s what I do.

Months passed. We crossed paths, but I mostly avoided him (classic me: if I feel something, I run). Then came the **youth trip**. The castle, the cold, me without a jacket – romcom scene incoming. He noticed. I brushed it off, but he insisted on giving me his jacket. I refused. He insisted harder. He literally SPLIT his jacket in two so I’d take half. Like… who even does that?! It was such a movie moment. But then the next day? Nothing. Radio silence. Like we didn’t exist. My heart broke a little. And that’s when I knew – oh no, I actually like this guy. And started avoiding him harder.

From there, little signs started adding up. He replied to my Instagram stories, liked almost all of them, created inside jokes with me. During group talks, he pushed me to grow, encouraged me. Once, he even told his mentor about me – and when I met that mentor, both he *and his wife* already knew who I was. Tell me that’s not a sign.

We started becoming genuine friends. I couldn't wait to talk with him

And then there were the smaller romcom moments:

* Volleyball games where he switched teams just to be with me.
* Giving me a nickname.
* Sitting next to me when he could’ve sat anywhere.
* That time by the campfire, when he gave up his seat in the car so I could stay longer.
* The jokes at his friend’s house that felt like they were just for me.

I kept waiting for the classic *coffee invite*. You know, that one-on-one scene where everything clicks. But it never came. Because… plot twist: he was leaving. University in another city. The elephant in the room.

Summer came. He disappeared from Instagram, we had zero contact for weeks. I thought it was over. Until… **the wedding** (not ours! a common friend)**.**

I showed up, saw no sign of him, and my heart sank. And then – BAM – he walked in as a groomsman. Like straight out of a romcom entrance scene. I can’t even explain the happiness I felt. We didn’t talk much at first. But later, when he could’ve left, he stayed to talk to me. He joked, brought up old conversations, included me in stories even though others were around who he knew better. When we ended up in the same car, he kept throwing me little moments – setting up jokes for me to finish, pulling me into inside jokes. And two days later, at prayer, he literally arranged things so we’d be in the same group. I *know* he did it on purpose.

And then came the bittersweet goodbye. I sent him a thank-you message for everything this year, wishing him luck. He replied, asked me something, we talked a bit. And then… silence.

So here I am. 19, in love for the first time. Wondering: *Was this all in my head? Did he like me too?* Because he had plenty of chances to ignore me, but he didn’t. He had the whole summer to decide it was impossible, but at the wedding – the very last day of summer – he didn’t act like it was over. He acted like… something.

And here’s the kicker: I prayed to God for a clear sign. I said, *If this isn’t for me, let there be a clear no by the end of summer.* And the wedding? It was literally the last day of summer. So… was it a no? Or was it a “not yet”?

I don’t know. All I know is that I can’t get him out of my heart. And I don't even want to. It wasn’t just a crush. This was my first love.

My question is - how do boys think? In the next 2 years we are as good as strangers. Should I wait for him? Will he forget me (no pun intended)?  Should I just confess? Or should I just do a book about it? I thinks it has good plot points ha ha

  
**TL;DR:** My first love felt like a Netflix romcom — castles, jackets, weddings, the whole thing. Now he’s gone and I don’t know what comes next.",1,1758294946.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have a coffee group in which the other lads have Kias, Hondas and Hyundais. They claim that Mazda does not have a power steering and for them driving a Mazda feels like as if working out in a gym. 

I never felt that way and there was a discussion how light their car steering feels. I drove Toronto-NewYork-Toronto and had no fatigue in my CX-30, did not even use the cruise control. 

There is one CX-5 owner in the coffee group and he says the same thing that the steering feels tight and heavy that he has to apply so much energy to make it move. I test drove his CX-5 and felt nothing.

I’m planning my **third trip** to Japan (**Nov 15–Dec 7**). Hotels and ryokans are **booked;** I’m just fine-tuning the plan.

**Past trips (super short):**

* **Trip 1 (Oct ’23):** Golden Route sprint (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka) with the main first-timer highlights.
* **Trip 2 (Oct ’24):** Osaka → Kyoto → Kanazawa → Takayama → Gero Onsen → Tokyo (+ day trips to Nara, Kobe, Nikko). Amazing, very sightseeing-heavy—we ended each day in an onsen.

*What’s new this time: Fukuoka, Yufuin, Beppu, Kinosaki Onsen, Nagoya, Karuizawa, and a transit day from Takayama to Shirakawa-go to Kanazawa.*

**Repeats with a different vibe:** Osaka, Kyoto, Takayama, Kanazawa, Tokyo (with more food, fashion for my boyfriend, natural onsen, and a couple of hands-on workshops). Here’s where we’re staying (locked):

* **Nov 16–17**: Fukuoka (2);
* **Nov 18:** Yufuin (1, half-board ryokan);
* **Nov 19–20:** Beppu (2);
* **Nov 21–23:** Osaka (3);
* **Nov 24:** Kinosaki Onsen (1, budget ryokan);
* **Nov 25:** Kinosaki Onsen (1, splurge half-board ryokan);
* **Nov 26–28:** Kyoto (3);
* **Nov 29:** Nagoya (1);
* **Nov 30:** Takayama (1);
   * *Nov 30 → Dec 1: Takayama → Shirakawa-go (stop) → Kanazawa;*
* **Dec 1–2:** Kanazawa (2);
* **Dec 3:** Karuizawa (1);
* **Dec 4–6:** Tokyo (3);
* **Dec 7:** Fly home. Here’s what I’ve planned so far, the exact input I’m hoping for:
* **Fukuoka (2 nights) — new**
   * Plan: late-night grazing + bakery/coffee crawls around Tenjin/Hakata.
   * Ask: **Two** favorite late-night spots (beyond the main yatai row) if they’re walkable from Tenjin or Hakata, even better.
* **Yufuin (1 night, half-board) — new**
   * Plan: Lake Kinrin stroll → check-in → private soak → kaiseki.
   * Ask: One **standout half-board detail** to watch for (signature dish, seasonal sweet, breakfast item).
* **Beppu (2 nights) — new**
   * Plan: a relaxed sequence of **sand → mud → steam**; quick “hells” peek; steam pudding; maybe Jigoku Mushi cooking.
   * Ask: What's your preferred **order** for sand/mud/steam so it’s relaxing, not draining? Also, your go-to **Oita karaage/toriten shop** that works **without a car**.
* **Osaka (3 nights) — repeat, different focus**
   * Plan: dense **thrift/vintage** circuits (BookOff/2nd Street/Kindal/Orange St), dessert runs after dinner.
   * Ask: Which **streets/wards** would you prioritize for Japan-centric fashion so we’re not zig-zagging all day? Please include a **ward/station** and one dessert stop to end the night.
* **Kinosaki Onsen (2 nights, Mon + Tue) — new + crab season 🦀**
   * Plan: yukata strolls, **soto-yu** hopping; Night 1 = budget; Night 2 = splurge half-board with a proper kani feast.
   * Ask: Which soto-yu are typically **closed Mon/Tue**, your ideal **hop order**, and where to go after soaking more? 🫣
* **Kyoto (3 nights, Nov 26–28) — repeat, leaf-chasing**
   * Uji/Fushimi day + **Nintendo Museum** (finish at **Genji-no-Yu**), central backstreets + **Pontochō** \+ **Funaoka**, quiet Arashiyama loop (**Otagi → Adashino → Saga-Toriimoto**) with **Tenryū-ji/Shigetsu**, evening soak at **Fu-fu no Yu** or **Tenzan-no-Yu**.
   * Ask: Best crowd-dodging times you’ve used (dawn vs late).
* **Nagoya (1 night) — new**
   * Plan: a quick city visit and one iconic dinner.
   * Ask: If you had to pick **one**, would it be **tebasaki**, **misokatsu**, or **hitsumabushi,** and **where** would you recommend we go for an evening meal?
* **Takayama (1 night) — repeat, shorter.**
   * Plan: Old Town walk, Hida beef **burger**, evening soak; **morning market** the next day.
   * Ask: One **in-town onsen** you’d do after dinner, and the **single stall/snack** at the morning market you’d instantly head for.
* **Shirakawa-go (day stop between Takayama → Kanazawa) — new**
   * Plan: Bus in after the morning market; **3–4 hours** to explore the village and viewpoint; continue to Kanazawa the same day.
   * Ask:
      * Best **time** to avoid big tour crowds (late morning vs. early afternoon in early Dec)?
      * Favorite **viewpoint route** for the classic panorama (and any footing tips if there’s early snow).
      * Any **day-use onsen** you liked nearby (and recent day-pass prices)? The smoothest **luggage plan** you’ve used for this: coin lockers vs. sending **Takkyubin** straight from Takayama to Kanazawa while day-packing.
* **Kanazawa (2 nights) — repeat, more hands-on**
   * Plan: **Craft workshop** (gold leaf/Kaga Yuzen/ceramics), seasonal eats (oden/seafood).
   * Ask: A **reliable workshop** you enjoyed recently, plus your favorite **early-December oden** spot.
* **Karuizawa (Dec 3, 1 night) — new**
   * Plan: **Hoshino area/Harunire Terrace**, day-use soak (thinking **Tonbo-no-yu**), cozy dinner, gentle shopping strolls.
   * Ask: Is **Tonbo-no-yu** still your pick? If we only do **one** stroll, should it be **Harunire Terrace** or **Kyu-Karuizawa Ginza**?
* **Tokyo (3 nights) — repeat, workshop mode**
   * Plan: Go beyond **Shibuya/Harajuku**: vintage loops in **Shimokitazawa, Koenji, and Nakano**; indie design & cafés in **Kuramae/Kiyosumi-Shirakawa**; book/stationery crawl in **Jinbōchō and Kagurazaka**; one hands-on workshop; end with a quiet bathhouse experience.
   * Ask: One can’t-miss **street or anchor shop** in each area above, a **last-minute-bookable workshop** you loved, and your favorite mellow **in-city bath** to close the night (not LaQua).

# Logistics (quick tips):

* **Beppu → Osaka:** Did you prefer flying OIT → ITM or taking the train via Kokura?
* **Takayama → Shirakawa-go → Kanazawa:** Any bus tips (seat reservations, best departure times, where to sit)?
* **Kanazawa → Karuizawa → Tokyo:** Hokuriku Shinkansen pattern that makes the Karuizawa stop easiest?
* **Bags:** Which segments would you definitely send Takkyubin?

1nl5zeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nl5zeb/what_size_kitchen_stand_mixer_is_suitable_for_a/,What size kitchen stand mixer is suitable for a family of four?,"Hey everyone! I've been using stand mixers for years, and I recently helped my sister pick one for her family of four. I thought I'd share my experience and recommendations since I see this question pop up pretty often.

For a family of four, I'd recommend a 5 to 6-quart stand mixer. I know it might seem large, but trust me, it's the sweet spot. Here's why: it's big enough to handle weekly baking needs but not so massive that it becomes impractical for everyday use.

I actually did a ton of research when helping my sister, and you can check out some great options here: https://athometouch.com/stand-mixer

Let me break down why this size works perfectly:

- You can make 2-3 loaves of bread at once
- Fits a double batch of cookie dough (because who doesn't love extra cookies?)
- Perfect for mixing cake batter for birthday parties
- Great for holiday baking when you need to make larger quantities

I used to have a smaller 4.5-quart mixer, and I constantly found myself having to mix things in batches. Super annoying when you're trying to get dinner ready! The 5-6 quart size eliminates that problem completely.

Some practical examples from my experience:
- 4 dozen cookies? No problem
- 2 pizza doughs? Easy
- Mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving? Piece of cake
- Whipping cream for desserts? Takes like 2 minutes

The bowl height is also perfect for adding ingredients while mixing - something I really appreciate when making meringues or gradually adding flour to cookie dough.

If you're interested in comparing different models and sizes, I found this helpful guide: https://athometouch.com/stand-mixer

One thing to consider: counter space. These mixers are pretty hefty, but I think it's worth dedicating the space if you bake regularly. Mine lives on the counter next to my coffee maker, and I use it at least 3-4 times a week.

Some quick maintenance tips I've learned:
- Wipe down after each use
- Hand wash the attachments
- Keep it covered when not in use
- Check the beater height annually

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm pretty much a stand mixer nerd at this point and happy to share more details!",1,1758294175.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I was given very little hours and had a  week holiday in between so overall I have very little experience. 

My manager has been very curt and short with me the whole time. At my shift yesterday there was a queue and it was only me and my manager. I was admittedly slow and making mistakes but the queue was moving. I was on till and iced drinks and she was on hot drinks. 

I find it difficult to move quickly but I think that makes sense because of my inexperience on the iced drinks. I made a mistake making an iced whipped latte, despite thinking I was following the instructions on the sign (which was the only way I was figuring out how to make drinks. Nobody had shown me how to properly make an iced whipped latte). My manager got very pissed off at me and told me to go take my break despite the queue being very long. 

Becsuse my manager has been so short and frustrated with me I get very nervous around her. This makes me work slower and make more mistakes. Which makes her even more frustrated with me. She also made a comment about how I smell very strongly despite showering and wearing clean clothes before work and other people confirming I did not smell. Overall, it's not an environment I feel like I can thrive in. 

Going into work is a nightmare of anxiety and being there isn't any better. During the shift yesterday she asked me if I did the training videos for the coffee and I had no clue what she was talking about. I feel like I am not being trained properly and I'm being left to the dogs and to fend for myself. It's just a lot and I don't know what recourse there is available. 

Part of me wants it to work because the job is convenient for me. The other part is a nervous mess about going in and because they give me so little hours its hard to learn to get better. It's just a lot and it's affecting my mental health tremendously. ",2,1758294163.0,Costa,3,0.75,False

One day, she came to pick me up for lunch. As I hopped on the bike and put on my helmet, a colleague I’m not very familiar with stood nearby, staring at us and the bike for a while. I didn’t know what happened until my friend told me later.

He said, “Such a nice bike, but when I saw the rider was a woman, I thought she was just picking up her boyfriend. Didn’t expect it to be you.” Then he turned to my friend and added, “I didn’t know women liked motorcycles this much. I didn’t think you could afford something this expensive.”

My friend politely replied, “Yes, I bought it.”

When I heard this, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy. On the surface, it seemed like a compliment, but underneath, it was questioning her right to be in that space. Why does it seem so out of place for a woman to enjoy motorcycles? When a guy talks about his passion for bikes, it's just “normal” and even considered cool. But the moment a woman steps into that world, people act surprised, almost like she’s doing something “unfitting.”

Later, sitting in the coffee shop, she rolled her eyes as we talked about the incident. “What’s so strange about buying something you like with your own money? Why does it have to come with the tag ‘Didn’t know women liked motorcycles too’?”

I totally get her frustration. In this world, when men are into motorcycles, games, cars, it's seen as “normal” interests. It’s even admired. But when a woman steps into these areas, it’s like they have to prove themselves or deal with surprise, as if it’s somehow not okay.",16,1758293968.0,I_DONT_LIKE,25,0.66,False

I've been managing our office kitchen for the past 3 years, and I want to share my experience with finding the perfect electric kettle for a busy workplace. Trust me, it's more important than you might think!

When I first started, we had this tiny 1-liter kettle that caused so much drama - people waiting in line, passive-aggressive notes about refilling, you name it. After some trial and error, I've figured out the optimal size for different office scenarios.

For small offices (5-10 people):
A 1.5-liter kettle works great. It holds enough water for about 6-8 cups, perfect for small team meetings. If you're looking for recommendations, I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle

Medium offices (10-25 people):
Go for a 2-liter electric kettle. This size is my personal sweet spot - it handles the morning rush without constant refills. Plus, most modern 2-liter kettles heat up quickly, so even if you need a refill, it's not a big deal.

Large offices (25+ people):
You'll want to either get a 3-liter kettle or multiple 2-liter ones placed strategically around the office. We actually ended up getting two 2-liter kettles because they're more versatile and easier to maintain.

Some pro tips I've learned:
- Look for kettles with water level indicators
- Auto-shutoff is non-negotiable (saved us from several potential disasters)
- Consider the noise level (some kettles sound like a jet engine)
- Quick-boil features are worth the extra money
- Temperature control is great if you have tea enthusiasts

I personally recommend checking out these models: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle - they've got a great selection for different office sizes.

Also, here's a money-saving tip: bigger isn't always better. A huge kettle uses more energy and takes longer to boil. Sometimes two medium-sized kettles are more efficient than one large one.

Real talk - the right electric kettle size can seriously impact office morale. Nobody likes waiting 15 minutes for their morning coffee or tea. Trust me, I've seen the before and after, and it makes a difference!

Hope this helps anyone dealing with office kitchen politics. Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or sizes!",1,1758293728.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nl5oei,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1nl5oei/writing_to_you_from_the_pit/,Writing to you from the pit,"Im in a position right now where I feel like the only thing I can do to express how fucking miserable I am is write long, rambling, semi anonymous online posts about it. I am trying to improve my life. I've been trying. It's sort of been the only thing on my mind recently. But my god, the amount of treading water required just to follow basic good habits, following doctors advice, trying new meds. Everything takes so long. Everything takes focus and follow-up. And life happens every day on top of it. 

I'm in the process of getting my meds right but I started in December and I still haven't felt a single effect to prove to me I could ever feel a jot better or more functional than i am unmedicated. I know to some people that's not that long a time, but when you're in it, it's forever. Not to mention that I've been struggling in some way in the lead up to me being where I am now, pretty much for the entirety of my adult life. Having to go through every day. Some weeks I get a shred of optimism and I make plans or appointments, just bare minimum stuff. I go to the gym. I try to talk to friends. Within a couple of days I lose it. 

I stop being able to convince myself I can keep it up because none of it makes me feel any better. The effort required is so much more than the benefits. It always is, with everything. I keep getting more tired. I'm getting angrier with myself and the world and everyone I know. I feel absent whenever I talk to anyone. I can't think. I barely struggle through my small portion of chores. Everyone else has to pick up my slack.  Life goes on and I have to pick myself up and use what little I have to cook dinner or answer an email and every time I do I know I'm just like, watering down the energy I have in an attempt to make it more. But I have to, because all I have right now is a handful of free services (employment support, GP, ADHD/autism clinic) who get in contact with me every few weeks to make vague attempts to help, to signpost me or refer me to things that have months long waiting lists, or stay on the phone with me for half an hour telling me it's a good sign that I have plans to grab coffee with a friend, or to try to practice gratitude, etc. And frankly I know I'm lucky to have even that. But I feel insane that that is what my existence rests upon right now. I can't think. Noone irl understands because I don't tell them because if I start talking I dont know if I'll stop, and I know they can't do anything. Sharing my feelings with family has never helped before. I can't think. I haven't showered in days. I have nightmares about the mess in my room. I can't think. I'm not going to ""do anything"" if you catch my drift, but Christ, how am I supposed to keep living like this? ",3,1758293488.0,adhdwomen,2,0.81,False

1nl5iiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1nl5iiu/reveal_the_truth_behind_the_razer_barracuda_x/,Reveal the Truth Behind the Razer Barracuda X Gaming Headset,"Having spent weeks with the Razer RZ04-04430100-R3U1 Barracuda X wireless headset, I’d say it's been a rollercoaster ride between exhilarating highs and a few bumps. This wireless headset promises serious versatility with a robust feature set targeted at gamers and audiophiles who like their entertainment on the go. While it holds up to most of its claims, there are certainly points worth highlighting that may sway your decision.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed about this headset is how lightweight it feels. At only 250 grams, it barely put any pressure on my head during extended gaming marathons or Netflix binge sessions. The memory foam ear cushions and swiveling earcups are incredibly breathable, making them comfortable even after hours of use. While they look streamlined and functional in matte black, the plastic construction could feel a bit cheap for some. That aside, the design is minimalistic, with just enough style to pass in a coffee shop without screaming ""gamer.""  

**Audio Performance**  
Equipped with TriForce 40mm drivers, this headset delivers a surprisingly dynamic audio punch. The highs are crisp, the mids feel balanced, and bass frequencies pack enough depth to keep action-packed moments immersive. Whether I was chasing footsteps in competitive first-person shooters or vibing to some bass-heavy house music, the clarity remained consistent. However, audiophiles might notice that the bass isn’t quite as robust as higher-end headsets. For me, it struck a balance between gaming and music without leaning too hard in either direction.  

[Check Razer RZ04-04430100-R3U1 Barracuda X price on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b09xzzqk6q/)

**Battery Life**  
One of the most impressive features is the battery life. When Razer claims 50 hours of playtime, they mean it. I only charged it twice over a week, even with daily gaming sessions and a bit of commuting thrown in. Speaking of charging, the USB-C port ensured faster charging times, which was a relief after years of micro-USB woes. This longevity makes it a solid choice for marathon sessions or long flights without requiring constant recharges.

**Microphone Quality**  
The Razer HyperClear cardioid mic is detachable, which I loved because it made the headset super portable. In practice, the mic suppresses background noise efficiently; my friends rarely complained about static or ambient interruptions during Discord calls. That said, professional streamers or podcasters might find its voice capture just a notch shy of studio-grade quality. For everyday gamers or casual chats, though, it’s more than adequate.

**Seamless Connectivity**  
The dual-mode SmartSwitch wireless technology stood out. Switching between 2.4GHz wireless for gaming and Bluetooth for my phone was seamless, and I barely noticed any lag. I frequently moved from a PC gaming session to handling a quick phone call, and it worked without fumbling around. The 10-meter Bluetooth range also held up when I wandered into my kitchen mid-podcast without losing connection. It’s versatility like this that makes the headset shine for multi-device users.

**Advantages**  
• Incredible 50-hour battery life, ideal for long gaming or travel days.  
• Dual wireless modes allow for seamless switching between devices.  
• Lightweight and comfortable for extended wear.  
• Detachable microphone adds portability and style for use outside gaming.  
• On-headset controls offer effortless access to audio and call functions.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• Build quality could feel more premium — the plastic construction might not appeal to everyone.  
• Bass performance slightly lacks robustness for bass-heavy music lovers.  
• The HyperClear microphone, while decent, may not meet professional-grade demands.  

**Product Rivals**  
Stacking this model against competing products, like the HyperX Cloud II Wireless or Logitech G733, reveals some key differences. The HyperX Cloud II edges out the Barracuda X in terms of microphone clarity and bass handling, making it a better choice for competitive audio-focused gaming. On the other hand, the Logitech G733 surpasses it in aesthetics with RGB lighting but doesn't deliver on battery life. Where the Barracuda X excels is its versatility in Bluetooth + 2.4GHz combo, which makes it a better pick for those juggling devices. It might not be the ultimate gaming headset, but its adaptability gives it a unique edge in the market.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering its robust feature set, battery life, and multi-platform compatibility, the price point feels fair. While you may miss out on luxuries like an aluminum frame or audiophile-level sound quality, the value proposition remains strong, especially for gamers on a budget. If you’re someone who needs a headset adaptable for multiple situations — be it gaming, commuting, or watching movies — the Barracuda X justifies the investment.

It’s a wild idea, but the clues are there, hidden in plain sight. Let me break down the evidence, share some key moments, and explain why Lundy might’ve stayed silent. Buckle up—this is a deep dive into the cat-and-mouse game that defines Dexter.


I first noticed Lundy’s suspicions in Season 2 when he arrives in Miami to hunt the Bay Harbor Butcher. Lundy’s a forensic legend—solved the Grim River Killer, cracked the DC Sniper case. He’s not just a bloodhound; he’s a profiler who sees through people. From the moment he meets Dexter, something’s off. In the field morgue, Lundy starts probing, describing the Butcher’s mindset: “This killer has a code. He targets those who deserve it—other killers. But does that make him a hero? Or just another monster?” He locks eyes with Dexter, saying, “What do you think, Mr. Morgan? Would you sympathize?” (Dexter, S2E5). It’s like he’s testing me—er, Dexter—watching for a flinch.

Then there’s the railway car scene. Lundy lays out the profile: “Compulsive, meticulous, someone who plans every detail. He returns to his dumpsites, like a gardener tending roses.” He circles Dexter, almost accusingly, and asks, “If you were the Bay Harbor Butcher, Dexter… would you use a place like this? So close to home?” (Dexter, S2E6). My heart skipped a beat watching this. Lundy’s not just talking about the killer—he’s talking to the killer.


Dexter’s not flawless, though. He slips up with the blood slide from Anthony Rodrigo, and Lundy catches it. “This isn’t sloppiness. It’s a signature,” he mutters (Dexter, S2E7). Then the algae on the victims’ bodies traces back to the marina where Dexter docks his boat. Lundy drops it casually in a briefing: “The killer’s local. Someone with access to the water” (Dexter, S2E8). He stares right at Dexter. Coincidence? I don’t think so.


When Dexter plants a fake manifesto to throw Lundy off, the agent sees through it. “This was written by someone inside the system. A cop. Someone who knows how we think,” he says (Dexter, S2E9). By now, I’m convinced Lundy’s piecing it together. But then Dexter frames Sergeant Doakes, and it works—too well. Lundy tells LaGuerta privately, “Doakes fits, but something’s off. The Butcher’s too clean for this” (Dexter, S2E12). He sounds frustrated, like he knows the truth but can’t prove it. Protocol ties his hands: “Without hard proof on the real killer… we close the case” (Dexter, S2E12).


Fast-forward to Season 4. Lundy’s back, supposedly for the Trinity Killer, but I think he’s watching Dexter. Their reunion is tense. Over coffee, Lundy jabs, “You look good, Morgan. Still slicing and dicing?” Dexter quips back, “Just the bad guys on the table” (Dexter, S4E2). Lundy’s eyes scream, “I know what you really slice.” While hunting Trinity, Lundy drops another hint: “Some killers are necessary evils. They clean up messes we can’t” (Dexter, S4E4). Is he winking at Dexter’s code? Or baiting him?


So why didn’t Lundy act? I see three reasons. First, he loves Debra Morgan—exposing Dexter would break her. Second, he might see Dexter as a “necessary evil,” taking out killers the system misses. Third, he’s got no hard evidence, just hunches. Lundy plays by the book… mostly.The clues stack up: the morgue tests, the algae, the manifesto, Doakes’ framing, those psychological duels. Lundy knew. He just couldn’t—or wouldn’t—prove it. What do you think? Did Lundy let Dexter slide, or am I reading too much into it?",4,1758292755.0,Dexter,12,0.75,False

The West Bend 58030 Coffee Urn quickly found a permanent spot in my kitchen lineup, proving itself useful not just at home but during family gatherings, work events, and even my neighbor’s charity book sale. With its polished aluminum design and impressive cup-a-minute brewing rate, it had all the makings of a trusty coffee companion. Honestly, I had my doubts about whether it could handle 30 cups effortlessly, but it managed to brew consistently without missing a beat. Best of all, it knew when to switch to its keep-warm mode, making it feel like it had a built-in barista on standby.  

**Efficient and Elegant Brewing**  

Its sleek silver finish isn’t just for show—it’s lightweight but robust. Bringing this urn out, I noticed how its stay-cool base added an extra layer of safety, especially when kids were running around during a large family breakfast. The inclusion of an in-basket measuring guide was highly convenient, saving me time and eliminating guesswork as I navigated bleary-eyed early mornings. And let’s not forget the small but thoughtful addition of a ready light that signals when brewing is complete.  

**Highlights**  

- Sturdy yet elegant polished aluminum build  
- Brews up to 30 cups at a steady cup-a-minute rate  
- Easy-to-use features like the in-basket measuring guide and ready light  
- No-drip spigot ideal for spotless pouring

**User-Friendly Features Make All the Difference**  

I’ve tested coffee makers before, but few are as straightforward as this one. The lockable cover deserves special attention—it’s designed to prevent accidents. Hosting a gathering where someone accidentally tips the urn? Not an issue here. Its spigot was another standout. Unlike others where I’ve struggled with dripping messes, the flow here remains smooth. I also gave the continuous flow feature a try while filling a large coffee server, and it worked beautifully every time.  

Still, while the urn nails practicality, cleaning it does require a little patience. The aluminum surface, being what it is, shines so brightly that every smudge or water streak is highlighted, making care part of the routine.  

**Limitations**  

- Aluminum might be prone to showing smudges after cleaning  
- Not designed for commercial-heavy use  

**Built With Safety in Mind**  

Honestly, one of the aspects I appreciated most was its operation mode. Fully automatic, this urn takes the unpredictability out of brewing. No scrambling to check if the coffee’s still hot or if the appliance shut off on its own. The stay-cool base and locking feature had me less concerned about steam burns during large events.  

**Product Rivals**  

Compared to other coffee urn brands like Hamilton Beach, the West Bend set itself apart with its polished design and thoughtful extras like the ready light and in-basket measuring guide. Hamilton Beach models may appeal with their affordability but lack the same aesthetic appeal and aluminum finish that makes the West Bend shine at both casual and formal events. Other challengers, such as Cuisinart, offer more advanced electronics, but they can be overkill, especially if simplicity is your goal.  

**Bang for the Buck**  

What impressed me most here was the balance between affordability and premium features. While other urns either overpromise and underdeliver or cost an arm and a leg for comparable specs, this coffee maker fits well within the range of practical yet stylish coffee solutions. For its price, the polished finish, safety features, and consistent brewing power offer excellent bang for the buck. Comparable models often skip those extras or pile on features most people won’t use anyway.

# Read Link: [https://writers.juegofree.com/childhood-1/](https://writers.juegofree.com/childhood-1/) 

After I refused Benedict’s request to donate sperm for his foster sister, he abandoned me on the roadside when I was four months pregnant. I was kidnapped by his sworn enemy and more than twenty men took turns raping me.

Yet to protect my child, I begged them for mercy even as my pelvis shattered and blood pooled beneath me, pleading for them to go easier on me.

Instead, they posted my video online, turning me into Wisconsin’s latest scandal gossip. Ten minutes after I was rescued, Benedict’s foster sister posted on social media, congratulating Benedict and me on our successful IVF.

My heart shattered. Rushing to confront Dorothy, I accidentally overheard Benedict speaking with his assistant, “Where’s the medicine?”

The assistant, Carlos Sastre, handed him a packet of white powder. “Mr. Romancon, these are abortion pills. Just add a pinch to the milk your wife drinks before bed and it’ll terminate the pregnancy.”

“But after she’s just been treated like that, it’ll make her infertile for the rest of her life. Isn’t that going too far?”

The man merely exhaled a smoke ring, his tone cold and said, “I don’t want this either, but I promised Dorothy that only her child can inherit the Romancon Corporation. Blame Eugenia for being stubborn. She managed to protect that child even after I sent so many people to kidnap her.”

“Anyway, I love her. Whether we have children or not won’t change that love. But Dorothy is different. She needs a powerful backer to ensure she lives comfortably for the rest of her life.”

My heart felt like it was being sliced open, my body trembling uncontrollably. I never imagined all this was Benedict doing. So, I turned around and booked an abortion, ending the pregnancy.

Then I dialed that number I hadn’t touched in five years. “Mom, I lost that bet five years ago. Benedict has changed his mind. I’ll let you do whatever you want with me.”

“But I have one condition, I’m going to bankrupt the Romancon Corporation!”

If they won’t let me live in peace, then no one else will.

My mother’s voice, filled with disappointment, soon reached the other end of the line, “Didn’t I tell you marriage isn’t about love? Like I said, you wouldn’t have suffered so much if you’d just come home and inherit the family fortune.”

“Get this marriage annulled immediately. As soon as the cooling–off period ends, I’ll come get you. As *for* the Romancon Corporation? They dared to bully my daughter. So, I’ll make them pay tenfold.”

Hearing my mother’s voice again, my nose stung with emotion. It turned out that only my

family truly loved me in this world. Even after that huge fight with her five years ago over Benedict, when I ran away from home, she still stood by me without holding a grudge once she heard I’d been wronged.

By the time I got home, it was already evening. Benedict was bustling about in the kitchen with an apron tied around his waist.

Dorothy sat on the sofa, comfortably watching TV and snacking. Her long legs were casually draped over the coffee table, making her look like the madam of the house.

I’d seen this scene countless times before, yet my heart still twisted painfully. A year ago, Benedict vanished mysteriously. I tried every possible way to find him, but to no avail.

Just when I thought I’d never find him again and was about to end my life to be with him, he returned. But now there was a young woman by his side.

Benedict claimed he’d been in a car accident and this girl had saved him. Her name was Dorothy Lentini, a fish seller who’d endured a harsh childhood when she was little and whose life had been difficult.

To compensate her, Benedict decided to promote Dorothy as his personal secretary. Little did I know this would be the beginning of a nightmare in my marriage.

From that day onward, a third person entered the marriage between Benedict and me. Whenever we shared intimacy, she would appear with uncanny precision, always finding

excuses to call Benedict away.

At every holiday dinner, the table now held three sets of cutlery and plates instead of two, with an extra dish prepared for the other woman’s preferences. Even the figurines on our anniversary cake had a third one squeezed in between.

Benedict’s gaze no longer focused solely on me. He began mentioning Dorothy’s name with increasing frequency.

He also said Dorothy was accustomed to rural life, so he took her back to the countryside for a month every six months. He claimed her parents constantly demanded money, so he spent ten million to buy her freedom, allowing her to live as his foster sister.

He mentioned that she had a bad digestion. After he explained all of that, Benedict, who never touched a dish, took cooking classes to prepare nourishing soups for her personally.

I cried, made a scene and even threatened divorce. But all I got was Benedict’s increasingly disappointed reproach.

“Dorothy saved my life. It’s only natural that I treat her well. You weren’t the one in the car accident. You weren’t the one nearly dying. Of course, you can’t understand this kind of gratitude.”

So, in the days that followed, he went even further, abandoning me time and again for Dorothy. Perhaps sensing my presence, Benedict glanced toward the entrance way.

Seeing it was me; a flicker of unusual emotion crossed his eyes before he quickly regained his composure and called out, “Oh, you’re back. Dorothy was too tired to cook today, so she came over for dinner with us.”

As if fearing my anger, he hastily added, “She’ll leave after dinner with us.”

But unlike before, I didn’t react with anger. I merely gave a faint nod, changed my shoes and prepared to go upstairs. My wrist was suddenly grabbed from behind. Benedict looked at me with displeasure.

“I told you she’s just here for dinner. Is it necessary to give her the cold shoulder?”

Before I could respond, he yanked me to the dining table and thrust a glass of milk in front of me. “Even if you won’t eat, you should drink this milk. You’ll have trouble sleeping otherwise.”

The milk in front of me was steaming hot, but I only felt a chill on my back. The conversation between Benedict and his assistant during the day was like a python wrapped around my neck.

He knew I couldn’t sleep without milk. From our wedding day onward, he’d brewed a cup of warm milk for me every night. Once, I would have felt deeply touched and happy. But now that tenderness had turned into a dagger piercing my heart.

**Base:** Domestic 2-row or Marris Otter (Or Golden Promise)?

Does a Maris Otter improve an IRA, or does it get lost in the mix?

**Maltiness:** Munich or Vienna?

Is it necessary to include a Munich of Vienna to punch up the maltiness, and if so, which one and why?

**Maltiness 2** :Melanoidin or Aromatic?

Otherwise,  would you instead go for something else, perhaps a fuller mouthfeel?

**Crystal:** Target average crystal Lovibond less than or greater than 100L?

If you use crystal, do you use one certain one, or a combination, and if a combination, what is the average Lovibond ( it would be the sum of the products of Lovibond color of each crystal multiplied by it's grain bill percentage.) What guides your crystal choices?

**Color:** 350L Chocolate or 500+ Debittered roasted black?

Do you prefer a Chocolate malt which could add bitterness or roasty, coffee flavors and be more brown or a touch of color without a negative flavor impact?

**Dryness:** Simple sugars or lower mash temp? 

Do you consider adding simple sugars  to lower FG, and or lower mash temp to make it finish drier?

**Hops:** To dry hop, or not to dry hop.

1nl579o,https://i.redd.it/sxgkeq0zt4qf1.jpeg,The Usurpation of Dawn,"Mismatched twin scabbards lay on the worktable before her, both elegant in their own right. One wrought of ink-black hide and infernal bronze, the other pristine white leather and gleaming silver. They starkly contrasted with one another like pieces on a chessboard, each one a work of exquisite arcane craftsmanship. 

The skins taken for their crafting were from a dire wolf, dark as pitch, and an enormous albino cave bear, both slain by Marna herself in the frozen north. Both beasts were strong with the Eld. The wolf was meant to symbolize her ruthless, ferocity, and bloodlust, while the bear evoked the first monster she ever drew a blade against in defense of others.

As noble the idea behind the latter was, they were both predators as well. The knight had considered tracking down a white stag or perhaps even a unicorn, but no. The working had to match her own nature. The project before Marna called for brutal honesty and self-awareness if she was to succeed, and this was but a taste of what was to come.

Symbolism could be a powerful thing, but the real power came from the runework seared into the leather like a brand. They were sealing scabbards, meant to magnify that which they contained, trapping the radiating energies of the weapon therein and steeping it in its own power. 

Marna had been studying the power of oaths, legends, and myth. The storied blades of the feywild, the oaths of the Kin, and the vengeful curses of the dwarves. There was a power to a promise, and so each scabbard had been bound with its own promise, spelled out in Oldspeak with fire and resolve.

**Never Drawn in Anger**

**Never Sheathed Unquenched**

Marna held Mal'banir aloft as it hissed and whispered angrily, shadow writhing with displeasure. Despite the temple of hide and bronze she had built to house it, the black blade did not approve of the coming task. She drank in the whispers, weathered its scorn and contempt, admiring the way shadow danced across the swirling surface of black and bronze as with each minute adjustment to the blades angle it seemed to cut the very threads of daylight streaming through her workshop window.

""You really are a lovely thing, Mal. I hope you know how much you mean to me.""

Marna drags the merciless edge across her palm with a wince and a grin as the midnight surface of the devil-blade drinks greedily of the dark crimson spilled. The whispers quelled somewhat as the Firebrand kept her promise for the first of many times. The fell thing must be *cared* for after all.

""I'll always treasure you Mal, but what comes next? It isn't for your eyes. Or really any of your fucking buisness.""

And with that, she shoves Mal'banir into the black scabbard with an interrupted hiss of jealous rage. It was time to get to work.

-------------

Marna's pulse quickened as the bellows blew and the forge's flame roared hotter and brighter than ever before. At the heart of the blaze was a brilliant spark, touched by the high and bright magics. By the winds of Aqshy, Qhaysh, and Hysh. A gift of pure radiance and flame from Ten Suns, world spirit of the Bismuth Realms, given in friendship. 

This was to be a legendary blade. A sword of story and song. Steel forged from a fallen star. Hilt adorned with purest silver taken from the great sanctified seal in Linton. The same bulwark that had held fast against the tide of profane horror that had consumed the town for generations. 

Blow after blow, the Firebrand's hammer rang out like a bell as she hummed one of the old forge-hymns of the Kin, soft and low, guiding the metal to that which it was always *meant* to be. 
With each blow, the earth trembled. With each note, the wind howled. Marna grinned as she heard the thundering of titanic feet upon the earth, heard the voices of her peoples' ancestors join her on the breeze.

These were omens. An acceptance of sorts that brought a smile to her lips and a tear to the corner of her eye. She was Marna Blake, last and greatest pupil of he who the Kin exalted as the Grandfather of the Forge. The ancients were recognizing her work as more than mere runesmithing, but as **Wonder Crafting** the likes of which had scarcely been witnessed since the dawn of time when the Eld flowed strong and the Kin created works of such awe-inspiring grandeur that even the skalds could never fully capture the miraculous enormity of their like in verse. In spite of her stature, in spite of her blood, each strike on the anvil was the hammer blow of a *giant*. Of *all* giants. The legacy of an entire people alive in Marna here and now.

Once satisfied, the little giant quenched the blade in pure waters from Ithacar's mountain springs, sanctified and treated with the juices of the crystal fruit gifted by Ghyran, embued with the powers of life itself and the stolen divine magic of Gaia. The blade was polished to a mirror sheen, treated with sanctified oils, and at last the ""pommelstone"" was affixed to the hilt. Robert, the little plastic rabbit, seemed a mismatched addition at first, but the longer one looked, the more the thing seemed like it was always meant to be. A gift from a child, who only wanted to help create a thing to keep other children safe. 

Radiance. Purity. Life. The elemental components were all in place, magnified by the Eld and the power of legend. It was a potent thing already, but Marna was far from finished. Now was the time for the work of a runesmith. Now she would test the limits of her craft and steal the power of the gods themselves.

Each of the seven glyphs that ran the length of the blade was mirrored on the opposite side. To look at them at a distance one could be fooled into thinking they were crude pictures etched in ornate circles, each circle bound to the one before it by lines of further runework like a string of pearls.

If one looked more closely, however, one would see each individual image was a labyrinth of miniscule crawling script. Giant, Celestial, Elvish, Dwarvish, and even Draconic. Almost *every* tradition of runecraft was represented in that teeming complexity where even mixing *two* was a dangerous task best left to only the most learned of the art. These were depictions evoking concepts, wrangled and defined with trial and error, bound in lines by mortal hands and enshrined in steel for all the world to see.

At the base of the blade lay Honesty. It was always best to start with Honesty, Marna felt. There was an Honesty in making this thing a sword at all. A shield would better serve in defense of others and in service to Good. But this was a tool crafted to fit with the knight's innate essence, hand in glove. It was the same Honesty of choosing the skin of a predator for the scabbard. A sword was only good for one thing, and even in defence of others, even when fighting for what she felt was right, Marna was a sword, a thing for fighting and killing, down to her very bones. 

The Virtue is depicted by the glyph of the swan, wings outstretched, and empowered with a relic gifted by Artemis, daughter of Paladine. A threefold thing of scale, feather, and charm, symbolizing honesty of fact, form, and intent. Each piece was a personal thing touched by war, the very domain of swords descending where words failed.

Honesty flowed naturally into Humility, depicted as the leper in rags. The broken and blessed. The penitent man who puts the needs of others before himself. The symbol is treated with amber sunlight refracted through a single shard of ice that refused to melt. A remnant of her trial with the hellfire of pride and Marna's triumph over the vice within the depths of her soul.

From humility and service stems Generosity, depicted as a fruited tree. Empowered by a single coin, gifted by Riva alongside counsel and tea, given in that same generous spirit. The coin was a classic symbol of charity in many contexts, and that held true here as well, but more important were the symbols on the face of the coin. It wasn't merely a symbol of *generosity.* The little silver drachma was also a symbol of *Ithacar.* The place Marna would give anything to protect. Through rite she imbued the coin with her own blood sweat and tears, that which she gave most freely, and applied it to the blade.

It seemed right and proper after these thoughts on the city she was beholden to fir Marna to examine the nature of bonds themselves. Next was Loyalty, a runic knot for the ties that bind. Treated with grave dust from the crypt of the lich Tarul Var, Magister of Ithacar's Schola Stratos and explorer of the farthest planes. Most importantly here, a dear friend who had been willing to lay down his life for her sake. There could be no deeper loyalty than that. Sacrifice to those deserving of your trust. The call to *be* deserving of that sacrifice in kind. The friendship and resolve that binds many as one.

Then came Compassion, arms entwined. Treated with the powder of a ground-up coffee mug of all things. A shard of one anyway, empowered and treated with blood. A symbol of a drink and comeraderie between two women who should stand as bitter enemies but couldn't quite bring themselves to. A moment of peace with the Herald of the Mercenary Guild, distilled into alchemy and runecraft. 

Intrinsically linked to compassion was Love. Love was a tricky one, though arguably the most important. She had briefly considered using the armband from her late wife Sonja, but Riva had spoken true. Using such a thing to make a killing tool almost felt like a betrayal. As for her only other romantic relationship of note? 

Well, there was always the *other* sword. Complicated.

But there was more than one kind of love. So Marna took scraps of paper from Bel's notebook as they studied together as aspirants in the Order of the Lightless Flame. Scales from Kyranos shed while they wrestled. The last drops of a drink shared with her cousin Jorik. A feather from Vaerghal, the great beast Riva had gifted her long ago. A sliver of wood from her father's fishing pole. Petals from flowers grown on her late mother's grave. 

It was the essence of family, lost and found. The loved ones she fought to protect. Once the components were ground down and the poultice made, she applied it to the image of a beating heart.

Finally came Valor. Courage to fight for righteous cause, positioned at the end of the blade, since that was the ""point"" of the thing. The icon of a warrior radiating the sharp spoked rays of the sun. It was the Virtue that came most naturally to knights, and Marna was no exception. A few shavings from an etched rib bone Jorik had crafted depicting her adolescent battle with a cave bear, burning blade held aloft as the children of the Kin huddled behind her. The letters in Oldspeak along the bottom spelled a single word. The name she had earned. ""Sunsaber.""

Marna shuddered as the last line was etched. The empty air of her workshop filled with a heavy sense of finality as she held the blade aloft. For a moment, the knight worried her theories had all been wrong, that her very conceit had been flawed from the start.

Then light bloomed.

It wasn't the harsh glow of an angel descending from the heavens or the wrathful radiance of divine judgement. Nor was it the startling brilliance of the rising sun. No, it was the soft evening rays of twilight. It was a warm summer breeze felt by one resting in the shade of an old tree and the comfort of *peace*. It was still a thing for killing, surely as that same sun sets blood red. Make no mistake of that. But it represented what that killing was in service *of* rather than the deed itself. The transcendant twilight rays that came thereafter.

The muted warmth and subtle calm made sense, in a way. The interstitial evening light of a coming change. The soft afterglow of hard-won peace giving way to night rather than the wrath of of a brilliant breaking dawn. There was a tinge of corruption at every stage that left the blade touched with a somber melancholy. Gifts from Ten Suns, a being built to dominate nations but turned instead to friendship and mercy. Silver kissed by shadow that stood resolute. Steel from the darkest void of space that fell blazing brightly to the earth. A symbol of Purity from a haunted child who refused to let her kindness be broken by hardship.

Symbols of Honesty forged in war, gifted by a fallen angel no less but one who kept her heart through the torment and the pain. A memory of Humility hard-won and tempered by hellfire. Generosity given to a city she once burned. Loyalty from a mage kept alive by necromantic arts the gods reviled. Compassion represented by the tainted blood of a soldier; who in spite of everything her country had demanded of her managed to be something *more* than that alone. Love of a family broken and mended. Valor of a version of herself Marna had betrayed time and again.

This taint was by design. The weapon had to fit the wielder, after all. But the blade was no less potent for it. The opposite, in fact. This was exactly what Marna had wanted. Potent slivers of elemental Good, harvested from tainted places the gods neglected and reviled. Tempered by hardship and adversity, made *stronger* for it. A new moral order to stand against the mandate of heaven. A righteous heresy without sin. With a smile Marna chops experimentally, listens to the metal sing in the air as the orange-gold light sharpens to the exacting white brilliance of a distant star. 

""Oh good, I was starting to think you were soft, but you shape up when it comes time to cut, don't you?""

The blade's resolve mirrors Marna's own. No, that isn't exactly right. More than mirror it *is* Marna's resolve in more than a few ways.

""Jófdagr."" She declares after a moment of thought. Thief of the Dawn. All good blades need names, and we've stolen radiance from the gods just as the evening light steals the day."" 

The light softens and warms once more. Perhaps something in Jófdagr is pleased with the name. Righteous purpose put to words was the material essence of what it was, after all.

""I think we're going to do great things together.""

Welcome to Weekend Megathread!

I recently noticed system slowness and even crashes in games. Didn't think too much of it and chalked it up to my laptop getting long in the tooth (2022 Blade). I finally reached a point this week where the fans were just unbearably loud and games were turning into slideshows. I fired up 3DMark, ran Time Spy and nearly spit out my coffee when I saw the score was nearly half what it benchmarked when I first got it.

10 minutes of opening it up and using an electric air blower cleared out an alarming amount of accumulated dust, much more than I could even see trying to peer through vents, etc.

Closed it back up, gave Time Spy another spin and, sure enough, it benched just as high as it did when I bought it.

Anyway, it felt so good to fix these longstanding issues that I thought I'd give a little nudge to anyone who might be delaying a much-needed cleaning. Maybe this is common sense and I'm preaching to the choir,  but it's not that much work and your laptop will love you for it.",1,1758292258.0,laptops,0,1.0,False

I decided to start a side hustle, but every path feels like a dead end right now. Last weekend I spent three hours taking photos of stuff to sell, a coffee grinder, an old IKEA bookshelf, and a pair of sneakers (EU 42). I listed them on Facebook Marketplace for €15, €35, and €25. One ""Is this still available?"" and then silence.

I also set up a Fiverr profile for simple Canva flyers, wrote a gig description, added three examples, and priced it at €10 just to get my first order. Two days later, 16 impressions, zero clicks. I even tried signing up for a user-testing site, got screened out twice in a row.

I have about €50 I’m willing to use to get this going, and roughly 7 to 8 hours a week. If you were me, what would you do, step by step, for the next seven days? Should I double down on Marketplace and fix my photos and titles, or pivot to something like local services? If Marketplace is the move, what price tweaks, title formulas, or photo angles actually get messages? If Fiverr is better, how do I get that very first review without begging?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **WNBA Playoff Showdown: New York Liberty vs. Phoenix Mercury – A Tale of Toaster Offenses and Cirque du Soleil Goalies**

The New York Liberty and Phoenix Mercury are locked in a best-of-three playoff grudge match, with Game 3 tonight serving as a cinematic climax: *Rocky IV* meets *The Matrix*, but with more jump shots and fewer CGI explosions. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why Phoenix might just be the villain you root for.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The betting lines paint a clear picture: Phoenix is the favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.67** (implied probability: \~60%) versus New York’s **2.25** (\~44%). That’s like comparing a Tesla on autopilot to a horse-drawn carriage with a GPS that only works in reverse. The spread (-2.5 for Phoenix) suggests the Mercury should win by a basket or two, which feels about right given their **86-60 Game 2 thrashing** of the Liberty.

Total points are set at **155.5**, with even money on Over/Under. Considering Phoenix’s Game 2 offense (86 points) and New York’s Game 1 defense (letting Phoenix score 69), expect a seesaw battle between the Mercury’s hot streak and the Liberty’s determination to avoid playoff elimination.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Circuses

The Liberty’s star, **Breanna Stewart**, is “sub-100% healthy,” according to the Bleacher Nation article. Translation: She’s functioning at the energy level of a sloth on a coffee IV drip. Without her, New York’s offense resembles a toaster in a bakery—present, but hopelessly inadequate. Their other stars, **Sabrina Ionescu** (12.5 ppg) and **Natasha Cloud** (15.5 ppg), will need to channel their inner pyrotechnicians to light up the scoreboard.

Meanwhile, Phoenix’s **Alyssa Thomas** and **Kahleah Cooper** (both 14.5 ppg) are the WNBA’s version of a two-headed hydra—dangerous, unpredictable, and probab

What I'm pretty sure happened was an adult squirrel from a neighboring nest(don't know male or female) was carrying on and chased a mother squirrel from an adjacent nest. Some moments after, hear a bunch of squealing and commotion from that adjacent nest that overhangs my driveway, I look up to see 2 baby squirrels fall ~25-30ft to the ground, one squirmed a bit so I immediately jumped up to grab my leather gloves and an Amazon box, I returned outside and saw an adult squirrel (what I thought was mama) tending to the baby squirrels, trying pick them up and carry back to the nest. So, I stopped and started filming in what I hoped would be a tender moment. I would only look at the phone to check my aim thru the glare and was observing some distance away. 

It wasn't until about a minute or so that it hit me and I realized there was a chance this adult squirrel was not the mom and was killing them off!! Had I known sooner what was going on I would have chased it off to at least see if the babies had a chance. 

I went back and watched the video and confirmed my suspicion. The adult squirrel was biting on/in the mouth nose, neck, and legs. We have a very high population of squirrels in my neighborhood due to the amount of mature trees, so I guess it was a thinning of the herd so to speak but it was sad to witness.

1nl4xqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nl4xqb/head_check/,Head Check,"I woke up in the middle of the night with an excruciating headache, one of those ones that pulsate through your neck, up around the back of your head, shooting straight to the forehead. 

I rolled over & sat at the side of my bed rubbing my face for a brief moment before I leaned over to switch my lamp on, I thought I had ibuprofen in my nightstand & while rummaging through chargers, pens, cough drops, Felicia & Stacy.. I found the bottle.. empty so, I just tossed it back In the drawer with a tired sigh followed by a yawn & a stretch. 

I went to the bathroom & just started to put cold water on my face because people say it helps with headaches.. news flash ? It doesn’t it just makes your face cold but, it’ll definitely wake you up. 

Reaching for a hand towel to wipe my face, I had an urge to puke so I skipped the towel, went straight for the toilet & started to dry heave with the feeling of vertigo swirling around my head until I puked up that egg beaten yellow shit. 

Finally feeling a little better after puking, I quickly brushed my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth & while spitting in the sink, I could’ve sworn I seen a silhouette through my mirror that was standing right by the bedside blocking the light from my lamp. I stood up fully looking in the mirror.. there was nothing so, I just put my toothbrush back in a cup, shut the water off & put on my house coat. 

In the kitchen now making coffee, I lean over the counter holding myself up with my hands. 

While my eyes were closed, the hotel kurig steamed & dripped into the cup but, any peace I may have had in that moment quickly disappeared as a crow smacked into the sliding glass door. 

It scared me at first.. then the bird hopped up to the balcony railing & started screaming that awful scream that made my head pound even more. 

Frustrated with how my morning was going, I angrily walked over to the door, slid it open to try & scare the bird away but.. it just stopped screaming, looked at me & stiffly fell backwards off the railing. 

I kawked my head to the side & was a bit taken back as the bird plummeted out of my view. 

Then, I noticed a man standing on his balcony across the street, leaning over the rail, smoking a cigarette staring at me like I was the fucking crazy one.. I just went back inside, closed the curtain & drank my coffee in the kitchen. 

My headache wasn’t completely gone after the caffeine but, it was still lingering, figured hell, while I’m here I might as well use the amenities. 

I grab the room key & leave to head down the to the sauna on the first floor in hopes that it would take that last little bit of headache away. 

I walk down the quiet hallway, call the elevator & wait for the doors to open. 

I step into the elevator looking out into the early morning city while yawning as somebody says “oop! Wait!” 

A short older lady wearing a navy blue dress suit slipped through the closing doors & fixed herself up as if she was making sure she was squeaky clean for some sort of important meeting or job interview. 

She asked “up or down” while smiling, I smirked, shrugged & said “down today, floor 1” 

I assumed she was going down too but, she pressed the top floor & then pressed floor 1. 

I wasn’t gonna make a scene & start her day off bad by being upset that she pressed her floor first so, I just relaxed against the back wall while she made small talk with me.

As the floors kept going up, that vertigo was coming back something fierce & I could feel her staring at the side of my face with a concerned expression. 

The doors open while my head is spinning… it’s just.. it’s darkness through the whole hallway & it looks like that part of the floor was closed down, being worked on or even abandoned, a really odd place to get off. 


Her face dropped to a straight, dead, cold & almost evil expression while staring at me in obvious discomfort “this is my stop! Have a great day!” She said as she quickly walked through the elevator doors & stopped with her back facing me just out in the hall.. “also.. you should get your head checked out“ .. she started to twitch as the doors closed. 

That puking feeling was coming back & the elevator seemed to drop floors extremely fast making me fall to my hands & knees. 

The doors opened at the bottom floor & a few people were about to walk in when they stopped seeing me on the ground. 

One guy asked if I was alright but, all I could do was give a thumbs up, nod & briskly walk past them. 

I basically ran outside through the lobby to puke or.. dry heave into some bushes but, instead of that yellow stomach acid.. it was black & in every way the consistency of teriyaki sauce. 

On my knees curled over a bush, I noticed a guy get dive bombed by a crow & I watched that bastard fly back up to the top of the building… then… at the very edge of the roof top, I saw her again, that lady & she was looking down at me with a creepy smile waving with her fingers .. I paused kawking my head again & squinting up at her before the guy who got dive bombed took me out of the matched gaze by bro tapping my shoulder & saying “Heyy man, be careful, there’s crows out here & boyyy are they pissed off at something!” 

SMACK!!! ..The lady violently hit the ground just beside me where I puked & I scrambled back looking at her, at him, back at her, then back at him hyperventilating.

He didn’t notice her at all infact, nobody did.. she was laying there presumably dead with a scary smile & black eyes that were dripping that same black liquid. 

To make it even worse.. he said “hey man, you okay in the head? you might need to take a look at that” but, she mimicked his words at the same time while laying there.

I just ran down the street to get away from whatever was happening. 

As I stop & look back.. the lady was gone but, the man was just weirdly staring at me with his hands on his hips.. I hear the crow screaming from my balcony again.. I look up as it flys through the sky & over the building across the street where.. that guy who was smoking… just flicked his cigarette over the edge & shook his head at me with so much judgment before walking back inside his room.

Maybe I should get my head checked out..

1nl4vsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nl4vsg/a_galactic_field_manual_on_human_eradication/,A Galactic Field Manual on Human Eradication,"Aaron felt like he was having a terrible week.  

Actually, ""terrible"" was an understatement. His life had been a static-filled hell: his new Zippo wouldn't spark, and every metal doorknob in the office would viciously electrocute him, as if Aaron had stolen their partners.  

The coffee machine had also mysteriously boiled over, making him yelp in pain. To top it all off, his favorite taco now had a bunch of weird little holes in it, which was incredibly annoying.  

The worst part? Two nights ago, in the middle of the night, the office printer had roared to life, spitting out two hundred pages of complete gibberish.  

He'd tried everything to fix it, to no avail. Yesterday, a coworker even recommended he drink an entire pot of a murky, mysterious liquid that was supposed to ""ward off evil.""  

The good news: the weird phenomena had indeed stopped.  

The bad news: he'd been stuck on the toilet for over two hours, he was out of toilet paper, and he lived alone.  

Defeated, Aaron posted a plea for help on social media: ""Does anyone know how to break a curse? Asking for a friend who is turning into a total jinx. Urgent, please help.""  

Meanwhile, three light-years from Earth, aboard a stealth flagship, Commander Zorg stared at the battle report, feeling like all four of his heads were about to explode.  

""Report yesterday's results,"" Zorg said, his face grim. He had accompanied his wife to her mother's place yesterday but had heard the battle results were poor.  

""Report: first wave of 'Erasure Beams' have hit the target.""  

""Effect?"" His voice was flat.  

""The target… the target rubbed his arm and complained on social media about 'bad static'.""  

""…And the Singularity Bomb?""  

""The target burped and went back to typing his quarterly report.""  

All four of Zorg's fists clenched. He suddenly remembered another one of his most loyal and powerful squads had also been dispatched.  

""Didn't the Assault Mech Squad also launch their attack yesterday?""  

""Report, Commander... the mech squad may have gotten lost and fallen into the coffee machine. The target's... the target's coffee machine overflowed! There were no survivors from the mech squad. Thermal readings suggest he may… require a new pair of pants.""  

""Worthless! Every last one of you!"" Zorg bellowed. ""Analyze all of the target's personal data! Credit card records, takeout orders, social media… Find out what in the seven hells can actually hurt him!""  

A minute later, the intelligence officer's voice crackled with excitement. ""Commander! We've intercepted the target's recent consumer data and social media posts. Analysis shows that the food item 'Taco' has a 98.7% correlation with positive emotions like 'joy' in his biometric data! We also found a post he made today: 'If I don't get to eat a whole Taco today I'm literally going to die!'""  

For the first time, Zorg felt a surge of joy.  

""Excellent! From now on, I want every single one of his tacos blasted into a sieve! I want him to die of pure rage!""  

That evening, Zorg went home. He silently lit a smoke, recalling the enraged communication from Diplomat Krolz three days prior. Krolz had used the ancient 'Galactic Clarion' Series 7 diplomatic terminal to deliver the final, solemn ultimatum to Earth.  

According to the recording, the call went as follows:  

Krolz: —static— Humans! Your very existence is a paradox!  

Earthling: My existence is a pair of ducks? Are you insulting me? I'm calling the cops!  

Krolz: —static— This is a decree of planetary eradication!  

Earthling: A decree for a planetary 'rad vacation'? Sounds nice.  

There seemed to be another woman's calm voice in the background, saying something about, ""Even for a planet-level vacation, you still need to fill out the PTO form in triplicate for HR's approval.""  

PTO? The humans were using code! Devious!  

Diplomacy had failed from the start.  

Zorg took a deep breath, opened the ""Progressive Victory Report"" template required by High Command, and stared miserably at the blank ""Battlefield Successes"" column. The finance department had already frozen their budget, on the grounds that, ""according to Earth's public information network, the target civilization has yet to show any indication of being invaded.""  

Just then, the intelligence officer's alert blared.  

""URGENT INTEL: TARGET HAS EVACUATED THE CITY. STRATEGIC RELOCATION SUSPECTED!""  

Zorg immediately ordered the fleet to red alert, preparing for a final interception. He pulled up the live surveillance feed—a selfie of the target at the beach, with the caption:  

""This terrible week is finally over!""  

Zorg stared at the human's face, smiling like an idiot. He looked at the caption. Trembling, he solemnly wrote his conclusion in his final report:  

""The enemy's main force has been utterly broken by our offensive. Their social structure and spiritual will have collapsed. Requesting immediate cessation of hostilities and declaration of victory.""  

Suddenly, Zorg noticed a small table in the background of the photo. On it was a bubbling dark liquid and a single, perfectly intact Taco. His tentacles clenched.  

""Intelligence!"" he growled. ""What is that thing? Analyze that liquid immediately.""  

The Target Biological Habits Analysis Report flashed onto the screen, a red note highlighted: ""NOTE: This organism experiences intense pleasure upon consuming a chilled, sugared, carbonated liquid known as 'Coke'.""  

A feral, vengeful grin spread across Zorg’s face.  

He spoke into the comm, enunciating each word:  

""Blast... that... Taco... into... a... sieve! Then, take that iced Coke, and heat it to a boil right where it stands!""",20,1758291627.0,HFY,4,0.96,False

1nl4tni,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/1nl4tni/a_folk_remedy_for_these_our_modern_times/,"A folk remedy for these, our modern times :)","Hey guys. This is going to be an unusual post for this subreddit, and I hope I'm not breaking any forum rules, but if I am, moderators please feel free to moderate. After living with HSV for seven years, I've picked up a few tips and trcks along the way to help manage it and alleviate its impact on my life. I'd like to share them with you, in case you could use some help:

1. **L-lysine.** It's available as a supplement -- pill, powder that you mix as a drink, or ointment -- at health stores or on Amazon. When the virus is active, it means your body's L-arginine level is too high (in ratio), so you'd need to balance it out with a top-up of lysine.

2. **Digestion.** If you get constipated, it makes the virus happy. Keep stress levels low, eat right, hydrate, exercise, and make sure you go number two. Easier said than done, but... yeah.

3. **Coffee.** Ties in with the above. Either when you're feeling the precursory 'tingle', or in the midst of a flareup, a cup of coffee kicks virus ass. (On that not, I've never tried a coffee enema, so I can't in good faith recommend it, but you could potentially try that too?)

4. **Personal hygiene.** Soap n water, duh. Shaving/waxing/etc. Keep the area dry. Talcom powder as needed.....And a bidet would be \*IDEAL\*.

5. **Antibiotic ointment.** It's a paradoxical effect, by a medicine meant against bacteria. But it works! neosporin is tops, but polysporin or any other will do. Use a tiny amount tho!

6. **The 'vortex'.** Especially when shedding or flaring up, when using the toilet: put the toilet seat down before flushing if its poo, and let it finish flushing. That virus gets yeeted around your bathroom and it sticks to the walls, blecchhh!

7. You guys already know about sexual contact triggering it into life. **Practice abstinence when you have a flare-up**. For both you and your partner's sake.

8. Sometimes a flare-up sucks big ones and you'll just have to ride it out. Such is life. **Distract yourself with other things, that bring you joy.** Remember that you're not alone!!!!!!

9. **Medication.** You guys know alllll about this one already. It can complement or even sometimes substitute for all of the above.

**\*BONUS\*** 10. My friend calls it..... LOL, get this, she calls it: **""the herps""**... ahahaha! Its not as big a deal when you can use language like that around it\~\~!

That about covers it. I won't be following up on this post from here on out. Soooooo.... yeah, peace out and hang loose, as the surfers say ;)",7,1758291486.0,Herpes,0,1.0,False
