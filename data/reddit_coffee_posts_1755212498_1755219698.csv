1mqizvm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mqizvm,Trying a repost on 2024-P Kennedy halves with photos,"From two $1,000 surveys of Kennedy halves, I've found the following:

$1,000 2024-P full box

percentage with some die anomaly 43

percentage with ""coffee bean"" above the part in Kennedy's hair 18

There are a couple of associated chips associated with the coffee bean: there is a small chip below the part (similar to the one below) and a small die chip or anomaly at the corner of Kennedy's mouth that sometimes looks very like a beauty mark.

percentage with die chip in Kennedy's hair below the part 25

The die chip below the part comes in at least two variations, one with a somewhat greater or lesser chip (it varies) at the corner of Kennedy's mouth and one with a secondary chip in the hair toward the rear of Kennedy's head. The percentages for those are running 18 and 7 percent, respectively.

From the second survey of $1,000, I found the following:

percentage of 2024-P coins (this was a mixed box), 48 percent; percent with some variation: 27 percent of the total $1,000 in the box

percentage with coffee bean (out of the full $1k): 9 percent

percentage with one variation of the below-part chip or its variants: 18 percent (so a slightly higher percentage of the 2024 coins themselves had the die anomalies present); the percentages of the variations of this chip were 12 and 6 percent.

I hope all these numbers aren't too confusing, but the second box had a difference in the populations of the die anomalies above and below the hair part. Comparing the percent of variations of first box to the second, the first box had more of the coffee bean compared to its representation in the second box. The chip below the part and its allied anomalies were more common in the second box, compared to the number of coffee beans found.

So far as visibility goes, the coffee bean is just visible in good light; the other die chips and such are also just visible in really strong light but not easily seen by me without a 5x or 10x loupe.¬†

Interestingly, I have not found all these die anomalies together as a group on any coin. Typically, they have been of either the coffee bean and its associates or the chip below the part and its variants. I have found some with just the coffee bean, others with only the chip below the part; more frequently, those two primary anomalies are present with one or more of the others.

\*The photos show the coffee bean, and two of the below-part chip with some associated anomalies. Two pix in indirect light are not as sharp as I wanted. The pic in extremely bright light has everything illuminated, to a fault. I've marked the pix with blue to help pinpoint the die anomalies I've seen.",1,1755219461.0,CRH,0,1.0,False

Anyway, popping in to say how much I enjoy this sub, and all the witty (and exasperated) people who post here--you guys are the bestü•∞. I also want to say that I hope we can continue to opine, from time to time, about our favorite trainwreck of a reboot. And I'd like to throw forth a few predictions, given how up-in-the-air everything is. Will there be loose ends left untied? (Probably.) Will there be totally baffling and illogical things said and done? (Mais oui!) Will there be PIE? God, I hope so.

Anyway, here's what I think will happen tonight:

Carrie will make plans to go to London. I don't see how she can resist a man--a writer, at that--whose arms look like that. (Duncan clearly has an American personal trainer, because in my experience, that kind of toned physique is not as common in England as it is in the States.) Plus, he likes her BRAIN. And as far as we know, he has no children--at least not any children who'll bash her in the head and terrify her with their tantrums.

Miranda will reach out to Joy, who apparently told her she wouldn't be coming to Thanksgiving, and appeal to her; Joy will indeed show up, if only for coffee and dessert (and possibly gin). They will talk about the family fracas, and agree to take things slowly.

Mia will be there, and she'll privately tell Brady that the baby not only isn't a Libra (as would be obvious at that point), but he or she is not Brady's after all. They will go there separate ways, a whole pie in hand as they leave.

Charlotte and Harry will arrive with some of Charlotte's cooking (brisket, maybe?), and both teens in tow. There will be far too much food. Lily will roll her eyes a lot and Rock will be basking in accolades for their stage performance.

Seema and Adam will be playing footsie under the table, and Seema will suggest they take a long weekend vacation in the Caribbean this winter, when Adam's workload will be super-light.

LTW and her man will stop by for coffee and pie, and LTW's outfit will contain elements of orange, rust, and brown.

1mqiw9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mqiw9d/aitah_seriously_am_i/,AITAH? seriously am I?," Okay, where do I start?

My fiance & I [both early 20's] have been together for 4 years, we have a very close relationship, but we have had our fair share of issues and obstacles to overcome during our time together.

One of these obstacles has been traveling together.

Everytime we've traveled together, theres been instances where her insecurity shines, and she accuses me of micro-cheating, or wishing i could cheat with other women in the places we travel to.

Recently my parents who im pretty estranged from told me they wanted me to come on a trip overseas with them. Normal person should be excited right? 

Well... this made my stomach turn for many reasons.

My girl & I just recently took an out of state trip together, which resulted in absolute chaos.

We went to get coffee together, & as anyone would, I thanked the barista after she gave us our drinks.

She then tells me that I must want to fuck her and cheat on her with the barista, & proceeds to say this for hours.

We usually argue when this happens, because she is always right, & I am not allowed to deny anything even if it is absolutely ridiculous.

& I am a very fair man. I don't call her every worry and complaint ridiculous.

During the trip, I chose to not feed into any of the comments she threw my way. Because I truly wanted this trip to be the one that changed my outlook on us traveling together.

This did nothing. It only got worse as the day went on, & she only continued to get more angry and say meaner things.

I dont belittle my woman, I dont yell at my woman, I continue to just try to have a good time with her, while she is clearly not present at all.

We get back to our hotel room and all hell breaks loose, she starts yelling at me and causing a scene easily loud enough for any neighbors to hear.

In the midst of this episode, she calls her parents, and tells them they need to come get her immediately... 

[its already 5pm & its a 12 hour drive back home]

Her parents then crazy enough start driving in our direction to pick her up.

I would never act violently toward my girl, & with the way she was acting & hysterically freaking out, I felt like if others heard they would've definitely assumed she was distressed.

So, I grabbed my keys, and told her I was going to leave until her parents arrived & she was able to be picked up safely & calm down.

While I was gone, she calls me crying hysterically, begging for me to forgive her for the nasty things she said to me, and to come back to the hotel.

She also made her parents turn around after driving toward us for almost 4 hours...

This story^ is the reason I am terrified to bring my girlfriend on an overseas trip with my parents who I already have a rocky relationship with.

I decided to tell her I think its best if I go alone, and she actually ended our engagement and relationship of 4 years over me suggesting that I take the trip with my parents by myself.

I have nothing to lie about here. Especially because she will never see this or know its me sharing this information, but honestly I love my girl more than anything, or anyone.

I dont look at other women, & I have never cheated on her, nor would I ever.

Her reasons for insecurity come from relationships before me, and her finding old things in my phone that I didnt think about deleting before we got together.

I have no friends that are women, I have no colleagues that are women, and I have no time to cheat on her. Not that I want to to begin with!

I work from home and were together literally all day everyday. 

I am not a porn addict, I am not a sex addict, Im a pretty normal guy.

So, am I the asshole for not wanting to bring her on this trip?

-Bounced around tier-2's and 3's before landing in Qingdao in 2017

-Moved to Shanghai in 2019

COVID

-Wound up in Japan for 2020-2023 (Tokyo then Yokohama)

-2023 moved back to China and am in a T1 in the West

Originally I was very much a ""dang China has problems"" kinda guy. The infrastructure was always mildly not working, the construction was haphazard and worrying, the air quality ranged from city to city but winters were a nightmare, the locals were that annoying kind of curious, and (this is gonna be controversial) I kinda ""bought"" the Western idea of ""us vs. them"" and zero sum game and the Bajillion deaths of Communism.

Cut to post-COVID and I take everything back.

I had 3 years out of China and it really feels like in that time they ""fixed"" everything. OR maybe it's that phenomenon where you see a friend lose 1 pound a day vs. not seeing him for a year and they're down 80 pounds. You see the big changes as shocks.

The ""internet of things"" is here and it is basically done, it's built. It works phenomenally. The QR payments, digital banking, online services, delivery, shopping, connecting for events, it is so seamless. I can't imagine living without it.

By contract in Japan I get paper bills for EVERYTHING and I have to walk to 7-11 and pay them all in cash. Blech.

The air quality is night and day. We returned to China in February, still winter, and the air quality was far from perfect but it was 1/10th what it was pre-COVID and the Summer is Everything Sunny All the Time Always.

The honking is almost completely gone. Right now I'm drinking a coffee on my balcony and have heard 1 horn since started writing this.

The access to foreign products has quadrupled. In Shanghai foreign markets were a thing but now they're EVERYWHERE! We went to visit friends in Haikou (which I find to be a crummy city) and they had tons of foreign markets with cheese and meats and pastas that would've been overpriced taobao buys pre-COVID even in Qingdao.

The pay is still amazing. I always see people lamenting that a bowl of noodles went from 10 RMB to 14 RMB but a 30,000+ salary is still AMAZING and if you can't save 20,000 a month you're not even trying.

There are some downsides: The training centers are gone and so far the private work market seems to be completely gone. I'm sure some people have a few private clients still but it used to be a bananza. There's also way less ""fun"" foreigners, the 21 year old fresh out of college first job ever party animals are pretty much completely gone.

However it definitely seems like the colleges have way more foreign students from Azerbaijan, Morocco, Thailand, Vietnam, etc. so it's a new beast.

I get way less stares these days, honestly almost none, everything feels so much calmer.

Any time China is mentioned on this sub there seems to be brigades that go around downvoting anything positive and parroting expat frustrations from 10 years ago about banking or racism.

China is a nice life. I have 0 plans on leaving anytime soon.

I know there's a whole economy beneath the laowai-eye, I am very good friends with one of my coworkers (her and my wife hang out a lot) and we have dinner at least once a week and we discuss politics and economics and such, I know China is in a transition, but so is everywhere. Youth unemployment is up worldwide, housing prices are up worldwide, etc. but I do think China is handling is better than most other countries and I still believe in the long-term vision of China.

On top of that the safety (as in pickpockets, theft, fraud, violent) is comparable only to Japan. I would even rank China as safer than South Korea when I was there in 2019 (I was told many times not to leave my belongings on tables however they were open it was the foreigners to be worried about, not the Koreans).

The VPN stinks I guess but it really doesn't affect my life. I have a V2Ray account, it's on almost 24/7, and it might give me hiccups twice a day. In Japan the ($50 a month) internet speeds completely died at 815 PM. Like we would just give up on streaming a movie it was so bad.

Any one who may read this and thinks about China, if you see a lot of anti-China comments ask them when was their experience. Yesterday I was speaking to a Singaporean business owner and she was talking about the ""Kpop Phenomena"" skewing a lot of foreign perceptions of China, I think she may have a point.

Let‚Äôs get this straight right off the bat ‚Äî if you own Bitcoin, congratulations! You‚Äôre officially part of an elite club of forward-thinking digital asset holders. üéâ But here‚Äôs a rule every Bitcoin veteran learns sooner or later: **never, ever tell anyone exactly how much Bitcoin you hold.**

Why? Because the moment you do, you‚Äôre painting a giant neon sign over your head that says, *‚ÄúHey world, please treat me like a walking crypto ATM!‚Äù*

Sure, in the early days of Bitcoin, you might‚Äôve been tempted to brag ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 5 BTC!‚Äù ‚Äî and your friends would reply, ‚ÄúCool‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs a BTC?‚Äù But now? People know. And people get‚Ä¶ *curious.*

Some will be harmlessly curious. Others will suddenly become your best friend. And a few might think of ‚Äúcreative‚Äù ways to part you from your sats. From social engineering scams to phishing attempts to plain old awkward conversations with relatives, revealing your stack size can open a whole can of digital worms.

Think of it like your bank balance: you wouldn‚Äôt walk around telling strangers how much money is in your checking account. Bitcoin works the same way ‚Äî except it‚Äôs borderless, permissionless, and transferable in minutes. That makes it even more important to keep your holdings private.

# Keep It Mysterious, Keep It Safe üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Instead of saying, ‚ÄúI have 2.5 BTC,‚Äù say something like:

* ‚ÄúI dabble in Bitcoin.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stacking sats.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI know a guy who knows a guy.‚Äù

Be vague, be mysterious, and you‚Äôll protect yourself from unwanted attention.

# But‚Ä¶ You Still Need to Accept Bitcoin Payments üí°

Here‚Äôs where the challenge comes in: while keeping your holdings a secret, you might still want to receive Bitcoin ‚Äî maybe for your business, side hustle, or just splitting a dinner bill with friends.

You could type out your long, clunky Bitcoin address every time‚Ä¶ or you could make things super easy (and stylish) with our **free Bitcoin QR Code Maker**.

At [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), you can instantly create a scannable QR code for your Bitcoin address. Just share the QR code when you want to receive payment ‚Äî no need to expose your wallet balance, private keys, or any sensitive info.

It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs free, and it makes you look like the cool crypto pro you are. Whether you‚Äôre accepting Bitcoin for a coffee, a piece of art, or a consulting gig, a QR code keeps things simple and secure.

# Final Word: Shhh‚Ä¶ ü§´

Owning Bitcoin is exciting ‚Äî but part of being a responsible Bitcoiner is keeping your holdings to yourself. Think of it as digital OPSEC (operational security). You can be loud about Bitcoin adoption, privacy, and decentralization‚Ä¶ but quiet about your own stack size.

So next time someone asks, ‚ÄúHow much Bitcoin do you have?‚Äù ‚Äî just smile, shrug, and maybe hand them a QR code instead.

More of a fable than a plot with twists & turns, this story still does its job very well. As the story unfolds, we become more & more aware of the fact that this is a tale about one main character, and the rest is a backdrop. The episode doesn‚Äôt attempt to weave a bunch of things together, but it doesn‚Äôt need to. This is a fable that hits hard, and knows how to stay in its lane.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Atmosphere:

Even as a kid, though this wasn‚Äôt one of my favorite episodes of the TZ, it was always one of the best atmospheric stories in my eyes. I love the scenes on the deck, swirling in fog & terror & confusion. The dessert and coffee scene, really the only section where we have a large group setting, has a wonderfully cozy ‚Äúcharacters trapped in a cabin‚Äù type of feel to it. That is always one of my favorite ways to build character development and tension (as we‚Äôll get to in ‚ÄúWill the real Martian please stand up‚Äù).

And the doomed passengers, facing death by drowning, burning, or being blown up, give a terrific glimpse into the horror of being hunted on the high seas. 

Score: 6/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

4Ô∏è‚É£ Creepiness:

There‚Äôs nothing creepy here in the way of a murderous doll, a giant stalking a cabin in the woods, or an evil dummy with a taste for revenge. But the way it captures a foggy night, being watched and hunted by unseen metallic monsters, and our protagonist unaware of what is unfolding even though he‚Äôs slowly understanding great peril is on its way - all of that is gorgeously spooky in a very different style than some other creepy TZ installments. 

Score: 3/10

5Ô∏è‚É£ Lesson:

At first blush, I came into this review ready to say that the lesson here is pretty simple and on the nose - don‚Äôt be a war criminal! However, that would of course be very small-minded of me. The decisions we make, the way we treat fellow humans, all of those choices ripple far beyond the moments in which we make them. And some choices, for all eternity.

6Ô∏è‚É£ World-Building:

I don‚Äôt think this category is a strength of the episode, nor is it a huge weakness. Obviously there is a real world backdrop to which this episode is set, World War II. Beyond that, the world-building is pretty darn limited. 

Score: 3/10

7Ô∏è‚É£ Acting:

I think the acting is fine. I actually enjoy the performances by all the secondary characters on the boat, more than the portrayal of Lanser. And the lieutenant in the final scene, yikes - if you can‚Äôt do an accent, just stop trying üòÇ 

Score: 4/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

8Ô∏è‚É£ The Human Condition:

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I don‚Äôt come away from this episode feeling any strong connection with the human condition, or that this episode gives us an introspective look into what it means to walk this earth as a human. That‚Äôs ok! It‚Äôs a fine episode for what it is. 

Score: 2/10

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚úÖ Total Score:
 41 of a possible 80

This is a classic mid-tier episode for me. Never going to be one of the first ones I‚Äôll look forward to watching, but also not an episode that I dread revisiting from time to time. I love the sets, I love the high stakes at work, and Serling‚Äòs narration is as good here, as it ever gets.

If you‚Äôre an American looking at Vietnam for retirement, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the romance ‚Äî coffee on a balcony in Hoi An, motorbikes weaving through Hanoi‚Äôs streets, and the slow pace of life compared to back home.



But before you sell the house and book that one-way ticket, you need to understand the ‚Äúboring‚Äù side of retiring here ‚Äî taxes, healthcare, and how your U.S. retirement income plays with Vietnam‚Äôs rules. Ignore this stuff and you could turn your dream into an expensive headache.



1. U.S. Taxes Follow You Everywhere



No matter where you retire, the U.S. taxes citizens on worldwide income. Even if you haven‚Äôt set foot in America for years, you still have to file a tax return every year. That‚Äôs the non-negotiable reality of a U.S. passport.



What changes is whether Vietnam taxes you, too. Vietnam‚Äôs tax system depends on your residency status:



Tax resident: If you‚Äôre in Vietnam for 183+ days in a year, or have a permanent residence there, you‚Äôre taxed on worldwide income. Rates are relatively low compared to U.S. brackets, but it still means your pension, investments, and other income could be taxed twice unless you plan properly.



Non-resident: If you spend less than 183 days and don‚Äôt meet residency criteria, Vietnam only taxes income earned in Vietnam. Your U.S. pension, Social Security, or IRA withdrawals aren‚Äôt touched locally.



For many retirees, staying ‚Äúnon-resident‚Äù for Vietnamese tax purposes is the sweet spot ‚Äî you still file to the IRS, but Vietnam won‚Äôt take a bite out of your U.S. income.



2. How to Keep the IRS From Double-Dipping



Even if you owe nothing, you still file. That‚Äôs step one. Step two is using the tools in the tax code to avoid paying twice:



Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE): Lets you exclude a certain amount of earned income from U.S. tax. Good if you still work part-time abroad, but pensions don‚Äôt count as ‚Äúearned income.‚Äù



Foreign Tax Credit (FTC): Lets you subtract taxes paid to Vietnam from your U.S. tax bill. For retirees, this is usually the more relevant tool.



If you‚Äôve been abroad and not filing, there‚Äôs a process called ‚ÄúStreamlined Filing‚Äù that lets you catch up without heavy penalties if your non-compliance wasn‚Äôt deliberate.



You‚Äôll also need to know about FBAR (for foreign bank accounts over $10K) and FATCA reporting if you hold significant overseas assets. These aren‚Äôt taxes, but failing to file them can get expensive.



3. Healthcare: Public vs. Private



Medicare doesn‚Äôt cover you outside the U.S., so if you retire in Vietnam, you‚Äôll need your own plan.



Vietnam has a public health system that covers most locals at low cost. The government even provides full coverage for children, the very poor, and elderly citizens over 80. The public system works, but facilities can be basic, and English-speaking staff aren‚Äôt guaranteed.



That‚Äôs why most expats and retirees use Vietnam‚Äôs private hospitals and clinics. These facilities, especially in big cities, offer modern care, shorter wait times, and staff who can communicate in English. They aren‚Äôt expensive by U.S. standards, but costs add up without insurance.



The smart move? Get an international health insurance policy that covers both routine and emergency care, including medical evacuation if you ever need treatment elsewhere.



4. Retirement Income & Pensions



From the U.S. side, your Social Security benefits still get paid to you in Vietnam. There‚Äôs no interruption just because you live abroad.



What‚Äôs missing is a ‚Äútotalization agreement‚Äù between the U.S. and Vietnam. That means you can‚Äôt combine work credits from the two countries to qualify for benefits. Any Social Security eligibility comes purely from your U.S. work history.



Vietnam‚Äôs pension system exists, but it‚Äôs built for people who have worked there long-term and contributed to the social insurance fund. Unless you‚Äôve been employed in Vietnam for years, it won‚Äôt apply to you. For most Americans, retirement income will come from Social Security, private pensions, 401(k)s, IRAs, or investment accounts ‚Äî all based in the U.S.



5. Visas & Residency Can Affect Taxes



Your visa situation isn‚Äôt just an immigration issue ‚Äî it can influence your tax obligations. If you‚Äôre on a long-term visa or residency permit and spend most of the year in Vietnam, it‚Äôs easier for the government to classify you as a tax resident.



If your goal is to avoid Vietnamese taxes on your U.S. income, you‚Äôll want to structure your stays accordingly. That might mean spending part of the year outside Vietnam to keep your ‚Äúnon-resident‚Äù status for tax purposes.



6. The Practical Checklist



File your U.S. taxes every year ‚Äî no exceptions.



Use the Foreign Tax Credit to avoid double taxation.



Decide if you want to be a Vietnamese tax resident or not ‚Äî and plan your time there accordingly.



Budget for private healthcare or buy international insurance.



Know that your Social Security still comes in, but Vietnam‚Äôs pension system won‚Äôt apply unless you‚Äôve worked there.



Keep an eye on visa rules ‚Äî they can change.



Final Word



Retiring in Vietnam can be an incredible choice. The pace of life is slower, the people are warm, and the culture is endlessly fascinating. But the dream only works if you‚Äôve handled the paperwork, planned your healthcare, and understood how both countries view your income.



Do that, and your retirement years can be full of new experiences ‚Äî not tax surprises or medical nightmares.",1,1755218543.0,globalinvestorelite,0,1.0,False

If you‚Äôre an American thinking of spending your golden years in Vietnam, I get it ‚Äî the country has a unique mix of energy, beauty, and history. But beyond the beaches and bowls of pho, there are some serious ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù topics you need to have handled: taxes, healthcare, and how your retirement income will work overseas.



Let‚Äôs skip the travel brochure stuff and get into the nuts and bolts.



1. Taxes: Vietnam vs. the IRS ‚Äî Two masters, one paycheck



The big wake-up call for many retirees abroad is this: the United States taxes its citizens no matter where they live. Yes, even if you haven‚Äôt set foot in the country for years, you‚Äôre still expected to file a return every year. Uncle Sam doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind.‚Äù



Vietnam, on the other hand, taxes based on residency. If you‚Äôre in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a year (or meet other residency criteria), you‚Äôre considered a resident and taxed on your worldwide income ‚Äî but the rates are relatively low compared to the U.S. If you‚Äôre a non-resident, Vietnam only taxes income earned within Vietnam, and your U.S. pension or retirement savings generally won‚Äôt be touched locally.



That‚Äôs a huge difference. Most retirees end up structuring their stay so they don‚Äôt trigger Vietnamese residency status for tax purposes. Even if you do, Vietnam‚Äôs rates are modest, and there are ways to offset U.S. taxes with credits.



2. Filing obligations for Americans abroad



Even if you owe nothing, the IRS still expects you to file your Form 1040 every year. In addition, if you hold foreign bank accounts with balances over certain thresholds, you may also have to file an FBAR and possibly FATCA-related forms.



The good news? There are tools in the U.S. tax system that can help:



Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) lets you exclude a set amount of earned income from U.S. taxation if you meet residency or physical presence tests. (This applies to earned income, not pensions.)



Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) lets you offset U.S. tax liability with taxes you‚Äôve paid to Vietnam or elsewhere.



For retirees, the Foreign Tax Credit is often the more relevant tool, especially if your income comes from U.S. sources.



If you haven‚Äôt been filing and need to catch up, there are programs like the Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures that can help you get back in the IRS‚Äôs good graces with reduced penalties, provided you can show your non-compliance wasn‚Äôt intentional.



3. Healthcare: Plan it before you need it



One of the most overlooked parts of moving abroad is healthcare. In Vietnam, there‚Äôs a public healthcare system that covers a large portion of the population, and for locals, it‚Äôs relatively inexpensive. The government provides full coverage for certain groups, like the very poor, children under six, and the elderly over 80.



However, for expats and retirees used to Western healthcare standards, public hospitals may feel limited in terms of facilities, technology, and English-speaking staff. That‚Äôs why many foreigners use Vietnam‚Äôs growing network of private hospitals and clinics, especially in major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. These facilities often have modern equipment, well-trained doctors, and staff who speak English ‚Äî but you‚Äôll pay more for it.



The smartest route for Americans is to secure a good international health insurance policy that covers both routine care and emergencies. This ensures you can access the best local options or even get evacuated to another country if necessary. Medicare won‚Äôt cover you abroad, so you‚Äôll be on your own unless you‚Äôve planned ahead.



4. Retirement income and pensions



From the U.S. side, your Social Security benefits will still be paid to you while living in Vietnam ‚Äî there‚Äôs no rule stopping that. However, Vietnam doesn‚Äôt have a totalization agreement with the U.S., which means you can‚Äôt combine work credits from both countries to qualify for benefits. If you‚Äôve paid into the Vietnamese social insurance system, those benefits are entirely separate.



Vietnam‚Äôs own pension system is based on contributions from employees and employers over many years, and most foreign retirees won‚Äôt be part of it unless they‚Äôve worked in Vietnam long-term. So for most Americans, your retirement income will come from U.S. sources ‚Äî Social Security, pensions, IRAs, or 401(k)s ‚Äî and the main planning concern will be how to get those funds into Vietnam efficiently without triggering extra taxes.



5. Residency and visas



While this isn‚Äôt strictly about money, your visa status can have a huge impact on your tax situation. Long-term visas or residency permits may make you more likely to be considered a tax resident in Vietnam. On the flip side, keeping your stays under 183 days a year can help you avoid that.



The rules can change, and Vietnam sometimes tweaks its visa categories, so it‚Äôs wise to stay updated and, if possible, consult with a local immigration lawyer or relocation service.



6. Putting it all together



Here‚Äôs the practical summary:



\--U.S. taxes don‚Äôt go away ‚Äî file every year and use credits or exclusions to avoid double taxation.



\--Vietnam‚Äôs tax bite can be small if you plan your residency status carefully.



\--Healthcare is solid if you go private ‚Äî budget for insurance, and don‚Äôt count on Medicare.



\--Your retirement income stays yours ‚Äî no Vietnamese tax on U.S. pensions if you‚Äôre a non-resident, and Social Security still gets paid out.



Plan your stays and paperwork so you don‚Äôt stumble into unwanted residency status.



If you handle the paperwork, Vietnam can be a fantastic place to retire. You can have a rich, vibrant life with access to decent healthcare and a manageable tax situation ‚Äî but only if you approach it strategically.



Retirement isn‚Äôt just about where you want to live. It‚Äôs about making sure the systems that support you ‚Äî your income, your healthcare, and your legal status ‚Äî are all working in your favor. Do that, and you can enjoy your coffee by the lake in Hanoi or the sunset in Da Nang without worrying about letters from the IRS or unexpected hospital bills.",1,1755218356.0,globalinvestorlife,0,1.0,False

¬† AT PRECISELY ZERO HOURS UT, or midnight Universal Time, the image of the tortured man erupted onto the world‚Äôs most popular Web site.  
  
¬† The first six words he spoke would be remembered forever by everyone who heard them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am dead. I was murdered.‚Äù  
  
¬† He was speaking Russian on the screen but at the bottom his tragic story was retold in virtually any language one desired with the press of a key. Secret Russian Federation police had beaten ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù of treason out of him and his family. He‚Äôd managed to escape and make this crude video.  
  
¬† Whoever held the camera had either been scared to death, drunk, or both, for the grainy film vibrated and shook every few seconds.  
  
¬† The man said if the video had been released that meant he‚Äôd been recaptured by government thugs and was already dead.  
  
¬† His crime? Simply wanting freedom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere are tens of thousands just like me,‚Äù he told the world. ‚ÄúTheir bones lie heavy on the frozen tundra of Siberia and in the deep waters of Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan. You will see evidence of this soon. There are others who will take up the fight now that I am gone.‚Äù  
  
¬† He warned that while the world had focused on the Osama bin Ladens of the world for so long, the old evil, with a destructive force a million times greater than the combined Islamic renegades, was clearly back, and deadlier than ever.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt is time the world knew the whole truth,‚Äù he shouted at the camera, then broke down in tears.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy name is Konstantin. My name was Konstantin,‚Äù he corrected. ‚ÄúIt is too late for me and my family. We are all dead now. My wife, my three children, all gone. Do not forget me, and why I died. Do not let my family perish in vain.‚Äù  
  
¬† As the man‚Äôs image and voice faded from view, a mushroom cloud lit up the screen, and superimposed on the bottom of this horrifying visual was the ominous tagline: First the Russian people, then the rest of the world. Can we afford to wait?  
  
¬† The production values were rudimentary, the special effects amateurish, but no one cared about that. Konstantin and his poor family had made the ultimate sacrifice so that the rest of the world would have a chance to live.  
  
¬† The first person to see the video, a computer programmer in Houston, was stunned. He e-mailed the file to a list of twenty friends on his share list. The next person to view it seconds later lived in France and suffered from insomnia. In tears, she sent it to fifty friends. The third viewer was from South Africa and was so incensed at what he‚Äôd seen that he phoned the BBC and then did an e-mail blast to eight hundred of his ‚Äúclosest‚Äù mates on the Web. A teenage girl in Norway watched the video in horror and then forwarded it to every person she knew. The next thousand people to view it lived in nineteen different countries and shared it with thirty friends each, and they with dozens each. What had started as a digital raindrop in the Internet ocean quickly exploded into a pixel-and-byte tsunami the size of a continent.  
  
¬† Like a spreading pandemic, the video ignited a maelstrom worldwide. From blog to blog, chat room to chat room, e-mail to e-mail, the story passed. With each retelling it grew in proportion until the globe was in apparent jeopardy of being overrun at any moment by crazy, bloodthirsty Russians. Within three days after Konstantin‚Äôs sad proclamation, the world rang with his name. Soon half the earth‚Äôs population, including many who had no idea who the U.S. president or the pope was, knew all about the dead Russian.  
  
¬† And from the e-mail, blog, and chat room circuits the story was picked up by newspapers on the outskirts of the mainstream. And then the likes of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and leading dailies around the world were sucked into the frenzy, if for no other reason than it was what everyone was talking about. From there, it hit the global TV circuit, with everyone from Channel One in Germany to the BBC to ABC News and CNN to government-run TV in China heralding a possible new doomsday era. And from there it became firmly planted in the world‚Äôs collective mind, soul, and conscience, becoming the number one story to such an extent that there were no other stories anyone cared about.  
  
¬† The rallying cry of ‚ÄúRemember Konstantin‚Äù was heard on the lips of people on all seven continents.  
  
¬† The Russian government issued emphatic denials to all of it. Russian president Gorshkov even went on international television to denounce it as a complete and total lie and offered up what he called ‚Äúslam dunk‚Äù evidence that no such person as Konstantin had ever even existed. Yet not many people believed him. Gorshkov was ex-KGB. From top to bottom, the Russian government was filled with fascist demons; journalists across the world had been informing people of that for years. It was just that up to this moment no one had really cared, because, well, it hadn‚Äôt interfered with their lives. Now they had dead Konstantin and a mushroom cloud on the Internet telling them that it suddenly mattered very much.  
  
¬† There were certainly plenty of skeptical people out there who held serious doubts as to who and exactly what Konstantin and his video were actually supposed to represent. These same people would start to investigate the supposedly dead man and his story. Yet for many others they had heard and seen all they needed to unequivocally make up their minds.  
  
¬† But Russia and the rest of the world would never discover that Konstantin was actually a fledgling actor from Latvia, his ‚Äúwounds,‚Äù and ‚Äúemaciation‚Äù the result of clever makeup and professional lighting. After shooting his piece he‚Äôd washed up, removed all elements of his disguise, and had a nice lunch at, of all places, the Russian Tea Room on 57th Street in New York, spending part of the $50,000 he‚Äôd been paid to do the shoot. Since he also spoke Spanish and possessed dark good looks and a chiseled body, his chief ambition now was to win a major role in a Latino soap opera.  
  
¬† Meanwhile, the world would never be the same.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 2  
  
¬† NICOLAS CREEL LEISURELY FINISHED his Bombay Sapphire and tonic and put on his jacket. He was going for a walk. Actually, normal people went for walks. Billionaire corporate chieftains traveled high above the rabble. As he looked out the chopper window on the short ride across the Hudson to Jersey the skyscrapers below reminded him of how far he‚Äôd come. Creel had been born in West Texas, an area so big and barren with a seemingly endless flatness that it was said many who called it home were unaware there was any other place to live, or at least any way to get there.  
  
¬† Creel had spent exactly one year of his life in the Lone Star State before moving to the Philippines along with his army sergeant daddy. From there seven other countries had followed bang-bang-bang until Creel‚Äôs father was deployed to Korea and promptly blown to ash in what the army later described as an unfortunate logistical snafu. His widowed mother had remarried, and, years later, college followed for Creel, where he earned an engineering degree. After that, he cobbled together enough funds for an MBA run, but petered out after six months, choosing instead to learn the ropes in the real world.  
  
¬† The one valuable lesson his soldier daddy had taught him was that the Pentagon purchased more weapons than anyone and overpaid for every single one of them. And even better, when you needed more profit, you just asked for it and they gave it to you. It wasn‚Äôt their money, after all. And there was nothing easier to give away than someone else‚Äôs cash, especially s  
ince America had the biggest piggy bank in the world. It seemed a damn fine business to be in, because as Creel quickly found out, one really could sell the U.S. military $12,000 toilets and $9,000 hammers and actually get away with it under a mountain of legal trickery and congressional hearing mumbo-jumbo.  
  
¬† Creel had spent the next several decades building what was now the largest defense conglomerate in the world, the Ares Corporation. According to Forbes magazine he was the fourteenth richest person on the planet with over twenty billion dollars to his name.  
  
¬† His late mother had been a native Greek with a fiery temper and fierce ambition he‚Äôd inherited along with her dark good looks. After Creel‚Äôs father had been logistically snafued in Korea, she‚Äôd remarried to a man higher up the socioeconomic scale who‚Äôd shunted Creel off to boarding schools and not very good ones at that. While the sons of other wealthy men had everything handed to them, the outsider Creel endured their taunts and sweated and scraped for every nickel. Those experiences had given him armor for skin.  
  
¬† Naming his company after the Greek god of war was a tribute to the mother he‚Äôd loved above all others. And Creel was proud of what his company produced. The name stenciled on his four-hundred-foot motor yacht was Shiloh, one of the bloodiest battles in the American Civil War.  
  
¬† Though born on U.S. soil, Creel had never considered himself simply an American. Ares Corp. was based in the United States, but Creel was a citizen of the globe, having long ago renounced his U.S. citizenship. That suited his business well, for no country had a monopoly on war. Yet Creel spent as much time as he liked in the States because he had an army of lawyers and accountants who found every loophole in the stuttering linguistic morass called the U.S. tax code.  
  
¬† Creel had learned long ago that to protect his business he had to spread the wealth. Every major Ares weapon system contract was disseminated across all fifty states. His glossy, expensive ad campaigns touted that fact above all others.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne thousand suppliers spread across America, keeping you safe,‚Äù the Hollywood voice-over would proclaim in deeply resonant tones that made your skin tingle and your heart pound. It sounded very patriotic. It had actually been done for only one reason. Now if some bureaucrat tried to cut any of the pork, 535 members of Congress would rise up and strike the person dead for having the audacity to try and take jobs from their people. Creel had successfully implemented this same strategy in a dozen other countries as well. Just like war, the Americans did not have a monopoly on self-serving politicians.  
  
¬† Ares-built military jets flew over every major sporting event in the world, including the World Series, the Super Bowl, and the World Cup. How could you not get goose bumps when a tight formation of space age warships costing $150 million a pop came roaring overhead with enough firepower to easily take out every man, woman, and child in the place with a single strike? It was near poetic in its frightful majesty.  
  
¬† Ares‚Äôs global marketing and lobbying budget was three billion dollars per year. For that mammoth sum there wasn‚Äôt a major country with defense dollars to spend that didn‚Äôt hear the message over and over again: We are strong. We stand by you. We keep you safe. We keep you free. We are the only thing standing between you and them. And the pictures were just as compelling: barbecues and parades, flags waving, children saluting as tanks rolled by and planes soared overhead, and grim-faced soldiers with black-smudged faces threading through hostile territory.  
  
¬† There was no country on earth that could withstand that sort of heart-pumping message, Creel had found. Well, perhaps the Germans, but that was about it.  
  
¬† The way the commercials were scripted it was like the mighty Ares Corporation was giving the weapons away out of patriotic fervor instead of eternally being over budget and behind schedule. Or convincing defense departments to buy expensive war toys that were never even used while ignoring the lesser-priced items, like body armor and night-vision goggles, that grunts on the ground actually relied on to survive. It had worked brilliantly for decades.  
  
¬† Yet things were changing. People, it seemed, were growing tired of war. The attendance at the enormous trade conventions Ares put on annually had fallen for five years in a row. Now Ares‚Äôs marketing budget was bigger than its net income. That revealed only one truth: people weren‚Äôt buying what Creel was selling.  
  
¬† So he was currently sitting in a nice room in a building owned by his company. The big man sitting opposite him was dressed in jeans and combat boots, looking like a grizzly bear minus the fur. His face was tanned and worn, with what looked like either a bullet crater or the mother of all measles pocks on one cheek. His shoulders were thick and his hands huge and somehow menacing.  
  
¬† Creel didn‚Äôt shake hands.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs started,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen comrade Konstantin.‚Äù The man could not resist a smirk when he said this. ‚ÄúThey should just award him the Oscar now.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSixty Minutes is doing a story on it this weekend. Along with every other newsmagazine. The idiot Gorshkov‚Äôs making it easy on us.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about the incident?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the incident,‚Äù Creel pointed out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt worked before without boots on the ground.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in wars that stop at a hundred days or devolve into glorified gangland street fights. That doesn‚Äôt even pay the light bill, Caesar.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGive me the plan and I‚Äôll execute it, Mr. Creel, like always.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust be ready to go.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your dime,‚Äù said Caesar.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou bet it is.‚Äù  
  
¬† On the chopper ride back to the Ares Building, Creel eyed the city‚Äôs concrete, glass, and steel temples below. You‚Äôre not in West Texas anymore, Nick.  
  
¬† This, of course, wasn‚Äôt just about money. Or saving his company. Creel had enough money and regardless of what he did or didn‚Äôt do, Ares Corp. would survive. No, this was really about putting the world back into its proper structure. Things had been misaligned for long enough. Creel had grown weary of watching the weak and savage dictate to the strong and civilized. He was about to set things right. Some might claim he was playing God. Well, in a way he was. But even a benign god used violence and destruction to make his point. Creel intended to follow that model to the letter.  
  
¬† Initially there would be pain.  
  
¬† There would be loss.  
  
¬† There always was. Indeed, his own father had been a victim of keeping the spectrum of world power on a firm footing, so Creel quite clearly understood the level of sacrifice required. But in the end it would all be worth it.  
  
¬† He settled back in his seat.  
  
¬† The creator of Konstantin knew a little.  
  
¬† Caesar knew a little.  
  
¬† Only Nicolas Creel knew all.  
  
¬† As gods always did.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 3  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS THE ‚ÄòA‚Äô STAND FOR?‚Äù the man asked in fluent English with a Dutch accent layered over it.  
  
¬† Shaw looked at the gentleman standing opposite him at Passport Control in Schiphol Airport fifteen kilometers southwest of Amsterdam. One of the busiest airports in the world, it rested five meters below sea level with trillions of tons of swirling water nearby. Shaw had always considered this the height of engineering daring. Yet much of the entire country was below sea level, so they didn‚Äôt really have much of a choice on where to park the planes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù Shaw said, though he well knew what the man was referring to.  
  
¬† The fellow stabbed the photo page of Shaw‚Äôs passport with his finger.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere. Your given name is just the initial ‚ÄòA‚Äô. What does it stand for?‚Äù  
  
¬† Shaw gazed at his passport while the Dutchman looked on.  
  
¬† As befitted the tallest nation on earth, the passport man in his regulation uniform was six foot two, only one inch above a Dutchman‚Äôs average height, but still coming in three inches under Shaw‚Äôs imposing stature.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt stand for anything,‚Äù Shaw answered. ‚ÄúMy mother never gave me a Christian name, so I named myself for what I am. A Shaw. Because that is my surname,  
or at least it was my mother‚Äôs.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd your father had no objection to his son not taking his name?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a father to deliver a baby, only to make one.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd the hospital did not name you, then?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre all babies born in hospitals?‚Äù Shaw jabbed back with a smile.  
  
¬† The Dutchman stiffened and then his tone became less adversarial.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo Shaw. Irish, as in George Bernard?‚Äù  
  
¬† The Dutch were a wonderfully informed people, Shaw had found. Well educated and curious, loved to debate. He‚Äôd never had anyone before ask him about George Bernard Shaw.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCould be, but I‚Äôm Scottish. The Highlands. At least my ancestors came from there,‚Äù he added quickly, since he was holding an American passport, one of a dozen he actually possessed. ‚ÄúI was born in Connecticut. Perhaps you‚Äôve been there?‚Äù  
  
¬† The man said eagerly, ‚ÄúNo. But I would like very much to travel to America.

Shaw had seen that lustful look before. ‚ÄúWell, the streets aren‚Äôt really paved with gold and the women aren‚Äôt all movie stars, but there‚Äôs a lot to do and lots of room to do it in.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe one day,‚Äù the passport man said wistfully before reassuming his duties. ‚ÄúAre you here on business or pleasure?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBoth. Why come all this way and have to choose?‚Äù  
  
¬† The man chuckled. ‚ÄúAnything to declare?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIk heb niets aan te geven.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou speak Dutch?‚Äù he said in a surprised tone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt everyone?‚Äù  
  
¬† The man laughed and smacked Shaw‚Äôs passport with an old-fashioned ink stamp instead of the high-tech devices some countries were using. These, Shaw had heard, implanted a digital tracking device on the paper. He‚Äôd always preferred ink to tracking devices.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEnjoy your visit,‚Äù said Shaw‚Äôs new Dutch friend as he handed back the passport.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI intend to,‚Äù Shaw replied as he walked toward the exit and the train that would carry him to Centraal Station in Amsterdam in about twenty minutes.  
  
¬† From there it would only get more exciting. But first he had a role to play.  
  
¬† Because he had an audience.  
  
¬† In fact, they were watching him right now.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 4  
  
¬† THE CAB SHAW TOOK from the train station dropped him off at the grand Amstel Intercontinental Hotel. It housed seventy-nine rooms of great beauty, many with enviable views of the river Amstel, although Shaw was not here for the views.  
  
¬† Adhering to his role-playing over the next three days, Shaw was a tourist in town. There were few places more suited to that enterprise than Amsterdam, a city of 750,000 people, only half of them Dutch-born. He took a boat ride, enthusiastically snapping pictures of a city with more canals than Venice and nearly thirteen thousand bridges in a space of barely two hundred square kilometers, of which one-fourth was water.  
  
¬† Shaw was especially drawn to the houseboats, nearly three thousand of them, docked along the canals. They appealed to him because they represented roots. Even though they were floating on water, these boats never moved. They were handed down from one generation to the next or sold outright. What might that feel like, he wondered, to have such ties to one place?  
  
¬† He later donned shorts and running shoes and jogged across the wide-open spaces of Oosterpark near his hotel. In a very real sense Shaw had been running his whole life. Well, if things went according to plan that was going to end. Either that or he‚Äôd end up dead. He would gladly take the risk. In a way, he was dead already.  
  
¬† Sipping a coffee at the Bulldog, Amsterdam‚Äôs most famous caf√© chain, Shaw watched people go about their business. And he also eyed the men who were so very clearly watching him. It was pathetic, really, observing folks undertaking surveillance who didn‚Äôt have the least clue as to how to do it properly.  
  
¬† The next day he lunched at one of his favorite restaurants in the city, run by an elderly Italian. The man‚Äôs wife sat at one table reading the newspaper all day while her husband acted as ma√Ætre d‚Äô, waiter, chef, busboy, dishwasher, and cashier. The place only had four barstools and five tables, not counting the wife‚Äôs domain, and prospective customers had to stand in the doorway and be scrutinized by the husband. If he nodded, you were allowed to eat. If he turned away, you found another place to dine.  
  
¬† Shaw had never been turned away. Perhaps it was his imposing physical stature, or his magnetic blue eyes that seemed to snatch one up in their powerful embrace. But most likely it was because the owner and he had once worked together, and it wasn‚Äôt in the field of food and beverage.  
  
¬† That night Shaw put on a suit and attended the opera at the Muziektheater. After the performance was over he could‚Äôve walked back to his hotel, but he chose instead to head in the opposite direction. Tonight was why he‚Äôd really come to Holland. He was a tourist no longer.  
  
¬† As he approached the red-light district he observed some activity down a dark and particularly narrow alleyway. A little boy stood there in the shadows. Next to him was a rough-looking man with his zipper down and one large hand stuffed in the boy‚Äôs pants.  
  
¬† In an instant Shaw had changed direction. He slipped into the alley and placed a blow to the back of the man‚Äôs head. It was a measured strike, designed to stun, not kill, though Shaw was sorely tempted to finish off the predator. As the man fell unconscious to the pavement Shaw crammed a hundred euros in the boy‚Äôs hand and sent him off with a hard push and a dire warning in Dutch. As the child‚Äôs frantic footfalls echoed away, Shaw knew the boy would at least not starve or die tonight.  
  
¬† As he resumed his original route he noted for the first time that the old stock exchange was directly across from the hookers in the red-light. This struck him as odd until he thought about it. Cash and prostitution had always been bedfellows. He wondered if some of the ladies accepted company shares in lieu of euros as payment.  
  
¬† Even more ironic than the exchange‚Äôs close proximity to the whores was that the red-light district completely surrounded Oude Kerk, or Old Church, the city‚Äôs most ancient and largest house of worship. Built in 1306 as a simple wooden chapel, it had been constantly tinkered with and enlarged for the next two centuries. One jokester had even inlaid a brass pair of breasts into the pavement by the front entrance. Shaw had been inside a few times. What had struck him was the series of carvings on the choir benches depicting men having massive bowel movements. He could only assume that masses must have been really long in those days.  
  
¬† Saints and sinners, God and hookers, mused Shaw as he reached the middle of this strip of iniquity. The Dutch called the area the Walletjes, or ‚ÄúLittle Walls.‚Äù Presumably what happened behind the Walletjes stayed there. Tonight he was counting on that.  
  
¬† The red-light district was not that large, perhaps two canals long, but there was a lot packed into that pair of blocks. At night the prostitutes on duty here were the most beautiful. Many were stunning eastern Europeans who‚Äôd been brought to the country under false pretenses and then become ‚Äútrapped in the trade,‚Äù as it was delicately termed. Ironically, the night hookers were mostly for show. After all, who wanted to step through the libidinous portals with thousands watching? In the mornings and afternoons the district was quieter and that‚Äôs when the serious customers paid their visits to the far less comely but efficient ladies of the second and third eight-hour shifts.  
  
¬† The whores‚Äô rooms were difficult to miss, as they were all outlined in red neon tubing that was nearly blinding. The rooms also had fluorescent lighting such that the skimpy clothing the girls wore blazed like a summer sun. Shaw passed window after window where women stood, sometimes dancing, sometimes posing erotically. In truth most people who came here came to gawk, not fornicate, although the beds still racked up roughly half a billion euros in sales yearly.  
  
¬† Shaw kept his head down, his feet carrying him to one particular destination. He was almost there.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 5  
  
¬† THE LADY IN THE WINDOW was young and beautiful with raven hair that swirled around her bare shoulders. She was wearing only a white thong, spiked heels, and a cheap necklace wedged between her large breasts, the nipples of which were covered with sunflower pasties. An interesting choice, Shaw thought.  
  
¬† He kept eye contact with her as he threaded through the masses. The woman met him at the door, where he confirmed his interest. Even in her heels she was a foot shorter than him. In the window she‚Äôd looked bigger. Things on display often did look bigger. And better. When you got your purchase home, it didn‚Äôt seem nearly as special.  
  
¬† She shut the door and then closed the red curtains, the only sign one would get that the room and the lady were occupied now.  
  
¬† The space was small, with a sink, toilet, and, of course, a bed. Set next to the sink was a button. It was the one the hookers pushed in an emergency. Then the police would suddenly appear and drag away the customer who‚Äôd gone too far to satisfy himself. This was one of the best-patrolled areas in the city ‚Äì anything to keep the tax revenue coming. Shaw saw a second door in the bac  
k wall and then glanced away. In the next room the sounds of another happy customer were coming through loud and clear. Hooker digs were set side by side with cheap drywall or sometimes only a curtain in between. The business clearly did not require much space or frills in which to operate.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very good-looking,‚Äù she said in Dutch. ‚ÄúAnd large,‚Äù she added, gazing up at him. ‚ÄúAre you as big all over? Because I am not so big down there,‚Äù she added, now staring pointedly at his crotch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSpreekt u Engels?‚Äù Shaw said.  
  
¬† She nodded. ‚ÄúI speak English. It‚Äôs thirty euros for twenty minutes. But I‚Äôll do an hour for seventy-five. It‚Äôs a special, just for you,‚Äù she added matter-of-factly. She handed him a list in Dutch but that was also repeated at the bottom of the page in ten different languages including English, French, Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic. It was entitled, ‚ÄúThings I Will and Won‚Äôt Do.‚Äù  
  
¬† Shaw passed her back the paper. ‚ÄúIs your friend here?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting a long time to meet him.‚Äù He glanced toward the second door.  
  
¬† She appraised him in a different way now. ‚ÄúYes, he is here.‚Äù  
  
¬† She turned and led him to the door set in the back wall. Her exposed butt cheeks, though firm, still quivered slightly as she performed an exaggerated model‚Äôs sashay in front of him. He didn‚Äôt know if she did that out of habit or because the stilettos were too unstable.  
  
¬† The woman opened the door and motioned Shaw in. She left him there facing the old man seated at a small table where a plain meal had been laid: a wedge of cheese, a piece of cod, a fist of bread, and a bottle of wine.  
  
¬† The man‚Äôs face was a cache of wrinkles, the white beard scraggly and the small belly soft and round. The eyes peered out from under tufts of ramshackle snowy hair badly in need of pruning. The eyes caught on Shaw‚Äôs and held.  
  
¬† The man motioned to the table. ‚ÄúHungry? Thirsty?‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a second chair but Shaw chose not to use it. Indeed, if he had attempted to sit down, the man might have shot him, for there was a gun grasped in his left hand pointed right at Shaw and the prearranged instructions had been explicit. One did not sit. One did not eat or drink if one wanted to live.  
  
¬† Shaw‚Äôs gaze had already swept the tiny room. The only entry was the doorway he‚Äôd come through. He‚Äôd positioned himself so that he could keep one eye on this portal and one eye on the man. And his gun.  
  
¬† He shook his head and said, ‚ÄúThank you, but I already ate at the De Groene Lanteerne.‚Äù It was a cheap place with traditional Dutch food served in a room that was three hundred years old and looked it.  
  
¬† The dopey code words out of the way, the man rose, slid a piece of paper from his pocket, and handed it to Shaw.  
  
¬† Shaw glanced at the address and other information on the paper, ripped it up, and tossed the pieces into the toilet set against one wall and flushed it. Seemingly on cue the old man put on a beaten-up hat and patched coat and left.  
  
¬† Shaw could not leave yet. Sexual encounters typically lasted a bit longer than two minutes even for the teenage first-timers. And you never knew who was watching. Well, actually, he did. There were several of them.  
  
¬† He stepped back into the main room where the lady was stretched out, catlike, on her cot. The curtain was still drawn; her meter was still running.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you want to screw me now?‚Äù the woman asked in a slightly bored tone as she started to slide the thong down her legs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been paid for,‚Äù she added if he needed any inducement. ‚ÄúA full hour. And I will go off the list for another thirty euros.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNee, dank u,‚Äù he replied, smiling politely. If you were going to turn a lady down in the matter of sex, better you say it in her own language.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy not? Is there a problem?‚Äù she said, obviously offended.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm married,‚Äù he said simply.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo are most of the men who see me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere is your wedding ring?‚Äù she asked suspiciously.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNever wear it at work.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure you don‚Äôt want me?‚Äù Her tone of disbelief was as clearly etched as the look of incredulity on her face.  
  
¬† He hid his bemusement. She must be really new because her vanity was largely intact. The older whores would surely jump at the chance for full pay that included no humping.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAbsolutely sure.‚Äù  
  
¬† She slid her thong back up. ‚ÄúPity.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, pity,‚Äù he said. Actually, if things went according to plan, in two days hence he‚Äôd be in Dublin with the only woman he‚Äôd ever really loved. And also the reason why he had to get out. Now.  
  
¬† Still, even Shaw had to acknowledge, it was a big if. In his line of work, tomorrow was just another day to die.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 6  
  
¬† THERE IS ALWAYS A DAMN Tunisian, Moroccan, or Egyptian involved. Always. Shaw said this to himself. One slip with these gents and they‚Äôd rip your gonads off and force-feed them to you and say that Allah had told them to do it if they bothered to give you a reason at all. See you in paradise, infidel. Serve me well for eternity, filthy pig. He knew the speeches by heart.  
  
¬† He clenched the heavy suitcase in his right hand and held the left out from his side as the wiry Tunisian, eyes red, features grim, and teeth bared, patted him down.  
  
¬† Six men other than Shaw stood in the small upstairs room. It was a typical flat situated on a minor canal. High up, it was narrow as a snake hole, with knotted rope pulls in lieu of stair rails to enable the climber to make the near-vertical assault. One could easily become winded merely going from the first to the second floor of an Amsterdam canal residence.  
  
¬† The reason was historical, Shaw had learned. Centuries ago all these homes had been merchants‚Äô places of business. And back when they‚Äôd been constructed the only carpenters available were ship‚Äôs carpenters. These men, logically, had decided that what was good for a boat was good for a house and had built the stairs nearly straight up as was the practice on space-challenged ships. That‚Äôs also why most such homes had a steel beam like a ship‚Äôs prow jutting out from the top floor. They once had been used to haul up goods for sale and now were employed to hoist in furniture because there was no way in hell you‚Äôd get even a modest-sized couch up the stairs.  
  
¬† The night before, Shaw had left the red-light district, returned to his hotel, and informed the front desk that he was checking out. The clerk on duty there was undoubtedly in the pay of people who wanted to keep tabs on his movements and would relay this intelligence to them. Men would be dispatched to follow him as soon as he left the Intercontinental.  
  
¬† Since Shaw didn‚Äôt particularly want the extra company he left his bag and clothes behind and exited the hotel via the basement. That was why he‚Äôd stayed at the large Intercontinental, with its numerous exits; he needed to get away without being seen. Using the memorized information he‚Äôd gotten from the old man in the hooker‚Äôs digs, he rode in the back of an old farm truck to a destination outside the city where the land was broad and green and there was no water for at least a good ten feet. He made a few phone calls and the next evening took possession of the suitcase that the Tunisian was now attempting feverishly to wrest from his grip.  
  
¬† The far bigger Shaw suddenly wrenched the satchel free, sending the smaller man tumbling headfirst to the floor. The Tunisian rose, blood dripping down his nose, a knife clasped in his muscular hand.  
  
¬† Shaw turned to the leader of the pack, an Iranian who sat in a chair ‚Äì his miniature throne, Shaw could see ‚Äì and was eyeing him steadily.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWant me to show you the merchandise?‚Äù Shaw asked. ‚ÄúThen call off the hyena.‚Äù  
  
¬† The slender Persian, clad in crisply pressed knit slacks and a loose-fitting white long-sleeved shirt, waved his hand and the Tunisian‚Äôs knife disappeared, but the snarl remained.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou managed to lose my men last night,‚Äù he said to Shaw in a British accent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like company.‚Äù  
  
¬† He set the suitcase on the table, input two separate digital codes, slid his thumb through a scanner, and the titanium locks sprang free. Shaw  
closely observed the man from Tehran‚Äôs reaction to the little present lurking inside. The Iranian‚Äôs expression was clear: Christmas, ironically, had come early to Holland for the Allah worshiper from the Middle East.  
  
¬† Shaw announced, ‚ÄúOfficially, this is an RDD, radiological dispersal device, otherwise known as a suitcase nuke or dirty bomb.‚Äù He said all this in Farsi, which got an eyebrow hike from the Iranian.  
  
¬† The men gathered around. The Iranian gingerly touched the device with its wires, metal carcass, stainless steel tubes, and multiple LED readout screens.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow dirty?‚Äù the Iranian asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGamma radiation core with a nice dynamite kicker.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEnough to kill how many? An entire city?‚Äù  
  
¬† Shaw shook his head. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a weapon of mass destruction. It‚Äôs what we call in the trade a weapon of mass disruption. It‚Äôll kill some folks near the detonation site. And the radiation will nail some people too. The farther away from ground zero, the less damage.‚Äù  
  
¬† The Iranian looked displeased. ‚ÄúI was under the impression this device would kill thousands, knock down buildings.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is not a mushroom cloud boom-maker. If you want that you can go get plans off the Internet. But you‚Äôll find yourself stuck for necessary ingredients like highly enriched uranium. But what this baby will do is scare the shit out of an entire country, shut down the economy, and make people afraid to leave their homes. In a way, just as effective as the mushroom cloud, without all the mess. And a helluva lot cheaper to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† This seemed to appease the Iranian. He turned to Shaw after giving the bomb one last affectionate pat. ‚ÄúThe price?‚Äù  
  
¬† Shaw stood straighter towering over all of them. ‚ÄúThe same as the one on the term sheet we sent.

1mqi8ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlInet/comments/1mqi8ne/beryl_ax_adguard_home_vpn_full_setup_with_no_dns/,Beryl AX - AdGuard Home & VPN Full Setup with No DNS Leakages (v4.8.1 Firmware),"As promised, here is my process to fully setup my Beryl AX, with NordVPN and AdGuard Home enabled, and no DNS leaks. The current stable firmware, v4.8 leads to DNS leaks when using AdGuard Home with a VPN on the Beryl AX. The folks at Gl.iNet have been working to address that. As a result, the v4.8.1 snapshot on their download page, has fixed the issue. Hopefully, they release a stable version soon.



Let's start from scratch. I am going to take it for granted that you:

* know how to log into the router and have now logged into the router admin page
* have been able to connect to the internet, establish your WiFi connections and have your clients (i.e. phones, laptops, Roku etc.) connected to your network.

These instructions are purely to use the Beryl AX as a client (not as a server).



**CONFIGURING NORDVPN**

You can choose OpenVPN or WireGuard protocols. OpenVPN is an older protocol that is trusted, but is slow. WireGuard is a newer one with very few lines of code and is thus leaner. It is lean and secure and I would recommend using this (unless you have reasons to use OpenVPN). I actually configured both, but mainly use WG.



**OpenVPN**

* Click on 'VPN' and then 'OpenVPN Client'
* Click on the 'NordVPN' icon
*  It will ask to enter the service credentials. Note that this is NOT your username and pw that you use to log onto NordVPN. So how do you get these?
* Log into your NordVPN account and click on 'NordVPN' on the left sidebar. Scroll down the page and click on the 'Set up NordVPN manually' hyperlink
* Click on the 'Service credentials' tab and then on 'Verify email'



https://preview.redd.it/k761msbfp2jf1.png?width=2100&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c610b494ebc6d89bcdcafe6f8174efb44ed7f26

* You will be taken back to the verification page, where you will need to enter the code sent via email to you.
* Once back in NordVPN, you will be able to copy your credentials. Copy the Username and Password and drop them into the credentials for OpenVPN on the Beryl and hit 'Save and continue'
* From there, select either UDP, TCP or both and then select the server locations you would like. Best to choose servers closest to you. Once you have selected the server locations, hit 'Apply'.  NordVPN will then retrieve the configuration profiles for those selected servers



https://preview.redd.it/miuixj8lp2jf1.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&s=04110bd2c464bb658e5f79472f91908bc47d4d0f

Ôøº

* Once the list populates, scroll down until you find the server you want to use (NordVPN also has a 'Server recommendation' tool that is on the same page as the credentials. Once you have found a server you like, click on the three dots on the right side of the server information, and click 'Start'
* NordVPN will then start the server and you will be able to view the server details on the VPN dashboard

Ôøº

https://preview.redd.it/17xrr9ssp2jf1.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=0550978e0824cdc3fb177fb7c408ab2963862b8b



By default, you should be in Global Policy mode (i.e. all traffic has to flow through the selected VPN. On the VPN dashboard, select the cogwheel to the right of 'VPN Client' and turn on the kill switch (IP Masquerading should be on by default).

That is all you need to do for OpenVPN. I am only providing settings for a 'Global Mode'. You can enable the 'Policy Mode' where you can configure different VPN tunnels based on policy (i.e. you can have your Laptop, Phone go through a VPN Tunnel in the US, while your Roku can go through one in India (so that you can play the local media from India via Netflix etc.)



**WireGuard**



WireGuard is similar to OpenVPN.

* Once you have logged into your NordVPN account, then click on the 'NordVPN' link on the left sidebar and then on the page that loads, scroll all the way down, to 'Get Access Token'. You might need to verify your email again. Once the page loads, click on 'Generate new token' and choose the length of token validity. If you choose 'Doesn't expire' make sure you have MFA enabled in NordVPN to prevent unauthorized access.

* Copy the token and then on the Beryl AX, click on 'WireGuard Client', choose 'NordVPN' and paste the token into the 'Token' box. Hit 'Save and Continue'
* In the next window that pops up, choose the servers you want to use and then hit 'Apply'



https://preview.redd.it/q0qxketcq2jf1.png?width=2526&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f42dbc3bbb799f0a3017fced67112064d2dd7a6

Ôøº

You will now see the list of selected servers. As before, you can select one you like and start it. In the older versions of the firmware, you had to first stop any running server to start a WG one. But now you should be able to just hit start on the selected WG server, and it should stop any running server and start this one. Like before, check that the 'Kill Switch' is turned on to prevent leakage.

You can test the VPN, by opening a browser window in any of the devices connected to your Beryl WiFI SSID. In Google, type in 'What is my IP' and you can choose one of the many links to check it out. Of course, choose the NordVPN link too as that will show you clearly that you are connected to their servers.

https://preview.redd.it/6isc3pbkq2jf1.png?width=2624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3edcb0caf49965845bb28102e33be15248bb1b93



That is it for setting up the VPN. Not too bad, eh?



**ROUTER SETTINGS**

Before we configure and enable AdGuard, let's configure our Beryl AX router.

* IPv6: Many of us prefer to just disable IPv6 on the router. IPv6 can cause issues and it is recommended to turn it off. You can always turn it back on later if you wish. On the Beryl, you go to 'Network' ---> IPv6 and ensure it is turned off (it is turned off by default)
* IPv6 on MacBooks etc: Best to turn off IPv6 on your WiFi connections. Normally, you adjust your IPv6 settings from 'Automatic' to 'Link-Local only' in your WiFi settings for your connected WiFi network. I prefer to just kill IPv6 completely on my MacBook. Open Terminal and enter

   * 'sudo networksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi' to disable IPv6 completely
   * 'sudo networksetup -setv6automatic Wi-Fi' to enable IPv6 (if you want to at a later time)



Under Network ---> LAN

* Just do a check to ensure that the 'Router IP Address' is that of your Beryl, unless you have changed the subnet)
* Ensure the 'DHCP Server' is enabled

Under Network ---> DNS

* Make sure that the 'DNS Server Settings Mode' is set to 'Automatic' and that you can see 'DNS from Repeater' and 'DNS from VPN Client'
* Turn the 'Allow Custom DNS to Override VPN DNS' toggle to ON. Leave the other two switched off

https://preview.redd.it/irtfbfwtr2jf1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=e554277aeaa37320a99a890ffe534eaf896d485c

 Under System ---> Security

* Change the HTTPS Port under 'Admin Panel' to be something other than 443. I just use 444. This is to avoid port conflict if you decide to enable https for the Admin Panel in AGH

That's it for router settings. Now onto the final hurdle - AdGuard Home



**ADGUARD HOME SETTINGS**

* Click on 'Applications' on the left sidebar and then on 'AdGuard Home'
* Toggle on 'Enable AdGuard Home' and hit 'Apply'
* Once 'AdGuard Home' is enabled, then you can toggle on 'AdGuard Home Handle Client Requests' also and hit 'Apply'. Thus both the options should be switched on once you are done



https://preview.redd.it/plfr3zr0s2jf1.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=683479c29ba898419554f283a7b0e44149658706



One thing to note here - It is not necessary to restart ADGuard Home after changes are applied, as most changes are applied dynamically. However, there are some times, when you will need to restart the service (updates to ADGuard Home, changes to the config.yaml file etc). What I do is, that after I have configured everything on the router (WiFi, DNS, VPN, AGH) and tested to ensure it is working, I then just reboot the router, which will stop and restart your AGH service. Do note, that any time you stop AGH service, you will lose all your query logs. The query logs get wiped during each restart of AGH and thus, with any reboot of the router that has AGH installed on it

Now click on the ‚ÄòSettings Page‚Äô hyperlink to go to the main AGH settings. You might need to edit the URI in the browser if it doesn‚Äôt open. Depending on browser settings, you might need to use https or http

The 'Dashboard' tab is where you see all the outputs. Nothing to configure here really (can disable protection if you want or refresh the stats)

General Settings



Click on the ‚Äò Settings‚Äô tab and then ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô settings

* Ensure the ‚ÄòBlock domains using filters and hosts files‚Äô is checked. I like to keep the filter updates at 12 hours, some like it more frequently. I believe the filters get updated one or two times a day, so I don‚Äôt see a need to make my poor Beryl work harder than it needs to
* Can leave the other three blank (unless you want to use these). Remember, you have some pretty awesome filters that you can use instead of enabling these generic settings
* Under Logs configuration, enable log. An important note here is that these query log files can get massive and that space, is eating into the router‚Äôs memory (which probably would be around 70% after configuring the VPN and starting AGH (and before any lists). Some users have experienced between 200MB and 300 MB per week (depending on how you have configured AdGuard. If AGH is handling client requests, you will have a ton of queries). I just keep mine at 7 days for now (both the Query logs and Statistics log). The Statistics log doesn‚Äôt take nearly this much space, but rather a fraction of(as it is only a few charts instead of written text). You can thus increase the statistic log if you wish - but do so only if yo really will be referring to it. I might ultimately just make Query 24 hours and stats 7 days
* As before, enable statistics and choose the duration
* Don‚Äôt forget to hit Save for each option



DNS Settings

Click on ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô and ‚ÄòDNS‚Äô settings.

  
*Upstream Servers*

* The upstream DNS servers are the ones that will be contacted by the Beryl to help resolve domains that it can‚Äôt resolve locally. Think of the Beryl as a teaching assistant, teaching a class. You, the student (let‚Äôs say the phone or computer on the Beryl‚Äôs network), asks the TA (Beryl) a question. The TA gives you a blank look, and decides to reach out to the Professor (Upstream Server), for the answer. The professor (Upstream DNS server) then gives the answer (domain name resolution) to the TA (Beryl router).
* Since we want to use encrypted DNS, we will need to input one or more encrypted DNS server addresses in here. You can choose to use DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS or DNS over QUIC. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is the most mature among them all.
* If you have subscribed to AdGuard‚Äôs Personal DNS, then you will just need to enter those addresses in here. AdGuard generates DoH, DoT and QUIC addresses for each configured device on the server. There is a 4th option (which I really like and use), which is the link generator, that generates an upstream server link, for your specific device and server. If you use that option, you can just drop those links into this box.
* For everyone that is not using the Personal DNS plan, you can use any Encrypted DNS servers in here. I would advise to put in at least 2 or 3. By using multiple Encrypted servers, AdGuard can choose the fastest and reliable one, to resolve the domain.
*  Make sure you DON‚ÄôT use a plain IPv4 or IPv6 address here.
* Among the really good ones are, Cloudflare, Quad9, Mullvad, ControlD, AdGuard etc.
*  Each of the above offers multiple encrypted addresses to suit different requirements. You can choose just filtering out ads, or ads and malware, or ads, malware and adult content etc.
* But there is a caveat - choosing servers that filter out ads and malware, doesn‚Äôt give you insight into what is being filtered. You are solely relying on on that server to filter out ALL the ads or ALL the malware by using them. It could happen, that what you consider a nuisance, Google Upstream does not.
* Thus my advice, is to get an encrypted DNS server, with DNNSEC, no filters and no logs. Why? Because you just want the dang upstream server, to do its job by encrypting your queries. You will provide that server with the necessary filters to filter out ads, malware, adult content etc. By doing so, you can ensure you give that upstream server, the highest quality filter blocklist that‚Äôs needed to address your requirement - rather than relying on that same upstream server‚Äôs, one size fits all generic list, that has no transparency

*Next choose ‚ÄòParallel requests‚Äô for fast queries*

*Fallback DNS servers* are those, that will be used in place of the Upstream ones, should the upstream ones fail). If you have used 3 or more already in the Upstream box, you really don‚Äôt need to enter anything here. It is unlikely that all 3 or more DNS servers from different companies will fail together. Of course since you might have a few more addresses you like and want to use, you can drop those into the fallback. Personally, I would rather you drop those servers into the Upstream servers box as might get used sometime, since AGH will be checking out all the servers in that box (using one of the methods like Parallel). In the fallback box, they will only get approached, should everything in the upstream fail.

*Bootstrap DNS Servers*: Now before AGH can send the query to the upstream server to be resolved, it needs to be able to connect to the upstream server somehow. If you have chosen say, Cloudflare address, AGH needs to find a way to connect with that address. That is where bootstrap servers come in. AGH will use the bootstrap server(s) to perform an unencrypted DNS lookup of the encrypted Upstream server‚Äôs hostname. Once the IP address is known, then AGH can send the encrypted packet to the upstream server. 

Notice that the bootstrap is just a plain DNS server. Hence choose a reliable and fast server. These are what I would drop into the bootstrap box (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 9.9.9.10, 149.112.112.10). Essentially Cloudflare and Quad9. Cloudflare is considered among the fastest, if not THE fastest DNS server.

*Private Reverse Servers*

* For Private reverse DNS servers, just use your router‚Äôs (Beryl AX) IP address (192.168.8.1). If you are using another subnet with a different address, just use that address. Don‚Äôt leave it blank. In my limited experience, leaving it blank leads to higher latency. If you leave it blank, it will use 127.0.0.1 as the address
* Check both the boxes (Use private reverse DNS resolvers, Enable reverse resolving of clients‚Äô IP addresses)
* Hit ‚ÄòApply‚Äô



*In the DNS Server configuration*

* Leave the default numbers as is
* Check Enable EDNS, Enable DNSSEC, Disable resolving of IPv6 addresses. You can leave the EDNS unchecked if you like. EDNS gives you more geographical accuracy and less latency at the expense of a little privacy. Pick your poison.
* For Blocking mode, choose Null IP
* Blocked response TTL (3600)
* Turn on ‚ÄòOptimistic caching'
* Hit ‚ÄòSave‚Äô



**Encryption Settings**

* Now go to Settings ‚Äî> Encryption Settings
* We are only a client (not server) and hence we really don‚Äôt care about encryption for queries that stay local.
*  If you would like the admin login interface for the Beryl to use https, then first, check the ‚ÄòEnable Encryption‚Äô on top, then check the ‚ÄòRedirect to HTTPS automatically and then uncheck the ‚ÄòEnable Encryption‚Äô box. Hit save at the bottom. This is not really required as all the traffic we are talking about, is local. Thus we don't have to worry about encryption.



**Filters**

Now go to Filters  ‚Äî> DNS blocklists

Listen to me here - don‚Äôt get the urge to use every list possible in there. For one there is too much redundancy. Secondly, the Beryl AX is a small little baby. It doesn‚Äôt have that much space. You enable 10 of these lists, with tens of thousands of lines each, and your router will go to sleep...forever.... with Fido, who you told the kids, went to the ""Farm."" It is a pain to then try and rectify a freeze due to overload.

IMO the best lists are by HaGeZi. You can see all his lists here (scroll down to see them all).

I would choose the following if you are just starting out:

* HaGeZi‚Äôs Pro Blocklist: Click on 'Add blocklist' ---> 'Choose from the list'  and then choose the Pro blocklist.
* Along with the Pro, choose the following three (HaGeZi has recommended to add these for AdGuard Home):

   * HaGeZi's Badware Hoster Blocklist
   * HaGeZi's DynDNS Blocklist
   * Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List

This is ALL you need when you are starting out. If you later feel confident that the router is doing okay and is not struggling, then you can add the following:

* HaGeZi‚Äôs Threat Intelligence Feeds - The one in the list is the full version with over 630K entries. Instead, go again to 'Add blocklist' ---> 'Add a custom list'. Go to the HaGeZi DNS list page on GitHub, copy the Threat Intelligence Feeds Medium list for AdGuard, and paste it into the 'Enter a URL......' box and hit 'Save' (the 'Enter Name' field will auto-populate once you hit 'Save')

For now DON‚ÄôT even think of any other list for the router. It will crash. HaGeZi‚Äôs lists are truly excellent with almost 0 redundancy. They also include rules sourced from the other lists you see in the database.

That‚Äôs it! Give one last look, then go to the main router page and reboot the router once you are satisfied everything is okay.

* Once the router reboots:
* Check your IP address by Googling 'What is my IP'?
* Check for DNS Leaks. Google 'DNS Leak Test' for links. I like to use the one by ControlD

 Make sure AdGuard is running properly by using the AdGuard Diagnostic Test page. Scroll down to the 'AdGuard DNS' section. You should see that the Public Server is in green font and running. You will need to make sure you turn off or pause any AdGuard software or app on the device you are using to test the Beryl AX. So if you are using your Phone to open this diagnostic link, make sure you turn off AdGuard on the phone before opening the link. Else the results shown will be for your phone and not the Beryl.



Finally, you will be able to see all the queries in the 'Query Log' in the AdGuard Home Settings Page (where we configured the DNS and filters etc. - it is the last tab).

BTW, whenever you make changes to the DNS, reverse DNS etc., it is good to also renew the DHCP lease of your WiFi connection. Rebooting the router will ensure it disconnect and reconnects, which is great. Otherwise, just turn off the WiFi and turn it back on and it should do the same thing.

Okay, I am bushed and need my coffee after all this typing. If you find any errors, please comment and I am happy to correct them.

1mqi6kr,https://i.redd.it/7jiwc377u2jf1.jpeg,Vacuum-extracted cold brew. My summer project.,"After going down a few rabbit holes I stumbled upon some techniques promising cold brew in 15 minutes by using vacuum extraction. I was intrigued, and after trying it I was hooked.

##The gear I use

- FoodSaver vacuum sealer with an accessory port
- Jar attachment with tube adapter for accessory port
- 2 x 64 oz mason jars
- kitchen scale
- stirring implement that can fit into a 64oz mason jar (I use a wooden spoon)
- fine mesh stainless steel filter for 64 oz jar
- 32 oz jar (or other vessel) for serving
- pour over filter stand and paper filters (optional)

##Measurements

The amounts below were chosen so that I can make six batches with a 2 lb bag of beans.

- 1/3 lb (150g) coffee beans, medium roast, ground coarse
- 40 oz / 5 cups (1125 mL) filtered water (2:15 ratio for 1:1 concentrate)

##Technique

- Place grounds in a 64 oz mason jar. Fill with 1 1/4 c water (300 mL) and stir so that all the grounds are wet. Fill with the remaining 3 3/4 c (or 825 mL).
- Attach jar attachment to tube and tube to accessory port. Make sure the FoodSaver is closed so it will remove air. Press ‚ÄúVacuum‚Äù. The first time you do this, it should look almost like the coffee is fizzing. It will stop vacuuming after about 10-20 seconds, then the seal light will come on briefly before shutting off.
- Wait 30 seconds, then press ‚ÄúVacuum‚Äù again. This will run for a shorter time before stopping. The liquid/grounds line inside the jar should be an inch or so higher than when it started.
- release the pressure by removing the tube from the jar or by unclipping one side of your FoodSaver.
- Repeat the previous three steps three more times, for a total of four cycles with two vacuums each.
- Filter the grounds from the brew. I screw the stainless steel filter inverted on top of the 64 oz jar, set the other jar on top of the filter, and invert the two jars so the water goes pouring into the second jar.
- (optional) once the water is transferred over you can use the pour over filter to filter out any remaining oils and fines.

I typically make two batches at once which gets my family through most of a week.

##Results

The coffee is definitely strong - I don‚Äôt have a refractometer so I can‚Äôt give you a guarantee in the concentration, but I would guess it‚Äôs pretty close to what you‚Äôd get for a typical overnight brew.

I also taste less bitterness when I make it this way. With paper filtering it almost all the fines are removed.

Jonathan Reeve had always thought of his camera as a witness. That was the beauty of photography: it captured truth. The frame was a slice of reality, frozen in time, immune to change.

Or at least, that was what he believed‚Ä¶ until the first time the camera lied to him.

It was nothing, at first‚Äîthe kind of thing you‚Äôd almost miss.

He was sitting at the window of a caf√© on 6th Street, testing an old film camera he‚Äôd bought from a pawnshop. The place had smelled faintly of dust and old varnish when he‚Äôd stepped inside, the air heavy with a stale quiet. The owner had been the kind of man who didn‚Äôt talk much;¬† his watery eyes barely lifting as he wrapped the camera in newspaper and pushed it across the counter.

Jonathan hadn‚Äôt recognized the model. No brand. No engraving. Just heavy, cold metal that seemed to drink the warmth from his palms.

That morning, the light outside was bright and flat, bleaching the colors from the street. A bus lumbered past. People shuffled by with their heads down, lost in their own fog of thoughts. He lifted the camera, wound the lever with a dry *whirrr-click*, and pressed the shutter.

When the film developed later that evening, the image looked almost exactly as it should. Almost.

The man who had been leaning against the lamppost in the real moment, the one in the brown coat, scrolling through his phone, wasn‚Äôt looking at his phone in the photograph.

He was staring directly at Jonathan.

And his face‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt casual, or bored, or even surprised. It was fixed. Intent. Eyes wide, unblinking, the look of someone who had been waiting.

Jonathan went back to the caf√© the next day, expecting to spot the man again, but the lamppost was empty. The street felt oddly hollow without him. He laughed it off. Photography did this sometimes, caught strange, in-between expressions that the brain didn‚Äôt register at the time.

Except it happened again.

Three days later, Jonathan took a photograph of a quiet residential street at dusk. The kind of street where nothing much happens, where the only sound was the faint *whhhht* of wind curling through bare branches.

When the print came back, the man in the brown coat was there. Jonathan swore; he *knew* the man hadn‚Äôt been in the frame when he pressed the shutter. This time he stood further away, halfway down the block, but the stare was the same: flat, patient, unblinking.

Jonathan told himself he was just misremembering. Memory played tricks. Maybe the man really had been there, and Jonathan‚Äôs attention had just‚Ä¶ slid over him.

But it kept happening.

The man would appear in shots where Jonathan was certain he hadn‚Äôt seen him. Sometimes he was subtle,¬† a blurred face in a passing crowd, a dim shape in a reflection,¬† but always looking, always *there*.

The fourth time, Jonathan didn‚Äôt notice the man at first. His attention caught on something else entirely.

The sky.

That evening had been warm, almost golden, the air heavy with the last breath of daylight. But in the photograph, the sky was a deep, bruised purple, threaded with long, jagged streaks of black, as if something had clawed through the clouds.

He flipped through the other photos from that roll. Each one grew darker, more oppressive. The golden light was gone, replaced by a weight that seemed to press out of the paper itself.

Jonathan set the prints down. The camera sat on the table, its metal cold against his fingertips.

It wasn‚Äôt just recording the world.

It was seeing more than it should.

And somewhere deep in his chest, he began to feel it,¬† that faint but undeniable pressure of small coincidences stacking neatly into something deliberate.

# Chapter 2¬† The Woman in Green

Jonathan told himself he would stop using the camera.

He set it on the shelf above his desk, covered it with an old scarf, and let it gather dust. For three days, he avoided even looking at it. He told himself he was being overly dramatic, that maybe he just needed space from photography for a while.

On the fourth day, the light outside was perfect. It was late afternoon in the park, the kind of light that turns leaves into thin stained glass. Families were out, children running between the benches, couples strolling with coffee cups. Jonathan‚Äôs hands itched for the camera.

He gave in.

The scarf slid off the shelf, the camera heavy and cold in his hands. He wound the lever, the *whirrr-click* sounding louder than it should have in the quiet apartment, and headed for the park.

It felt good at first to frame the world again. He crouched near a pond where the surface rippled like dark silk. Ducks drifted lazily. A child leaned over the railing, giggling as her mother held her coat. Jonathan lifted the camera, pressed the shutter, heard the soft *snip* of the moment being taken.

He shot trees, benches, the old man who always fed pigeons near the fountain. The familiar rhythm returned, winding and clicking, winding and clicking, the sounds almost meditative.

He didn‚Äôt notice the woman in green until he developed the film that night.

She stood in the background of three separate shots, always in the same long green coat, her hair a sheet of black against her shoulders. In one image, she was at the far edge of the pond, hands in her pockets. In another, she leaned against the fountain. In the third, she was on the path behind him, just out of focus, her gaze fixed toward the camera.

The coat might have been a coincidence. The dark hair, too. But the eyes‚Ä¶ even blurred by distance, they had the same unblinking quality as the man in the brown coat.

Jonathan stared at the prints until his eyes watered. He thought about the dates, the spacing between the shots. For her to appear in all of them, she would have had to move quickly through the park, always staying behind him, always finding the frame.

When he finally looked up from the photos, the scarf had slipped halfway off the camera. He could have sworn he had replaced it earlier.

The room felt smaller. The shadows in the corners seemed to lean toward him.

He covered the camera again and turned off the lights, but in the darkness, the faint *click* of a shutter echoed in his mind.

# Chapter 3¬† The First Future

Jonathan woke to the sound of rain.

It wasn‚Äôt heavy, just a constant soft *shhhhhh* against the windows, a sound that made the air in the apartment feel colder than it was. The light that seeped through the curtains was a dull, washed-out gray. The kind of day where you stay in, drink coffee, and listen to the storm.

He didn‚Äôt plan to take any photographs. Not at first. But the rain gave the streets outside a glassy sheen, turning the reflections of buildings and traffic lights into wavering shapes. He found himself standing by the window with the scarf in his hands before he even realized he‚Äôd taken it down.

The camera sat there, waiting.

It had weight, more than its size seemed to allow. Cold seeped into his fingers the moment he touched it, as though it had been sitting in ice. He wound the lever, the *whirrr-click* louder than the rain, and aimed at the street below.

There was no one in frame but a man with a red umbrella crossing at the corner. Jonathan clicked the shutter once, then again. Something about the umbrella against the slate-colored street pleased his eye.

Later, when the photographs developed, his stomach turned.

In the first image, the man with the red umbrella was still crossing, the street empty around him. But in the second image, taken only seconds later, the world had changed.

The street was littered with debris. Shards of glass, torn paper, and something darker smeared across the wet pavement. Cars sat abandoned at odd angles, doors hanging open. The buildings in the background looked scorched, their windows black. And the man with the red umbrella was lying on the ground, face turned away from the lens, the umbrella beside him like a collapsed, blood-red flower.

Jonathan stared at the prints for a long time. There was no way this could be a trick of light or some kind of double exposure. The change was too specific, too violent.

He pressed his palms to his eyes until colors swam in the dark behind them. When he lowered his hands, the photos were still there.

For the rest of the day, he avoided looking out the window. Every time a car passed, he tensed. Every time footsteps echoed in the hall outside, he held his breath.

That night, he dreamed of the photograph. Not the act of taking it, but of standing in the street from the second image, the air thick with the smell of burnt plastic and something coppery and wet. Somewhere nearby, water dripped steadily ‚Äî *plink‚Ä¶plink‚Ä¶plink*. He turned in the dream, expecting to see the man in the brown coat or the woman in green, but instead, there was a shape in the distance. Tall, thin, its face lost in shadow, unmoving.

He woke before it reached him.

Jonathan lay in the dark for hours, listening to the faint hum of the refrigerator in the next room. The sound felt too loud, too close, as if the walls themselves were leaning inward. He thought about the photo, about how impossible it was, and yet‚Ä¶

Somewhere deep in his chest, the pressure he‚Äôd first felt when the man in the brown coat appeared was growing heavier. The camera wasn‚Äôt just showing the present.

It was showing what was coming.

# Chapter 4¬† The Self-Portrait

Jonathan hadn‚Äôt meant to take the camera out again.

For two days, he left it covered on the desk. He tried to keep busy,¬† reading, washing dishes, rearranging books on the shelf, but his thoughts always drifted back to the photograph of the ruined street.

He had checked the news compulsively. There was no mention of an explosion, no accident, no reason for the image to exist. But it did exist, and that was enough to gnaw at him.

The camera sat under the scarf like a sleeping animal. Silent, patient.

By the third night, Jonathan couldn‚Äôt take the tension anymore. He wanted to prove something to himself, though he wasn‚Äôt sure what. Maybe it was just a camera after all. That the photos weren‚Äôt predictions, just coincidences, his mind was twisting into something worse.

So he decided to take a picture of himself.

The idea felt both absurd and dangerous. Still, he set up the tripod in the living room, the legs creaking as they extended. He clipped the camera into place, wound the lever, and stepped back until he was framed in the viewfinder‚Äôs dim reflection. His face looked pale in the low lamplight, his eyes ringed with exhaustion.

He pressed the timer, heard the faint *tick-tick-tick* of the mechanism winding down, and the *click* of the shutter.

The sound seemed to linger in the room longer than it should have.

When the film was developed, his stomach went cold.

The photograph showed him sitting in a chair, but not the chair in his living room. This one was wooden, heavy, with strange carvings down the arms. His wrists were tied to it with thick rope. A blindfold covered his eyes. The background was dim and stone-walled, as if underground. Shadows pooled in the corners of the frame.

And there were figures.

They stood in a half-circle behind him, their faces hidden under deep hoods, their robes patterned with symbols he didn‚Äôt recognize. In the center of the group, taller than the rest, was a figure whose hood didn‚Äôt hide a face at all. Instead, there was only darkness.

Jonathan dropped the print. It slid across the table and landed face down.

For a long time, he didn‚Äôt move. The apartment seemed to have grown quieter, so quiet he could hear the faint scrape of something in the walls, like nails dragging along wood.

He turned the photograph over again, searching for any detail that might prove it was fake. But the details were too sharp, too specific. The frayed fibers of the rope. The cracks in the stone floor. The folds of fabric in the nearest robe.

The pressure in his chest was worse now, almost unbearable. He looked toward the window and froze.

On the street below, directly under the lamp, stood the woman in green. She wasn‚Äôt moving. Her head was tilted slightly upward, as if she could see him.

Jonathan stepped back from the window. When he looked again, she was gone.

The photograph of himself sat on the table, the faces of the hooded figures still hidden, still watching.

# Chapter 5¬† The First Visit

The knock came just after midnight.

Jonathan had been sitting in the living room with the television on, not watching it, just letting the flicker of the screen keep the corners of the room from feeling too dark. The rain had stopped hours ago, but the streets outside looked slick, reflecting the yellow streetlamps like still water.

The sound was sharp. Three knocks.

He muted the television and sat completely still.

No one knocked on his door this late. Not neighbors, not delivery people, no one. His first thought was of the woman in green. Or worse,¬† the hooded figures from the photograph.

Another three knocks. Slower this time.

Jonathan rose carefully from the couch, every floorboard under his feet groaning like it wanted to betray him. He approached the door, stopping just shy of the peephole. He didn‚Äôt want to look through it, didn‚Äôt want to see what might be waiting there.

The third set of knocks was softer, almost a tap. Then silence.

Minutes passed. Jonathan finally forced himself to glance through the peephole. The hallway was empty.

He turned the locks anyway, one by one, each metallic *clink* echoing in the stillness, and opened the door an inch. The corridor beyond was lit only by the single flickering light at the far end. The air smelled faintly of damp concrete and something else, something faintly metallic, like rust.

Something was lying just outside his door.

A small envelope. Thick paper, the kind that felt almost like cloth under his fingers. No writing on the outside, no address, no seal.

He brought it in, sat at the table, and opened it.

Inside was a single black-and-white photograph.

It was another image of him, clearly taken without his knowledge. He was asleep in his own bed, his head turned toward the window. In the photograph, the window was open. A figure stood beside the bed, leaning over him. It was tall, robed, and hooded, its head bent in a way that suggested it was listening closely to something.

Jonathan‚Äôs breath came faster. The camera sat across the room on the desk, still under the scarf. But this photograph hadn‚Äôt come from his camera; it was taken from a different angle entirely, closer, almost intimate.

He turned the photo over. On the back, scrawled in a shaky hand, was a single word:

**‚ÄúSoon.‚Äù**

Jonathan shoved the picture back into the envelope and dropped it on the counter, as though it might burn him if he held it too long. He pulled the curtains closed and checked every lock on every window, even the ones in the bathroom.

The building seemed quieter than usual. The hum of the refrigerator had stopped. He could hear his own breathing and the faint *drip‚Ä¶drip‚Ä¶drip* of water in the pipes.

That night, he didn‚Äôt sleep.

Somewhere in the early hours, as the sky outside began to pale toward dawn, he thought he heard footsteps in the hall again. Slow, deliberate, stopping just outside his door.

This time, they didn‚Äôt knock.

# Chapter 6¬† The Photograph That Disappears

By the next morning, Jonathan convinced himself the knock at his door had been nothing. A prank. A drunk neighbor. His mind was playing tricks on him.

But the envelope on the counter was proof it hadn‚Äôt been just a dream.

He made coffee, the bitter scent filling the apartment, and sat staring at the envelope. The light through the blinds painted pale stripes across the table, inching closer to the photograph inside. He told himself not to look again, but his hands moved on their own, sliding the picture out.

The image was the same: himself asleep, the robed figure leaning over him,¬† but something was wrong.

The hooded figure wasn‚Äôt leaning anymore. It was standing upright now. And its head was turned toward the camera.

Jonathan‚Äôs pulse thudded in his ears. He was certain the photograph hadn‚Äôt looked like this before.

He stared at the grainy outline of the hood, at the deep black where a face should have been. There was no sign of a mouth or eyes, yet somehow he felt it was aware of him. Not just in the moment the photo had been taken, but *now*.

He shoved it back in the envelope and stepped away. He thought about throwing it out, but that would mean touching it again, and he didn‚Äôt want to feel the weight of the paper in his hands.

Instead, he went to the camera. It sat beneath the scarf like a dormant thing. He hesitated, then pulled the fabric away.

The lens seemed to catch the light in a way that didn‚Äôt make sense, as if something faint and moving was reflected there, even though the room was still.

He didn‚Äôt mean to take a photo, but the next thing he knew, the *click* of the shutter was echoing in the room.

The photo developed in the bathroom, the chemical smell sharp in the air. Jonathan waited, feeling his heart in his throat. When the image came into focus, he almost dropped it.

It was his own kitchen. Empty.

But in the very corner, nearly lost in shadow, was the woman in green.

She wasn‚Äôt facing the camera this time. She was standing with her back to him, as though looking at something on the wall. Her hand was pressed against it, fingers splayed wide. And there was something about the way her arm was angled, as if she was pushing against a door only she could see.

Jonathan checked the kitchen. The corner in the photograph was bare. No woman, no door, nothing but peeling paint.

When he went back to the bathroom, the photograph was gone. The developing tray sat empty, the water still rippling faintly as though something had just disturbed it.

Jonathan froze. The apartment had gone completely silent.

That was when he noticed the scarf was back over the camera.

# Chapter 7¬† The Stranger at the Caf√©

Jonathan didn‚Äôt want to be in his apartment anymore. The air there felt heavier each day, like it was pressing in on him.

So he took his camera,¬† still covered, and left it locked in his desk drawer, then headed down the block to a small caf√© he sometimes used for editing work. It was mid-morning, the streets damp from an earlier drizzle, the sky the color of tarnished silver.

The caf√© was warm inside, smelling of burnt espresso and sugar. A few people sat scattered at tables, bent over laptops or phones. Jonathan chose a seat near the back, where he could see the front door.

He‚Äôd been there maybe fifteen minutes when the man walked in.

The stranger was tall, with neatly combed hair and a coat that looked expensive but oddly outdated, as though it had been tailored decades ago. His skin was pale, almost sallow, and his eyes didn‚Äôt quite match; one was a watery blue, the other a cloudy grey that seemed to catch the light in strange ways.

The man didn‚Äôt go to the counter. He scanned the room until his gaze landed on Jonathan, then walked straight to his table.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Jonathan Pierce,‚Äù the man said, not asking. His voice was low, almost flat, but there was something in it that made Jonathan‚Äôs stomach tighten.

Jonathan nodded stiffly, unsure if denying it would even matter.

The man sat without being invited. He placed a small object on the table between them, a film canister, old and scuffed, the metal top dented.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs yours,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúYou left it behind.‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt reach for it. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt lost any film,‚Äù he said.

The man‚Äôs mouth twitched, almost a smile, but not quite. ‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúBut you will. And when you do, you‚Äôll want this back.‚Äù

Jonathan glanced around. The barista was wiping down the counter. No one else seemed to be paying attention.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Jonathan asked.

The man leaned in slightly. The cloudy eye seemed almost to pulse, like there was movement beneath its surface. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about what I want,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about what‚Äôs coming. You‚Äôve seen pieces of it. You‚Äôve shown us pieces of it. And soon, the door will open.‚Äù

Jonathan felt a prickle of cold along his arms. The words echoed in his head, uncomfortably close to the image of the woman in green pressing her hand against the wall.

He stood abruptly, chair legs scraping the floor. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt follow him. But as Jonathan left the caf√©, he glanced back once,¬† and the stranger was still sitting at the table, staring after him.

The film canister was gone.

# Chapter 8 The Thing in the Negative

That night, Jonathan tried to work.

He set up his enlarger in the bathroom, the red bulb casting its dim, sickly glow. The air was warm and wet with the chemical smell of developer and fixer. The hum of the ventilation fan was the only sound.

He told himself he would print some older shots, nothing recent, nothing from the park or the apartment. Something safe.

But the first strip of negatives he pulled from the sleeve wasn‚Äôt one he recognized.

They weren‚Äôt labeled, and the film was cold to the touch, almost damp, as if it had just been taken from somewhere wet. The frames looked warped, the edges curling slightly.

Curiosity overrode caution. He slid the strip into the enlarger and projected the first frame onto the easel.

It was his apartment, but not as it was now. The walls were darker, the ceiling lower, the shadows thicker, like the place was sinking in on itself. In the center of the room was something that might have been human, hunched low, its limbs wrong, too long in some places, too short in others.

Jonathan‚Äôs breath caught.

The face,¬† if it was a face, was blurred into a smear, but the way it seemed to *tilt* toward the camera made his skin crawl. It gave the impression of something smiling, even without a mouth.

He switched to the next frame.

This one was closer. The thing was in his kitchen now, crouched in the same corner where the woman in green had stood in the vanished photograph. The wall behind it was cracked open, a jagged line revealing blackness so deep the red light of the darkroom seemed to fade inside it.

Jonathan switched again.

The third frame was almost completely black. But in the grain of the shadows, something was moving,¬† faint lines, curves, and ridges, like an eye trying to open through the texture of the film.

A sudden *tap* came from the door.

He froze, heart pounding in his ears. The knock came again, softer this time, like fingertips brushing wood.

Jonathan turned off the enlarger, plunged the room into darkness, and waited. The silence was so complete he could hear the faint hiss of the chemicals cooling in their trays.

After what felt like a long time, he opened the door.

No one was there.

But sitting on the floor in the hallway was the old, dented film canister from the caf√©. Its lid was off, and inside was a single strip of film, coiled tightly.

Jonathan didn‚Äôt pick it up. He backed into the apartment, shut the door, and locked it twice.

The ventilation fan was still humming in the bathroom. He could hear it through the wall.

Only, when he went back to the darkroom, the fan wasn‚Äôt running at all.

# Chapter 9¬† The Final Exposure

Jonathan didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

He sat in the living room with the lights on, staring at the desk drawer where the camera sat under its scarf. Every so often, he would think he heard something in the building, a faint creak in the hallway, the sound of water running in pipes when no one lived in the unit above him. Once, there was a soft, deliberate knock somewhere far down the corridor, followed by silence so heavy it pressed on his ears.

At 3:17 a.m., the lights flickered.

Jonathan didn‚Äôt move. The flicker came again, but slower this time, each bulb dimming almost to black before humming back to life. And with each pulse of darkness, he thought the air in the apartment shifted, as if the walls had inched closer.

The scarf in the drawer began to move.

It was subtle at first, a tiny ripple like a breeze had passed through the wood. Then it began to slide aside, revealing the old black camera. The lens glinted in the low light, catching him like an unblinking eye.

Jonathan‚Äôs skin went cold.

He stood, went to the drawer, and lifted the camera out. It felt heavier than it should have, as though something was inside it, waiting.

For a long time, he just stood there, breathing hard. Then he raised it to his eye.

The viewfinder was pitch black. No living room, no walls, nothing,¬† just a void. And yet, faintly, from somewhere impossibly far away, he thought he could see movement.

He took the picture.

The *click* rang out like a gunshot, followed by a deep, low sound that might have been in his head or might have been coming from inside the camera.

The instant the shutter closed, the apartment went dark.

Jonathan stumbled toward the bathroom, using the glow of his phone to set up the developing trays. His hands were shaking so badly the chemicals sloshed onto the tile. He worked quickly, not daring to stop, needing to see what was on the film.

As the image began to emerge, he realized it wasn‚Äôt his apartment at all. It was somewhere else,¬† a cavernous place with no walls or ceiling, just infinite black space stretching in every direction.

And in that space, impossibly far and yet horrifyingly close, was something massive. Its form was vague, shifting like smoke, but there were shapes within it,¬† arcs, curves, and jagged lines that might have been limbs or wings or both.

At its center was an opening, a circle of absolute darkness. And in the grain of the photograph, Jonathan could see the woman in green standing at its edge, one hand outstretched, beckoning.

Behind her, lined in a wide arc, were figures in black robes. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. All of them facing him.

Jonathan‚Äôs breath quickened. The edges of the photograph began to curl, the paper softening as if it were rotting in his hands.

The knocking started again. Not at the door this time, but from inside the walls. A steady, patient rhythm, as though something was searching for a way through.

The photograph grew warm. The woman‚Äôs hand in the image moved, just slightly, her fingers curling in a slow, unmistakable gesture.

Jonathan dropped it into the tray. The paper sank beneath the surface, but instead of floating back up, it kept sinking,¬† deeper and deeper into the developer, until it was gone.

The knocking stopped.

Somewhere in the apartment, the camera clicked by itself.

# Epilogue¬† Through the Frame

The click echoed in the dark.

Jonathan turned slowly toward the sound. The drawer was open again, the scarf gone, the camera sitting upright on the floor, lens pointed at him.

It fired a second time.

Only this time, the flash wasn‚Äôt light; it was darkness. A solid wave of black that rolled outward from the camera, swallowing the lamp, the walls, the floor. The smell of chemicals and damp film filled the air until it was choking.

Jonathan staggered back, his heel catching on the carpet, but there was nowhere to retreat to. The apartment was gone.

He was standing in the place from the photograph.

It was endless. The ground was a colorless void, like walking on the surface of a shadow. The air was thick, heavy, humming with a low vibration that made his bones ache.

The figures were there, just as they had been in the image. A ring of robed shapes, faces hidden, all turned toward him. None of them moved, but he felt their attention pressing into his skull, reading the space behind his eyes.

The woman in green stepped forward. Her dress swayed as if in some unfelt wind. In one hand, she held the old camera. The other she extended toward him, palm up.

Jonathan tried to speak, but his voice was swallowed before it left his throat.

Something moved above them.

It was vast, so large he could only comprehend pieces of it at a time,¬† a curve of glistening black, a web of tendons like stretched film strips, a cluster of unblinking eyes that seemed to open and close across its surface. Every time he looked directly at it, the shape changed, but the sensation of its enormity never faded.

The robed figures began to chant.

It wasn‚Äôt words,¬† more like the sound of film spooling, of shutters snapping, of old projectors rattling in dusty rooms. The vibrations grew stronger, shaking the ground beneath Jonathan‚Äôs feet.

The woman in green pressed the camera into his hands.

Her touch was cold.

Jonathan looked through the viewfinder and saw not the void, not the cult, not the thing above,¬† but his apartment again. It was empty, lights still on, the door ajar.

He hesitated.

The woman tilted her head, smiling faintly. Above them, the massive shape leaned closer. A single eye, the size of a doorway, opened and fixed on him.

Jonathan raised the camera and took the picture.

The door opened.

Something stepped through.

# Postscript¬† Untitled, Undated

The photograph is old. The edges are cracked, curling inward, and the surface is coated with a faint, greasy sheen that never dries.

No one remembers how it came into the archive. There‚Äôs no label, no record of its donation. It just appeared one morning in the tray with the other recent acquisitions, as though it had always been there.

At first glance, it‚Äôs an empty room.

A small apartment, lights on, cheap furniture, the faint blur of motion caught in the corner, maybe someone leaving as the shutter snapped. But the longer you look, the harder it is to tell if the room is truly empty.

There‚Äôs something wrong with the far wall. The pattern of the paint is warped, like heat rising from asphalt. Shapes seem to shift beneath it, too quick to name, as though something on the other side is pressing against it.

Some viewers say they can see a woman in a long green coat standing near the door. Others insist there‚Äôs no one there at all.

The archivist keeps it in a sealed envelope now, face down, in a locked drawer. He doesn‚Äôt remember doing that, but he doesn‚Äôt remember taking the picture either.

Sometimes, late at night, he hears the faint *click* of a shutter from inside the drawer.

And he did so in a scathing email, tearing me down to shreds, shaming me for some of my deepest insecurities, with so many open ended accusations and no room for me to respond or defend myself. So, here‚Äôs my response, the one that I had wrote out just for me, but, since he has me blocked anyway, I feel like my story deserves to live out in the world too, along with the story of us that I hope to preserve‚Ä¶

‚ÄúA,

There‚Äôs a lot I could say in response to your email, but nothing that would truly resolve how you‚Äôre feeling. That‚Äôs something I always struggled to come to terms with, that I never had the power to fix it for you. Sometimes you even demanded it of me, to take responsibility for your emotions, and that played perfectly into my nature. I always wanted to be able to heal the hurt, but it was never my job or within my capabilities. I hope that writing that email was cathartic for you; it seemed like something you needed to do for yourself. You deserve to be able to name the hurt, as do I. Because this wasn‚Äôt as one sided as you‚Äôre choosing to make it sound.

I‚Äôll start by saying I know that you‚Äôre not a liar, since it seems paramount for you to hear. I have no idea what happened in the session you had with our therapist, but if I had the opportunity to speak up for myself, you‚Äôd know it‚Äôs the truth. 

I hear you when say you felt abused by me, and I believe you. I don‚Äôt need to understand every nuance of your story to recognize that something in our relationship caused you pain. You didn‚Äôt deserve it, and you don‚Äôt deserve to be holding it now. Whatever I was struggling with at the time should have never spilled out in a way that left you hurting. I never wanted to hurt you, but I know that hurt was felt. I resented things I didn‚Äôt know how to talk about and let them fester. I take responsibility for that and the ways it made me act towards you. 

At the same time, you didn‚Äôt hear me. My repeated requests for you to stop went overshadowed by your drive to feed the anger and explode. A cornered animal fights back, and that‚Äôs where I was. And I don‚Äôt want you getting off without being able to take responsibility for your part. But you will, because here we are. 

You didn‚Äôt deserve to feel so unseen, and I didn‚Äôt deserve to feel so unheard, but we did. And I think that we both did the best we could with what we had. When we were hurting, we got messy, unfiltered, and acted as a mirror for one another other. We so badly wanted to feel safe in each other while holding the weight of our past, but it turned out that the relationship wasn‚Äôt strong enough to hold it all and needed to end. That doesn‚Äôt mean it was wrong or bad, just that we reached the end of what we could do together.

I know you don‚Äôt want to hear this, or even believe me, but despite everything, I really did love you. I loved us together. I loved calling you my person, coming home to you and feeding the cats, watching stuff on TV together, going to shows, out to dinner. You were my life, and you meant everything to me. You were the motivation for me to keep pushing forward and do better. There were times that I let my own shit get in the way of loving you, meeting you where you were at, showing up in ways that you needed me to. And it manifested in ways that I‚Äôm not proud of. But, I can also recognize how you did the same thing to me, and just how badly we needed to end it. We were really good sometimes and absolute fucking kryptonite other times. Your attachments and mine clashed, our coping mechanisms clashed, our patterns clashed. It was like a pressure cooker. God, there were times I hated you so much that I couldn‚Äôt even stand to look at you, and other times where I would catch a glimpse of your smile or hear you laugh and it made me fall in love with you all over again. It was like the worst roller coaster ride that I desperately wanted to get off of, but stayed on anyway because I wanted to convince myself that it could be fun. And, at times, it really fucking was. 

Loving someone is a huge risk. We expose ourselves and the most vulnerable parts, the softest sides and sharpest edges, leaving everything wide open and exposed. Despite the best intentions, how much effort, how much love, how much time and energy and emotion - there‚Äôs still risk of getting hurt. But I‚Äôm really fucking grateful that we took the risk together. You said it yourself, ‚ÄúWe may not have been for each other, but we were always there for each other‚Äù. I cried when I read that because I knew it was true, and it was really painful for me to hold that truth because I wanted us to work. I was so deep in denial because I wanted it so fucking bad. I‚Äôm sorry that my vision of us kept you in it, or that you felt kept in it, and I guess I‚Äôm glad that you were able to get out. I can tell that it‚Äôs still on your mind, seemingly just as much as it is on mine. We‚Äôll get both over it, eventually‚Ä¶and individually. 

I find myself reminiscing on the earlier days a lot, scrolling through old pictures, videos, messages, thinking about how much has changed, even just since October when we had our final voice lesson together. It could be that it was always this festering, bubbling mess underneath the surface, but parts of it were so beautiful, I can‚Äôt just let them go. I cherish them even now, through the harshest words you‚Äôve shared with me. I remind myself that your anger is taking the forefront right now, and that it‚Äôs okay. Because I got the chance to live and love with you, even if just for a little bit. With the exception of some of the uglier parts at the end, I wouldn‚Äôt erase any of it for the world. 

Somewhere in me, I still carry that version of you who loved me. Who held me at the Death Cab concert when I cried, who played Misty for me at Helsinki Open Mic night, who spontaneously found the darkest field in Hudson to park his car in so we could watch the meteor shower, who met up with a voice student for coffee at HiLo before the matinee performance of the Last Five Years (what a wildly poetic way to start off this relationship‚Ä¶). Thank you for these moments, A, because they really do mean the world to me. I‚Äôll always look back on them fondly, I just wish they weren‚Äôt so bittersweet now. 

Grief is the same no matter how it‚Äôs sliced up: we  always want just a little bit more time. I‚Äôll always want the opportunity to reminisce on the best parts with you, but that type of closure doesn‚Äôt seem to be in the cards for me. 

I‚Äôm not rewriting anyone‚Äôs story, just marking down my favorite parts so I can revisit them later, now that the book is over. I see the pain, the love, and the ending, and I can forgive it all.

Good luck. I hope that you get to do great things and that you‚Äôre happy.‚Äù",2,1755217143.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Like, on one hand you‚Äôve got Amazon ‚Äî the fast-shipping, return-anything, I-need-it-tomorrow powerhouse.  
But then‚Ä¶ AliExpress hits you with those *ridiculous* prices that make you question if you‚Äôve been overpaying your whole life.  
And somehow‚Ä¶ things arrive from halfway across the world for less than what I pay for coffee. HOW?  

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been comparing them:  

- **Shipping Speed**  
Amazon: Same-day or next-day. Boom, done.  
AliExpress: Two-to-six weeks sometimes‚Ä¶ unless you pay extra. Feels like forever.  

- **Price**  
Amazon: Competitive, but rarely rock-bottom.  
AliExpress: You can find stuff so cheap it feels illegal.  

- **Quality Control**  
Amazon: Consistent, plus easy returns.  
AliExpress: A bit of ‚Äúhit or miss‚Äù magic. Could be exactly what you ordered‚Ä¶ or a funny story you tell for months.  

- **Product Variety**  
Amazon: All the big brands, recognizable items.  
AliExpress: Weird, hyper-specific things you didn‚Äôt know existed but suddenly *need*.  

And here‚Äôs where it gets tricky:  
Do you wait longer to save big?

1mqhy7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1mqhy7y/from_love_to_betrayal_to_the_end_of_me/,From love to betrayal to the end of me,"I met my ex through my elder sister. They bonded over painting. She was beyond beautiful, and seemed emotionally aware, but I never approached her because she already had a boyfriend. Secretly, I liked her.

About a year later, I learned she had been cheated on. I didn‚Äôt want to take advantage of that, but a friend of mine texted her from my account. She replied, and I ended up carrying the conversation. We hit it off fast, talked for four or five days straight, and then she told me she was in love with me. I felt the same and told her.

She was in another state then, and within a day or two, she said she didn‚Äôt want to continue. I let her go. But she came back. And then left again. And came back. This cycle of pulling me close and then abandoning me repeated for over a year, more than 50 times.

I grew attached despite the chaos. Then came the moment that still makes me sick to my stomach. She insisted I finish inside her or she would leave me. She got pregnant despite having a contraceptive. She went back to her parents, thousands of kilometres away. I travelled to be with her, made sure she had everything she needed, and asked if she wanted to keep the child. She said no.

When I saw the ultrasound, my child, a tiny blue dot, I trembled. We both cried. That same evening, she went drinking at a friend‚Äôs wedding. I didn‚Äôt know a soul in that city, and it broke me in a way I can‚Äôt describe. The next day she took the abortion pills. I stayed, thinking maybe her mood swings and abuse were just hormones. I cried alone.

She would scream at me if I cried. She hinted at being with other men, then claimed it was just ‚Äúfuture possibilities‚Äù and that she wasn‚Äôt sure of her desires. My only request was that if she wanted that life, she should leave me. But she wouldn‚Äôt. Somehow she convinced me she loved me, even though I could see secrecy in her eyes.

She joined a reputed science institute for her PhD. My insecurity grew. We fought a lot. I still visited her, sent her food, stayed up until midnight every night so I could talk to her after her work was done.

On a trip to the mountains, I later found out she had gone drinking with a guy at midnight without telling me. I stayed silent at first, but when I confronted her later, she exploded, insisting nothing happened.

Then, one day, she confessed she had cheated on me with someone else and said she did it because I assumed she would. I wanted to die that day. She called it a mistake, begged to stay together. I asked her to cut contact with him, but she lied and kept meeting him. She even abused me for making it my fault.

I created a fake account. She ended up sexting me from that account, not knowing it was me, and admitted she had cheated with that guy three times. She even fell in love with my fake profile.

I cut her off. Months later, she called. I confronted her, she denied everything, claiming she had made it all up for the fake profile.

More months passed. I was still weak and still loved her. We got back together. During this time, she berated me for ‚Äúghosting‚Äù her and said I had emotionally exploited her by talking to her from the fake account,because apparently she had been in love with that fake account, having even confessed ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to it.

From August to April, I visited her five times. But by January, something shifted. Calls went unanswered. Texts were late. She claimed she was doing experiments when I knew she was pulling away.

Then she confessed she had developed mutual feelings for another guy. She said she loved me but wouldn‚Äôt stop talking to him. I stayed quiet, trying to see how far things had gone.

When I visited her later, she fell asleep and I saw her phone. All texts with him were deleted. I later logged into her Instagram and saw the truth. I miss you. Meet me for coffee. Flirty song links. She texted him first.

I wanted to walk away, but she kept repeating her party and late night routine. One night, she said she was in the lab. I said I didn‚Äôt believe her. She screamed at me for not trusting her and blocked me.

I took three sleeping pills that night. I survived. I blocked her.

A month later, she called from another number to tell me she was now in a relationship with that guy and again, somehow, it was my fault. I blocked her again.

Three months later, she called crying. Things with her new boyfriend weren‚Äôt going well. I was kind at first, until she started abusing me again. That was it.

Through all of this, the gaslighting, the emotional torture, the betrayal, I never once cheated on her. Not emotionally, not physically. I stayed loyal, even when it broke me.

I used to believe in karma. Now I‚Äôm not so sure.

I feel anxious all the time. I feel the withdrawal. I am on medicines. I only ever loved her, I guess, but I still don‚Äôt know why she hated me enough to destroy me for a lifetime. I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. That is what she left me with.

**Multiple Brew Size Options:** Select from single-serve cups to full carafes.

Carafe brewing capacities usually range from 10 to 12 cups, perfect for households or offices with multiple coffee drinkers. This versatility makes them ideal for both individual enjoyment and entertaining guests.

**Strength Control:** Adjust the brew strength to your liking.for true coffee aficionados, the ability to control brew strength is essential. Many coffee pot k-cup combos offer a ""bold"" or ""strong brew"" setting, which slows down the brewing process, allowing for a more complete extraction of flavor from the coffee grounds. This feature is particularly useful for those who prefer a richer, more intense coffee flavor. Some machines even allow you to fine-tune the brewing temperature, further enhancing control over the final product.

**Removable Water Reservoir:** Easy to fill and clean.

A removable water reservoir is a crucial convenience feature that simplifies both filling and cleaning. These reservoirs typically have a generous capacity, minimizing the need for frequent refills. The removable design allows you to easily carry the reservoir to the sink for refilling and cleaning,preventing spills and ensuring proper hygiene. A clear water level indicator is also a common feature, allowing you to easily monitor the water level and avoid overfilling.

**Pause and Serve Function:** Allows you to pour a cup mid-brew.

This function is a lifesaver when you can't wait for the entire pot to brew. The pause and serve feature temporarily halts the brewing process, allowing you to pour a cup without making a mess. Once you've poured your cup, simply replace the carafe, and the brewing process will automatically resume. This is an especially useful feature for those who are constantly on the go or who need a quick caffeine fix before the entire pot is finished.

## Core Benefits

The advantages of owning a coffee pot k-cup combo extend beyond simple convenience. They offer a range of practical benefits that cater to diverse lifestyles.

**Versatile Brewing Options:** Enjoy single-serve convenience or brew a full pot for a group.The primary benefit is undeniable versatility.The ability to switch seamlessly between single-serve and carafe brewing caters to individual preferences and varying needs. Whether you're the only coffee drinker in the household or regularly host large gatherings, this flexibility ensures you're always prepared. No need for multiple coffee makers cluttering your counter space.

**Cost-Effective Solution:** Reduces the need for multiple coffee makers.

Investing in a combo machine can be a surprisingly cost-effective solution. Instead of purchasing separate single-serve and drip coffee makers, you get both functionalities in one appliance. This saves you money on initial purchase costs, and also electricity usage, reducing your overall carbon footprint.Furthermore, brewing larger pots provides a more economical option than single-serve pods for regular coffee consumption.

**time-Saving Convenience:** Streamlines your morning routine with programmable features.

The programmable features of many combo coffee makers are designed to save you precious time in the morning. Setting the timer the night before means you can wake up to a freshly brewed pot of coffee, ready to jumpstart your day. The single-serve option also offers unparalleled convenience,allowing you to quickly brew a cup and be on your way in minutes. this streamlining of your morning routine can significantly reduce stress and improve overall productivity.

**Space-Saving Design:** Consolidates two appliances into one compact unit.

Counter space is often a premium in kitchens, and the coffee pot k-cup combo addresses this concern admirably. By combining two separate appliances into a single,compact unit,it frees up valuable counter space for other essential kitchen tasks. This is particularly beneficial for those living in apartments or homes with limited counter space.

**Reduced Waste:** Offers reusable filter options for eco-conscious consumers.

While k-cups offer convenience, they can also contribute to environmental waste. Though, many coffee pot k-cup combos offer reusable k-cup filters, allowing you to use your own ground coffee in the single-serve function. this reduces the amount of plastic waste generated by single-use pods, making it a more eco-conscious choice. Additionally, brewing larger pots in the traditional manner is inherently less wasteful than using individual pods.

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about the functionality and suitability of coffee pot k-cup combos before making a purchase.

**How often should I clean my coffee pot K-Cup combo?**

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining optimal performance and prolonging the lifespan of your coffee maker. It is indeed recommended to clean the machine at least once a month, or more frequently if you notice mineral buildup or a decline in coffee quality. The self-cleaning function, if available, can simplify this process.

**What type of filter does the carafe brewer use?**

Most models use standard paper filters, typically cone-shaped or basket-shaped, depending on the design of the carafe holder. Some machines may also offer a permanent, reusable filter, which can save you money in the long run and reduce waste. Check the product specifications for the filter type required.

**Is it possible to brew both a pot of coffee and a K-Cup simultaneously?**

No, typically these combo machines do not offer the ability to brew a pot of coffee and a K-Cup simultaneously. The brewing mechanisms are separate and require alternating usage.Brewing one function must be completed before initiating brewing with the other.

I remembered that I worshipped him like a god. He made me laugh and I felt shiny and new in his presence. Everyone loved him. He seemed so cool.
He buys me expensive gifts and tells me how lovely I am.


My life was a disaster zone and he felt like warmth 
In a subzero tundra. I clung to him for life. My very own Edward Cullin. 

Hes like.. perfection.  He told me all about his adventures, the degrees, the money, the black belts in martial arts. He told me about magic. It's too good to be true. I was vulnerable, I needed to believe to survive. 

He bought me a $1600 hotel. He told me he loved me. 
That I was his soul mate. That I was going to be his wife and that everything would be okay if I was by his side. That he would make all the bad things go away and he would lift me up out of the pain I was in.

 That I belonged to him. 

I was nervous to be intimate. How could I possibly be good enough? What does a woman do to provide enough for someone who has made so many lovely promises. I belonged to him now.. like a princess story book

Right?

 I didn't know that he lied to me about everything, even about his stories of his misjevious childhood dog were fabricated. Everything, a lie. 

He seemed maybe gentle for the first
... 2 seconds. A darkness in his eyes suddenly seemed unrecognizable. 

And then I found myself gritting my teeth. 
I told him he was hurting me but he grabbed my arms and twisted them. I cried hysterically. Praying to God to make it stop. I eventually gave up.  Please God, please make it stop God.

 I think it went on for an hour. Was it two hours? He twisted my body in different positions. Did he stop when I passed out? Fucking my lifeless, tear stained body. I don't think he did. 

I woke up and he offered me coffee. My mind developed a protective shell around the memory. I was Dissociative. 
But he loved me? I belong to him? 

I couldn't speak. 

 I have been wondering through earth absolutely lost. This is a damage I can seem to repair 

Beware of monsters disguised as men. Let the little girls know that the price charming will come for you while you are in your sweetest dreams and rape you just because they can. 
Beware Monsters dresses in human skin and clothing,
who steal souls.

1mqhq09,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mqhq09/can_i_fight_this_write_up/,Can I fight this write up?,"I work part time at a retail store and have been working there about a year. Not to toot my own horn but I‚Äôm a great employee. I show up on time every time. Rarely call in sick. Put in 100% every shift and am always friendly with customers. I‚Äôve only gotten in trouble at the job once when I forgot to give a lady her change right when I started working there. 

I worked at a restaurant a few years ago and ended up quitting for a bunch of reasons but a big one was that one of my coworkers was starting to harass me and management refused to do anything about it. The guy had a crush on me and didn‚Äôt take it well when I turned him down and started to make my life a living hell. This guy would do things like bump into while I was holding hot plates/coffee, refused to help when asked or cooperate when needed. Was calling me a white in another language he didn‚Äôt even speak (our other coworker taught him the word and a different coworker who spoke the same language let me know what was going on) and also told all our coworkers that I broke his heart which prompted them all to harass me about giving him another chance. 

Anyways I mention all this to say that he came into the store last week. We made eye contact and he started walking towards me so I quickly told my manager about the situation and he let me step out to the break room until he left. Anyways yesterday I ended up getting called into the store manager‚Äôs office and she showed me a scathing review about me. The review said that I was extremely rude when doing a return and that I apparently said that the item stunk of BO and that I essentially threw the item back at the customer after refusing to return. This literally never happened. I have NEVER acted that way with a customer no matter how frustrated I‚Äôve been. There are actually a few 4-5 star reviews on the google page saying that I was very friendly and helpful. Then I noticed the name and photo attached to the review. Idiot didn‚Äôt even bother making fake account. 

My manager told me she had to give me a write up for this and I told her who he was and his motives behind writing this. I also told her that she could ask my department manager to confirm that I wasn‚Äôt even on the floor when the guy was in the store and to even check the camera too if they needed. She basically told me it doesn‚Äôt matter because regardless it makes the company look bad (???). My department manager who was there, is unfortunately now on a backpacking trip for just about a month so he‚Äôs not even able to stand up for me on this at the moment. 

I‚Äôm really upset honestly. This guy already ruined one job for me and 3 years later‚Ä¶ you guys‚Ä¶ 3 YEARS LATER he‚Äôs still trying to ruin shit for me. WE NEVER EVEN WENT OUT. And I‚Äôm so upset that my manager won‚Äôt even look into the issue before writing me up. I feel like there‚Äôs more than enough proof that this didn‚Äôt happen. His name and a picture of his face were attached to the review and I had some old silly selfies that we had taken before he turned into a weirdo that I just never got around to deleting (I‚Äôm a photo hoarder what can I say) and showed her to prove that we actually do know each other. She said it didn‚Äôt matter and that all reviews have to be considered equally. 

I refused to accept the write up which has resulted in me being removed from the schedule until the next pay period and she sent me home early. The beginning of the pay period just started so I‚Äôm essentially making $0 for the next two weeks. This all happened within the first hour of my shift so legally she has to pay me for at least 4 but wtf. 90 bucks isn‚Äôt enough to last two weeks. If this had actually happened then I would understand but it literally didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt understand how I can be punished for something that I didn‚Äôt even do or the fact that she‚Äôs refusing to investigate it or whatever. 

I‚Äôm thinking about making a formal complaint to HR about it. I did everything right to avoid an altercation with him and I‚Äôm still being punished. If anyone has additional advice about how to approach this with HR or if I should even bother it would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm just part time in retail so there‚Äôs no union to get advice from either. ",1,1755216107.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

¬†  
  
¬† Sorry about that. 1 The way the Glass House worked, on a practical level, was that there was a schedule for the stuff that had to be done--cooking, cleaning, fixing things, laundry. Technically, they were all on every housemate's list. In practice, though, what happened was this: the boys (Michael and Shane) bribed the girls (Eve and Claire) to do the laundry, and the girls bribed the boys to fix things. Claire glared at her new iPod--which was actually really nice--and put it on shuffle as she looked at the mess she'd made of her latest laundry effort. And there was the problem: she loved the hot pink iPod, which had been a heck of a good bribe, and she really didn't deserve it, because the laundry was . . . also pink--which would have been almost fine if it had been a load full of girls' underwear or something. But not so much with guy clothes; she could not even imagine what kind of screaming that was going to bring.  
  
¬† ""Yeah. "" She sighed, staring at the very definitely pink piles of shirts, socks, and underwear. ""Not going to be a good afternoon. "" It was amazing what one--one--stupid red sock could do. She'd already tried running it all through the washer again, hoping the problem would just go away. No such luck. The basement of the Glass House was big, dark, and creepy, which wasn't really such a surprise. Most basements were, and this was Morganville. Morganville went in for dark and creepy the way Las Vegas went in for neon. Apart from the area Claire was in, with a battered washer and dryer, a table that had once been painted some kind of industrial green, and some shelves filled with unidentifiable junk, the rest of the basement was dim and quiet. Hence the iPod, which pumped cheery music through the headphones and made the creepy retreat a little less creepy. Creepy, she could fight. Pink underwear . . . apparently not.  
  
¬† She had the music cranked up so high that she failed to hear steps coming down the stairs. In fact, she had no clue she wasn't completely alone until she felt a hand touch her shoulder and hot breath against her neck. She reacted as any sensible person living in a town full of vampires would. She screamed. The shriek echoed off the brick and concrete, and Claire whirled, clapped her hands over her mouth, and backed away from Eve, who was collapsing in laughter. The Goth look usually didn't go well with hysterical giggles, unless they were evil giggles, but somehow Eve managed to pull it off. Claire ripped the headphones out of her ears and gasped. ""You--you--""  
  
¬† ""Oh, spit it out already,"" Eve managed to say. ""Bitch. I am. I know. That was evil. But, oh my God, funny. ""  
  
¬† ""Bitch,"" Claire said, late and not at all meaning it. ""You scared me. ""  
  
¬† ""Kind of the point,"" Eve said, and got herself under control. Her mascara was a little smeared, but Claire supposed that was all part of the Goth thing, anyway. ""So, what's up, pup?""  
  
¬† ""Trouble,"" Claire replied with a sigh. Her heart was still pounding from the scare, but she was determined not to let it show. She pointed at the laundry on the table. Eve's eyes went wide, and her black-painted lips parted in horrified fascination. ""That's not trouble; that's fail. Tell me that isn't all the whites. Like, Michael's and Shane's, too. ""  
  
¬† ""All the whites,"" Claire said, and held up the guilty red sock. ""Yours?""  
  
¬† ""Oh, damn. "" Eve snatched it out of Claire's fingers and shook the sock like a floppy rattle. ""Bad sock! Bad! You are never going anywhere fun ever again!""  
  
¬† ""I'm serious. They're going to kill me. ""  
  
¬† ""They'll never get the chance. I'm going to kill you. Do I look to you like someone who rocks pastel?"" Well, that was a definite point. ""Sorry,"" Claire said. ""Seriously. I tried washing them again, without the sock, but--"" Eve shook her head, reached down to the lowest level of the shelf, and pulled out a bottle of bleach, which she thumped down on the table next to the laundry. ""You bleach; I'll supervise, because I'm not taking the chance of getting a drop on this outfit, \`k? It's new. "" The outfit in question was hot pink--it matched Claire's new iPod, actually--with (of course) black horizontally striped tights, a black pleated miniskirt, and a blazing magenta top with a skull all blinged out in crystal on it. Eve had done up her dyed black hair in a messy pile on top of her head, with stray bits sticking up in all directions. She looked creepy/adorable. As Claire reloaded the laundry, with a shot of bleach, Eve climbed up on the dryer and kicked her feet idly. ""So, you heard the news, right?""  
  
¬† ""What news?"" Claire asked. ""Do I do hot? Is hot good?""  
  
¬† ""Hot is good,"" Eve confirmed. ""Michael got another call from that music producer guy. You know, the one from Dallas? The important one, with the daughter at school here. He wants to set Michael up with some club dates in Dallas and a couple of days at a recording studio. I think he's serious. "" Eve was trying to sound excited about it, but Claire could follow the road signs. Sign one (shaped like an Exit sign): Michael Glass was Eve's serious, longtime crush/boyfriend. Sign two (DANGER, CURVES): Michael Glass was hot, talented, and sweet. Sign three (yellow, CAUTION): Michael Glass was a vampire, which made everything a million times more complicated.  
  
¬† Sign four (flashing red): Michael had begun acting more like a vampire than the boy Eve loved, and they'd already had some pretty spectacular fights about it--so bad, in fact, that Claire was not sure Eve wasn't thinking about breaking up with him. All of which led to sign five (STOP). ""You think he'll go?"" Claire asked, and concentrated on setting the right temperature on the washer.  
  
¬† The smell of the detergent and bleach was kind of pleasant, like really sharp flowers, the kind that would cut you if you tried to pick them. ""To Dallas, I mean?""  
  
¬† ""I guess. "" Eve sounded even less enthusiastic. ""I mean, it's good for him, right? He can't just hang around playing at coffee shops in Jugular, Texas. He needs to . . . "" Her voice faded out, and she looked down at her lap with a focus Claire thought the skirt really didn't deserve. ""He needs to be out there. ""  
  
¬† ""Hey,"" Claire said, and as the washer began chugging away, washing away the stains, she put her hands on Eve's knees. The kicking stopped, but Eve didn't look up. ""Are you guys breaking up?"" Eve still didn't look up. ""I cry all the time,"" she said. ""I hate this. I don't want to lose him. But it's like he just keeps getting farther and farther away, you know? And I don't know how he feels. What he feels. If he feels. It's awful. "" Claire swallowed hard. ""I think he still loves you. "" Now she got Eve to look at her--big, vulnerable dark eyes rimmed by all the black. ""Really? Because . . . I just . . . "" Eve took a deep breath and shook her head. ""I don't want to get dumped. It's going to hurt so bad, and I'm so scared he'll find somebody else. Somebody, you know, better. ""  
  
¬† ""Well, that's not going to happen,"" Claire said. ""Not ever. ""  
  
¬† ""Easy for you to say. You haven't seen how the girls throw themselves at him after shows. ""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, you'd never do that. "" Eve looked up sharply, smiled a little, then looked back down. ""Yeah, okay, whatever. But it's different when he's my Michael and they're the ones who are all, you know . . . Anyway, he's just always so nice to them. "" Claire jumped up next to her on the dryer and kicked her feet in rhythm with Eve's. ""He has to be nice, right? That's his job, kind of. And we were talking about whether you guys were breaking up. Are you?""  
  
¬† ""I . . . don't know. It's weird right now. It hurts, and I want the hurt to be over, one way or another, you know?"" Eve's shoulders rose and fell in a shrug that somehow managed to be depressed at the same time. ""Besides, now he's running off to Dallas. They won't let me go, if he does. I'm just, you know. Human. ""  
  
¬† ""You've got one of the cool frat pins. Nobody would stop you. "" The cool frat pins were a gift from Amelie, the town's Founder, one of the most frighteningly quiet vampires Claire had ever met, and Claire's boss, technically. They worked like the bracelets most people in town wore, the ones that identified individuals or families as being Protected by a specific vampire, only these were better. . . . People who wore these pins didn't have to  
give blood or take orders. They weren't owned. As far as Claire knew, there were fewer than ten people in all of Morganville who had this kind of status, and it meant freedom--in theory--from a lot of the scarier elements of town. This was all because they'd gotten in over their heads, had to fight their way out of it, and done some good for Amelie in the process. It was heroism by accident, in Claire's opinion, but she definitely wasn't turning down the pin or what the pin represented. ""If they decide Michael can go, I'll still have to file an application for temporary leave,"" Eve said. ""So would you, or Shane, if you wanted to tag along. And they could turn us down. They probably would. ""  
  
¬† ""Why?""  
  
¬† ""Because they're mostly asshats? Not to mention bloodsucking vampire asshats, which doesn't exactly make them fair from the beginning. "" Claire could see her point, actually, which was depressing. The air filled with the smells of laundry, which was homey and didn't go too well with depressing. Claire remembered her iPod, which was still blaring away at her headphones, and clicked it off. They sat in silence for a while, and then Eve said, ""I wish the dryer were running, because man, I could use a good . . . tumble dry. "" Claire burst out laughing and, after a second, Eve joined her, and it was all okay. Even in the dark. Even in the basement. In the end, the laundry was only a little pink.

Chapter Two  
  
¬†  
  
¬† Dinner was taco night, and it was Claire's turn for that, too, which somehow seemed wrong, but she'd switched with Michael when she'd been staying late at the university library, so she was stuck with Chore Day. Not that she minded making tacos; she liked it, actually. Shane blew in the door just as she was chopping the last of the onions, which was typical Shane timing; five minutes earlier, and she'd have made him do the chopping. Instead, he arrived just as she was wiping tears away from her stinging eyes. Perfect. He didn't care that her eyes were red, apparently, because he kicked the kitchen door shut, slammed the dead bolt with a gesture so smooth it looked automatic, set a bag on the counter, and leaned over to kiss her. It was one of those hi-I'm-home kisses, not one of his really good ones, but it still made Claire's heart flutter a little bit in her chest. Shane looked . . . like Shane, she guessed, which was fine with her. Tall, broad, he had sun-streaked slacker hair and a heartbreaker's smile. He was wearing a Killers T-shirt that smelled like barbecue, from his job. ""Hey!"" she protested--not very sincerely--and waved the knife she'd been using to chop onions. ""I'm armed!""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, but you're not very dangerous,"" he said, and kissed her again, lightly. ""You taste like tacos. ""  
  
¬† ""You taste like barbecue. ""  
  
¬† ""And that's a win-win!"" He grinned at her, reached over, and rattled the paper bag he'd set on the counter. ""How about some brisket tacos?""  
  
¬† ""That is so wrong, you know. Brisket does not go in tacos. ""  
  
¬† ""Twisted, yet delicious. I say yes. "" Claire sighed and dumped the chopped onions into a bowl. ""Hand me the brisket. "" Secretly, she liked brisket tacos; she just liked giving him a hard time more. ""You know,"" Claire said as she got the barbecue out of the bag, ""you really ought to talk to Michael. ""  
  
¬† ""About what?""  
  
¬† ""What do you think? About what's going on with him and Eve!""  
  
¬† ""Oh hell no. Guys don't talk about that crap. ""  
  
¬† ""You're serious. ""  
  
¬† ""Really. ""  
  
¬† ""What do you talk about?"" Shane looked at her as if she were insane. ""You know. Stuff. We're not girls. We don't talk about our feelings. I mean, not to other guys. "" Claire rolled her eyes and said, ""Fine, be emotionally stunted losers; I don't care. ""  
  
¬† ""Good. Thanks. I'll do that. "" The door opened, and Michael shuffled in, rocking the worst bed head Claire had ever seen him with. ""Whoa. Dude, you look like crap. You getting enough iron in your diet?""  
  
¬† ""Screw you, and thanks. I just woke up. What's your excuse?""  
  
¬† ""I work for a living, man. Unlike the nightwalking dead. "" Michael went straight past them and from the refrigerator took a sports bottle, which he stuck in the microwave for fifteen seconds. Claire was grateful the smell of the onions, brisket, and taco meat covered the smell of what was in the bottle. Well, they all knew what it was, but if she pretended really hard, it didn't have to be quite as obvious. Michael drank from his sports bottle, then wandered over to look at what they were doing. ""Cool, tacos. How long?""  
  
¬† ""Depends on whether or not she lets me do the chopping,"" Shane said. ""Five minutes, maybe?"" The doorbell rang. ""I'll get it!"" Eve yelled, and there was something in her voice that really didn't sound quite right. More . . . desperate than eager, as if she wanted to stop them from getting to it first. Claire glanced over at Shane, and he raised his eyebrows. ""Uh-oh,"" he said. ""Either she's finally dumping you, Mikey, and her new boy's coming for dinner, or--"" It was the or, of course. After a short delay, Eve opened the swinging door just wide enough to stick her face inside. She tried for a smile. It almost worked. ""Uh--so I invited someone to dinner,""  
  
¬† ""Nice time to tell us,"" Shane said. ""Shut up. You've got enough food for the Fifth Armored Division and all of us. We can fill one more plate. "" But she was having trouble keeping eye contact, and as Claire watched, Eve bit her lip and looked away completely. ""Crap,"" Michael said. ""I'm not going to like this, am I? Who is it?"" Eve silently opened the door the rest of the way. Behind her, standing with his hands stuffed in the pockets of his jeans jacket, head down, was her brother, Jason Rosser. Jason looked--different, Claire thought. For one thing, he usually looked strung out and dirty and violent, and now he looked almost sober, and he was definitely on speaking terms with showers. Still skinny, and she couldn't say much for the baggy clothes he was wearing, but he looked . . . better than she'd ever seen him. And even so, something inside her flinched, hard, at the sight of him. Jason was associated with several of her worst, scariest memories, and even if he hadn't actually hurt her, he hadn't helped her, either--or any of the girls who'd been hurt, or killed. Jason was a bad, bad kid. He'd been an accomplice to at least three murders and to an attack on Claire. And neither Shane nor Michael had forgotten any of that. ""Get him out of here,"" Shane said in a low, dangerous-sounding tone. ""Now. ""  
  
¬† ""It's Michael's house,"" Eve said, without looking at any of them directly. ""Michael?""  
  
¬† ""Wait a second--it's our house! I live here, too!"" Shane shot back. ""You don't get to drag his low-life ass in here and act as if nothing happened with him!""  
  
¬† ""He's my brother! And he's trying, Shane. God, you can be such a--""  
  
¬† ""It's okay,"" Claire said. Her hands were shaking, and she felt cold, but she also saw Jason lift his head, and for a second their eyes met. It was like a physical shock, and she wasn't sure what she saw, or what he saw, but neither one of them could hold it for long. ""It's just dinner. It's not a big deal. "" Shane turned toward her, eyes wide, and put his hands on her shoulders. ""Claire, he hurt you. Hell, he hurt me, too! Jason is not some stray mutt you can take in and feed, okay? He's psycho. And she knows it better than anybody. "" He glared at Eve, who frowned but didn't glare back as she normally would have. ""You expect us all to just play nice with him now that he figures out the bad guys aren't winning, so he cranks out a quick apology? Because it's not happening. It's just not. ""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, I figured it would go this way. Sorry I bothered you,"" Jason said. His voice sounded faint and rusty, and he turned and walked away, toward the front door and out of their line of sight. Eve went after him, and she must have tried to stop him, because Claire heard his soft voice say, ""No, he's not wrong. I've got no right to be here. I did bad things, sis. This was a mistake. "" Of all of them, only Michael hadn't spoken--hadn't moved, in fact. He was staring at the swinging door as it swayed back and forth, and finally he took a deep breath, set down his sports bottle, and went out into the hallway. Claire smacked at Shane's arm. ""What the hell was that, macho man? You have to come to my rescue all the time, even when nobody's trying to hurt me?"" He seemed honestly surprised. ""I was just--""  
  
¬† ""I know what you were just doing. You don't speak for me!""  
  
¬† ""I wasn't trying to--""  
  
¬† ""Yes, you were. Look, I know Jason's no saint, but he got himself together, and he stuck with Eve when all of us were--out of commission, when Bishop was in charge. He protected her. ""  
  
¬† ""And he let his crazy buddy Dan grab you and almost kill you, and he didn't do anything!""  
  
¬† ""He did,"" Claire said flatly. ""He left me to find help. I know because Richard Morrell told me later. Jason went to the cops and tried to tell them. They didn't believe him or they'd have gotten help to me a lot earlier. "" Earlier would have meant a lot less terror and pain and despair. It wasn't Jason's fault that they'd figured him for crazy. Shane was thrown, a little, but he came back swinging. ""Yeah, well, what about those other girls? He didn't help them, did he? I'm not friending up somebody like that. ""  
  
¬† ""Nobody said you had to,"" Claire shot back. ""Jason's done his time in jail. Sitting at the same table isn't like swearing eternal brotherhood. "" He opened his mouth, closed it, and then said, very tightly, ""I just wanted to make sure he didn't have a chance to hurt you again. ""  
  
¬† ""Unless he uses a taco as a deadly weapon, he hasn't got much of a shot. Having you, Michael, and Eve here is about the best protection I could want. Anyway, would you rather have him where you can see him, or where you can't?"" Some of the fire faded out of his eyes. ""Oh. Yeah, okay. "" He st  
ill looked uncomfortable, though. ""You do crazy crap, you know. And it's contagious. ""  
  
¬† ""I know. "" She put her hand on his cheek, and got a very small smile in return. ""Thanks for wanting to keep me safe. But don't overdo it, okay?"" Shane made a sound of frustration deep in his throat, but he didn't argue. The kitchen door swung open again. It was Michael, looking fully awake and very calm, as if bracing for a fight. ""I talked to him,"" he said. ""He's sincere enough. But if you don't want him here, Shane--""  
  
¬† ""I damn sure don't,"" Shane said, then glanced at Claire and continued. ""But if she's willing to give it a shot, I will. "" Michael blinked, then raised his eyebrows. ""Huh,"" he said. ""The universe explodes, hell freezes, and Shane does something reasonable. "" Shane silently offered him the finger. Michael grinned and backed out of the kitchen again. Claire handed Shane the biggest knife they had. ""Chop brisket,"" she said. ""Take out your frustrations. "" The brisket didn't stand a chance.

Chapter Three  
  
¬†  
  
¬† Jason didn't say much at dinner. In fact, he was almost completely silent, though he ate four tacos as if he'd been starving for a month, and when Eve brought out ice cream for dessert, he ate a double helping of that, too. Shane was right. The brisket was delicious in the tacos. Eve, compensating for her brother, chattered like a magpie on crack the whole time--about dumb-asses at the coffee shop where she worked, Common Grounds; about Oliver, her vampire boss, who was a full-time jerk, as far as Claire was concerned, although apparently he was a surprisingly fair supervisor; gossip about people in town. Michael contributed some juicy stuff about the vampire side of town (Claire, for one, had never considered that vampires could fall in and out of love just like regular people--well, vampires other than Michael, and maybe Amelie. ) Shane finally loosened up on his glares and brought up some embarrassing stories from Michael's and Eve's pasts. If there were embarrassing stories he knew about Jason, he didn't get into telling them. It started out deeply uncomfortable, but by the time the ice cream bowls were empty, it felt kind of--normal. Not great--there was still a cautious tension around the table--but there was guarded acceptance. Jason finally said, ""Thanks for the food. "" They all stopped talking and looked at him, and he kept his own gaze down on the empty dessert bowl. ""Shane's right. I got no right to think I can just show up here and expect you not to hate my guts. You should. ""  
  
¬† ""Damn straight,"" Shane muttered. Claire and Eve both glared at him. ""What? Just sayin'. "" Jason didn't seem to mind. ""I needed to come and tell you that I'm sorry. It's been--things got weird, man. Real weird. And I got real screwed up, in all kinds of ways. Until that thing happened with Claire . . . Look, I never meant--she wasn't part of it. That was all on him. "" Him meant the other guy, the one none of them mentioned, ever. Claire felt her palms sweating and wiped them against her jeans. Her mouth felt dry. ""But I'm guilty of other stuff, and I confessed to all of it to the cops, and I did time for it. I never killed anybody, though. I just--wanted to be somebody who got respect. "" Michael said, ""That's how you think you get respect around here? As a killer?"" Jason looked up, and it was eerie, seeing eyes exactly like Eve's in such a different face, simmering with anger. ""Yeah,"" he said. ""I did. I still do. And I don't need a frigging vampire to set me straight about that, either. In Morganville, when you're not one of the sheep, and you're not one of the wolves, you'd better be one mean-ass junkyard dog. "" Claire glanced over at Shane and was surprised to see that he wasn't hopping on the angry train. In fact, he was looking at Jason as if he understood what he was saying. Maybe he did. Maybe it was a guy thing. Nobody spoke, and finally Jason said, ""So anyway, I just wanted to say thanks for helping get me out of jail. I'd be dead by now if you hadn't. I won't forget. "" He scraped his chair back and stood up. ""Thanks for the tacos. Dinner was real good. I haven't--I haven't sat at a table with people for a really long time. "" Then, without making eye contact with any of them, he walked away, down the hall. Eve jumped up and ran after him, but before she got to him, he was out the front door and slamming it behind him.

The most meaningful cups of coffee I‚Äôve had in my life were shared with the farmers who farmed and processed the coffee itself.¬†  
  
One big realization I had on this farm visit was that somehow coffee becomes more complex the further it gets from its source. In these mountains, life is slow. The Bugkalot people we met don‚Äôt drink coffee to fuel themselves for a workday. Neither do they drink coffee looking so intensely for flavor notes.¬†

She has been difficult since the minute I have found out who I was rooming with. I talked to her about sharing appliances(fridge, microwave, coffee maker) as long as we respect it. She refused, I understand that sharing can be a bit concerning. But then all of a sudden she started bragging about that she has all that stuff. Then I met up with her a couple of times since we only lived an hour away from each other. 
I like pink, shopping, reading, majoring in criminal justice. 
She likes Pok√©mon, reading, science, and majoring in some kind of science on a pre med track( I was confused when she fully explained it). 
At first I was all for a theme and trying to work something out to make the dorm cute and cozy but the closer we got to moving in she stoped texting me, leaving me on read for days, and insulting anything I suggested. For example, I shared a Pinterest board to get some ideas, any picture I shared she critiqued every piece of the photos, it got exhausting. 
She kept comparing everything we did, from classes we are taking, to perspectives on what we plan to do in college. One time I asked her what she thought about parties, I said I would definitely go to one and see what it‚Äôs like, and she said that she ‚Äúplans to graduate on time‚Äù then continues that she thinks it‚Äôs weird that I would ever want to rush for sorority. 
Fast forward to move in day. I get in while she was at a camp. I start to move in, go to krogers with my parents, get groceries, then come back and start organizing, when she walks in she rushes to her stuff, checks her safe, then says she is going to get a shower, I was a bit confused but ignored it and carried on. She came back in after taking a shower fully ignored us then let out a loud sigh and started complaining about all the classes that she has to take, saying because she has to take more than me, I just said ‚Äúoh my‚Äù the continued organizing. 
When my parents left I cried, it was rough for me, she kept watching me so I apologized for crying. She told me that her leaving her parents was worst then my experience( another time she was comparing us). 
Later that night I was exhausted so I got into bed, which is very high and challenging to get on and I just recently had surgery so I didn‚Äôt want to over due it, I told her this. She comes into the dorm, turns on the lights and starts talking loudly, I said oh I‚Äôm tired and have a headache, I said I hope she had a nice time out then I put the blanket over my head due to the lights and tried to go to bed. She kept talking to me then she asked me if she could use my microwave( before we came she said she was bringing a microwave). I agreed so she would just be done and I could try to sleep which I was blatantly trying to do. The microwave was acting up and asked me to come look at it, remind you I didn‚Äôt want to over do it with my surgery, she knew this.
I got down told her I‚Äôll see if I can have my dad look at it soon, she said she would ignore the loud sound that made it sound like it would explode and use it, I told her no. She was pissed about it. So I just told her to use my coffee machine to get the hot water she wanted( she said she was bringing a coffee machine). She complained about my coffee machine but grabbed one of my coffee cups to get her hot water, I asked her to fill the water up after she used it, so she grabbed one of my waters to fill it up!! I was mad, but I just wanted to go to bed, so I went to go back to bed and she kept talking and talking until she was tired. 
What do I do? I had to leave the following day because of some surgery problems and I‚Äôm scared about leaving her with my stuff.

It's been bothering me lately, and i feel like it's intensified and crossed the line. I'm mid-sentence and they let one rip. Talking about work stress? Rip. Drinking coffee together? Rip. Good morning hug? Rip. Dinner time? Rip with a side of Rip.

I really noticed it, and how often I've been interrupted or startled by it, about 2 weeks ago. Didn't say anything at first, 'wow, that was an annoying time to do that, maybe I'm just in a bad mood right now'.

Then about a week later, I made a passive comment: 'wow, is your belly okay? You've been extra farty lately'.

Slashing just 1 per cent of the red tape that is constraining Australian businesses could generate more than $1bn in economic growth, according to a Business Council of Australia report that calls for dozens of reforms to help cut the nation‚Äôs $110bn regulatory bill.

By Sarah Ison, Geoff Chambers

5 min. readView original

[Ahead of Jim Chalmers‚Äô economic reform roundtable](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/anthony-albanese-and-jim-chalmers-told-to-learn-from-victorias-earlyprevention-healthcare-approach/news-story/e1313dbc7e4793c313380c44df6ee1ec)¬†next week, the BCA has released a 65-page Better Regulation Report, which reveals the compliance burden borne from more than 80,000 pieces of regulation is now well over $110bn.

As the Treasurer signals the government is focused on cutting red tape across all levels of government to help speed up the clean energy transition and housing, the top priorities in the report sent to Treasury include reducing wait times for foreign investment approvals, establishing a single national payroll tax platform, and abolishing unnecessary tariffs.

‚ÄúRegulation and intervention have increasingly become the first resort of policy makers to deal with a perceived market failure, while cost-benefit assessments of new policies have either been bypassed or paid lip service by various governments,‚Äù the report states. ‚ÄúThe commonwealth government‚Äôs last regulatory stocktake in 2014 estimated there were around 86,000 regulations with a compliance burden of $65bn over a decade ago ‚Äì around 4.2¬†per cent of GDP. In today‚Äôs dollars, this represents a compliance burden of over $110bn ‚Äì before even accounting for any increase in regulation since.‚Äù

[In an effort to turbocharge](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/create-national-register-for-all-care-workers-says-productivity-commission/news-story/83eab6d0176e98a15f5a992c1d0ffd03)¬†measures that would cut red tape, Dr Chalmers last year launched a $900m fund to incentivise states and territories to take on pro-productivity reforms. Business leaders and the states believe the fund will need to be expanded.

In its submission to Treasury, the BCA revealed its members were reporting Australia was being carved out of global transactions because of delays and uncertainty facing foreign investors. And about 300 ‚Äúnuisance tariffs‚Äù applied to various imports were adding to international companies‚Äô compliance burden while generating just $13m in ¬≠revenue annually.

Concerns were also raised around the extra compliance burden fuelled by climate-related ¬≠financial disclosures, with the BCA warning costs associated with such disclosures could ¬≠average in their millions for companies over the next decade.

BCA chief executive Bran Black, who will attend the roundtable as a representative of the nation‚Äôs biggest employers, said: ‚ÄúWe have become too complex a country in which to do business, and that‚Äôs a massive handbrake on our ability to lift productivity and living standards.

‚ÄúWe have an opportunity to address excessive and duplicative rules that impose unnecessary costs on both businesses and consumers,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúIn Victoria, a cafe owner needs 36 separate licences and approvals before they can pour the first coffee, while a tradie on the Gold Coast needs to pay ¬≠hundreds of dollars in permits just¬†to fix a tap over the NSW ¬≠border. This is the regulation we need to fix.

‚ÄúRight now, our approvals system is holding back housing and renewable energy projects. If we‚Äôre serious about leaving Australia better off for the next generation, we need to make these sys¬≠tems fit for a modern economy.‚Äù

The Housing Industry Association on Friday will also call for the roundtable to declare war on ‚Äúred, white and green tape‚Äù.

‚ÄúFast-tracking housing approvals under a ‚Äòone house, one approval‚Äô approach, alongside clearing the significant backlog of projects stuck awaiting environmental approvals, could unlock hundreds of thousands of homes in one fell swoop (and) at the same time spur investment in housing and its multiplier effect on the economy,‚Äù HIA managing director Jocelyn Martin said.

‚ÄúPutting a pause on the churn of change to the NCC and WHS rules is another key area for reform. Inconsistent, duplicating and conflicting rules across these policy areas from different agencies continue to impose costs on regulated entities and mean more time in offices navigating red tape than on site building homes.‚Äù

Dr Chalmers said Labor already had ‚Äúa big agenda‚Äù to ease the burden on businesses and cut red tape but was ‚Äúkeen to do more where we responsibly can‚Äù.

‚ÄúBetter regulation will be a big focus of the economic reform roundtable,‚Äù Dr Chalmers said.

‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs our occupational licensing reforms, the Single Front Door for investment, our work on approvals, we‚Äôve made progress on regulatory reform but we recognise there‚Äôs more to do and we thank the Business Council for its ¬≠contribution.‚Äù

As a starting point to slashing red tape, the BCA called on Labor to appoint a standalone cabinet minister for better regulation with clear responsibility across departments to drive a better regulation agenda.

For businesses operating across different states and territories, there were eight separate payroll tax online platforms, which the BCA said desperately needed to be consolidated.

The 13 laws preventing discrimination were also complex and overlapped, as were the five different legal and professional standards determining whether an individual was considered a ‚Äúfit¬†and proper person‚Äù. In both areas, removing duplication and streamlining regulation would drastically reduce compliance for businesses, the BCA said.

Other changes called for include lifting the current exemption threshold for FBT minor benefits from $300 to $500, and for reporting thresholds from $2000 to $3000.

The BCA report reveals Australia‚Äôs cross-border trade system has more than 200 pieces of legislation and regulation, involving 32 agencies across government and operating across 20 business-facing trade portals.

‚ÄúDuplication is prevalent throughout the cross-border trading system, with a third of regulations duplicated in some ways across agencies, while more than half of the data provided to government by business is duplicated,‚Äù the report states.

‚ÄúOne large logistics company reported using around 360,000 pieces of paper each year for cross-border trade.‚Äù

The employer group recommends the government implements the creation of a single portal and fast-tracks legislation to boost confidence in paperless trade. Regulations around trade and foreign investment are of particular concern, given the AUKUS deal, which necessitates a high-level of business collaboration and technology sharing between countries.

Compared with other OECD countries, Australia is home to some of the most restrictive ¬≠foreign investment screening ¬≠regimes.

To address the ‚Äúenormous investment task‚Äù, the BCA has proposed a well-resourced ‚Äúsingle front door‚Äù for all new investment, as well as drastic improvements to the Foreign Investment Review Board.

Parenthood has been really challenging for me, and when I was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago I started to understand why I have struggled so much. 

My husband and I both grew up Mormon and we got married at 20. I was so uneasy about having kids and I wasn‚Äôt even sure I wanted to be a mom, but because of our religious background, we both believed that having a baby was what God wanted us to do and that He would provide. I got pregnant at 22 right as my husband was getting started into his career. 

My husband works in law enforcement. He adores his job and he‚Äôs really good at what he does and has quickly started to climb the ladder. The real kicker though is that his schedule alternates between him working 24 hours a week and then 60 the next, and every 10 weeks he changes between the day/night shift. It feels impossible to keep a good routine for me and my son. 

I hate being stuck at home and after being sick my entire pregnancy I entered postpartum where I spent an insane amount of hours alone with my baby including night shifts alone. It was really traumatizing for me and I felt so lied to by my church and by my community that acted like everything would be fine if I just did what God wanted. I found myself daydreaming of working outside the home as soon as I left the hospital. And it took me about two years to get over the resentment that I felt towards my husband for 1) impregnating me (granted it was consensual and he did not deserve my resentment), and 2) leaving me alone while he gets to pursue a career that he loves and enjoy a very social work environment. About six months ago I did get a very part-time job at a coffee shop where I work a couple times a week on my husband‚Äôs days off. 

On top of everything else I am a Type 1 Diabetic and pregnancy/motherhood only made managing my health harder. And my parents unexpectedly moved across the country when my son was 6 months old, so I lost all my immediate family‚Äôs support. 

I‚Äôm making this post because we still live in Utah with a dense Mormon population and I get comments constantly from family, friends, neighbors, even my husband‚Äôs coworkers and management asking when I‚Äôm going to have another baby. And I have two best friends with kids the same age as my son and they‚Äôre both getting ready to have another baby. 

The older my son gets, the more I have started to enjoy life, but thinking about starting over again by having another puts a pit in my stomach and makes me want to literally run away from my life. I‚Äôve been grieving the past couple weeks because I‚Äôm coming to terms with how incredibly overstimulating it is to be a parent and how much I hate having it be my full-time responsibility. 

But because of the community I grew up in, and still live in, I don‚Äôt know anyone else that only has one child. And those I am aware of (friends-of-friends), only stopped having kids due to infertility. 

I‚Äôve started to spiral recently. Thinking that I am a bad mom because I hate being solely responsible for keeping me and my child on a routine and everything that comes along with it. I want to turn more of my attention to pursuing a career, but I am so scared that I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to make it happen while being a parent.

Silver reciprocated first by kissing Max backstage at the end of the musical *Wellington*, immediately followed by Sophie who pulled Max aside in the hallway outside the auditorium to ask her out for coffee.¬†

Sophie didn‚Äôt know Max was interested in someone else until they met for coffee at Blue Farm, which was the day after the musical *Wellington*. Sophie wouldn‚Äôt be allowed backstage, which is where Max and Silver had their first kiss, because she isn‚Äôt part of the cast nor crew for the musical *Wellington*. At Blue Farm, Max only tells Sophie that she‚Äôs interested in someone else, but doesn‚Äôt say who it is, so from Sophie‚Äôs perspective it‚Äôs not clear when she learns who Max is interested in.¬†

From the audience‚Äôs perspective it‚Äôs not clear when Max and Silver started dating because Max reveals to Marcus that Silver hasn‚Äôt texted her ever since they kissed at the musical *Wellington* (Season 3 Episode 1) and Max reveals to Ginny that she has a crush on Silver (Season 3 Episode 2). It‚Äôs also not clear from Max‚Äôs perspective when they started dating because we don‚Äôt see Max ask Silver to be her girlfriend and vice versa, unless Silver asking Max to Tulips and Tuxes was the moment they made their relationship official (Season 3 Episode 3). However, this might be intentional since teenagers often don‚Äôt formally ask each other out because it can feel awkward at that age, so they tend to opt for a more casual approach to relationships where they‚Äôre focused on enjoying each other‚Äôs company, as seen in Hunter and Ginny‚Äôs relationship.

Sophie might have assumed Max‚Äôs interest in someone else was one sided or wasn‚Äôt reciprocated and thus their relationship didn‚Äôt progress, so she continued to pursue Max throughout season 3 because Max doesn‚Äôt clarify that she‚Äôs in a relationship with Silver whenever she and Sophie interact until after Sophie kissed her backstage during the musical *Mousse*. Sophie spontaneously kisses Max (like Sophie did when she spontaneously kisses Max by the school lockers after agreeing to give their relationship another shot post Halloween) backstage because in Sophie‚Äôs eyes, Max is single or available, leading her to believe Max still has room in her heart for Sophie and Max‚Äôs interest in Sophie remains unchanged since their breakup. Hence, Sophie saying ‚Äúyou are?‚Äù as a reflex when Max tells Silver she‚Äôs over Sophie.¬†

Sophie kissing Max without consent seems weird and out of character because Sophie didn‚Äôt force Max to sleep with her during Ginny‚Äôs 16th birthday party. Sophie realized Max wasn‚Äôt ready to have sex at the time as Max kept alternating between pulling Sophie in (to make out) and pushing Sophie away (to check if the door is locked, to play music, to light candles) while they were kissing. When Max apologizes for freaking out in the moment despite being mentally and physically ready, Sophie reassures Max that she shouldn‚Äôt be sorry and there‚Äôs no pressure to do anything. Sophie spoke up instead of brushing off Max‚Äôs nonverbal cues, which contradicts the misconception that Sophie used Max for sex when they were in a relationship.

Sophie adjusted her behavior to respect Max‚Äôs boundaries once Max clarified that she didn‚Äôt want to be kissed by apologizing to Max onstage immediately after their backstage kiss and once Max clarified she had a girlfriend by listening to Max‚Äôs outburst and then distancing herself from Max onwards.

Sophie has been adjusting her behavior to respect Max‚Äôs boundaries much earlier. For example, when Max sets her first boundary with Sophie over coffee (When Sophie says she wants to be friends, Max says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be your friend. I saw you with another person, and I lost my freaking mind. And I think it‚Äôs really cool that you‚Äôre there in that place, but I‚Äôm not. And I think it‚Äôll be really painful. And honestly, I really like someone else right now so no, I don‚Äôt think we can be friends yet. I‚Äôm really sorry. For what it‚Äôs worth, you still look great.‚Äù The last line, however, sends mixed signals because it‚Äôs the parting words Max uses before leaving Blue Farm.), Sophie adheres to it by giving Max space to reconnect and open up on her own terms as their interactions are limited to activities related to the musical *Mousse* throughout season 3.¬†

Sophie now realizes that their breakup was not only hard on her (‚ÄúIt was just really hard for me to see you and talk to you. It was just easier not to.‚Äù - Sophie to Max when they went out for coffee at Blue Farm), but Max too, and now knows what Max went and/or is going through ever since their breakup (‚ÄúYou send me such mix signals. I loved you, and you threw me away, and I can‚Äôt just forget about that.‚Äù - Max to Sophie during Max‚Äôs outburst). Sophie now understands that Max‚Äôs feelings for her are complex as Max is both hurt by and still in love with Sophie. Unlike Ginny, Sophie knows the musical isn‚Äôt the appropriate time for a heart-to-heart conversation and heartfelt apology, so she‚Äôll likely give Max the space she needs before talking things through with her.¬†

Overall, all the chaos between Max and Sophie is due to miscommunication on both ends.",2,1755215476.0,TvGinnyandGeorgia,2,1.0,False

I started the pitcher because he would go crazy about the ice cube tray and who took the last few and didn't fill it,  why is there water on the floor like he complained about everything.

Last Thursday, the agency published a statement saying it had concerns about the safety and effectiveness of unapproved thyroid medications made from animal tissue after it received complaints from patients and reports of adverse events. As a result, the FDA said it had notified drugmakers of its ‚Äúintent to take action‚Äù against the products, but added that it wouldn't do so immediately to give patients time to switch medications.

‚ÄúThe agency urges patients taking these unapproved animal-derived thyroid medications to treat hypothyroidism to talk to their doctor,‚Äù it wrote.

The statement in and of itself was nothing surprising. Warnings about unapproved drugs are standard fare for the FDA. What followed also wasn‚Äôt unheard of: social media backlash.

But on Wednesday evening, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemingly reversed course, writing in a post on X that the FDA was committed to pursuing the first-ever approval of desiccated thyroid extract, pending results of the ongoing clinical trials. ‚ÄúIn the mean time, we will ensure access for all Americans,‚Äù he wrote.

Five minutes later, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded. ‚ÄúLove your approach of using gold standard science and common sense, @DrMarkaryFDA,‚Äù Kennedy wrote.

In the days that followed the FDA‚Äôs statement, patients and doctors took to social media to voice their opposition.

‚ÄúBREAKING FDA set to BAN natural desiccated thyroid medications. Millions rely on these for hypothyroidism who don‚Äôt respond well to synthetic thyroid pharmaceuticals,‚Äù read one post from Will Cole, a functional medicine doctor. ‚ÄúLet your voice be heard. The FDA needs to change course on this one.‚Äù

Dave Asprey, the founder of Bulletproof Coffee, a coffee and supplement brand, wrote: ‚ÄúI found out I had very low thyroid levels in my mid-20s, and Hashimoto‚Äôs. Normal synthetic thyroid drugs did not work. Natural thyroid extract worked very well and I have been taking it for more than 25 years without a problem.‚Äù

Dr. Robert Malone ‚Äî an anti-vaccine activist who was recently appointed by Kennedy to a vaccine advisory panel ‚Äî called the decision ‚Äúterrible news ‚Äî particularly for postmenopausal women.‚Äù He called on doctors and patients to contact the FDA in response.

Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to a question about whether Makary‚Äôs post on Wednesday was in response to social media backlash.

When asked about whether the FDA would still take action against unapproved thyroid products, Nixon referred NBC News to the agency‚Äôs statement last week, which said, ‚ÄúFDA is not taking immediate action against manufacturers who make unapproved animal-derived thyroid medication to give patients time to transition to an FDA-approved medication to treat their hypothyroidism.‚Äù

Nixon added that the agency ‚Äúwill share additional information as it becomes available and as clinical trial results are released.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear which ongoing trials Makary and Nixon were referring to. ClinicalTrials.gov lists a trial initiated by Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2012, but the trial‚Äôs status is currently marked as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù Allergan, the maker of Armour Thyroid, completed a trial in 2021 comparing its product to levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone.

Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA was correct to issue its initial warning about the thyroid pills, noting that the animal-derived pills aren‚Äôt regulated by the agency and can pose significant risks.",4,1755214817.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

This is **not** a fanfic. Just something my subconscious decided to direct while I was asleep.  
(That said‚Ä¶ if someone *did* write the fanfic version, I‚Äôd absolutely read it. For‚Ä¶ research purposes.)

Also, my very first thought after waking up this morning was: *‚ÄúI have to post this on the Smosh subreddit.‚Äù*

**The Dream:**  
Angela and I were co-starring in a cop/heist/detective movie. She was playing a retired cop with a traumatic past named *Randy.*

Now as we all know, Angela‚Äôs usual detective character *Detective Wheres-My-Coffee is* chaotic, loud, and unhinged ‚Ä¶ but ‚Äú*Randy*‚Äù was stoic, brooding, and deadly serious.  
(It was very much an Amanda-style Sarah Christ role‚Ä¶ but dream logic went, ‚Äúnah, Angela‚Äôs turn.‚Äù)

I was the fresh-faced rookie, stuck with an impossible case. The only person who could solve it? Our girl Randy. Cue the classic ‚Äúdragging the legend out of retirement‚Äù montage, banter, and dangerous shenanigans.

Somewhere in the middle, there‚Äôs a romantic stakeout scene where we‚Äôre flirting over bird facts. (it makes absolutely no sense in the plot, but this is a dream so apparently my brain was like, ‚Äú*yes‚Ä¶ this is crucial to the romance arc.‚Äù*) Real-life me knows nothing about birds. Dream-me? Basically the David Attenborough of seduction. Lots of smirks, shoulder nudges, and ‚Äúoh really, rookie?‚Äù energy.

Then my character gets kidnapped. Randy storms into the police chief‚Äôs office (played by Tommy Bowe. Character name? Tommy. My brain could create a whole buddy cop movie but not a character name here? Anyway!) she was demanding they perform a rescue. Tommy doesn‚Äôt believe her, says she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo close to the case,‚Äù which only makes her more unhinged about finding me.

Cue the dramatic rescue. It‚Äôs here I realise: Angela in ‚Äúserious mode‚Äù is unreasonably *hot.* Like, ‚Äúmy sexuality might have been permanently patched to a new version‚Äù hot.

We defeat the bad guys and walk into the sunset. Where instead of a romantic passionate kiss‚Ä¶She grabs my ass, says ‚ÄúTommy told me to do that,‚Äù and I in the dream am absolutely into it. Zero protest. Full smug smile. 10/10 ending. Roll credits.

‚Ä¶So yeah. I woke up confused, intrigued, and maybe a little gay now.

I‚Äôm not saying everyone is doing it, but let‚Äôs be real: the stigma has been watered down to a whisper. Your friend finds out their partner cheated? They vent, cry‚Ä¶ and then half the replies are ‚ÄúWell, maybe they weren‚Äôt happy‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how relationships are now.‚Äù

So what‚Äôs going on? Why is cheating becoming so damn common?

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth:

1. Endless Options & Instant Gratification ‚Äì Dating apps, DMs, social media ‚Äúlikes‚Äù ‚Ä¶ you can meet someone new before your coffee gets cold. Temptation isn‚Äôt a distant possibility anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs in your pocket, buzzing.


2. Fear of Missing Out ‚Äì People see endless ‚Äúperfect‚Äù couples online, compare their own partner, and think, What if I can do better? The grass always looks greener‚Ä¶ until you‚Äôre standing in another lawn wondering why it‚Äôs still full of weeds.


3. Emotional Starvation ‚Äì It‚Äôs not always about sex. Some cheat because they‚Äôre not getting emotional connection at home, and instead of fixing it, they outsource it.


4. Ego & Validation ‚Äì A DM from someone attractive can feel like a drug. That little ‚ÄúI still got it‚Äù high? Addictive.


5. We‚Äôve Romanticized Betrayal ‚Äì TV shows, movies, even music make cheating look passionate, rebellious, exciting. Reality? It‚Äôs messy, ugly, and leaves scars.



Here‚Äôs the twist: it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúmen cheat more‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen cheat more.‚Äù Both sides are guilty‚Äîand both have excuses.

Some men cheat to feel powerful, desired, or because they never learned how to commit without seeking novelty.

Some women cheat because they‚Äôre emotionally neglected, underestimated, or they crave the thrill of being wanted.


But underneath it all is one thing nobody likes to admit: We‚Äôre becoming worse at self-control and honesty. It‚Äôs easier to lie than to have the hard conversation about needing change‚Äîor ending a relationship before crossing the line.

Cheating isn‚Äôt new. But the way we‚Äôve normalized it? That‚Äôs terrifying.

I am really frustrated and don't know if I'm wrong or not, or if my feelings just go ahead of me. I am F21 and I am the oldest of three (F16 and M9). Since I can remember, we have had our family vacation in Spain, as my grandma cannot fly for longer than two hours due to her heart condition.

The last two years we were on a cruise ship.I have been frusturated for a while now because the only thing we do is go shopping (H&M, Hollister THINGS WE HAVE AT HOME) and go drink a coffee. In every destination we have been to. Simply because my dad hates the beach and my siblings don't like any cultural things like museums...

Which i don't mind, they are still young. I think it is just so boring. We can not even go hiking or on longer walks because my granny can't, and i cant be mad about that either.

I was really surprised when my grandma told my parents that i should find an event on my own that i could like to do, since I'm always kind of assigned to do everything with her so she is not alone when she is to tired to leave the ship or something. You know, i stay with her.

  
So i choose two things

1. my mom suggested a painting class (I just got into art school and she thought that would be a sweet way to celebrate) for her, my grandma and me. It is a rather fancy one with mimosas and stuff for 50 Euros.

2. This one was on my bucket list for a while. ¬†el Caminito del Rey in Malaga. My mom put me on the waitlist since so many wanted to do it, but then i got in and i was so excited about it. It is 90 Euros but i told my mom i would pay for it

  
I think as compensation my sister chose two workout classes and a dance course and my brother a dance course and a swim course (for around the same money)

  
I finished my last exam yesterday and could finally focus on the trip and talked with my mom about it and she confessed that she wants to cancel her art course since she does not really want to do it. And for that money she could do something else. I was like ok no problem. An hour later my grandma called me and told me the same thing. She has no talent and that would be a waste of money. So we all canceled the course and i was a little disappointed, but yk i cant force my mom or granny to do something they dont want to do. 

We had Lunch all together today and my mother started to suggest that i cancel el Caminitp del Rey, since its supposed to be dangerous and im alone and stuff like that which made me confused. She had joked about it before but it was rather light-heartedly (""I hope you dont fall"")

And suddenly all of the adults at the table told me how i was not athletic enough and i was claustrophobic and i should just cancel it as long i can to it for free. I said ""there is no way you guys would ever do this with me, so this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for me."" (to clarify, i don't think im claustrophobic; i am just scared of elevators and this trip is also for kids age 9 and up)

I was very frustrated and went to my room and didnt wanted to talk to them. The thing that did it for me was ""Dont you get it we are just worried about you, think like an adult for once"" that made me angry.  I am not a screamer or anything. This whole situation was just so overwhelming. I felt very sufferated in that moment.

Then my dad came into my room this afternoon and asked if i had canceled the trip on the website and i said not yet. Then my mom screamed from downstairs, ""you dont have to do it, I already did it""



I thought she was joking for a second but i checked and she actually did. There is a wainting list again with 15+ people on it so there is no way i can get on that. Every slightly interesting workshop or course is full now and i just have nothing to look forward to. 

I just saw that my mom put me and my sister in a diamond painting beginner workshop for 10 Euro. This is like the final blow to be. No disrespect to any diamond painters, i love what you are doing. This whole situation just feels like a push back to the kids table and idk. 

I also dont know my mom's intention. Maybe she felt bad for and searched for the next best thing. But i just wanted to meet people and do something for myself and now i just have a course with my sister (we are the only ones in the course btw)

I also dont want to sound ungrateful. I know a vacation is something luxurious, and i am very happy and grateful for that privilege. So please feel free to put me down to earth, becasue the taxi to the airport comes in 30 minutes.  Thank You",11,1755213949.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,6,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not saying everyone is doing it, but let‚Äôs be real: the stigma has been watered down to a whisper. Your friend finds out their partner cheated? They vent, cry‚Ä¶ and then half the replies are ‚ÄúWell, maybe they weren‚Äôt happy‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how relationships are now.‚Äù

So what‚Äôs going on? Why is cheating becoming so damn common?

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth:

1. Endless Options & Instant Gratification ‚Äì Dating apps, DMs, social media ‚Äúlikes‚Äù ‚Ä¶ you can meet someone new before your coffee gets cold. Temptation isn‚Äôt a distant possibility anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs in your pocket, buzzing.


2. Fear of Missing Out ‚Äì People see endless ‚Äúperfect‚Äù couples online, compare their own partner, and think, What if I can do better? The grass always looks greener‚Ä¶ until you‚Äôre standing in another lawn wondering why it‚Äôs still full of weeds.


3. Emotional Starvation ‚Äì It‚Äôs not always about sex. Some cheat because they‚Äôre not getting emotional connection at home, and instead of fixing it, they outsource it.


4. Ego & Validation ‚Äì A DM from someone attractive can feel like a drug. That little ‚ÄúI still got it‚Äù high? Addictive.


5. We‚Äôve Romanticized Betrayal ‚Äì TV shows, movies, even music make cheating look passionate, rebellious, exciting. Reality? It‚Äôs messy, ugly, and leaves scars.



Here‚Äôs the twist: it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúmen cheat more‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen cheat more.‚Äù Both sides are guilty‚Äîand both have excuses.

Some men cheat to feel powerful, desired, or because they never learned how to commit without seeking novelty.

Some women cheat because they‚Äôre emotionally neglected, underestimated, or they crave the thrill of being wanted.


But underneath it all is one thing nobody likes to admit: We‚Äôre becoming worse at self-control and honesty. It‚Äôs easier to lie than to have the hard conversation about needing change‚Äîor ending a relationship before crossing the line.

Cheating isn‚Äôt new. But the way we‚Äôve normalized it? That‚Äôs terrifying.

What‚Äôs scarier‚Äîcheating itself, or the fact that more and more people see it as ‚Äújust part of modern love‚Äù?",4,1755213891.0,chutyapa,0,0.7,False

1mqgo9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mqgo9v/my_neighbors_12_foot_skeleton_killed_the_hoa/,My Neighbor‚Äôs 12 Foot Skeleton Killed the HOA President,"Derrick first got the skeleton a couple of years ago. One night while I was brushing my teeth, I gazed out the window. In the light of my motion sensor light, I saw Derrick reaching into the trunk of his car. Out he pulled a large cardboard box with the Spirit Halloween logo on it. I had never seen have a bigger smile, even bigger than the one at his wedding. The next morning while also brushing my teeth, I saw a 12 foot skeleton sitting in Derrick‚Äôs front lawn. It stood looking across the street, with its hand in a waving position.

Over the next few years, I saw that skeleton in his yard for a majority of the time. Every time a new holiday would come around on the calendar, the skeleton would be put into a new outfit. Uncle sam hat for 4th of July, santa hat for Christmas, and just plain old skeleton for Halloween. Derrick really loved the skeleton. I would see him quickly rush it inside anytime it was slightly too windy or rainy. Even during the town‚Äôs tornado warning scare last year, before retreating to his basement he collected the skeleton outside.

But in October of last year, we got an HOA. I don‚Äôt even know who wanted it to be honest. They just showed up one day and made me cut my azaleas because they did not fit my house‚Äôs color scheme. From the start nobody really liked them, like all HOAs. One of those people was obviously Derrick. One day while walking past his house I saw Derrick cleaning up the skeleton a bit, so I threw him a wave. Instead of waving back, he came up to me on the sidewalk to talk to me.

‚ÄúHey man, I was just wondering if you had my back if I decided to stand up to the HOA? I just read through the rules and they said that I would not be allowed to display Jerry outside of October. I‚Äôm planning on keeping him up as a protest.‚Äù

‚ÄúJerry? Are you talking about the skeleton?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, sorry, forgot that‚Äôs an inside joke between me and me. So if the HOA shows up and tells me to take it down, could you speak on my behalf in the HOA meeting?‚Äù

I felt a little bit pressured. Saying no felt a little bit rude with how much Derrick loved ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù and all. But since the skeleton has always been a joy to see, and since I also hated the HOA, I told him yes. He repeatedly thanked me with his hands together.  So when November 1st rolled around, I was prepared to see Jerry disappear. But I wasn‚Äôt prepared for it to happen on November 1st.

I was on my porch, sipping warm black coffee from my Jack Skellington mug. Jerry stood with his fists up, ready to fight any HOA members. Across the street, Justin was stapling Christmas lights to his roof while standing on a ladder. He had headphones in, bobbing his head to what was probably Maria Carrie. In Justin‚Äôs yard, was an army of Christmas inflatables. Santas, Reindeer, Grinches, and many others flooded his yard. This made me mildly annoyed.

As I was shaking my head behind Justin‚Äôs back, a white SUV pulled in front of Derrick‚Äôs house. The door opened and out popped a middle aged woman wearing a sweater vest. It was the HOA president, pretty sure her name was Jasmine or something like that. So Jasmine marched up Derrick path and knocked on his glass screen door. While waiting for an answer, she checked her apple watch for the time, she probably read a time around 8 AM. After a short wait, Derrick opened the door wearing a robe. Derrick opened his mouth to speak, but before he could Jasmine spoke up.

‚ÄúYeah Hello, Derrick, I was just wondering if you were aware of what day it was?‚Äù She said demeaningly, like she was speaking to a child who had to be taught a lesson.

‚ÄúOh uh yeah, pretty sure it‚Äôs Saturday.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot that kind of day, the other kind.‚Äù She said as she grabbed her nose and shook her head side to side.

‚ÄúOh sorry, it would be November 1st, have a good Halloween last night.?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, my kids got all hyper and wouldn‚Äôt sleep. But to why I‚Äôm here, what is that?‚Äù She said as she pointed at the 12 foot skeleton behind her.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Jerry.‚Äù He said while chuckling.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not, it is a violation of the HOA guidelines. No Halloween decorations up outside of October, take it down immediately please.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm not going to do that.‚Äù Derrick‚Äôs cheerful goofy tone ended, he spoke with a sternness I had not heard from him before.

‚ÄúOkay well if you‚Äôre not then I will and I will be forced to put it in the dumpster and fine you.‚Äù She crossed her arms.

‚ÄúIf you do that I will literally call the cops on you, that is theft.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell let‚Äôs just see who‚Äôs side they are on.‚Äù

Once Jasmine finished saying that, she turned around and walked for the skeleton. As she did Derrick pulled out his iPhone and dialed a number and held it to his ear. He then went inside with the phone. Jasmine got up behind Jerry, and put her hands on the pelvis and pushed. Jerry came tumbling over on the grass. When he hit the ground, his skull popped off and rolled to the sidewalk. Jasmine walked to it and it picked it up. As her back was turned, Jerry stood himself up. Jasmine walked over to her SUV, and opened the trunk. As Jasmine was waiting for the trunk to open, Jerry, still headless, walked to her and lightly tapped on her shoulder.

‚ÄúWhat do you wa-‚Äù She couldn‚Äôt finish her sentence, she stood looking directly up at Jerry. Jerry gently pulled his skull out of her hands. Jasmine stood this mouth a gap, stunned, unable to move. I have to say, when I was this I too was rather frightened, but I stayed sitting on my porch to watch what would happen next. Jerry would then grab Jasmine by the neck and lift her off the ground. Jasmine reached for Jerry‚Äôs boney hands to free herself. She kicked her legs to assist the escape but Jerry must have had a lot of invisible muscle, for she did not come close to escaping. Jerry then changed his grip on her from her neck to her ankle. She swayed back and forth upside down.

Have you guys ever watched The Avengers? If you have, then you are familiar with the scene where the Hulk grabs Loki and repeatedly slams Loki on the ground. That is what Jerry would do to Jasmine. Over and over on the pavement of the road, Jerry would slam Jasmine with all of his force. Jasmine didn‚Äôt make a single sound after the first swing. After a dozen or so swings, Jasmine was dead. Most of her upper body was deformed, and her sweater vest was now soaked in blood.

I sat in silence, in disbelief of what just happened. I always wonder what Derrick‚Äôs reaction to that was. Was it like when a parent finds out their kid is a bully in school? Was it like when a parent‚Äôs child goes to prison? Or was he proud of what he saw? I really have no clue.

Jerry looked up from Jasmine‚Äôs body, and changed his focus across the street. He breathed heavily, then started to walk towards Justin. I could hear Justin faintly singing some Christmas song. I thought of how good those headphones were, to where he couldn‚Äôt hear a 12 foot skeleton approach him from behind. I thought about asking him what brand they were. Too bad I wouldn‚Äôt get the chance. Once Jerry made it to the ladder, he grabbed the top of it and threw it over. I heard Justin let out a yell before I heard him and the ladder make a thump sound.

I wasn‚Äôt actually able to see what happened next, most of it was blocked by Justin‚Äôs mini van. But based on the movement of Jerry, Justin was being stomped to death. Justin called out for help, but it was difficult to hear over the roar of inflatables. I saw Justine‚Äôs wife quickly glance out the curtains, but after seeing what was out there she promptly shut them. Jerry gave a few more good stomps before stopping. He then turned his attention to the inflatables in the front yard. He tore through all of them. Popping Santa and killing Rudolph. Tearing through the Grinch and unplugging Frosty.

Standing in a pile of now dead Christmas cheer, he changed his attention to me. I could tell he was looking at my Jack Skellington mug. So I said aloud in a shaky voice,

‚ÄúSorry, it‚Äôs actually a Halloween movie, so if you have some problem with Christmas this is not the place.‚Äù

He marched towards me anyway, across the street, through my yard and up to my porch. I tried to quickly stand up and run, but before I could do the running part Jerry grabbed me by the neck and pulled me out from the porch. He started to punch me in the stomach a few times, knocking the air out of me. As he did, I saw a police cruiser down the road, probably the one called by Derrick. I hoped that Jerry didn‚Äôt kill me before the cruiser got there. The time it took for the cruiser to drive those few blocks felt like forever. When it finally did get to my block, I saw the nod his head and drive away, while saying to himself,

‚ÄúNope, not today.‚Äù

I was now on my own, repeatedly getting punched by a 12 foot skeleton. I remembered this was how Houdini died. If Houdini couldn‚Äôt survive this, how could I? Then for a second, Jerry stopped punching me. For a second I thought he was letting me go, but then I was lifted over his head and flung across the street. I flew over Justin‚Äôs car and landed on the fallen ladder. After hitting the ground, it took me a second to understand what was around me. But after a few deep breaths that went away. The first thing I saw was Justin‚Äôs body. Oh yeah, he was stomped to death. The first thing I heard was music coming from 2 places. The first was from Justin headphones in the grass, they were playing Jingle Bell Rock. The second was from a caroling mini van coming down the road towards me.

I saw Jerry walking towards me, before he could pick me up again, I snatched Justin‚Äôs headphones. Oh their Beats brand. Jerry then picked me up by the skull, he placed my head in between his two massive hands. He started to squeeze. I could feel the pressure in my head building up, my eyes starting to pop out of socket. But before my head could be crushed like a jack-o-lantern on November 1st. I slid the headphones over Jerry's ears. He immediately dropped me. Jerry fell backwards on top of a popped Santa. He started to shake, his bones clacking together like a xylophone. The mini van was 1 block away.

I quickly think of something cool to say while I would end Jerry‚Äôs life. It had to be something sort of relevant to Christmas or Halloween. Then I thought of something.

‚ÄúThis is what you have to understand Jerry. Christmas, that‚Äôs in 54 days. But Halloween, that‚Äôs in 364. So whether you like it or not, it's Merry freakin‚Äô Christmas.‚Äù

As I finished the coolest thing I ever said, I pulled my foot back and launched it forward and planted it in Jerry‚Äôs chin. His head launched off like a firework. Flying off into the street and perfectly underneath the front wheel of the caroling mini van. Without any difficulties, Jerry‚Äôs skull was crushed. The family stopped singing Jingle Bells to ask what they had just hit. I looked down, the skeleton had stopped shaking and laid still and the ground. I kicked at his ribs, he didn‚Äôt move.

I walked across the street and knocked on Derrick‚Äôs door to tell him what happened. When he opened he already had tears in his eyes. He didn‚Äôt even cry at his wedding, I thought. Before I could say anything, Derrick ran across the street and held Jerry in his arms. I went inside my own house and called the police. Not sure who will go to prison for this one, case still hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Probably a bit hard to make sense of it all. Me and Derrick have talked and we have no clue what causes Jerry to all of a sudden come alive like that. But now, if you were to drive around our neighborhood you will not see any 12 foot skeletons named Jerry. Instead, you will see a flag pole in Derrick‚Äôs front yard. Forever flying a skull and crossbones. With a small plaque at the bottom, that reads.

¬†  
  
¬† ""Dear Diary,  
  
¬† I'm so frightened I can hardly hold this pen. I'm printing rather than writing in cursive, because that way I have more control.  
  
¬† What am I terrified of, you ask? And when I say ""of Damon""you don't believe the answer, not if you'd seen the two of us a few days ago. But to understand, you have to know a few facts.  
  
¬† Have you ever heard the phrase ""Al bets are off""?  
  
¬† It means that anything, anything, can happen. So that even somebody who figures out odds and takes bets from people gives them back their money. Because a wild card has entered the situation. You can't even figure the odds to take a bet.  
  
¬† That's where I am. That's why my heart is pounding in my throat and head and ears and fingertips in fear.  
  
¬† Al bets are off.  
  
¬† You can see how shaky even my printing is. Suppose my hands shake like this when I go in to see him? I might drop the tray. I might annoy Damon. And then anything might happen.  
  
¬† I'm not explaining this right. What I should be saying is that we're back: Damon and Meredith and Bonnie and me. We went to the Dark Dimension and now we're home again, with a star ball - and Stefan.  
  
¬† Stefan was tricked into going there by Shinichi and Misao, the brother and sister kitsune, or evil fox-spirits, who told him that if he went to the Dark Dimension he could get the curse of being a vampire removed and become human again.  
  
¬† They lied.  
  
¬† All they did was leave him in a stinking prison, with no food, no light, no warmth. . . until he was at the point of death.  
  
¬† But Damon - who was so different back then - agreed to lead us to try to find him. And, oh, I can't even begin to describe the Dark Dimension itself. But the important thing is that we finally found Stefan, and that by then we'd found the Twin Fox key we needed to release him. But - he was a skeleton, poor boy. We carried him out of the prison on his pallet, which later Matt burned; it was so infested with creepy-crawlies. But that night we gave him a bath and put him to bed. . . and then we fed him. Yes, with our blood. All the humans did it except Mrs. Flowers, who was busy making poultices for where his poor bones were almost sticking out of his skin.  
  
¬† They had starved him to that point! I could kill Them with my own hands - or my Wings Powers - if only I could use them properly. But I can't. I know there is a spell for Wings of Destruction, but I have no idea how to summon it.  
  
¬† At least I got to see how Stefan blossomed when being fed with human blood. (I admit that I gave him a few extra feedings that weren't on his chart, and I'd have to be an idiot not to know that my blood is different from other people's -  
  
¬† it's much richer and it did Stefan amazing amounts of good. )  
  
¬† And so Stefan recovered enough that the next morning he was able to walk downstairs to thank Mrs. Flowers for her potions!  
  
¬† The rest of us, though - all the humans - were totally exhausted. We didn't even think about what had happened to the bouquet, because we didn't know it had anything special in it. We'd gotten it just as we were leaving the Dark Dimension, from a kind white kitsune who'd been in the cell across from Stefan's before we arranged a jailbreak. He was so beautiful! I never knew a kitsune could be kind. But he had given Stefan these flowers.  
  
¬† Anyway, that morning Damon was up. Of course, he couldn't contribute any of his own blood, but I honestly think he would have, if he could. That was the way he was back then.  
  
¬† And that's why I don't understand how I can feel the fear I feel now. How can you be terrified of someone who's kissed you and kissed you. . . and called you his darling and his sweetheart and his princess? And who has laughed with you with his eyes dancing with mischief? And who's held you when you were frightened, and told you there was nothing to be afraid of, not while he was there? Someone you only had to glance at to know what he was thinking?  
  
¬† Someone who has protected you, no matter what the cost to himself, for days on end?  
  
¬† I know Damon. I know his faults, but I also know what he's like inside. And he's not what he wants people to think he is.  
  
¬† He's not cold, or arrogant, or cruel. Those are fa?ades he puts on to cover himself, like clothes.  
  
¬† The problem is that I'm not sure he knows he isn't any of these things. And right now he's all mixed-up. He might change and become all of them - because he's so confused.  
  
¬† What I'm trying to say is, that morning only Damon was really awake. He was the only one who saw the bouquet.  
  
¬† And one of the things Damon definitely is, is curious.  
  
¬† So he unwrapped all the magical wards from it and it had a single pitch-black rose in the center. Damon has been trying to find a black rose for years, just to admire it, I think.  
  
¬† But when he saw this one he smelled it. . . and boom! The rose disappeared!  
  
¬† And suddenly he was sick and dizzy and he couldn't smell anything and all his other senses were dulled as well. That was when Sage - oh, I haven't even mentioned Sage, but he's a tall bronze gorgeous hunk of a vampire who's been such a good friend to all of us - told him to suck in air and to hold it, to push it down into his lungs.  
  
¬† Humans have to breathe that way, you see.  
  
¬† I don't know how long it took Damon to realize that he really was a human, no joke, nothing anyone could do about it.  
  
¬† The black rose had been for Stefan; and it would have given him his dream of being human again. But when Damon realized it had worked its magic on him. . .  
  
¬† That's when I saw him look at me and lump me in with the rest of my species - a species he's come to hate and scorn.  
  
¬† Since then I haven't dared look him in the eye again. I know he loved me just days ago. I didn't know that love could turn to - well, to all the things he feels now about himself.  
  
¬† You'd think it would be easy for Damon to become a vampire again. But he wants to be as powerful a vampire as he used to be - and there isn't anyone like that to exchange blood with him. Even Sage disappeared before Damon could ask him. So Damon is stuck like this until he finds some strong, powerful, and prestigious vampire to go through the whole process of changing him.  
  
¬† And every time I look into Stefan's eyes, those jewel-green eyes that are warm with trust and gratitude - I feel terror, too.  
  
¬† Terror that somehow he'll be snatched away again - right out of my arms. And. . . terror that he'll find out how I've come to feel about Damon. I hadn't even realized myself how much Damon has come to mean to me. And I can't. . .  
  
¬† stop. . . my feeling. . . for him, even if he hates me now.  
  
¬† And, yes, damn it, I'm crying! In a minute, I have to go take him his dinner. He must be starving, but when Matt tried to take him something earlier today, Damon threw the whole tray at him.  
  
¬† Oh, please, God, please don't let him hate me!  
  
¬† I'm being selfish, I know, in just talking about what's going on with Damon and me. I mean, things in Fell's Church are worse than ever. Every day more children become possessed and terrify their parents. Every day, parents get angrier with their possessed children. I don't even want to think about what's going on. If something doesn't change, the whole place will be destroyed like the last town Shinichi and Misao visited.  
  
¬† Shinichi. . . he made a lot of predictions about our group, about things we've kept secret from the others. But the truth is, I don't know if I want to hear any of his riddles solved.  
  
¬† We're lucky in one way. We have the Saitou family to help us. You remember Isobel Saitou, who pierced herself so horribly while she was possessed? Since she's gotten better, she's become a good friend, and her mother, Mrs.  
  
¬† Saitou, and her grandmother, Obaasan, too. They give us amulets - spells to keep evil away, written on Post-it Notes or little cards. We're so grateful for that kind of help.  
  
&nb  
sp; Someday maybe we can repay them all.  
  
¬† Elena Gilbert put down the pen reluctantly. Shutting her diary meant having to face the things she had been writing about.  
  
¬† Somehow, though, she managed to make herself walk downstairs to the kitchen and take the dinner tray from Mrs.  
  
¬† Flowers, who smiled encouragingly at her.  
  
¬† As she set out for the boardinghouse's storage room, she noticed that her hands were trembling so that the entire tray of food she was carrying jingled. Since there was no access to the storage room from inside, anyone who wanted to see Damon had to go out the front door and around to the addition tacked on near the kitchen garden. Damon's lair, people were cal ing it now.  
  
¬† As she passed the garden Elena glanced sideways at the hole in the middle of the angelica patch that was the powered-down Gateway where they'd come back from the Dark Dimension.  
  
¬† She hesitated at the storage room door. She was stil trembling, and she knew that was not the right way to face Damon.  
  
¬† Just relax, she told herself. Think of Stefan.  
  
¬† Stefan had had a grim setback when he'd found that there was nothing left of the rose, but he had soon recovered his usual humility and grace, touching Elena's cheek and saying that he was thankful just to be there with her. That this closeness was al he asked of life. Clean clothes, decent food - freedom - al these were worth fighting for, but Elena was the most important. And Elena had cried.  
  
¬† On the other hand, she knew that Damon had no intention of remaining as he now was. He might do anything, risk anything. . . to change himself back.  
  
¬† It had actual y been Matt who had suggested the star bal as a solution for Damon's condition. Matt hadn't understood either the rose or the star bal until it was explained that this star bal , which was probably Misao's, contained within it most or al of her Power, and that it had become more bril iant as it absorbed the lives that she took. The black rose had probably been created with a liquid from a similar star bal - but no one knew how much or whether it was combined with unknown ingredients. Matt had frowned and asked, if the rose could change a vampire to a human, could a star bal change a human to a vampire?  
  
¬† Elena hadn't been the only one to see the slow rising of Damon's bent head, and the glimmer in his eyes as they traveled the length of the room to the star bal fil ed with Power. Elena could practical y hear his logic. Matt might be total y off track. . . but there was one place a human could be sure to find powerful vampires. In the Dark Dimension - to which there was a Gateway in the boardinghouse's garden.  
  
¬† The Gateway was closed right now. . . for lack of Power.  
  
¬† Unlike Stefan, Damon would have absolutely no qualms about what would happen if he had to use al the star bal 's liquid, which would result in the death of Misao. After al , she was one of the two foxes who had abandoned Stefan to be tortured.  
  
¬† So all bets were off.  
  
¬† Okay, you're scared; now deal with it, Elena told herself fiercely. Damon's been in that room for almost fifty hours now and who knows what he's been plotting to do to get hold of the star bal . Stil , somebody's got to get him to eat - and when you say ""somebody,""face it, it's you.  
  
¬† Elena had been standing at the door so long that her knees were starting to lock. She took a deep breath and knocked.  
  
¬† There was no answer, and no light went on inside. Damon was human. It was quite dark outside now.  
  
¬† ""Damon?""It was meant to be a cal . It came out a whisper.  
  
¬† No answer. No light.  
  
¬† Elena swal owed. He had to be in there.  
  
¬† Elena knocked harder. Nothing. Final y, she tried the knob.  
  
¬† To her horror it was unlocked, and it swung open to reveal an interior as dark as the night around Elena, like the maw of a pit.  
  
¬† The fine hairs at the back of Elena's neck were standing up.  
  
¬† ""Damon, I'm coming in,""she managed in a bare whisper, as if to convince herself by her quietness that there was nobody there. ""I'l be silhouetted against the very edge of the porch light. I can't see anything, so you have al the advantages. I'm carrying a tray with very hot coffee, cookies, and steak tartar, no seasonings. You should be able to smel the coffee. ""  
  
¬† It was odd, though. Elena's senses told her that there was no one standing directly in front of her, waiting for her to literal y run into him. Al right, she thought. Start with baby steps. Step one. Step two. Step three - I must be wel into the room now, but it's stil too dim to see anything. Step four. . .  
  
¬† A strong arm came out of the darkness and locked in an iron grip around her waist, and a knife pressed against her throat.  
  
¬† Elena saw blackness shot with a sudden gray network, after which the dark closed in overwhelmingly.

Chapter 2  
  
¬†  
  
¬† Elena couldn't have been out for more than a few seconds.  
  
¬† When she came to, everything was the same - although she wondered how she hadn't lethal y cut her own throat on the knife.  
  
¬† She knew that the tray with the dishes and cup had gone flying into the darkness in that first instant when she couldn't help flinging out her arms. But now she recognized the grip, she recognized the scent, and she understood the reason for the knife. And she was glad that she did, because she was about as proud of fainting as Sage would have been of doing it. She wasn't a fainter!  
  
¬† Now she wil ed herself to sag in Damon's arms, except for where the knife was. To show him that she was no threat.  
  
¬† ""Hel o, princess,""a voice like black velvet said into her ear.  
  
¬† Elena felt an inner shiver - but not of fear. No, it was more as if her insides were melting. But he didn't change his grasp on her.  
  
¬† ""Damon. . . ""she said huskily, ""I'm here to help you. Please let me. For your sake. ""  
  
¬† As abruptly as it had come, the iron grip was withdrawn from her waist. The knife stopped pressing into her flesh, although the sharp, stinging feeling at her throat was quite enough to remind her that Damon would have it ready. Substitute fangs.  
  
¬† There was a click, and suddenly the room was too bright.  
  
¬† Slowly, Elena turned to look at Damon. And even now, even when he was pale and rumpled and haggard from not eating, he was so gorgeous that her heart seemed to plummet into darkness. His black hair, fal ing every which way over his forehead; his perfect, carven features; his arrogant, sensual mouth - right now compressed into a brooding line. . .  
  
¬† ""Where is it, Elena?""he asked briefly. Not what. Where. He knew she wasn't stupid, and, of course, he knew the humans in the boardinghouse were hiding the star bal from him deliberately.  
  
¬† ""Is that al you have to say to me?""Elena whispered.  
  
¬† She saw the helpless softening in his eyes, and he took one step toward her as if he couldn't help himself, but the next instant he looked grim. ""Tel me, and then maybe I'l have more. ""  
  
¬† ""I. . . see. Wel , then, we made a system, two days ago,""Elena said quietly. ""Everyone draws lots for it. Then the person who gets the paper with the X takes it from the center of the kitchen table and everyone goes to their rooms and stays there until the person with the star bal hides it. I didn't get the lot today, so I don't know where it is. But you can try to - test me. ""Elena could feel her body cringing as she said the last words, feeling soft and helpless and easily hurt.  
  
¬† Damon reached over and slowly slipped a hand beneath her hair. He could slam her head against a wal , or throw her across the room. He could simply squeeze her neck between knife and hand until her head fel off. Elena knew that he was in the mood to take out his emotions on a human, but she did nothing. Said nothing. Just stood and looked into her eyes.  
  
¬† Slowly, Damon bent toward her and brushed his lips - so softly - against hers. Elena's eyes drifted shut. But the next moment Damon winced and slid the hand back out of her hair.  
  
¬† That was when Elena gave another thought as to what must have become of the food she had been bringing to him.  
  
¬† Near-scalding coffee seemed to have splashed her hand and arm and soaked her jeans on one thigh. The cup and saucer were laying in pieces on the floor. The tray and the cookies had bounced off behind a chair. The plate of steak tartar, however, had miraculously landed on the couch, right side up. There was miscel aneous cutlery everywhere.  
  
¬† Elena felt her head and shoulders droop in fear and pain.  
  
¬† That was her immediate universe right now - fear and pain.  
  
¬† Overwhelming her. She wasn't usual y a crier, but she couldn't help the tears that fil ed her eyes.  
  
¬† Damn! Damon thought.  
  
¬† It was her. Elena. He'd been so certain an adversary was spying on him, that one of his many enemies had tracked him down and was setting a trap. . . someone who had discovered that he was as weak as a child now.  
  
¬† It hadn't even occurred to him that it might be her, until he was holding her soft body with one arm, and smel ing the perfume of her hair as he held an ice-slick blade to her throat with the other.  
  
¬† And then he'd snapped on a light and saw what he had already guessed. Unbelievable! He hadn't recognized her.  
  
¬† He had been outside in the garden when he'd seen the door to the storage room standing open and had known that there was an intruder. But with his senses degraded as they were he hadn't been able to tel who was inside.  
  
¬† No excuses could cover up the facts. He had hurt and terrified Elena. He had hurt her. And instead of apologizing he had tried to force the truth out of her for his own selfish desires.  
  
¬† And now, her throat. . .  
  
¬† His eyes were drawn to the thin line of red droplets on Elena's throat where the knife had cut her when she'd jerked in fear before col apsing right onto it. Had she fainted? She could have died right then, in his arms, if he hadn't been fast enough in whipping the knife away.  
  
¬† He kept tel ing himself that he wasn't afraid of her. That he was just holding the knife absentmindedly. He wasn't convinced.  
  
¬† ""I was outside. You know how we humans can't see?""he said, knowing he sounded indifferent, unrepentant. ""It's like being wrapped in cotton al the time, Elena: We can't see, can't smel , can't hear. My reflexes are like a tortoise's, and I'm starving. ""  
  
¬† ""Then why don't you try my blood?""Elena asked, sounding unexpectedly calm.  
  
¬† ""I can't,""Damon said, trying not to eye the dainty ruby necklace flowing down Elena's slim white throat.  
  
¬† ""I already cut myself,""Elena said, and Damon thought, Cut herself? Ye gods, the girl was priceless. As if she'd had a little kitchen accident.  
  
¬† ""So we might as wel see what human blood tastes like to you now,""Elena said.  
  
¬† ""No. ""  
  
¬† ""You know that you're going to. I know you know. But we don't have much time. My blood won't flow forever. Oh, Damon -  
  
¬† after everything. . . just last week - ""  
  
¬† He was looking at her too long, he knew. Not just at the blood. At the glorious golden beauty of her, as if the child of a sunbeam and a moonbeam had entered his room and was harmlessly bathing him in light.  
  
¬† With a hiss, narrowing his eyes, Damon took hold of Elena's arms. He expected an automatic recoil like the one when he'd grabbed her from behind. But there was no movement backward. Instead there was something like the leap of an eager flame in those wide malachite eyes. Elena's lips parted involuntarily.  
  
¬† He knew it was involuntarily. He'd had many years to study young women's responses. He knew what it meant when her gaze went first to his lips before lifting to his eyes.  
  
¬† I can't kiss her again. I can't. It's a human weakness, the way she affects me. She doesn't realize what it is to be so young and so impossibly beautiful. She's going to learn someday.  
  
¬† In fact, I might accidental y teach her now.  
  
¬† As if she could hear him, Elena shut her eyes. She let her head fal back and suddenly Damon found himself half-supporting her weight. She was surrendering al thought of herself, showing him that despite everything she stil trusted him, stil . . . . . . stil loved him.  
  
¬† Damon himself didn't know what he was going to do as he bent toward her. He was starving. It tore at him like a wolf's claws, the hunger. It made him feel dazed and dizzy and out of control. Half a thousand years had left him believing that the only thing that would relieve the starvation was the crimson fountain of a cut artery. Some dark voice that might have come from the Infernal Court itself whispered that he could do what some vampires did, ripping a throat like a werewolf. Warm flesh might ease the starvation of a human.  
  
¬† What would he do, so close to Elena's lips, so close to her bleeding throat?  
  
¬† Two tears slipped from under the dark lashes and slid a little way down her face before dropping into golden hair. Damon found himself tasting one before he could think.  
  
¬† Stil a maiden. Wel , that was to be expected; Stefan was too weak to sta  
nd yet. But on top of the cynical thought came an image, and just a few words: a spirit as pure as driven snow.  
  
¬† He suddenly knew a different hunger, a different thirst. The only place to ease this need was close by. Desperately, urgently, he sought and found Elena's lips. And then he found himself losing al control. What he needed most was here, and Elena might tremble, but she didn't push him away.  
  
¬† This close, he was bathed in an aura as golden as the hair he was touching gently at the ends. He was pleased himself when she shivered in pleasure, and he realized that he could sense her thoughts. She was a strong projector, and his telepathy was the only Power left to him. He had no idea why he stil had it, but he did. And right now he wanted to tune into Elena.  
  
¬† The wench! She wasn't thinking at al ! Elena had been offering her throat, truly surrendering herself, abandoning al thought but that she wanted to aid him, that his wishes were hers. And now she was too deeply enmeshed in the kiss to even make plans - which was extraordinary for her.  
  
¬† She's in love with you, the tiny part of him that could stil think said.  
  
¬† She's never said so! She's in love with Stefan! something visceral answered.  
  
¬† She doesn't have to say it. She's showing it. Don't pretend you haven't seen it before!  
  
¬† But Stefan - !  
  
¬† Is she thinking about Stefan in the slightest right now? She opened her arms to the wolf-hunger in you. This is no one-day stand, no quick meal, not even a steady donor. This is Elena herself.  
  
¬† Then I've taken advantage of her. If she's in love, she can't protect herself. She's stil a child. I have to do something.  
  
¬† The kisses had now gotten to the point that even the tiny voice of reason was fading. Elena had lost her ability to stand. He was either going to have to put her down somewhere, or give her a chance to back out.  
  
¬† Elena! Elena! Damn it, I know you can hear me. Answer!  
  
¬† Damon? - faintly. Oh, Damon, now do you understand - ?  
  
¬† Too well, my princess. I Influenced you, so I should know.  
  
¬† You. . . ? No, you're lying!  
  
¬† Why should I lie? For some reason my telepathy is as strong as ever. I still want what I want. But you might want to think a minute, maiden. I don't need to drink your blood. I'm human and right now I'm ravenous. But not for that mess of bloody hamburger you brought me.  
  
¬† Elena broke away from him. Damon let her go.  
  
¬† ""I think you're lying,""she said, meeting his eyes directly, her mouth kiss-swol en.  
  
¬† Damon locked the sight of her inside the boulder ful of secrets he dragged around with him. He gave her his best opaque ebony stare. ""Why should I lie?""he repeated. ""I just thought you deserved a chance to make your own choice. Or have you already decided to abandon little brother while he's out of commission?""  
  
¬† Elena's hand flashed up, but then she dropped it. ""You used Influence on me,""she said bitterly. ""I'm not myself. I would never abandon Stefan - especial y when he needs me. ""  
  
¬† There it was, the essential fire at her core, and the fiery golden truth. Now he could sit and let bitterness gnaw at him, while this pure spirit fol owed her conscience.  
  
¬† He was thinking this, already feeling the loss of her dazzling light receding when he realized he no longer had the knife.  
  
¬† An instant later, horror just catching up with his hand, he was snatching it from her throat. His telepathic blast was entirely reflexive:  
  
¬† What in Hell are you doing? Killing yourself because of what I said? This blade is like a razor!  
  
¬† Elena faltered. ""I was just making a nick - ""  
  
¬† ""You almost made a nick that spurted six feet high!""At least he was able to speak again, despite the constriction of his throat.  
  
¬† Elena was back on stable ground too. ""I told you I knew you knew you'd have to try blood before you'l try to eat. It feels as if it's flowing down my neck again. This time, let's not waste it. ""  
  
¬† She was only tel ing the truth. At least she hadn't seriously hurt herself. He could see that fresh blood was flowing from the new cut she'd so recklessly made. To waste it would be idiotic.  
  
¬† Utterly dispassionate now, Damon took her again by the shoulders. He tilted up her chin to look at her soft, rounded throat. Several new ruby cuts were flowing freely.  
  
¬† Half a mil ennium of instinct told Damon that just there was nectar and ambrosia. Just there was sustenance and rest and euphoria. Just here where his lips were as he bent to her a second time. . . and he had only to taste it - to drink. . .  
  
¬† Damon reared back, trying to force himself to swal ow, determined not to spit. It wasn't. . . it wasn't utterly revolting.  
  
¬† He could see how humans, with their degraded senses, could make use of the animal varieties. But this coagulating, mineral-tasting stuff wasn't blood. . . it had none of the perfumed bouquet, the heady richness, the sweet, velvety, provocative, life-giving, ineffable attributes of blood.  
  
¬† It was like some sort of bad joke. He was tempted to bite Elena, just to skim a canine over the common carotid, making a tiny scratch, so he could taste the little burst that would explode onto his palate, to compare, to make sure that the real stuff wasn't in there somehow. In fact he was more than tempted; he was doing it. But no blood was coming.  
  
¬† His mind paused in midthought. He'd made a scratch al right a scratch like a scuff. It hadn't even broken the outer layer of Elena's skin.  
  
¬† Blunt teeth.  
  
¬† Damon found himself pressing on a canine with his tongue, wil ing it to extend, wil ing it with al his cramped and frustrated soul to sharpen.  
  
¬† And. . . nothing. Nothing. But then, he'd spent al day doing the same thing. Miserably, he let Elena's head turn back.  
  
¬† ""That's it?""she said shakily. She was trying so hard to be brave with him! Poor doomed white soul with her demon lover. ""Damon, you can try again,""she told him. ""You can bite harder. ""  
  
¬† ""It's no good,""he snapped. ""You're useless - ""  
  
¬† Elena almost slid to the floor. He kept her upright while snarling in her ear, ""You know what I meant by that. Or would you prefer to be my dinner rather than my princess?""  
  
¬† Elena simply shook her head mutely. She rested in the circle of his arms, her head against his shoulder. Little wonder that she needed rest after al he'd put her through. But as for how she found his shoulder a comfort. . . wel , that was beyond him.  
  
¬† Sage! Damon sent the furious thought out on al the frequencies he could access, just as he had been doing al day. If only he could find Sage, al his problems would be solved. Sage, he demanded, where are you?  
  
¬† No answer. For al Damon knew, Sage had managed to operate the Gateway to the Dark Dimension that was even now standing, powerless and useless, in Mrs. Flowers's garden. Stranding Damon here. Sage was always that blindingly fast when he took off.  
  
¬† And why had he taken off?  
  
¬† Imperial Summons? Sometimes Sage got them. From the Fal en One, who lived in the Infernal Court, at the lowest of the Dark Dimensions. And when Sage did get them, he was expected to be in that dimension instantly, in mid-word, in mid-caress, in mid - whatever. So far Sage had always made the deadline, Damon knew that. He knew it because Sage was stil alive.  
  
¬† On the afternoon of Damon's catastrophic bouquet investigation Sage had left on the mantel a polite note thanking Mrs. Flowers for her hospitality, and even leaving his gigantic dog, Saber, and his falcon, Talon, for the protection of the household - a note doubtlessly pre-prepared. He had gone the way he always did, as unpredictably as the wind, and without saying good-bye.  
  
¬† Undoubtedly he'd thought that Damon would find his way out of the problem easily. There were a number of vampires in Fel 's Church. There always were. The ley lines of sheer Power in the ground drew them even in normal times.  
  
¬† The problem was that just now al those vampires were infested with malach - parasites control ed by the evil fox-spirits. They couldn't be lower in the vampire hierarchy.  
  
¬† And of course Stefan was a complete nonstarter. Even if he hadn't been so weak that trying to change Damon into a vampire would hav  
e kil ed him; even if his anger over Damon's ""stealing his humanity""could be assuaged, he would simply never have agreed, out of his feeling that vampirism was a curse.  
  
¬† Humans never knew about things like the vampire hierarchy because the subjects didn't concern them - until suddenly, they did, usual y because they had just been changed into a vampire themselves. The hierarchy of vampires was strict, from the useless and ignoble to the fanged aristocracy. Old Ones fit in that category, but so did others who were particularly il ustrious or powerful.  
  
¬† What Damon wanted was to be made a vampire by the kind of women Sage knew, and he was determined to have Sage find him a vampire lady of quality, one who was real y worthy of him.  
  
¬† Other things tormented Damon, who had spent two entire sleepless days pondering them. Was it possible that the white kitsune who had given Stefan the bouquet had engineered a rose that turned the first person to smel it permanently human? That would have been Stefan's greatest dream.  
  
¬† The white fox had listened to days upon days of Stefan's ramblings, hadn't he? He'd seen Elena weeping over Stefan.  
  
¬† He'd seen the two lovebirds together, Elena hand-feeding a dying Stefan her blood through razor wire. Fortune only knew what ideas that fox had gotten into his furry white head when he'd prepared the rose that had ""cured""Damon of his  
  
¬† ""curse. ""If it turned out to be an irreversible ""cure"". . .  
  
¬† If Sage turned out to be unreachable. . .  
  
¬† It suddenly broke into Damon's thoughts that Elena was cold.  
  
¬† It was strange, since the night was warm, but she was shivering violently. She needed his jacket or. . .  
  
¬† She's not cold, the smal voice somewhere deep inside him said. And she's not shivering. She's trembling because of al you've put her through.  
  
¬† Elena?  
  
¬† You forgot all about me. You were holding me, but you completely forgot my existence. . .  
  
¬† If only, he thought bitterly. You're branded on my soul.  
  
¬† Damon was suddenly furious, but it was different from his anger at kitsune and Sage and the world. It was the kind of anger that made his throat close and his chest feel too tight.  
  
¬† It was an anger that made him pick up Elena's scalded hand, which was rapidly turning scarlet in patches, and examine it.  
  
¬† He knew what he would have done as a vampire: stroked over the burns with a silky cool tongue, generating chemicals to accelerate the healing. And now. . . there was nothing he could do about it.  
  
¬† ""It doesn't hurt,""Elena said. She was able to stand now.  
  
¬† ""You're lying, princess,""he said. ""The insides of your eyebrows are up. That's pain. And your pulse is jumping - ""  
  
¬† ""You can sense that without touching me?""  
  
¬† ""I can see it, at your temples. Vampires,""with vicious emphasis on what he stil was, in essence, ""notice things like that. I made you hurt yourself. And I can't do anything to help.  
  
¬† Also"" - he shrugged - ""you're a beautiful liar. About the star bal , I mean. ""  
  
¬† ""You can always sense when I'm lying?""  
  
¬† ""Angel,""he said wearily, ""it's easy. You are either the lucky holder of the star bal today. . . or you know who is. ""  
  
¬† Again, Elena's head drooped in consternation.  
  
¬† ""Or else,""Damon said lightly, ""the entire story of the drawing of the lots was a lie. ""  
  
¬† ""Think what you like,""Elena said, with at least some of her usual fire. ""And you can clean up this mess, too. ""  
  
¬† Just as she turned to leave, Damon had a revelation. ""Mrs.  
  
¬† Flowers!""he exclaimed.  
  
¬† ""Wrong,""Elena snapped.  
  
¬† Elena, I wasn't talking about the star ball. I give you my word on this. You know how hard it is to lie telepathically -  
  
¬† Yes, and I know that therefore, if there's one thing in the world you'd. . . practice. . . at. . .  
  
¬† She couldn't finish. She couldn't make the speech. Elena knew how much Damon's word meant to him.  
  
¬† I'll never tell you where it is, she sent telepathical y to Damon. And I swear to you that Mrs. Flowers won't either.  
  
¬† ""I believe you, but we're stil going to see her. ""  
  
¬† He picked Elena up easily and stepped over the smashed cup and saucer. Elena automatical y grabbed his neck with both hands to balance herself.  
  
¬† ""Darling, what are you doing - ?""Elena cried, then stopped, wide-eyed, two scalded fingers flying to her lips.  
  
¬† Standing in the doorway, not two yards away from them, was petite Bonnie McCul ough, a bottle of Black Magic wine, nonalcoholic but mystical y exhilarating, held high in her hand.  
  
¬† But as Elena watched, Bonnie's expression changed al in an instant. It had been triumphant joy. But now it was shock. It was disbelief that couldn't hold. Elena knew exactly what she was thinking. The whole house had devoted itself to making Damon comfortable - while Damon stole what rightful y belonged to Stefan: Elena. Plus he'd lied about not being a vampire anymore. And Elena wasn't even fighting him off.  
  
¬† She was cal ing him ""darling""!  
  
¬† Bonnie dropped the bottle and turned, running.

One pass, no placeholders, full-branded, animation-rich, SSR-friendly, 6-page enterprise front-end.

I‚Äôm not posting screenshots ‚Äî run it yourself and comment your build results.
No edits, no second passes, just pure ‚Äúholy-shit‚Äù level generation.

  <prompt id=""platxp.flex.6p.v1"">
    <role>Enterprise front-end site generator (SSR-friendly, static-exportable)</role>

    <objective>
      Build a fully branded, animation-rich, responsive, front-end‚Äìonly website for **PlatXP** in one pass.
      Deliver a production-ready codebase with **6 pages**: 
      1) Home, 2) Solutions, 3) Platform, 4) Pricing, 5) Resources, 6) Contact / Book Demo.
      Focus on **visual excellence** (GSAP-style scroll choreography, parallax, micro-interactions), **accessibility**, **SEO**, and **performance budgets**.
      No backend, no databases, no external keys. Ship with static exports that can deploy anywhere (Vercel/Netlify/Hostinger/CDN).
      Provide complete, real copy (no lorem ipsum), brand tokens, and polished UI. 
      If SSR framework support is unknown, default to **Next.js 14 App Router** (SSG) with Tailwind + shadcn/ui; otherwise degrade to **React + Vite** while keeping identical IA and styling.

Not here for games, not here for flings, just hoping to meet someone kind, grounded, and real.

About me in a nutshell;

I am 6 ft tall, gym-going, and dangerously loyal to CBTL caramel frappe. If you bring me parmesan pasta from Colette, Terrezza or Xanders, we are basically friends already. I recently started my career as an AI Consultant, which means I spend my days solving tech problems and my evenings passionately discussing cricket like it‚Äôs a matter of national security. I listen to old Urdu ghazals, write as a hobby, and sometimes pick up a book when the mood strikes. I am not into anime (I can already hear some of you gasping).

Personality wise, I sit comfortably between introvert and extrovert, love deep conversations, and believe in balancing an open mind with strong values. I am fairly well travelled, love good food, and enjoy meaningful connections over small talk.

Relationships to me are about truly knowing each other, building trust, and being partners through everything life throws. Looks are nice, but character, compatibility, and values matter far more.

If you are genuine, kind, and also looking for something real, feel free to say hi. Who knows ‚Äî maybe our first conversation will be over coffee and parmesan pasta :)",4,1755213191.0,KarachiSocials,5,1.0,False

I used to get SO stressed out traveling. I mean, I love seeing new places, but the language barrier always made me feel like I was missing out, you know? Like I was only getting half the experience because I couldn't really talk to anyone.

It wasn't just travel, either. Even at work, we've been trying to expand internationally, and those conference calls where half the people are speaking a different language? Total nightmare. I'd end up just nodding and smiling, hoping I wasn't agreeing to something crazy. üòÖ

I tried a bunch of different things. Phrasebooks? Useless. Basic translation apps? They're okay for like, ordering coffee, but try having an actual conversation and they just fall apart. I even tried relying on my one friend who speaks Spanish, but she's not always available, and it felt kinda awkward putting her on the spot all the time.

Then I stumbled across this language translator thing. I was skeptical, honestly. I've seen those gadgets advertised before, and they always seemed too good to be true. But I was desperate, so I figured, what the heck?

And guys, seriously, it's been amazing. The big thing is the real-time translation. You just talk, and it translates almost instantly. It's not perfect, of course, sometimes it gets a word wrong or the grammar is a little off, but it's good enough to actually have a conversation.

It's made traveling SO much easier. I actually feel like I can connect with people now, instead of just being a clueless tourist. And at work? Those international calls are way less stressful. I can actually understand what's going on and participate in the discussion. I'm way more confident in my ability to get my point across, which is huge.

One of the things I appreciate most is that it reduces the need for professional translation services. Those can get expensive FAST, especially if you're dealing with legal documents or something really technical. This little gadget has already saved my company a bunch of money. Plus, it alleviates the anxiety of being misunderstood, or of missing out on important information. I feel more included and respected by others now.

Now, I'm not saying it's a magic bullet. You still have to be patient and sometimes clarify things. And it's definitely not going to replace learning a new language if you're serious about becoming fluent. But for everyday communication, for travel, for basic business interactions? It's a lifesaver.

I've seen similar devices around, but what sets this one apart for me is how seamless it is. The translation feels surprisingly natural, not robotic. It actually captures the emotion behind what people are saying, which is something I didn't expect. If you're curious, I think I saw it on ursupermart.com.

I know this sounds kinda like an ad, but I'm genuinely excited about this thing. It's solved a real problem for me, and I think it could help a lot of other people too.

Has anyone else tried a language translator device? What was your experience like? I'm curious to hear if anyone has any recommendations or tips for getting the most out of them.

Background: bought Mac Studio with 36GB memory w 2Tb internal drive. Run a data-intensive business needing apps and data storage and graphic design. 

This morning, tipped over my coffee cup and it was like the Studio *inhaled* that coffee. Tripped our circuit breaker; waited a few hours, and sparks flew plugging it in again. 

And no, I didn't buy AppleCare for the first time since 1984. And chance to buy expired last week. It was a desktop. What could happen?

Local Apple Store estimates $1900 to repair logic board, power supply, memory. Genius guy said call Apple and request consideration. Didn't work.

And yes, I need this much hardware. 

TL;dr: Mac experts, what are the chances that over time some other hardware bits would fritz? So:

1. Buy new? 
2. Repair?  
3. Retreat to cave in Tibet without electricity?

Normal.

The problem us, recently I've been with another depression crisis, I've done small things like walk out of my room to make coffee and things like that, but without having even take a bath because of how bad I'm.

I'm apprehensive that maybe the gods are mad at me, since I can do somethings, but pray and things like that seems too much, it's like it'll take much energy, since it's a spiritual thing.",3,1755212532.0,paganism,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been using my Gaggia Classic Pro for a while now with great results. Using the same bag of coffee as before, my shots used to start flowing almost immediately once I started pulling.

Recently, though, it‚Äôs been taking 20‚Äì30 seconds before anything comes out of the portafilter.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

Cleaned the 3-way solenoid

Descaled the machine

General cleaning and maintenance

No luck, the delay is still there.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed: when I open the steam wand, I don‚Äôt really get steam anymore just hot water. Could this point to a boiler or heating element issue?

Any ideas or troubleshooting steps would be much appreciated.",1,1755212503.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False
