I’m so proud of myself and I feel like I’ve reached a milestone today. I have told myself for the past almost 2 years I was recovered bc I ate 3 meals and 2 snacks every day. However, i developed SUCH an exercise addiction. I was running 10+ miles every day and mentally destroyed myself. I tried to “cut back” but I was only exercising for the wrong reasons. However, today i was gonna go on a 6 mile run and just thought, why? I don’t want to, I was dreading it all day, and I just realized that there are other ways to be active besides killing myself running and dreading life. I’ve accepted that I’m going to get “out of shape” but I’m to a point where I’m so burnt out on running I would dread going to sleep knowing I was gonna wake up and run the next day. I’m so proud of myself and I’m scared for what’s gonna happen, but take it from me: exercise should be fun and a treat, not a way to punish your body. I went for a walk w a friend to a coffee shop instead. I’m just so proud of my self and scared at the same time.",1,1732075782.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

\- Check batteries in various things (headlamps, lanterns)

Soaked diced walnuts in 1:1 brown sugar simple syrup for 48 hours and then filtered the mixture through a coffee filter.  It was good, but the walnut taste was too subtle.  I also added black walnut bitters but these still didn't seem to impart the walnut taste I'm looking for.

1gvgvlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gvgvlf/not_sure_if_autistic_or_being_gaslighted/,Not sure if autistic or being gaslighted,"Throwaway account.  
I am ESL so please forgive me for mistakes.  
I live in a current country half of my life (english is not main language). Me and my female partner are 10 years together. She is native. Sometimes when we argue she suggests that I might be autistic in a way how I hyper fixate on what is being said instead of interpreting what is meant in private and by being awkward in public. For some reason on only happens with women.

Examples:  
\- We go in cafe and I want to buy for us something sweet to the coffee. there are cakes, ice cream and a single  ice cream dessert in a menu (without picture or information what it actually is). I ask server what theire ice cream dessert actually is and if I can swap ice cream flavors.  Like I am not making sure if ice cream dessert consists of ice cream and dessert but like what ice cream it is, are there any froots and if I can modify my order. For some reason this question was enough to create some sort of awkwardness. It's not like I am asking if fried shrimp rice was fried by a shrimp.

\- Had some health issues, talking with doctor via phone. I said that I fainted twice in a short period of time. After few more questions she asked me if I was conscious when I fainted. I asked her two times if that's what she really means, when she said yes, I replied that it doesn't makes sense to me -  apparently this is an example of bad communication from my end and I should have interpreted it in a way that the doctor is actually asking me if I recall the thing actually happening and she actually was suggesting that I might had memory loss.

\- I've dropped out of uni by choice when I was younger. I was studying electrical engineering and it was like a torture to me so switched to CS. Today I saw some local infographics that recently there are more offers in EE than for CS majors. So I said look, even tho I would not be happy about it but I can swap in the future if that would be needed. My so said that it could have been worse/harder if I stayed in EE all that time without remote work which I have currently - this was supposed to be to cheer me up. like I understand the intention and meaning of what she said but I completely don't understand the point of her saying such hypothetical even if it's true - it's does not make sense to me in the context and became a stupid reason for argue.

\- When I talk with my partner, during the conversation she can say something like ""someone have an opinion of something"" without saying if she shares the belief as well. So I start engaging in the topic and it turns out that it's not the case (she does not share the same opinion in what she said) and instead of considering the context - I should have asked, because that's how it is during the small talk.

There are multiple other cases like that and it drives me insane.

I feel like there is a difference in mentality where I supposed to interpret information in favor of person I am talking to even if it's really weird and even if it's said by professional. Also if service worker feels awkward/embarrassed if I asked pretty much normal question because I pay money for the service - it's automatically my fault for not getting social clues or something.

Does it sounds like I am on the spectrum, am I just socially awkward or being gaslited? It does not happen often, like once a week or in a two weeks and it becomes some sort of conversation point that there is something wrong we me.",1,1732075311.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1gvgvcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1gvgvcs/mild_bleeding_at_2_weeks_post_extraction_normal/,Mild Bleeding at 2 weeks post extraction. Normal? ,"On day 11 (after a tooth extraction of a lower molar), I tried using the syringe/irrigation tool to clean food out of my tooth socket. The food moved but it began to bleed mildly afterward. I was so afraid that it had caused dry socket!! It was my 2nd try at using the syringe and now I'm done with that thing. I'll keep gently rinsing with salt water 3-4 times a day. The bleeding stopped but during the next night (day 12), it bled a bit while I was in bed sleeping. Noticed it at 1:00am. Then, again in bed on the night of day 13 and on the night of day 14 while sleeping. Why?

No pain (only mild tenderness). No swelling. No bad breath/taste.

I am guessing that I must have irritated the tender tissue with the syringe. Is this okay/normal? Will this delay my healing? Will it be like starting my healing all over again?

I have white granulation tissue over the area and some food in there too. Perhaps that is keeping it irritated?  Do you suppose that a piece of granulation tissue or food may have been washed away and caused the bleeding? Or is it the blood clot bleeding?  Or just the skin on my gums/socket?

Lots of questions, I know...but I am worried. I almost made it to the 2-week mark without any issues whatsoever...and now this. Just when I thought that the dry socket risk might be over and I could get back to drinking coffee, eating tomato-based pasta sauces, eating chewy foods, using minty toothpaste, lifting things heavier than 5lbs, etc.) I was looking forward to reaching the 14th day and having the area fully healed.

I am concerned that maybe I won't heal up at all. Has anyone else had this? Did you eventually heal up? Did it take longer for your socket to fully heal? Am I just a slow healer, perhaps?

Can I still return to eating/drinking regular stuff at the 2-week mark or wait it out another couple weeks?

Thank you, in advance, for any answers that you can provide. I just need someone to help put my mind at ease.",1,1732075286.0,wisdomteeth,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I enrolled with a PDI who teaches at CDC, Thomas (what he goes by, not his actual name). He drives a brownish toyota vios. I had some lessons with him. One day I drove a bit faster than what he wanted me to. It wasn’t fast, I went at 40kmh on a 50kmh road, to be a bit closer to the speed of traffic, BTT warns you about driving too slowly as well don’t they? 

Anyway that was too fast for him apparently so he started rambling (typical old man style) about how learner driver must drive slow, if not accidents will occur. He made sense to me, so I took his advice. I just want to pass after all, so I went at 30-35kmh for the rest of the lesson which was what he seemed to want. 

Fast forward to (nearing) the end of the lesson, I asked him if the lesson was over. We had started 10 minutes late because he was standing around outside the car and ended 7 minutes early. Over a 90 minute lesson this is quite substantial and adds up over time. Over two lessons it’s basically half the It wasn’t as though he was giving me instructions during this time or whatever. This has also happened before. The previous time he was late, arrived and stated chatting to his friends at the coffee shop and then we started >15 minutes late. To be clear, my exact words were “Oh lesson end already ah” “ya” “but we started a bit late today”. 

Immediately he was like “ahh look you want I pay you back the money come, I don’t want to teach you already”. So obviously I’m thinking what the hell, and asked him why. He then went into ultra-defensive mode repeating “this is the kind of person I am” (我的人是这样的）. 

I’ve never had another driving instructor and I’ve never been with a school instructor either, if this is the industry standard to start late and end early, I genuinely don’t know about it. All he needed to do was say “oh this is how all the schools run as well, gives me time to prep for the next lesson”. I would’ve taken it well, I just genuinely wanted to know because of course having travelled all the way for lessons I want to maximise my time at the wheel for exposure. 

Anyway, this may be a clash of personalities if he’s the kind of older person who prefers not to be asked any questions. But what may speak to his teaching style and may be worth thinking about is that he is not communicative at all. His instructions consist of grunting and waving his hand to indicate direction. Also worth noting that during my very first lesson he fell asleep as I was driving. If you’re a nervous driver (which I am not), bless you.

Here are some of the places I've looked. 

I've sung/played in coffee shops filled mostly with women my age. They enjoy the music but don't want to be friends, only fans.

I've gone to Pentecostal churches full of single women, but I had to sign a document stating I hadn't masturbated in 6 months in order to get involved there. 

I've found a lot of women enjoy dancing. But after spending years taking lessons in 4 different latin dances and 3 different swing dances, I still don't enjoy it as much as the women I dance with, and they tell me it's obvious.

I've been told never to date coworkers. ""yOu doN't sHit whEre yoU eAt"" wtf, why? I'm looking for love, not a toilet. Moot point; I work mostly around military. 

Clubs and bars seem to have this adversarial gender warfare vibe, making it very difficult to make real connections. Karaoke bars are better, but people still tend to keep to their group.

What's left? TJ Maxx? Aldi? I've had pretty good luck with older women shopping, but I'm in my 20s. I don't want to be a stepfather to someone who is less than 10yrs younger than me. It seems like younger women don't want to be approached in these environments.

Please help me plan so that I can ensure that I do everything that's needed to maximize the usefulness of my meds!,"I've been prescribed 5mg of methylphenidate to use with each meal and will be starting them in a couple of weeks time. Very excited!

 I've seen a lot of information around the subreddit about the do's and don'ts of meds. For example, don't consume any citrus related products.

I'd like to plan out my day and get the community's feedback on making sure I haven't forgotten anything. Hope this can be used as a template for others if needed!

**- Wake up an hour before actual wake-up time. Consume first meds with a protein shake. Back to sleep.** This will ensure that meds have protein to work with, that I'll have enough water to not get dry mouth and I'll wake up feeling focused. 

\- **Wake up. Have breakfast and a glass of water with electrolytes in them. Take vitamin pills.** Water and electrolytes to avoid being dehydrated. Vitamin pills and electrolytes to replenish any lost from using meds. 

\- **Two hours after first wake up, take coffee if you're a coffee drinker.** My understanding is that caffeine can be taken two hours before or after meds. I'm not sure if I'll have coffee when i'm on meds. But as I currently drink coffee, I'd like to plan as if I still drink coffee. 

\-**Lunch time: Gym/walk/run.** Covers moving around so that body can absorb meds better.

\- **Lunch time: Take meds with a carb heavy breakfast and a protein shake.** Covers having food, protein and water. A bowl of rice here with veggies in them would mean I'm also getting my greens. Helps with recovery from gym.

\- **Dinner: Take meds with dinner. Glass of water.**  Ideally around 5pm as the half life of methylphenidate is 4 hours, and I sleep between 12 and 1. This should allow me to get a good night sleep without being kept awake by stimulants. 

**1 hour before bed: Screens off.** Ensures your brain can wind down. Read or do some cleaning here. 

**Bedtime**: Glass of water. Helps with sleep.

**Never:** Citrus or grapefruit products - affects meds. 

Did I forget anything? Thanks!

1gvgibb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contrave/comments/1gvgibb/just_the_beginning/,just the beginning ,"My sibling passed away 3 years ago and my drug of choice to cope was food and vaping. I gained about 30 pounds. This put me in a prediabetic state and my GP prescribed me metformin to control that and referred me to a weight loss clinic. I lost about 10 pounds from taking metformin regularly and it helped relieve my PCOS symptoms as well. After a 9 month wait (if you’re from Alberta you know the struggle) I finally got into see the weight loss specialist. I was diagnosed binge eating disorder and prescribed contrave. 

I’ve been taking contrave for a month and I’ve been on the full 2:2 dose for about a week. Side effects are very minimal for me. Although I did experience some mild nausea and dizziness at the very beginning but nothing too serious. But then again I have never been one to experience side effects of anything. 

I cannot express how much of a relief it is to not be thinking of eating 24/7. The cravings have almost gone away completely. I do crave things from time to time still but I don’t act on it. My appetite has gone down drastically. I’ve never had self control around food before until now, if I feel full I am able to actually put the food down and stop eating. The mental clarity was kind of overwhelming at first because my brain was always just food food food. Like wow, is this how normal people live? I have completely put down the vape, in fact the thought of vaping now makes me sick. I was going through one vape a week. I went out with some friends last weekend and had one cocktail and didn’t feel the need to drink more or get drunk like I always did before. I don’t really care for coffee much either anymore, whereas before I was at least 2 cups a day. 

Prior to starting contrave I read more negative experiences than positive ones. I’m excited to see how the rest of this journey goes.",4,1732074128.0,Contrave,0,1.0,False

I am wondering the best budget espresso machine for under 300 dollars. Maybeeee up to 350 if I can find a deal to bring it down on Black Friday coming up. I have done some reading on reddit, YouTube, etc. and have kind of concluded that the Breville Bambino would be my best bet. I plan on upgrading to a bottomless portafilter as well. I have heard that the steaming aspect of this machine is really good too. My only big worry is the dried milk that can stay on the wand and is (for some, I've read) really hard to clean off. I plan on wiping right away, with a wet rag etc. etc. but I really really don't want any chance of this happening cause I don't want to bother deep cleaning it every time I make coffee. This is where other machines with insulated steam wands (Delonghi dedica Arte for 200 right now!) would come in.

Here are some of the places I've looked. 

I've sung/played in coffee shops filled mostly with women my age. They enjoy the music but don't want to be friends, only fans.

I've gone to Pentecostal churches full of single women, but I had to sign a document stating I hadn't masturbated in 6 months in order to get involved there. 

I've found a lot of women enjoy dancing. But after spending years taking lessons in 4 different latin dances and 3 different swing dances, I still don't enjoy it as much as the women I dance with, and they tell me it's obvious.

I've been told never to date coworkers. ""yOu doN't sHit whEre yoU eAt"" wtf, why? I'm looking for love, not a toilet. Moot point; I work mostly around military. 

Clubs and bars seem to have this adversarial gender warfare vibe, making it very difficult to make real connections. Karaoke bars are better, but people still tend to keep to their group.

What's left? TJ Maxx? Aldi? I've had pretty good luck with older women shopping, but I'm in my 20s. I don't want to be a stepfather to someone who is less than 10yrs younger than me. It seems like younger women don't want to be approached in these environments.

1 month ago I got the attached results along with a 5.8 pre-diabetic score. As soon as I saw them in the portal, I immediately cut all drinks except for drip coffee, water, black tea. No candy, no desserts, only sweets is wheat peanut butter crackers or protein ball. Cut red meat down to 1x a week, IF that. Only really if kids are eating it and we are low on grocery money. Brown rice, chicken thighs, and vegetables are my staple. Lots of salads, salmon, shrimp, & occasionally sushi. I’ve made my diet pretty simple.

These numbers, they are fixable with good diet and exercise right?

We would stay in touch and even grab a few coffees, as I lived in her country for about two years, but I was having a bad time there and completely lacking self-confidence. Both of us wanted to stay friends and we've always greeted each other with hugs, but as if we had some unspoken agreement, we mostly avoided talking about personal things altogether.

This friend is drop-dead gorgeous according to basically everyone - it was of course something I noticed, but I never considered anything other than friendship for quite a while, especially as I'm demisexual. This was even more the case because I moved out of her country for a fresh start elsewhere. During some very challenging times for me in the summer, we started texting again (mostly in her language so I could practice) and a few months later, we actually started talking about personal things. Eventually I got to know that, although we all have our strengths and weaknesses as human beings, she was gorgeous on the inside as well.

Surprisingly for me, we've not only become quite close but our texts have even been a bit flirty at times. I haven't even dated for most of my life due to growing up in a controlling environment, but my confidence and comfortability with myself have totally turned around since I moved countries and I no longer feel such people are ""out of my league"" anymore. As I know she's single at the moment, I eventually decided to go for it a few days ago (encouraged by the same female best friend because of whom I met her in the first place.)

I'm trying to approach things with a healthy attitude without getting expectations up, and I'm happy to just stay friends whatever happens because she's made my life a lot better regardless. Still, sometimes there are some eerie coincidences.

We were in a wonderful 3 year relationship and constantly talked about our future, him even more than me. He hid a fetish from me he was ashamed of and ended up seeking out escorts behind my back. I found out 3 days ago. 

Obviously I’m devastated and my initial reaction was move on and no contact because I don’t want to lose my chance if someone out there will be the one for me and WON’T cheat. 

Yesterday he left a letter at my door saying his addiction to his fetish got out of control and he hurt the person he loved the most. He says he’s already started therapy and wants to overcome his addiction so he doesn’t ruin his life and his future relationships. 

He mentioned he’d like to go for coffee to let me ask my questions and to see if there is any way of working things out in the future (that for now he knows I need space and time for us both to heal).

My question is… what are the actual statistics on this? If someone has an addiction/fetish and cheated in the first place is it still possible they loved me or is this all manipulation as someone in love wouldn’t risk losing their partner? 
Could this addiction be passed on to my future children even if he resolved it?

* With a perfect **99 walk score**, it’s just blocks from Dolores Park, BART, and Valencia Street’s hottest spots (Tartine, Burma Love, Bi-Rite, and more).

* **Gigabit Internet**: Reliable, high-speed connection.
* **Workspaces**: Ample room in your bedroom, plus access to the downstairs office.

Well, the full time floral woman was let go unexpectedly and I was offered the department. I’ve worked in various floral shops and have a degree in horticulture so it made perfect sense for me to take the full time position. I was really excited about this (and honestly still am) but I was really disappointed to discover it’s not actually a promotion..

 I’ve worked at wholefoods in the past, but I have a gap of time and when I started at this store, I started at new TM pay. Which was already frustrating in itself because I’m trained in floral, Ecomm, coffee bar, speciality, bakery, and produce. 

This is a really busy time of year and it’s been a LOT more work and more responsibility. My STL seemed *sorry* she couldn’t offer me higher pay with this transition and assured me I’d get the max raise at my job dialogue in January.. but respectfully.. I would’ve gotten that anyways. 

I know the specialist title was taken away quite some time ago and I understand most stores don’t have a floral department like ours but I just feel the need to rant because I’m now taking on way more with no compensation /: plus they’re always asking me to help in produce when I literally already have my hands full .. at the end of the day I love the job and I really enjoy running the dept..

I am 51M. Two months ago I had a UTI that became a Kidney Infection.

I had to take antibiotics - 10 days of cephalosporine. In two weeks I felt much better and the infection was completely cleared according to the urine tests. An ultrasound test showed that my prostate was a bit enlarged. Early stage I. 

I felt fine, no discomfort at all for weeks until two weeks ago 

My symptoms are mild and so far without much pain fortunately. They rotate,  come and goes from urethra burning feeling, a tension in my perineum that travels from the base of my testicles to my annus. Sometimes I feel my prostrate soared. I have noticed a mild urine flow restriction which I never noticed before and which sometimes completely disappear.  Some nights I wake up several times a night, some nights one or even none. 

I have noticed irritation after drinking coffee and my discomfort is bigger in the evenings. 

My urinary - prostate system doesn’t feel like before the UTI. 

Three days ago I began to do the CPPS stretches and they have made a massive difference. I feel that my prostatitis is subsiding or at least is not getting worst. 

I am doing everything that is in the 101 section and many things are helping. 

All your ideas  and feedback is welcomed.

PD: As a note of caution. Be very careful with fluoroquinolones antibiotics. Read the FDA and EMA warnings before taking it, are real and a few pills may change your life forever. 

3 years ago I had mild discomfort in my urethra. I went to visit an urologist. In 10 minutes diagnosed  me with Prostatitis and  prescribed me Levofloxacin as a chocolate.  3 pills later I was in a wheelchair. I suffered over 20 multi systemic side effects. It took me a year to walk again and 3 years to recover from all the neurological and nervous system damage. The Levofloxacin not only devastated my health but also my whole life. 

Fluoroquinolones hurt people often due its indiscriminate prescription. There is a large network of people that has been “floxed”. It’s horrific, to suffer mild cases of FQ side effects are unforgettable and a severe case will change your life forever even if you are lucky enough to recover and don’t end with permanent damage. 

Do not expect any help from doctors. My urologist just vanished when I sent him my pictures in a wheelchair. They are mostly unaware of the dangers despite the 7 FDA Black Box Warnings, the EMA warnings and MHRA restrictions for the prescriptions of Quinolones in United Kingdom issued this year. 

A Reddit called “floxies” is all the kind of help you will get. Check the testimonies, many are of people that were warned and took them anyway. 

My humble advise regarding FQ: use them as the FDA and EMA says, only in case of serious infections and if  there is no alternative. If a doctor prescribe you a quinolone like a candie change doctor. That guy have no clue who toxic and dangerous fluoroquinolones really are and is playing roulette with your health and even your life.

We did a large panel of offerings, we made a beautifully tasting cake, and we read poems for her. It was a beautiful ritual and made us all feel satisfied and connected with our favorite goddess.

After the initial offerings, we drank and smoked mugwort together, ate cake and talked about those we have lost, strange dreams weve been having and where we were at in our lives. 
All the members in our coven seem to be at a crossroads in our personal lives so it was a perfect time for Hecate’s guidance anyway.

We were having the ritual at one of our female members house. Shes been going through a severe rough patch because of a lot of trauma from her past that has come up recently. She had never met Hecate until tonight. She cried during our ritual and called out to Hecate to help writing her book about her trauma. 



The next morning after everyone left she called me…
She said her mother in law that passed away came to her in a dream.
our coven member wanted some closure from this spirit and asked if this mother in law had ever really loved her, they replied “to be honest i never really liked you” which is not the answer she wanted to hear but said it was the closure she needed.

When she awoke the next morning she said that while making her coffee a black bird flew into her glass sliding door, broke its neck and died instantly, landing exactly in the spot where we did our ritual. 

She wanted to know if it was a sign from Hecate and if it was a good or bad thing but honestly i didnt know. 



TLDR Did ritual for Hecate. Coven member cried and asked Hecate for help and guidance. Next day a black bird died right in the spot we did the ritual. Want to know if this is good or bad sign. Thanks. ",1,1732071711.0,Hecate,1,1.0,False

Every time it’s mentioned, my colleagues and friends make it seem like I’m “lucky” or “fortunate” when in reality, I chose to sacrifice and hold on to as much money as possible. 
I had a conversation with my coworker the other day and I mentioned “if you’re not saving a little bit of money every paycheck, what are you doing” and she responded “you’re so responsible”. I had another coworker who blatantly said “I can’t decide what I want to spend my paycheck on this week”. 
Why are people so irresponsible with money? 
I am by no means lucky. My parents/family never helped me out. I’ve had to struggle my whole life, couldn’t even go to college because I had to pay bills. Now I make good money and I choose not to get the coffee, skincare, new product, etc. I just work and save. Yet everyone says “oh you’re so lucky to be buying a house so young”. Why is it that people just can’t save? Even in my lowest situations, jobless, homeless, I went on indeed and found something and worked hard at it. Now, I’m 25 and have saved 40k.

I almost feel jealous with the fact she's going out with him. To be fair, they're going out for coffee, but this guy, already I've not heard the best things about him. She likes him because apparently ""he's the male version of herself"". Her older sisters aren't too keen on the idea of her going out with this fully grown adult either, which helps me feel a bit better that I'm not on my own with this. She also told me that this fella was rather persistent on asking her out for coffee, asking her about three times on the same day she says. After she goes out for coffee with him, we've arranged to meet up, so that helps me feel the slightest bit better. I've known my bsf for a fair few years now, we are very close, our mums are close and my family are always asking about her, I care about her a significant amount. I definitely don't think she's interested in me, clearly if she's goin for another guy, but sometimes there's always these things that make me think..

Some people at the party we went too genuinely thought we where dating.

I do have an aeropress as well but I find that the coffee isn't tasting as good as it does with the french press.

I was like girl no that shit is weird. 

Overall she just seems to have huge jealousy and boundary issues. Not even towards me from her stories this seems to be a long term issue of hers and it's very annoying. 

Even this one girl we met one time because she asked to pet her dog. My friend talks A LOT and was talking this lady's ear off. Randomly enough I kept seeing this girl on a repetitive basis around town. Coffee shops, waterfront, walking. It was super fucking weird. 

Today I approached her for the first time since I see her like weekly by chance and we got along great actually and have very similar personalities. 

When I told my friend that we spoke and got along great my friend started being like ""oh what coffee shop did yall meet at?"" And talking about how she's want ro marry the girl... like girl what yall met already and she didnt seem to like you so wym😭😭😭

Also whenever I travel she kinda just invites herself along and it's like girl what who asked you to comeeeee. Are you splitting the bills??

1gvf11k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gvf11k/still_heartbroken/,Still heartbroken ,"Just genuinely very down missing my ex boyfriend. We had none of the same hobbies. But I liked that he played games like valorant and had a favorite team. I liked that he enjoyed table tennis and playing basketball. He would often talk about how practice was going. He would tell me what he was eating for breakfast and we'd chat about the mundane things about our day. We'd go grocery shopping after class and went on special dates once a month. He'd send me coffee and a surprise treat every other day. And would often take me out for breakfast or lunch. Every time we passed by flowers he'd run to buy me a bouquet and surprise me. He had the most beautiful big yellow-hazel eyes. It genuinely looked like there was 24 karat gold swirling around in his eyes. Especially when the sun hit. I could genuinely stare at him for hours. I liked how deep and calm his voice was. And how he would just talk to me throughout the day. He was my best friend. 

It broke me when I found out he was cheating. I couldn't comprehend it. He cheated on me by messaging hundreds of women on dating apps and Instagram. He even met up with some a few times. I couldn't understand why he would do this to me. He said it was because he thought I was going to leave anyways. It made no sense to me. But he explained that he had been lying to me about doing well in uni - he was failing. I found out about the failing uni a few months prior to this. And we tried to resolve things. I reviewed the dates that he messaged all those girls and after the date he came clean about failing university he stopped cheating. But he never came clean that he *had been* cheating on me. I couldn't forgive it. I saw it as the ultimate betrayal. I drove to his house and told his parents what he did. I blasted him all over TikTok. And it went absolutely viral. He called the cops on me and the post was taken down. The only reason I had even found out that he was cheating on me is because a little kid saw him watching pornography on his phone and told me. That's when I went through his phone and discovered everything. 

I literally always had his phone in my hand because I would be searching for music. Never did I think he would be cheating on me. 

It ended so badly. Yet I still think about him everyday. A therapist specializing in addiction told me that it's best I left because guys like that don't change. And that to expect another person to give me as much attention as he did is absolutely unreasonable. Because he was unemployed and failing university so all he had was time. 

Now he's employed and has obviously graduated. He moved from Canada to the States. He seems to be doing so well. 

I can't seem to find anyone like him. And I ask myself if someone like the version he presented of himself even exists. I hate it here. I hate it sm. I feel like I'm trying to get over someone that was never real. 

I think I'm traumatized by how it ended. My own reaction. And how poorly I handled things. Idk if I miss him or just feel lonely. But I genuinely hate it here. ",1,1732069548.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

I got into a serious relationship and moved in with my boyfriend over a year ago and our intimate life has been perfectly fine.

A week ago my therapist and I finally decided to tackle this trauma and process it through EMDR. It’s like a switch flipped in me and I am so incredibly anxious all the time and very on edge. I had a panic attack when being intimate with my partner and am struggling to have s*x with him, despite it being fine prior. I am unsure how to navigate this and get comfortable again.

I think we have a lot of things in common. We have the same taste in music, love nature. Love poetry. Appreciate Daddy jokes. Kakampink. Loooovveee coffee. And we both love deeply.

Thank you for letting me follow you on IG. Thanks for the follow back, too. (I really wish I sent you this message the moment you followed me back.) Thank you for letting me view your stories and giving me a glimpse of your life. There were days when I feel so down and one post from you can blow all the dark clouds away.

I always wonder what it feels like to be yours. To freely touch that thin lips of yours. To be the last person who sees you before you sleep and to be the first person you'll wake up to. To listen to your songs (may it be in videoke or in the shower). I want to cook breakfast for you. To learn how you like your coffee and be the person to make it for you for the rest of our lives.

I know you are ready to find your way back into love and you are just waiting for the right person. I really hope to be the one that you'll see waiting for you at the end of the road but I guess this will remain as a dream of mine.

I really wish I can send you this. I am not afraid of rejection. I wish to pursue you. But right now, my life is a mess. I think, I am already at the age where I should have figured life out but I don't. I don't want you to drown with me.

Guess, this is all. Soar high! I'll continue to admire you from afar. If red strings are real, I wish you are holding the other end of mine. If not, I hope to meet you again on our next lifetime, when life is a little kinder and lighter.

Please just don't disappear. Thank you.

P.S. If you have time, please look for my message for you in sendthesong.xyz. It's with the song we both used on the same aquarium set up video in IG. Hehe.
