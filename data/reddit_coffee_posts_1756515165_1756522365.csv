* ***Morning***: Arrive around 11 AM, stop by Bart‚Äôs Books (booking this trip around this, heard it‚Äôs iconic!) and grab coffee
* ***Lunch***: Thinking The Farmer and the Cook
* ***Afternoon***: Explore downtown arcade & shops, maybe do a short hike like Shelf Road Trail or wander Ojai Meadows Preserve.
* ***Late Afternoon****:* Olive oil tasting at Ojai Olive Oil Company.
* ***Sunset***: Watch the ‚ÄúPink Moment‚Äù at Meditation Mount.
* ***Dinner***:  Italian dinner, Nocciola or Papa Lennon's before heading home

Maybe, maybe, maybe stay the night at Capri Hotel.

When I should initiate a uhhhh sort-of-not-really-hangout/date,"F 18 anxious, interested in F18 avoidant lmfao (tale as old as time but I think....we're pretty healthy individually, personally im working on it)

I'm gonna have tomatoes thrown at me but all of this is happening online howeverrr !!!11 she is like, one bus away lol (also she has a car)

Ive been casually trolling this girl (as a joke ofc) for around 2 months now? maybe 3? We crack jokes and all. It wasn't until, maybe 2 weeks ago that I messaged her privately. This is so embarrassing but yea yea we were in a fandom of some sort. I messaged her  about a gc and overall, wanting her to b e more well versed in the content since she's a grass toucher lol

Here's some of our convos if you want to guess with me if I have a chance (otherwise just skip)

She actually thanked me that same morning, was very surprised I took the initiative to reach out 

I offered to create her a list and caught her up in gossip, we talked about life and stuff and she ???  asked me if she can buy me coffee ??? 

HONESTLY I WOULDVE GOTTEN LOVEBOMBER VIBES and I don't want to definitively say she isn't but, i'm gonna reach here with my intuition and say I felt nothing but giddy that day HAHAHAHAHHA.

Somehow our convos went to like her avoidant tendencies tho (I have no clue why and how) but like I later realized she was a middle child (i'm the youngest) and yk the lack of attention lmao... she kinda backtracked a bit actually HAHAHA I think she just got excited, she's a very independent and adventurous person and isnt really expressive so like she has her own little ways

One night I couldn't message her and SHE CHECKED ON MEE, I thought it was gonna be the type of convo where we dont reach out after awhile cus we kind of just gotten closebut nooo she was looking for me and stuff  #omgbruh 

WHEN I FINISHED COMPILING THE READING LIST AND GUIDED HER HOW TO USE THE SITES (this was like kind of,, maybe a week in idk, it was long and I designed it : \])  SHE TOLD ME I moved like a player and that i made her feel giddy !!11 then spammed me that night abt like, life stuff while I was doing sumn,, IT'S SO/?? Is this as big as i think it is #holyshit 

She jokes a lot about the friends to lovers trope tooo!

  
Other than that it's really just checking on each other's health (esp mental health) and trolling each other. We haven't uhhhh played a game yet cus she's busy-busy (so am I) but I plan on asking her to do so sooon, maybe today or sumn since her pc broke and I can lure her to mobile games lmfao

  
BUT LIKE I can't help but wonder if she's like this w/ all of her friends?? Esp since avoidants are never reallyyy direct (my ex was an avoidant too) idk what if she's just doing it for the vibes? lmao

  
SIDE NOTE: She does have this friend that she plays games with and kinda knows irl who's a fellow (to me) masc...I feel like this friend likes her (just my intuition lol she took her to the boxing ring knowing her body was sore from volleyball?  Just wanted a cheerleader ig? also asking her for updates i think)

Just my intuition again..maybe she's not telling me things and thats ok,,, but I'm quite unsure if my crush is interested? I'm leaning on no for now though cause I feel like she'll tell me if she did?



Now, about the hangout thing --

My parents are kinda controlling and all hahahaha esp towards me since I'm the youngest i'll actually just escape the house and she does know that...

It'll happen post prelims so..we'll be talking for around a month by then. Still pretty early imo tho.

  
I can technically pull the card that i'm kind of scared (partially true) cus it's traffic in her area, sometimes buses are full  + it's my first time going alone...and like maybe ask her to accompany me..?

  
Do note that  i'm not actually going there for her, I've been craving  this specific yogurt brand for like..4 months now and only the place in her area has it.. and they do have matcha toppings so i really want her to try itt! (hitting two birds with one stone!) 

It'll be fairly quick anyway, I don't even know if you can count it as a hangout... (Also because I don't think I can handle proximity for so long with her yet) 

  
FINALLY, MY QUESTIONS ARE !

1. Do I have a chance? 

2. Is it too early to hangout?

1n3qkjy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3qkjy,Bone System Strengthener,"It is very common that over time, our bone system loses strength, and tends to become porous and fragile. This occurs in both men and women, although in women this process is more frequent and notorious, which is known as¬†**osteoporosis**, and as the word indicates, it is the condition of porosity that they acquire the bones, and that is because they lose density, they become weaker, making them more susceptible to fractures and injuries.

  
Although osteoporosis is a widely spread disease, I believe that it can be prevented and even lessen its severity; and this is achieved through a healthy diet and exercise. There are also pharmaceutical calcium supplements, which protect the bone system, however, they are unpleasant and I believe that over time they can cause side effects (this is my opinion, very personal).

  
And since I like natural medicine so much, and I always try to use it to prevent and heal diseases (avoiding the use of allopathic medicine as much as possible); t oday I have brought you a preparation that is a¬†**strengthener of the bone system**, which gives us an additional dose of calcium that is very useful in the prevention of osteoporosis. This preparation is very simple to make, it only requires that you have the ingredients that are cheap. I consider that two of the three ingredients can be found throughout the planet, only the third element would be a little more difficult to obtain, since it is a native seed from South America, (or at least from Venezuela); however, I will share the recipe with you, which may be useful for many of you.



Previously, specifically in my second post on Hive, I intended it to talk about this seed to which I refer, which is known as¬†**Black Brusca**¬†(Cassia occidentalis L.), because it is a plant that I grow annually in my plot and I sell the seeds in my house. I cultivate it for several reasons: It is a honey plant, especially for cigarrones (Xylocopa); on the other hand, some birds known as azulejos (Thraupis episcopus), also like this plant very much; and additionally I use it in my diet and I also sell it.

# THE RECIPE

**Time, ingredients and equipment**

* Preparation time: 10 to 15 minutes.
* 4 tablespoons of pumpkin seeds.
* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds.
* 1 tablespoon of black brusca seeds (Cassia occidentalis L.).
* Resulting amount: That will depend directly on the amount of seeds you use. A greater quantity of pumpkin and sesame seeds is always used for palatability, since the black brusca is somewhat bitter.
* Salt to taste (I used half a teaspoon).
* A cauldron or frying pan, strainer, blender, plates or cups, a spoon, a sterilized glass jar.

# PROCEDURE

The procedure is very simple. First of all we have all the ingredients and utensils organized and available, in order to make the preparation quickly. In this case, I used the seeds that I extracted from a pumpkin to make this fortifier, so it was necessary to wash and drain them.

  
Once the pumpkin seeds are clean and drained, I proceed to toast them over low heat, taking care not to burn them. I do the same with the sesame seeds and the black brusque. While pumpkin and sesame seeds are easy to tell when they're roasted, brusca negra isn't, because they're a dark brown in color. We will know when they are ready, when they give off a smell similar to roasted coffee and begin to explode like popcorn, at that moment they are ready.

  
When they have cooled down, I proceed to grind the pumpkin seeds in the blender or processor. Later I add the sesame seeds and brusca negra, as well as the salt (this is optional), to continue grinding until a homogeneous mixture is obtained.

  
The texture of this preparation is similar to that of a thick powder, it is not very fine. It must be stored in a sterile glass bottle and kept at room temperature, without direct incidence of sunlight. The flavor is exquisite, because it has a marked taste of nuts. This time I only used salt to add flavor, but you can also add ground cumin and oregano. The way to consume it is to add it to meals, for example, I don't consume butter or margarine, so I use it in my breakfasts to fill my arepas. I also sprinkle broths, soups and rice with this preparation. Delicious! And it has the great advantage of being a super provider of calcium, since all its ingredients provide this important element for our health.

  
I can tell you that here, where I live, the doctors specializing in the bone system (traumatologists), when people suffer fractures or undergo surgery on bone tissue, recommend the daily intake of brusca negra, which must be roasted and ground before being ingested, thus the recovery is faster, because it accelerates the appearance of scar tissue. It is generally recommended to consume this fortifier alternately, that is, 15 continuous days (once or twice a day), a month-long pause, and then its consumption is restarted. It is highly recommended for people after forty years of age, when the bones begin to lose density.

1n3qbcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelbourneTrains/comments/1n3qbcc/some_thoughts_on_the_new_arden_station/,Some thoughts on the new Arden Station,"TLDR; Big platforms and lots of space in the tunnel generally. Great Vibe on the day, but until the area is built up more it's probably going to be ghost town.

Despite it being a miserable tropical Melbourne winters day, there was lots of people milling about. There was even ""street entertainers"" out the font. 

It's difficult to do the space justice with still photographs, but the look overall is fresh and warm, I feel. Oddly there seemed to be  only 1 ticket window? I could be wrong and am happy to stand corrected on this.

All the 'features' both architectural and artist are great, although some of the art embedded on the platform  floors was hard to spot and possibly won't handle the foot traffic too well moving forward. I love the lighting fixtures, and the skylights even on a shitty day like today were bright.

The platforms are long! There is ample room around the platforms on the tunnel, almost it seems wide enough for another line. There are PIDs everywhere. I must add though the Shark tweet or fins or whatever they're called didn't really catch my eye as I waked in so I'm o=not sure how a casual user of the space would see them as useful way finders?

I was surprised by the amount of unfinished parts there were in the station. And of course some larrikins had left graffiti in them. I didn't noice any spaces set aside for retail but maybe that's just me.

Out the back of the station was a huge video screen running a time lapse and video of the construction of the station. There were also food trucks, offering doughnuts, coffee, pizza, and other food and drink.

So all up a cold yet pleasant morning wandering around and soaking up the atmosphere of a station that is sure to go gang busters eventually. I even spotted the person who narrates the Metro shorts, on YouTube, [here](https://youtu.be/-yR_gIPWIPs)

Remote App Tester BOOM Just Changed the Internet‚ÄîAre You Witnessing This Revolution?","Has anyone else woken up absolutely FLABBERGASTED at the sheer number of companies wanting remote app testers in 2025? 

I mean, I was minding my own business, scrolling through job postings with a lukewarm coffee, then BAM‚Äîevery other posting seems to scream: ‚ÄúWE NEED MOBILE APP TESTERS - APPLY FROM YOUR COUCH!‚Äù  

Like‚Äîwait, when did this all happen?? Did I sleep through a tech hiring REVOLUTION? Because I‚Äôm shook.

Here‚Äôs the jaw-dropping part: so many of these companies don‚Äôt even care if you‚Äôre in your pajamas. They just want real people testing out apps. Some are even begging for total beginners. If you can tap ‚Äòdownload‚Äô on your phone, there might already be 2 recruiters waiting in your inbox.  

Let me break down 10 legit companies that made my brain do a double-take:

- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (Honestly, if you haven‚Äôt checked this one, you‚Äôre missing out. I‚Äôm still not sure it‚Äôs real, that‚Äôs how good it looks.)
- UserTesting (This one is classic, but now rolling out new mobile gigs‚Ä¶ what!?)
- uTest (I‚Äôve seen people get PAID just to crash apps. Hello??)
- Test IO (Did not see this one making the ‚Äúbig remote flex move‚Äù in 2025, but here we are.)
- PlaybookUX (It says ‚ÄòUX‚Äô but surprise, there are straight-up test gigs all over here now.)
- Applause (Anyone else seeing a salary SURGE? Something is going on here‚Ä¶)
- Appen (Previously for voice data, now suddenly obsessed with mobile QA?)
- TryMyUI (Had several listings this morning just hanging around begging for testers.)
- BetaFamily (Testing apps WHILE you play with them? This can‚Äôt be legal‚Ä¶)
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (Yeah, repeating this. It stares at me in my sleep. Am I hypnotized?)

This is NOT just gig money either. I‚Äôm seeing posts showing testers making hundreds a month, totally flexible, fully remote, while keeping their day job or school schedule. It‚Äôs changing so fast!

But here‚Äôs the twist that had me nearly spit out my coffee (again): Most of these places aren‚Äôt asking for fancy degrees. Some just need you to, you know, use a phone and give HONEST feedback. How has this not been a mainstream SIDE HUSTLE hack until now??

And for the conspiracy theorists among us, try visiting **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (no, seriously, link #3 because my disbelief grows every click). The incentives are wild‚Äîcoupons, digital gift cards, cold hard cash, and more!

TL;DR: If you ever wanted a shot to break into tech, make some mobile magic money, or just be able to say ‚ÄúI TESTED THAT APP‚Äù in future convos, the universe just handed it to you.

Check **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** for good karma‚Äîor a wardrobe of pajamas that finally pays your rent.

Who‚Äôs already in on this quietly booming trend? Have any of you TESTED for these before? Can we trust these wild offers, or am I walking into a Matrix-level simulation?

- Global positions‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt matter if you live in Antarctica or Cleveland.

* It‚Äôs completely free to use.

He‚Äôs smart with his money so we decided to join bank accounts ( ik it‚Äôs not recommended without any legal binding) and we‚Äôve made some financial investments with both of our money. We were strictly saving money for the investment and once we saved up enough money, he said that we should splurge a little (within reason). We honestly didn‚Äôt spend a lot, we‚Äôre both low maintenance people. So we pretty much just save money. He taught me to be more price conscious when buying stuff, which can be a little draining sometimes when it comes to cheaping out on food and some other necessities. I‚Äôve had no problem with saving up, and being conscious about my spending I‚Äôm honestly grateful for his discipline because financially I‚Äôve learned a lot from him and we‚Äôre in a good place. We definitely had some hiccups at the beginning because of our finances and still do sometimes.

I am a 2nd semester nursing student and my work schedule is becoming too physically draining (I work 3 10 hrs shifts at a physically demanding job) I decided to ask him if there‚Äôs an specific amount that we will be saving next so I can cut 2 hours from one of my days and move some days around. He tells me that we are spending a lot of money and I ask him on what, he mentions Dunkin and dollar tree expenses which sets me off. I told him how draining and traumatizing it can be to always be worrying about being price conscious on things like food, home essentials and if I want a coffee random day. He starts telling me how ungrateful I am, that he‚Äôs making sacrifices as well and he has put his wants and needs aside for us. He said that he has no direct comment towards me wanting to change my work schedule but that we should be more financially strict. He‚Äôs making it seem like I‚Äôm not interested in saving money but I‚Äôm still enjoying the luxury that the savings have provided (I‚Äôm not sure if he means me practically living rent free at his house) And I can‚Äôt honestly not express all of the sacrifices and arguments we‚Äôve had about finances. 

My thing is that if I‚Äôm going to stay at a job that I truly dislike I shouldn‚Äôt be penalized for wanting a Dunkin here or there (which I barely do because I make coffee at home), and wanting quality food when we are able to afford it and still save money. I truly love him, and i understand how important finances and saving money is, but I‚Äôm at point where I feel like I‚Äôm being gaslighted and wondering if I‚Äôm crazy.

When we first went out, everything was amazing ‚Äî we had a great first date, connected deeply, and started hanging out multiple times a week. The connection felt strong and real, and he mirrored that back to me. As time went on, he told me how much he liked and cared for me, and I felt the same.

Around the 2 month mark I noticed some hesitation on his end. It felt like he had deeper feelings but was holding them back. He would get close to saying something more, then pull away. Then he started saying things like ‚ÄúI like you so much it scares me‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too good to be true.‚Äù In my experience, when men start framing things that way, it can be a sign of fear and insecurity, which often doesn‚Äôt end well. I reassured him as best I could without focusing too much on it, but I noted it as a concern.

We also had a light conversation about him having past issues with jealousy and trust. He told me he‚Äôd been cheated on before, and that he‚Äôd cheated once himself. I mentally flagged that as a possible issue but tried to stay open.

A turning point happened after a night out. I got home around 2:30am and didn‚Äôt like his text until 3:30 because I don‚Äôt like to text when I‚Äôve been drinking (he doesn‚Äôt drink, so I didn‚Äôt want to introduce that dynamic). The next day he confronted me, saying my story didn‚Äôt add up. He implied I must have been with someone else because bars close at 2 and I hadn‚Äôt texted until later. I explained, reassured him, and told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with ‚Äúproving‚Äù where I was, all I could do was tell the truth, to which he agreed. He dropped it, said he felt better and we moved on.

The following week was great... he was affectionate and open ‚Äî but then out of nowhere, I felt a shift. He was super off with me and at first wouldnt say why. then finally he admitted he was still bothered about that night. He brought up random things he made note of over the past week like ""evidence""...like two coffee cups in my trash, or that my hair didn‚Äôt look wet after I‚Äôd said I was showering before FaceTiming. He was basically insinuating he didn't believe my story again and that I was with someone else, which wasn‚Äôt true. I told him he either had to trust me or not, but if he couldn‚Äôt, this wasn‚Äôt a healthy foundation. He got upset and said I was ‚Äúflipping it on him.‚Äù

The next day he texted me (coldly) that we shouldn‚Äôt date anymore, blamed my communication, and ended it.

I‚Äôm left confused. On one hand, I saw some avoidant behavior and red flags with trust/jealousy. On the other hand, we had such a good connection and communicated SO WELL in every other way (including disagreements), and the way he ended things was so harsh compared to how close we were. It really hurt, especially because I cared a lot and thought he did too.

So‚Ä¶what do you think? Did I miss the writing on the wall? Was this fucked from the start because of his jealousy/trust issues, or was there something I could have done differently?

The halls of the UCV buzzed once again, arguments spilling like cigarette smoke through every faculty corridor. Dark coffee sweetened the debates, while cheap empanadas turned bitter with each retort. Two years had passed since the fall of the regime, and though no one mourned its demise, few agreed on what it meant. For some, it was a national liberation, proof that Venezuelans could rise against a system propped up only by foreign patrons. For others, it was a failure ‚Äî the squandered chance to break once and for all from a post-colonial order. What had collapsed was not just the regime but the last scaffolding of socialism in the mainstream. In its place, students warned, would come an ""Americanized"" Venezuela: hyper-consumerist, hyper-productive, trading its leading role among South American nations for a back seat in the ""West.""

The debate was not a new one. Opposition to the regime had always carried the mark of class: born from the wealthy middle class, staffed by university graduates, flanked by the small and large bourgeois, and often reinforced by sympathetic officers in uniform. They were, in the eyes of the Venezuelan left, the traditional enemy, the mirror image of the country‚Äôs poor, Black, and Indigenous majority.

Ch√°vez himself had broken that pattern. He was no pale heir of privilege but a mestizo soldier, son of teachers, his charisma drawn from cadence and relatability. His rise was meant as a correction to history, a rebuke to the old mold. By contrast, his predecessors in power, Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez and R√≥mulo Betancourt, though not dynasts, carried their own contradictions. Both had been outsiders once, even prisoners of the same political system they would later inherit. Yet all three, despite their ruptures, shared a telling constellation: middle-class roots, a closeness to the intelligentsia rather than the masses, and a whiteness ‚Äî real or at least passable ‚Äî that fit comfortably within the long shadow of Venezuela‚Äôs racial hierarchy.

The first rebellions against the regime had been, unmistakably, oligarchic. In 2002 it was the oil executives, flanked by the broader bourgeoisie, who shut down the pumps and paralyzed the nation in a general strike, a strike that cracked open just enough space for a coup. For one day, Ch√°vez was gone, toppled by generals and shareholders alike, before clawing his way back to Miraflores.

Five years later, in 2007, the protests came not from boardrooms but from classrooms and newsrooms. Thousands of students and journalists flooded the streets, rallying against the tightening noose around independent media. Their chants filled plazas, but their victories were short-lived: licenses revoked, signals cut, frequencies reassigned.

By 2013, the opposition‚Äôs hopes carried a surname of pedigree. Henrique Capriles Radonsky, heir to one of Venezuela‚Äôs largest media conglomerates, tried to turn electoral defeat into a fraud narrative. He failed. Lacking proof, he watched the crowds thin and the wider population, exhausted and skeptical, drift back to survival.

A year later, in 2014, the students were back on the streets. They marched against inequality and insecurity and were met by the full force of the State. Violence was no longer an exception ‚Äî it had become doctrine. The classrooms, once a fortress of Chavismo‚Äôs intellectual defense, had turned hostile. There was no way to win them back; they would have to be silenced in blood.

Bassil Da Costa was the first to fall. Just 23, a scholarship student who had fought his way into a private university. Without that scholarship, the trip from Guatire to Caracas would have been impossible. He was no scion of the establishment, no heir of privilege; he was a child of the working margins, the very people who carried Ch√°vez to power.

By 2017, the collapse was undeniable. Supermarket shelves stood empty, breadlines stretched for blocks, looting flared with each blackout. Students marched again, some no longer students at all, joined this time by the poor. Together they clashed with riot police and colectivos. A hundred would die, thousands more were wounded. It would prove to be a milestone for the opposition. It no longer represented the shrinking Venezuelan middle class, but all of Venezuela. Clashes intensified not only in Chacao, a bulwark of the ""old"" opposition, but at the UCV, Plaza Venezuela, and La Candelaria.

The last intellectuals loyal to the regime quietly stepped aside. Some fled abroad, others retreated into silence. With corruption and violence now the only arguments left, even they could no longer defend Chavismo with a straight face. The regime, however, endured.

By 2019, it was no longer the opposition confronting the State but the opposition tearing itself apart. Juan Guaid√≥‚Äôs ‚Äúinterim government‚Äù collapsed under its own contradictions. Inside, factionalism raged, and the Alacranes poisoned what remained of unity. The old opposition did not fall at the hands of the regime, but at the fangs of its own.

The opposition now faced a reckoning. It had to reform and look inward. Many of its old leaders and emerging figures had suffered a fate worse than death: infamy. Once celebrated, they were now reviled for their perceived weakness in confronting the regime.

The movement needed new men, new procedures, and new ideas more urgently than ever. In this light, 2024 loomed not merely as an election year but as a crucible, an opportunity, however twisted, to reshape the opposition.

Across the country, autonomous movements that had survived the worst of 2024 and 2025 began to coordinate, quietly at first. They were students, workers, and the marginalized, hardened by years of loss, yet sharpened by experience. Where once the middle-class opposition had faltered, these new forces were unbound by hierarchy or inherited prestige. They had no patience for old allegiances. They needed no one‚Äôs approval to act.

2026 arrived, and the weight of years had become unbearable. A regime built on violence and corruption, sustained by greed and fear, finally began to falter. The streets, once rigid with control, now simmered with opportunity.

# And what do we think of it?

Inside the opposition, there were always two camps: radicals and moderates. The radicals had long warned that the regime could never be toppled through ballots or negotiations, only by force of arms. Their warnings came even before the authoritarian mask slipped fully, before elections became rituals without meaning. To them, every march, every failed dialogue table, was proof of what they had been saying all along.

The moderates, meanwhile, clung to the idea of a political settlement. They were lawyers, activists, and career politicians who insisted that legitimacy was their greatest weapon. If Venezuela was to rejoin the democratic order, they argued, it had to be through peaceful, constitutional means. But as the regime grew more repressive, their credibility began to erode. Their caution was read as cowardice, their pragmatism as betrayal. In the streets, where blood was shed, moderates no longer had the same standing.

Ideology further complicated the divide. Conservatives had opposed Chavismo from the beginning, not only for its authoritarian excesses but because its very foundation threatened their worldview. They saw it as a socialist experiment destined to collapse. The progressives, however, had once cheered parts of the project. For many on the left, Chavismo‚Äôs promises of equality and empowerment resonated, at least until the economy crumbled under corruption and mismanagement.

Both camps, unsurprisingly, had starkly different interpretations of the regime‚Äôs collapse. For the radicals, the fall was vindication. They openly welcomed American intervention. To them, it was not only a strategic necessity but almost a rite of passage ‚Äî the price of joining the West. Among the more *particular* voices in their ranks, it was spoken of as a kind of cleansing, a purging of everything ‚Äúbackward‚Äù that Chavismo represented.

The moderates, by contrast, framed the fall in nationalist terms. For them, it was not Washington‚Äôs triumph but Venezuela‚Äôs own revolution ‚Äî a popular rejection of the status quo that Chavismo had crystallized. They looked not toward the North Atlantic but toward South America, where they argued the meaning of the struggle would resonate most. In their telling, the collapse was proof of the region‚Äôs capacity for democratic renewal, and its lessons should be measured in terms of social justice and reform.

# Symbols and Nomenclature.

By the time the regime collapsed, the moderates had already lost the ideological battle. Their language of dialogue and gradual reform, once appealing to the exhausted middle classes, had been overtaken by the raw urgency of the streets. 

The roots of this radical culture could be traced back to the student organizations of 2017. They had carried the protests when food vanished and tear gas filled the avenues, and from those desperate marches came the first icons of defiance. Santiago Croses and blue armbands were amongst the most popular.

The FVA inherited these symbols but pushed them further. Their banners were raised in the ~~Fall~~ Liberation of San Crist√≥bal, where, for the first time, an urban uprising briefly tipped the balance in favor of the resistance. Seeking legitimacy, a new symbol for the ~~Uprising~~ ~~Rebellion~~ ~~Revolution~~ organization, General Larrazabal addressed the nation with a new flag behind him. It was called the *revolutionary tricolor,* a flag of yellow, blue, and red, each stripe equal in width, with three white stars at the center.

It was an improvisation made from the flag the State, simplified for production. FVA soldiers needed a way to differentiate themselves from regime troops. Still, the design grew in popularity. It was simple, easy to make and eye-catching. The FVA even decorated their tanks and trucks with it during their entrance to Caracas and raised the tricolor atop the Miraflores Palace.

Time will tell if the flag will stay or not. Regardless, the symbol seems will stay. Guns replacing white hands. In the meantime, students and professors at UCV will continue their debates.",2,1756520377.0,GlobalPowers,0,1.0,False

1n3q2ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1n3q2ml/a_strange_pattern_of_disconnection_showing_up/,A Strange Pattern of Disconnection Showing Up After Taking My Friends to Get Bra Sized,"Putting the TL;DR here because it's a longpost: every time I feel I'm losing a friend to disconnection, I (subconsciously it seems) reach out by taking them to get their bra's sized and then they never text or reach out after (so far).

Okay, so, this isn't really an ""I'm feeling lost and need advice with the state of my friendships"" post, it's more a rant about my placelessness in a group dynamic that has been hard to keep alive on my end because i'm more offline now, and also a strange pattern that i thought was both hilarious and kind of sad: It involves getting measured for accurate bra sizing of all things. 

Preface: I've recently been trying to disconnect from social media and having a very active online presence--i don't like the hours wasted on my phone, it makes me feel stagnant, unproductive and also kinda boring; to combat this, I've been making more space for old school hobbies, I'm more active in my day to day, training to run a 10 marathon, and I prefer to read during down time, or go to the movies, or wire essays on any new topics/books/articles I've read up on. When the weather's good and I have enough money for things besides bills and my bouldering membership card, I try to plan spontaneous dates with friends where we go to museums, concerts, new bars, or even go swimming (basically I grew tired of everyone around me--including myself--feeling inadequate, tired, overworked, and unattractive/physically unfit compared to social media personalities; I wanted a change and tried to encourage everyone around me to do more diverse activities together besides playing co-op video games or gatcha farming games, those things that all bridge us into interactive settings but also still require screen time; there was also a sense of tension during this time because, as I was disconnecting, they weren't, and as I was experiencing a greater ease with finding more things to appreciate in the moment or be joyous about, or finding topics of conversation to keep attentions sparked--i subscribed to a print newspaper to have things to talk about, I saw films regularly, I read books, discovered new coffee places without using Google maps or any review based app, I constantly invited them to join me for a hangout at any of the activity centres I went to, etc; to which none ""vibed"" with or cared to try--there was still the underlying issue of everyone else--to an extent--struggling with occilating attention spans: that pendulum of always needing to look at your phone and not being able to have a conversation for longer than 5 minutes). 

So given the context, I either fall into the category of obnoxious friend who probably reads too much into seeing someone get more excitement from their phone than from me, sitting across from them, or I've just fallen into the category of some who has... lost connection with my friend group because I've disconnected from technology. It really sucks because one of my best friends is on that group chat, and I sorta made the group chat to introduce all these friends to each other, and we really hit it off and would spend time together. I'm not saying I'm the ""best friend to have, ever!"", I struggle with depression and OCD tendancies that can sometimes make me prickly, to put it mildly; I've noticed an abundance of technology usually messes me up more--whether it's the dopamine levels issue or just generally feeling isolated sometimes, tech is usually the thing that sets me off balance if I'm on a procarious edge. Anyway, I first disconnected by deleting Snapchat because it messed with my mental health and made me question self-worth a little. Not in a... oh, do I matter? Kinda way, but more like, I'd always get excited by a notification and then become immediately disheartened as soon as I realise no one wanted to ""speak"" or ""say something"" to me, they were just keeping their streak. And once I left the group chat, I tried to plan things with each member old school: SMS and phonecalls. But we all work (we're in that weird mid-way of past early twenties but nowhere near where TV said we'd be approaching our mid thirties) or have school, so obviously it was hard to plan stuff because people were either tired, spending time with their partners or didn't get back to me. Usually I always reached out, but I accepted it at first as being ""comeuppance"" for leaving the group chat--where communication is more instantaneous. 

Anyway, not to get into too much drama, but I started drifting from one friend in the early stages of my disconnect more than others because I was getting fatigued by her constant self-criticsm and negative anecdotes during most of our hangouts. We fought and in an attempt to open lines of communication and see if we could hangout without buffers or distracts around us, I planned an outing with her; I decided to take her to get ""fancy"" bras--something I'd been planning to do with her since she started complaining about back pain from her bras. The bras are not really fancy, they're just not cheap so I offered to go halves and only took her during sales; they are both durable and pretty (I'm one of those annoying people that loves to share in a good product when I find one because I know how life changing the right pair of shoes or a perfect fitting bra with no padding can be for posture and comfort!). Anyway, after she got sized and bought a pair and posted online about how much a good bra could help with back posture and neck pain, she thanked me and then never reached ot to plan another date. (I'm the kind of person who, if I plan a hangout or teach out, I appreciate if you do the next round. When she didn't, I assumed she was done with me, so I didn't reach out either). 

Now, fast forward a bit: I reach out to one of the friends I considered a best friend. I tell her I miss her and that I'm hurt by the fact that I'm the only one who's ever trying to plan an outing for us, or asking how she's doing or trying to see what fun activities we can do. And even though she said she missed me too and wasn't actively ""not reaching out"", I still wound up being stuck in the same cycle--except when she'd invite me to group activities, like her birthday celebration. (I obviously showed up for it, and made sure to leave all my baggage at the door, I won her prizes at the skiball mini games! But after that weekend, again, no outreach from her end to hang out with ""me"", alone, sans a buffer or group activity, like we used to do). During this time, I noticed everyone's Bitmoji would always pair up or be in vicinity of each other, and sometimes this would happen after I'd tell her I had the day off that week if she wanted to hang--usually she'd forget this, and I was okay with that, but one day I actively invited her to join me in the park, where I'd be reading and drinking a beer for a few hours to enjoy the sun, and she said she couldn't because she'd be tired from work and would go home, then, an hour later, her Bitmoji is with another friends, and I teased her about going out for cocktails with one of our friends when she was supposed to be resting, but then I realised that wasn't what I wanted to say, and tried to express that I was rather hurt she didn't think to even check if I was still in the city, nearby, and willing to join them. She said it wasn't intentional, that she forgot, and then it hit me: thinking about me wasn't an intent. That's how it came off. I was now this friend that annoys you to hang out but who you don't consider or think about as soon as we stop texting. That's probably not how she meant it, but that's kind of worse. To contextualise why this hurt me: I have a freakishly good memory for conversations; if you tell me something about yourself, an story from work or something new hobby, I'll remember it 9/10 times. I got used to my friends not having the same memory, often having to listen to their stories again and again and pretend they're new--to a point. I'm used to people spacing out when I talk about things I'm passionate about because I have ADHD and can talk for eons about the things I love or the whacky facts I keep stored in my brain. I'm a large personality at times, and sometimes I like being taken seriously, but I also know the attention span issue, the phone addiction issue, so I often tried to brush off a ""huh?"" or ""I don't remember this"" or that brief period of silence where someone checks their phone because it's not on silent mode (which my phone is always on, I don't understand the need to always be aware of a notification or update or email, but that's also because I've been an assistant before, I've handled a social media account for a company before--i know how overwhelming having 3 emails and a bajillion software update notifications is like). Suffice to say, the reason I deleted Snapchat was because I hated being aware of everyone's position relative to my own and yet never get asked to join any of them when they bundled up. After this, I try to take her out on the town, but it didn't feel right. She had a bad day, was late to our dinner and I told her to go hkome and rest; I was gonna have a drink by myself instead, I'm usually okay with doing things on my own--as I've had to be, otherwise I'd never do anything besides be on my phone or watch TV or play video games or go to work. I think she felt bad because she decided to hang out with me, but something was off. We both had one drink each, but she didn't feel present. I can't explain it, but it was like trying to connect with someone in detention but they've got narcolepsy! (I know she was probably feeling bad for being an hour late to our dinner, but I'm used to everyone being late to everything, so it didn't bother me as much--it bothered me more that she deprived herself if sleep to hang out with me, but in a way that wasn't fun for either of us really, if I'm being honest). Some good did come of it. She got to rant. I told her about some fun stuff I'd been doing, and I got to try a new restaurant. She tells me she has back pain from her bras too. I get an idea! You might see where this is going...

Then silence again. My birthday comes and goes. Everyone gets the date wrong because my social media accounts have the wrong birthday (a fun joke I run with, one of my accounts says I'm like 80 years old!). Some don't message me, some message me on the wrong date because the app reminded them, and some only message me after I send the obligatory ""thanks for the birthday messages"" message.  (I decided not to stay in the city because I knew no one from the group chat would try to plan something with me and I didn't want to reach out first; it was my birthday, I wanted, again, to be thought of first, not to be a response you can rsvp to). I plan a date a week after, when I know it'll sting less and I'll be more open. Lo and behold, the same bra place has a sale, and just like the friend before, I take her to my trusty bra and lingerie shop. She gets sized. We go halvesies. She finds the bras cute and comfortable. Then, again, no reach out. Except once, when she asks me if I want to join in on a surprise party at 11am for one of the friends in the group chat. That's when I realised, again, that I was simply not ""worth"" the same inclination to be considered as the others were to her. More context: whenever I'd plan a brunch or a park date or anything that took place between 10am-12pm, without fail, every time, people would either not turn up because it was too early, or would arrive late. Always. Once had a brunch go cold for almost 2 hours while we waited for everyone.

The reason Im typing this out instead of trying to sleep for my early shift at work today, is: I passed by another of the group chat friend's' workplace and he told me about the surprise party. He, too, who is always unavailable because he's either working or lives too far out to be tempted to come to the city, went. Yes, the party was important. And I was asked to be a part of it. And I'm glad they were there for each other, but it's odd trying to reconcile the fact that, my relationship to these people revolved around the ease and convenience of a group chat and a snap chat streaks ""game"" to stay relevant. If I don't do the reaching out, I'm forgotten. One of them asked me, in annoyance, when I told them I wasn't ignoring their snaps, I had deleted the app and sent out a notification beforehand, that he didn't know how to reach me. Mind you, he has my phone number. I have his. I sent him an SMS after I said my goodbyes and grabbed the train. 

 Point is, even though it wasn't intended, everyone seems to show up for every other member of the group chat during scenarios that, if they occured during a moment I asked of something, were otherwise regarded as these huge hurdles to get past, but we're relatively a simple ask if it was someone else asking.   

To end on a less somber note: I keep my life moving despite these set backs. I put myself through a summer intensive language course. I'm doing a wine course. I have a writing blog and I write poetry and paint when I can. I have other friends who actively seek me out, randomly, of their own volition, because they thought about me in the moment. I have sports hobbies that can sometimes keep me off my phone and out of my head for a while half a day. I recently saw Materialists in the theatres, by myself, and loved it. I am reading an amazing book by Nawal El Saadawi and ordered my next read, a book by Akala. I'm currently on a mission to find a second hand cd player because I found Skunk Anansie and The Corrs CDs for cheap at a record store I've always wanted to walk into and finally did! And I can now clear 7km at a consistent pace, which leaves only 3km left on my 10k mini marathon dreams. Small strides. And yet, it's still sad. I'm mourning the disconnect from an entire group of friends. But c'est la vie. Though, maybe for next time, if I feel myself drifting apart from a friend who complains about back pain and wears bras, I'll just say ""huh?"" and stare like they spoke to me in french or something.",1,1756520236.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I 22M(264LBS) 5‚Äù6 started my weight loss journey April 1st of 2025. I would confidently say i started off very strict, but to be honest I felt comfortable and knew it was something I could stay on. I stuck to a 600 calorie a day budget and was burning around 3500-4500 cal just by exercise(jump roping for 3-9 hours)  and ~7k total each day. I would stick to the calorie intake with a chicken bowl from chipotle and a large Diet Coke. 

The first month I lost 26 pounds, and second month(were I gave up) I lost 18 pounds. While I didn‚Äôt quite because I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore, I felt defeated because in my head I was aiming for a 35-40 pound-=120 in 3 months. I understand what this is, which is why I put it in the title but at the end of the day I just want the body I can actually look at In the mirror without feeling resentment. 

I can actually pinpoint the exact date that I gave up, as the week leaving up to it I was actually intentionally burning more calories to compensate for the occasion. I was going on a 3 day vacation with family and didn‚Äôt want them to know I was dieting, but despite not having cravings or urges, I for whatever reason indulged in foods I didn‚Äôt even want. 

By the time I got back I started keeping track of calories I would tell myself I would burn the next day, only to not meet the goal: or not any and eventually I had a debt of 200k calories I wouldn‚Äôt ever burn. 

Now it‚Äôs almost 6 months and I feel like I don‚Äôt have the same energy even though I still have the same goal. 

One thing that I have kept is I(for the most part) don‚Äôt drink any calories anymore, I gave up sodas all together for almost 2 months, and only went back for reasons I still don‚Äôt know, as again I had no cravings. But now I still drink diet and zero coke, water, and venti sunsera blonde roast(28cal). This past week I started drinking high calories blended lates from a local coffee shop and am trying to get off of that as it is a craving at the moment. 

*with all that said, what are supplements or small things that will boost calories burned or lower whatever is needed to boost the process. with my new job I won‚Äôt be able to incorporate exercise into my diet but am relying on just the calories burned from daily tasks(~1500).

I've started doing this thing where I get my photo taken a few times a year. It's been the best idea I've had. I'm never the friend to ask my friends to take pictures of me and I always forget anyways. last year I realized I literally had no idea how I looked, so I started getting my photo taken. It's fun, it's a ""me day"", and it helps me look back at my eras LOL

I do NOT need a professional. actually, I am looking for someone with more of a natural and candid style. I prefer when pictures look the absolute most effortless, like I literally prefer iPhone and digital camera (I have one you can use if you don't have one!). I do not need a LinkedIn profile. this is for me! a little direction is nice, I totally don't mind if I look weird and you need me to change pose haha.

for the record I am no model at all. I'm short and my face is round and I have a normal job, as I mentioned this is more for an internal project! I've always been an artistic person so making an album around myself has been very connecting :-) I also work in fashion marketing, so having an updated picture of myself on social media is important since a lot of colleagues use Instagram.

also, like I said I am not a model and do lightly edit my pics. working in fashion, even my influencer and model friends do it, please don't judge! I really try to keep it subtle, whether it's my under-eyes or my short chin I will have something I want to tinker.

the usual rate I've done in the past is about $75 for the hour, and that could include like 1-3 locations, maybe an outfit change. I'd love to know your rate and maybe we can find a match. I try to keep everything within the same area to make it easier for both of us :-) totally don't mind grabbing us coffee before. x

Alt text: Business people in a professional meeting, reflecting Bahrain's corporate environment. 2025 Gulf report, Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil sector is expected to grow 4.1% annually, outpacing GCC rivals. Startups benefit from forward-thinking regulation, world-class digital infrastructure (Bahrain Bay‚Äôs data centers are legendary), and a thriving investor scene fueled by Tamkeen grants and EDB incentives.\
Importantly, the government‚Äôs drive to create an e-commerce powerhouse‚Äîsee the 2025 update to the Electronic Transactions Law‚Äîhas made the Kingdom an obvious base for regional online business, especially for entrepreneurs seeking 99% foreign ownership (read more about ownership rules).\
For a detailed primer on the formation process: Company Formation in Bahrain.\
Core Policies Required on a Bahrain E-Commerce Website\
Every e-commerce site operating in Bahrain‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre trading from Bahrain Financial Harbour or a desk in Amwaj Islands‚Äîmust clearly display the following policies according to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT), the Bahrain Personal Data Protection Law, and the latest 2025 E-Commerce Regulations.\
1. Terms and Conditions (User Agreement)\
Why it matters:\
The Terms and Conditions set out the contract between your business and the customer. Bahrain‚Äôs courts‚Äîespecially the Commercial Court in the Diplomatic Area‚Äîexpect explicit user consent for online contracts.\
Mandated content:\
  - Detailed description of company services/products\
  - Clear payment terms (currency, timelines)\
  - Return/refund procedures\
  - Limitation of liability (as per Bahraini Civil Code)\
  - User rights and obligations\
Personal tip:\
Add a timestamped version history, as I learned during a Tamkeen audit‚Äîalways keep past policy versions accessible for at least 2 years.\
2. Privacy Policy\
Why it matters:\
Following the Bahrain Personal Data Protection Law (Law No. 30 of 2018), all e-commerce sites must explain how personal data is collected, used, stored, and protected.\
Required disclosures:\
  - What data is collected and why (email, phone, payment info)\
  - Whether data is stored in Bahrain or overseas (required for cross-border data transfers‚Äîclarified in 2025 amendments)\
  - User rights regarding data access, correction, and deletion\
  - Security measures (SSL, encryption, etc.)\
  - Contact details for data queries\
Challenge I faced:\
Initially missed the 72-hour breach notification clause. After a painful phone call with a MOICT officer, I implemented real-time data incident alerts tied to our site‚Äôs admin dashboard‚Äîsaved us from a compliance penalty during last year‚Äôs random inspection.\
3. Refund and Return Policy\
Why it matters:\
Bahrain‚Äôs Consumer Protection Law (2023) now mandates specific refund windows and standardizes how return logistics are presented online.\
Must include:\
  - Timeframes for returns (e.g., ‚ÄúWithin 14 days of delivery‚Äù)\
  - Eligible goods/services (not all are refundable)\
  - Step-by-step process for customers\
  - Estimated refund timelines\
  - Contact methods for queries\
\
Surprisingly, having a detailed, multi-lingual return policy in both Arabic and English reduced customer support tickets by 23%‚Äîan insight I picked up from a friendly competitor during a majlis-style business lunch in Adliya.\
\
4. Shipping and Delivery Policy\
Why it matters:\
Under 2025 updates, you must set clear local and international delivery terms to minimize disputes‚Äîand MOICT checks for this during Sijilat renewal.\
Include:\
  - Shipping costs (with BHD breakdowns)\
  - Estimated delivery timelines (specify for GCC, MENA, global)\
  - Partner courier details (Aramex, Bahrain Post, etc.)\
  - Order tracking process\
Pro tip:\
Always list alternative delivery methods during Ramadan‚Äîmany couriers operate with reduced hours. I recommend using both a national and a private courier partner.\
5. Payment Policy\
Why it matters:\
The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) mandates clarity on all payment channels, especially if you offer Buy Now Pay Later or crypto payments (per 2025 CBB circular).\
List:\
  - Accepted payment methods (Visa, Mastercard, BenefitPay, etc.)\
  - Security protocols (PCI DSS, fraud checks)\
  - Billing currency\
  - Payment failure and chargeback process\
Side note:\
Sites registered with Bahrain‚Äôs Sijilat enjoy seamless integration with BenefitPay‚Äîjust be certain to display all applicable payment fees upfront to avoid CBB investigations.\
6. Contact Information & Business Identity Disclosure\
Why it matters:\
MOICT‚Äôs 2025 directive requires full legal identity transparency for all e-commerce operators, including foreign-owned entities.\
Mandatory details:\
  - Registered company name and CR (Commercial Registration) number\
  - Physical address (even if you operate 100% virtually‚Äîuse your office building‚Äôs virtual address or co-working space credentials)\
  - Email and phone\
  - Name of director(s) or responsible manager\
I once neglected to update our new Bahrain Bay office address on-site‚Äîa minor oversight that almost stalled our Sijilat renewal. Always double-check these details after moving, especially in free zones.\
7. Cookies and Tracking Policy\
Why it matters:\
Aligned with Europe‚Äôs GDPR, Bahrain‚Äôs Personal Data Protection Authority (PDPA) now mandates notification and consent for non-essential cookies.\
Ensure:\
  - Pop-up consent banners\
  - Option to reject non-essential cookies\
  - Cookie duration and purpose statement\
Most sites use auto-generated cookie managers, but I‚Äôve found manual customization‚Äîspecifying tracking cookies from Google Analytics or HubSpot‚Äîimproves both user trust and regulatory compliance.\
Selecting the Right Business Structure for Bahrain E-Commerce\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.: Popular for solo founders\
- With Limited Liability Company (WLL): Preferred by multi-partner ventures\
- Branch of a Foreign Company\
- Bahrain Free Zone Entity**\
Deep dive on structures: Bahrain Business Type Structures\
Tangentially, I once considered launching as an SPC for speed but switched to a WLL after realizing it gave us stronger banking partnerships‚Äîcrucial for negotiating lower merchant fees.\
WLLs also mean easier accounting (find out why) and broader investor appeal.\
Step-By-Step Guidance: Saving Time, Money, and Hassle\
1. Choose Your Business District\
!(\
Avoid crowded MOICT counters by registering in Bahrain Bay‚Äîyou‚Äôll breeze through document verification.\
Best office options for e-commerce:\
\
Seef District: Fastest Sijilat processing times.\
Bahrain Bay: Strongest digital infrastructure.\
Amwaj Islands: Popular for digital nomad founders.\
Diplomatic Area: Direct access to regulatory ministries.\
\
\
And if you‚Äôre registering during Ramadan, plan for shorter business hours‚Äîmost government offices close by 2pm. (I once had to return three separate days before learning this the hard way.)\
\
2. Prepare and Submit Core Documents\
Shortcuts that work:\
- Pre-fill all Sijilat forms online and bring digital USB copies (MOICT officers appreciate this and often expedite your turn)\
- Use the Keylink process guide for a checklist\
Documents needed:\
- Completed Sijilat application\
- MOICT-approved business plan\
- Office lease or virtual address proof\
- Copies of passports/CPR for all owners\
- Incorporation articles and KYC forms\
Insider tip:\
Schedule your Sijilat appointment for 9:30am Tuesday‚Äîmidweek, mid-morning slots see the shortest queues. (I learned this from a Tamkeen advisor over cardamom coffee in Seef.)\
3. Secure Commercial Registration & Bank Account\
Detailed requirements here‚Äîbut don‚Äôt forget, as of 2025, almost all banks now require a physical office address (even if virtual) for e-commerce merchant accounts.\
4. Apply for E-Commerce License + LMRA (Labor Market Regulatory Authority)\
LMRA now processes e-commerce-related work permits faster if you submit your policy drafts in English and Arabic with your license application.\
Common mistake:\
Drafting policies last-minute. Prepare full compliance documents during formation. This saves 2-4 weeks.\
5. Activate Tamkeen or EDB Support\
If eligible, Tamkeen offers subsidies for first-year office rent or website build costs‚Äîapply immediately after receiving your CR.\

\
Comparing to UAE and Saudi Arabia:\
Fewer restrictions, faster CR processing, and much lower setup costs.\
And Bahrain‚Äôs majlis-style networking‚Äîover Arabic coffee, after Friday prayers‚Äîopens more doors than any corporate networking night in Dubai.\
Bahrain Business Culture: Quirks and Insider Tips\
Surprisingly, success in Bahrain isn‚Äôt just about paperwork; it‚Äôs also about understanding local customs:\
\
Hand business cards with your right hand and always greet with a smile‚Äîrelationships matter more than you expect.\
Majlis meetings (traditional sitting rooms): crucial for B2B deals; expect strong coffee and open conversation.\
During Ramadan, business hours shift‚Äîuse early morning slots for important meetings as afternoons are reserved for family and rest.\
\
(My direct experience: closing a major logistics partnership in the MOICT building during the last week of Ramadan, when everyone else had given up. Patience and cultural awareness pay off financially.)\
FAQ: Bahrain E-Commerce Policies and Company Formation\
Q1: Can I fully own an e-commerce business as a foreigner in Bahrain?\
Absolutely. For most e-commerce activities, you can own 99-100%‚Äîno local sponsor required. Read more at 100% Foreign Ownership in Bahrain.\
Q2: What happens if I don‚Äôt properly display a required policy?\
MOICT can issue warnings, fines (200‚Äì1,000 BHD), or even temporarily block your site. I recommend quarterly audits and using the Keylink Bahrain Company Formation Process guide for compliance.\
Q3: What‚Äôs the best time of year to launch an e-commerce site in Bahrain?\
Avoid launching right before or during Ramadan unless you can staff for short working hours and reduced government support. October through January sees the smoothest licensing and customer onboarding.\
Q4: Are there any local content or language requirements?\
Yes, all core policies must be available in both Arabic and English. Use professional translators‚ÄîMOICT checks for accuracy.\
Q5: Who can help draft and review my site policies?\
I recommend working with a Bahrain-based legal consultant familiar with e-commerce laws (ask for MOICT references). Keylink and EDB both maintain vetted lists.\

1n3ppxp,https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/trump-tariffs-higher-prices-forecast-5233d6c4?st=GGGcV1,Higher Prices Are Coming for Household Staples,"U.S. companies including Hormel Foods, J.M. Smucker, and Ace Hardware are alerting consumers to forthcoming price increases, attributing much of the pressure to rising meat costs and tariffs under the Trump administration. Retail giants like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy confirm that some price hikes are already in effect and more are expected to follow. The combined impact of supply constraints and trade-related levies is driving up the costs of a variety of essentials, including beef, pork, coffee, nuts, and vegetables. 

Restaurants and food chains are also adjusting to higher input costs, with outlets like Texas Roadhouse are raising their prices on their menus. 

This tariff policy directly raises the cost of everyday essentials like food, household goods, and basic retail items at a time when many families are already strained by inflation. Tariffs and supply issues drive up production and import costs, and companies pass those expenses on to consumers through higher prices. That means groceries, restaurant meals, and home goods become more expensive, reducing purchasing power and stretching family budgets thinner. Lower- and middle-income households are hit hardest since they spend a larger portion of their income on necessities.

Weve been through a LOT, and have 2 kids together. Its been very rocky for most of our time together. There has been cheating on his part(not physical according to him. But found a pic on his phone of his best friends gfs vag. Then found out through google maps that he spent over an hour at her house the same night this pic was sent. LONG story on its own there), lots of lying and secrets, sneaking off to strip clubs, porn addiction, tried to leave me for a coffee barista at the coffee shop he frequented, flirtatious with co workers, long phone conversations with co workers behind my back, the list goes on. But he always leads me to believe that I'm 'crazy"" or overreacting to these situations. We've argued about him constantly looking at other women(online and IRL), and he says ""well if they're hot I'm gonna look"" or ""its a guy thing. We all do it"". Porn wasn't an issue with me for a long time, until I realized it was an addiction. Watching it at work, driving down the road, sitting in parking lots, even in the doctors office while sitting in the room waiting to be seen. And now i feel very negatively about it. So it causes a lot of arguments, and makes me feel terrible about myself and makes sex just not very enjoyable for me anymore. I have a pretty nice body for having kids and all and im ""pretty"", but I feel almost humiliated when he looks at me naked now. Which sucks for me, because I love sex. I truly do, but his porn addiction/obsession with other women has ruined it for me. He's proven a million times he won't ever stop, so atp I either have to get over it or just leave him. The answer might seem obvious to some people, but I look at some of these other men out here and what they do and think to myself "" well i really could be with someone so much worse. Maybe this isn't that bad, and i AM overreacting/need to chill"". But then I also think.""theres no way in HELL, any woman would put up with what I have"". And as I stated, we also have 2 kids together. From the beginning he always said ""I always want our kids to always have both mom and dad together"", so ive always tried to keep us together for that reason. Our kids. Now he lost his job 3 months ago, and since then has become addicted to a video game. He's on it from the time he wakes up until he goes to sleep at night(and only sleeps for 3-4 hours at night then right back to it). Which leaves me to do EVERYTHING.Literally. I asked him to the mow the lawn shortly after he became unemployed. Im a smaller person and we have a a push mower (not self propelled), with a steep hill in the front of our yard. I'm a smaller person, so its difficult for me to do it. And to top it off...ive never used a push mower in my life. Lol. We always had bigger yards, so ive only ever used a rider. Well it sat un-mowed up until 4 days ago when I got sick of looking at it and decided to just do it myself. All while he just played video games. He knew I was doing it, and offered no help at all. I came in frustrated after it died out on me and I couldnt get it started. He says ""well try this or this"". And thats it. I got it started and a neighbor guy came over and offered to help with the rest. You could tell he felt bad, but i turned away the help because i didn't want to upset my partner. But everything is on me since hes been out of work. I have a lot of health issues, so the extra physical and mental stress is not good for my conditions. And with his new found gaming addiction, I feel like i dont get any kind of support or love from him. I'm ignored all day while his headset is glued on and hes just taking with these random people all day. The only time I get any acknowledgement is when he wants sex. And now that thats been ruined by his obsession with porn and other women, its like...whats really left here? We don't go out together, he complains if i make any plans(not just dates. But going ANYWHERE because he just wants to sit at home), he doesn't do romantic or nice things for me. Ive told him how i feel about everything, but nothing ever changes. When we argue he says things that make me feel like i dont do anything right in his eyes. We fight and he says or does horrible things, and then gets mad that I dont hug all over him and baby him and apologize after a fight. I think that's the last thing anyone wants to do after their partner sits there and belittles them, and calls them names like ""stupid dumb ass b*tch"" for an hour. But the crazy thing is...when i think about leaving him, it makes me really really sad. I guess this post has turned into me mostly venting, but im also curious how other people see it.

## The Invisible Problem That's Everywhere üëª

We've all encountered them. The colleague who nods along in meetings but contributes nothing. The family member who's physically present but emotionally absent. The team member who's become a human paperweight. They're not openly hostile or disruptive ‚Äì they've just... switched off.

This phenomenon cuts across every environment: boardrooms, living rooms, classrooms, and friend groups. It's the person who's stopped caring, stopped trying, and stopped engaging. They've become what we might call ""the numb member"" ‚Äì present in body but absent in spirit.

## Why People Go Numb üßä

Before we dive into solutions, let's understand the root causes. People don't usually start out disengaged. Something pushes them there:

**Overwhelm and Burnout** üî•
When demands consistently exceed capacity, the brain's defense mechanism kicks in: shutdown mode. It's like a circuit breaker protecting the system from overload.

**Feeling Invisible or Unheard** üó£Ô∏è
After repeatedly sharing ideas that get ignored or dismissed, many people simply stop speaking up. Why waste energy on deaf ears?

**Lack of Purpose or Direction** üéØ
Without clear understanding of how their role matters, people drift into autopilot. They show up because they have to, not because they want to.

**Past Disappointments** üíî
Previous experiences of being let down, passed over, or betrayed create protective walls. Numbness becomes armor against future hurt.

**Mismatched Expectations** ‚öñÔ∏è
When reality doesn't align with what someone expected from a job, relationship, or situation, disillusionment sets in.

## The Hidden Cost of Ignoring the Problem üí∏

That checked-out person isn't just neutral ‚Äì they're actively draining energy from the group. Their disengagement:

- Creates extra work for others who must compensate
- Spreads like a virus, affecting group morale
- Reduces overall productivity and creativity
- Generates frustration and resentment
- Blocks potential breakthrough moments

Ignoring them hoping they'll ""snap out of it"" rarely works. Like a leak in a boat, small problems become big ones when left unaddressed.

## The Universal Recovery Method üîÑ

Here's a step-by-step approach that works whether you're dealing with a spouse, employee, teenager, or friend:

### Step 1: Create Safe Space for Honest Conversation üõ°Ô∏è

Choose a private, comfortable setting. Start with something like:
""I've noticed you seem less engaged lately. I care about you and want to understand what's going on.""

Avoid accusatory language like ""You never participate"" or ""You don't seem to care."" Instead, use observational statements about their behavior patterns.

### Step 2: Listen Without Fixing üëÇ

This is crucial. Your instinct might be to immediately offer solutions, but first, they need to feel heard. Ask open-ended questions:
- ""What's been on your mind lately?""
- ""How are you feeling about [specific situation]?""
- ""What would need to change for you to feel more excited about this?""

Listen for underlying themes: stress, confusion, feeling undervalued, or lack of challenge.

### Step 3: Acknowledge Their Perspective ü§ù

Validate their feelings without necessarily agreeing with their conclusions. Say things like:
""That sounds frustrating"" or ""I can see why that would be discouraging.""

This isn't about right or wrong ‚Äì it's about understanding their internal experience.

### Step 4: Identify Specific Blockers üöß

Work together to pinpoint exact obstacles. Instead of vague complaints like ""nothing matters,"" drill down:
- What specific tasks feel pointless?
- Which interactions leave them drained?
- What would a good day look like to them?

### Step 5: Co-Create Small Wins üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Don't try to solve everything at once. Pick one or two manageable changes that could restore some sense of progress or control:
- Adjusting their role or responsibilities
- Providing new learning opportunities
- Changing how feedback is given
- Setting different expectations

### Step 6: Establish Check-In Rhythms üìÖ

Schedule regular brief conversations to monitor progress. This shows ongoing investment in their wellbeing and prevents backsliding.

## Tailoring the Approach by Context üé®

### In the Workplace üíº
Focus on role clarity, skill development, and recognition. Ask about career goals and how current work connects to future aspirations. Consider task rotation or special projects that reignite interest.

### In Families üè†
Emphasize connection over correction. Family members who've gone numb often feel taken for granted. Show appreciation for small contributions and create opportunities for meaningful interaction.

### In Friendships üë´
Numb friends might be overwhelmed by life circumstances. Offer practical support alongside emotional encouragement. Sometimes they need permission to step back temporarily rather than pressure to engage more.

### On Teams or in Groups ü§ù
Look for ways to give them ownership over something meaningful. People re-engage when they feel essential rather than expendable.

## What NOT to Do ‚ùå

**Don't Take It Personally** 
Their disengagement usually isn't about you, even if it affects you directly.

**Don't Use Guilt or Pressure**
Statements like ""Everyone else manages just fine"" or ""You're letting the team down"" typically backfire, pushing them deeper into withdrawal.

**Don't Ignore Clear Boundaries**
If someone says they need space or time, respect that. Forced engagement rarely produces lasting results.

**Don't Assume Motivation**
Avoid deciding why they're disengaged without asking. Your assumptions might be completely wrong.

## Advanced Strategies for Persistent Cases üî¨

### The Rotation Method
Sometimes people are numb because they're bored. Systematically rotate their responsibilities or environment to find what sparks interest.

### The Contribution Audit
Help them identify and articulate their unique value. Often disengaged people have lost sight of how they matter.

### The Energy Mapping Exercise
Work with them to identify what activities give versus drain energy, then restructure their involvement accordingly.

### The Future Self Conversation
Ask them to describe what they want their situation to look like in six months, then work backward to identify necessary steps.

## Prevention is Better Than Cure üõ°Ô∏è

### Regular Temperature Checks
Don't wait for someone to go numb. Regularly ask people in your circles how they're feeling about their roles and relationships.

### Recognize Early Warning Signs
Watch for decreased participation, shortened responses, missed opportunities for input, or changes in body language during group interactions.

### Create Multiple Pathways for Engagement
Not everyone engages the same way. Some prefer small group discussions over large meetings. Others need time to process before contributing.

### Celebrate Incremental Improvements
When someone starts re-engaging, acknowledge it. This reinforces positive changes and encourages continued progress.

## When to Accept Limitations ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, someone may choose to remain disengaged. This might happen because:
- They're dealing with personal issues beyond your ability to address
- The environment genuinely isn't a good fit for them
- They're in a temporary life phase requiring different priorities
- They have different values or goals than the group

In these cases, focus on managing the impact on others while treating the disengaged person with dignity and respect.

## The Ripple Effect of Re-engagement üåä

When you successfully help someone move from numbness to active participation, the benefits multiply:

**For Them:**
- Restored sense of purpose and energy
- Improved relationships and opportunities
- Better mental and emotional wellbeing
- Renewed confidence in their abilities

**For the Group:**
- Increased collective intelligence and creativity
- Better morale and atmosphere
- More distributed workload
- Enhanced problem-solving capacity

**For You:**
- Stronger leadership or relationship skills
- Reduced stress from compensating for others
- Satisfaction from helping someone grow
- A more positive environment for everyone

## Making It Sustainable üå±

The goal isn't to artificially inflate someone's engagement temporarily ‚Äì it's to help them find genuine reasons to care again. This requires:

**Patience with the Process**
Real change takes time. Don't expect overnight transformations.

**Consistency in Support**
Follow through on commitments made during recovery conversations.

**Flexibility in Methods**
What works for one person may not work for another. Stay adaptable.

**Long-term Perspective**
Focus on building lasting motivation rather than quick fixes.

## Your Action Plan Starting Today üìã

1. **Identify** one person in your circle who seems disengaged
2. **Schedule** a private conversation with them this week
3. **Listen** more than you talk during that conversation
4. **Collaborate** on identifying one small change to try
5. **Follow up** within a week to see how it's going

Remember: every numb person was once enthusiastic about something. Your role is to help them rediscover that spark, not to force artificial enthusiasm.

The methodology outlined here isn't just theory ‚Äì it's a practical approach that recognizes human nature's complexity while providing concrete steps forward. Whether you're managing a team, raising a family, or maintaining friendships, these principles will serve you well.

The best part? These skills become stronger with practice. Each person you help re-engage teaches you something new about human motivation and resilience. You're not just solving immediate problems ‚Äì you're building capabilities that will serve every relationship in your life.

Start with one conversation. Choose one person. Take one small step.

The transformation might surprise you both. üöÄ

well, just the other day I was walking back up the street to my house. A older male came riding down the street on his bike. His bike has a small to medium black crate attached on the back. He also, if I remember correctly had a gray or dark colored shirt with some type of logo on it. Maybe what? Maybe? He was definitely older, gray hair old.

 I‚Äôm a quite literally maybe one or two houses from my own. He stops to ask me something along the lines of. If I‚Äôve seen his cat named sugar and or if I could help him to find his cat. I might‚Äôve said no? But I mostly just remained silent and shook my head. I walked past him on the way to my house. He starts calling out for his supposed cat named sugar. From the middle of the street into the direction of my childhood friend‚Äôs backyard. 

He must‚Äôve ridden off on his back after I went inside. I personally haven‚Äôt seen him since. But my sister-in-law‚Äôs best friend who was taking my niece and nephew to an after school event at their school up the street. Came, picked them up, and drove them to and back. At some point she had also noticed the same guy riding around on his bike slowly in front the school.

We've all encountered them - those individuals who seem immune to appreciation. Whether it's a family member who never acknowledges your help, a colleague who takes credit without thanks, or a team member who acts entitled to everyone's efforts. Dealing with ungrateful people can drain your energy and leave you questioning your own generosity.

## Understanding the Psychology Behind Ingratitude üß†

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to understand why some people struggle with gratitude. Often, ungrateful behavior stems from:

**Deep-seated insecurity** - Some individuals feel acknowledging help makes them appear weak or dependent.

**Learned patterns** - Those raised in environments where appreciation wasn't modeled may struggle to express gratitude naturally.

**Overwhelming circumstances** - People dealing with stress, depression, or major life challenges might become so focused on their problems that they lose sight of others' contributions.

**Entitlement mindset** - Some believe they deserve help without needing to reciprocate appreciation.

Understanding these root causes doesn't excuse the behavior, but it helps you approach the situation with clarity rather than personal frustration.

## The Mirror Principle: Setting Boundaries Without Burning Bridges ü™û

The most effective approach involves what I call the ""Mirror Principle"" - reflecting back the energy and effort you receive while maintaining your own integrity.

### Step 1: Document and Observe üìù

Start keeping a mental or written record of interactions. Notice patterns:
- How often does this person acknowledge help?
- Do they show appreciation to others but not you?
- Are there specific triggers that worsen their ungrateful behavior?

This observation phase prevents you from making emotional decisions and helps you see the situation objectively.

### Step 2: Calibrate Your Investment ‚öñÔ∏è

Match your energy output to their appreciation level. This doesn't mean becoming petty or vindictive. Instead:

**For family members**: Maintain basic respect and necessary communication, but reduce voluntary favors and extra efforts until you see positive changes.

**For colleagues**: Focus on professional obligations while limiting additional support that goes unacknowledged.

**For team members**: Ensure equal treatment and avoid giving special advantages to those who don't recognize contributions.

## The Graduated Response System üìà

Implement changes gradually to give people opportunities to adjust their behavior:

### Level 1: The Gentle Nudge
Begin by explicitly stating your contributions when appropriate. Instead of hoping they'll notice, say things like:
- ""I'm glad I could help you with that project deadline""
- ""I hope the extra hours I put in made a difference""

This gives them a chance to respond with gratitude they might not have thought to express.

### Level 2: The Direct Conversation
If subtle approaches fail, have an honest discussion. Choose a calm moment and express your feelings without attacking their character:

""I've noticed that when I help with tasks, there's often no acknowledgment. I don't need elaborate thanks, but some recognition would help me feel valued as a team member.""

### Level 3: The Natural Consequences
If direct communication doesn't work, let natural consequences occur. This means:
- Not volunteering for extra duties that benefit them
- Allowing them to experience the full weight of their responsibilities
- Redirecting your helpful energy toward appreciative people

## Practical Daily Strategies üí™

### The 24-Hour Rule ‚è∞
When someone fails to show gratitude, wait 24 hours before reacting. Often, initial frustration clouds judgment. After a day, you can respond more thoughtfully.

### The Energy Audit üîã
Weekly, assess where your energy goes. Ask yourself:
- Which relationships energize me?
- Where am I giving more than I receive?
- How can I redirect effort toward mutual relationships?

### The Appreciation Circle üîÑ
Surround yourself with people who value reciprocal appreciation. This isn't about creating an echo chamber, but ensuring you have relationships that refuel your capacity to give.

## Communication Techniques That Work üó£Ô∏è

### The ""When-Then"" Framework
Instead of ultimatums, use conditional statements:
""When I see that my contributions are valued, then I feel motivated to continue helping.""

### The Positive Reinforcement Method
When ungrateful people do show appreciation (even minimally), acknowledge it immediately:
""I really appreciate you saying thank you. It makes working together much more enjoyable.""

### The Boundary Statement
Be clear about your limits without being aggressive:
""I'm happy to help when I can, but I need to prioritize my time for projects where I feel my efforts are recognized.""

## Long-term Relationship Management üèóÔ∏è

### Family Dynamics
Family relationships require special consideration since you can't simply cut ties. Focus on:
- Maintaining basic respect and love while adjusting expectations
- Creating traditions that encourage gratitude (without being preachy)
- Modeling appreciative behavior consistently
- Having frank conversations about family values and mutual respect

### Workplace Situations
Professional environments offer more clear-cut boundaries:
- Document your contributions for performance reviews
- Communicate achievements to supervisors when colleagues don't acknowledge them
- Build alliances with appreciative team members
- Focus on projects where your efforts are recognized

### Friend Groups and Social Circles
With friends, you have the most freedom to adjust relationships:
- Gradually reduce investment in one-sided friendships
- Be honest about your needs in relationships
- Seek out new connections with people who share your values
- Don't be afraid to let some friendships fade naturally

## The Self-Care Component üíö

Dealing with ungrateful people can be emotionally exhausting. Protect your well-being by:

### Regular Gratitude Practice
Keep a personal gratitude journal. This reminds you of positive aspects in your life and prevents you from becoming bitter.

### Celebrating Your Own Achievements
Don't wait for others to recognize your worth. Acknowledge your own accomplishments and treat yourself with the appreciation you deserve.

### Seeking Supportive Communities
Join groups, clubs, or online communities where mutual appreciation is the norm. This helps restore your faith in human decency.

### Professional Support When Needed
If dealing with ungrateful people is affecting your mental health, consider speaking with a counselor or therapist. They can provide personalized strategies for your specific situation.

## What Not to Do ‚ùå

Avoid these common mistakes that often backfire:

**Don't become vengeful** - Seeking revenge typically escalates conflicts and reflects poorly on your character.

**Don't martyr yourself** - Continuing to give endlessly while complaining about lack of appreciation helps no one.

**Don't gossip about them** - Talking negatively about ungrateful people to others often creates more drama.

**Don't mirror their behavior** - Becoming ungrateful yourself doesn't solve the problem and compromises your values.

**Don't assume they're hopeless** - People can change, but change must come from them, not your efforts to force it.

## Measuring Success üìä

Track your progress by monitoring:

- **Your stress levels** - Are you feeling less frustrated and more in control?
- **The relationship dynamics** - Have boundaries improved mutual respect?
- **Your energy levels** - Do you feel more balanced in giving and receiving?
- **Overall satisfaction** - Are your relationships becoming more fulfilling?

Success doesn't always mean the other person becomes grateful. Sometimes it means you've learned to protect your well-being while maintaining appropriate relationships.

## Creating a Gratitude Culture üå±

Where possible, help establish environments where appreciation is normalized:

### In Families
- Institute regular ""appreciation rounds"" during family dinners
- Create traditions around thanking each other
- Model gratitude consistently in your own behavior
- Teach children the importance of acknowledgment

### In Workplaces
- Suggest team practices that recognize contributions
- Publicly acknowledge colleagues' efforts
- Advocate for appreciation-based policies
- Lead by example in recognizing others

### In Social Groups
- Be the person who regularly thanks others
- Organize gatherings that celebrate achievements
- Encourage appreciation in group dynamics
- Don't tolerate disrespectful behavior toward others

## The Ripple Effect üåä

When you handle ungrateful people with wisdom rather than resentment, you create positive change that extends beyond immediate relationships. Others observe your approach and often adopt similar strategies. You become a model for healthy boundary-setting and self-respect.

Remember that changing your approach doesn't guarantee others will change, but it ensures you maintain your integrity while protecting your well-being. The goal isn't to punish ungrateful people or force them to appreciate you. It's to create sustainable relationships where mutual respect can flourish.

## Moving Forward with Confidence üöÄ

Dealing with ungrateful people is a universal human challenge that will likely persist throughout your lifetime. The strategies outlined here provide a framework for navigating these relationships while preserving your own mental health and maintaining your generous spirit.

The key is consistency. Apply these principles regularly, adjust them to fit your specific circumstances, and remember that the only person you can truly control is yourself. Focus on building a life filled with mutual appreciation and respect, and you'll find that ungrateful people have much less impact on your overall happiness.

Your time and energy are valuable resources. Invest them wisely in relationships and situations that honor your contributions while maintaining compassion for those still learning how to appreciate others.

1n3p9ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n3p9ua/my_friend_was_a_nightmare_guest_now_she_wants_to/,My friend was a nightmare guest- now she wants to post on social media like we had an amazing time and I can‚Äôt stand it,"Hey all. I‚Äôll try to keep it as brief as possible but I really wanted to get this off my chest.

Over summer, I temporarily relocated to a new city. Now my friend: she‚Äôs a type A, pretty and very socially active woman. She‚Äôs the type who invites like 90 people to her parties and religiously posts on Instagram about everything she‚Äôs up to and likes showing off about little things  (eg. Getting free coffee- she‚Äôll post about it no fail)- she herself recognises that she cannot go about keeping her achievements unaccounted, no matter the scale. Although she has many friends, I‚Äôve known her for a really long time since school. 

She invited herself to a city I‚Äôm at, last minute. I was abit hesitant as I‚Äôm nearing the end of my stay and really wanted some time to myself and to spend time with people I met here, but she pushed the visit as she‚Äôs always wanted to visit here and couldn‚Äôt get time off work other than this. So I agreed and planned out time together and looked forward to it.

Long story short; she was a nightmare. First evening went well, but throughout the stay she expected princess treatment and was inconsiderate- little things like getting really grumpy if I didn‚Äôt help blow dry her hair (she‚Äôd sit in front of the mirror and literally just wait for me), asking me to close the window or get some water in the middle of the night (to which I stayed in bed and she was like ‚Äúoh- you want me to do it‚Äù), and getting into a mood when I had to work from home even though I gave her a clear warning that I cannot take full time off. Even though she couldn‚Äôt wait for me to finish work, she‚Äôd continuously make us late for plans we made because she would take a really long time getting ready, or she‚Äôd get distracted  on her solo walk and not return home for like an hour or two past our agreed time. 

The final straw was at final night, we went out to a nearby club. We were having a good time, and she got flirty with another guy. When we were getting drinks at a very crowded bar area, she literally disappeared: I turned to ask what she wanted and she wasn‚Äôt there- we had come up together minutes before. For abit I presumed she must‚Äôve gone back to the dance floor etc, but I started to panic when I couldn‚Äôt see her and she wasn‚Äôt picking up her calls. I searched through the club as much as I could, asked the staff and smokers outside, but no one saw her. I panicked more as she continued not to pick up her phone. I even ran back to my flat just incase she decided to head there (even though she doesn‚Äôt have my keys) but to no avail. I cried (I was also drunk, which made me more anxious) inside before deciding to head back to the club because I felt like I didn‚Äôt know where else to look. When I was sitting outside feeling horrendous, she finally messaged me asking where I am. I call her and she didn‚Äôt pick up (?). I frantically message her asking her where she‚Äôs been, and that I‚Äôve been out for ages- she ignores and just says ‚Äúwhere are you!!‚Äù. I told her I‚Äôm at the front of the club and she COMES OUT from inside. 
It turns out she went back to the guy‚Äôs flat, had sex, smoked weed, and came back. All whilst ignoring my calls. All this lasted just under three hours. there wasn‚Äôt a single apology, and she even made snide comments about me being too anxious. 

I‚Äôll skip the rest of her trip but Ive been feeling so.. drained. Because of having a guest, but also I think because I don‚Äôt understand how she could be so selfish during her stay- I suddenly didn‚Äôt understand how she has *that* many friends whilst being like this, let alone having being the nice girl of the group. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs been two days and she‚Äôs been prodding me to upload photos I took of her to the shared album. She did keep asking me to take ‚Äúcandids‚Äù (LOTS), and even pre picked out header photos for her planned post. I haven‚Äôt responded to her because I‚Äôve been shutting down, and also have had literal migraine after she left. And to think she‚Äôd post on her social media about her trip and make out as if we had an amazing time (this is the usual nature of her posts) really upsets me. I guess I‚Äôll have to forward them soon but I feel so upset and let down by what I thought was a longstanding friendship. 

I can‚Äôt tell if this is a vent post or if I‚Äôm seeking advice; maybe a bit of both. But thanks so much for reading!",1,1756517813.0,Advice,4,1.0,False
1n3p9dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/meedloyalty/comments/1n3p9dx/why_member_perks_are_your_secret_weapon_for/,Why Member Perks are Your Secret Weapon for Customer Loyalty,"https://preview.redd.it/kdr9s58592mf1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6ed52fb51e6195906407add491c4d31abcaedf

We've all seen it: a customer at the register, about to pay. You gesture to your sleek new QR code and ask, ""Care to join our loyalty program?"" They hesitate, weighing the effort of retrieving their phone against the allure of a future reward. Sometimes they opt in, but often, the response is a polite, ""Perhaps another time.""

What if you could turn that hesitation into instant enthusiasm?

Traditional stamp cards and points systems are great for rewarding long-term loyalty, but they‚Äôre a long game. Customers have to visit and spend multiple times before they see a benefit. But instant gratification is a powerful motivator.

This is where loyalty perks come in. A perk isn‚Äôt something a customer earns over time; it‚Äôs an immediate benefit they get just for being a member. It‚Äôs the secret handshake, the insider benefit, the little bonus that says, ‚ÄúWelcome to the club. We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù

# What‚Äôs the Difference Between a Loyalty Perk and a Reward?

It‚Äôs a simple but crucial distinction. Think of it like this:

* **A Reward**¬†is transactional. It‚Äôs earned after a set number of actions. The classic example is, ‚ÄúBuy nine coffees, get the tenth free.‚Äù It‚Äôs the destination.  
* **A Perk**¬†is relational. It‚Äôs an ongoing benefit of membership. It‚Äôs what you get just for showing your membership pass. It‚Äôs the fun stuff you get to enjoy along the journey.

A great loyalty strategy uses both. The reward gives customers a goal to strive for, while the perks make every visit feel a little more special, thereby strengthening their bond with your business from the very beginning.

# Why Perks Pack Such a Powerful Punch

Offering instant member benefits is one of the most effective ways to get people to scan that QR code. Here‚Äôs why it works so well for independent businesses:

* **Provides Instant Value:**¬†A perk overcomes the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it later‚Äù objection. When a customer knows they‚Äôll receive 10% off their purchase immediately by signing up, the decision becomes a no-brainer.  
* **Fosters a Sense of Belonging:**¬†Phrases like ‚Äúmembers get‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúexclusive to members‚Äù transform your program from a simple marketing tool into a community. People love feeling like they‚Äôre part of an in-the-know group. It fosters an emotional connection that extends beyond mere transactions.  
* **Drives Repeat Business:**¬†An ongoing perk gives customers a reason to choose you over a competitor. ‚ÄúMembers get a free side on Tuesdays‚Äù is a simple yet compelling reason for them to stop by mid-week.  
* **Low-Cost, High-Impact:**¬†Perks don‚Äôt have to break the bank. Many are based on service or convenience rather than cost, but they deliver a considerable amount of goodwill, making your customers feel truly valued.

# Perk Inspiration for Your Independent Business

The best perks are simple, easy to deliver, and genuinely valuable to your customers. Here are some ideas for different sectors to get you started.

# For Restaurants, Cafes, and Takeaways

Food and drink businesses are perfect for perks. Look at **Santa Monica Cantina**¬†in Hong Kong. Any member who shows their pass receives a massive 20% discount on tacos, available every day of the week. That‚Äôs a powerful reason to join and an even better reason to come back!

* **The Welcome Treat:**¬†A free dip with your chips or a complimentary soft drink with your first order as a member.  
* **The Mid-Week Boost:**¬†‚ÄúMember Mondays‚Äù with a free coffee upgrade from medium to large.  
* **The VIP Experience:**¬†Priority booking for popular nights or first access to new seasonal menus.

# For Bars and Pubs

Creating a great atmosphere is key, and perks can make your regulars feel like true locals.   
  


* **The Exclusive Hour:**¬†A members-only happy hour with special prices from 5-6 pm.  
* **The Little Extra:**¬†A complimentary bowl of crisps or nuts with the first round for members.  
* **The Inside Track:**¬†First dibs and a small discount on tickets for the weekly pub quiz or live music nights.

# For Beauty, Hair, and Nail Salons

Your clients come to you to feel good. Perks can enhance that experience and make them feel truly pampered.

* **The Service Upgrade:**¬†A complimentary hand massage with every manicure or a free deep conditioning treatment with any haircut in their birthday month.  
* **The Retail Bonus:**¬†15% off any retail products (like shampoos, lotions, or polishes) at any time.  
* **The Priority Pass:**¬†First access to new appointment slots when your diary opens each month.

# For Studios & Creatives (Tattoo Artists, Fitness, etc.)

Your clients are investing in a skill or art form. Perks can reward their commitment and make them feel part of your creative community.

* **Tattoo Artists:**¬†Offer a free high-quality print of the customer's tattoo design. Give members first look at new flash designs before they‚Äôre released publicly.  
* **Fitness & Yoga Studios:**¬†‚ÄúBring a friend for free‚Äù on the first Friday of every month. Offer free mats or towels for hire for every class.  
* **Pottery Studios:**¬†A free bag of clay per term for members or a 10% discount on firing fees.

# Making it Happen: Perks + meed = A Perfect Match

The beauty of this strategy is its simplicity. With meed, you don‚Äôt need a complex system to manage your perks.

You decide what amazing benefit you want to offer, and your customer‚Äôs meed pass on their phone is their key. They show their pass, and your staff see that they are a member, so they unlock the benefit. It happens in seconds.

This works in conjunction with our digital stamp card feature. So, your customer gets the instant gratification of a perk *and*¬†earns a stamp towards their next big reward. It‚Äôs the perfect combination to build lasting loyalty and keep them coming back for more.

Ready to make your customers feel like the VIPs they are?[¬†](https://portal.meedloyalty.com/)[**Start your free meed loyalty program today**](https://portal.meedloyalty.com/)¬†**and discover how a simple perk can make all the difference.**

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Two months later, I decided I wouldn't look back.

The reason I joined this sub was the accumulation of some intriguing social experiences: today, for example, I had to wait for a few minutes in a reception room. The secretary who greeted me very kindly offered me coffee and some cookies. I just said, ‚ÄúNo, thank you.‚Äù

And she offered it to me AGAIN, and I just repeated the same answer.

Her face completely closed up, as if I had made her uncomfortable. Okay, I remained silent, waiting to be received. Meanwhile, other people arrived, and the secretary offered them all coffee and cookies. EVERYONE, EVERYONE accepted at least the coffee, and the secretary herself poured herself a new cup whenever someone entered the room. At that rate, she must have been drinking 2 liters or more of coffee a day.

This made me wonder: were people consciously or unconsciously committed to ensuring that others had the same vices as them? Was it pure crab mentality, or had they just learned to normalize self-destructive behaviors (which go far beyond coffee consumption)?

Has anyone had similar experiences or asked themselves similar questions?",5,1756517599.0,decaf,5,0.78,False

I miss the screen real estate when I'm on the Macbook, especially when I'm writing a paper / report, or studying for a cert. I'd be ok with going down to one large screen instead of multiples, since that seems to be a sticking point in a lot of the comments here on Viture for productivity.

1n3p6ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1n3p6ig/im_realising_at_40_how_awesome_it_would_be_to_be/,I'm realising at 40 how awesome it would be to be in love,"So, the story is that I grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere and went to an all boys boarding school also in the middle of nowhere.

The only time I was around girls was on my birthdays when my parents friends would bring their daughters. I remember this happening from the age of about 6 to about 11. 

Anyway, I was terrified and shy of girls and used to run away to play on my own on the farm. I was also teased by my Mum and other family members of having a girl friend... I remember crying really hard for being teased (age about 8).

Age 14 and I'm quite a popular guy. I'm in the city with my friends and there's a really pretty girl I keep looking at. Eventually she comes and sits next to me and says ""Hi."" I say ""Hi"" back and stop breathing. I then get up and walk away. 

She ends up getting my number from a friend and starts texting me. Long story short is that I end up developing feelings for her and it doesn't work out. It doesn't turn into anything and I'm heart broken. The pain was so severe that I ended up saying ""Love is useless, I never want to feel love again."" And to this day I haven't. 

So I don't really develop feelings for people. There have been times I started really liking someone but then my mind would go crazy and I would sabotage. That pattern would go on to destroy many potential relationships with women. This only happened if they were attractive and I was into them.

If I wasn't into her I could be myself and many consider me to be quite funny which is true at times. I can be really funny. When I liked a girl, I would be intense...

OK, so, I moved to the UK in 2004 and in about 2006 I decided to figure out how to meet and date women. I threw myself into it. I approached a lot of women and figured out some stuff and ended up having a youtube channel in the top 20 most viewed channels in the UK for a time. I was sharing what I was learning and apparently there was a lot of other people who were very interested. 

I started doing live workshops where I would teach guys how to approach women, get them laughing and enjoying the interaction. The getting phone numbers and inviting women on dates. I did this for about 12 years. I got quite good at hooking up with women. 3 different women in one day was my record.

Not sure why I'm sharing all this... anyway, one day I noticed how I felt so empty and had no real relationships. I decided to stop there and then. I took everything down (websites, ebooks, youtube channel). 

I have been on a path of figuring myself and this life out since. I've discovered a lot of really awesome and cool things... 

A few days ago while traveling by bus I met another passenger who was really beautiful and we got talking and I noticed a connection that I haven't really felt for a very long time. She was asking me a lot of questions and we just seemed to enjoy chatting with each other.

I very much liked this feeling and realised this is what I want. My whole approach to dating and women has changed from wanting to sleep with beautiful women to wanting to find love. 

So, after getting off the bus, we said our goodbyes (I didn't bother trying to get her number or anything)... The next morning I'm at a cafe having my second cup of coffee and she walks in. OMG! I couldn't believe it. I went to say hi and again we had such a connection. It was really nice.

She was leaving the following day and was only in the country for another week or so. I let it go. It didn't feel right to try to make something happen. My approach to life these days is more of allowing, surrender, and just letting life happen. 

So here I am a few days later and I've realised how nice it would be to have a relationship... I envy those who are in relationships and in love. Must be really really nice. 

I would love to hear anything from anyone that might help me bring about a love relationship. 

I've listened to teaching from Neville Goddard on believing a thing into being. The gist of it is to feel the feeling of having the thing that you would like to have. I guess that means imagining that I'm already in a relationship with someone I'min love with. 

I'm 40 and have never had this so it's a bit of a stretch. I've never seen myself as someone who could be in a relationship with someone. I've had sex with a lot of women (100+) but never with someone I loved. I reckon sleeping with someone you really like and love must be an extremely pleasant experience?

OK, so, I'm going to try convince myself that I'm already in a relationship with someone I love and who loves me... fingers crossed that this brings the desired outcome about.

Any suggestions?

Thanks ;) 

PS, this feels pretty good. I am 2 cups of coffee down and listening to some tasty down tempo music with some noise cancelling earbuds... in a nice cafe...

It's not about sex... it's about the experience of being with someone who makes me feel incredible. The other side of the coin is that all the feelings exist in me already... I'm very much into spiritual studies and non duality, meditation etc. Well... this has been interesting. I'm super independent. I love being on my own and traveling (currently in my 24th country)... 

Thank you for reading all this way... for taking it in and for any helpful suggestions x",6,1756517539.0,love,1,1.0,False
1n3p6ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n3p6ep/how_to_handle_that_one_person_who_questions/,How to Handle That One Person Who Questions Everything ü§î,"

*A Practical Guide for Home, Work, and Life*

---

We all know them. That family member who raises an eyebrow at every decision. The colleague who seems to doubt every proposal. The friend who always asks ""But what if...?"" These individuals appear in every corner of our lives, and learning to work with them effectively can make the difference between harmony and constant tension.

## Understanding the Psychology Behind Constant Questioning üß†

People who frequently express doubt or suspicion aren't necessarily trying to be difficult. Often, this behavior stems from:

**Past Experiences** - Someone who has been let down repeatedly may develop a protective shield of skepticism. Their questioning isn't personal; it's a survival mechanism.

**Different Processing Styles** - Some individuals are naturally analytical. They need to understand the ""why"" and ""how"" before they can feel comfortable moving forward.

**Fear of Consequences** - When stakes feel high, some people become extra cautious. What looks like suspicion might actually be anxiety about potential outcomes.

**Cultural Background** - In some families or cultures, questioning authority and decisions is considered wise and responsible behavior.

## The Power of Active Listening üëÇ

Before attempting to address suspicious behavior, invest time in truly hearing what the person is saying. Often, beneath the surface-level doubts lies genuine concern or valuable insight.

**Create Safe Spaces for Expression** - Let them voice their concerns without immediate pushback. Sometimes people just need to be heard before they can move forward.

**Ask Clarifying Questions** - Instead of getting defensive, try responses like ""Help me understand what specifically worries you about this"" or ""What would need to change for you to feel more comfortable?""

**Validate Their Perspective** - You don't have to agree with someone to acknowledge their viewpoint. Simple phrases like ""I can see why that would concern you"" can significantly reduce tension.

## Building Trust Through Transparency üîç

Suspicious individuals often relax when they have access to information. The more transparent you can be, the less room there is for doubt to grow.

**Share Your Decision-Making Process** - Instead of just presenting conclusions, walk them through how you arrived at your decision. Show your work, so to speak.

**Acknowledge Limitations** - Be honest about what you don't know or areas where things might go wrong. This honesty often builds more trust than false certainty.

**Provide Regular Updates** - Keep suspicious team members or family members informed about progress, setbacks, and changes. Surprises fuel suspicion.

## Practical Strategies for Different Settings üè†üíº

### At Home with Family Members

**The Suspicious Spouse** - Include them in planning processes. If they doubt financial decisions, show them the budget spreadsheet. If they question parenting choices, discuss the research together.

**The Questioning Parent** - Acknowledge their experience while maintaining your autonomy. Try ""I appreciate your concern about this decision. Here's what I've considered..."" rather than ""You always doubt everything I do.""

**The Skeptical Sibling** - Set boundaries around their questioning while remaining open to genuine concerns. ""I'm happy to discuss this once, but after that, I need you to trust my judgment.""

### In Professional Environments

**The Doubtful Boss** - Anticipate their concerns by preparing thorough explanations. Document your processes and results. Regular check-ins can prevent suspicion from building.

**The Skeptical Colleague** - Collaborate rather than compete. Ask for their input early in projects. When people feel involved in creating solutions, they're less likely to doubt them.

**The Questioning Team Member** - Channel their analytical nature into useful roles like quality control or risk assessment. Make their tendency to question an asset rather than an obstacle.

## Converting Suspicion into Collaboration ü§ù

The most effective long-term strategy involves transforming suspicious individuals from critics into allies.

**Assign Them Oversight Roles** - Put their natural skepticism to work by asking them to review plans, spot potential problems, or conduct research on alternatives.

**Create Feedback Systems** - Establish regular opportunities for them to raise concerns and provide input. This prevents issues from festering.

**Celebrate Their Contributions** - When their questioning leads to improvements or prevents problems, acknowledge it publicly. This reinforces the positive aspects of their behavior.

## Managing Your Own Reactions üòå

Dealing with constantly suspicious people can be exhausting. Protecting your own mental energy is crucial for long-term success.

**Don't Take It Personally** - Remember that their suspicion likely has nothing to do with you specifically. It's a pattern they've developed over time.

**Set Emotional Boundaries** - You can be empathetic without absorbing their anxiety or doubt. Their concerns are valid, but you don't need to make them your own.

**Know When to Step Back** - If someone's suspicion becomes toxic or paralyzing, it may be necessary to limit their involvement in certain decisions or processes.

## The Art of Gradual Trust Building üå±

Trust develops slowly, especially with naturally suspicious people. Think of it as tending a garden rather than flipping a switch.

**Start Small** - Begin with low-stakes situations where you can demonstrate reliability. Success in minor matters builds credibility for larger decisions.

**Be Consistent** - Suspicious people pay attention to patterns. If you say you'll do something, do it. If plans change, explain why immediately.

**Admit Mistakes Quickly** - When things go wrong, address it head-on rather than trying to minimize or hide problems. This builds long-term credibility.

## Communication Techniques That Work üí¨

**Use Specific Examples** - Instead of general assurances, provide concrete details. Rather than ""This will work fine,"" try ""Based on the three similar situations we've handled, here's what we can expect...""

**Acknowledge Risks Upfront** - Address potential problems before they raise them. This shows you've thought things through and aren't being naive.

**Provide Multiple Options** - Give them choices when possible. People are more likely to support decisions they helped make.

## When Suspicion Crosses the Line üö´

Sometimes, questioning behavior becomes destructive rather than protective. Recognize these warning signs:

**Paralyzing Decision-Making** - When suspicion prevents any forward progress, intervention is needed.

**Personal Attacks** - If questioning shifts from examining ideas to attacking character, boundaries must be established.

**Spreading Negativity** - When one person's suspicion begins contaminating team morale or family dynamics, the situation requires direct addressing.

In these cases, have a private conversation focused on impact rather than intent. Explain how their behavior affects others and what changes are needed.

## The Long-Term View üîÆ

Remember that suspicious individuals often become your most loyal supporters once trust is established. Their high standards mean that when they finally believe in something or someone, that belief runs deep.

Many of the world's most successful teams include natural skeptics who help prevent costly mistakes and ensure thorough preparation. The key is learning to work with their nature rather than against it.

## Creating Win-Win Outcomes üéØ

The goal isn't to eliminate suspicion entirely ‚Äì healthy skepticism can be valuable. Instead, aim to:

**Channel it productively** - Use their analytical nature to strengthen plans and identify weaknesses.

**Build mutual respect** - Show that you value their input while maintaining your decision-making authority.

**Develop understanding** - Help them see that not every situation requires maximum caution.

## Practical Daily Actions ‚≠ê

**Morning Meetings** - Start days with brief updates to prevent information gaps that fuel suspicion.

**Decision Documentation** - Keep simple records of why choices were made to reference later when questions arise.

**Regular Check-ins** - Schedule consistent times for suspicious individuals to voice concerns before they build up.

**Feedback Loops** - Create systems where their observations can improve processes, making their questioning valuable rather than disruptive.

## The Patience Factor ‚è∞

Working with suspicious individuals requires patience, but the investment often pays significant dividends. Once you earn their trust, they frequently become your strongest advocates and most reliable team members.

Remember that behind most suspicious behavior lies someone who cares deeply about outcomes and wants to avoid problems. Learning to work with this motivation rather than against it transforms challenging relationships into productive partnerships.

The techniques outlined here work because they address the root causes of suspicious behavior rather than just its symptoms. By providing transparency, building trust gradually, and channeling skepticism productively, you can turn your biggest questioner into your most valuable ally.

Whether dealing with a doubting family member, a skeptical boss, or a questioning teammate, these approaches help create environments where caution serves everyone rather than hindering progress. The result is stronger decisions, better outcomes, and more harmonious relationships all around.

*Transform your relationships and boost productivity with these time-tested strategies*

---

Procrastination touches every corner of human existence. Whether it's your teenager avoiding homework, your colleague missing deadlines, or even yourself putting off important tasks, the challenge remains universal. The good news? There are proven methods to address this behavior that work across all relationships and situations.

## Understanding the Root Causes üå±

Before diving into solutions, let's examine why people delay action. Procrastination rarely stems from laziness. Instead, it typically emerges from:

**Fear of Failure**: Many individuals postpone tasks because they worry about not meeting expectations. This fear creates a paralyzing loop where avoiding the task feels safer than attempting it.

**Overwhelm**: When tasks appear too large or complex, the natural response is avoidance. The human brain struggles to process massive undertakings, leading to decision paralysis.

**Perfectionism**: Ironically, those with the highest standards often delay the most. They wait for the ""perfect moment"" or ""perfect conditions"" that never arrive.

**Lack of Clear Direction**: Without specific goals or understanding of next steps, people naturally drift toward easier, more immediate activities.

**Energy Management Issues**: Sometimes procrastination signals deeper problems with rest, nutrition, or mental health that affect motivation and focus.

## The Universal Framework: CLEAR Method üîÑ

This approach works whether you're dealing with family members, team members, or addressing your own patterns. The beauty lies in its adaptability to any relationship dynamic.

### C - Connect Before Correcting ü§ù

Start every interaction with genuine connection. People resist change when they feel judged or criticized. Instead of immediately addressing the delayed task, invest time in understanding the person's perspective.

**With Family Members**: Ask open-ended questions about their day, challenges, or feelings before discussing the avoided responsibility. ""I noticed you seemed stressed lately. What's on your mind?""

**With Colleagues**: Begin meetings with brief personal check-ins. Understanding someone's current workload or personal pressures provides context for their delays.

**With Yourself**: Practice self-compassion. Examine your own patterns without harsh judgment. ""What circumstances led to this delay?""

### L - Listen to Understand Barriers üëÇ

Active listening reveals the true obstacles preventing action. Most people have legitimate reasons for their delays, even if they seem irrational on the surface.

**Effective Listening Techniques**:
- Reflect back what you hear without adding your own interpretation
- Ask clarifying questions to understand deeper concerns
- Validate feelings even if you disagree with the behavior
- Resist the urge to immediately offer solutions

**Common Hidden Barriers**:
- Skill gaps that haven't been acknowledged
- Resource constraints (time, tools, information)
- Competing priorities that seem more urgent
- Past negative experiences with similar tasks
- Physical or mental health challenges

### E - Establish Small, Concrete Steps üìã

Large tasks feel overwhelming. Breaking them into tiny, manageable pieces removes the intimidation factor and creates momentum.

**The 2-Minute Rule**: If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. For larger tasks, identify the smallest possible first step that takes under two minutes.

**Progressive Building**: Each completed small step builds confidence and momentum for the next slightly larger step.

**Specific Action Items**: Replace vague goals like ""work on the project"" with precise actions like ""open the document and write the first paragraph.""

### A - Agree on Accountability Systems ‚öñÔ∏è

Accountability works best when it feels supportive rather than punitive. The goal is creating external structure that makes follow-through easier.

**Family Accountability**:
- Regular check-in conversations at set times
- Shared calendars or tracking systems
- Celebration of small wins
- Natural consequences rather than punishments

**Workplace Accountability**:
- Weekly progress meetings with specific agenda items
- Peer partnerships where colleagues support each other's goals
- Public commitments to team goals
- Regular milestone reviews

**Personal Accountability**:
- Finding an accountability partner
- Using apps or tools that track progress
- Setting up environmental cues and reminders
- Creating reward systems for completed tasks

### R - Recognize and Reward Progress üéâ

Humans are motivated by progress recognition. Celebrating small wins maintains momentum and builds positive associations with task completion.

**Recognition Principles**:
- Acknowledge effort, not just results
- Be specific about what improved
- Offer recognition promptly after progress occurs
- Match the recognition to the person's preferences (some prefer private acknowledgment, others enjoy public praise)

## Adapting Your Approach by Relationship Type üé≠

### Family Dynamics üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

Family relationships carry emotional complexity that requires extra sensitivity. Blood relations often trigger deeper emotional responses, making patience and understanding crucial.

**With Children and Teenagers**:
- Focus on teaching life skills rather than just completing tasks
- Connect delays to their personal goals and interests
- Use natural consequences rather than punishments
- Model the behavior you want to see

**With Partners**:
- Avoid parental or supervisory language
- Focus on how delays affect shared goals
- Negotiate responsibilities based on individual strengths
- Maintain respect for different working styles

**With Extended Family**:
- Respect boundaries and adult autonomy
- Offer support without taking over
- Focus on your own responses to their delays
- Choose battles wisely

### Professional Settings üíº

Workplace relationships require balancing personal connection with professional objectives. The key is maintaining respect while ensuring productivity.

**With Direct Reports**:
- Provide clear expectations and deadlines
- Regular one-on-one meetings to discuss obstacles
- Professional development opportunities to address skill gaps
- Document patterns while focusing on solutions

**With Peers**:
- Collaborative problem-solving approaches
- Mutual accountability partnerships
- Open communication about how delays affect your work
- Focus on team goals rather than individual criticism

**With Supervisors**:
- Proactive communication about potential delays
- Suggesting solutions along with identifying problems
- Regular progress updates to build trust
- Seeking additional resources or guidance when needed

### Community and Social Groups üåü

Volunteer organizations, clubs, and social groups present unique challenges because relationships are voluntary and consequences are often less direct.

**Key Strategies**:
- Emphasize shared mission and values
- Create role clarity to prevent confusion
- Build in flexibility for life circumstances
- Focus on contribution rather than perfection

## Advanced Techniques for Persistent Patterns üß†

When basic approaches don't create change, deeper strategies may be necessary.

### Environmental Design üè†

Shape the environment to make positive action easier and delays more difficult.

**Physical Environment**:
- Remove distractions from work spaces
- Place visual reminders in strategic locations
- Organize tools and materials for easy access
- Create dedicated spaces for specific activities

**Digital Environment**:
- Use website blockers during focused work time
- Set up automated reminders and calendar alerts
- Organize digital files for easy retrieval
- Implement tools that track time and progress

### Energy and Timing Optimization ‚è∞

Work with natural energy rhythms rather than against them.

**Understanding Energy Patterns**:
- Identify peak performance times for different types of tasks
- Schedule challenging work during high-energy periods
- Plan easier tasks for lower-energy times
- Build in regular breaks and recovery periods

**Timing Strategies**:
- Use deadlines strategically (not too far out, not too close)
- Batch similar activities together
- Plan for seasonal or cyclical changes in motivation
- Allow buffer time for unexpected obstacles

### Cognitive Reframing üîÑ

Help shift thought patterns that contribute to delay behaviors.

**Common Unhelpful Thoughts and Reframes**:
- ""It has to be perfect"" ‚Üí ""Done is better than perfect""
- ""I don't have enough time"" ‚Üí ""I can make progress in the time I have""
- ""I don't know where to start"" ‚Üí ""I can take one small step forward""
- ""I'll do it tomorrow"" ‚Üí ""What can I do right now, even if it's tiny?""

## Building Long-term Change üå±

Sustainable change requires patience and consistency. Quick fixes rarely address underlying patterns that took years to develop.

### Habit Formation üîÑ

Transform sporadic efforts into automatic behaviors through systematic habit building.

**The Habit Loop**:
1. **Cue**: Environmental trigger that initiates the behavior
2. **Routine**: The behavior itself
3. **Reward**: The benefit gained from completing the behavior

**Habit Stacking**: Attach new desired behaviors to existing strong habits. ""After I drink my morning coffee, I will review my daily priorities.""

### Identity-Based Change üí™

Focus on becoming the type of person who naturally does these behaviors rather than just trying to complete specific tasks.

**Identity Questions**:
- ""What would a highly organized person do in this situation?""
- ""How would someone who respects others' time handle this deadline?""
- ""What would a person who values their own goals do right now?""

### Systems Thinking üîß

Create systems that support consistent action rather than relying on motivation alone.

**System Elements**:
- Regular review and planning sessions
- Streamlined processes for common tasks
- Backup plans for when motivation is low
- Support networks that encourage progress

## Measuring Progress and Adjusting Approaches üìä

Effective change requires ongoing assessment and refinement of strategies.

### Progress Indicators üìà

Look for both quantitative and qualitative signs of improvement:

**Quantitative Measures**:
- Task completion rates
- Time between task assignment and completion
- Number of missed deadlines
- Quality ratings of completed work

**Qualitative Measures**:
- Reduced stress levels around deadlines
- Improved communication about obstacles
- Increased initiative in starting tasks
- Better collaboration and relationship quality

### Adjustment Strategies üîß

When progress stalls, consider these modifications:

**Strategy Adjustments**:
- Reduce step sizes if current ones feel overwhelming
- Increase accountability frequency for additional support
- Change reward systems if current ones lose motivation
- Address new barriers that weren't initially apparent

**Relationship Adjustments**:
- Modify communication styles based on what resonates
- Adjust expectations based on realistic capabilities
- Change your own responses to create different dynamics
- Seek additional support or resources when needed

## Cultural and Individual Differences üåç

Effective approaches respect individual differences and cultural contexts.

### Cultural Considerations üó∫Ô∏è

Different cultures have varying relationships with time, authority, and individual versus collective goals.

**Time Orientation**:
- Some cultures prioritize relationships over strict schedules
- Others emphasize punctuality and efficiency
- Flexible approaches honor different time values
- Focus on outcomes rather than specific methods

**Communication Styles**:
- Direct feedback works well in some contexts
- Indirect, relationship-preserving approaches suit others
- Observe and adapt to individual preferences
- Maintain respect regardless of cultural differences

### Individual Personality Factors üß©

People have different working styles, motivation patterns, and stress responses.

**Introversion vs. Extraversion**:
- Introverts may prefer written communication and private feedback
- Extraverts often benefit from verbal discussion and group accountability
- Both types need different types of social support
- Energy management strategies vary significantly

**Detail-Oriented vs. Big-Picture Thinking**:
- Detail-oriented people may get stuck in perfectionism
- Big-picture thinkers might struggle with specific steps
- Provide support that matches natural thinking patterns
- Bridge different styles in team settings

## Creating Lasting Change in Different Settings üè¢

### Home Environment üè†

Family change requires patience and consistency because emotional bonds can trigger resistance to new expectations.

**Sustainable Family Changes**:
- Start with one person (often yourself) modeling new behaviors
- Have family discussions about shared goals and values
- Create systems that work for everyone's schedules and preferences
- Celebrate family wins together
- Allow for individual differences within shared expectations

### Workplace Environment üíº

Professional changes need to align with business objectives while respecting individual needs.

**Organizational Support**:
- Clear policies and procedures that support timely completion
- Training and development opportunities to address skill gaps
- Recognition systems that reward progress and effort
- Leadership modeling of desired behaviors
- Regular feedback and coaching conversations

### Community Groups ü§ù

Voluntary organizations require approaches that maintain engagement while encouraging follow-through.

**Community Strategies**:
- Connect tasks to shared mission and values
- Provide multiple ways to contribute based on different strengths
- Build in flexibility for life circumstances
- Create social connections that support accountability
- Focus on progress rather than perfection

## Preventing Future Procrastination Patterns üõ°Ô∏è

Once you've addressed current delays, focus on preventing future patterns from developing.

### Early Warning Systems üö®

Develop awareness of early signs that delays are beginning to occur.

**Personal Warning Signs**:
- Avoiding specific topics in conversations
- Feeling overwhelmed when thinking about certain tasks
- Making excuses or justifications for delays
- Physical symptoms like tension or fatigue around certain activities

**Interpersonal Warning Signs**:
- Communication becoming less frequent or less detailed
- Defensive responses to questions about progress
- Shifting blame to external circumstances
- Repeated promises without corresponding action

### Proactive Strategies üéØ

Build habits and systems that naturally prevent procrastination rather than just responding to it after it occurs.

**Prevention Techniques**:
- Regular planning and review sessions
- Breaking large projects into phases from the beginning
- Building buffer time into all major deadlines
- Creating backup plans for common obstacles
- Developing multiple accountability relationships

## Advanced Problem-Solving for Stubborn Cases üîç

Some procrastination patterns resist standard approaches and require more intensive strategies.

### Addressing Root Issues üåø

Sometimes delays signal deeper problems that need attention.

**Underlying Issues**:
- Anxiety or depression affecting motivation and energy
- Skills gaps that create legitimate obstacles
- Conflict avoidance in relationships or work settings
- Life transitions that disrupt normal patterns
- Physical health problems affecting cognitive function

**Getting Additional Support**:
- Professional counseling for mental health concerns
- Training or education to address skill gaps
- Mediation for relationship conflicts
- Medical evaluation for health-related obstacles
- Career coaching for work-related challenges

### Boundary Setting üöß

Sometimes the most helpful approach is changing your own relationship to someone else's procrastination rather than trying to change their behavior.

**Healthy Boundaries**:
- Taking care of your own responsibilities regardless of others' delays
- Communicating natural consequences without attempting to control outcomes
- Offering support within limits that don't create resentment
- Focusing on your own responses and choices
- Seeking support for your own stress about others' behaviors

## Daily Implementation Guide üìÖ

## Building Your Personal Action Plan üéØ

Create a customized approach based on your specific situation and relationships.

### Assessment Questions ü§î

Before implementing strategies, understand your unique context.

**Situation Assessment**:
- Who in your life struggles with procrastination, and how does it affect you?
- What patterns do you notice in timing, types of tasks, or circumstances?
- What approaches have you tried before, and what were the results?
- What resources (time, energy, support) do you have available?
- What are your most important goals for addressing these delays?

### Strategy Selection üé®

Choose techniques that match your personality, relationships, and circumstances.

**Selection Criteria**:
- Start with approaches that feel most natural and sustainable
- Consider the preferences and personalities of people involved
- Match strategies to the severity and persistence of delay patterns
- Begin with one or two techniques rather than trying everything at once

## Maintaining Your Own Motivation üí™

Supporting others through behavior change can be emotionally demanding. Take care of yourself throughout the process.

### Self-Care Strategies üßò

Maintain your own well-being while supporting others.

**Energy Management**:
- Set boundaries around how much time and energy you invest in others' changes
- Take breaks from coaching or supporting roles
- Engage in activities that restore your motivation and optimism
- Seek support for your own frustrations and challenges

**Perspective Maintenance**:
- Remember that you can't control others' choices, only your own responses

## Conclusion: The Ripple Effect of Change üåä

When you successfully help someone overcome procrastination patterns, the benefits extend far beyond just getting tasks completed. You contribute to:

**Personal Growth**: The person develops confidence, self-efficacy, and better life management skills that serve them in many areas.

The investment you make in addressing procrastination pays dividends in stronger relationships, increased productivity, reduced stress, and greater life satisfaction for everyone involved. Take the first step today, no matter how small, and begin building the positive patterns that will serve you and your loved ones for years to come.

*Remember: Change is possible at any age, in any relationship, and in any circumstance. The key is starting where you are, using what you have, and doing what you can. Your patience, understanding, and consistent support can help transform not just individual behaviors, but entire relationship dynamics and life trajectories.*

1n3p08n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1n3p08n/am_i_overreacting/,Am I Overreacting,"Hi everybody! I don't expect anyone to be reading this - I guess i'm just gonna be using this as somewhat as a vent post but advice would be kind of appreciated. So I (F 18) am in a relationship with Mark (Fake name for privacy) (M 18) for 1 year and a bit and we've been doing quite well except for 1 thing. Theres this other girl, Bianca (F 19) (fake name for privacy) and I am extremely uncomfortable with their relationship - however what they do is not like obviously cheating or anything like that. This all started off when Mark made a joke talking about Bianca being the '2.0' version of me (Bianca and I both have the same name) and I was deeply hurt because I thought he meant she was better than me and in all honesty she very much is: she's got these beautiful brown curls that look better than mine, pretty face, my dream body. He apologised so much after but the damage was done and its shifted our relationship while also making me feel really, really insecure. For context though, Bianca and Mark have been friends longer than I have been in a relationship with Mark - They go to a school on Saturday for languages so I understand why they need to interact/talk (I've made it clear that school related stuff is obviously okay!) 

However there are a few things I find a bit. weird? So he's obviously on her close friends story but a lot of what she posts on her close friends story are bikini pics/body pics which I find weird - However Mark obviously can't control and I do trust that he won't look at them. They've also had to do dances for their school harmony days that involves them holding hands and spinning her around - I do understand that it was for school and yes there were factors as to why they had to be partners, however I just wish of all girls that it didn't have to be her. I've also told him that I don't really want them talking - This is definitely from my insecurities but I simply just don't trust her after everything despite never meeting this girl. However its been a repetitive few months of them having conversations that don't revolve around school, me repeating boundaries, Mark still having those conversations, me repeating boundaries and so on. I've on many occasions cried my heart out about her, being prettier, better than me - we've had arguments and its clearly caused tension between us but because of school he still remains friends with her, but it's not like she's his only friend there - He has a bunch of guy friends as well but I guess he's just much closer to her. He's used the excuse that she's told him a lot of personal stuff about family/home life, he's known her longer than he has me which yes I understand! But sometimes my boundaries don't always get respected? Its a very complicated situation (For context I see their chat history because I do have access to Mark's social media and he has access to mine). I feel personally that although their behaviour is okay, the principle of a lot of situations regarding my boundaries is not always respected and just simply gets forgotten which leads to my frustration, fights, crying etc. 

Now, today, like right now - I'm in bed just writing about this and the both of them have met up to go and visit an open day for a College - My main reason of concern is the simple fact that they chose to meet up (because they needed to go with someone else so both could get parent permission). So Mark told me that if she came late he would just leave, but he met with a guy friend earlier to talk about him working at a different place, had some food and by the time he had finished Bianca had arrived. I personally think he was waiting for her to come so they could go together but its just a gut feeling type of thing? Not like evidence. She also messaged him asking if he wanted to grab coffee, which I obviously hoped he was going to say ""no thanks"" since he's not a coffee drinker. But he was more so indirect? ""Icl ion drink coffee"" ""I'll try make it"". When i questioned him about it he said that all his friends new that was some ""code"" for no but in my opinion i just really don't get why he didn't just say no? I feel like I'm going crazy trying to dissect this like he's some bad boyfriend, he's not, I love him so much, he's the light of my life. Also for more context, she has no idea that she's done this at all, like she personally has not contributed to this tension at all, its just the relationship of Bianca and Mark that's caused this. 

Okay as i'm writing this apparently the trains are down so both him and Bianca are in an uber together but anywhoodle 

So anyways, I don't expect anyone to read this, I'm not asking some validation for the way i feel. I just want to stop feeling so insecure when I stalk her instagram, when I see their chats, I want to stop imagining the way they could have looked at each-other when they danced together, I hate thinking about the times he's complimented her. So I want some real, honest advice here if possible? Thank you so much for reading, if you've made it this far to my little drama story (theres a lot more to this story than mentioned but for privacy I'll try not to say more than mentioned) üíï",2,1756517014.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Life isn't always sunshine and rainbows. We've all found ourselves in situations where negativity seems to dominate ‚Äì whether it's a workplace filled with backstabbing colleagues, a family gathering where drama unfolds, or social circles where gossip and criticism run rampant. These challenging environments can drain our energy, dampen our spirits, and make us question our own worth.

But here's the thing: you don't have to let toxic surroundings define your experience or limit your potential. With the right mindset and practical strategies, you can not only survive but actually flourish in the most difficult circumstances.

## Understanding the Challenge üéØ

Toxic environments share common characteristics that make them particularly draining. They're often marked by constant negativity, lack of support, excessive criticism, manipulation, and an atmosphere where people tear each other down rather than build each other up. These spaces can exist anywhere ‚Äì in offices, schools, communities, or even within our own homes.

The key insight is this: while you can't always control your environment, you absolutely can control your response to it. This fundamental shift in perspective forms the foundation of everything that follows.

## Building Your Mental Fortress üè∞

Think of your mind as a fortress that needs strong walls to protect what matters most ‚Äì your peace, confidence, and sense of purpose. Here's how to construct those walls:

**Develop Selective Hearing**
Not every comment, criticism, or negative remark deserves your attention. Learn to filter out the noise that doesn't serve your growth. When someone makes a snide remark, ask yourself: ""Is this feedback valuable, or is this just someone else's frustration being projected onto me?"" Most of the time, it's the latter.

**Create Mental Boundaries**
Imagine an invisible shield around yourself. Other people's moods, dramas, and problems don't have to become yours. You can be empathetic without absorbing every emotion around you. Practice saying to yourself, ""That's their issue, not mine"" when confronted with unnecessary drama.

**Focus on Your Circle of Influence**
There are things you can control and things you can't. Toxic people's behavior falls into the ""can't control"" category. Your reactions, choices, and personal development fall into the ""can control"" category. Pour your energy into what you can actually influence.

## Practical Daily Strategies üí™

**Morning Armor Ritual**
Start each day by mentally preparing yourself. Spend five minutes thinking about your goals, reminding yourself of your worth, and setting an intention to remain positive regardless of what others throw your way. This isn't about toxic positivity ‚Äì it's about entering challenging spaces with purpose and clarity.

**The 24-Hour Rule**
When someone says or does something that bothers you, give yourself 24 hours before reacting. Most of the time, you'll realize the situation isn't worth your emotional investment. This prevents you from getting pulled into unnecessary conflicts.

**Document Everything Important**
In professional toxic environments, keep records of important conversations, decisions, and achievements. This protects you from gaslighting and provides clarity when situations become unclear. Always cover your bases professionally.

**Find Your Allies**
Even in the most challenging environments, there are usually one or two people who share your values. Identify these individuals and build genuine connections with them. Having even one supportive person can make a tremendous difference.

**Master the Art of Gray Rock**
When dealing with particularly difficult people, become as uninteresting as possible. Give short, factual responses. Don't share personal information. Don't react emotionally to provocations. Like a gray rock, you become too boring to mess with.

## Emotional Regulation Techniques üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**The 5-4-3-2-1 Technique**
When you feel overwhelmed by negativity, ground yourself by identifying: 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This brings you back to the present moment and out of emotional reactivity.

**Reframe the Narrative**
Instead of thinking ""Why is this happening to me?"" try ""What can I learn from this situation?"" or ""How is this making me stronger?"" This shift transforms you from a victim into someone actively growing through challenges.

**Energy Management**
Treat your emotional energy like a finite resource. Don't waste it on people and situations that don't deserve it. Save your best energy for relationships and activities that actually matter to your long-term happiness and success.

## Building Resilience Through Action üöÄ

**Invest in Yourself Daily**
Read books, learn new skills, exercise, or pursue hobbies that bring you joy. When you're constantly improving yourself, external negativity has less power over you. You become too busy becoming awesome to worry about what others think.

**Create Safe Spaces**
Identify or create environments where you can be authentically yourself. This might be a weekly coffee date with a trusted friend, a hobby group, or even just a comfortable corner in your home where you can relax and recharge.

**Set Clear Consequences**
Don't just set boundaries ‚Äì enforce them. If someone consistently disrespects you, limit your interactions with them. If a particular environment is too toxic, start making plans to change your situation when possible.

**Practice Strategic Communication**
Learn to communicate in ways that minimize conflict while protecting your interests. Use phrases like ""I understand your perspective"" (without agreeing), ""Let me think about that"" (buying time), or ""That's interesting"" (neutral response to provocative statements).

## Long-Term Success Strategies üìà

**Play the Long Game**
Don't get caught up in daily dramas. Keep your eyes on your bigger goals. While others are focused on office politics or personal feuds, you're building skills, networks, and opportunities for your future.

**Become Valuable**
The best protection against toxic behavior is being so good at what you do that you become indispensable. Invest in developing skills that make you valuable in any environment.

**Plan Your Exit Strategy**
Even as you work to thrive in your current situation, always have a plan for improving your circumstances. This might mean saving money to change jobs, developing skills for a career transition, or building relationships that could lead to better opportunities.

**Help Others Quietly**
When possible, be the positive force that others need. Small acts of kindness and support can create ripple effects that gradually improve even the most challenging environments.

## Maintaining Your Authenticity üåà

One of the biggest risks in toxic environments is losing yourself in the process of adapting. Here's how to stay true to who you are:

**Define Your Non-Negotiables**
Identify the core values and principles you won't compromise on, regardless of pressure. These might include honesty, treating others with respect, or maintaining your professional standards.

**Regular Self-Check-ins**
Periodically ask yourself: ""Am I still the person I want to be? Are my actions aligned with my values?"" If the answer is no, make adjustments before you drift too far from your authentic self.

**Celebrate Small Wins**
Acknowledge your daily victories, no matter how small. Successfully navigating a difficult conversation, helping a colleague, or simply maintaining your composure in a challenging situation all deserve recognition.

## The Ripple Effect üåä

As you implement these strategies, something interesting happens. Your newfound stability and confidence start influencing others around you. Some toxic people will lose interest in trying to affect you. Others might actually start treating you with more respect. And those who are also struggling in the same environment might find inspiration in your example.

You don't have to announce what you're doing or try to change everyone around you. Simply being a consistent example of someone who refuses to let negativity define their experience creates positive change naturally.

## Moving Forward with Confidence üí´

Remember, thriving in challenging environments isn't about becoming heartless or disconnected from others. It's about developing the emotional intelligence and practical skills needed to maintain your well-being and pursue your goals regardless of external circumstances.

Every difficult situation you navigate successfully builds your confidence and resilience for future challenges. You're not just surviving ‚Äì you're developing character traits and abilities that will serve you throughout your entire life.

The world needs people who can remain positive, productive, and kind even when surrounded by negativity. By mastering these skills, you're not only improving your own life but potentially inspiring others to do the same.

Your environment doesn't have to determine your destiny. With the right strategies, mindset, and commitment to your own growth, you can create success and happiness no matter where you find yourself.

Start implementing one or two of these strategies today. Your future self will thank you for taking control of your response to challenging circumstances and choosing to thrive rather than merely survive.

I‚Äôm trying to get us on a clear budget for the first time.

Together, we should\* bring home about $4,200/month (rounding down for taxes). Here‚Äôs the plan I want to propose:

* Bills/needs: $2,300
* Extra debt payments: $400
* Savings: $500
* Food/Gas: $400
* Left over: $600 - split as $300 each for personal spending money (coffee, games, etc.)

This way, all bills are covered, we‚Äôre paying down debt, saving each month, and still have a little fun money each.

I think this is fairly safe and balanced, but I‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúreal‚Äù budget before. Am I heading a good direction? I am also worried he won't listen... any tips for pitching the idea?

Liquid Lust (2025)

OMG it smells so good, of course given the name. Your skin but better - smells a little golden - reminds me a bit of Like the Very Gods by BPAL but I prefer this. 

Trying it again a few days later - oh yea, that‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs like that golden amber type of skin scent but a little elevated - does this have fig in it? Yep it does! I didn‚Äôt get the fig last time but it‚Äôs rested more now. Same fig as in Blanket Fort. I think I‚Äôm getting the cashmere too - it adds the textured clean note to it. This is the type of scent Nui Cobalt does so well - like goddess vibes. Like taking a bath with some type of fig bath oil and candlelight flickering. Very smooth and warm.

I was pretty sure I would get a full size but now that I‚Äôve noticed the fig, I‚Äôm a little unsure because I don‚Äôt like too much overlap in my collection and I already have Blanket Fort. 

Trying this another time - yea the fig is very in the forefront now - so this is a beautiful fig scent - kind of like a warmer Philosykos by Diptyque. I‚Äôm sensing wood as well. Anyways this is beautiful and like I said if I didn‚Äôt worry about redundancy in my collection, I‚Äôd def FS. 

Mirror:

I‚Äôm getting lemony white floral. Reminding me a little of Uncrossing and Giulia. Okay yes it‚Äôs the white tea. This is very pretty- I think it‚Äôs a similar white tea note as in House of Foundations. I‚Äôm not getting other notes per se but it‚Äôs like softened white tea with a hint of lemon. I thought maybe it had magnolia in it. 

Trying it again and still getting the same impression - lemony white tea. Very calming and clear. I think I‚Äôd consider a full size if I didn‚Äôt already have Uncrossing and Giulia. 


Starlight and Spider Silk (2021)

This is very Possets-coded. It reminds me a lot of both The Moon and the Silvers. For those unfamiliar, creamy white musk and vanilla type note‚Ä¶ But back to Starlight - this is really nice. I‚Äôve never tried the spider silks and now I see why it‚Äôs a recurring theme! It‚Äôs like sweetened white musk but still airy. Almost atmospheric. Like cool air. It‚Äôs like sitting at an open window on a cool, chilly night and there‚Äôs an unlit vanilla candle on the windowsill. Now I‚Äôm gonna have to try every spider silk because I love this type of scent!  The question is- do I need a full bottle given I have The Moon by Possets. They‚Äôre not exactly the same. 

I‚Äôve come back to this one over and over since trying all my samples - I want to try some variants before full sizing but I do think I‚Äôll probably end up getting one. 

Black sand beach:

Yummy! Smells maybe like golden amber with a hint of something salty or herbal. Another one reminding me of Like the Very Gods by BPAL. Or Akhal-teke by Nui Cobalt without the nuttiness. 

Coming back to it after more rest- this one has ended up being intriguing to me. It still is that golden amber but now it‚Äôs also mineralic? So it does evoke sand. It‚Äôs like a syrupy sand scent. I love summer scents that have a darker vibe, like beach goth, and I feel like this fits - like a moody dusk in Hawaii. This will be a possible full size for me. This is a good summer to autumn transition scent because of the syrupy depth. 

This seems like an obvious FS for me, but since it‚Äôs almost September I think I‚Äôll survive on my sample until next summer. 

Cord cutting:

Strong intriguing herbal smell! I can‚Äôt remember the notes for this - I‚Äôm getting a medicinal and grounding vibe. Something almost like peppermint in there - it‚Äôs a little zingy. I can see why that fits the name- it‚Äôs like a mental reset. Looking at the notes - it‚Äôs the clove that I‚Äôm really getting, duh. Yes all the notes make sense now but I couldn‚Äôt pick them out for some reason. I‚Äôm almost getting carnation I think from the jasmine and clove together. It‚Äôs a powerful scent. Very well blended. Drying down I am getting an austere, vintage floral. Reminding me a little of Family Plot by Strange South. I do surprisingly get the lily - I love Nui Cobalt‚Äôs funeral lily note so I recognize it - usually if Lily is combined with anything else it fades to the background. Overall I‚Äôd call this a spicy jasmine scent giving Old World. 

Divine Feminine:

Smells so familiar - I can‚Äôt pinpoint it but I‚Äôm almost getting lemon bar. No it‚Äôs lemon drop candy! I don‚Äôt know why because that doesn‚Äôt match the notes. Maybe it needs to rest. 

Came back a few days later and yep I‚Äôm still getting lemon drop candy or maybe like an orange hard candy? It‚Äôs so familiar but I can‚Äôt exactly pinpoint it. But yea it‚Äôs a little sweet, bright and fruity. Lemon and honey? Idk. I really don‚Äôt know what notes are accounting for that but I have smelt vanilla scents from Possets that are almost fruity. Am I getting grapefruit? Idk lol. 

Black Sheep:

Lighter scent color wise which for me usually means it needs to rest longer - I feel like base notes do fine traveling but top notes can go sour. So far this is leaning masculine. 

Hm so I‚Äôve been trying to let this one rest before reviewing and maybe it needs more rest. I‚Äôm getting a high pitched men‚Äôs cologne, it‚Äôs reminding me a little of Chess Club? Or a perfume that could be called like Gin & Tonic. I really want to find a good lambs wool scent, if anyone has one they recommend let me know! And let me know what you thought of this one - I can‚Äôt tell if it needs more than a week. Right now it‚Äôs like clean cologne which doesn‚Äôt fit the description. 

Funnily enough though as I‚Äôm sitting here with multiple samples on, I keep getting this clean airy scent that I like, and it‚Äôs Black Sheep. Ok why did I just find myself absentmindedly huffing my arm? Lol. I think in the drydown I am getting the wool - I just maybe don‚Äôt like the initial notes as much? Now it‚Äôs like how skin smells after showering with white soap + lambswool. 


Astral Plane:

Love this - it‚Äôs a little spa like, I‚Äôm sensing a white floral. Very peaceful, I might full size. 

Trying it another time, one of those ‚Äúgod that smells good‚Äù kind of scents. I ran across a review for it mentioning the lilac - now I recognize it. But white lilac must smell different than purple - just a little - because this does evoke white, pale green, pale blue.  I was on the hunt for a lilac scent and am surprised that this may be the one! Some lilacs are powdery. For me this is more delicate and watery somehow. 

Lilac Rabbit:

This was a freebie. I usually don‚Äôt try any of the rabbits because Little Brown Rabbit was way too sweet for me. I had to go peek at the notes because I had no clue what they could be other than lilac. I‚Äôm definitely getting the nutmeg, toasted marshmallow, and allspice and tonka. For me those are notes I‚Äôd usually steer away from - I‚Äôm not super into gourmand. But smelling it objectively - this is a cuddly, cozy sweet scent with a hint of floral. Okay as it‚Äôs drying down‚Ä¶ I may have been won over lol. I‚Äôm getting the carrot seed note now + something that to me smells like lily - it‚Äôs honestly smelling like floral carrot cake. And I‚Äôve never sought out a carrot cake scent but now I may want this!!

This one I came back to a few times - it‚Äôs very rich and unique. Almost intimidating? It‚Äôs so layered. 

Sallos:

Some type of white floral, maybe magnolia or gardenia, with the green stem, maybe tea rose? I don‚Äôt think it has rose but just describing what I‚Äôm getting. Ok I looked at the notes, and lol, yes there‚Äôs rose! This smells clean which also makes sense with the linden blossom. The lavender note - when I sniffed this in the vial it reminded me of Beekeeper‚Äôs Funeral which has lavender I believe. I‚Äôm going to have to feel this out because the rose stands out most to me, when I picked it for the gardenia. But if you‚Äôre looking for a dreamy, pretty floral scent, you‚Äôd like it! Same type of vibe as Beauty and Love.

Synchronicity:

I‚Äôm getting candy from this. Very girly. Like an artificial fruit flavor. The notes do make sense, peach, champagne, etc - I guess I was imagining a more grown up scent. The drydown is prettier, like this teenage girl is now in college and falling in love. Blush musk describes it well. I would‚Äôve guessed this had maybe a tiny bit of coffee or cocoa in it under the pink sweetness. 


And I‚Äôm ngl I also had Canoodling in a Cove but I can‚Äôt pinpoint it! So no review for now. I fear the Canoodlings aren‚Äôt for me! What‚Äôs their base?",12,1756516931.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Something clicked deeper than it‚Äôs ever clicked. 

Two things I learned from the first time I lost all that weight was my simple morning coffee. I‚Äôd put milk and sugar in it Willy nilly. I then learned to measure out what amount of milk I could ‚Äútolerate‚Äù in my coffee. As in exactly how much did I need to not hate the black coffee flavor. I then poured that into my coffee mug and saw where it ended on my cup (a little paw print, it‚Äôs a cat mug). From then on I knew exactly the portion size I needed without measuring all the time. Same with the sugar. I use Splenda now and I don‚Äôt even like sugary drinks, they‚Äôre way too sweet. 

I also learned that I like soda, and diet is totally ok. 

That comment just made me realize that small things like that are where I need to start.

1n3ox8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n3ox8v/the_art_of_guiding_strongwilled_children_a/,The Art of Guiding Strong-Willed Children: A Timeless Approach üåü,"

Every parent, educator, or caregiver has encountered them - those determined little humans who seem to have an answer for everything and a resistance to most suggestions. These children often get labeled as ""difficult,"" but what if we shifted our perspective entirely? What if these traits, when properly channeled, are actually signs of future leaders, innovators, and changemakers? 

## Understanding the Strong-Willed Child üß†

Before diving into practical strategies, let's understand what we're really dealing with. Strong-willed children aren't broken or defective - they're wired differently. Their brains are naturally inclined toward independence, critical thinking, and questioning authority. While this can be exhausting for adults, these same traits often translate into resilience, creativity, and leadership skills in adulthood.

Think of it this way: would you rather raise a child who blindly follows orders without question, or one who thinks critically and stands up for their beliefs? The challenge isn't to break their spirit - it's to guide it constructively.

## The Foundation: Respect and Understanding ü§ù

The most effective approach begins with a fundamental shift in how we view these interactions. Instead of seeing defiance, try to see independence. Instead of viewing questions as disrespect, recognize them as signs of an active, engaged mind.

### Start with Connection Before Correction

Before addressing any behavior, establish a genuine connection. This means:

- Getting down to their eye level during conversations
- Using a calm, steady tone even when frustrated
- Acknowledging their feelings before addressing their actions
- Showing genuine interest in their perspective

For example, instead of saying ""You need to clean your room right now,"" try ""I noticed your room is pretty messy. What's your plan for organizing it?""

## Practical Daily Strategies That Work üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. The Power of Choice Architecture

Strong-willed children thrive when they feel they have agency. Instead of giving direct commands, offer structured choices:

**Instead of:** ""Put on your coat.""
**Try:** ""Would you like to put your coat on before or after you put on your shoes?""

**Instead of:** ""Time for homework.""
**Try:** ""Would you prefer to do math or reading first?""

This approach gives them control within boundaries you've set, reducing power struggles while still achieving your goals.

### 2. The Problem-Solving Partnership

Transform conflicts into collaborative problem-solving sessions. When issues arise, ask questions like:

- ""What do you think would happen if...?""
- ""How could we solve this together?""
- ""What ideas do you have?""

This approach respects their intelligence while guiding them toward better decisions. It also teaches critical thinking skills that will serve them throughout life.

### 3. The Natural Consequences Method

Instead of imposing arbitrary punishments, let natural consequences do the teaching. If they refuse to wear a jacket, they'll get cold. If they don't do homework, they'll face the teacher's response. Your role becomes supportive rather than punitive.

When natural consequences occur, resist the urge to say ""I told you so."" Instead, offer empathy: ""That must have been uncomfortable being cold at recess. What might work better tomorrow?""

## Building Long-Term Success üìà

### Establish Clear, Consistent Boundaries

Strong-willed children actually crave structure, even if they push against it. The key is making boundaries:

- **Clear:** Everyone understands what's expected
- **Consistent:** Rules apply the same way every time
- **Reasonable:** Expectations match their developmental stage
- **Collaborative:** They understand the reasoning behind rules

### Catch Them Being Great

These children often receive more negative attention than positive. Make a conscious effort to notice and acknowledge their positive choices:

- ""I noticed how you helped your sister with her project without being asked.""
- ""You showed real persistence working on that puzzle.""
- ""Thank you for being honest about what happened.""

### Channel Their Energy Positively

Strong-willed children often have abundant energy and strong opinions. Help them find constructive outlets:

- Leadership roles in family or classroom activities
- Creative projects where they can make decisions
- Physical activities that challenge them
- Opportunities to help others or advocate for causes they care about

## Communication Strategies That Transform Relationships üí¨

### Listen First, Respond Second

When they come to you with complaints, arguments, or strong emotions, your first job is to understand, not to correct. Use phrases like:

- ""Help me understand your thinking here.""
- ""That sounds frustrating.""
- ""What would make this situation better for you?""

### Avoid Power Struggles

Recognize that arguments require two participants. When you feel yourself getting pulled into a battle of wills, try these responses:

- ""I need some time to think about this. Let's talk in ten minutes.""
- ""I can see you have strong feelings about this. Tell me more.""
- ""We both want the same thing - for you to be successful. How can we make that happen?""

### Use ""When/Then"" Statements

Instead of ultimatums, use logical sequences:

- ""When your homework is finished, then you can have screen time.""
- ""When you've put your dishes in the dishwasher, then we can start our movie.""

This removes you from the role of enforcer and makes the situation about natural order rather than your authority.

## Age-Appropriate Adaptations üéØ

### Young Children (Ages 3-7)

- Keep explanations simple and concrete
- Use visual aids and routines
- Offer limited choices (2-3 options maximum)
- Focus on immediate consequences rather than future ones

### School-Age Children (Ages 8-12)

- Involve them in creating family rules and consequences
- Use logical reasoning to explain decisions
- Encourage them to research and present their own solutions
- Allow them to experience the natural results of their choices

### Teenagers (Ages 13+)

- Treat them as junior partners in problem-solving
- Respect their growing need for independence
- Focus on building trust rather than maintaining control
- Help them connect their choices to their own goals and values

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ùå

### Don't Take It Personally

Their resistance isn't about you - it's about their developmental need for autonomy. Staying emotionally neutral helps you respond more effectively.

### Don't Try to Win Every Battle

Pick your battles wisely. Ask yourself: ""Will this matter in five years?"" Focus your energy on issues of safety, respect, and family values.

### Don't Use Shame or Humiliation

These tactics might work in the short term but damage the relationship long-term. Strong-willed children are often sensitive beneath their tough exterior.

### Don't Give Up Consistency

It's tempting to let things slide when you're tired, but inconsistency actually increases difficult behavior as children test boundaries more frequently.

## The Long-Term Vision üöÄ

Remember that you're not just managing today's behavior - you're shaping tomorrow's adult. The child who questions your authority today might become the adult who stands up for important principles. The one who argues with your decisions might become someone who thinks critically about complex problems.

Many successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and innovators were strong-willed children. Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey, and Richard Branson all showed early signs of independent thinking and resistance to conventional approaches.

## Creating Supportive Environments üè°

### At Home

- Establish regular family meetings where everyone can share concerns
- Create spaces where they can make their own decisions (their bedroom, personal projects)
- Develop family traditions that give them important roles
- Model the problem-solving and communication skills you want to see

### Working with Schools

- Communicate openly with teachers about strategies that work
- Advocate for learning environments that challenge and engage your child
- Look for opportunities for leadership within school settings
- Help teachers understand your child's communication style and motivations

## Self-Care for Adults üßò

Parenting or teaching strong-willed children is demanding. Make sure you're taking care of yourself:

- Find other adults who understand and can offer support
- Take regular breaks when possible
- Celebrate small victories
- Remember that difficult phases are temporary
- Seek professional guidance when needed

## Measuring Success Differently üìä

Traditional metrics of ""good behavior"" might not apply to strong-willed children. Instead, look for:

- Growing ability to express needs and concerns respectfully
- Increasing willingness to consider other perspectives
- Development of problem-solving skills
- Evidence of empathy and care for others
- Progress in self-regulation, even if it's gradual

## The Science Behind the Approach üî¨

Research in child development consistently shows that authoritative parenting (high expectations with high support) produces the best outcomes for all children, but especially for strong-willed ones. This approach:

- Builds secure attachment while respecting autonomy
- Develops intrinsic motivation rather than external compliance
- Teaches self-regulation skills
- Maintains positive relationships during challenging developmental phases

## Practical Tools for Daily Use üîß

### The Reset Button

When interactions go wrong, use this simple process:
1. Take a break if emotions are high
2. Acknowledge what happened without blame
3. Focus on moving forward positively
4. Make a plan together for similar situations

### The Reflection Questions

Help them develop self-awareness with questions like:
- ""How do you think that went?""
- ""What would you do differently next time?""
- ""How do you think the other person felt?""
- ""What did you learn from this situation?""

### The Collaborative Calendar

Let them have input in family scheduling and planning. This teaches time management while respecting their need for predictability and control.

## Building Resilience for the Future üí™

Strong-willed children often face unique challenges as they grow. Help them develop:

- **Emotional intelligence:** Understanding and managing their intense feelings
- **Social skills:** Learning to express their views while respecting others
- **Adaptability:** Finding ways to work within systems while maintaining their authenticity
- **Self-advocacy:** Knowing when and how to stand up for themselves appropriately

## When to Seek Additional Support ü§≤

While strong-willed behavior is normal, consider professional guidance if:

- Behaviors are significantly impacting school or family functioning
- There are signs of anxiety, depression, or other emotional concerns
- Traditional strategies aren't showing any progress after consistent application
- You're feeling overwhelmed and need additional tools

## The Bigger Picture üåç

These children often become adults who:
- Question injustice and work for positive change
- Think creatively about complex problems
- Show resilience in facing challenges
- Demonstrate strong leadership capabilities
- Stand up for their values and beliefs

Your role isn't to eliminate these traits but to help them develop alongside empathy, respect, and social awareness.

## Final Thoughts: Embracing the Journey üåà

Raising or working with strong-willed children isn't about finding a magic formula that makes them compliant. It's about building relationships, teaching skills, and guiding their natural strengths in positive directions.

Some days will be harder than others. Some strategies will work better for your specific child than others. The key is staying consistent with your core approach while remaining flexible in your methods.

Remember that these children often become the adults who make significant positive impacts on the world. Your patience, understanding, and guidance during their challenging years are investments in not just their future, but in the future of everyone whose lives they'll touch.

The strong-willed child sitting across from you today might someday thank you for not trying to break their spirit, but instead for helping them learn to use their strength wisely. That's a legacy worth the daily effort it takes to get there.

Every interaction is an opportunity to build connection, teach important life skills, and model the kind of person you hope they'll become. Trust the process, celebrate the small victories, and remember that the very traits that challenge you today are often the same ones that will make them remarkable adults tomorrow.

I remember back in university I got my best grades the semester that I was fully off caffeine. And it came easy and naturally just from getting good sleep and having the chemistry of my brain in balance.

But there's always been that ""one coffee"" to lure me back. I could never quite fully let it go. Not long ago I was doing okay by having the occasional coffee and mostly drinking chai in Australia where you can find some amazing sticky chai. It became my favourite hot beverage and coffee substitute over the past few years. Yes it has caffeine but my first priority is to just kick the coffee habit which is what does the real damage in my case.

I do agree though that full decaf gives the cleanest energy. And perhaps if I would just fully commit to that then I would not find myself caving so often. Since there is still caffeine in my system.

Anyway, to my point of this post. Since leaving Australia and solo traveling I couldn't have my chai and fell back in with coffee as a consistent daily habit. It's been a few months and I'm tired of being so desensitized to life. I barely recognize myself and behave less like the person I want to be on coffee, because it just makes me care less. It numbs. It has completely ruined my sleeping pattern and I've lost weight.

So it's time to quit (again). I'm at a point in my life where I need to make some changes. I need to build a foundation for the things I'm working to achieve in my life at this time and controlling my caffeine addiction has always been a key aspect of this from my experience. As a long term investment in my cognitive and bodily health.

I wasn't going to post but decided I should for the sake of accountability. I usually hold myself more accountable when I've made a promise to someone. So I'm keeping you all in the loop or at least keeping a record of this decision here. If anyone here is at a similar point on their journey, being your first day or a few days in then let me know in the comments. Or if you are reading this and considering whether to take the plunge, maybe this is your sign. 

Maybe you've been back and forth and occasionally browse this sub knowing it is the right choice but not feeling ready to kick it right now. Don't let caffeine be your master. You are more than the chemical release that caffeine gives you. Let go and rediscover yourself. There's more light on the other side.

I've almost forgotten what it's like myself. About to go into the woods so wish me luck. Props to everyone who is soldiering through. Stay true.",2,1756516757.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

I know the age gap is scary for some but I grew up in a bad situation and wanted to be with someone that had their life together and I am the first woman he has been with that is younger than him. We fought in the beginning like most couples do but after a few months things were really good. After about 2 years we had a son and things were good. After about 2 more years we were arguing a lot because he lost his job and I was always working to pay the bills while he looked for work. I liked being dropped off at work next to the building so I could have a smoke and listen to music for a few minutes to just reset from my day at home and mentally prepare for my shift. Because of that he would accuse me of cheating or being embarrassed of him‚Ä¶neither was true I just wanted a couple minutes for myself because it was the only time during the day I could have it. Things got so bad we separated for a year and I stayed in the house just separate sleeping arrangements. I started going out with friends again to avoid seeing him and fighting and I would spend all the time I could with my son while he was gone to work. He was constantly trying to see what I was doing or who I was talking to and it was toxic. Around 6 months into the separation he backed off and we were able to start getting along again and after a year we decided to repair things. We talked through our problems and apologized and moved on. After another 2 years we had a daughter and unlike having our son he wasn‚Äôt as attentive or helpful to me. Both my deliveries were C-Sections and our daughters was the worst. By the time I had her and we got settled into our room and all the necessary after birth testing and vaccinations were done I had been up for close to 24 hours and I was tired. He slept which was fine but our daughter didn‚Äôt sleep the first night and when I woke him for help because I was fresh from surgery and having a hard time getting around he got really upset so I stayed up until around 9 after he got up and got coffee and continued to get up every couple hours to feed even though my milk wasn‚Äôt in yet and we were using formula bottles. Fast forward to coming home we kept having issues getting her to sleep and if she woke him up he would just wake me up and still to this day a year later I do all the bathes for both kids and almost all the diaper changes for our daughter I potty trained our son myself I do all the feedings when I am home and I get them both to bed every night and I work full time I get up at 3:30 every morning and don‚Äôt get back to sleep until around 11 PM I don‚Äôt ask much from this man just little things like help me wash my pumps take out the trash and help me out by making the bed before I come home. Our son is homeschooled but it doesn‚Äôt take much time at all to do it. I do his school work with him on my days off and help finish his assignments when I get home from work while feeding his sister after I make the bed and any time I ask for him to do something he gets bugged and tells me I am obsessed with the bed or washing the pumps is annoying or I don‚Äôt let him relax or he can never just sit and it makes me feel crazy like I ask too much of him but I do my best not to bother and he still finds a reason to be upset.

*Creating harmony in our most important relationships*

---

## The Universal Quest for Connection üåü

Every human being, regardless of background or belief system, shares one fundamental desire: to belong to something meaningful. While the world around us constantly changes‚Äîtechnology evolves, societies transform, and values shift‚Äîthe basic human need for connection remains constant. This is where the concept of an ideal family structure becomes not just relevant, but essential.

What makes a family structure truly effective isn't adherence to any particular tradition or doctrine, but rather its ability to nurture growth, provide security, and create lasting bonds that weather life's inevitable storms.

## Beyond Traditional Labels: What Really Matters üí≠

When we strip away cultural expectations and societal pressures, we discover that successful families‚Äîregardless of their composition‚Äîshare certain fundamental characteristics. These aren't mystical principles or ancient wisdom; they're practical, observable patterns that emerge wherever humans thrive together.

The most resilient families operate like well-functioning teams. They have clear roles, open communication channels, mutual respect, and shared goals. They adapt to challenges without losing their core identity, and they support individual growth while maintaining collective strength.

## The Foundation Stones: Five Essential Elements üèóÔ∏è

### 1. Clear Communication Pathways üí¨

In any successful family unit, information flows freely and honestly. This means creating regular opportunities for every member to express their thoughts, concerns, and aspirations without fear of judgment or dismissal.

**Daily Application:**
- Establish device-free meal times where conversation can happen naturally
- Create weekly family meetings to discuss schedules, concerns, and celebrations
- Practice active listening‚Äîtruly hearing what others say rather than preparing your response
- Address conflicts directly but respectfully, focusing on solutions rather than blame

### 2. Defined Roles and Responsibilities üéØ

Every member of a functional family knows what's expected of them and understands how their contributions matter to the whole. This isn't about rigid hierarchy, but about creating structure that allows everyone to feel valuable and accountable.

**Daily Application:**
- Assign age-appropriate tasks that contribute to household functioning
- Rotate responsibilities to prevent resentment and build diverse skills
- Recognize and appreciate each person's unique contributions
- Allow roles to evolve as circumstances and capabilities change

### 3. Mutual Support Systems ü§ù

Strong families act as each other's safety nets. They celebrate successes together and provide comfort during failures. This support isn't conditional on performance or behavior‚Äîit's a fundamental commitment to each other's wellbeing.

**Daily Application:**
- Show up for important events, even when it's inconvenient
- Offer help before it's asked for
- Create traditions that reinforce your bond as a unit
- Stand together when facing external challenges

### 4. Individual Growth Within Unity üå±

The healthiest families balance togetherness with independence. They encourage each member to develop their unique talents and pursue personal goals while maintaining connection to the family unit.

**Daily Application:**
- Support individual hobbies and interests, even when they differ from your own
- Encourage calculated risks and learning from failures
- Celebrate personal achievements as family victories
- Allow privacy and personal space while maintaining openness

### 5. Adaptability and Resilience üîÑ

Life constantly presents new challenges, opportunities, and changes. Families that thrive over time are those that can adapt their structures and strategies while preserving their core relationships and values.

**Daily Application:**
- View problems as puzzles to solve together rather than threats to avoid
- Learn from mistakes without dwelling on them
- Adjust expectations based on changing circumstances
- Focus on what you can control rather than what you cannot

## The Economic Reality: Financial Harmony üí∞

Money often becomes a source of family tension, but it doesn't have to be. Successful families treat finances as a shared responsibility and opportunity for teaching practical life skills.

**Creating Financial Stability:**
- Involve all age-appropriate members in budget discussions
- Teach the difference between wants and needs through real examples
- Set collective financial goals that benefit everyone
- Model good financial habits through daily decisions
- Use money challenges as learning opportunities rather than sources of stress

## Decision-Making That Works for Everyone üó≥Ô∏è

In effective families, decisions aren't made by decree but through a process that considers everyone's needs and capabilities. This doesn't mean every choice requires a committee meeting, but it does mean that significant decisions involve appropriate consultation and explanation.

**Daily Application:**
- Explain the reasoning behind rules and decisions
- Give everyone a voice in choices that affect them
- Teach decision-making skills through age-appropriate opportunities
- Show how individual choices impact the whole family
- Accept that not every decision will make everyone happy, but everyone should understand why it was made

## Handling Conflict Constructively ‚öñÔ∏è

Disagreements are inevitable in any close relationship. What matters isn't avoiding conflict, but handling it in ways that strengthen rather than damage relationships.

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
- Address issues when emotions are calm, not in the heat of the moment
- Focus on specific behaviors rather than character attacks
- Look for win-win solutions that address everyone's core needs
- Apologize sincerely when you make mistakes
- Forgive genuinely when others do the same

## The Technology Balance üì±

In our increasingly connected world, families must navigate the challenge of staying connected to each other while managing digital distractions. The goal isn't to eliminate technology, but to use it intentionally rather than letting it use you.

**Creating Tech Harmony:**
- Establish tech-free zones and times
- Use technology to strengthen family connections, not replace them
- Model healthy digital habits
- Teach critical thinking about online content
- Create engaging offline activities that compete with screen time

## Building Traditions That Bind üéä

Meaningful traditions aren't inherited‚Äîthey're created through consistent, intentional actions that reinforce your family's unique identity and values. These don't need to be elaborate or expensive; they just need to be regular and meaningful.

**Tradition-Building Ideas:**
- Weekly game nights or movie nights
- Annual camping trips or special outings
- Holiday celebrations that reflect your family's personality
- Regular volunteer activities that serve your community
- Monthly one-on-one time between different family members

## Preparing for the Future üöÄ

The strongest families don't just survive the present‚Äîthey prepare each member to succeed independently while maintaining lifelong connections. This means intentionally developing skills, character, and relationships that will serve everyone well throughout their lives.

**Future-Focused Practices:**
- Teach practical life skills progressively as children grow
- Model the kind of relationships you want your family members to seek
- Encourage education and skill development for all family members
- Build connections with your broader community
- Plan for major life transitions before they arrive

## When Structure Needs to Change üîß

Sometimes family structures that once worked well need to be modified. This might happen due to job changes, health issues, educational opportunities, or simply because people grow and change. Recognizing when change is needed and implementing it thoughtfully is a sign of family strength, not weakness.

**Navigating Change:**
- Acknowledge when current systems aren't working
- Include affected family members in planning changes
- Implement modifications gradually when possible
- Maintain core relationship commitments even as logistics shift
- View change as growth rather than loss

## The Ripple Effect: How Strong Families Strengthen Communities üåä

Families don't exist in isolation. The stronger individual families become, the healthier their communities become. This creates a positive cycle where strong families contribute to stable neighborhoods, effective schools, and thriving local economies, which in turn support family success.

**Community Connection:**
- Participate in local organizations and events
- Build relationships with neighbors
- Support local businesses and institutions
- Volunteer for causes that matter to your family
- Model citizenship and civic engagement

## Measuring Success: What Actually Matters üìä

The effectiveness of any family structure shouldn't be measured by external appearances or comparisons to others, but by internal outcomes: Are family members growing into capable, caring people? Do they feel secure and valued? Are they equipped to contribute positively to the world?

**True Success Indicators:**
- Family members choose to spend time together even when not required
- Everyone feels heard and valued
- Individual growth happens alongside relationship strength
- Challenges are faced together rather than avoided or endured alone
- The family serves as a launching pad for positive community involvement

## The Long View: Building Something That Lasts üèõÔ∏è

The most important question any family can ask isn't ""What works right now?"" but ""What will serve us well across decades?"" The strongest family structures are those that remain relevant and effective as children grow up, as parents age, and as circumstances inevitably change.

This long-term perspective influences daily decisions. It means prioritizing relationship quality over immediate convenience, teaching skills over providing services, and building character over accumulating possessions.

## Starting Where You Are üå±

You don't need to overhaul everything at once to begin building a stronger family structure. Small, consistent changes often create more lasting transformation than dramatic restructuring. Start with one area where improvement would make the biggest difference, implement changes gradually, and build on successes.

Remember, there's no perfect family structure‚Äîonly structures that work better for the people in them. The goal isn't to achieve some external standard, but to create an environment where every family member can thrive and contribute to something larger than themselves.

The path forward isn't about following someone else's blueprint, but about thoughtfully constructing something that serves your unique collection of people, circumstances, and aspirations. The tools and principles remain consistent across cultures and generations, but their application is as individual as the families that use them.

What matters most isn't where you start, but that you start‚Äîand that you keep building, adjusting, and improving as you learn what works best for the people you love most.

I‚Äôve been battling with this question for a while and I need a reality check‚Äîso I‚Äôm laying it all out. Would appreciate any honest input.

There‚Äôs this woman at work I‚Äôve developed a serious crush on over the past few months. We‚Äôve never spoken, but there‚Äôs been a lot of eye contact and non-verbal stuff that‚Äôs made me confused about whether she might be interested, or if I‚Äôm just projecting. Here's a breakdown of what I‚Äôve noticed:

Prolonged glances: When we used to sit across each other at work, I often caught her glancing at me through the reflection of my monitor. Some of these lasted 3‚Äì4 seconds, especially when I wasn‚Äôt looking.

Energy shift: Her energy often seemed to change when she saw me‚Äîshe‚Äôd get more animated or conscious in a way I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

Deliberate proximity: A few times she chose to sit or stand near me even when other spots were available, but would still avoid direct eye contact.

Waving at my friend only when I‚Äôm with him: She knows my colleague but only waves at him when he‚Äôs with me. When he‚Äôs alone, she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge him.

Nervousness?: When I try to look at her or hold eye contact, she sometimes looks away quickly or seems flustered. But at other times, she‚Äôd hold eye contact and seem a bit more composed.

Recent change: Lately, she‚Äôs been acting distant. No glances, no proximity. Not sure if I gave off the wrong vibe by not initiating a conversation earlier.


We‚Äôre both professionals and I‚Äôve been hesitant to initiate anything at work to keep it respectful. But now I feel I might‚Äôve lost the moment entirely. I‚Äôm stuck in my head over this.

So here‚Äôs my question:
Is this worth pursuing‚Äîor is it all just in my head? Is it even safe to approach her and say something casual like ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôve been curious about you‚Äîwould you be open to grabbing a coffee sometime?‚Äù

I just don‚Äôt want to cross a line or misread someone and make them uncomfortable. Any advice is welcome‚Äîespecially from women or anyone who‚Äôs been in similar shoes.",1,1756515781.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1n3oijf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n3oijf/aitah_not_meeting_with_online_friend_after_they/,AITAH Not meeting with online friend after they travelled here?,"Earlier this year, I invited an online friend of 5 yrs to come hang out in my city for a week. At the time, I meant as a friendship as he has a long term gf and I thought it would just be fun to finally meet up and offered him to sleep in my extra room.

Not long after the invite, he asked if he could take me out on a date. I was surprised and asked if he was still with his partner. He said yes, but that they were poly (he‚Äôd never told me this). I told him that I wasn‚Äôt sure poly was really for me and I hadn‚Äôt been involved in something like that before. Basically, I didn‚Äôt say yes. I was cautious, but polite.

Then he booked tickets almost right away and messaged me saying it was ‚Äúa bit more expensive‚Äù than he expected. I told him if it was too much, he didn‚Äôt have to come, and that I was rethinking inviting people from online to stay in my home anyway (as I now felt weird inviting a man from the internet with a crush on me to stay in my house). He brushed that off and asked if I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with him staying at my place, adding he could get a hotel if I preferred. That was the first time I really felt pushed.

A few days later, on Valentine‚Äôs Day, he sent me this long message about how he had a crush on me, thought I was pretty, loved my voice, etc. I responded politely by saying I appreciate him and happy to hear these things but that I didn‚Äôt want to flirt back, I wasn‚Äôt into poly, and it was best to keep things platonic to avoid confusion. He then said if I change my mind he‚Äôd love to cuddle me on the couch and look into my eyes‚Ä¶ at that point I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what to say at this point lol‚Äù and he just apologized and called himself an idiot. 

Months later, in May, he messaged again about the August trip. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt be able to meet but that I‚Äôd like to visit his country one day instead. He said he‚Äôd already paid for flights and would ‚Äúprobably still come to visit for a week anyways.‚Äù I reminded him that I‚Äôd already said no back in February, and asked him if he could still cancel or refund the tickets. He replied that there was no refund and basically tried to blame me, saying I should‚Äôve been ‚Äúmore forward‚Äù and that it was a ‚Äúhuge miscommunication.‚Äù

At that point, I got blunt. I told him I invited him as a friend, but he suddenly turned it into dating after I‚Äôd already invited him to my home, and that I‚Äôd tried multiple times to politely cancel but he continued pushing. He sent me a long apology about how he didn‚Äôt mean to make me uncomfortable, didn‚Äôt want to come across as a creep, and that it was a big miscommunication. I never replied, and I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since.

Then recently, I found out he still flew to here. He didn‚Äôt message me about meeting up while he was here, but he is telling my other online friends that he just got back from my country and that he‚Äôll discuss it privately.

Now I feel conflicted. On one hand, people can travel wherever they want, and he didn‚Äôt try to meet me directly after the apology. On the other hand, the only reason he booked this trip in the first place was me, and he ignored multiple rejections and clearly managed to book a hotel while claiming he was struggling with money and that‚Äôs why he wanted to stay with me.

I‚Äôm also anxious that he might be dropping breadcrumbs for others to ask about it, and that he could spin the story as me ghosting him. All I did was invite a friend to hang out, and it‚Äôs turned into this.

So, AITA for ignoring his apology and not meeting up with him when he came here? Should I have at least gotten coffee with him since he came all this way, or was I right to cut contact? I think he might be telling my other friends about this and I wish this would all disappear. ",3,1756515583.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Quite suddenly, everything changed in our lives when he was diagnosed with hypersomnia.   It's very painful to watch him suffer and I've come to understand that hypersomnia doesn't easily allow him to initiate ways to overcome how our life together had changed.  Suddenly, we're both more alone - he in bed trying to decompress from his meds and find the downtime to rest and to sleep - me up at night worrying, feeling a bit lost without his company, chastising myself for resenting the changes we're facing, getting tearful and generally feeling a bit lost.  I think we have both tried sitting on our feelings and going with the flow, in hopes we'll find out feet, but I'm realising communication is absolutely key.  Please give me your advice, based on your experience and relationships, of how I can best support him, and indeed, communicate my own feelings without making him feel worse.  We have been together for 25 years, and I will step up, whatever it takes; my marriage vows only gave words to the love and dedication I naturally feel: nothing will part us if I have anything to do with it, and I'm here for him no matter what.  

So far, I've tried the following:

We have a cleaner come once every two week, otherwise, I keep the house together.

I cook dinner every night - and luckily I love cooking and cooking for him, making cups of tea etc

I try to make his lunches, because I know he doesn't eat well during his work day, but sometimes I'm myself, too tired to keep up with that.  

I set up the coffee and cups most nights, ready for the morning, so if he's up before me, it's all laid out.

He's been drinking most evenings, I think because alcohol gives him an uplift, so I have rehydration drinks ready in the morning.  I've stopped drinking myself knowing that will help him drink less, which is the case! 

I try to do most of the driving.

I try and set up dates for seeing people we have socialised with in the past as I don't want him to isolate himself.  I try to take the weight of socialising in terms of keeping conversation going etc.  And stay up with people if he has to go to bed.  

I got the sense he doesn't often have the energy and clear-headedness to ensure he's getting the right medical support, so we made an appointment with his doctor to try more angles.  I CAN'T BELIEVE they have just left him to cope with no support.  I told the doctor, if my husband had another disability, wouldn't you offer him interventions to help him cope with a life-changing diagnosis?  I CAN'T BELIEVE the doctors said ""well, he could take a couple of weeks off the meds to ensure he doesn't become somewhat immune."".  He obviously has no damn idea what he's going through to continue working and earning.  I did get one win, which was to involve my partner in stress and anxiety therapy.  I know it's not the root of the problem, but he needs someone he can talk to that isn't emotionally tied up in it all as i am.  

We don't have sexual relations any more and nor do we have those intimate bedtime chats.  Both have always been a way we come together for comfort and talk any issues through before they take root.  

I'm just re-orientating to understand that when he's not making much sense in conversation, doesn't appear to be listening, is yawing when I'm talking, has to disappear suddenly to bed etc isn't due to what we are socialised to believe - that I'm the problem, that our relationship is the problem, that he's just bored and uninterested.  

But I still feel I could do more - I'm just worried about doing too much.  I could drive him to work, I could try and work with his schedule so we have more intimacy.  I'm even hoping my new business venture works so I can offer him the option of not working at all.  Can you help?  What more can I do that is helpful?  How can I make his life better, be a better husband myself, without taking his life away by taking everything over?  Thank you for any input you can give.  He's a great man and I want to help him be content with our life together.  ",1,1756515565.0,idiopathichypersomnia,0,1.0,False

Hi Reddit. I‚Äôve been wrestling with this situation at work and could really use some outside perspective. I‚Äôve had a subtle but intense connection (or at least I thought so) with a woman at my workplace over the last few months. We've never spoken directly, but the non-verbal energy between us has been‚Ä¶ strange. Here are some key observations and moments ‚Äî I'm genuinely curious if these mean something or if I‚Äôve just been overanalyzing everything.

The signs I noticed:

It started with eye contact ‚Äî long glances from her side. I sit near her and could often see her reflection on my monitor. Through that, I noticed she would look at me for 3‚Äì4 seconds, multiple times a day, when I wasn‚Äôt looking. When I did catch her, she‚Äôd often look away quickly, but sometimes hold it just for a moment longer.

Once, I tried to subtly nod at her ‚Äî she looked, but quickly looked away, which made me unsure.

On several occasions, she walked into my vicinity despite having other easier routes or seating options. She'd stand nearby ‚Äúlooking at her phone‚Äù for longer than normal, even when it wasn‚Äôt necessary.

One day at lunch, she was done eating with her colleague, but instead of leaving with them, she stayed back standing just a few feet from me pretending to be occupied with her phone for 45+ seconds. I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was a window to approach her.

She never waves or acknowledges this one colleague(she is aquainted with) of mine when he's alone(he himself brought that up). But whenever he‚Äôs with me and we cross her path, she smiles and waves at him most of the times. She never waves at me directly though. It feels like she might be using him to indirectly acknowledge my presence.

There have also been subtle changes in her energy around me ‚Äî sometimes flustered or nervous, like flipping her hair or adjusting her posture when passing by. She doesn‚Äôt seem to do that with others.

The tension has escalated now to the point where we barely make eye contact anymore. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre both acting as if the other person doesn‚Äôt exist.


Where I failed:

I‚Äôve been too nervous to approach her. Every time there was a perfect opportunity, I froze.

I overthought everything ‚Äî what to say, how to say it, whether she‚Äôd be uncomfortable, whether I was reading too much into it.

Now I feel she might have completely withdrawn, maybe thinking I was never interested in the first place.


My question: Did she expect me to make a move? Were these signals genuine or just friendly? Is it too late? Would it be weird or inappropriate if I just went up and said hi or asked her out for a casual coffee?

I‚Äôm afraid of misreading cues and making her uncomfortable, but I also don‚Äôt want to regret never trying. What would you do?",1,1756515416.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1n3ofri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3ofri,"Got some ice cream, but it both melted and had a bug fly onto it on the way back. The ice cream sloshed onto the bug several times.","I went to McDonald‚Äôs today and got a Vanilla Cone (because it‚Äôs $1, so why wouldn‚Äôt I?).

It came on a cone but was put in a cup for no reason (MAYBE because of the heat, but it‚Äôs still random), which I didn‚Äôt ask for at all, and I actually used to do this myself when it was super hot out, but this is bad because I was planning on eating it after leaving while walking.

While it was melting because it‚Äôs 30¬∞C outside, some small flying bug with wings flew onto the cone and wasn‚Äôt moving, so it was definitely dead. I did want to take a photo of that, but I was holding the ice cream cup and another cup and was on the sidewalk, so I couldn‚Äôt.

At first, the bug was dry and untouched, but because the ice cream was literally progressively melting since it was ridiculously hot, it just became more liquified, and the volume rose. And because I was walking for 20-30 minutes while holding another item (a cup of iced coffee) and walking up slopes, I couldn‚Äôt really control the position of the cup, and the liquified ice cream drenched the bug several times.

The ice cream just ALL melted, a bug flew onto it, and it was covered in my ice cream who knows how many times. Well, that sucks.

After the first time the ice cream covered the bug, or when I noticed it happened, I was worried the bug actually got into the ice cream, but thankfully it just stuck to the cone the whole time. When I got back, I scraped the bug off, and I was relieved when I got the entire thing off. I wasn‚Äôt sure the whole basically half an hour I was walking back whether or not this was safe to eat, but I‚Äôm consuming it as cope. I also coped by mashing the cone into the ice cream since I was pretty pissed and it was covered in ice cream from the movement of the cup from earlier anyways.

I feel like this could‚Äôve been prevented if it just didn‚Äôt come in the cup. I would‚Äôve just started eating it, and the bug probably wouldn‚Äôt have flown on. As I‚Äôm writing this, I just realized it‚Äôs a sundae cup‚Ä¶ üíÄ

My bad for not being able to get a good photo of the bug guys, but hopefully this doesn‚Äôt seem stupider than it is.

**tl;dr**: Ice cream came with a cone in a cup randomly, a bug flew onto the cone (I thought it was on the ice cream at first), and the ice cream increasingly melted, drenching the bug multiple times. I‚Äôm eating it for some reason because I‚Äôm pissed.",0,1756515353.0,Wellthatsucks,6,0.36,False

I live in Phoenix, AZ and Banh mi costs around 4.5 buck and a big ass coffee cup costs around $4. Housing costs around 400k for 3bd single family home.

In HCM a good Banh mi now cost about $1.5-$2. A cup of coffee cost around $2. a 3bd apt cost about $250k. Yes it is still cheaper than US but also less opportunity etc and I dont want to fly 10000 miles to save 2 buck of coffee per day.
