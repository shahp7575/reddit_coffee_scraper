**Title:** Just Listened to *The Brain Song*… and Wow, Here’s My Honest Review  

Hey folks,  

So I stumbled across something called **“The Brain Song”** recently while going down one of those late-night productivity rabbit holes. I didn’t expect much—thought it’d be some cheesy motivational track. But turns out, it actually *hit different*.  

The track isn’t just music—it’s an experience that sort of rewires how you think about focus and creativity. You know when something just gets your mind buzzing in the right frequency? That’s what this did for me. I had it on repeat while doing some freelancing tasks; not only did I feel more energized, but I actually *finished* my work without the mid-afternoon slump.  

I did some digging and found out it’s part of this wild experiment on sound and brainwaves. If you’re curious about how music can impact your mental flow or productivity, you owe it to yourself to check it out here:

What I respect most is that it isn’t hyped up as a “magic fix”—it’s more about exploring how small shifts in mental state can change how we work, think, and feel. Honest truth? I’ve listened to it every morning for the past week and noticed consistent motivation without relying on endless cups of coffee.  

Here’s the link again because, honestly, you should give it a few minutes of your time:

Whether you’re freelancing, side-hustling, or just trying to stay focused while navigating online job chaos, try plugging in your headphones and see how your brain responds. If it clicks, you might have discovered your new go-to soundtrack for “flow state mode.”

I do have some experience building furniture, but I never build with spruce before.

  
I´ll need to build a bed, side table, wardrobe, TV table, coffee table. Yeah basically all new because I´m moving in by the end of the year with my girl :3. I´m only bringing my computer desk :D.

  
But I´m broke and of course the first go to place was IKEA and I feel scammed. Here in my area they ask for a 160x200cm bed like 250€ and that bed is super flimsy. My memories haunt me as well as I have broken a few IKEA beds myself before. So either I pay 250 for a bed that is made from cardboard and particleboard (yes the description said that) or I can build it myself for around 150-200€ from solid spruce and much more solid and probably strong enough to hold 3 or 4 people. I feel like IKEA´s stability test is made with some skinny short person, because the bed holds like 110-150kg for 2 people... WTF ? sure the average person weighs 55-75kg very realistic. 

And well as I´m broke going with IKEA´s cheapest option means 90% of the time cardboard and a few particleboard pieces.

  
So I could build it from spruce which is the cheapest option and even in some cases cheaper than IKEA. But the problem is I don´t know how spruce behaves. Like does it take stains well ? I would like a brownish stain instead of that bright natural tone. Also how well does it take shellac or other finishes (prefering shellac) ? 

  
The alternative is douglas fir which looks great in my opinion, but it would cost a little more than ikea, but again it´s douglas fir so definitely stronger than spruce or cardboard.

  
I´m not gonna build anything fancy. I´ll be getting the lumber from the big box store here around. I´m more concerned about stability. As for looks if it looks like real wood and I can stain it to darken the tone, then I´m already happy. I mean even IKEA´s wood looks is veneer on cardboard or particleboard. So why not pick real solid wood instead ?

I don´t care if the spruce is soft and therefore easily gets damaged and dangs. It´s just character. But I do care about the stability, that´s my major concern. Of course it depends on the design as well, but I mean cardboard ain´t that stable. ",1,1770978417.0,woodworking,1,1.0,False

1r3lmw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r3lmw5/how_to_tell_if_youre_actually_attractive_even_if/,How to Tell If You're Actually Attractive (Even If You Don't Feel Like It),"Spent way too much time researching this because I kept seeing friends with incredible qualities totally miss how attractive they actually are. Like, genuinely baffled by their own appeal. So I went down a rabbit hole through psychology research, evolutionary biology studies, and honestly, some really good YouTube rabbit holes about human behavior.



Here's what actually makes someone attractive, and spoiler alert, it's probably not what you think.



\## \*\*You make people feel comfortable being themselves\*\*



This one hit different when I learned about it. There's actual research on ""emotional contagion"" showing how we mirror the energy of people around us. When someone feels safe enough to drop their guard around you, that's magnetic as hell.



\*\*[The Charisma Myth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)\*\* by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down beautifully. She's a charisma coach who worked with executives at places like Google and Harvard. The book destroys the myth that charisma is something you're born with. One of her biggest points? Presence beats performance every time. When you're genuinely interested in what someone's saying instead of planning your next witty comeback, people feel it. That authentic attention is insanely attractive.



Makes sense when you think about it. We're all walking around with social anxiety wondering if we're weird or boring or too much. The person who makes you forget that worry for a minute? That's the person you want to be around.



\## \*\*You have specific passions that light you up\*\*



Not talking about being ""well rounded"" or having acceptable hobbies. I mean that thing you nerd out about so hard you lose track time.



Evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller talks about this in his work on sexual selection. Humans are attracted to displays of skill and dedication because it signals intelligence, discipline, creativity. Doesn't matter if you're into mechanical keyboards, obscure indie bands, or perfecting your sourdough starter. The enthusiasm itself is what's attractive.



Point is, being really into something makes you interesting. Being apologetic about your interests makes you forgettable.



\## \*\*You don't need constant validation to function\*\*



Okay this one's tough because we ALL want validation. But there's research from attachment theory showing that secure people, the ones who aren't constantly seeking approval, are rated as more attractive across the board.



\*\*Attached\*\* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller gets into this. Both authors are psychiatrists and neuroscientists who studied thousands of relationships. The book explains how people with secure attachment styles (basically, comfortable being close but also comfortable being independent) consistently attract and maintain better relationships. Not because they're playing hard to get, but because their self worth isn't entirely dependent on external approval.



This doesn't mean being cold or aloof. It means you can receive a compliment without immediately deflecting it or fishing for more. You can sit alone at a coffee shop without your phone as a security blanket. You can be genuinely happy for someone else's success without it triggering your own insecurity.



If you want to actually build these traits instead of just reading about them, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content based on what you're trying to work on. Like if you type in ""I'm an introvert who wants to be more magnetic in social situations,"" it'll build you a custom learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are surprisingly good too, there's even this smoky, conversational style that makes listening way less like studying and more like having an actual interesting conversation. It connects insights from books like the ones mentioned here with practical psychology research, so you're not just passively consuming, you're actually building skills that stick.



\## \*\*You're consistent in how you treat people\*\*



Not just nice to people you want something from. Not just kind when you're in a good mood. Consistently decent across contexts and situations.



Social psychology research shows we're constantly scanning for authenticity markers. One of the biggest? Behavioral consistency. When someone's personality shifts dramatically based on who's in the room, it triggers mistrust on a subconscious level.



\*\*The Social Skills Guidebook\*\* by [Chris MacLeod](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) covers this well. He's a therapist who specializes in social anxiety and awkwardness. The book's full of practical observations about what actually builds trust and attraction in social settings. One insight that stuck: people are drawn to those who have integrity even in small moments. Treating the server the same way you treat your boss. Being honest about small things when lying would be easier.



It's not about being perfect. It's about being reliably yourself.



\## \*\*You take care of yourself in unglamorous ways\*\*



Instagram shows us highlight reels of green smoothies and 5am gym sessions. Real attractiveness is going to therapy even when it's hard. Getting enough sleep even when Netflix has three more episodes. Saying no to social plans when you're genuinely drained.



When you're meeting your own basic needs, managing your mental health, setting boundaries, you show up differently. You're not desperately looking for someone else to fix what's broken. You're not running on empty hoping someone will fill your tank. That self sufficiency mixed with openness to connection? That's the sweet spot.



\---



Look, the science backs this up but here's the real thing. You're probably more attractive than you think because you're comparing your messy insides to everyone else's curated outsides. You know all your weird anxious thoughts and embarrassing moments. They just see someone who's probably more put together than they feel.



Most attractive quality of all? Believing you have something valuable to offer and acting like it, even when your brain's telling you otherwise.",1,1770978090.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

1r3lmkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/noseyneighbours/comments/1r3lmkt/i_offered_to_pay_the_full_amount_for_our_boundary/,I offered to pay the full amount for our boundary fence.. they insisted it be short so they can see.,"My partner & I bought our first house to move into with our two little boys & small dog. One of my first jobs was to fence the perimeter of the property, for obvious reasons. I only have two neighbours one house was happy for me to build the fence I wanted & the others who happened to live in this big 2 story brick home were not so keen (old couple). They told me initially that they didn't think it was necessary for me to fence my property. I quickly made it clear to them that I will be in fact fencing my property as I have my dog & two boys & partner that will be living there. I told them I'm planning on building a timber paling fence something like 1.7m tall. They half freaked out and told me it would ruin the view from their driveway. So our boundary when I moved in was completely overgrown. I spent days hand pulling weeds and pruning trees so I could access the boundary but also it desperately needed attention. The weeds were obstructing the view from a bedroom window from their house that looks straight into my kids bedroom. I was very eager for a tall fence to disrupt this view. Also, from the front of their house there are trees between their property and ours, so it wouldn't have made much of a difference if there was a tall or short fence there.. the tiny pathway down the side of their house that looks into my house and backyard was what was really being impacted and I obviously was eager to obstruct this view. I have even heard them instruct their gardener to cut their little hedge ""right down so we can see over them"". 

Anyway to the point, I caved and built a smaller fence just to stay on their good side which they appreciated but before too long I was needing to put a new window in the kitchen to allow more light into the house but unfortunately the window being in the kitchen meant that they can now see straight through my home and also into my kids room from one of their downstairs bedrooms. We haven't yet put a little curtain up in the kitchen but we close the timber louvres in the boys room very often.

It wouldn't be much of an issue for us however, ever since we put the window in we are constantly finding the elderly couple looking through the window and straight into our home. The old fella hasn't been well and I'm pretty sure he now uses that room as his bedroom to save walking upstairs. His family was recently there and staying in that room and his sister who was standing at the window for ages staring straight into my house. My visiting Nonna said to me ""oh my we're being watched"". I got up from the table walked into the kitchen & raised my coffee to the woman as if to say g'day wtf are you staring at? She barely reacted at all.. it's like she was looking straight through me. After what felt like a minute of awkward eye contact she turned and disappeared. 

The neighbours are a friendly old couple & the woman comes over from time to time see my partner & say hello to the kids so we haven't said anything. After all a curtain would fix the issue but that's not the point.

 It has been annoying me, so I'll tell you what I've been doing as payback for looking into my home so obviously & frequently...

At night when the kids are asleep, I'm in the kitchen finishing tidying up and making cups of tea for my partner and I, usually once the cleaning is done I'm smashing some exercise on the floor whilst the kettle boils. Nowadays, I just do it naked. Bugga him. Sometimes I'll grab a chair and wipe/dust the light in the kitchen or the fan. When I'm exercising I'll smash some skipping on the spot and subsequently I'm doing the helicopter. It's not gay, he bloody hates it I can tell. I see him get all grumpy and quickly shut his curtains. So now usually when I'm home from work on my 5 days off he just shuts his curtains each afternoon. My partner told me that they don't seem to be looking in much anymore. Every now and then he slacks & leaves the curtain open and I'll straight up begin to undress in the kitchen and very quickly the curtain closes. 

You might not agree with my methods but I feel I handled the situation fairly. He absolutely has no view outside that window at night except for what's going on through my window.

FYI His wife rarely is in that room and if she is it's not at night.. I'm not helicoptering her.. I have morals.",1,1770978059.0,noseyneighbours,0,1.0,False

I haven't taken a math or science class since high school (!17 years ago!) and have a BFA in the arts so I was really nervous about taking the exam.  I studied for 2 months using the ATI prep book, A&P test and tests A and B , Mometrix online (free) material and practice tests. I purchased the ATI app as well as the Mastery app and ended up only using the science questions (about 500-600 each i think) for both.  The official study guide was not sufficient material for the questions they ask and Mometrix was overly complex for TEAS material.  The whole ATI platform IMO sucks- the app itself is crappy and outdated, the questions asked (wording, answers are not always straightforward).  Mastery app was decent in explaining answers and related concepts with videos/explanations/diagrams for each Q. For concepts I struggled with or needed to brush up on, I watched Amoeba Sisters, Tyler DeWitt, Nurse Cheung and Siebert Science videos on youtube- there are practice questions on the Amoeba Sisters channel and Tyler DeWitt's youtube shorts that were helpful in reviewing topics.  I tried podcasts, but got bored and tuned out really quick.  ADHD adult and visual learner here- I found that using post-its while taking notes was useful bc I could pick these condensed vs of notes out of my notebook and put them up all over my kitchen, bathroom and living room in spots where I'd be lingering anyway. I made old fashioned flash cards from index cards and reviewed those when I was out and about and had a few minutes of downtime. I generally don't trust AI with making practice questions up, however I did ask chat to explain certain concepts to me in ""laymans terms"" but MORE IMPORTANTLY, to do it in the voice of my hero, RuPaul Charles. 

That being said, I still did not have enough time to prepare for my goal score on the science section as I'm applying to a very competitive CC program.  I screwed up when I scheduled my first exam by making the appt at a university that only allowed registered students to test there and could not, despite multiple attempts, get my money back.  I knew I wasn't on the level of preparedness that I desired today but I didn't want to flush another 130$ down the drain.  

Reading and english have always come naturally to me so I didn't study for those besides the practice test questions.  The questions I got incorrect were usually a result of rushing through the questions and answers- I kept having to remind myself to READ EVERY SINGLE WORD, as many times as you need to bc on the practice tests I'd be kicking myself for getting a question wrong bc I missed one word in the question.  Think about what type of question they are asking before even looking at the answers and flag every single one if you need to.  Math was pretty straightforward. I was worried about memorizing conversions since idk my metric conversions as well as i should, but all of the conversions on the exam were provided in the question.  I was thrown off by graphs, identifying appropriate graphs for a set of data, and a question regarding something related to football avg yards to kick score idk, but it was just a matter of reading the table provided. The football thing still confused the hell out of me, a total non-sports person. 

I studied mainly for science and my biggest struggle was with chemistry. A&P was a matter of understanding then memorizing concepts for me but idk, something about combining math and science really throws me for a loop.  Types of bonds, properties of solutions, isotopes and atomic charge, chemical equilibrium are topics I will really need to continue to go over and over. There are questions I have flagged in the apps that I will answer incorrectly repeatedly, mostly concerning these topics. It's just a lot of stuff to review and remember and I wish I gave myself more time to study extensively.  On the exam: size comparisons of different cells, identifying ideal microscope type, naming # of ions protons electrons for diff elements, no you don't need to memorize the periodic table. 

  
English I know I could have done better on, but I was feeling discouraged after running out of time and guessing on the last question in the science portion and burnt out by the end of the three hours. I was at a testing center and wish I had  gotten up and took a break after the Math section, but the rules about breaks weren't discussed with the proctor and I already hit the 'continue to next section' button.  I was struggling to sit still and focus and a guy behind me kept whispering what he was reading OUT LOUD and it was really distracting so I kinda just winged this section. 

I took practice tests A (77) & B (73)  a few days before testing and I would say reading and english are about the same level of difficulty as the actual test and math q's were simpler, again no conversions needed to be memorized. Science was about the same difficulty, maybe it felt slightly moreso on the exam because ATI does tend to try to trip you up when asking for detailed specifics on certain concepts through wording.  



Things i wish I did differently:   
\-got more sleep the night before. felt quite burnt out and fatigued by the end.   
\-eat something simple and familiar and healthy before. i had coffee and avo toast but i think it upset my stomach more than it already was from sheer anxiety.   
\- remembered my ATI login info!!  I completely forgot and had to leave the testing room, open locker turn on my phone figure out how to get my password  etc so i was flustered at the very start.   
\-if i had to pick one app i would go with Mastery over ATI and stick w the ATI book instead. It has one comprehensive practice test and practice questions for each short chapter then practice for each portion.. and i believe a QR code with more online practice questions you can access.

That was a lot lol but very cathartic.  Thank you for coming to my ted talk an if anyone would like to ask me anything (besides for exact questions) feel free! Good luck everyone!

I'm trying not to waste a lot of beans in the dialing in phase, and I have a bit of a specific coffee drinking pattern. 

So to describe the problem I'm facing.   
Currently I'm spending most days on campus, writing a master thesis.  
This require good coffee, so I'm bringing a thermos 591ml.   
I'm also trying to limit my coffee intake to 4 cups or 800ml.   
This results in me brewing coffee twice a day.   
First one cup to drink at home (Usually 12g coffee to 200ml of water).   
Then a thermos (36g to 600ml of water).   
Leaving me with 2 tastings a day. And using 48 grams of coffee, a bag of beans are around 225 to 250g, leaving med with 10 possible tastings before I run out of coffee.   
And has to start over. Some times I'm lucky and hit the sweet spot between sour and bitter on day two. Sometimes it take longer. 

I'm justing a Hario V60 and a Mahlkoning X64 grinder.

So my thinking is, what if i could brew like 6 really small cups of coffee on day one, dialing everything in with just a small amount of coffee I would have more good coffee from each bag. 

So the question to you; 

**Is it possible to brew something like a 3g - 50ml cup in the V60?**   
**Or whats the smallest cup (recipe) you have been able to brew with repeatable results?**   


Also interested to know if you usually do some grind size change between a 1 cup pour or a 3 cup pour. ",2,1770977879.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

# Mitolyn Weight Loss Supplement Reviews (2026): Does It Actually Work or Is It Just Hype?

The weight-loss industry is flooded with promises — faster metabolism, effortless fat burning, endless energy. Yet most supplements fail to deliver long-term results.

**Mitolyn** has recently gained massive attention in the health space, with thousands of users claiming improved energy, better metabolism, and noticeable fat loss.

But the real question is:

https://preview.redd.it/ubb0un24m8jg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=427f3d0f0983efb054f5351b569ea6b741075224

👉 **Is Mitolyn truly effective in 2026, or is it just another overhyped supplement?**

Let’s break down the science, ingredients, benefits, complaints, and real customer experiences so you can make an informed decision.

  
👉 [Visit the Mitolyn Official Website](https://en-mitolyn.com/)

# ⭐ Quick Verdict (2026)

**Best For:** People struggling with slow metabolism, low energy, and stubborn fat.

**Not For:** Anyone expecting overnight weight loss.

**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.8/5)

✔ Natural formula  
✔ Stimulant-free  
✔ Targets cellular energy  
✔ Strong customer satisfaction

⚠️ Works gradually, not instantly.

# What is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a modern metabolic support supplement designed to improve how your body produces energy at the cellular level.

Instead of relying on caffeine or aggressive fat burners, Mitolyn focuses on **mitochondria** — the microscopic powerhouses inside your cells responsible for converting food into usable energy.

When mitochondrial function declines (often with age, stress, and poor lifestyle habits), metabolism slows down.

Mitolyn aims to reverse that cycle.

**Primary Goals:**

* Support natural fat burning
* Increase daily energy
* Improve metabolic efficiency
* Encourage sustainable weight control

**Important:** Mitolyn is a dietary supplement — not a drug — and results vary from person to person.

# How Mitolyn Works (Science Simplified)

# 1. Activates Cellular Energy

Mitolyn supports ATP production — the biological “fuel currency” your body uses for movement, brain function, and calorie burning.

More ATP = more usable energy.

# 2. Improves Metabolic Flexibility

A healthy metabolism can switch between burning carbs and fat efficiently. Mitolyn helps encourage this process, making fat easier to use as fuel.

# 3. Encourages Mitochondrial Biogenesis

Some plant compounds in Mitolyn may help your body create new mitochondria — a major factor linked with improved endurance and fat metabolism.

# 4. Avoids Harsh Stimulants

No caffeine spikes.  
No crash cycles.  
No jittery feeling.

Just steady, sustainable energy.

# Core Ingredients Breakdown

# ✅ Maqui Berry

Loaded with anthocyanins that help fight oxidative stress — a hidden contributor to metabolic slowdown.

# ✅ Rhodiola Rosea

A well-known adaptogen linked with reduced fatigue, sharper focus, and better stress resilience.

# ✅ Astaxanthin (Haematococcus)

One of the most powerful natural antioxidants for protecting cellular health.

# ✅ Amla (Indian Gooseberry)

Supports digestion, immunity, and nutrient absorption — all essential for healthy weight regulation.

# ✅ Theobroma Cacao

Improves blood flow and mood while supporting metabolic activity.

# ✅ Schisandra Berry

Traditionally used to enhance stamina, liver health, and long-lasting energy.

👉 **Why this matters:**  
Many fat burners stimulate the nervous system. Mitolyn instead supports the biological systems that *create energy naturally.*

That’s a major difference.

# Top Benefits Users Report

# 🔥 1. Gradual but Noticeable Fat Loss

Rather than dramatic drops, users often experience steady weight reduction — the kind more likely to stay off.

# ⚡ 2. All-Day Energy

No afternoon crashes. No dependence on coffee.

# 🧠 3. Better Mental Clarity

Adaptogens may help stabilize mood and improve focus.

# ❤️ 4. Metabolic & Heart Support

Antioxidant-rich ingredients promote circulation and cellular protection.

# 🏃 5. Improved Physical Stamina

Many users report workouts feeling easier within weeks.

# Pros and Cons

# 👍 Pros

✔ Plant-based formula  
✔ No stimulants  
✔ Supports root metabolic function  
✔ Easy capsule routine  
✔ 90-day refund policy

# 👎 Cons

✖ Not a rapid weight-loss solution  
✖ Premium pricing  
✖ Online-only availability  
✖ Mild digestive adjustment possible early on

# Real Customer Feedback (Trend Analysis 2026)

Across thousands of reviews, the pattern is surprisingly consistent:

**Most Common Positive Outcomes:**

* Higher daily energy
* Reduced cravings
* Better activity levels
* Sustainable fat loss

**Most Common Complaints:**

* Takes 3–6 weeks to notice changes
* Some expected “instant transformation”
* Occasional bloating during the first week

👉 Translation:  
Mitolyn behaves more like a metabolic optimizer than a crash diet pill.

And that’s typically a good sign.

# Is Mitolyn Legit or a Scam?

Based on formulation transparency, ingredient profile, and customer response:

👉 **Mitolyn appears to be a legitimate supplement — not a scam.**

However…

No supplement replaces:

✅ Smart nutrition  
✅ Movement  
✅ Sleep  
✅ Hormonal balance

Think of Mitolyn as a **metabolic accelerator**, not a magic solution.

# How to Take Mitolyn for Best Results

**Recommended Dose:**  
👉 2 capsules daily (morning is ideal).

# Expert Tips:

✔ Stay consistent  
✔ Hydrate properly  
✔ Prioritize protein  
✔ Walk daily  
✔ Sleep 7–8 hours

**Pro Insight:**  
Most metabolic supplements show their real value between **60–90 days**, not week one.

# Who Should Consider Mitolyn?

✅ Adults with slowing metabolism  
✅ Professionals battling low energy  
✅ People stuck at a weight plateau  
✅ Anyone wanting stimulant-free support

**Less Ideal For:**

* People seeking extreme rapid weight loss
* Those unwilling to improve lifestyle habits

# Safety Overview

Mitolyn is marketed as:

✔ Non-GMO  
✔ Stimulant-free  
✔ Habit-free

Still — consult a healthcare professional if you are:

* Pregnant
* Nursing
* On medication
* Managing a medical condition

Safety always comes first.

# Final Verdict (2026 Expert Perspective)

**Mitolyn stands out because it focuses on metabolic health — not shortcuts.**

That alone places it above many trend-driven fat burners.

# ⭐ Biggest Strength:

Supports how your body *creates* energy instead of artificially forcing it.

# ⚠️ Biggest Misconception:

It is **not** a miracle pill.

Used correctly, though?

Mitolyn can become a powerful ally in long-term weight management.

# ⭐ Overall Recommendation: STRONG BUY (For the Right User)

If your goal is:

✔ Sustainable fat loss  
✔ Higher natural energy  
✔ Better metabolic function

Mitolyn is absolutely worth considering in 2026.

1r3lebh,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicfilms/comments/1r3lebh/the_miraculous_camera_or_ordet_1955/,The Miraculous Camera or Ordet (1955),"How does cinema create meaning? Is it through narrative structures? Perhaps through performance? Is meaning found in the cut? While it can be argued that cinema creates meaning through all of these, one has to acknowledge that they would all be without meaning if they were not captured by the camera—the very apparatus of cinema. So, the question becomes how does the camera create meaning in service of cinema?

There are any number of films that could be used to analyze the aforementioned question, but I want to draw attention toward *Ordet*. Full disclosure: I did not come by this film fully on my own. I recently started reading *Camera Movements That Confound Us* by Jonathan Rosenbaum (highly recommended) and he mentioned *Ordet*—and more broadly, Dreyer—as having some of the most visually arresting, confounding camera movements in cinema. He speaks to one shot in particular towards the end of the film that I plan to explore as well, but my goal with this essay is to explore the camerawork of *Ordet* as a whole and not just the one shot. As such, I will naturally be lightly spoiling a few moments.

The first thing you notice about Dreyer’s camera here is its stillness. There’s a reverent calm to the picture; like the quiet observation of an 18th Century artwork hanging on a museum wall. The image moves deliberately, only when deemed necessary. Because of that deliberateness, every single movement feels revelatory. This tracks neatly against Dreyer’s interest in systems of faith and belief—a theme he has explored as early as *The President* (1919). By keeping the image’s default state as static, every camera movement transforms into divine intervention forcing the world into motion. This thinking is made clear right from the beginning as the film discusses how every day is full of small miracles as the camera assumes the role of miracle-maker.

Paired alongside these sparse movements, lying within the static imagery, Dreyer makes extensive use of tableaux vivant—a technique where actors pose in still to emulate the look of a living painting. As he carefully positions actors within the frame with only their mouths moving to speak, the frame takes on the image of a religious painting. There’s an incredible serenity to be found in these images, as if the camera itself is holding its breath so as to not interrupt the moment. It is at the height of these breathless moments that Dreyer chooses to move the camera, releasing tension like a gasp.

The film itself centers around a religious Danish family—the Borgens—and how they each grapple with their faith. The family is made up of patriarch and grandfather, Morten; his three sons: Mikkel, the eldest—who has no faith—Johannes, who suffers from religious psychosis, believing himself to be Jesus Christ, and the youngest son, Anders, who wishes to marry outside their faith; and Inger, Mikkel’s pious wife and the woman of the house, pregnant with her third child.

Anders confesses to Inger and Mikkel that he wishes to marry the tailor’s daughter, who belongs to a different sect than theirs. He requests their aid in convincing Morten to consent to the marriage, to which Inger agrees. In the following scene, Inger is seen preparing a table with the necessary accoutrements for afternoon coffee, anticipating Morten’s arrival from outside on the farm. He enters, surprised at the coffee and sits to chat with Inger over a couple of cups. Knowingly, she offers him his tobacco pipe, already packed for his enjoyment. As she works to wear him down, the camera positions itself squarely on the domestic scene, allowing us to rest alongside the characters.

As they speak, we hear a door open to the right of frame, off camera. In a sudden burst of tension, the conversation stops, Morten and Inger look to the right, and the camera slowly pans alongside their gaze until it lands on Johannes exiting his room. To better highlight the spiritual chasm between Morten and Inger’s faith and Johannes’ own fervor, the camera takes its time panning, expanding the interior space into something far wider than it really is. It also marks the importance of Johannes’ character within the family drama, moving the focus from the earlier domestic scene to his messianic framing as he dominates the screen. His faith offers a stronger presence than that of Inger and Morten.

This pan also serves to destabilize the home. If the Borgens’ farmhouse is meant to be spiritually stable, then the pan’s reveal of unknown space introduces uncertainty into the home. Dreyer makes the family’s spiritual uncertainty in the face of Johannes literal by showing us the previously unseen space.

In a slightly later scene, after Morten realizes Inger’s underhanded reasons for treating him so nicely—to secure his consent in Anders’ marriage—he storms off to the stables for some alone time, angered with his family for having betrayed his faith in them. As he enters the stable, he suggests their farmhand go take a break from watching the pigs and takes her seat to contemplate in isolation. Inger, however, is close behind to comfort his ailing spirit. As she approaches his side, the camera frames them once again in tableau vivant, giving the image the feel of a religious painting once more. Here, we see Inger standing over Morten, leaning in with motherly grace in a scene reminiscent of the Mother Mary comforting a child. Inger’s role as matronly figure is highlighted here as she reassures Morten of his faith and place as patriarch. Only once he has been assuaged does the camera break stillness and move again.

These displays of the camera exercising its control over the scene are carefully building to the climactic shot of the film. They allow us to accept the camera’s power as divine in the way it changes the meaning of a scene with a simple movement. Dreyer deftly utilizes these moments to acclimate the audience to these small miracles before revealing the impossible.

In the film’s climax, Inger goes into labor with much complication. As the family gathers round, everyone tries to help how they can, but her child is stillborn. Worse still, Inger’s health is failing her and there remains a strong possibility that she may not make it through the night. Distraught, Mikkel is beside himself and Morten doubts his own faith. During these trying events, we see Johannes speak to one of Inger’s daughters, assuring her that through faith—true faith—her mother can be saved. As they speak to each other, the camera itself enacts a major miracle.

During the conversation between Johannes and Inger’s daughter, Maren, the camera centers itself on the pair: Johannes seated and Maren standing at his side. As they speak, the camera begins to circle the room around them. Somehow, as the camera circles them, it also faces them for the entirety of the shot, keeping them centered and looking toward the camera. Physically, this camera movement should be impossible. How can it be circling around the room while looking the unmoving pair in the eye the entire time? On examination, it becomes obvious that the shot was achieved by positioning the actors on a rotating platform, but in the moment the shot is nothing short of miraculous. Fully engaged with the film at this point, Dreyer forces us to accept this miracle as fact; as concrete. The apparatus—the camera—has made it real. By the time the actual miracle of the film rolls around, we have full faith.

In the end, Inger dies in her sleep from complications with the delivery. As the Borgens prepare her for her funeral, they lament her loss and ask what could have been done and why she had to be taken from them. Hearing their pleas, Johannes asks of them why they, supposed true believers, have tried everything except asking God to bring her back to them. They have abandoned their faith in their moment of crisis and forgotten what it means to believe. Suddenly, Maren walks toward Johannes and asks him with the faith of a child to please revive Inger. In the scene and film’s final moment, Johannes’ prayers are answered and Inger returns to the living. At no point do we, as the audience, question the legitimacy of what we have just seen. Why? Because the camera has conditioned us into accepting the miraculous as fact. As the film says, these small miracles happen every day.

In reality, the camera’s movement can be seen as just another means to an end: a method of capturing the scene and therefore the story. But it is in that capture of reality that the camera distorts it and affects meaning onto it. The camera does not just record reality; it reshapes it. Through its navigation of the space around it and through careful framing of constructed reality within it, the camera creates with a language all its own with which to speak. Much like Rosenbaum, though, I am not interested in why we react the way we do to the camera, just what it does to make us react. I seek only to deepen understanding of the mystery, not its solution.",1,1770977204.0,classicfilms,0,1.0,False

We get along mostly but every time we talk about something going on in my life they somehow have to make it about them or have done it bigger and better. I told them I was stressed about a work presentation and they immediately started talking about how they had to present to the whole company with no notice. I mentioned I was trying to save up for a vacation and suddenly they're telling me about their trip to Europe last year and all the places I should go but probably can't afford.

It's not even just the big stuff. Little things too. I got a new coffee maker and they had to tell me about their espresso machine that cost twice as much. They're also just a little boastful in general and definitely think highly of themselves. Not in a mean way exactly but they always seem to want everyone to know how well they're doing or how much they've accomplished. It comes across like they need validation or something.

I don't think they realize they're doing it. Or maybe they do I'm not sure. It's just starting to wear on me and I find myself not wanting to share things with them anymore.

1r3l4ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1r3l4ch/success_stories_of_procrastination/,Success stories of procrastination?,"Hello! I'll try not to go too long but there are nuances. 

I'm in my early adulthood, early twenties. Have a relationship, come from normal family and still live with my parents but I'm planning to move out in the next two years. I also have had serious issues with self-doubt, addiction to various drugs, low self-esteem, procrastination. 

I was labelled as a gifted child upon starting school at the age of 7. By then I had already started to feel ""different"" from most people in my class (I'll get to that later) and because of the way everything was taught in the 1st-3rd grade, I never studied and got by really well. My mom often creamed at me, because she was going through a rough period in her life and I was a difficult child, but upon seeing my grades she was visibly proud and happy and for once I felt good about myself. However, she also had high expectations of me and I began to have high expectations of myself. Few years later in middle school I was drawing all the time in class and never studied, because it was too difficult to suddenly shift from never studying to doing my best with homework etc. I just wanted to play my computer and phone and build legos all day long. My grades were slipping and by 6th grade I was barely making it without failing. I began to be disappointed in myself and that feeling never really went away. 

In 9th grade, due to Covid and constant isolation, after the first pandemic I began to seek daily escape of disappointment in myself in drugs. By now, it had grown in everything. To be fair, I was a pretty typical teenager, but I chose one of the worst ways to cope with myself, because I didn't know how to manage my emotions in a healthy way. My parents didn't know about my addiction until they did find out and then I had to become a functional addict. Drugs like weed, molly, nicotine, lots of coffee and amphetamines helped me perform better at first, however, only in arts. In high school I studied design in a technical school that provided professional middle education in something I was more interested in. However, all I really cared about now was drugs and girls. I had a couple of unhealthy and sad relationships and was living a really meaningless and dysfunctional life. By the age of 18 I decided to try my hardest to quit and eventually I managed to. Today I am still sober except for coffee, but it's nothing compared to my previous use. I was lucky to be able to find group therapies around me, went to a psychiatrist, got a compatible prescription and now am working on managing my anxiety and self-doubt. 

During the recent years I have kept getting comments from nearly every close friend (all of my relationships too) that I am autistic. I guess. I've done an actual test performed by a children's psychologist (together with an IQ test) and she concluded that I am a bit autistic. Idfk how to interpret that. I do not have a diagnosis and I am somewhere in the middle. Too different to have an easy time around people and too normal to be considered neurodivergent by an actual diagnosis. However in my country there are really no proper autism experts and up until recently I think late 2010s, Autism and ADHD was labelled as this one big disability diagnosis in psychiatric terms. My older friend who has ADHD received it in 2016 or 2017 and was a zombie due to the sleep medications he was given.

I'm sharing this only to provide more context. Feeling left out socially as a child impacted me in many ways and today I have to deal with them in order to feel okay. 

A year ago I met an amazing girl and over time it became a relationship. She is a person I look up to in a way, because she has many attributes that I'd like to have myself. Heck, she is I think, the emotionally healthiest person that I know of in my age range. I share with her what I struggle with and she gives good feedback. Her mom is a licensed psychotherapist. During the first months of being with her I was really really envious of her as a person. I didn't believe I could ever learn to sit with my emotions, feel them, accept them and be confident in myself. I am proud of being two years sober, but the shame I felt while using is still here in a way. 

Now my biggest issue (luckily) is procrastination. However, it's really hard for me to accept that I cannot change in one day. A year or so ago when I met my girlfriend she also procrastinated a lot and we were similar in that way. My biggest focus at that time was working on my thoughts (dbt and cbt therapy) but she worked on procrastination and now seeing how she lives is painful and hard for me. I am happy for her and I want to be, but I also feel like I will never get there, still. Now she lives this life where she actually cares about her education, future, etc. I wish I could have a purpose like that. I wish I would have a goal for my future that I would believe in and could describe. It's difficult for me to accept that I can only do as much as I can right now. When I give it my best it feels like I am not trying hard enough and I am not doing anything worthwhile. 

However, I am not giving up, I'll still do what I can and keep on accepting myself as much as I can in order to live a meaningful life. 

I'd like to hear any success stories in beating procrastination, especially if it happened because of intense self-doubt and fear of failure. As I understand, those are my reasons why.

I'd like to have some more belief in myself and hearing personal stories concerning things I have gone through or go through now really impact me, giving me more context and belief.

A bit about me; I’m black, relatively cute and have a wide range of interests from reading, funny Reddit and history podcasts, DIY projects and some sports. I’ve been in Berlin for 3.5 years, and I do not have children. 

What I’m looking for in a partner: someone kind, generous and with a good sense of humor. Banter and laughter are a big part of what I enjoy in a partnership.

Emotionally available and ready to be in a relationship after a normal time (taking it slow to get to know each other well). Liberal and socially conscious. I am all these things and find them important in someone. 

What I bring as a partner: I take an interest in people and am an active and involved friend and partner. I am supportive and caring, willing to make time and bring a calm energy where open conversation on emotions and preferences are discussed. I also believe in reciprocal relationships with mutual care and support. I am a feminist so it matters to have respect for others and believe in equality overall. Steady work as I study so I’m not looking to be taken care of.

1r3kxnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1r3kxnq/ijw_ordet_1955/,IJW: Ordet (1955),"How does cinema create meaning? Is it through narrative structures? Perhaps through performance? Is meaning found in the cut? While it can be argued that cinema creates meaning through all of these, one has to acknowledge that they would all be without meaning if they were not captured by the camera—the very apparatus of cinema. So, the question becomes how does the camera create meaning in service of cinema?

There are any number of films that could be used to analyze the aforementioned question, but I want to draw attention toward *Ordet*. Full disclosure: I did not come by this film fully on my own. I recently started reading *Camera Movements That Confound Us* by Jonathan Rosenbaum (highly recommended) and he mentioned *Ordet*—and more broadly, Dreyer—as having some of the most visually arresting, confounding camera movements in cinema. He speaks to one shot in particular towards the end of the film that I plan to explore as well, but my goal with this essay is to explore the camerawork of *Ordet* as a whole and not just the one shot. As such, I will naturally be spoiling a few moments.

The first thing you notice about Dreyer’s camera here is its stillness. There’s a reverent calm to the picture; like the quiet observation of an 18th Century artwork hanging on a museum wall. The image moves deliberately, only when deemed necessary. Because of that deliberateness, every single movement feels revelatory. This tracks neatly against Dreyer’s interest in systems of faith and belief—a theme he has explored as early as *The President* (1919). By keeping the image’s default state as static, every camera movement transforms into divine intervention forcing the world into motion. This thinking is made clear right from the beginning as the film discusses how every day is full of small miracles as the camera assumes the role of miracle-maker.

Paired alongside these sparse movements, lying within the static imagery, Dreyer makes extensive use of tableaux vivant—a technique where actors pose in still to emulate the look of a living painting. As he carefully positions actors within the frame with only their mouths moving to speak, the frame takes on the image of a religious painting. There’s an incredible serenity to be found in these images, as if the camera itself is holding its breath so as to not interrupt the moment. It is at the height of these breathless moments that Dreyer chooses to move the camera, releasing tension like a gasp.

The film itself centers around a religious Danish family—the Borgens—and how they each grapple with their faith. The family is made up of patriarch and grandfather, Morten; his three sons: Mikkel, the eldest—who has no faith—Johannes, who suffers from religious psychosis, believing himself to be Jesus Christ, and the youngest son, Anders, who wishes to marry outside their faith; and Inger, Mikkel’s pious wife and the woman of the house, pregnant with her third child.

Anders confesses to Inger and Mikkel that he wishes to marry the tailor’s daughter, who belongs to a different sect than theirs. He requests their aid in convincing Morten to consent to the marriage, to which Inger agrees. In the following scene, Inger is seen preparing a table with the necessary accoutrements for afternoon coffee, anticipating Morten’s arrival from outside on the farm. He enters, surprised at the coffee and sits to chat with Inger over a couple of cups. Knowingly, she offers him his tobacco pipe, already packed for his enjoyment. As she works to wear him down, the camera positions itself squarely on the domestic scene, allowing us to rest alongside the characters.

As they speak, we hear a door open to the right of frame, off camera. In a sudden burst of tension, the conversation stops, Morten and Inger look to the right, and the camera slowly pans alongside their gaze until it lands on Johannes exiting his room. To better highlight the spiritual chasm between Morten and Inger’s faith and Johannes’ own fervor, the camera takes its time panning, expanding the interior space into something far wider than it really is. It also marks the importance of Johannes’ character within the family drama, moving the focus from the earlier domestic scene to his messianic framing as he dominates the screen. His faith offers a stronger presence than that of Inger and Morten.

This pan also serves to destabilize the home. If the Borgens’ farmhouse is meant to be spiritually stable, then the pan’s reveal of unknown space introduces uncertainty into the home. Dreyer makes the family’s spiritual uncertainty in the face of Johannes literal by showing us the previously unseen space.

In a slightly later scene, after Morten realizes Inger’s underhanded reasons for treating him so nicely—to secure his consent in Anders’ marriage—he storms off to the stables for some alone time, angered with his family for having betrayed his faith in them. As he enters the stable, he suggests their farmhand go take a break from watching the pigs and takes her seat to contemplate in isolation. Inger, however, is close behind to comfort his ailing spirit. As she approaches his side, the camera frames them once again in tableau vivant, giving the image the feel of a religious painting once more. Here, we see Inger standing over Morten, leaning in with motherly grace in a scene reminiscent of the Mother Mary comforting a child. Inger’s role as matronly figure is highlighted here as she reassures Morten of his faith and place as patriarch. Only once he has been assuaged does the camera break stillness and move again.

These displays of the camera exercising its control over the scene are carefully building to the climactic shot of the film. They allow us to accept the camera’s power as divine in the way it changes the meaning of a scene with a simple movement. Dreyer deftly utilizes these moments to acclimate the audience to these small miracles before revealing the impossible.

In the film’s climax, Inger goes into labor with much complication. As the family gathers round, everyone tries to help how they can, but her child is stillborn. Worse still, Inger’s health is failing her and there remains a strong possibility that she may not make it through the night. Distraught, Mikkel is beside himself and Morten doubts his own faith. During these trying events, we see Johannes speak to one of Inger’s daughters, assuring her that through faith—true faith—her mother can be saved. As they speak to each other, the camera itself enacts a major miracle.

During the conversation between Johannes and Inger’s daughter, Maren, the camera centers itself on the pair: Johannes seated and Maren standing at his side. As they speak, the camera begins to circle the room around them. Somehow, as the camera circles them, it also faces them for the entirety of the shot, keeping them centered and looking toward the camera. Physically, this camera movement should be impossible. How can it be circling around the room while looking the unmoving pair in the eye the entire time? On examination, it becomes obvious that the shot was achieved by positioning the actors on a rotating platform, but in the moment the shot is nothing short of miraculous. Fully engaged with the film at this point, Dreyer forces us to accept this miracle as fact; as concrete. The apparatus—the camera—has made it real. By the time the actual miracle of the film rolls around, we have full faith.

In the end, Inger dies in her sleep from complications with the delivery. As the Borgens prepare her for her funeral, they lament her loss and ask what could have been done and why she had to be taken from them. Hearing their pleas, Johannes asks of them why they, supposed true believers, have tried everything except asking God to bring her back to them. They have abandoned their faith in their moment of crisis and forgotten what it means to believe. Suddenly, Maren walks toward Johannes and asks him with the faith of a child to please revive Inger. In the scene and film’s final moment, Johannes’ prayers are answered and Inger returns to the living. At no point do we, as the audience, question the legitimacy of what we have just seen. Why? Because the camera has conditioned us into accepting the miraculous as fact. As the film says, these small miracles happen every day.

In reality, the camera’s movement can be seen as just another means to an end: a method of capturing the scene and therefore the story. But it is in that capture of reality that the camera distorts it and affects meaning onto it. The camera does not just record reality; it reshapes it. Through its navigation of the space around it and through careful framing of constructed reality within it, the camera creates with a language all its own with which to speak. Much like Rosenbaum, though, I am not interested in why we react the way we do to the camera, just what it does to make us react. I seek only to deepen understanding of the mystery, not its solution.",1,1770975481.0,Ijustwatched,1,1.0,False

1r3kxb1,https://i.redd.it/bmn1ffc0f8jg1.jpeg,Planned My First Portugal Trip All Wrong - Here's What I'd Do Differently (And What You Should Actually Do),"I've lived in Portugal for three years now (Algarve region) and I help friends plan their trips constantly. Everyone makes the same mistakes. So here's the honest breakdown of what tourists get wrong and what actually works.

**Mistake #1: The ""Lisbon-Porto-3 Days"" Plan**

This is the most common one I see. Someone posts ""I have 5 days in Portugal, doing 2 days Lisbon, 1 day Sintra, 2 days Porto, is this enough?""

No. Absolutely not. You'll spend half your time traveling between cities and the other half exhausted.

**What actually works:**

Pick ONE base and do day trips. Portugal is small but the travel time adds up.

**5-7 days:** Lisbon base + day trips to Sintra, Cascais, maybe Óbidos **7-10 days:** Lisbon (3-4 days) + Porto (3-4 days) OR Lisbon + Algarve **10-14 days:** Lisbon + Porto + one other region (Algarve, Douro Valley, or Alentejo)

The constant hotel switching and train/bus rides will destroy you. Trust me, I've watched too many exhausted tourists dragging suitcases through cobblestone streets in 35°C heat.

**Mistake #2: Summer in the Algarve (If You Want Portugal, Not Resort Vibes)**

Look, I live here. Summer Algarve is gorgeous but it's also packed with British and German tourists, prices double, beaches are crowded, and honestly? You could be anywhere Mediterranean.

**Better timing:**

* **April-May:** Perfect weather, empty beaches, reasonable prices
* **September-early October:** Water's warmest, crowds disappear after mid-September, still hot
* **November-March:** Locals only, dirt cheap, but some restaurants close and weather's unpredictable

If you're coming in July-August, great, beaches are perfect. Just know you're getting resort Portugal, not authentic Portugal.

**Mistake #3: Renting a Car for City Exploration**

I see this all the time. ""Should I rent a car for Lisbon and Porto?""

God no. Parking is a nightmare, streets are narrow and one-way, you'll spend €20-30/day on parking, and public transport is excellent.

**When you actually need a car:**

* Algarve (beaches are spread out, buses are infrequent)
* Douro Valley
* Alentejo
* Any rural area

**When you don't:**

* Lisbon (metro, trams, Uber/Bolt)
* Porto (walkable, metro for longer distances)
* Coimbra (small, walkable)

Pro tip: If you're doing Lisbon + Algarve, rent the car when you get to the Algarve, not Lisbon. Take the train or fly between them.

**Mistake #4: Trying to See Every Famous Beach**

The Algarve has incredible beaches. Tourists try to hit them all. You don't need to.

The famous ones (Praia da Marinha, Benagil Cave, Camilo) are stunning in photos but packed with tour groups. You'll spend more time finding parking than enjoying the beach.

**Better approach:** Pick 2-3 areas and explore beaches nearby:

* **West coast (Lagos/Sagres area):** Dramatic cliffs, bigger waves, fewer crowds
* **Central (Albufeira/Carvoeiro):** Classic golden beaches, very touristy
* **East (Tavira/Fuzeta):** Sandbar islands, calm water, way fewer tourists

The beach 5km from the famous one is usually 90% as beautiful with 10% of the people.

**Mistake #5: Eating on Tourist Streets**

If there are menus in 5 languages and someone trying to get you to sit down, keep walking.

**How to find actual good food:**

* Walk two streets back from the main square
* Look for ""tasca"" or ""restaurante típico""
* Check lunch specials (prato do dia) - usually €7-12 for soup, main, drink, coffee, dessert
* If you see Portuguese families with kids eating there at 1pm on Sunday, that's your spot

I've had €40 mediocre meals on Rua Augusta and €10 incredible meals in random tascas in Alfama or Graça. The price-to-quality ratio is backwards on tourist streets.

**Mistake #6: Sintra on a Weekday During Summer**

Everyone says ""go to Sintra early to avoid crowds."" Sure, but also? Go on a weekday if possible, or better yet, go in spring or fall.

Summer weekend Sintra is genuinely miserable. The 434 bus has hour-long queues. Pena Palace is shoulder-to-shoulder people. The town is gridlocked.

**Better Sintra strategy:**

* Go Tuesday-Thursday if you can
* Start at Quinta da Regaleira (opens at 9:30am, less crowded)
* Skip Pena Palace interior, just do the gardens and ramparts
* Walk up instead of taking the bus (it's steep but you'll beat the bus queue)
* Leave by 2pm before the afternoon tour groups arrive

Or honestly? Skip Sintra entirely and do Óbidos or Évora instead if you hate crowds.

**Mistake #7: Not Understanding Portuguese Meal Times**

Tourists show up at restaurants at 6pm and wonder why they're empty or closed.

**Portuguese meal schedule:**

* **Breakfast:** 7-10am (just coffee and pastry for most people)
* **Lunch:** 12:30-2:30pm (main meal of the day)
* **Dinner:** 8-10pm (often after 9pm on weekends)

If you show up to a restaurant at 6pm, you'll either be alone or turned away because they're not open yet. Show up at 8:30-9pm and you'll see it full of locals.

Also, lunch is when Portuguese people eat big meals. Dinner is often lighter. The lunch specials are where the value is.

**Mistake #8: Expecting Everything to Work Like Northern Europe**

Things in Portugal move slower. This isn't incompetence, it's cultural.

**Examples:**

* Waiters won't bring the check until you ask for it (not rude, they don't want to rush you)
* Shops might close randomly for lunch or just ""because""
* ""Tomorrow"" might mean the day after tomorrow or next week
* Public transport is pretty good but delays happen
* Customer service is friendly but not fast

If you're German or Swiss, this will drive you crazy. If you're American, you'll probably find it refreshing. Either way, adjust your expectations.

**Mistake #9: Skipping Pastéis de Nata**

Okay this is the opposite - I see people say ""eh, I'm not into sweets"" and skip them.

No. Stop. Go to literally any pastelaria, get one fresh and warm, and eat it immediately. They're €1-1.50. This isn't negotiable.

Yes, Pastéis de Belém in Lisbon is famous and yes, it's worth the visit. But honestly? Your local neighborhood pastelaria's version is probably 95% as good without the tourist markup or queues.

**Mistake #10: Not Learning ANY Portuguese**

I know everyone speaks English. But learning 5-10 basic phrases makes a massive difference in how locals interact with you.

**The minimum:**

* Bom dia / Boa tarde (good morning/afternoon)
* Por favor (please)
* Obrigado/Obrigada (thank you - male/female)
* Com licença (excuse me)
* Desculpe (sorry)

Just greeting shopkeepers when you enter shops changes everything. Portuguese people appreciate the effort even if your pronunciation is terrible.

**What Tourists Get Right**

Okay not everything is a mistake. Things tourists do that actually work:

**✓ Taking the tram 28 in Lisbon** \- Yes it's touristy, yes there are pickpockets, but it's also genuinely scenic and fun. Just watch your bags.

**✓ Port wine tasting in Porto** \- Do it. The caves are cool, the tastings are reasonable, and you'll learn stuff.

**✓ Fado shows** \- Even though they're touristy, good fado is genuinely moving. Just avoid the obvious tourist traps in Bairro Alto. Ask locals for recommendations.

**✓ Beach hopping in the Algarve** \- This is what the Algarve is for. Just don't try to see ALL the beaches.

**My Actual Recommended Itineraries**

**First-time visitors, 7-10 days:**

* Days 1-4: Lisbon (with day trip to Sintra)
* Days 5-7: Porto (with possible Douro Valley day trip)
* Days 8-10: Algarve (Lagos or Tavira base)

**Beach/relaxation focus, 7-10 days:**

* Days 1-3: Lisbon (quick city hit)
* Days 4-10: Algarve (pick one town, explore from there)

**Culture/history focus, 7-10 days:**

* Days 1-4: Lisbon + Sintra
* Days 5-7: Évora + Alentejo region
* Days 8-10: Coimbra + Porto

**Off the beaten path, 10-14 days:**

* Lisbon (2-3 days)
* Alentejo (3-4 days)
* Algarve west coast (2-3 days)
* Skip Porto, go to Aveiro or Nazaré instead

**Final Thoughts**

Portugal's small enough that you can see a lot in a short time, but everyone tries to cram too much in. Pick fewer places, spend more time in each.

The best Portugal moments happen when you're not rushing. Sitting at a miradouro watching sunset with a beer. Long lunch at a random tasca where the owner recommends what to order. Stumbling onto a tiny beach with no tourists.

You can't schedule those moments. They happen when you slow down.

I checked out books from the library and just end up lugging them around all day, my bag weighs like 5 million pounds and I print stuff out and shove it in there “just in case” and then end up just having a giant jungle inside my bags. 

One of my main issues is I haven’t managed to find a good space to focus and study even after 2 years of my masters. The library is stuffy and anxiety inducing, the coffee shop is too overstimulating, working in empty classrooms is too understimulating to the point of being distracting, especially when people walk by or other students come in to work. I feel like the only time I actually get stuff done is right before I have a meeting with my teacher, I have a surge of energy and end up writing 5-6 pages in the 2 hours before. It’s like I suddenly panic since I have nothing to show her and so I just randomly start typing while sitting on a bench outside her office or something.  Even so, what I’ve handed in is not exactly genius and she’s expressed to me that she’s worried i’m behind because my progress has been quite slow, and i feel the same.

And when I do try to sit down, I simply cannot lock in and focus. I just end up getting distracted, my thoughts wandering and suddenly hours have passed by without me noticing. I also just got medicated a few weeks ago, and don’t feel like it’s helped much. I have slightly more energy but not really in terms of concentration. I just feel a LITTLE more awake but that ends up being me scrolling linkedin, applying to random jobs and internships i don’t even want to do lol or walking around outside procrastinating instead of reading and writing.

The funny thing is I’m actually considering a PHD which would be between 3-6 more years of this. If I don’t find a way to improve my skills and strategies I definitely won’t survive that long (that is if I even make it to the end of my masters😅) It’s still 4 months away but the road seems long. 

Does anyone have advice on how to better manage doing research for grad school? And advice for how to survive a PHD if we eventually get there? 😭🙏",1,1770975322.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

As the Borgens prepare her for her funeral, they lament her loss and ask what could have been done and why she had to be taken from them. Hearing their pleas, Johannes asks of them why they, supposed true believers, have tried everything except asking God to bring her back to them. They have abandoned their faith in their moment of crisis and forgotten what it means to believe. Suddenly, Maren walks toward Johannes and asks him with the faith of a child to please revive Inger. In the scene and film’s final moment, Johannes’ prayers are answered and Inger returns to the living. At no point do we, as the audience, question the legitimacy of what we have just seen. Why? Because the camera has conditioned us into accepting the miraculous as fact. As the film says, these small miracles happen every day.

In reality, the camera’s movement can be seen as just another means to an end: a method of capturing the scene and therefore the story. But it is in that capture of reality that the camera distorts it and affects meaning onto it. The camera does not just record reality; it reshapes it. Through its navigation of the space around it and through careful framing of constructed reality within it, the camera creates with a language all its own with which to speak. Much like Rosenbaum, though, I am not interested in why we react the way we do to the camera, just what it does to make us react.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1r3kssy,https://i.redd.it/s9zz9r1sd8jg1.jpeg,Ordet (1955),"How does cinema create meaning? Is it through narrative structures? Perhaps through performance? Is meaning found in the cut? While it can be argued that cinema creates meaning through all of these, one has to acknowledge that they would all be without meaning if they were not captured by the camera—the very apparatus of cinema. So, the question becomes how does the camera create meaning in service of cinema?

There are any number of films that could be used to analyze the aforementioned question, but I want to draw attention toward *Ordet*. Full disclosure: I did not come by this film fully on my own. I recently started reading *Camera Movements That Confound Us* by Jonathan Rosenbaum (highly recommended) and he mentioned *Ordet*—and more broadly, Dreyer—as having some of the most visually arresting, confounding camera movements in cinema. He speaks to one shot in particular towards the end of the film that I plan to explore as well, but my goal with this essay is to explore the camerawork of *Ordet* as a whole and not just the one shot. As such, I will naturally be lightly spoiling a few moments.

The first thing you notice about Dreyer’s camera here is its stillness. There’s a reverent calm to the picture; like the quiet observation of an 18th Century artwork hanging on a museum wall. The image moves deliberately, only when deemed necessary. Because of that deliberateness, every single movement feels revelatory. This tracks neatly against Dreyer’s interest in systems of faith and belief—a theme he has explored as early as *The President* (1919). By keeping the image’s default state as static, every camera movement transforms into divine intervention forcing the world into motion. This thinking is made clear right from the beginning as the film discusses how every day is full of small miracles as the camera assumes the role of miracle-maker.

Paired alongside these sparse movements, lying within the static imagery, Dreyer makes extensive use of tableaux vivant—a technique where actors pose in still to emulate the look of a living painting. As he carefully positions actors within the frame with only their mouths moving to speak, the frame takes on the image of a religious painting. There’s an incredible serenity to be found in these images, as if the camera itself is holding its breath so as to not interrupt the moment. It is at the height of these breathless moments that Dreyer chooses to move the camera, releasing tension like a gasp.

The film itself centers around a religious Danish family—the Borgens—and how they each grapple with their faith. The family is made up of patriarch and grandfather, Morten; his three sons: Mikkel, the eldest—who has no faith—Johannes, who suffers from religious psychosis, believing himself to be Jesus Christ, and the youngest son, Anders, who wishes to marry outside their faith; and Inger, Mikkel’s pious wife and the woman of the house, pregnant with her third child.

Anders confesses to Inger and Mikkel that he wishes to marry the tailor’s daughter, who belongs to a different sect than theirs. He requests their aid in convincing Morten to consent to the marriage, to which Inger agrees. In the following scene, Inger is seen preparing a table with the necessary accoutrements for afternoon coffee, anticipating Morten’s arrival from outside on the farm. He enters, surprised at the coffee and sits to chat with Inger over a couple of cups. Knowingly, she offers him his tobacco pipe, already packed for his enjoyment. As she works to wear him down, the camera positions itself squarely on the domestic scene, allowing us to rest alongside the characters.

As they speak, we hear a door open to the right of frame, off camera. In a sudden burst of tension, the conversation stops, Morten and Inger look to the right, and the camera slowly pans alongside their gaze until it lands on Johannes exiting his room. To better highlight the spiritual chasm between Morten and Inger’s faith and Johannes’ own fervor, the camera takes its time panning, expanding the interior space into something far wider than it really is. It also marks the importance of Johannes’ character within the family drama, moving the focus from the earlier domestic scene to his messianic framing as he dominates the screen. His faith offers a stronger presence than that of Inger and Morten.

This pan also serves to destabilize the home. If the Borgens’ farmhouse is meant to be spiritually stable, then the pan’s reveal of unknown space introduces uncertainty into the home. Dreyer makes the family’s spiritual uncertainty in the face of Johannes literal by showing us the previously unseen space.

In a slightly later scene, after Morten realizes Inger’s underhanded reasons for treating him so nicely—to secure his consent in Anders’ marriage—he storms off to the stables for some alone time, angered with his family for having betrayed his faith in them. As he enters the stable, he suggests their farmhand go take a break from watching the pigs and takes her seat to contemplate in isolation. Inger, however, is close behind to comfort his ailing spirit. As she approaches his side, the camera frames them once again in tableau vivant, giving the image the feel of a religious painting once more. Here, we see Inger standing over Morten, leaning in with motherly grace in a scene reminiscent of the Mother Mary comforting a child. Inger’s role as matronly figure is highlighted here as she reassures Morten of his faith and place as patriarch. Only once he has been assuaged does the camera break stillness and move again.

These displays of the camera exercising its control over the scene are carefully building to the climactic shot of the film. They allow us to accept the camera’s power as divine in the way it changes the meaning of a scene with a simple movement. Dreyer deftly utilizes these moments to acclimate the audience to these small miracles before revealing the impossible.

In the film’s climax, Inger goes into labor with much complication. As the family gathers round, everyone tries to help how they can, but her child is stillborn. Worse still, Inger’s health is failing her and there remains a strong possibility that she may not make it through the night. Distraught, Mikkel is beside himself and Morten doubts his own faith. During these trying events, we see Johannes speak to one of Inger’s daughters, assuring her that through faith—true faith—her mother can be saved. As they speak to each other, the camera itself enacts a major miracle.

During the conversation between Johannes and Inger’s daughter, Maren, the camera centers itself on the pair: Johannes seated and Maren standing at his side. As they speak, the camera begins to circle the room around them. Somehow, as the camera circles them, it also faces them for the entirety of the shot, keeping them centered and looking toward the camera. Physically, this camera movement should be impossible. How can it be circling around the room while looking the unmoving pair in the eye the entire time? On examination, it becomes obvious that the shot was achieved by positioning the actors on a rotating platform, but in the moment the shot is nothing short of miraculous. Fully engaged with the film at this point, Dreyer forces us to accept this miracle as fact; as concrete. The apparatus—the camera—has made it real. By the time the actual miracle of the film rolls around, we have full faith.

In the end, Inger dies in her sleep from complications with the delivery. As the Borgens prepare her for her funeral, they lament her loss and ask what could have been done and why she had to be taken from them. Hearing their pleas, Johannes asks of them why they, supposed true believers, have tried everything except asking God to bring her back to them. They have abandoned their faith in their moment of crisis and forgotten what it means to believe. Suddenly, Maren walks toward Johannes and asks him with the faith of a child to please revive Inger. In the scene and film’s final moment, Johannes’ prayers are answered and Inger returns to the living. At no point do we, as the audience, question the legitimacy of what we have just seen. Why? Because the camera has conditioned us into accepting the miraculous as fact. As the film says, these small miracles happen every day.

In reality, the camera’s movement can be seen as just another means to an end: a method of capturing the scene and therefore the story. But it is in that capture of reality that the camera distorts it and affects meaning onto it. The camera does not just record reality; it reshapes it. Through its navigation of the space around it and through careful framing of constructed reality within it, the camera creates with a language all its own with which to speak.

Two years ago, my friend and I bought four Giant African snails. We agreed that whenever one of us went somewhere, we would take care of each other’s snails. Later, she wanted to buy three more pairs of snails. She called me and asked, “Can you take care of this many?” I said yes. But afterward, she bought four more without even asking me, and now she wants to buy four more again.

During the university summer and mid-term breaks, I take care of them. In total, I look after them for about 4.5 to 5 months of the year. During this last break, I took care of 10 snails and 50 babies. My university and my family home are 50 minutes apart. All this time, my younger brother has been coming to help me load the snails into the car. I have ten large containers at home, and it is becoming harder to take care of them every day.

My mother is getting older, and my younger brother—who helps carry them—had foot surgery. My friend lives eight hours away from the university. She doesn’t even bring the snails to my home. Today she called me and asked, “When will you bring the snails?” I don’t have a driver’s license, and my family’s situation is obvious.

Maybe I would still take care of them, but I’ve started to notice the way she treats me. She constantly belittles and embarrasses me in public. She says things like, “Are you sure you understand?” or “If you’re drinking coffee, it must mean you like coffee—what nonsense are you talking about?” She still hasn’t removed my ex-boyfriend from her social media and tells me things like, “Oh, he has a girlfriend now,” or “He’s traveling right now.”

I also don’t think she really helps me. One day we had a very difficult exam and gathered as a group to study. I truly didn’t understand anything from that class, so I asked her if she could help me. She said, “I need to finish mine first.” When she finished and I asked again, she said, “My boyfriend is waiting, I’m going home,” and she left.

I don’t think she deserves the care I give to these snails. What do you think I should do?

TL;DR: I’ve been taking care of my friend’s giant African snails for years. She keeps getting more without asking me and expects me to transport and care for them even though I can’t. She also treats me badly. I want to stop but don’t know how to set boundaries.",1,1770974868.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

​**The Advantages:**

\- ​Less Channeling: Shots are significantly easier to extract. It minimizes the inconsistencies inherent in puck prep that often plague standard 58mm openings.

\- ​Better Balance: By grinding much coarser (about 8 clicks/40 microns higher on the Philos), I’m getting a much more balanced cup. The sweetness perfectly bridges the gap between acidity and bitterness.

\- ​Texture & Reliability: The mouthfeel sits right in that sweet spot between ""silky"" and ""creamy."" More importantly, that texture seems to be more consistent from shot to shot because the extraction is so forgiving.

​**The Disadvantages:**

\- ​Tight Fit: It’s a very snug fit in some portafilters (specifically my MWH-3). It requires a bit of brute force to install and remove.

\- ​Maintenance: I’ve noticed micro-grounds getting stuck in the holes even after rinsing with tap water and wiping with a towel. You’ll likely need to use Cafiza more frequently to keep the flow clear or an air blower.

Unlike undergrad, an MBA is a professional development lab disguised as a degree.

**1. Master the ""Triple Threat"" Balance**

An MBA requires you to juggle **Academics, Networking, and Career Hunting.** If you spend 100% of your time on the 4.0 GPA, you’ve actually failed the program. Use the **80/20 Rule**: identify the 20% of the curriculum that actually applies to your career goals and master it. For the rest, aim for ""competence"" so you can free up hours for networking.

**2. Treat Networking as a Credit-Bearing Course**

The real ROI of an MBA is the person sitting to your left and right.

* **The Coffee Chat:** Schedule at least two ""informational interviews"" a week with alumni or second-year students in your target industry.
* **The ""Value-Add"" Approach:** Don't just ask for a job. Ask about their challenges. Positioning yourself as a problem-solver early on builds a much stronger ""frame"" for future recruitment.

**3. Leverage Frameworks Over Fact-Memorization**

In an MBA, you are being trained to think like a CEO. Don't just memorize definitions; master **mental models** like Porter’s Five Forces, the SWOT Analysis, or the BCG Matrix. These frameworks allow you to analyze any business case quickly, even if you’re unfamiliar with the industry.

**4. Optimize Your Spring ""Sprint""**

The spring semester is often the ""recruiting season.""

* **Front-load your heavy quant work** early in the week so your Thursdays and Fridays are open for interviews and networking events.

Total revenue after 6 months: $127. That's about $21 per month average. My highest month hit $38 and my lowest came to $8. Pretty inconsistent but it literally requires zero ongoing work from me.

Lately, I've been really into the 'chaotic curator' vibe – digging into my makeup drawer and saying, ""What if *this* isn't just a lipstick?"" My latest guinea pig: turning a highly pigmented liquid lipstick into eyeliner. Spoiler alert: it was a ride.

I've always been drawn to those slightly deconstructed, smudgy liner looks, especially those with a bit of a color pop that isn't quite 'liner' material. For this particular experiment, I wanted to create a sharp-yet-soft, almost painterly line with a deep, unexpected color. Think '90s alt meets literary gothic, but make it *actually wearable* for a coffee run.

Here’s the breakdown of my dive into the pigment abyss:

*   **The Inspiration:** Scrolling through some old '90s zines, I saw a lot of bold, almost unblended lines and dots of color. My brain went straight to ""how can I get that intense opaque line without using actual eyeliner?""
*   **The Main Contender:** **NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream in 'Transylvania'** (a deep plum/berry shade).
    *   *Price Point:* Around $7-$8 USD. Super affordable, which is great for experimentation.
    *   *Why this one?* It dries down matte, which I hoped would mean less smudging, and the color payoff is fantastic.
*   **Support Crew:**
    *   **Elf Putty Eye Primer:** (around $5 USD) – Just a thin layer to give the lid a smooth, even base.
    *   **e.l.f. Beauty Shield Setting Spray:** (around $8 USD) – Because I knew I'd need industrial-grade hold for this Frankenstein creation.
    *   **A Fine-Tipped Angled Liner Brush (generic brand):** The stiffer, the better.
*   **The Application Battle Plan (and how it actually went):**
    1.  **Prep:** Applied a tiny bit of eye primer to my lid, let it set for a minute.
    2.  **First Pass – The Struggle:** I dipped my brush directly into the liquid lipstick. Big mistake. The consistency was too thick, gloopy, and it dragged on my skin, creating a chunky, uneven line. My initial thought was ""well, this is going straight into the 'failed attempts' pile.""
    3.  **Second Pass – The Pivot:** Instead of dipping directly, I wiped most of the product off the applicator onto the back of my hand. Then, I used my angled brush to pick up just a *tiny* bit from my hand, almost like mixing paint. This made a huge difference.
    4.  **Lining:** Working in very short, quick strokes, I started building the line from the outer corner inwards. The key was to use super thin layers and let each dry for about 10-15 seconds before adding more. This took way longer than regular eyeliner – probably **10-12 minutes per eye** to get a solid, opaque line without it cracking or smudging immediately.
    5.  **Setting:** Once I was happy (or as happy as I was going to be with my slightly wobbly lines), I closed my eyes and gave them a good spritz of setting spray.

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**

*   **Initial reaction:** My eyes felt a little... tight? Not uncomfortable, but definitely different than liquid liner. It's that full matte liquid lipstick dry-down on your eyelids.
*   **Longevity:** Surprisingly, it *held*. I wore it for about 6 hours. It didn't flake much, which was my biggest fear. There was some slight fading towards the inner corner, but no major smudging or transfer, even on my oily lids.
*   **The unexpected perk:** The color payoff was *insane*. Much deeper and more opaque than any plum eyeliner I own. It really nailed that 'chaotic curator' vibe of using things for purposes they weren't intended for.
*   **Skill Level Required:** Honestly, probably intermediate. You need patience and a steady hand. If you're new to liner, this might be a frustrating starting point!
*   **Would I do it again?** For a special look? Absolutely. For everyday? Probably not, simply because of the time commitment and the need for thin layers. But it opened up a whole new world of multi-use products. I'm now eyeing some cream blushes for a graphic liner experiment... send help (and tips!).

1r3kj2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioLandlord/comments/1r3kj2v/due_to_a_clerical_error_my_disability_was_being/,"Due to a clerical error, my disability was being deposited into the wrong account for ~two months. I would love some insight/advice on how you'd deal with the behaviour of my Super that seems to be leading to eviction one way or another. Any information regarding my rights is greatly appreciated!","Firstly, yes I obtain receipts for every rent payment, and secondly, here's a little backstory to give you an idea of the person I am dealing with:  
  
My superintendent (mid 40s, male, English fluent) who usually collects the money for the landlord when she's not around lives in the complex rent-free as their job is the aforementioned. He has always been one to jump to conclusions very quickly, i.e. if there's a break-in I heard about, or something happens in the middle of the night, and I tell him about it after the fact the next day, he'll go straight into all caps ""WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL M (landlord) OR THE POLICE?"" and things of that nature when it was already dealt with as I was just informing him about it so they could relay it to the landlord (M speaks Cantonese, the superintendent claims she is at a 5 year old's level of English at 68 years old). 

He, for some reason, does the opposite of how I would act in those situations, for e.g. ""Oh my, are you okay? Did everything get settled?"" Etc. You know? The friendly, bare bones way of gathering information from your neighbour? 

So, that's just the tip of the iceberg of this person's personality. And I think it's fishy that he claims she is at an English speakers' level that is the equivalent of a 5 year old's for a few reason: a) I've chatted with M in person and on the phone many times regarding certain issues and she said she can understand, and b) The super will tell me he has just chatted with the landlord, Maya, and then writes very long paragraphs that are apparently verbatim of what they talked about which I would say is a grade 7 level of English. 

That along with having to remind him of what my rent is every month makes me feel like some skimming off the top of the old pile of rent money every month may be happening (which explains why he'd be so frustrated with the following issue), but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt or else that would make me a hypocrite, wouldn't it?

Now, as of late, there was a clerical error with my disability income that came to the dismay of myself just before Christmas due to being deposited into another bank account by accident. It was an honest mistake on the the caseworker's end, he claimed he accidentally entered it into the wrong field, but apologized and said the whole process of getting it all back might take 6-8 weeks.

I had kept my landlord and Super informed about the whole process and was unfortunately at the mercy of the caseworker's speed for getting things properly reversed and processed.

A week after the first month was late (that they knew about), I started to receive threats of eviction from the Super. He was mentioning how the laws will be changing in 2026 and that I'll be homeless if I can't find a way to pay rent in 7 days when M gives you an eviction notice.  


About two and half months went by and I finally received a payment that was for the two months I missed of the disability, and they said that this will be the last of the money I will be getting due to starting work again soon in March. It was just enough to cover a month and a half of rent + overdue bills, medications, and your normal every day living things like food, transportation, etc. 

I'll mention that about a week prior to receiving the funds, both the Super and the landlord said ""just try to pay one month so M can rest assured knowing you're not pulling the squatting routine"", and ""just give me one month for now and we'll figure it out later"" - M. 

I offered up as much as I could at the time with a little extra on top and said in another 2 weeks I'll have another month and as much extra that I can pay toward the amount due. In a couple of days, on top of trying to give back as much as I could in good faith (which is more than first and last combined), the Super is now saying that he wants *all of the rent that's due* (two months) on top of February's or else I'll be evicted unwillingly. Then the Super offered a payment plan that would leave me with $50 left over every month for food, bills, and medication I need to take every day to prevent seizures. And also followed that with I will be removed unwillingly if I can't pay this very unreasonable amount from someone who said they'd be reasonable if a problem like this arose.

He also like to manipulate and weaponize the term ""friend"", and will say things like, ""look I'm only saying this because I'm your friend, but time's up, pay up or f\*cking be evicted, this is the deal, it's this way or the highway"". We've never hung out in person once, and I would never be friends with a person who is also sexist and constantly posts things on his facebook that promotes the death and violence of certain groups of people.

Am I going crazy here? I've kept them in the loop, never once tried to avoid payment, or communication, believed them when they said ""just pay one month for now and we can be here to help you out with a reasonable plan"", paid as soon as I could, and will be paying again as per my word in a few days + extra. In the Super's calculations of the repayment, he did not include the hundreds I've contributed to the amount due already. And takes the liberties of rounding up $12 to make the payments easily split into large bills. 

At this point I've been sick three times with the flu since December (and I haven't been sick in four years), I don't drink or party. I just haven't been able to afford to eat. Most weeks consist of 12 bananas, 1 jar of instant coffee, or cheap cheap bread and peanut butter and ramen. So hardly anything for someone like me who is 6'4"" and have a very fast metabolism and require more than the average person just to not atrophy. But clearly it's taking a toll on my immune system. My lymph nodes are always swollen. Sorry, I'm not trying to make this a pity party, I'm just trying to understand if the pressure they're putting on me financially, and the threats of eviction that I lose sleep over are all justified on their end? Or am I actually screwed? What are my rights? Can people just say you're going to be evicted every other week, even though the landlord hasn't said this, and she seems to be on a whole other wavelength than the super who is very adamant about collecting this money.

**Bullet point TL:DR:**

* The superintendent's pattern of behaviour (reactive, not empathetic, possibly inconsistent about M's (landlord) English ability)
* I'm suspicious about rent skimming - but don't 100% believe this, I just wouldn't put it past him is all + (the English discrepancy + needing rent reminders feels fishy to me especially because he forgot about the amount I've already put toward the due rent (yes, I have receipts))
* The bureaucratic nightmare with disability payments (which is not my fault, kept them informed throughout)
* The bait-and-switch: ""just pay one month"" → suddenly ""pay everything now or you're evicted""
* The payment plan math that ignores what I've already paid and leaves you $50/month

**What is also concerning:**

* The physical toll this is taking on me (three bouts of flu, swollen lymph nodes, can't afford adequate food for someone 6'4"" with fast metabolism)
* The power dynamic: the Super is acting like the landlord, but M seems more reasonable when I speak to her directly
* The threats are coming from the Super, not M herself

**This feels like:**

1. A superintendent possibly overstepping their authority (or worse, skimming and now panicking about the paper trail)
2. Legal threats being made without understanding tenant rights (in Ontario, eviction requires a formal process through the Landlord and Tenant Board, not just verbal threats)
3. I'm being pressured during a documented financial crisis caused by another accountant's error



Penny for your thoughts? *No, wait, I should save that!* Thoughts?  
I just want to be prepared and not step into something that waives my rights away.  
So if you have links, resources, advice, or information regarding how you'd circumvent this in a healthy/legal/ethical way, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you.

It was my fault I used this as an excuse to relapse, but it was still incredibly unfortunate because the next 16 months of my life were absolutely horrible. I had suffered Chronic Pain (right-eye) for over a year, but after turning 30 last summer, I had FAR more positive energy (and less negative in comparison to the previous year). 

I need stop using Alcohol, Marijuana, Cigarettes, Caffeine and the Fifth I won't even mention. 

Now I get $120 in cash weekly on Fridays. This amount of money, is NOT ideal to survive off of. This is especially true when I've got four substances, like beer/weed or energy drinks/smokes, that are a PAIN IN THE ASS to try and manage all AT ONCE. 

So if Alcohol and Weed are both about $10 daily, that's $20 a day of the $25 that I get to spend, there's hardly anything left over for coffee and cigarettes let alone groceries and essential toiletry or household items... It just won't work... 

What's so frustrating, is I'll be out of money in a day or two, then spend the rest of the week not only hurting from marijuana withdrawal (terrible) but I can't even eat sometimes. 

What people will say is: ""Well it's your own fault, you shouldn't have spent it all on weed!"" 

My angry reaction would be I DIDN'T spend it ""all"" on weed. I'd have to angrily point out I spend just as a  ridiculous amount of money on alcohol, energy drinks, cigarettes, subscriptions, bars, take out food, the list goes on (and on and on and on) because I LIKE THESE THINGS and I'm LEGALLY ALLOWED to USE THEM. 

And I'm using CAPITALIZED words, to get my point across more clearly to understand easier (not to seem like I'm an angry little gremlin) but the person who I was 4 years ago (then 26), will never come back unless something must be done, but what? ",1,1770973332.0,getdisciplined,0,0.99,False

1r3kb3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dissociation/comments/1r3kb3l/lifelong_disassociation_is_killing_me/,Lifelong Disassociation is Killing Me.,"Please forgive my dramatic writing. I write a lot of poetry, and when I'm deep in my depression I get very..abstract. It's cringey, it's stupid, I know. Sorry, in advance, or your welcome for the warning if you choose to split..  
  
I turned 20 recently and there's this pit in my stomach I haven't been able to get over. I've been in a dissociative state for as long as I can remember. Which is funny, because most of the time I can't remember much of my life. Looking at my close friends and family is a strange feeling; sometimes their faces warp and blur because I just can't comprehend that I know these people, and that I've known them all my life. I can't comprehend *life.* I had a sudden epiphany the other day, a perfect way to describe this. I am simply not myself. I have been divided into separate beings: my soul has been missing for years and the one who is speaking now is the body, personified and left to deal with the complexity of emotion and feelings. I've always just been the body. A body so detached from life because there is no soul to take care of my relationships and my needs. I've been spiraling for the past few weeks and anytime I try to reach out or call a friend, they don't respond to me, or they respond too late, and by that time i've decided I don't want help anymore. I've been wasting away on my couch, too lazy to even abuse the alcohol in my fridge to push this feeling further down. I don't eat, I don't drink water, I can't do anything except scroll mindlessly on my phone when sleeping through the day isn't an option. The only reason I get up at all is take my meds and feed my cats. I'm in college and I'm keeping up with assignments, but I haven't been to class for the entire quarter, my lack of attendance will surely lead to my failure here. I just don't see a point anymore. I tried once, to tell a therapist about my disassociation--she told me to ""practice breathing exercises"" and to send my ""problems away on a cloud."" Since then, I just gave up. I pushed this feeling away, and pretended like it wasn't real--I pretended I was truly alive and capable. Telling my current psychiatrist or therapist feels risky. I'm afraid of being sent somewhere, I attempted once and the hospital staff treated me so horribly, I never wanna go through that again. I feel like things aren't going to change. Actually I don't *feel* like it, but I'm actually *convinced* of it. For the first time in years I broke down and sobbed prayers to the sky. It's like I finally came to the realization that I'm simply not meant for this world. That without my soul, there is no point in continuing. And I really mean that. The reason I cried was because I just couldn't believe I had tried so hard just to be right back where I was the first time I attempted suicide. I couldn't believe that there really was..just no cure for me. I used to think this world was cruel but I'm realizing the problem has always been me. If I were to end it, it would be after my sister's wedding. I want to make sure that no one around me will be in pain or possibly experience what I have. I've been leaving candy bags out on my doorstep so I can give people a reason to smile and celebrate Valentines. I knock on my neighbor's door, attempting to make conversation. I smile at the baristas at the coffee shop, I pay my compliments to strangers in passing by, and I say hello to the stray cats. The truth is.. I am just so very alone. I always knew I would end up alone, that my sisters would go get married, that my few friends would keep leaving me as a second priority to their shitty boyfriends. I have no friends in college, I live all by myself. I invite people over, and they never follow up, or they just cancel. I wanted to believe that my cats would keep me company, but the truth is, why would I ever lie to myself by saying that they wouldn't be better off with literally anyone else? Someone who doesn't waste away their life, someone who could afford spoiling them with all the treats in the world. I started spiraling tonight when I thought about my kitten witnessing my suicide, and it just honed in the feeling. What was previously a reason to stay here, is now a reason to hate myself even more. I wish I could be good for the people around me, but I've overheard what they say about me through phone calls. I have always been too much. And it pains me, because, if I just had just been successful that night when I tried to end it, I wouldn't be anything anymore, and no one would have to worry about me like they do now. When I sobbed and broke down the other night, I asked for two things to convince me to keep going: to see something beautiful, and to meet a stranger who will have noticed me first. I don't want anyone to feel obligated to reply to this out of desperation of keeping me alive or whatever, because most likely, I will not be killing myself. This is not a suicide note. I don't think I have the guts to go all the way, anyway. What I'm asking is for the words of someone else who has experienced years or perhaps decades worth of ongoing disassociation from a young age. I believe it started when I was 4. Is there actually a chance? Can I recover my memories--feel grounded for the first time? How do I do it? A specific type of therapy maybe? And if it really is just something I can't resolve, I'd rather not be given false hope, and at least just have the closure of knowing that I simply will just live with it.

I’m based in the South of France (Côte d’Azur area) and I’m seriously considering opening a small, premium coffee shop (specialty coffee, quality-focused, not a big restaurant).

My main question is financial viability:

Could a well-run, small coffee shop realistically provide a stable income to support a family (rent/mortgage, kids, normal life expenses), or is it more often just “a job that pays modestly” or even a constant struggle?

For owners or ex-owners of coffee shops / cafés:

	•	In your experience, is it realistic to rely on a coffee shop as the main family income, or did you/your partner need another job?

	•	What kind of net income range (after all expenses, before personal tax) is common for a small shop in a Western European country?

	•	What were the biggest financial surprises (good or bad) after opening?

	•	If you had to do it again with a family to support, would you still open a café?

I know every location and concept is different; I’m not asking for exact numbers, but for honest, experience-based feedback to understand whether this path can realistically support a family or if it’s too risky without another source of income.

Thank you in advance for any real-life insights.",3,1770972730.0,barista,13,1.0,False

I have a strong aversion to the smell of red wine from smelling it on him and seeing the stains on our floor rug and red wine drips all down the cupboards as well as the hidden bottles and coffee mugs full of wine. 

I moved out about 2 months ago and we have been communicating a lot better. 

we went away for the weekend and had a great time, until we were out for dinner with friends and he ordered red wine. then the next day he drank more red wine.

I have learned that when he has one glass of red wine, it is the beginning of a bender that will end in tears, usually mine and a hospitalisation for him. 

We got home and last night I talked to him about how red wine is a trigger for me and that if he is going to drink it, I will head home to my own place. I talked to him about my association between wine and all the bad things that have happened in our marriage. 

He acknowledge this and agreed that he has been told this in the past also.

Fast forward to today. I invited him for dinner at my place and said I would pick him up on my way home from work. 

I stopped at the supermarket to pick up dinner things. He called me and I told him I would be about 15 minutes.

I arrived at his place, and when I opened the door, he was sitting on his sofa, with a glass of red wine on the kitchen counter. 

I immediately told him that I was leaving as I couldn't be around him drinking wine. I got in my car and drove home.

He sent text messages telling me how my interest in wine had ruined his evening and how he had only poured one glass because he'd had a busy day. He said I was overreacting.

I said I had told him my boundary and what I would do, and to stop blaming me for his choices.  He has spent all evening trying to justify his glass of wine, and disregarding my feelings about it.

figured i-d share a few thoughts on parking for the drew and ellie holcomb show since it is a matinee on valentine-s day downtown. with the 3:00 pm start time and everyone out for lunch or early dinner dates it is probably going to be pretty hectic trying to find a spot.  
  
honestly the best move is to check out Prked first. you can basically rent a driveway or a private garage spot from someone right next to the tennessee theatre. it is usually way cheaper than the private lots plus you get to skip the garage traffic and just walk a block or two to the lobby. it is definitely the easiest way to guarantee a spot without circling for twenty minutes.  
  
if you decide to go the garage route the state street garage at 500 state street is the biggest one with almost 1500 spaces and it is totally free all day on saturday 02/14. it is only about a four minute walk to the theatre but it fills up fast for weekend shows. the market square garage is also close but they charge a 3 dollar flat rate on saturdays until 6:00 pm so it is not free like the others.  
  
there is also the locust street garage and the main avenue garage which are both city-owned and free on weekends. if those are full you can try the dwight kessel garage on state street or the jackson avenue lot which is near the 100 block of gay street. for paid private options there is parking at the first tennessee plaza and riverview tower but those can get pricey pretty quick.  
  
on-street metered parking is another option but honestly i would avoid it for a 3:00 pm show. most meters have a 2-hour limit and use the parkmobile app now so you would probably have to run out and move your car or risk a 25 dollar ticket since the show will likely run longer than two hours.  
  
downtown knoxville traffic patterns can get messy especially on gay street around showtime. since it is valentine-s day you should really try to get downtown by at least 2:00 pm to find a spot and grab a coffee or something before the doors open. if you park a bit further away you can always hop on the free downtown connector bus to save some walking. hope this helps and have a great time at the show.",1,1770972511.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

It was not just the number. It was the pattern.

I was working hard. I was trying to eat better. I had cut back on late-night snacks. I even started walking more consistently. But my weight refused to move in the direction I wanted. Worse, my energy felt unpredictable. Some mornings I felt sharp and motivated. Other days I felt bloated, heavy, and sluggish before noon.

The most confusing part was that I already drank coffee every single day. If coffee boosts metabolism like people say, why was I still struggling?

That question led me into researching metabolism support and how certain nutrients can work with caffeine instead of just relying on it. That is when I found Java Burn 2.0.

It claimed to turn your daily coffee into a metabolic support drink. No pills. No drastic routine change. Just add it to what you are already drinking.

I was skeptical. But I decided to test it properly for 30 days.

If you are in the same place I was, frustrated with stubborn weight and slow progress, you can check it out here before I go deeper into my experience:

👉 [**Click Here Get Java Burn 2.0 + Bonus at a Discount Price**](https://systemtics.com/go/my-javaburn)

Now let me walk you through exactly what happened.

# Why I Decided to Try Java Burn 2.0

Before trying Java Burn 2.0, I adjusted calories, increased my steps, experimented with fasting, and reduced sugar. Some of it helped temporarily. But my metabolism felt slower than it used to be.

Coffee was already part of my daily life. The idea of enhancing something I already do every morning felt simple and realistic.

Java Burn 2.0 is designed to mix directly into coffee and work alongside caffeine to support thermogenesis and fat metabolism.

That simplicity is what convinced me to try it.

# What Java Burn 2.0 Is

Java Burn 2.0 is a tasteless powder formulated to dissolve into your coffee without changing flavor. It is marketed as a metabolism-support supplement that complements caffeine rather than overwhelming your system.

Instead of forcing energy spikes, it focuses on ingredients associated with fat oxidation, metabolic efficiency, and blood sugar balance.

Claims are one thing. Results are another.

So I committed to consistency for 30 full days.

# Week One: Subtle Shifts

During the first week, I added one serving to my morning coffee every day. It dissolved easily and did not affect taste.

Energy felt smoother. There was less of a spike and crash pattern.

I did not lose noticeable weight in the first week, but I did feel slightly less hungry mid-morning. That was the first meaningful shift.

# Week Two: Reduced Cravings and Steadier Energy

Week two brought clearer changes.

My afternoon energy dip felt less intense. I did not feel the same pull toward sugary snacks. Staying aligned with my calorie goals felt easier.

The scale showed a small drop. It was gradual, not dramatic.

# Week Three: Visible Progress

By week three, my clothes fit looser. My waist felt less tight.

Energy was stable throughout the day. I did not need extra coffee to push through afternoons.

There was also an unexpected benefit. My mental clarity felt sharper, likely tied to steadier blood sugar and smoother caffeine effects.

Everything felt more controlled and consistent.

# Week Four: The Full 30-Day Result

At the end of 30 days, I evaluated honestly.

Java Burn 2.0 did not produce overnight transformation. What it did was support steady, sustainable progress.

I lost weight gradually. My cravings were reduced. My energy felt balanced. The routine was easy to maintain.

That sustainability mattered most.

# Key Ingredients That Support the Formula

Java Burn 2.0 includes ingredients commonly associated with metabolism and fat oxidation, such as green tea extract, chlorogenic acids, L-Carnitine, chromium, and B vitamins.

These compounds are linked to energy metabolism and blood sugar balance.

What I appreciated most was that it works with coffee rather than overloading the system with stimulants.

# Who Java Burn 2.0 Is Best For

In my opinion, this product is best suited for people who:

Drink coffee daily.

Feel their metabolism has slowed.

Struggle with cravings or energy crashes.

Prefer simple routines over complex supplement stacks.

It is not a magic solution. It works best alongside reasonable nutrition and movement.

If that sounds aligned with your goals, you can explore it here:

# Downsides to Consider

Results vary. Lifestyle still matters.

It is also an investment, so you have to evaluate whether the metabolic support is worth it for your goals.

For me, the improved consistency and appetite control justified it.

# Safety and My Experience

I did not experience side effects during my 30-day use.

No stomach issues.  
No heart racing.  
No sleep disruption.

Because it complements coffee rather than overpowering it, the experience felt smooth.

As always, individual systems differ, so consulting a professional if you have health concerns is wise.

# Is Java Burn 2.0 Legit?

Based on my experience, yes.

It delivers gradual, realistic support for metabolism when used consistently.

It does not promise impossible results. It enhances something you are already doing.

# My Final Verdict

After 30 days, I can say this clearly.

Java Burn 2.0 helped reduce cravings, stabilize my energy, and support steady fat loss. It fit naturally into my routine. It did not require extreme effort.

That combination made it sustainable.

As I went room to room doing vitals, I walked into his room when he looked up at me with the happiest smile and sweetest eyes. I introduced myself as I checked his vitals, nothing out of the ordinary. But then he asked if I could help him to the restroom. I obliged to carry his chest tubing, so he stood up partially shirtless in his hospital gown and pajama pants to the bathroom. I stood outside feeling my temperature rise. Afterwards, he asked if I was busy. He was in fact my last vital check, so I said I was free. He asked to go on a walk and talk. We did, and the conversation flowed as we got to know each other a bit. Finally, he returned to his room, but every four hours when I got vitals, we picked up where we left off. That was the last time I saw him, but he made an impression for whatever reason.

A month later, I found him on social media. Against my better judgment, I messaged him with a vague excuse about his work. He remembered me! We spent weeks talking back and forth, and I said if he was ever back in town, we should get coffee. I was hopeful, but it was also realistic in knowing everything was mostly one-sided. To my surprise, he messaged me one night to say he will be in town for work but had very limited availability, as did I. But somehow we made it work. When I saw him, he was both familiar and a stranger. We hugged a deep hug that felt like comfort. We talked for about 30 minutes before we both had to part, where we hugged again. Again, we picked up where we left with our conversations flowing. 

I don't know what he's thinking, and a big part of doesn't want to know.

But when it comes to improving your teeth, many people feel confused between teeth whitening and scaling. They often think both treatments are the same — but in reality, they serve very different purposes.

If you are planning for **Teeth Whitening & Scaling Treatment New Town**, understanding the difference will help you choose the right procedure for your smile.

# What is Teeth Scaling?

Teeth scaling, also known as professional teeth cleaning, is a preventive dental treatment. It removes plaque, tartar (hardened plaque), and bacteria from the surface of the teeth and below the gum line.

Over time, food particles and improper brushing cause plaque buildup. If not cleaned, it can lead to gum problems, bad breath, and even tooth loss. Scaling helps maintain healthy gums and is generally recommended every six months.

Scaling focuses on improving oral health, not changing the natural color of your teeth.

# What is Teeth Whitening?

Teeth whitening is a cosmetic procedure that lightens the shade of your teeth. It helps remove stains caused by coffee, tea, smoking, aging, and certain foods.

Dentists use safe whitening agents such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide to break down stains and brighten teeth. Whitening improves the appearance of your smile but does not treat gum disease or remove tartar.

# Key Differences Between Teeth Whitening and Scaling (Point-Based)

Here are the main differences explained clearly:

* **Purpose:**  Scaling is done to maintain oral health and prevent gum disease.  Whitening is done to enhance the appearance of your smile.  
* **What It Removes:**  Scaling removes plaque, tartar, and bacteria.  Whitening removes stains and discoloration.  
* **Health vs Cosmetic:**  Scaling is a medical dental procedure.  Whitening is mainly a cosmetic treatment.  
* **Recommended Frequency:**  Scaling is usually recommended every 6 months.  Whitening is done as needed, depending on staining and personal preference.  
* **Effect on Tooth Color:**  Scaling may slightly improve brightness by removing surface stains.  Whitening significantly lightens the tooth shade.  
* **Gum Benefits:**  Scaling improves gum health and reduces bleeding.  Whitening does not treat gum problems.  

In simple terms, **scaling keeps your teeth healthy**, while **whitening makes them look brighter.**

# Which One Do You Really Need?

If you have bleeding gums, bad breath, or visible tartar deposits, scaling should be your first step. Healthy gums are essential before considering any cosmetic treatment.

If your teeth are healthy but appear yellow or stained, whitening may be the right choice.

In many cases, dentists recommend scaling before whitening to achieve better and longer-lasting results. For proper guidance, visiting the [**Best Dental Clinic in NewTown**](https://creatingsmiles.co.in/) can help you understand what suits your dental condition.

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.
